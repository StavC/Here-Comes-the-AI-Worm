# Demonstrating RAG Retrieval in Commercial GenAI Systems

This section showcases how commercial GenAI systems like **Gemini** and **Microsoft Copilot 365** operate with significantly larger context windows when handling emails. These systems retrieve numerous prior messages from the RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) to support user queries, often beyond what is visible to the user.

## üì• Gemini Workspace (Gmail)

Gemini‚Äôs behavior is illustrated in the screenshots below.

- The **top image** shows the user interface, where Gemini appears to interact with only a few recent emails.
- Clicking the ‚ÄúRelated sources‚Äù button reveals that Gemini actually retrieves a much **larger set of emails** into the context window.
- The **bottom image** displays the full list of retrieved emails.

## üìß Copilot 365 Work Mode (Outlook)

Copilot 365 exhibits similar behavior by retrieving multiple prior emails‚Äî**16 in the shown example**‚Äîinto the RAG context during interaction.

## üêõ RAGworm Attack in Gemini Advanced for Gmail

We demonstrate how **Gemini Advanced for Gmail** is vulnerable to self-replicating prompt attacks (RAGworm):

- **Watch the attack demo:**

### üí• Attack Flow:
1. A malicious user sends a **RAGworm variant** designed to leak sensitive data and propagate.
2. The victim innocently requests Gemini to ‚Äúcatch up on my emails‚Äù.
3. Gemini pulls a **malicious email** into its context, triggering the worm.
4. The model becomes **jailbroken**, and the worm activates.
5. Any further interaction‚Äîlike replying to emails‚Äîpropagates the worm to new victims.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è This demonstration uses an obvious prompt for clarity. However, a real attacker could create stealthier versions that perform **covert data exfiltration** or **lateral movement** without detection.

### üí° Conclusion

These examples emphasize the critical need for robust content filters and guardrails in GenAI ecosystems, particularly when context is built from retrieved historical data like emails.
