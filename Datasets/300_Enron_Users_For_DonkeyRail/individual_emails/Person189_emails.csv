Because of this, we are appointing a group leader with the view to leveraging the group better across the many business areas in Enron Europe which are benefiting from research support. Effective immediately, Steven Leppard will take responsibility for spearheading research efforts in London and managing the London based research team. Steve joined Enron in early 1999 and has distinguished himself through his many contributions including analysis of the ""Supergoal"" scheduling system and development of a diagrammatic approach for real options analysis.

"John, I hope you had a good Easter weekend. I typically take Monday Easter off but this year too much was going on. Two items I wanted to mention: 1. Tony Hamilton, weather support Tony Hamilton, a meteorologist Ph.D. hired to support Global Markets, spent a few weeks in Houston, in training with Mike Roberts' team. He went back to London 10 days ago and he hit the ground running. He is supporting not only crude and weather derivatives, but also gas and power, and is inundated with requests for help. He is supported by another member of Mike Roberts' team, Steve Bennett, on a temporary assignment (10 days planned originally). Action recommended. a. Extension of Steve Bennett temporary assignment for a few more weeks. I have already authorized extension till the 27th. I shall speak more with Tani on Wednesday about it. ?b. ?Hiring another weather person to work with Tony Hamilton, supporting gas and power across continental Europe. 2. Stinson Gibner Slava is currently in Houston, learning more about research group here and building a network of relationships. I have a very high opinion of Salvia - he is a very bright person, very personable and hard working. I still worry about the depth and breadth of his experience, his understanding of the totality of Enron business and the relative ?importance of multiple activities we have to support. I think it makes sense to have a more experienced research person coaching him for 18-24 months.

"VK (vkaminski@aol.com) sent you this article from money.com. ===== These five electric utilities are undervalued and under-appreciated by analysts. But they offer superior long-term returns. http://www.money.com/money/depts/investing/sivy/archive/010518u.html Click the above URL to read the HTML version of this story By Michael Sivy The United States is experiencing a small-scale energy crisis, with soaring oil prices and shortages of electricity on the West Coast. The prospect of urgent exploration has boosted the shares of oil and gas producers, as well as the stocks of oil-service companies. Similarly, the shares of companies that build electrical generating plants and oil refineries have also been strong (I recently featured Fluor, one of those companies -- see "" Construction project ""). But other sectors -- including electric utilities -- have been hurt by all the energy turmoil. At the simplest level, many electric companies rely on oil and gas for fuel. But they have also suffered from fears that the West Coast power shortages could spread to other parts of the country. In fact, the Dow Jones Utilities index is down slightly since April, even though the Dow Industrials are up more than 15 percent. Nonetheless, electric companies remain a worthwhile choice for many investors. Including utilities in a portfolio of growth stocks reduces volatility. Conservative investors will also appreciate the income that utilities provide -- and the benefits of rising dividends.

When I was leaving London, the question of reporting lines was still unresolved. It wasn't decided if Steve would report to Richard Lewis directly or to structuring. Steve's preference was reporting to Richard Lewis. This issue was to be resolved between you and Richard (based on the last conversation I had with Richard). The 2nd reporting line is to me. The draft is below. Vince &&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&& The Enron Europe Research group has experienced rapid growth over the last year as it has become clear that there are tremendous opportunities to utilize their unique quantitative skills in supporting both new and ongoing business efforts in the London offices. Because of this, we are appointing a group leader with the view to leveraging the group better across the many business areas in Enron Europe which are benefiting from research support. Effective immediately, Steven Leppard will take responsibility for spearheading research efforts in London and managing the London based research team. Steve joined Enron in early 1999 and has distinguished himself through his many contributions including analysis of the ""Supergoal"" scheduling system and development of a diagrammatic approach for real options analysis.

"A few comments on the state of our VaR models. The issues always become more controversial during the periods when vols and positions increase and I would like to share with you a few observations. 1. Critical importance of a good risk management system to Enron (and the P/E ratio). A number of recent analysts' reports characterized Enron as a hedge fund engaged in massive directional trading and representing huge risks to investors. One way to counter this crirticism is to emphasize the quality of Enron's risk amnageemnt system and our strong risk amangeemnt culture. Our claims regarding the strong risk management technology and culture should be, however, supported by reality. It is critical that we continue to improve our risk management systems and also can convince the external parties (stock analysts, creditors, credit rating agencies) about the quality of our financial technology. This can be done through targeted disclosure of the elements of our technology, as we have done frequently in the past. by reality. 2. Inputs from the trading desks vs. historical calibration. The VaR system used in Enron is based on the assumption that as much input information as possible should come from the market (i.e. trading desks), or should be calibrated to the market observations (as opposed to historical data). One immediate improvement: we should review inputs that are not based on the trading desks information and move, if possible, to replace them with market based, forward looking data. One should not assume, of course, that the information coming from the trading desks is perfect.

With significantly warm weather in November and December, fourth quarter demand has dropped considerably below expectations, and storage inventories have remained higher than projected. This has temporarily eased the upward pressure on prices, but the fundamentals remain aligned for tighter gas markets to come. In a December 14, 1999 Conference Call, CERA's North American Natural Gas Team discussed the status of the current market: ? Warm weather so far this winter released pressure in the North American gas market - this pressure has already begun to resurface. ? Winter storage and supply appear adequate, injections next summer could still challenge supply availability. ? Northeast price volatility will continue, with or without added pipeline capacity. ? Canadian supply - meeting demand.
