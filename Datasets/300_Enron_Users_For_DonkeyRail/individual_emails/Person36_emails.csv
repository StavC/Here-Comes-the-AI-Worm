"Hotwanger, Unemployment is not something to be taken lightly. With the right approach, it can be a richly fulfilling experience. The wrong approach can leave you unsatisfied and disenchanted. Or dissatisfied and unenchanted. Whatever. There is a bit of a science involved. A few tips: If you are living with someone...which you are...it is important that she not wake you up when she is on her way to work, as you likely have nowhere to go at that hour anyway. Tell her to blow dry her hair in the car or don't bother. If she wants you to do something to help her out, like make breakfast, pour a bowl of cereal the night before and put it in the fridge. If she gets bored with that, put it in the freezer for an icy treat. Waking up mid-afternoon may make it difficult for you to get to sleep at a decent hour, and your sleep cycle may become so offset that you are actually never awake when Tara is. That will likely become a sticking point. Drinking during the afternoon will put you in a drowsy state of mind come nightfall, and you can ensure a regular 14 hrs of slumber. There are things to do in a new city, but they are overrated. TV can and will provide whatever culture you think you need. Go outside only for beer or fast food. At some point, there may be pressure on you to ""look for a job."" That is an overly vague request.

"Hi Jay, I thought I'd send you some lite reading. May provide a distraction for you from your normal day. This is a first hand account I received from Capt Greider. He didn't (couldn't?) go into detail in some areas I would be interested in, but at least it is the true story and account. Suprisingly not a whole lot different than the media reported. The ROC vs PROC point was interesting. Shows the thought process of an insecure government. Anyway enjoy. Dad AN INSIDE LOOK AT THE CHINA RESCUE MISSION April 12, 2001 By Captain Guy Greider Continental Airlines Since the mid-air collision on April 1, 2001 between a U.S. Navy EP-3 surveillance aircraft and a Chinese jet fighter, I had watched the news with mild interest. This was mostly due to the proximity of Guam to China. I never dreamed that I would play a role in this intensely watched international drama. Somewhere in the negotiations between the United States and the Chinese Governments, it was decided that a civilian aircraft should be sent to retrieve the 24 crewmembers being detained on Hainan Island, China. A call was made to Continental Airlines headquarters in Houston, Texas. Continental was chosen because of its Guam base and its ability to launch this kind of operation at a moment s notice. From there, the operation took shape through the tireless efforts of many people working behind the scenes in a coordinated effort between the airline, the military, and the State Department.

Stanley Bing Mon Sep 03 00:00:00 EDT 2001 With the collapse of the new economy, a host of formerly employed people are now formerly employed. Having developed their skills in the nouveau operating environment, these ex-operators are now roaming the brick-and-mortar business establishments of the nation and the world, looking for ways to transfer their digital abilities to analog assignments. Unfortunately, the capabilities that were valued in the halcyon days of derring-do and flimflammery don't automatically translate to our current situation. Yet those in the digital diaspora have enormous gifts that took them to the top of their now defunct professions! Many are young and good-looking.

"Please answer all of the questions below... Are we going to look for a ring tomorrow? Do you know what size she wears? (I'm working on finding out myself) What time frame do you want to work with for an engagement? (Yes a TIME FRAME) (ie, in a week, month, year...) I have the impression that beth wants you to take care of the whole wedding thing, is this true? She says she wants to go away (deffinately tropical because she has never seen blue water) and invite close family members (parents sibblings) and close friends by sending a letter/invitation. She says they will need time to save if they are going to come, so I suggested 6 months. Does this sound appealing to you? FYI... My brother went away to get married and I have a friend who went away so I have experience in planning tropical weddings. They are great because only those who you want there come and others aren't affended for not being invited because y'all went away. You can have a dream wedding for just a little more than what a nice vacation would cost. It is alot cheaper than having one here which is probably important if y'all are paying for it. What is my budget for the ring? What is my budget for the wedding? Please answer all of the questions above to the best of your ability. This is crucial to the success of your engagement. Thanks for your help!

"[IMAGE] [IMAGE] vs [IMAGE] Merchant Development Risk in Power Generation A Henwood Multi-client Study Henwood Energy Services, Inc. (Henwood) offers an opportunity to participate in a cutting edge study of the potential collision of coal and gas and its implications for the electric industry as the battle for the fuel at the margin unfolds. The recent rise in natural gas price over the past year, culminating in a price spike of historic proportions in January 2001 has many industry participants reevaluating the role of natural gas as the ""bridge fuel"" for the twenty-first century. Some observers suspect that low cost gas reserves are tapped out, making reliance on this fuel alone imprudent from an overall portfolio standpoint. [IMAGE] Currently, there are plans in the works for nearly 40 coal power projects across North America representing 20,000 MW of capacity. Henwood's scenario-based study is designed to cost-effectively enable utilities and project developers assess the regional viability of new, commercially available coal technology using cutting edge screening analysis and their impact on new gas projects. Participation is limited - sign-up by June 15th to receive the Charter Member price and to participate in the kickoff meeting scheduled for June 20th at the Hyatt Regency Downtown, Houston. Also sign up for the Henwood ERCOT PMA Workshop on June 20th at the same location by calling Jessica Fielder at 916/569-0985.

"JZA, You'd better have a warm up game before I get down there... I should be playing at least once sometime in the next month. Maybe I'll learn a new game or two to teach you guys. So, just mark it down on your calender right now. I get into town on June 23 and I fly out the next Sunday. And Lissa's wedding has been cancelled, but I will still be haning out with Shelly on Saturday night. Any interest in an Astros game on Sunday afternoon, June 24? I figure you've got all the connections to get me into JRon field now. What night are you going to set up poker for? I'll be sure to clear my schedule for that night. Other than that, I plan on going out to eat a lot and enjoying a few margaritas while I am in town. I may need a place to crash a few nights. I think I am staying with Becky at the beginning of the week at least, though Lissa has moved in with her now, so that might get a little crowded. I'll let you know when it gets closer if I will be needing a place to crash. It would probably be good if I could stay there on poker night at least.

"Please answer all of the questions below... Are we going to look for a ring tomorrow? Do you know what size she wears? (I'm working on finding out myself) What time frame do you want to work with for an engagement? (Yes a TIME FRAME) (ie, in a week, month, year...) I have the impression that beth wants you to take care of the whole wedding thing, is this true? She says she wants to go away (deffinately tropical because she has never seen blue water) and invite close family members (parents sibblings) and close friends by sending a letter/invitation. She says they will need time to save if they are going to come, so I suggested 6 months. Does this sound appealing to you? FYI... My brother went away to get married and I have a friend who went away so I have experience in planning tropical weddings. They are great because only those who you want there come and others aren't affended for not being invited because y'all went away. You can have a dream wedding for just a little more than what a nice vacation would cost. It is alot cheaper than having one here which is probably important if y'all are paying for it.
