"The winner of the 9/15 Dave Matthews Tickets accidently bid on both pairs of tickets I had for sale (9/15 and 9/16) and only wanted one pair. He is buying the 9/16 tickets (11th row) for $345. If you are interested in the 9/15 tickets (8th row) which are even better seats, I can sell them to you for $305. Let me know asap because I am leaving town around 2pm for the weekend.
