"Definition of Event of Default - References Section 17. I believe this should be Section 14.

Also, please note that under Section 15, some of the Event of Default Sections numbers do not exist (ie. 11 and 12). Please look into these sections in their entirety. With respect to this section, I would like to change the cure period from 30 days to 3 days and of course in instances of bankruptcy, misrepresenation in the Reps & Warr, etc., there should not a cure period. With respect to credit. In reading the contract it seems that the counterparty is going to be a consortium of entities (MDEA, Yazoo & Clarksdale). Are each of the counterparties jointly and severally liable? Answers to the this relationship structure will be necessary prior to proposing credit terms for both the Master Gas and Master Power agmts. If this is the structure, we should probably look into getting legal opinions regarding the cities' authority to enter into such obligations. In addition, do the city's have authority to enter into agreements for greater than 1 yr. In my experience with other munis, they generally are, but only at the Enterprise Fund level (Public Utility). Perhaps we should confirm this. To the extent that MDEA (stand alone) is not 100% supported by the cities, we will need financial statements on MDEA. Reagan - Please forward projected load schedule when completed.
