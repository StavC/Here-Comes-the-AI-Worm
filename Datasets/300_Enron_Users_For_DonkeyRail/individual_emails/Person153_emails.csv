"Calif. power resources will be 3,752 Mw short in 2001 By David Feliciano, BridgeNews Scottsdale, Ariz.--Dec. 7--California resources and reserves for electricity will be 3,752 megawatts short of the anticipated load in 2001, California Independent System Operator (ISO) President and CEO Terry Winter said Thursday at the annual Western Systems Coordinating Council meeting. ""I'm concerned about supply,"" Winter said. ""Without sufficient supply, markets will set socially and politically unacceptable price levels (for wholesale power)"" Winter said California power resources will total 46,679 Mw in 2001, but load is expected to reach well over 50,000 Mw. Over 17,000 Mw of new generation is planned for the state, but most new power plants are not expected to begin service until 2002 and beyond. Not helping California's cause, Winter said, are reduced imports of power this year from neighboring states, down from 7,500 Mw in November of 1999 to 3,900 Mw this November. Winter also pointed to the affect of a soaring natural gas market. ""You can build generation, but in California, natural gas and emissions are the next problems. Natural gas is running into the same problem electricity has...there is a shortage."" Due in part to the above California wholesale power prices have skyrocketed since May, leading to rolling blackouts in San Francisco in June and a series of conservation emergencies since that time. The state has been under a power conservation warning much of this week. As tools to solve California power woes, Winter suggested the ISO file for an extension of price cap authority for power until markets are demonstrated to be workably competitive.

"Class Action Lawsuits Alleging Restraint of Trade and Unfair Business Practices Filed Against SoCal Gas, San Diego Gas & Electric, And El Paso Natural Gas LOS ANGELES, Dec. 18 /PRNewswire/ via NewsEdge Corporation - Two related class action lawsuits have been filed in the California Superior Court in Los Angeles, against Southern California Gas Company, San Diego Gas &amp; Electric Company, Sempra Energy (parent of the two utilities), El Paso Natural Gas Co., and other companies related to El Paso Natural Gas. The two lawsuits allege a conspiracy resulting in restraint of trade and unfair competition and unlawful business practices. The complaints summarize the issue as follows: This action involves a massive conspiracy to eliminate competition in the newly deregulated energy industry that has resulted in endangering California's electrical system and threatening California's economy. It is perhaps the largest gouging of energy consumers in American history. Southern California's current ""energy crisis"" is not simply the result of ever-increasing demand by a growing population for energy. Rather, it is the direct result of a conspiracy among the natural gas industry's most powerful Southern California players to preserve and maintain the market dominance that they enjoyed for many years as monopolies subject to regulation. When the artificial monopoly created by regulation was disassembled, those dominant companies took prompt and illegal action to ensure that they would not lose the benefits of their market power. Their unlawful collusion has contributed significantly to the recent astronomical",karen.denne@enron.com,"jeff.dasovich@enron.com, steven.kean@enron.com, richard.shapiro@enron.com,

"Enron: ISO Credit Problems Are Those Of Calif Utilities Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 12/13/2000 Dow Jones Energy Service (Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) By Mark Golden NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- The credit problems of the California Independent System Operator reflect the credit problems of the state's three investor-owned utilities, Enron Corp. (ENE) chief of staff Steven Kean said Wednesday. ""We have expressed some concerns about the utilities' creditworthiness,"" Kean said. ""They wouldn't have this credit issue if they had a government guarantee."" Standard & Poor's credit analyst for California utilities, Richard Cortright, told Dow Jones Newswires that such a guarantee is highly unlikely. ""There's no point in talking about it,"" Cortright said. The credit-rating agency put California utility holding companies PG&E Corp (PCG) and Edison International (EIX) on watch with negative implications Wednesday. The utilities have seen their debt rating downgraded already this fall, but their debts are piling up by the billions as they continue to pay about 10 times more for power supplies than they can charge customers. ""The sheer magnitute of the undercollected balance is beyond belief,"" Cortright said. ""Wholesale prices have gotten worse, and every hour the situation gets more dire."" Cortright said the only step that would save the utilities' credit status is if California regulators raised the rates the utilities can charge customers. Late Wednesday, the California Public Utilties Commission indicated that it may do so, reversing a decision",karen.denne@enron.com,"steven.kean@enron.com, mark.palmer@enron.com, richard.shapiro@enron.com,

"Power Situation by State By The Associated Press A state-by-state look at the electric power situation for summer: Alabama: Blackouts and rolling brownouts are unlikely as utilities are required to maintain a reserve 15 percent above what is needed to meet peak demand. Residential and business customers will pay rates about 1.1 percent above a year ago. Alaska: Blackouts and brownouts are unlikely. Hydroelectric power is plentiful, and generating systems are not being taxed. Electric bills are expected to fall slightly. Arizona: There is little likelihood of a power interruption. Utilities are prepared to handle the summer electricity demand, and price caps prevent the major utilities from increasing rates. Arkansas: Blackouts and rolling brownouts are highly unlikely. Electric bills are expected to rise 5 percent as increased fuel costs are passed on to customers and because the summer is expected to be even hotter than a year ago, when readings topped out at 111 degrees in Little Rock. California: Forecasts of tight power supplies throughout the West have energy experts in California warning of statewide rolling blackouts this summer. Power grid managers say concerted conservation efforts, accelerated construction of new power plants and ``a bit of luck'' could help avoid blackouts. Grid managers have already ordered rotating blackouts on four days since January. Los Angeles will most likely be spared because the L.A. Department of Water and Power provides its own generation and isn't connected with the state's grid. Colorado: The state is unlikely to experience blackouts or brownouts as",karen.denne@enron.com,"janel.guerrero@enron.com, james.steffes@enron.com, richard.shapiro@enron.com,

"fyi... editorial in today's LA Daily News: Lockyer lockdown Not wanting to be outdone by Gov. Gray Davis, California Attorney General Bill Lockyer recently tried his hand at Sacramento's new favorite game: demonizing power generators. Elaborating on his plan to file criminal charges against energy officials, Lockyer singled out Enron Corp. Chairman Kenneth Lay for imprudent remarks. ""I would love to personally escort Lay to an 8-by-10 cell,"" Lockyer told The Wall Street Journal, ""that he could share with a tattooed dude who says, 'Hi my name is Spike, honey.""' Get it? Spike would proceed to rape, maul and otherwise abuse Lay. Real funny, isn't it? Rape is widely considered commonplace in prison, and for good reason. Human Rights Watch estimates that as many 140,000 inmates have been raped in penitentiaries nationwide. In a recent study, the organization documented instances of sexual slavery taking place in prisons in six different states -- including California. That should be a serious concern for the state's top law-enforcement official -- not a laughing matter. Lockyer might have only been kidding, but his joke contains a tacit admission that rape is rampant in the state prison system. It suggests that he thinks this illegal and unconstitutional horror might, on occasion, serve as just punishment for some. Perhaps that's why prison officials -- in California and elsewhere -- have done so little to contain the problem.

Fat chance! And under deregulation, with production of electricity in independent hands, separated from the major utilities, there is a division of responsibility: When things go wrong, it is nearly impossible to assess whom to blame. So where do we go from here? Already, while ostensibly resisting re-regulation, utility officials are suggesting they need help. This is not surprising.

"The CEO meetings on Thursday went very well, and we had great turnout. Attached is a final list of who Ken met with and a list of who we invited. The takeaway from both meetings was to draft a letter outlining our five-point solution proposal, and the CEOs would be willing to sign it and send to the governor and legislators. Jeff and I drafted the letter and will finalize and send it to the CEOs on Monday. I also think we ought to consider placing full-page ads with the letter and enlisting some of the CEOs to attend editorial boards. At this point, it's important to keep Enron out of the picture.

California deregulation is a virus that will kill deregulation nationally. 3. The power shortage is a problem of our own making. 4. Californians must conserve power in record-setting levels. 5. The Governor and Legislator must level with citizens about the energy crisis 6. Utility rates must penalize consumption 7. Californians must unite to reign in generators 8. The Federal government should impose wholesale price caps 9.

"Davis Wants Generators to Accept Less Than Owed (Update2) 2/28/1 18:56 (New York) Davis Wants Generators to Accept Less Than Owed (Update2) (Adds names of California generators in fifth paragraph, and Reliant comment in sixth.) New York, Feb. 28 (Bloomberg) -- California Governor Gray Davis said he intends to ask power generators to accept partial payment for power sold to the state's cash-strapped utilities this summer and winter, Wall Street analysts who attended a closed-door meeting with the governor said. ``It looks like the people he wants sharing the pain are the companies generating power sold to utilities,'' said Kevin Boone, a bond analyst with Bear, Stearns & Co. who attended the meeting in New York. ``He wants to force them to take cents on the dollar. That seems to be what his initial proposal will be.'' PG&E Corp.'s Pacific Gas & Electric, and Edison International's Southern California Edison, the state's largest utilities, are near bankruptcy after accumulating more than $12 billion in debt buying power from generators at soaring prices. Regulators have not let the utilities pass on most of their power- buying debt to consumers. Davis said some generators have approached him with offers to accept less than full payment, said Michael Worms, a utility analyst with Gerard Klauer Mattison & Co. Davis spoke to about 35 analysts from Wall Street and energy-research firms in New York in a meeting that was criticized by investors and analysts who were not allowed to attend.
