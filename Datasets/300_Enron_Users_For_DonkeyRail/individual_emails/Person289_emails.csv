"Legal friends - Patrick and I met with Jason Williams and Veronica Espinoza today to talk, in part, about the flow of information from credit to legal to confirms regarding Credit Attachments. One area that I wanted to clarify with you folks is regarding the ""title"" of the Annexes. Sometimes we receive an Annex B/B-1 where, underneath the CP name, there is reference to a specific deal number. We attach it to the confirm, send it on its way, and we assume then that this Annex is deal specific. This causes confusion in our groups, because when subsequent deals are transacted with the same counterparty, credit advises us to use the previously provided Annex. However, when we go to attach what we believe to be the relevant Annex, we stop because it references another deal number. Jay and Veronica informed us that the Annexes should not be deal specific, just counterparty specific. So.....unless there is some other reason of which we are not aware, would you guys be able to discontinue putting specific deal numbers on the Credit attachments you create?

"Sizable staff of 245 lawyers in merger limbo HOUSTON (AP) - The fate of Enron Corp.'s massive legal staff has been a subject of discussion amid talk of possible layoffs at the troubled energy trader. The company's legal staff size is larger than some law firms. ""We've always regarded them as one of the big law firms in Houston,"" said Howard Ayers, managing partner of Andrews&Kurth, one of the city's largest with about 240 lawyers in Houston. Enron has about 245 lawyers worldwide, company spokesman Vance Meyer said. With about 145 lawyers in Houston, if it were a private firm it would have been the city's sixth-largest, according to the Chronicle. Enron's internal law office has grown along with the huge trading firm, now set to merge with smaller but stronger Dynegy. As Enron's stock plummeted further, Dynegy last week denied rumors it might drop out and leave Enron to face possible bankruptcy. Speculation in the legal community runs the gamut from rumors that dozens of lawyers could be laid off as early as this week to the idea that Enron will hold on tightly to its talent. ""My guess is they'll need their lawyers while they get things in a more steady state. There's a lot of legal work to go through,"" said Joel Swanson, a senior partner at Baker&Botts, a law firm with about 265 lawyers in Houston.

"Legal friends - Patrick and I met with Jason Williams and Veronica Espinoza today to talk, in part, about the flow of information from credit to legal to confirms regarding Credit Attachments. One area that I wanted to clarify with you folks is regarding the ""title"" of the Annexes. Sometimes we receive an Annex B/B-1 where, underneath the CP name, there is reference to a specific deal number. We attach it to the confirm, send it on its way, and we assume then that this Annex is deal specific. This causes confusion in our groups, because when subsequent deals are transacted with the same counterparty, credit advises us to use the previously provided Annex. However, when we go to attach what we believe to be the relevant Annex, we stop because it references another deal number. Jay and Veronica informed us that the Annexes should not be deal specific, just counterparty specific. So.....unless there is some other reason of which we are not aware, would you guys be able to discontinue putting specific deal numbers on the Credit attachments you create?

"Thanks. I know the lawyers are concerned about their fate. -----Original Message----- From: Anderson, Diane Sent: Tuesday, November 27, 2001 1:00 PM To: Bailey, Susan Subject: interesting Sizable staff of 245 lawyers in merger limbo HOUSTON (AP) - The fate of Enron Corp.'s massive legal staff has been a subject of discussion amid talk of possible layoffs at the troubled energy trader. The company's legal staff size is larger than some law firms. ""We've always regarded them as one of the big law firms in Houston,"" said Howard Ayers, managing partner of Andrews&Kurth, one of the city's largest with about 240 lawyers in Houston. Enron has about 245 lawyers worldwide, company spokesman Vance Meyer said. With about 145 lawyers in Houston, if it were a private firm it would have been the city's sixth-largest, according to the Chronicle. Enron's internal law office has grown along with the huge trading firm, now set to merge with smaller but stronger Dynegy. As Enron's stock plummeted further, Dynegy last week denied rumors it might drop out and leave Enron to face possible bankruptcy. Speculation in the legal community runs the gamut from rumors that dozens of lawyers could be laid off as early as this week to the idea that Enron will hold on tightly to its talent.

"Comments: 1. We should not have a threshold for these transactions - only KCS 2. Do we need to reference that the Master has been amended in the opening paragraph 3. Is there any way to reference the assignment to Brazos? I just want to make sure everyone understands that there are two outcomes for these deals on Jun 15: 1) Termination if VPP not done or 2) assignment of swap to Brazos if VPP is done. There should never be a time where ENA has a trades with KCS beyond Jun 15.
