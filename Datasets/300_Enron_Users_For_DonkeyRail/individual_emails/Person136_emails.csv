We think we would like to file a letter that may mention our general support of the ""direction"" of SoCal's changes, but that we do have an issue that has developed since actual implementation that we are currently working on with them. Lynn & I worked on this rough general description we thought could be incorporated into a brief letter. ""If SoCal calls an OFO in the Intraday 2 Cycle, an allocation is passed to Transwestern through the confirmation process with SoCal. Due to the timing of these OFO's, Transwestern is unable to confirm such reductions with Transwestern's upstream parties.""

"I would like to recap my understanding and the ""To Do's"" from the meeting yesterday. 1. After November 1, Measurement would NO longer adjust any TBS physical volumes unless there was a PPA directly influencing said TBS. 2. Measurement would check to see if they had a deduct meter they were using in the end user process. (Since the meeting we have discovered that the deduct meter IS in GVA, therefore no checking needs to be done). 3. Gas Logistics would check with IT on possible enhancement (if necessary) for negative volumes to the TBS. (We have talked with IT and this would be a major enhancement and have to be done with the new system). 4. Procedures need to be documented to handle negative numbers created by the LDC giving measurement an end user actual volume greater than the TBS connected to NNG. 5. Measurement and Gas Logistics agreed that all measured volumes including End User point volumes would be ""housed' in PGAS. After further discussions in Gas Logistics, our recommendation is that neither Measurement or Gas Logistics accomodate a negative number. If the LDC gives measurement an end user volume greater than the TBS the following should happen: 1. Measurement should either: a. Call the LDC and let them know they cannot accept a volume at an end user point higher than their TBS. b. Or Measurement can call Jodie Floyd on the Gas Logistics Measurement Desk and Jodie will call LDC with the same info. 2.

For printing Source Path and Allocation Path reports during the Allocation Process, the print function should be set at permanent default of legal and landscape. This would be a real time saver when checking the allocated points for uncalled for cuts. b. Customers would like to have subtotals by point and a grand total on the storage daily activity report (IDD/PNR Contract Balance). We now have the grouping to sum function, but I think this is too time consuming for our customers. c. In the Scheduled Quantities listings, instead of the box which now says ""No cuts were found in this cycle. Do you want to continue checking?"" I think the notice for Final AM should be expanded to say ""Did you submit new nominations for the Final AM Cycle? If not, please view Intraday 2 for any possible cuts."" Since so few of our customers actually use the Final AM Cycle, I think this would be helpful to our customers who are frequently",lynn.blair@enron.com,terry.kowalke@enron.com,"'Lynn Blair' : 'person', 'Janet McDaniel' : 'person', 'Maggie Matheson' : 'person', 'Lynn Blair' : 'person', 'John Buchanan' : 'person', 'Terry Kowalke' : 'person'",6,System enhancements,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,sent,lynn.blair@enron.com

"It was good to get your note. To answer your question, I had my last (hopefully) surgery last Monday, June 18th. Everything went well. I should be back to work on Tuesday, June 26th. I was surprised I did not get postponed with the flooding down in the Medical Center. I stayed over one night and I was sure ready to go home the next day. I really felt for those nurses. The hospital (Diagnostic Hospital) was full to capacity since they were helping out the Medthodist and Herman hospitals. Hope all your belongings in storage were OK. I am so glad ya'll did not have more damage than you did. I talked to Ricki yesterday and she has people starting to come in and redo the walls in her house this week. I am so glad you told me about Steve Klimesh's mom. I had not heard about that. Do you by chance have his address. I would like to send him a card. I had lunch with him right before he left and he was really looking forward to spending time with his Mom. Speaking of parents, how are yours? Hope they are both doing well.

"Ranelle, John and Michelle, thought I would send this statement to you and see if this helps simplify our answer to your question. The question is: How is MDQ used in the nomination system to ensure we do not double up on MDQ volumes when we have split paths (i.e. nom on same contract from (1) Mid 15 to Bushton Inlet and from (2) Bushton Outlet to Demac) For Nominating purposes: MDQ of contract = Primary Firm + Alternate Firm up to the MDQ. Anything over the MDQ will be Overrun and charged at the IT rate. Point MDQ needs to be considered when allocating a receipt point. EXAMPLE: If the Field MDQ is 10,000, then we will (1) total the reciepts nominated on the contract; (2) compare the total nominated to the Contract MDQ. Then the shipper will get firm (primary and alternate) up to their contract MDQ. Anything over will be overrun at IT rate. If anyone has any other questions, please let me know. Thanks.

Savings Plan. The amendment includes the following changes, which became effective on November 29: ? Savings Plan contributions that are deducted from your November 30 paycheck will be matched by Enron in cash rather than Enron stock. The cash match will be placed into the Fidelity Freedom 2000 fund, the default fund for the Plan. ? After November 30, Enron will no longer match your savings plan contributions. As an exception, the company will continue the union matching contributions to the Plan. ? The Savings Plan has always permitted employees to place their contributions in Enron stock or one or more alternative investment options. Effective immediately, diversification within the Plan will ALSO be allowed, regardless of your age, from COMPANY contribution accounts. This removes the restriction for all employees under the age of 50 to diversify the company contributions held in their account. These accounts include all prior company contributions, QNEC, and company match accounts.

"If the condition in OneOk's release tied to KN's settlement is ""simply unacceptable"" to ONeOk, then there is no deal unless we simultaneously receive the $$ from KN and OneOk and simultaneously sign the agreements. We will need to set up a closing type of event (not necessarily in one city, over the phone and fax is ok) and hold each other hostage until all the paper is signed and wire transfers received. Just in case she's curious, my position is we don't sign the release until the wire transfer is in our bank.
