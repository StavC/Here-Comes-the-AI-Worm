Here is a little information that could be of use in the future. BPA transmission and BPA Power Scheduling have informed us that scheduling this unit is a three part process: First you must call BPA(t) and set up the demand account. This should be done as early as possible. They do not like to set up this account at 23:30. Second you must also schedule the transmission on the use account. Third you must call BPA Power Scheduling and tell them to generate the power. This last step seems to have been overlooked. Power Scheduling's phone number is 503/230-3341. Secondary numbers are 503/230-4194 and 503/230-3150. Please call BPA transmission or BPA Power Scheduling if you have any questions.

Available for delivery in Houston and Dallas, the product is offered by Enron in the over-the-counter market and via Clickpaper.com, Enron's Internet-based transaction system dedicated to the forest products industry. The first transaction was completed via Clickpaper.com on March 14 with a major lumber buyer in the southern United States. This represents the first online fixed price transaction contract in the industry. With the growing volatility in the lumber industry, the availability of a long-term fixed price product provides companies with another opportunity to mitigate their exposure. Additionally, this transaction represents the convergence of Enron's increasing involvement in physical lumber transactions with our recognized expertise in financial risk management. In addition, EIM has announced that it has completed its acquisition of the Quebec City, Canada newsprint mill and related assets from Daishowa Forest Products Ltd. In July 2000, Enron purchased Garden State Paper, a recycled newsprint mill located in Garfield, NJ. The acquisition of the Daishowa mill now positions Enron as the seventh largest producer of newsprint",holden.salisbury@enron.com,salisbury@spiretech.com,"'Holden Salisbury' : 'person', 'Garfield, NJ' : 'address'",2,EnTouch Newsletter,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,sent,holden.salisbury@enron.com

Subject: DSTAR Update - 2 - IMPORTANT Importance: High Jim, In speaking with Ron Moulton of WAPA (Phoenix office) I have gathered the following information: Signatories to MOU for WesTrans for-profit transco are, currently: SRP, APS, PNM, TEPCo, El Paso. Pending, Texas/New Mexico, awaiting authority from their management. There are no Colorado entities signed on, Excel Energy, which owns PSCO will most likely be an ITC and operate under one of the RTOs. The Filing Utilties are meeting TODAY (10/4) with all four FERC Commissioners and FERC staff for a pre-filing briefing. It is Ron's opinion that it is the intention of the filing utilities to position themselves as THE RTO for the west. They feel that the first in to FERC has the best chance to form opinion and policy. WAPA has not yet signed due to what they feel as a responsibility to their customers to complete cost-justification and environmental impact studies.

Tom did the deal with Pinwest our buy for $40, and I did the deal with DYPMI our sale at Index. I told the SW guys about this the following day, and in the mayhem, the deals probably did not get put in.
