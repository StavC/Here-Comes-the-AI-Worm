He has worded the Keep Whole on his deal tickets as follows: ""Volumes deliverd in excess of 10% of the FOM nom shall be prived at the applicable Gas Daily Report, Midpoint price. Volumes delivered below 10% of the FOM nom shall be kept whole at the applicable Gas Daily Mid-point up to the agreed tolerance level of 10%.""
