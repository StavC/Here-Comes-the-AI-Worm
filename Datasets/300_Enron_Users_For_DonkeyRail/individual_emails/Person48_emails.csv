Here's the proposal we discussed, which comes to $200/month. Normally we insist on a minimum of $1,000/month, but I feel there are many bigger things we can collaborate on down the road. I haven't included pricing for the satellite and radar imagery because it's more costly (I have fixed royalties that I have to pay on that) and because of the complexity of having to track the number of users of Canadian radar. On the North American satellite imagery, the cost would be $490/month on open access and $380/month for restricted access, no limits on the number of users. For Canadian radar, it's available as a restricted-access-only package of three regional shots and a national image for $1,000/month minimum for the first 500 users, then $2/month/user for 501-1000 users, then $1.50 for users 1001-2500, $1 for users 2501-5000 and 75 cents/user thereafter.

I haven't included pricing for the satellite and radar imagery because it's more costly (I have fixed royalties that I have to pay on that) and because of the complexity of having to track the number of users of Canadian radar. On the North American satellite imagery, the cost would be $490/month on open access and $380/month for restricted access, no limits on the number of users. For Canadian radar, it's available as a restricted-access-only package of three regional shots and a national image for $1,000/month minimum for the first 500 users, then $2/month/user for 501-1000 users, then $1.50 for users 1001-2500, $1 for users 2501-5000 and 75 cents/user thereafter.

If you wish to discuss those further, perhaps we can schedule a time on the phone. Preamble: We are a Delaware corporation. Section 1: Definition: the attrition rate per your definition is diluted by the addition of new clients. The attrition rate should calculated based on the number of existing clients at the beginning of the agreement without taking new clients into account. Section 3: Termination of the Agreement should be mutual, and we cannot agree to keeping the Exclusivity at the same level through any renewal periods. Section 5: the definition of competitors is too broad. We would like to see something that more tightly defines electronic trading of wholesale commodities. We would like to retain the ability to offer these services in areas where Enron Online is not active, such as supply chain systems, and in the retail markets for large commercial and industrial concerns. Also, I am not sure whether this is intended, but your reference to ""any Publication"" will give you exclusivity to ALL our publications for the fee set out in 4 a. That is not the intent. Section 6 (b) should be removed (see comments on Section 1) Section 10. we cannot agree to letting En",dave.samuels@enron.com,"jason.peters@enron.com, mark.taylor@enron.com","'Dave Samuels' : 'person', 'Abudi Zein' : 'person', 'David A.

Here's the proposal we discussed, which comes to $200/month. Normally we insist on a minimum of $1,000/month, but I feel there are many bigger things we can collaborate on down the road. I haven't included pricing for the satellite and radar imagery because it's more costly (I have fixed royalties that I have to pay on that) and because of the complexity of having to track the number of users of Canadian radar. On the North American satellite imagery, the cost would be $490/month on open access and $380/month for restricted access, no limits on the number of users. For Canadian radar, it's available as a restricted-access-only package of three regional shots and a national image for $1,000/month minimum for the first 500 users, then $2/month/user for 501-1000 users, then $1.50 for users",dave.samuels@enron.com,mark.taylor@enron.com,"'Mark' : 'person', 'Dave Samuels' : 'person', 'Dave Samuels' : 'person', 'Dave.Samuels@enron.com' : 'email', 'Nick Mooney' : 'person', 'Nick.Mooney@enron.com' : 'email', 'Paul Goddard' : 'person', 'Paul.Goddard@enron.com' : 'email'",8,Weather Graphics Proposal,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,sent,dave.samuels@enron.com

"Dave: As I mentioned yesterday, I have made a few more revisions to the Legal & Privacy statement to respond to a couple of issues raised by Justin Boyd. The final version is attached. I was unable to run a red-line of this document, so I have summarized the revisions below: 1. Section 2, second sentence: replaced the word ""derivatives"" with ""derivations"". 2. Section 4: revised in its entirety. 3. Section 9, first sentence: added ""all or"" before the words ""any part of the website"" in the third/fourth line and replaced the word ""the"" with ""this"" before the words ""Legal and Privacy statement"" at the end of the sentence. 4. Section 11(a): capitlized ""Information"" 5. Section 13: revised the reference to ""this paragraph 6"" to refer to ""the paragraph 13"" 5. Note that I added the new Section 17 at the bottom relating to T1 access. Please let me know if you have any questions or comments.
