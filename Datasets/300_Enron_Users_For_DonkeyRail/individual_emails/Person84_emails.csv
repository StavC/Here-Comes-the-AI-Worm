EPSA is very active in making filings at FERC, taking the same position as Enron in many filings. Sometimes we like to have EPSA file, then Enron may not need to file. In some cases, EPSA cannot file (for example, when the members cannot agree), then Enron would file if it is an important issue to us. For this call, Ray, you may want to be on the call since EPSA is going to file re: Cal. order. Susan--Sarah Novosel will probably be on the call for the NY issue and Tom Hoatson is attending the workshop on capacity. Therefore, typically, you wouldn't need to be on this call, but I think you should listen in to learn. (I will get you on the EPSA distribution.)

If the service territory is singly certified to RUSK, then no alternative counter party is eligible to supply power to the Enron contract. However, if the territory is dually certified to SWEPCO, then SWEPCO could be an alternative counter party for the Enron contract instead of RUSK.

If I'm not mistaken you're actually in Australia right now doing all kinds of fun and active things, so you probably won't get this for a few days. I can't tell you how glad I am that you've had a chance to take advantage of all the travel possibilities on that side of the world ( and not just a little jealous). I think all of these experiences are going to leave you with some incredible memories of your time in South Korea. As for myself, this weekend will mark only the second in the last month and a half or so that I will be spending in Houston. I figured by now I'd be traveled out but I can't get enough. The Caymans were incredible...we ate at great restaurants (not Bed unfortunately, but I did see it), got to go scuba diving off the east end and swam with a slew of stingrays. Actually, I was holding onto/bonding with one of the stingrays, just floating with the current, for about 5 minutes until I had to gently shove it off and swim back into safe proximity of the boat. It was a completely surreal experience. Plus, the trip solidified my appreciation and fondness for the new job, and more specifically the new co-workers, which is never a bad thing.

"Hey Susan, I think my brother and his wife might be at Laura Jahnke's wedding as well - you might say hello. School starts in 1 1/2 weeks. I am really excited about starting. I should learn at ton, and get exposed to all sorts of things which will be helpful in the coming years. My parents are driving up today to help me move into my new place, closer to school(my parents are awesome!). Rx-Saver.com is nearing completion. Hopefully, we will open for business in a few weeks. Starting a business has been more of a challenge than i expected. Just when things get rolling, a challenge raises its ugly little head. But, I love it. It is alot more fun than a 9-5 job, and there is alot more potential to hit a homerun. Anyways, I hope life is going great! Say hello to Allan and Lisa for me.

FERC rules allow monopoly pipeline companies to market natural gas in competitive markets providing they adopt codes of conduct that prevent the passing of information that provides a competitive advantage to their gas-marketing affiliates.
