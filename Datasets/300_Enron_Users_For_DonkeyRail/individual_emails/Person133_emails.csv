"I would like to clear up a confusing situation with Ameren which is currently taking place: On 8/29, Ameren Service Company (""ASC"") they asked us to take them off EOL, apparently because they now want to trade in EOL under the name ""Ameren Energy Inc. as agent"". On 8/29, Legal said OK to taking ASC off EOL and said further that AEI's approval to trade on EOL was ""on-hold"" until Legal checked out the agency aspect. Despite this - AEI appears to have been trading on EOL since 8/16 and the confirmations we have been receiving back have been marked up by them. They are trying to change the name on the confirmations to AEI acting as agent for various entities. I instructed Stephanie Sever yesterday to make sure that AEI either acting for itself OR acting as agent does not have access to EOL. This needs to stay the case until Legal directs otherwise. Just so everyone is aware, Leslie Hansen spoke with Ameren several weeks ago and told them that they would need to sign a special Consent Form as well as a modified ETA before AEI could act as an agent on EOL. The forms were emailed to them on 8/22 and to my knowledge, they have not been returned to us. I have left messages for the Ameren's attorney to call me but she has not done so yet. In any case, until they return the requested documents, they cannot trade on EOL.

I previously spoke with Lisa Groff/Frank Hilton, my credit people participating on this subcommittee, and we agreed that it was preferable to have the credit managers and those on this mini-drafting group complete their assignment of crafting a provision for the larger drafting committee of the EEI contract to subsequently review. The larger drafting committee would review to ensure that the language, phrasing and structure of the document is consistent with the existing EEI contract, and also have the larger group's credit personnel involved in reviewing the subcommittee's work. As a result, I have not tried to redline at this juncture, because the smaller drafting committee has not finished its work and created a consensus document. I agree that the timing at year end of this effort is really squeezing our resources.

Since online credit derivatives are not traded under our existing master agreements, we need to make clear to the Credit Group that these positions should not be included when they determine their rights to call for collateral under the masters. I'm not familiar with the fraud limitation towards the end of Section 6. Is this particular to credit derivatives? With respect to the third paragraph of Section 9, we need to be aware that these GTC's can be accepted by any EOL user while the ETA must be accepted by the Mater User. It is not entirely clear that all sub-users will have the authority to amend the ETA. Is the purpose of the second sentence to ""deactivate"" master agreements that might otherwise control the transaction? If so, in other circumstances where we needed to force the GTC to override a master, we have taken additional steps to notify the affected counterparties. (I can't remember if we required that the counterparty execute a side letter or if we just notified them that acceptance of the GTC would acknowledge that the master did not control.)

"I just spoke with Steve Doss and explained how to get a power marketer certificate at FERC (and EWG filing if necessary depending on who West Linn's partner is for plant ownership) and the 60 day (generally) time required (Although I think that FERC would be inclined to wave the 60 days based on the supply shortage in the West). I also explained that EPMI is making a filing this week at FERC that would allow EPMI to provide some FERC filing services on behalf of industrial customers in order to facilitate their sales to the grid (when approved, hopefully in about 60 days). He said that West Linn has not built the 2 cogens yet (43 MWs each of which West Linn would use appr. 17 MWs/hour), but that it is interested in setting up its licenses before the start of retail access on 10/1/01 in Oregon. (An item to think about--I don't know anything about the Oregon retail program or current rate structure with PGE, but generally the lack of retail open access will not prevent an industrial on site generator from selling to the grid, unless its host utility rate schedule precludes it from doing so). I am sending him a FERC order issued last year dealing with industrials selling to the grid (InPower order), plus will send him the EPMI filing when we make it later this week.

"Per our conversation with Dan F., ENA needs to understand issues related to the distinction between ""investor owned utilities"" (or ""IOUs"") and municipal utilities (or ""municipals"") in connection with derivatives activity. In the U.S., this distinction enables us to treat IOUs as general corporates. Thus, we negotiate our standard ISDA Master with an IOU, except that we add an Additional Termination Event to prevent the IOU from taking an adverse stance in its state public utility commission proceedings. A copy of that Additional Termination Event is attached for your review. Our approach with respect to municipals is dramatically different. When negotiating an ISDA Master with municipals, we use a Schedule modeled after the 1992 U.S. Municipal Counterparty Schedule, having additional reps, the added concept of ""Incipient Illegality"" and an enforceability opinion. A copy of that Schedule is also attached for your reference. We would like to understand whether this distinction also exists in Canada, and if so, in all Canadian provinces, and whether there is a distinction when a municipal is an investor in an IOU (as we understand that the government may assist a utility to emerge from bankruptcy).

"I just had this conv. w/Mark and Marcus Nettleton today about parties acting as agent, or in some fiduciary capacity online. What I am being told is that the system is set up for parties to only act as principals for online trading. It does not deal with agent, fiduciary or similar relationships. The only exception to this rule so far has been GPU where they had an agency relationship with 3 utilities, on the power side, where Leslie had some specific documentation that she got signed. But I am told should not be entering into transactions with counterparties as anything other than principals, except under extraordinary circumstances.

The subsidiary will be receiving dollars under a bond issue and paying pounds out (a spot transaction I believe) but will then receive pounds income which it will need to convert to dollars to pay interest on the bonds. The precedent document is the Sutton Bridge currency swap. Can you please confirm you have been instructed and let us know your timing for issuing a document. The sooner we can see this next week the better. The bond trustee will as usual require the swap to be backed with legal opinions from Enron in-house counsel (Mark Haedicke) re due execution and from V&E (Terry Yates) re enforceability. My understanding is that the swap will not be guaranteed by Corp (correct Julian?).
