"We have scheduled a user test for Clickpaper on Saturday, July 22nd starting at 8:30 AM on the 29th floor of the Enron building. First, a reminder to Edward and Bob to make sure the ENA Paper group is here (commercial only plus, at a minimum, John Jacobson). It is up to Edward and Bob to decide if London personnel should be here but I would recommend a few. They will be the ""users"" in the test. We will have a script for them. The goal is to test the site and the capability of the trading floor. I will explain more about this to Edward and Bob next week. Also, Bill Bradford or his designee from credit needs to be here to review the functionality of the credit check. Also, Ted Murphy or his designee needs to be here to review control. If the test is a success, we will wipe the system clean Saturday and will create actual customer profiles we have received in the system on Sunday. Monday we will review everything one last time for Tuesday launch, July 25th launch. We will provide lunch for everyone so get to me the names of who is committed so I can plan.

In that case I have a couple of thoughts 1). I have no problem with an internal launch of this. If external, I have a very big problem. 2). I think it would be better for the relationship between ETS and ENW had you informed us of your intention to do this. You are using the EnronOnline brand and whether that is internal or external it is ours to manage. as this was a complete surprise to us. It doesn't really seem like just a pipeline risk management product. 3). Because this was not part of our development and operations effort, we cannot support the product technically. There will be no change management. Given the amount of changes we do to our back end there is a high likelihood that in the future your product will cease to function 4).

"A near term goal for mid/back office commercialization is as follows: First, we need to determine what each piece is in the mid/back office that can be commercialized and how we would separate these different pieces. In other words, how we separate risk reporting and general ledger and where we put it at Enron. How we put the physical gas nominations and power scheduling at the desks. How we take the rest for gas and power (and/or financial) and create ProcessCo/ServiceCo as a separate entity or within Net Works. Second, once we know the different pieces, can we separate them from a systems perspective ( I am assuming that separating people is straightforward)? Third, assuming we can separate things, how we communicate back to the other parts. In other words, how we communicate information back to Enron's SAP system, how we settle for Enron if they want ProcessCo to do physical settlements, how we receive information so we can deal capture and confirm, etc. All the linkages. Fourth, how we create an agreement between ProcessCo and EWS that defines payments, service levels, term, etc. that can be a model for other companies as well. Fifth, how this all deals with CommodityLogic and its business model. Sixth, if we go alone or work with someone like Arcordia (after Beth's meeting).

My understanding is that a software product provided by Ariba Inc. is used to support/power Clickpaper.com. I was previously asked to review the Ariba software license in relation to Clickpaper.com's ability to establish ""regional"" Clickpaper.com systems.

"Clickpaper is now on the web with transactable prices. At 8:30 AM Tuesday the 25th, we did our first trade, a 42# linerboard trade (the outside part of a cardboard box) with Con Agra (13,500 tons and about $6,000,000 notional). We hope to do another trade today with Irving as well. I am sure we will have a new list of bugs at the end of today but I think we are past the major issues. Going forward (next two to three weeks), we will be working to get the product offering from its current 21 financial to about 50 financial as well as adding in physical at Rotterdam. We will also be ready to handle any newsprint from Garden State at the end of August. We also have some text changes and minor programming related to wording on the site that is new or unclear to the industry. We will continue to push for registration (currently at 12 who now have user ID, password and made it through credit, legal, tax). The markets load in about 4 seconds now so we fixed the slowness issue. We will also start generating a report each day on stats that are relevant. I will try to get some read only IDs for people but give me a little time to get this done.

"FYI GP -----Original Message----- From: Zipper, Andy Sent: Monday, June 04, 2001 11:39 AM To: Sherriff, John Subject: RE: EnronOnline Real-Time Quotes Service on Reuters John, We are sending our bid and offer prices to Reuters for most US Gas & Power products, as well as European Gas and Power, Crude and Refined products, Bandwidth, Coal, Emissions, Weather and Sea Freight. We will receive 75% of all revenue Reuters collects from subscriptions to EnronOnline quotes. It is an evergreen 1 yr contract with mutual termination rights upon 90 days prior notice. We are under no obligations to provide levels of service. Revenue expectations: Reuters will charge, initially, $150/month/desktop. They have 5,000 Energy desktops worldwide. thus with 100% penetration we would get 5,000 x 150 x 12 x .75= $6,750,000; With a more realistic assumption of 50% penetration the yield to Enron would be $3,375,000 p.a. This revenue does not include the incremental benefits, in our view, of branding and standardization of our product and liquidity in the marketplace.

"Did you talk to Dynegy about buying the engine behind EnronOnline? I know Andy is going to work for Arnold in the next 4 to 6 weeks, but he is getting a team geared up around selling some EnronOnline licenses to various markets like Agriculture, crude/petchems, energy, etc. We would not support software behind someone else's firewall, but these would be dedicated environments we set up and license and possibly support (what you and I talked about last week). We have some traction with some companies like Dow and GM on an application license as well as renting them a row or rows on EnronOnline, but those sales have some cultural issues associated with them as well. I think you and I could actually originate some license deals on our own with Dynegy, Calpine, Duke and El Paso. I briefly brought it up with Posoli (in addition to mid/back office outsourcing which we will pitch to him the first week in June) and he said he doesn't want to create CalpineOnline.com, but he said that just being able to wire together his gas and power traders on the back end would be great. Clearly, Lavo needs to agree that he is comfortable with others in this space having these tools.

This is to allow non-registered EOL users to contact their AE and have their credit checked by EOL during transaction process. The system would know then not to check for ETA, GTC etc, etc. We would then load these internal counterparty types into the ""Internal BrokerClient"" for use by AE's. 2). This counterparty type will be flagged to execute at submitted price as opposed to better of submitted or available.

"A near term goal for mid/back office commercialization is as follows: First, we need to determine what each piece is in the mid/back office that can be commercialized and how we would separate these different pieces. In other words, how we separate risk reporting and general ledger and where we put it at Enron. How we put the physical gas nominations and power scheduling at the desks. How we take the rest for gas and power (and/or financial) and create ProcessCo/ServiceCo as a separate entity or within Net Works. Second, once we know the different pieces, can we separate them from a systems perspective ( I am assuming that separating people is straightforward)? Third, assuming we can separate things, how we communicate back to the other parts. In other words, how we communicate information back to Enron's SAP system, how we settle for Enron if they want ProcessCo to do physical settlements, how we receive information so we can deal capture and confirm, etc. All the linkages. Fourth, how we create an agreement between ProcessCo and EWS that defines payments, service levels, term, etc. that can be a model for other companies as well. Fifth, how this all deals with CommodityLogic and its business model. Sixth, if we go alone or work with someone like Arcordia (after Beth's meeting).

"FYI I will be out of the office on Wednesday, March 28. I will be in Austin interviewing 1st year MBA students for the Enron Scholarships. This will be the third year that Enron will give two to three $10,000 scholarships to top MBA students for use in their second year in business school. It's great PR for Enron on campus (largest MBA scholarships given) and it has helped in our recruiting efforts as well. We hired one of the first scholarship winners and he now works as an Associate in Generation Investments in Enron Americas. Gene Humphrey was the senior member of the four-person interview team.

"Peter Mims is preparing a memo to me that will confirm our findings on the IP issues based on the contracts we have reviewed and the meeting we had yesterday. I should get a copy of it today and will circulate it once it is finalized. I will also prepare a list of the contracts we have reviewed. I am still collecting a few agreements (Ganady Batrak's prior service agreement and Bob Campbells agreement) and will also be collecting copies of our agreements with Enron Net Works employees for review. With respect to the NDA's, they have all been drafted and it is my understanding that they were sent to our counterparties last week. Oracle has already signed an NDA and I have a copy if you would like to have it. I would suggest that before we have further conversations with Oracle that we consider asking them to also sign a non-solicitation agreement with us. The NDA with Oracle is the only NDA that does not contain a non-solicitation provision. In order to facilitate getting the rest of NDA's signed as quickly as possible, I would suggest that Rex ask each of his contacts for the name and phone number of the legal counsel reviewing the agreement and I will give them a call and find out if they have any issues that need to be resolved.

"Greg, a couple of other thoughts and ideas for Monday's meeting. I would like to discuss the entire process chain as part of the timelines, personnel responsibilities and key action items. I think this is another good way to find any potential gaps and help prioritize various items and assignments. Andrew Parsons Sr. Director (and superior performer) is a great and very smart guy that can add a lot of value to the effort. You will like him and he will be a very valuable resource to add to the team - even if it is for a couple of weeks. He wrote the IT compliance process chain and could reverse engineer difficult parts that are unique to the Ariba platform. He has others on his team that could help and I've asked him to think about his existing AA resources that are available (some are working on ClickPaper already). Other resources that have been identified to potential added firepower in the short run: Beth Pearlman, John Tollefson (IT), Bob Schultz (LK said she could spare him without delaying phase 2 roll out), Dave Forester (not a good option because it would definitely set back phase 2 roll out), Mary Solmenson, Scott Mills, Berry Pearce, David Port, David Sweeny, Sally Beck (advice and discuss additional resources). I did ask Louise to jump in (and i know you did too) to help on some quick thoughts on process and lessons learned.

"Rahil will have a draft to me this afternoon, then he, Beth Apollo and I will meet tomorrow morning at 8:30 to discuss and revise. I don't want to ""mass mail"" this on Friday. (None of these guys will read it on Friday afternoon or over the weekend anyway.) Instead, I want to meet with Frank Vickers and Ed Baughman (I have known both for years and we get both gas and power covered) either Friday afternoon or Monday to go over the presentation in person and get their thoughts and input (Rahil included).

"FYI - People tend to forget that we have some parts of the business that run 24 hours a day.

The voicemail gives the caller contact info. (page & home #'s). In addition if they hit zero it will be forwarded to our off-hours dispatching service. The dispatching service has current contact information for every pipe we do business on. The schedulers were also instructed to call out to their key counterparties and make sure they have page, home and cell #'s.

I am confident we can get it done even though it will be a fire drill. We had a control or process matrix meeting today and it is all there, it was just being held or managed in four places. It will all be pulled together by Monday in one place (one complete document) and will have about 15 major categories with specific tasks under each category with status, person responsible, comments and date to be completed. It will also have a complete timeline. We can review that Monday and agree on its content. Louise agreed to review it as well. As it relates to the people you mentioned, let me know how and/or who you want to pull in after we agree on the control document. That way we will know which areas I have holes and how we can fill them. Salley Beck called (she mentioned you had called her as well) and we agreed that the ClickPaper's back office representative would officially be Scott Earnest (he has been unofficially it for months and we have been working with him for months).

At this meeting we will briefly review the results from numerous smaller PRC meetings that will have been held by my team during the week of June 4. On June 11, we will give a cursory review to the results from the smaller PRC meetings from analysts through manager. Our primary goal will be to make sure that the appropriate distribution has been met, and that we are aware of the individuals that are 1's and 5's. The main focus of the meeting will be to cross calibrate directors, senior directors and VP's across the operations organization and the teams that support EA, EGM and EIM.

On Thursday, we discussed with Kathryn Cordes and the ConfirmLogic IT team the items that we had found that were ""show stoppers"" as far as releasing the product for Beta Testing. Some of the major Items found were the inability to properly handle Basis Swaps for Gas and inability to display meaningful Index References for Power (they were pulling in a code rather than a description of the Index). The team worked on the ""fixes"" and migrated the code last night. Today during testing, they found that the new code had actually caused problems with the fixed price and volume information, which was working previously. I talked to Kathryn and she said that the were rebuilding the code. She said that someone had tested the fix last night and everything worked fine. We plan more testing in the morning.

"Greg -- No word from C1 yet, which is strange. I will give Mark Hoffman a call this week if I do not hear from Matt Graves soon. I talked with Bill Popp of Sungard yesterday. Bill is trying to gather up the appropriate Sungard folks for a meeting. The bad news is that Sungard's going-in posture is for a royalities-only approach, much like everyone else has tried initially. Obviously, this is preliminary, and we will have the opportunity to influence this. Sungard is much more comfortable with their core business of processing transactions rather than that of selling front-end applications. This bias makes them cautious in approaching the Offline opportunity. Clearly, we need to get them in for a detailed demo -- their knowledge of Offline is still very sketchy. We are dealing with the trading and risk systems group in Sungard. We also have a corporate-level sponsor in Ron Lang. I will ask Mark Palmer if he can get us more info on overall corporate structure.
