"Is it really so you can look at girls or so people can look at you? I think your right about everyone being able to beat anyone with one important caveat.

Of course if one is patient and bides their time they could probably stand a shot when the guy gets really old and slow. Also, are you so bold as to suggest you've never lost?

"The Commercial Group asked several weeks ago whether they can enter into discount letters applicable to daily firm for as long as one year. The standard wording of the discount letter applicable to daily firm is such that the discount is effective for as many one-day terms as the FTS-1 agreement renews, but not beyond a specified date. Typically TW enters into these discount letters for a term of one month. The marketers say that they were once told that they could not make such a discount applicable for longer than a 3-month term. I see no basis for this limitation. The term of the FTS-1 agreement is one day, renewable from day to day. The discount is only applicable for so long as the FTS-1 agreement renews. If the FTS-1 agreement does not renew, the discount is no longer applicable. The basis for the shipper's transportation rights is the FTS-1 agreement. We are not guaranteeing a shipper ""daily"" firm for longer than a one-day term. The discount letter merely states that, for so long as the FTS-1 agreement renews, a particular discount applies, up to a certain cutoff date. Does this make sense?

"Transwestern held its Transport Options Workshop on August 31. Commercial and regulatory representatives of BP-Amoco, Burlington, Conoco, Coral, Dynegy, Phillips and Reliant attended. After a brief overview of the proposed filing, TW opened the floor for questions and comments. Here is a summary of the comments. Marketing affiliate concerns. BP's regulatory representative expressed concern that TW's marketing affiliates would be able to use options to game the system. In BP's example, since TW and ENA are both Enron companies, ENA could purchase an ""out of the money"" call option essentially cost free, since its affiliate (TW) would have the ability to buy the option back. Proceeds from ENA's ability to then ""move the market"" through the establishment of the long basis position would go directly to Enron's bottom line. BP suggested that TW's marketing affiliates be banned from purchasing options, or that the marketing affiliate be required to credit 100% of the option proceeds to other shippers. Although BP admits that Transwestern's prior dealings with ENA have not been suspect, BP fears that TW's filing will set a precedent for other pipelines to offer a similar service. Since TW will be the first pipeline to offer such services, BP wants TW's program to be as restricted as possible. Dynegy echoed BP's concern regarding possible affiliate abuse, but rather than shelve the program entirely, Dynegy reiterated an earlier suggestion that Transwestern be required to credit back the difference between the option fee paid by",susan.scott@enron.com,"danny.mccarty@enron.com, mary.miller@enron.com, glen.hass@enron.com,

"I'm soooo good. The chosen path was cool, indifference. So, last night was Steak Night and with Nick and Wilson both in town we had a really good showing. I got there about 7:30 with Nick, and the group's size swelled to about 12+ by 8:30 - 9:00. About 8:00 I saw Kevin (Ted's pal - the one you meet a steak night) wandering around LW's obviously in search of someone. Can you believe it? He (Ted) knew I had organized this gathering - I know that because Nick is working right across from he and Darren and overheard Darren encouraging Ted's attendance (mind you Ted was not in the email distribution) - and he had the nerve to come. Anyway, Kevin saw me and came over to chat. He informed me that ""our friend Ted should be there shortly"" to which I responded, ""You would know better than me at this point"". The subject was dropped until he felt the need to raise it again. He asked if Ted and I parted on good terms/ bad terms, etc. I said there really weren't any terms, I just hadn't heard a peep out of him for about 2 weeks.

"Mary Kay and Drew, please see Christine's message below. This language is very similar to language that NNG has used to address the change-in-rates issue. I do not believe it creates a negotiated rates issue. Please let me know as soon as possible if you have any concerns. It is important that we work something out with Phillips today. By the way, I asked Christine if she had asked Phillips to 1) give up their right of first refusal and 2) agree to our new capacity release language (i.e. TW gets the upside if capacity is released at a higher rate) in exchange for us making this compromise.

Commission staff denied the blanket request, but indicated that Maritimes could request that specific provisions be kept confidential. Maritimes subsequently requested that the contract terms and various cut-off dates [FN29] in the precedent agreements be kept confidential because such information was commercially sensitive. On the other hand, Maritimes requested that the terms and conditions of the backstop agreements be kept confidential, but was willing to make the contract terms of 10 and 20 years public. Generally, the Commission will deny blanket requests for confidentiality of agreements that are submitted to demonstrate market support for new facilities.

The only case that even addressed the issue of confidentiality of contracts in a certificate context was one I'll excerpt here: ** In Maritimes & Northeast Pipeline, L.L.C., 80 FERC P 61,346 (1997), Maritimes requested confidentiality for the precedent agreements it submitted. Commission staff denied the blanket request, but indicated that Maritimes could request that specific provisions be kept confidential. Maritimes subsequently requested that the contract terms and various cut-off dates [FN29] in the precedent agreements be kept confidential because such information was commercially sensitive. On the other hand, Maritimes requested that the terms and conditions of the backstop agreements be kept confidential, but was willing to make the contract terms of 10 and 20 years public. Generally, the Commission will deny blanket requests for confidentiality of agreements that are submitted to demonstrate market support for new facilities. [FN30] However, in the instance case, the contract terms of the backstop agreements are public and, thus, evidence of longterm subscriptions for Maritimes proposal are in the public record",drew.fossum@enron.com,susan.scott@enron.com,"'Susan Scott' : 'person', 'Drew Fossum' : 'person', 'sstojic@gbmdc.com' : 'email', 'fkelly@gbmdc.com' : 'email'",4,Re: Gallup request for rehearing,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,received,susan.scott@enron.com

Jeff, Lorraine and I just learned that this is not the case. Our ""generally available"" posting system does not distinguish between capacity rolling off of a contract and capacity that is subject to a ROFR; all it recognizes is the expiration of the initial contract term. Therefore, we have capacity posted on our website that is subject to the current shipper's ROFR and that is therefore not really available. We found this out when a shipper called asking about some posted space. Jeff's initial reaction was ""no, that space isn't available."" But when we checked the posting, there it was.
