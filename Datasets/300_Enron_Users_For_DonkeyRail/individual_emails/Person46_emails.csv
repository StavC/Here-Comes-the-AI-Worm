"College Station, TX (AP) - R.C. Slocum and the Texas A&M Aggies are demanding a recount of the game in which Oklahoma won 35 to 31. ""The end zones were confusing,"" says Slocum. ""I'm sure that some of the touchdowns that went in Oklahoma's end zone were meant to go into ours. We were scoring in those end zones also. Oklahoma would never have scored thirty-five points. There's no way we lost this one. A&M demands a recount."" Oklahoma officials are calling this ""outrageous"". ""They agreed to the size, shape and locations of the end zones prior to kick-off,"" replies OU coach Bob Stoops. ""If they had a problem with them, they should have said so before we started. You don't get to keep playing until you're happy with the outcome. Someone had to lose. We've scored over thirty-five points many times."" A&M has sent lawyers, farmers, and those guys in the funny boots as well as that darn dog down to Kyle Field, where the scoreboard will be tested. ""We are confident that when the points are re-totaled, we will be the winner of the game,"" says Slocum. OU also points out that in many games prior to this one, the same end zones were used.

"All fixed priced deals (esp. Calpine) have their risk assigned to the Price Book.

This keeps things normal in our worlds and Pam controls when she sees the P&L on her company. She has agreed to do this. There will be a new twist starting in July. Starr is supposed to become 3rd party and the payment date is supposedly two months after the fact.

Generally, we have a few minor questions relating to the Comstock/Sun deals (do improper prior bookings account for the difference between the purchase price in some cases - ie. $2.477 vs. 2.508?) and certain deals do not appear to be wellhead related (Western Gas 500752 & 507804 and Pan Energy 500560). The dollar amount involved are quite minor. I believe, on a going forward basis, the large Coastal negative number ($92,233) will disappear beginning on 4/1/2000. As we discussed, would you therefore provide us with your wellhead accrual income data for April, 2000 so we can see the net effect of correcting the Coastal booking? Thanks.

"David, Here is a short list of what it takes to pull positions into the benchmark. 1) Once a book is officialized it must be loaded into GRMS BEFORE the positions can be pulled into the benchmark. 2) With everyone officializing books around the same time the GRMS que is overloaded and positions are very slow to be loaded into GRMS. 3) GRMS processes books in the order that they are officialized. If one of your books is officialized behind either the Nymex, Power, or Canadian books your book will not be loaded into GRMS until these books are finished. This process can take up to 45 minutes to complete. 4) I have to manually create text files for deals that they system is not designed to handle. These files must then be loaded into GRMS. 4) I have to manually override Post-IDs that for one reason or another do not come in automatically or that come in incorrectly. 5) The benchmark query takes approximately 15 minutes to complete. The more books that are officialized, the longer the query takes. 6) When books are unofficialized and reofficialized, this effectively sends that book to the back of the GRMS que. This means that the entire process must be started over. 7) Now that plugging positions is no longer an option, I have to spend time researching any variances that arise between the GRMS position and the ERMS position. 8) If the book admin and I cannot solve the problem, then I have to contact the GRMS support team. Since this usually occurs after their regular hours it takes a ",robin.rodrigue@enron.com,david.baumbach@enron.com,'David' : 'person',1,Benchmark Process,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,received,david.baumbach@enron.com
