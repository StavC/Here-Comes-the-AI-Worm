"David: On #1, I would say the problem is not with the calculation part, but with the market information, or lack thereof (i.e., illiquidity). The gas desk is responsible for the supplying prices and volatilities. It is upto them to decide how they want to account for illiquidy: change the bid/offer spreads accordingly, or add hedging costs, or something else. And on the correlations, they do matter but not as much as volatility or price. Since these are correlations for the same underlying at the same location across time, I think we can make some reasonable assumptions and compute them. Regarding #2, I don't agree with the concept of a market top. What the desk does with the options is to hedge them. And the way to hedge them is hedge teh delta and exercise the options optimally at the same time. Finally, I don't think we can use a 2-year swap as a proxy for a 10-year swap. Longer term prices and volatilies are driven by the cost of production and economic variables and their uncertainities. Those don't necessarily reflect the shorter term issues.

"Marty: Absolutely yes! We are now using option functions in the Exotic options library (in R:\Exotica which everybody in Risk Management has access to) instead of the old Visual Basic code in the powermod file. This improved the calculation speed for options quite a bit. We are also embarking on a new project to develop the next generation structuring and pricing models. I will discuss about this project in more detail with you soon and get your input, but the main goals I see now are: 1. Superior performance (speed) to enable fast pricing especially for the underwriting group, 2. Proper documentation for easy maintenance and ability to quickly adapt to meet future needs, and 3. Security/access control to the files. The first stage in this process is to take inventory of what we have: I am documenting the current structuring models. This step is important not only for developing our next generation models but also for the AA audit of all the EES pricing models. Krishna.

All these units had difficult and relatively long projects that required experience in energy markets, derivatives pricing and business knowledge that I had gained over the last few years at Enron. 2. There has been a significant change in the team members reporting to me. I now have six people under me compared to only three at the begin of the year. Of the current six members, five joined us only this year and most of them didn't have any prior work experience, thus requiring a lot of my time in recruiting, training and mentoring. 3.

I could not use us all of my available vacation this year because of the following reasons: 1. As you know, I have been supporting three business units (EES, EPG & Enron India) this year. All these units had difficult and relatively long projects that required experience in energy markets, derivatives pricing and business knowledge that I had gained over the last few years at Enron. 2. There has been a significant change in the team members reporting to me. I now have six people under me compared to only three at the begin of the year. Of the current six members, five joined us only this year and most of them didn't have any prior work experience, thus requiring a lot of my time in recruiting, training and mentoring. 3. Given that I had to visit our Bombay office in January, 2000 for a business trip (10 days) and will need to go there again in January, 2001, I could not take leave from my work for the other two units (EES & EPG) for an extended period of time.

It has been four years since the first edition was published. During this hiatus, a lot has happened as risk management within the rapidly expanding energy industry has come of age as a respected discipline. The second edition is a rich compilation of papers by a surprisingly representative group of industry leaders, practitioners and academics. The books strength is that it reinforces the fact that risk management principles initially applied to a narrow band of energy commodities can and should be applied across a wide array of energy commodities including electricity. As expected the book does a solid job in capturing an international perspective on the various challenges, which are not isolated to any one continent but are global in scope. It includes a lengthy introduction that effectively frames risk management progress, advancements and innovations that started in the oil markets in the 1970's and migrat",vince.kaminski@enron.com,pinnamaneni.krishnarao@enron.com,"'Krishna' : 'person', 'Vince Shirley' : 'person', 'Vince Pinnamaneni Krishnarao' : 'person', 'Vince J Kaminski' : 'person', 'Krishna' : 'person', 'Vince J Kaminski' : 'person', 'Stinson Gibner' : 'person', 'Pinnamaneni Krishnarao' : 'person', 'vkaminski@aol.com' : 'email', 'Mark Williams' : 'person'",10,Re: Book review,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,received,pinnamaneni.krishnarao@enron.com

EES's Risk Management and the vast majority of EES's Risk Controls and Operations Group will become a new group in Enron Wholesale Services. This group's sole function will be to provide pricing, structuring, commodity risk management, logistics and back-office services for EES. Both Don Black and Wanda Curry will report to the EWS Office of the Chairman. This change was driven by the explosive growth of EES and the resulting need to tap the systems, resources and risk expertise of the wholesale groups in order to continue to grow and take advantage of current market opportunities. This change will allow us to more quickly capture the benefits of scale, process, and technology in risk, logistics and back-office functions from the larger Enron capability. As discussed at the All Employee Meeting in March, these are important objectives, and this change allows us to reach those goals more quickly. Specifically, the following groups within the former EES Risk Management Group, will become a part of this new group reporting to Don Black: - the gas, power and tariff desks, - the options desk, -",osman.sezgen@enron.com,pinnamaneni.krishnarao@enron.com,"'Osman Sezgen' : 'person', 'Kay Chapman' : 'person', 'Don Black' : 'person', 'Wanda Curry' : 'person', 'Don Black' : 'person'",5,Organizational Announcement,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,received,pinnamaneni.krishnarao@enron.com

It has been four years since the first edition was published. During this hiatus, a lot has happened as risk management within the rapidly expanding energy industry has come of age as a respected discipline. The second edition is a rich compilation of papers by a surprisingly representative group of industry leaders, practitioners and academics. The books strength is that it reinforces the fact that risk management principles initially applied to a narrow band of energy commodities can and should be applied across a wide array of energy commodities including electricity. As expected the book does a solid job in capturing an international perspective on the various challenges, which are not isolated to any one continent but are global in scope. It includes a lengthy introduction that effectively frames risk management progress, advancements and innovations that started in the oil markets in the 1970's and migrat",vince.kaminski@enron.com,pinnamaneni.krishnarao@enron.com,"'Krishna' : 'person', 'Vince Shirley' : 'person', 'Vince Pinnamaneni Krishnarao' : 'person', 'Vince J Kaminski' : 'person', 'Krishna' : 'person', 'Vince J Kaminski' : 'person', 'Stinson Gibner' : 'person', 'Pinnamaneni Krishnarao' : 'person', 'vkaminski@aol.com' : 'email', 'Mark Williams' : 'person'",10,Re: Book review,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,received,pinnamaneni.krishnarao@enron.com

I could not use us all of my available vacation this year because of the following reasons: 1. As you know, I have been supporting three business units (EES, EPG & Enron India) this year. All these units had difficult and relatively long projects that required experience in energy markets, derivatives pricing and business knowledge that I had gained over the last few years at Enron. 2. There has been a significant change in the team members reporting to me. I now have six people under me compared to only three at the begin of the year. Of the current six members, five joined us only this year and most of them didn't have any prior work experience, thus requiring a lot of my time in recruiting, training and mentoring. 3. Given that I had to visit our Bombay office in January, 2000 for a business trip (10 days) and will need to go there again in January, 2001, I could not take leave from my work for the other two units (EES & EPG) for an extended period of time. So, in summary, this year has been a long and challenging one, and as a result, I could not take vacation for more than a few days. I request you to grant the rollover of my remaining vacation to next year.

I have developed the concept whereby we are now looking at a firm component (over peak period), and an infirm power sale during the monsoon. The series of quesions and comments from my team in te attachment below should help you a bit to get a feel for the proposal. I am currently in Houston and reachable at 281-345-9870. I maybe needing a surgery for the slip disc but am currently on medication hoping that surgery won't be needed.
