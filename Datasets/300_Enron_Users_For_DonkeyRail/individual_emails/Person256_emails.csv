"CONFIDENTIAL AND LEGALLY PRIVILEGED Vicki Many thanks for your assistance yesterday. Clinton Energy Management Services, Inc. because it holds a current power marketing certificate is an entity which we would like to move to being a direct subsidiary of Enron Corp. to take effect today. This is considered to be an essential part of restructuring to meet our current and future needs. While the day to day control will remain where it is and all the efforts assign contracts and other work should progress as planned, since the value to Enron Corp. is the power marketing certificate nothing should be done to jeopardize this. In addition we will be changing the charter and will need copies of the existing charter to effect those changes required. Please call me if you need to discuss this further.

I still think I need to talk to FERC staff before we file. Here's why: - - FERC, as you know, is about to issue a new rule on market-based rate eligibility. - - In the meantime, they've been kicking out a very high percentage of MBR applicants for trumped up reasons. I.e., issuing deficiency letters on issues we know they don't care about. I think the real reason is they don't want to issue a lot of approvals until the new rule comes out. - - No matter how perfect our filing is, we're liable to get kicked out, too. They might not want to give MBR to a new Enron entity until they see the new rule. - - The best way to deal with that is to sit down with staff, go over the draft page by page, and see what more they want.

"Liz Agreed that all parties would review the proposed framework with traders to try to ""fill in the boxes"". It was however recognised that there were difficulties in interpreting what was intended by the proposed RTO's and the relationship with the current Into Cinergy market. AEP viewed that purchase of transmission was the critical area, who had to purchase what and several scenarios to work through. Whether Seller buys a wheel, whether buyer buys a wheel, or under MISO both parties buy a wheel. This clearly has knock on effect for obligations in respect of firm and non-firm transmission and curtailment. In particular, what if non-firm is elected and how this flows through into obligations of the parties to a transaction. Perception that the framework prepared by AEP will start all interested parties in the same place to talk about the issues. It was agreed to try to get a representative from Duke to join the next call as they were an Into Cinergy product trader as well. The next call was scheduled for November 29th at 10 o clock Eastern time. It was suggested that everyone at least take first page of Mitch's schedule and talk to the traders, since this would probably the best starting point, Mitch encouraged any comments to be shared earlier if possible.

"My understanding is that we have posted bonds in excess of $60M and are in compliance with the NEPOOL Financial Assurance Policy. EPMI and EES are not relying upon an Enron Corp. guaranty to provide any part of the financial assurance required by NEPOOL. Suggest we can take one of four courses of action: (1) Do nothing; (2) Request and authorize the ISO-NE to disclose to concerned NEPOOL participants the fact that EPMI and EES have posted bonds to ensure compliance with the NEPOOL Financial Assurance Policy and that no part of the financial assurance required is provided by an Enron Corp. guaranty; (3) Send a letter to all NEPOOL participants confirming that EPMI and EES financial assurance obligations are being met solely by the posting of bonds; (4) Combination of both (2) and (3). If there is a perception or a clear understanding that the credit downgrade of Enron Corp. is the reason for a reduction in trading activity with EPMI and/or EES in NEPOOL and that NEPOOL participants will respond favorably if they knew that the financial assurance is provided by way of bonds, not an Enron Corp. guaranty, then option (1) should be discarded. Option (2) may be enough to give the comfort to ""concerned"" participants.

"Michelle Fortunately we have already received some advice on the effects of bankruptcy on NOxTech from our patent counsel, which is attached. This is very promising and appears to put us very much in control of the intellectual property. Turning to the employment of the key individual, Bruce Sudduth, you will see from the covering email that we might want to take some immediate steps to preserve our ability to access him in the event bankruptcy is declared, however I am not convinced on the limited amount of information that we would not be running the risk of a tortious interference claim, unless we agreed it with the directors of NOxTech first and then proposed it to Bruce.

"Mark Welcome back!! I was in New York last week reviewing the current contractual situation on our metals contracts and in discussions with Craig Young he mentioned that they had some Canadian customers as well as some in Mexico and I believe Peru, Chile and Brazil. In respect of the Canadian clients it was his understanding that the fact that the MG entity carrying out the business did not have an office in Canada was material. I am not sure of the regulatory implications of having customers outside of the US, or inside for that matter, but thought it would be something that you might need to investigate further with Craig. In addition, as part of the Rudolf Wolf acquisition, we have a trader based in New York, who is employed by Enron Trading Services Inc, executing deals in London for and on behalf of Turkish clients. I am not sure whether this needs to be investigated further, but it sounds like it might require it. Again Craig Young has all the relevant details.

In short, there should be no CEL problems with respect to trading of physical aluminium, offshore or through a subsidiary in Japan, but there is a risk that trading of aluminium futures will be deemed to be ""facility"" in breach of the CEL, which danger is increased if the activities are conducted by a subsidiary in Japan.

Unfortunately we have found it not very practicable to send a compare version but you may wish to run a compare yourself as against the draft previously sent. The main changes are in relation to the Commodities Exchange Law. In short, there should be no CEL problems with respect to trading of physical aluminium, offshore or through a subsidiary in Japan, but there is a risk that trading of aluminium futures will be deemed to be ""facility"" in breach of the CEL, which danger is increased if the activities are conducted by a subsidiary in Japan. We have not of course at this stage reviewed any derivatives documentation. Let me know if we can help further.

"In addition to other issues, we will need to check that the DIP financing arrangements will permit the posting of collateral and in the amount required. Travis McCullough is well placed to address this issue. -----Original Message----- From: Padron, Juan Sent: Thursday, December 06, 2001 9:30 AM To: Stubblefield, Wade; Herndon, Rogers; Steffes, James D.; Nicolay, Christi L.; Sager, Elizabeth; Smith, Mike B; Sharp, Vicki; Dietrich, Janet Cc: Nettelton, Marcus Subject: NYISO collateral due FRIDAY 12/7 Wade, In order for EES to participate in the Monthly ICAP Auction on 12/13, we need to wire cash collateral of $750,000 to NYISO by COB Friday 12/7. The cash collateral must be adequate to allow the amount of ICAP we need to clear in the market (or we will be exposed to the Monthly Deficiency Auction -- which could be much higher than the ""regular"" Monthly Auction). Our Physical Delivery Load will increase significantly starting 01/01/02 (and stabilize, thereafter) to ~ 70 MW. In addition, NYISO is offsetting the cash collateral of $680,000 that was wired to them last Friday against previous month's Energy and ICAP bills. While we can attempt to technically argue against this offset due to the bankruptcy, the loss of status to continue transacting with the NYISO will violate the reps in our customer agreements, and, thus, risk the validity of the book (est. $60MM). The calculation of the offset is below. T",marcus.nettelton@enron.com,"juan.padron@enron.com, wade.stubblefield@enron.com, rogers.herndon@enron.com,

"Tana I am not sure whether adequate notification has been received from PECO or ComEd since their merger to form Exelon, however all trades with these two former entities should be with Exelon Generation Company, LLC as all agreements have been assigned and assumed by this new entity. Exelon have indicated that they are not prepared to sign an EEI Master Agreement for at least three months while they complete their restructuring. In the interim the area that I see causing potential confusion is if on EnronOnline, for example, different terms were agreed with PECO and ComEd. If this is the case please advise and we will need to find a solution to avoid any confusion going forward.

"Liz Attached are suggested changes to the Long Description to more closely align the Into product in the EEI with the EOL Into product. The Force Majeure relief for this particular product has been clarified to ensure that Force Majeure relief is not available in the event that non-firm transmission is scheduled. If we add the EEI definition of Force Majeure, the applicability or otherwise to certain products would need to be set out in the Long Description. At this stage, since we are focusing on the Into product, I would propose that the GTCs remain the same, until we make the more widesweeping change to bring EOL in line with EEI. When you are back lets meet to discuss how best to take this forward. As to the broader change to reflect the EEI, we will need to consider how to deal with the issues on the Cover Sheet. The credit terms are probably not something that we can achieve ""click"" approvals of just yet, however the changes we would like to see to the EEI could obviously be included as part of the ""click"" and accept concept on EOL. I will be giving this further thought and will make some recommendations when I have had the opportunity to go through the documents and the issues which will need to be addressed.

"Lin As you know Enron Power Marketing, Inc (""EPMI"") had executed an EEI Master Agreement with Commonwealth Edison Company and with the assignment and assumption of this Agreement, amongst others, and with no EEI Master Agreement in place with PECO, unless otherwise agreed by the parties we will assume that this EEI Master Agreement will govern future transactions between EPMI and Exelon Generating Company, LLC (""Exelon""). There may be some credit issues going forward, however while we have the Exelon Corp. guaranty in place in its current form, we do not have any credit issues insofar as they relate to physical power trading. However, in the interim, we will need to clearly identify, at an operational level, with whom we are trading. To that end we will be terminating access to EnronOnline to all users who are still trading under either PECO or ComEd identifications. While we realise that they are trading for and on behalf of Exelon, this is an operational matter and we will need to carry out this task to reflect the legal position. This is not to be taken as, and is not a consent by EPMI to any such assignment or assumption, but solely a suggested way forward in the short term to ensure clarity in any dealings between the new legal entity that is Exelon and EPMI Kind regards, Marcus",marcus.nettelton@enron.com,ljohnson@pwrteam.com,"'Lin' : 'person', 'Marcus' : 'person'",2,Re: Trading Contracts and Arrangements,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,sent,marcus.nettelton@enron.com

I have already had several meetings with the desk heads and Elizabeth Sager on this very issue and work has begun. This is a huge industry issue given the changing RTO landscape and its potential effects on the traditional ""into"" product. Until there is clarity on the RTO market structure and transmission rights, there is simply not language that we can get comfortable with. Rather than blame the traders and/or legal for transaction difficulty, why not immerse yourself into the MISO and Alliance documents and find potential opportunities. Learn the difference between LMP and ""into"". What are the congestion areas in the Midwest. What will the basis markets look like? What is a basis market?What generation units will benefit from LMP/zonal pricing? What generation will get hurt by congestion? With regulatory change lies opportunity for marketing transactions. The fact of the matter is a 2003-06 Into-Cinergy trade (long or short) contains significant regulatory risk, and to protect Enron's shareholders, we need to price addition premium",elizabeth.sager@enron.com,marcus.nettelton@enron.com,"'Alice' : 'person', 'Elizabeth Sager' : 'person', '713-853-6349' : 'phone number', 'Presto, Kevin M.' : 'person', 'Dalton III, Oscar' : 'person', 'Baughman, Edward D.' : 'person', 'Clynes, Terri' : 'person', 'Sturm, Fletcher J.' : 'person', 'Davis, Mark Dana' : 'person', 'Benson, Robert' : 'person', 'Elizabeth Sager' : 'person'",11,FW: RTO Development and impact to Commercial Transactions,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,received,marcus.nettelton@enron.com
