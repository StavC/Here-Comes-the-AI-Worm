They are asking now to a proposal of minimum 5 years, and upto 12 if we can make it. So they will be taking the risk of not having a fuel supply that matches de 25 year Power Purchase Agreement. 2.- The Points of Sale will be in the U.S. Mexico Border, so we will not have to get an export permit of any sort. 3.- Swing: This is going to be a base load plant, that will be dispatched around 90% on a yearly average.
