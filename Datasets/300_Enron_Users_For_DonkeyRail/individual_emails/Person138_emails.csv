"May I please have your comments if any on this draft by close of business Wednesday. We hope to have agreed on the Q&A's by then and to send it out the announcement on Thursday. John To be sent to: All Enron Europe, all employees in Japan, all Global Markets and all VPs and up around the company Enron has established several wholesale businesses in Japan in the last year including Metals, Power Plant Development (via our investment in EnCom), Coal, LNG & Weather. Though Japan continues to make progress towards a liberalized electricity market, significant barriers to power trading remain under the current interim market structure. Until further tangible steps are taken to improve third party access for electricity in Japan, we will suspend our power marketing efforts and focus on the significant opportunities that currently exist in our other wholesale businesses. Once the necessary regulatory changes have been completed we expect to aggressively pursue Enron's traditional position as the leading buyer and seller of electricity in every deregulated market. Based on these changes Joe Hirl our President of Enron Japan will move to the Global Markets group and lead a team that will focus on developing all our Global Markets opportunities in Japan especially Weather, Oil, LNG, Coal, and Shipping. We expect to continue our general recruiting of Japanese nationals and as President of Enron Japan, Joe will continue to provide the overall business leadership to both recruiting and the Analyst and Associate program in Japan. The Finance origination team headed by Jeremy Thirsk will continue to report to Joe and also move to Global Markets.

Brent and I will be working with Fernley next week to iron out the details of our support for Fernley during that transition period. We will also map out an Enron trading operations introduction for Michael Jordan, which may involve a short stint for him in Houston. My goal is to provide a strong resource to Fernley during this transition period and to work with Fernley to provide whatever assistance, training, and orientation to Michael in his role so that his assimilation can be as smooth and effective as possible. Another purpose for the trip is to spend some time with Fernley and his business controllers to get their ideas on specific goals that as a group we would commit to for 2000.

"Ken I mentioned in a voicemail today that you should be receiving a phone call from James (Jimbo) Moffet (504) 582-4000. He is Chairman of Freeport McMahon in New Orleans. James had mentioned to Thomas Boettcher & Michael Hutchinson in our Metals group that he knew you and wanted to make sure you were supportive of our discussions with them. Here is the background on a possible acquisition that we have brought up with them: Enron Metals is very interested in pursuing further discussions with Atlantic Copper on the acquisition of their smelter in Spain. Estimated capital would be US$350 Million. Acquiring this asset gives us the opportunity to build copper and copper concentrate positions and more effectively managing our positions in the market place. We would finance this off balance sheet. Mr. James Targetta, head of Atlantic Copper (copper smelter and refinery in Spain and fully owned by Freeport McMoran) had a conversation with James Moffet, Chairman of Freeport McMoran last Friday informing him about our preliminary conversations. Moffet advised Targetta not to proceed further until he speaks to you since he has known you for 25 years. In addition, Targetta mentioned the possibility for Enron purchasing all the copper mining activities of Freeport McMoran which would leave them as an oil and exploration company. We think there are some great possibilities here. If you have not heard from him in the next few days, I would really appreciate you giving Moffet a call.

"Ken - I thought I would give you a quick update on our conversations regarding Atlantic Copper. Our team met with the senior management from Atlantic Copper last week in concert with the London Metal Exchange Week. There are several hurdles to overcome in structuring a deal to acquire Atlantic Copper and a long term copper concentrates supply from FM's Indonesian mine complex. Current contract prices for copper smelting and refining capacity are low and they might be a bit unrealistic on price. We suggested a conceptual structure that may work but is probably a long shot at this time. They were interested and requested a more definitive proposal, which we will develop this week.

"The Forbes April 30, 2001 editorial piece ""Slow Starters"" on page 24 discusses the ""entry tax"" which is the capital burden for starting a new business. It states that rich countries on average have relatively low entry costs while poor countries have stagering entry costs caused by corruption, endless beuacracy, and cost of delays. These ""entry hurdles"" and asscoiated costs do not produce any tangible benefits for consumers, workers or the environment. We might want to make the analogy of ""entry tax"" for new deregulated gas & power markets. Things like negotiated third-party access (rather than regulated TPA) substantially slow the speed of new entrants and hence deter competition. Negotiated TPA creates uncertainty for new entrants (they never know what they are going to get) and clearly slows the new comers down. I will send you a copy of the Forbes piece.

"I thought the EIP was the stock option hedging. Who is doing that and how are we tracking it so it doesn't get screwed up like it did earlier in the year. John To: John Sherriff/LON/ECT@ECT cc: John J Lavorato/Corp/Enron@Enron Subject: Re: Authorized Traders John, The Policy was re-written in haste in the fall of 1998 (by some chump named seyfried) to attempt to incorporate a new paradigm in the way we managed our Merchant Portfolio. The new paradigm never materialized for a number of reasons, leaving the Policy somewhat ambiguous. We had been hesitant to change it given that we were never quite sure whether or not this thought process would be resurrected. It appears that now would be a good time to consider changes to reflect current business practices and add clarity. I will take a shot at it myself for the August Board meeting, however, I would prefer to do so with your and Lavo's input. Please advise at your earliest convenience. On some specifics: Officially, the EIP portfolio has never been used. It was a holdover from the SPP (supply positioning pool) associated with the Sithe transaction. There have been those that have referenced EIP/SPP in the past, however, I believe that this was done so in error and not in compliance with Policy.

We will receive 75% of all revenue Reuters collects from subscriptions to EnronOnline quotes. It is an evergreen 1 yr contract with mutual termination rights upon 90 days prior notice. We are under no obligations to provide levels of service. Revenue expectations: Reuters will charge, initially, $150/month/desktop. They have 5,000 Energy desktops worldwide. thus with 100% penetration we would get 5,000 x 150 x 12 x .75= $6,750,000; With a more realistic assumption of 50% penetration the yield to Enron would be $3,375,000 p.a. This revenue does not include the incremental benefits, in our view, of branding and standardization of our product and liquidity in the marketplace. In the future I could see us adding a transactable API to the product through Reuters, which would enhance the ease of transaction by Reuters users.

"The Forbes April 30, 2001 editorial piece ""Slow Starters"" on page 24 discusses the ""entry tax"" which is the capital burden for starting a new business. It states that rich countries on average have relatively low entry costs while poor countries have stagering entry costs caused by corruption, endless beuacracy, and cost of delays. These ""entry hurdles"" and asscoiated costs do not produce any tangible benefits for consumers, workers or the environment. We might want to make the analogy of ""entry tax"" for new deregulated gas & power markets. Things like negotiated third-party access (rather than regulated TPA) substantially slow the speed of new entrants and hence deter competition. Negotiated TPA creates uncertainty for new entrants (they never know what they are going to get) and clearly slows the new comers down. I will send you a copy of the Forbes piece.

I was not involved in the LNG ship project. I shall read the DASH and give you my comments. Without looking at the details, I think that the decision to charter a tanker removes one significant risk we have at the Elba Island project (please, see point 2). 2. Elba Island. I am working with Doug Rotenberbg, Brad Hitch, Scott Earnest (Sally Beck's organization) and RAC to set up the book for the Elba Island transaction. The next step will be to expand the book to capture all the Enron's LNG-related positions in one place and to look for natural risk offsets and possible hedges. A working group is meeting to close a few remaining gaps tomorrow (Tuesday) at 8:30. A few comments on the book design and my view of the project: a.

He is interested in coming back and is talking with many areas of enron for positions. His girlfriend, Julie Ferrara, is in Net Works and may becoming to London as an assignment. If she does, he would really like to come as well - if it is possible. I didn't know if you have a need but he is great and would make an excellent Jr. commercial guy in an origination type of role.

"John, thanks for the comments. Absolutely on the trader comment, I forgot. I like the ag business and we are looking at several oppts and making a final determination in Q1.

He runs a power business (i think) in Portugal. He has attempted to talk to someone at Enron in Europe but hasn't heard back. He has given me his email address and requested a contact.

"John, This is the update on what I have done for the LNG transactions. 1. I was not involved in the LNG ship project. I shall read the DASH and give you my comments. Without looking at the details, I think that the decision to charter a tanker removes one significant risk we have at the Elba Island project (please, see point 2). 2. Elba Island. I am working with Doug Rotenberbg, Brad Hitch, Scott Earnest (Sally Beck's organization) and RAC to set up the book for the Elba Island transaction. The next step will be to expand the book to capture all the Enron's LNG-related positions in one place and to look for natural risk offsets and possible hedges. A working group is meeting to close a few remaining gaps tomorrow (Tuesday) at 8:30. A few comments on the book design and my view of the project: a. The current thinking is that LNG will be sourced for the Elba Island facility by buying marginal cargos on the fob basis. Marginal cargos will represent supply from excess capacity that has not been committed under long-term contracts or became available due to some short-term frictions. The fob cargos are typically selling at a significant discount to the long-term contract prices. The economics of the deal, as represented by the book we are setting up, will reflect the assumption that not only we can locate marginal cargos but that we shall be able to do it on a regular basis, arranging shipping and coordinating the facility schedule and natural gas transactions in the US.

"As you probably all know, we are on the verge of launching credit derivatives trading in Europe and North America, both on Enron Online and off-line. This will involve quoting prices for buying and selling bankruptcy protection in respect of reference entities, many of whom are our counterparties in a variety of different commercial and financial contexts. This exciting cocktail of credit derivatives and Enron Online raises significant novel legal risks for Enron. Probably the most significant risk arises where Enron has confidential information about a reference entity and wrongfully uses that information in pricing the credit derivative on that entity. This could well result in legal proceeding against Enron. In practice, an allegation of misuse of confidential information can be very difficult indeed to defend without adequate procedures in place to safeguard that information. Against this background is the ever-present risk of ""insider dealing"". This crime - which carries a maximum prison sentence of 7 years and an unlimited fine - is committed where a person (or member of their family etc) deals in the securities (shares or bonds) of a listed company on the basis of unpublished (confidential) price-sensitive information. In addition, SFA rules require the safeguarding of confidential information, the misuse of which is a serious disciplinary matter. In order to ensure the success of this new business, we are now introducing new policies and procedures (attached) which include a simple Restricted List procedure.

"John, A couple of thoughts to follow on from yesterday. If your prime motivation in completing shutting down the merchant power effort versus turning it down is to send a strong signal to the government, then I believe the message will be undermined by Enron's continued efforts through EPower. In order to be most effective and show commitment to the ""message"" strategy then it would be consistent to shutdown the efforts of EPower (something none of us believes makes sense). While METI would understand that EJ reducing its efforts is significant, they will breathe a sigh of relief that Enron is not pulling out of power since EPower efforts are continuing. As many in the market still believe that EPower will be marketing and retailing power as well as building power plants, it will look as though not much has changed regarding Enron. In fact, many of the other new entrants, Marubeni, Ennet, Nippon Steel, etc have indicated to us that they will reduce efforts now and look to the future for further change (in effect exactly what we are talking about doing). Many of these companies are looking at building 100 Mw stations that could be available in the next 12-18 months. METI is undoubtedly aware of this and is working to bring pressure on the utes and further development to the market structure as soon as they are able (timing uncertain). In summary, I believe that you would be able to send the same message through reducing EJ's efforts down to a slow boil, but allow us to keep abreast of what is going on",joseph.hirl@enron.com,john.sherriff@enron.com,'John' : 'person',1,Re: Draft Organizational Announcement about Japan,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,received,john.sherriff@enron.com

"John, I am writing to you regarding the management of the London Research group. As you know, Dale Surbey, who was managing the London unit of the Research Group, is moving to EBS. Dale did a terrific job helping me to develop the pool of talent we have currently in London. Given that Dale is likely to be transfered to Houston, it's time to nominate one member of the Research Group for a management position. My recommendation is Steve Leppard. Steve emerged not only as the most technically qualified member of the group but also as a natural leader, highly respected by his peers and internal customers. Steve has a very high energy level and is very efficient as a manager and as coach of new talent. His promotion is likely to cause Anjam's departure form Enron. I value technical skills of Anjam, but in spite of my loyalty to him, don't think he is the same caliber as Steve. However, I would not like to lose him and think about moving him to Houston for 2 years. I think that the opportunity to work in Houston, would be a sufficient incentive to keep him in Enron. By the way, his performance feedback has greatly improved. Please, let me know what you think.

Given that Dale is likely to be transfered to Houston, it's time to nominate one member of the Research Group for a management position. My recommendation is Steve Leppard. Steve emerged not only as the most technically qualified member of the group but also as a natural leader, highly respected by his peers and internal customers. Steve has a very high energy level and is very efficient as a manager and as coach of new talent. His promotion is likely to cause Anjam's departure form Enron. I value technical skills of Anjam, but in spite of my loyalty to him, don't think he is the same caliber as Steve. However, I would not like to lose him and think about moving him to Houston for 2 years. I think that the opportunity to work in Houston, would be a sufficient incentive to keep him in Enron. By the way, his performance feedback has greatly improved. Please, let me know what you think.

I don't know if Jeff has called Mulva but that is the right action before we do anything else. John will hear the result of that conversation as soon as it happens. Thanks and good luck.

I guess we were just too good at our jobs... My quick look at the amended contract tells me that our best contractual avenue is to analyze the possibility of wilful default under the contract, in which case the cap on damages would not apply. Peter, as you and I discussed, the Bacton option may help our analysis on this. I definitely would want to get outside counsel advice on the point, and in any event I agree that going to Mulva is the right approach",mike.mcconnell@enron.com,john.sherriff@enron.com,"'John' : 'person', 'Mike McConnell' : 'person', 'Mike McConnell' : 'person', 'Peter Crilly' : 'person', 'Mary Nell Browning' : 'person', 'Jeff' : 'person', 'John' : 'person', 'Peter Crilly' : 'person', 'Mary Nell Browning' : 'person', 'Mike McConnell' : 'person', 'John' : 'person', 'Mary Nell Browning' : 'person', 'Mike McConnell' : 'person', 'Peter Crilly' : 'person'",14,Re: J-Block,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,received,john.sherriff@enron.com
"Yes, that is the level that we will be talking to him about. m John Sherriff 03/30/2001 10:47 AM To: Mike McConnell/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: Subject: Re: FW: Resume: w/contact info Mike - so you would say he would come in at a manager level? I appreciate the lead. John From: Mike McConnell 30/03/2001 17:29 To: John Sherriff/LON/ECT@ECT cc: Subject: FW: Resume: w/contact info John, Attached for your review is a resume for Trevor Woods. He worked for me in 2 areas, including directly for me in Technology. He is outstanding and left enron to join his brother in law in a start up out in San Francisco. He was an associate at the time. He is interested in coming back and is talking with many areas of enron for positions. His girlfriend, Julie Ferrara, is in Net Works and may becoming to London as an assignment. If she does, he would really like to come as well - if it is possible. I didn't know if you have a need but he is great and would make an excellent Jr. commercial guy in an origination type of role. I wanted you to have shot at him as well.
