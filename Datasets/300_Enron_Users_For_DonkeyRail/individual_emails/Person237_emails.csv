There are now about 40 counterparties that fall under this category. What seems to be happening is that these counterparties are hitting on US gas products on EOL and are not bridging into Tagg correctly. Currently, they are bridging as one leg between ENA and the counterparty. The problem arises during settlement because ENA cannot settle with these counterparties, only ECC can. An example of what Risk is doing to the products after bridging is Tagg#Q79131 / EOL #555401. RISK: We need risk to verify that anytime, without exception, all companies with Master Agreements with ECC that hit a US product must be booked as two legs: leg one booked between ECC and the counterparty with risk assignment of FT-US/CAND-ERMS; leg two flipping the risk out of FT-US/CAND-ERMS to the appropriate risk",dawn.kenne@enron.com,jason.wolfe@enron.com,"'Dawn C Kenne' : 'person', 'Dawn C Kenne' : 'person', 'Jeffrey C Gossett' : 'person', 'Michael Swaim' : 'person', 'Torrey Moorer' : 'person', 'Tara Sweitzer' : 'person', 'Jennifer deBoisblanc Denny' : 'person', 'Kam Keiser' : 'person', 'Darron C Giron' : 'person', 'William Kelly' : 'person', 'David Baumbach' : 'person'",11,Counterparties w/ Master Agreements with ECC,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,sent,dawn.kenne@enron.com

Yesterday, there were a total of eight deals duplicating, so far today there are six. They have narrowed down the problem and Mike Swaim and Oscar Rivera think it should be resolved this afternoon. Meanwhile, Oscar is running a query that will let us know the duplicate deals. He will run this throughout the day and I will e-mail you the deals. Listed below in Bold is the duplicate deals from today (two are from late last night). I have placed the risk book next to the deals. Please forward this to the appropriate people in your group. I was not sure who runs the Singapore book, if London could let me know I would appreciate it. I will keep you updated on the progress. Sorry for any inconvenience this may be causing.

Nothing really happened. All was quiet. If anyone was upset about anything they didn't tell me about it. I did get an email from Frank Cernseck(or how ever you spell his name). It seems we took too much as broker fees in July. I haven't researched it, but from what Victor tells me that's an adjustment that needs to be made on last day P&L.

This is the transaction where Phillip mistakenly put the incorrect product on the web, Reliant hit on it, and then Phillip got out of the deal by talking to Reliant over the phone.
