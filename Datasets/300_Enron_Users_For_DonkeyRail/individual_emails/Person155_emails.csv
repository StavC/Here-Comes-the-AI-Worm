To summarize: 1.Oglethorpe Power Corp.: The Interchange Agreement supplied is expired. Is there an amendment or extension? 2.Ameren Services Company: The contract is sell only (Ameren sells to EPMI), but we have positions in our books whereby Ameren has the obligation to purchase from EPMI. There must be a MPPSA or another contract that allows for purchases as well. Ameren has the obligation to purchase 300-400 MW on-peak for next summer. This one should be a relatively easy sell/assignment to a third party. 3.Connecticut Light & Power: Termination is subject to conditions outlined in the Mid-Connecticut Project Termination, Assignment and Assumption Agreement (I think this is the bigger CRRA agreement).

"Genia - These documents are FINE with me and they conform to Ed's Credit Worksheet. As far as I am concerned they are ready to be sent out. I did see Ed's email though and I have tried to call him to ask if he wants a Unilateral MAC to apply to Enron as well (the language is in there for the CP.) Can you please get an answer from him on this? If for some reason Ed wants a unilateral MAC to apply to Enron too- just put it in where it needs to go and send the doc's out. The doc's need to go to Dave Hutchens who is the trader at TECP. His email address is dhutchens@tucsonelectric.com. His number is 520-745-7118. He is a client of our marketer - Kim Ward.

Thanks, Genia Tana Jones 02/26/2001 03:54 PM To: Genia FitzGerald/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: Janet H Moore/HOU/ECT@ECT Subject: Re: Confidentiality Agreement As a general matter, you need to use the forms of Confidentiality Agreements contained in the atty.fms bank, not the Swap Group's forms. We have developed a few of our own forms for special purposes, one, which is in the swap forms database/current forms, protects the counterparty only, and is used when Credit wants to get copies of financal statements from a counterparty and protects the financial information being provided by the counterparty. I have developed forms for use by the EnronOnline team, but those should not be used for any Enron company except EnronOnline and Enron Net Works. For any other types of matters/projects, we would also use the forms contained in the atty.fms bank.
