"Chris Long (Enron) and I spent yesterday on Capitol Hill. We met with House Agriculture Committee Minority and Majority Staff, Senate Banking Committee Staff and Senate Agriculture Committee Staff. The bill clearly is moving and there is a good chance it will go to the Floor of the House next week. The bilateral exemption for physical commodities (non-agricultural commodities) is accepted and should be secure. We have problems with the electronic trading facility exemption for physical commodities. House The House Agriculture Committee remains inclined to exclude metals from the exemption. We are working with the Commerce Committee (which has not excluded metals) to change that result. Senate We have a much more severe problem in the Senate. Senate democrats led by Senator Harkin are very concerned to go against the CFTC in favor of big energy companies. They want the CFTC to endorse the exemption. Unfortunately, as you are aware, the CFTC (recently the Chairman himself) have been heavily lobbying against the exemption. We are working with staff and will keep you posted. We have prepared talking points and bullets which are still in draft to distribute to the Hill. I would appreciate your comments on them and your thoughts. ---------------------------------- This e-mail is sent by a law firm and contains information that may be privileged and confidential.

"I, along with counsel for ISDA and counsel for the Coalition of Banks and Investment Banks, met with Chairman Rainer and CFTC staff this morning. As you are aware, Senator Lugar and Congressman Ewing asked us to work with the CFTC to resolve our disagreement over how energy and other nonfinancial commodities should be regulated. This dispute and the even more significant dispute over SEC-CFTC jurisdiction (the Accord) are the most significant remaining issues with the legislation. In that context, you may be aware that the CFTC and SEC reported to Congress yesterday that they have not been able to work out the Accord issues. We were informed prior to our meeting this morning that the House and Senate bills on CFTC reauthorization are likely to be introduced today. I will transmit copies as soon as I get them. It is my understanding that both bills do a good job for us with respect to legal certainty for energy and other nonfinancial commodities. In this light, we met with the CFTC and reviewed with them the attached two-page legislative proposal. The most significant problem that we have is the CFTC's discomfort at providing an exclusion for bilateral, nonfinancial transactions. In essence, the CFTC does not want to go beyond the recommendations of the President's Working Group. We have continued to insist that nonfinancial bilateral transactions be treated like financial bilateral transactions and be carved out of CFTC jurisdiction.

"I have conferred with industry representatives on the CFTC's suggestion. We have a problem with it from a couple of perspectives: 1. Although NYMEX is the benchmark for pricing of a few energy commodities, most of the pricing of transactions is done based on price reporting services such as Platt's, Megawatt Daily and Reuters. These services collect information on transactions from industry representatives and report usually on a daily basis benchmark prices for a large number of energy commodities. This activity has never been regulated by anyone. Obviously, these price reporting services have provided valuable price information to the industry. We do not see a need for regulation of price reporting whether it from a price reporting service or an electronic trading system. 2. We are concerned that the manner in which the CFTC would regulate/oversee price reporting would be very awkward and difficult. The drafting of such a provision would be complex and the discretion it would give the CFTC to potentially regulate through price reporting would be troubling. We are very interested in achieving the exclusion that the draft legislation currently provides. We would be prepared to discuss the matter further in the hope of maintaining the exclusion. Please let me know what you think. >>> <Walter_Lukken@agriculture.senate.gov> 05/02 11:52 AM >>> Thanks for the language. We will make sure that weather derivatives are included.

"I, along with counsel for ISDA and counsel for the Coalition of Banks and Investment Banks, met with Chairman Rainer and CFTC staff this morning. As you are aware, Senator Lugar and Congressman Ewing asked us to work with the CFTC to resolve our disagreement over how energy and other nonfinancial commodities should be regulated. This dispute and the even more significant dispute over SEC-CFTC jurisdiction (the Accord) are the most significant remaining issues with the legislation. In that context, you may be aware that the CFTC and SEC reported to Congress yesterday that they have not been able to work out the Accord issues. We were informed prior to our meeting this morning that the House and Senate bills on CFTC reauthorization are likely to be introduced today. I will transmit copies as soon as I get them. It is my understanding that both bills do a good job for us with respect to legal certainty for energy and other nonfinancial commodities. In this light, we met with the CFTC and reviewed with them the attached two-page legislative proposal. The most significant problem that we have is the CFTC's discomfort at providing an exclusion for bilateral, nonfinancial transactions. In essence, the CFTC does not want to go beyond the recommendations of the President's Working Group. We have continued to insist that nonfinancial bilateral transactions be treated like financial bilateral transactions and be carved out of CFTC jurisdiction. Our meeting was very cordial and the CFTC said that they would be taking our comments into consideration.
