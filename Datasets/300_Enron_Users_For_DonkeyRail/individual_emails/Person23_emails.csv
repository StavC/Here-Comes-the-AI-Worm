"This is to inform you that we are rolling out changes to the Gas Daily option pricing model. Currently the system is not properly pricing index puts and calls at locations with gas daily index premiums or discounts (puts and calls are priced at the same level no matter what the index). The change will result in raising call values/lowering put values at locations with index premiums and the opposite at locations with index discounts. In addition, index plus/minus option deals (for example index -1.00 puts) - which are currently incorrectly priced flat to the index option (the index -1.00 put is priced flat to the index put)- will be accurately priced to reflect the difference in strikes. If anyone has any questions please call me at 3-6731. Thank You, Larry May",larry.may@enron.com,"john.lavorato@enron.com, john.disturnal@enron.com, louise.kitchen@enron.com,

Foreign Report presents an alternative view Israel's military intelligence service, Aman, suspects that Iraq is the state that sponsored the suicide attacks on the New York Trade Center and the Pentagon in Washington. Directing the mission, Aman officers believe, were two of the world's foremost terrorist masterminds: the Lebanese Imad Mughniyeh, head of the special overseas operations for Hizbullah, and the Egyptian Dr Ayman Al Zawahiri, senior member of Al-Qaeda and possible successor of the ailing Osama Bin Laden. The two men have not been seen for some time. Mughniyeh is probably the world's most wanted outlaw. Unconfirmed reports in Beirut say he has undergone plastic surgery and is unrecognisable. Zawahiri is thought to be based in Egypt. He could be Bin Laden's chief representative outside Afghanistan. The Iraqis, who for several years paid smaller groups to do their dirty work, were quick to discover the advantages of Al-Qaeda. The Israeli sources claim that for the past two years Iraqi intelligence officers were shuttling between Baghdad and Afghanistan, meeting with Ayman Al Zawahiri.

"Hi Larry; First, I find the work to be exceedingly rewarding, and addictive. I have been working in the community for 17 years, and have found that I am listened to, allowed to speak and take risks, and allowed to provide realtime assistance to the top policy makers in our country. My frustrations are that at times, I would like to enact action quickly, and often have to wait for others to add their pieces to the puzzle, or for a chain of command to look at my ideas (I am a GS-14 in a GS-15/DISL job). For someone like me, that's hard! I would think your background WOULD make you a viable candidate, and would recommend that you apply to CIA, DIA, and NSA, among others. Yuo can apply directly through each of their websites. ALL are hiring. Georgetown's program is terrific. I went there. JMIC is okay, but I think Georgetown would give you what you really need. Georgetown's National Security Studies Program is TOP. I'd be more than happy to speak with you, but recommend waiting a bit. My time is not really my own these days,and I am currently working 7 days a week, literally (my last day off was 9 September), often 12-16 hours a day. When I get home, I do my school work, and play with my kids. That doesn't leave much time! Let's see if things calm down in a week or so? marian ""May, Larry"" wrote: > Dear Dr. Leerburger, > > Thank you for your",drmahl@erols.com,larry.may@enron.com,"'Larry' : 'person', 'Yuo' : 'person', 'marian' : 'person', 'Larry' : 'person', 'Dr. Leerburger' : 'person'",5,Re: Larry May - AMU Student,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,received,larry.may@enron.com

Currently the system is not properly pricing index puts and calls at locations with gas daily index premiums or discounts (puts and calls are priced at the same level no matter what the index). The change will result in raising call values/lowering put values at locations with index premiums and the opposite at locations with index discounts. In addition, index plus/minus option deals (for example index -1.00 puts) - which are currently incorrectly priced flat to the index option (the index -1.00 put is priced flat to the index put)- will be accurately priced to reflect the difference in strikes.

LLC of Houston to assume ownership of a 37-mile portion of Transcontinental Gas Pipeline's Lower New York Bay Extension and add 16,000 hp of compression in Middlesex County, NY, in order to boost gas deliveries into New York City by about 125,000 Dth/d. The Cross Bay project, first announced in January 1998, is estimated to cost $59.5 million. Once completed, the compressor station and pipeline would form a new interstate pipeline system that would extend from Middlesex County across the lower New York Bay, all the way to Nassau County, NY. The pipeline's capacity would be more than 600,000 Dth/d, with the additional 125,000 Dth/d of incremental capacity.
