"Bhavna: The basis report has been updated to cover 2000 prices. It is called Basisnw7.xls and is in the ERG database. It looks to be working correctly, but of course without data it is a little hard to confirm. As always, it is ultimately your job to verify that the numbers reported are correct. Lemme know if there are problems. It is easy to change the spreadsheet to start a new year. You should keep this mail message as a reference. 1) Add 12 to the expression in ""PrintMacro""!B35 i.e. change COPY(OFFSET(HenryCash,12*AgainstYear+63,i,12,1)) to COPY(OFFSET(HenryCash,12*AgainstYear+75,i,12,1)) 2) Define a new cell reference on the basis page for the first date to be printed out on the report page. For example, last year, the basis report went from Jan 93 to Dec 1999. In Basisnw6.xls there is a name ""Jan93"" defined as ""Basis""!A64 (i.e. refers to the row where the Jan 1993 basis numbers are recorded). This year, in Basisnw7.xls, I defined ""Jan94"" to refer to ""Basis""!A76. That's because the basis report will now run from Jan 1994 to Dec 2000. 3) Change the expression in ""PrintMacro""!B45 to use this new cell reference i.e. change COPY(OFFSET(Jan93,12*IndexYear,Report,12,1)) to COPY(OFFSET(Jan94,12*IndexYear,Report,12,1)",grant.masson@enron.com,bhavna.pandya@enron.com,"'Bhavna' : 'person', 'HenryCash' : 'person', 'HenryCash' : 'person'",3,New basis report,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,sent,grant.masson@enron.com

"Dear all: A few words about Tom. He is a power engineer type who has previously worked at northwestern US and New Zealand utilities on various projects including asset planning and hydro scheduling. He was hired by EI Structuring to oversee modeling efforts using SDDP, Henwood, etc. Because of the recent implosion at EI APACHE, Tom's group has effectively evaporated, and thus he is looking for a new home. He has some finance background from having to do asset evaluation for utility rate filings. He has almost no options experience. He seems to have quite a bit of experience in some classes of OR problems. Clearly the most obvious fit is with my group, but the idea is for you all to see if Tom has a tool set that may be of use to other research projects. And, as usual, the personality fit is the other aspect to examine. This is meant to be casual. If the consensus is positive, then I will explore the formalities of such a transfer.

"Bhavna: The basis report has been updated to cover 2000 prices. It is called Basisnw7.xls and is in the ERG database. It looks to be working correctly, but of course without data it is a little hard to confirm. As always, it is ultimately your job to verify that the numbers reported are correct. Lemme know if there are problems. It is easy to change the spreadsheet to start a new year. You should keep this mail message as a reference. 1) Add 12 to the expression in ""PrintMacro""!B35 i.e. change COPY(OFFSET(HenryCash,12*AgainstYear+63,i,12,1)) to COPY(OFFSET(HenryCash,12*AgainstYear+75,i,12,1)) 2) Define a new cell reference on the basis page for the first date to be printed out on the report page. For example, last year, the basis report went from Jan 93 to Dec 1999. In Basisnw6.xls there is a name ""Jan93"" defined as ""Basis""!A64 (i.e. refers to the row where the Jan 1993 basis numbers are recorded). This year, in Basisnw7.xls, I defined ""Jan94"" to refer to ""Basis""!A76. That's because the basis report will now run from Jan 1994 to Dec 2000. 3) Change the expression in ""PrintMacro""!B45 to use this new cell reference i.e. change COPY(OFFSET(Jan93,12*IndexYear,Report,12,1)) to COPY(OFFSET(Jan94,12*IndexYear,Report,12,1)",grant.masson@enron.com,bhavna.pandya@enron.com,"'Bhavna' : 'person', 'HenryCash' : 'person', 'HenryCash' : 'person'",3,New basis report,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,sent,grant.masson@enron.com

"Dear all: A few words about Tom. He is a power engineer type who has previously worked at northwestern US and New Zealand utilities on various projects including asset planning and hydro scheduling. He was hired by EI Structuring to oversee modeling efforts using SDDP, Henwood, etc. Because of the recent implosion at EI APACHE, Tom's group has effectively evaporated, and thus he is looking for a new home. He has some finance background from having to do asset evaluation for utility rate filings. He has almost no options experience. He seems to have quite a bit of experience in some classes of OR problems. Clearly the most obvious fit is with my group, but the idea is for you all to see if Tom has a tool set that may be of use to other research projects. And, as usual, the personality fit is the other aspect to examine. This is meant to be casual. If the consensus is positive, then I will explore the formalities of such a transfer.

If you were to state the likelihood function for the GARCH model, it might justify the amount of attention to gave to estimation for simple iid processes, which could then be thought of as a simple lead-in and intuition builder to the more interesting models that you do actually use. By the way, in your discussion of smiles, you discuss fat tails extensively. At least for equity markets, while fat tails contribute, they don't do very much at all compared to the effect of risk premia, which you allude to briefly, using supply-demand language, at the end of that section.

Generally, I like it, and find it non-controversial and well written. Of course, this is a huge topic and there are things that you haven't discussed. I thought the amount of attention paid to OLS and MLE estimation was a bit overboard, given that you didn't really exploit it in your results. If you were to state the likelihood function for the GARCH model, it might justify the amount of attention to gave to estimation for simple iid processes, which could then be thought of as a simple lead-in and intuition builder to the more interesting models that you do actually use. By the way, in your discussion of smiles, you discuss fat tails extensively. At least for equity markets, while fat tails contribute, they don't do very much at all compared to the effect of risk premia, which you allude to briefly, using supply-demand language, at the end of that section. For the impact of risk premia, see Jun Pan's paper, which is available from her web page. But she covers only SP500, (as do most studies), and your markets are obviously much different.

If you could just answer the questions posed by Vince, and send me the final figure then we are a go (all of ours are now finished).

We discuss the estimation of volatility from both historical and implied data, again from the perspective of the energy user. We further discussed a number of stochastic volatility models and have shown how to estimate the models via ordinary least squares and maximum likelihood. We have tested our estimation techniques on a number of examples drawn from energy markets including electricity, gas and crude oil. Best regards.

Index VaR and the Vega VaR status: Because any modification of the VaR model has to be coded into the new version by IT, the Index VaR model and the Vega VaR model are on the waiting list to get into IT group's door. Currently, they are struggling with the Credit Model. Accord to Jonathan Le, they will implement the ""Prudency"" model after the ""Credit"" and before anything else. So, it's uncertain when they can begin these two projects. Credit Reserve Model status: New version developed by IT is still in the debugging stage. Two major difference exist between the new and old versions: 1) Old version uses delta-gammar methodology, new version uses full evaluation. IT group is not comfortable with their implementation of the ""Spread option"" and ""Swaption"" evaluation. I am working with them on it. 2) Insurance projects are new to the new version. IT also wants our help too. Only after the IT finishes the debugging process, could we start testing the new version with the current one. Thanks.

"Dear Vince and Grant, I am currently reviewing some of the more erecent references on EVT and its application. I get back to you shortly with some points regarding the usefulness of EVT and how traders (electricity and weather) can benefit from EVT. Cheers, Christian To: Christian Werner/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT cc: Subject: Re: extreme value theory applied to weathet Christian: To my knowledge, the research group is examining EVT primarily in the context of Value at Risk calculations. We have not looked at EVT for power, because, to date, we have been focussing on shorter term fundamental forecasting of price excursions: i.e. given tomorrow's load forecasts and expected plant dispatch, we attempt to predict which lines will become constrained and how the system will react to alleviate these constraints. I would be interested in your thoughts on how EVT would benefit the traders however. As far as the weather goes, I would expect the weather desk to use EVT at some level. Clearly you should talk to Joe Hrgovcic, the researhc chap attached to the weather desk, for a more accurate assessment.

Based on where Europe is marked (especially for the UK), I think we'll find a significant difference out beyond 10 years. Fundamentally, it seems like the long-term vol should be similar for a given commodity regardless of geographic location. Has Research done any work on this in the past? If not, we should study this since long-term vol feeds into the VAR-based position limits. Give me a call so we can discuss.
