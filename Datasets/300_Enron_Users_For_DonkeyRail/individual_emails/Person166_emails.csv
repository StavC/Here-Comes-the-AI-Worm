"Jonathan, Ned, Enron Europe Limited would be fine, thanks. And a couple of other questions, which blend with the ones I mentioned below. has there been issued any statement by the CFTC or other regulatory body regarding the point about marketing via the Internet not infringing 30/10 relief, i.e without breaching the limited marketing rules? Can LME Contracts therefore be marketed via the EnronOnline website to US customers, bearing in mind that the underlying principal to the LME Contract would (so far as EnronOnline is concerned) be Enron Metals Limited (formerly known as MGL)? As an aside, each Counterparty that is given access to the EnronOnline system is required to execute certain ""access"" documentation - for the US, the Enron entity to these documents is EnronOnline LLC, and for Europe, the entity is Enron Power Operations Limited. In each case, EnronOnline LLC and Enron Power Operations Limited execute these documents on behalf of themselves as well as their group undertakings. But note that no cases will EnronOnline LLC or Enron Power Operations Limited be the Enron contracting entity to any trade concluded via EnronOnline. is MG London Inc. (the FCM) required to act as agent or as principal under the LME Contracts with US customers, or can it merely market to US customers and then pass these on to Enron Metals Limited in London for execution, whether offlline or via EnronOnline?

"Just a few comments on the Text: You may wish to specify throughout that all time references are to ""GMT"" The examples given for the offline nominations procedures imply that nominations/re-nominations made by the customer are NOT effective until Enron has responded affirmatively - this is not how the underlying GTC reads (under which such customer nominations/re-nominations become effective without subsequent Enron's ""confirmation"") On the last page , I would remove the reference to a Master, since this does not currently apply to EnBank trades Presumably , you are not now proceeding on the basis of a separate ATA (i.e. Auctions Trading Agreement governing EOL access)?

"Gary, Trena, The key points are: 1. Any FX business conducted from London must in most cases be done by or through a specifically authorised SFA-regulated entity. None of the MG London entities is authorised to conduct this type of business. The choices therefore are: - Set up a new SFA-regulated entity specifically authorised to carry on this type of business (up to 6 months to implement) - Change the current authorisation of the regulated MG London entities to permit this type of business (this would involve a material change to its current authorisation ) - Consider using Enron Europe Finance & Trading Limited (""EEFT""), which is SFA-regulated. However, the approval of SFA would be required to extend the scope of its current SFA authorisation to include this type of business. Note also that EEFT Enron Europe Finance & Trading Limited currently acts as agent only and not as principal - this is primarily for regulatory capital reasons for unregulated entity. Any proposed extension of EEFT's current authorisation must also be carefully considered in the light of the potential increased risk of consolidated supervision from a regulatory capital perspective. 2. Enron carries on all of its current investment business with commercial enterprises, and not private individuals. And there are good reasons for this. From a legal and regulatory perspective, this exposes Enron to fewer potential risks and to a significantly lower degree of regulatory compliance. If Enron were to carry on this business with private individuals, this would materially increase the level of regulatory compliance",justin.boyd@enron.com,"gary.hickerson@enron.com, trena.mcfarland@enron.com","'Gary' : 'person', 'Trena' : 'person'",2,FX Business,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,sent,justin.boyd@enron.com

It comprises a share-for-share exchange of 1 ICE Class A1 Share and 1 ICE Class B (Redeemable) Share for each IPE Share (note that ICE Shares are not listed on any exchange). ? The following values (given by Goldman Sachs and KPMG) have been ascribed to each such ICE Share: - each ICE Class A1 Share has an estimated value ranging from $1.75 to $6.11 - assuming redemption, each ICE Class B Share has an estimated value ranging from $4.80 to $5.33 - assuming no redemption, each ICE Class B Share has an estimated value in the same range as each A1 Share ? Class B Shares allow for certain rights of redemption by ICE for cash, namely $5.895 per share. Redemption rights arise for a period of one month from the first anniversary of the date on which the IPE Brent Futures and the Gasoil Futures Contracts have traded exclusively for 10 consecutive trading days through the electronic trading platform. Redemption rights also arise in other circumstances, e.g. if ICE is the subject of an insolvency event.

"Thanks for the feedback. I think this is right in line with CRM's proposal and will definitely meet our objective to control credit risks with higher risk counterparties. It is an excellent Phase 1 solution which we certainly can try to address more systematically in future developments. We have done some initial review of the current deal flow in Houston and London and don't expect this language to impact a high percentage of transactions. Based on our review of recently executed Enron transactions we expect about 80% of total transactions will not be impacted by this language. Most of our deal flow is with highly rated counterparties. However, as we build the Online Trading volume with more customers, we expect the majority of our customers will require this GTC language.

My comments/questions were: What is the rationale for requiring margin from the broker, given its role as agent for the client? What if the client refuses to accept/acknowledge the trade - I assume the agent is nonetheless liable? The margin will secure the risk between treansaction and confirmation with the counterparty. the broker will pay liquidated damages if counterparty does not accept the trade. (risk is essentially 1-3 days) I assume we will negotiate a fully-fledged agreement with each broker, covering all the usual protections for Enron (indemnities/right of agent to bind its principal/reps and warranties/duties & obligations of agent/liability of agent/margin arrangements) Yes. Mark Taylor is drafting the agreement. the agreement will lay out the margin requirements, liquidated damages, etc. I am not sure that the broker is acting as a agent for the customer as the customer may not even know that the broker is transacting on EnronOnline.

"Justin - Further to our conversation yesterday I have reviewed the existing HDD Swap GTC's. In contrast to the Financial GTC's which when read with the ETA are drafted on the basis that the GTC's only apply if an ISDA has not been executed, the HDD Swap GTC's have been drafted to work in unison with the ISDA framework. The HDD Swap GTC together with the specific documentation for each transaction constitutes a Confirmation under the ISDA Form. I have made some drafting changes in this regard the most important of which is the carve out of the language in the ETA which provides that GTC's will only apply if an ISDA has been executed. Incidentally - with respect to the ETA - it seems to provide that the relevant GTC's will apply in respect of a Transaction if an ISDA is not in place on the trade date of such transaction, however it does not seem to make any provision for circumstances where an ISDA/Master Agreement is entered into subsequent to the execution of a Transaction. In such circumstances on a literal interpretation of the ETA, the pre-existing Transaction would continued to be governed by the GTC but future Transactions would be governed by the ISDA/Master Agreement. From a netting perspective this is not ideal. Is this the intention ? Give me a shout when you have had a chance to review the attached.

There is actually quite a bit of activity around this project this week, and I want to be sure I keep you up to date on what is going on (and give you an opportunity to smack me down if I'm headed off in the wrong direction). I have spoken to Mark Taylor about this, but I wanted to consult you as well. The Clickpaper site does not currently have the functionality to display a Password Application or Electronic Trading Agreement (actually, it is an ""Electronic Transactions Agreement"" in Clickpaper) for any jurisdiction other than US/Canada. Customers in those jurisdictions will be able to print out a Password Application and sign and return it, and then ""click"" through the Electronic Transactions Agreement, just as they currently do on EnronOnline. The Pulp and Paper Group has identified several potential customers in non-US jurisdictions that they would like to ""enroll"" on Clickpaper as soon as possible. Since we will not be able to display jurisdiction-specific Password Applications or ETAs on the site, we will send to those customers a jurisdiction-specific Password Application and ETA by courier, both of which will provide for agreement by manual signatures (the ETA will be revised to add signature lines and take out references to agreement by ""clicking""). Since Clickpaper's North America ETA and Password Application are virtually identical to those of EOL; It appears that Clickpaper should also be able to adopt EnronOnline's versions of those agreements for the other jurisdictions (that is,",travis.mccullough@enron.com,justin.boyd@enron.com,"'Justin' : 'person', 'Mark Taylor' : 'person'",2,Clickpaper,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,received,justin.boyd@enron.com

"Why do you say OK for weather? What restrictions do you have for counterparties trading weather? Justin Boyd 03/23/2001 02:20 AM To: Tana Jones/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: Subject: Re: Amerada-Hess Corporation hi tana they're fine for non US & Canadian based products (including physical power) - the standard exceptions would be US power, weather and credit derivatives j From: Tana Jones on 22/03/2001 16:48 CST To: Justin Boyd/LON/ECT@ECT cc: Subject: Amerada-Hess Corporation As an introduction: The referenced counterparty is trying to straighten out the online products it wants to trade with us (it's open for some, but not all of the products it wants to trade). When I looked at Profile Manager to see what they had already been approved to trade, I noticed that this counterparty was opened to trade many of the European products, including specifically European physical power products (which is unusual for a US based counterparty to trade). Before I go in and change the profile for this counterparty, I wanted to check with you and see if London had specifically opened them to trade the products they were opened to trade (especially physical power). What I usually do when I am approving US based counterparties, is that with respect to Non Us & Canadian products, as long as they are an Eligible Swap Participant I open them up for all products except European physical power, which I never open them for. Also, Credit Derivatives, I never open anyone up for unless we really mean it.

"Justin, Enron Canada is currently in an unresolved dispute with Bank of Nova Scotia where from our perspective Bank of Nova Scotia has essentially been telling us to shove off. The dispute involves BNS's purported requirement to consent to collateral security given to Enron Canada for physical and financial trading positions with a counterparty known as Beau Canada. Neither Bank of Nova Scotia nor any affiliate of Bank of Nova Scotia should be traded OnLine and all trading ought to be monitored until such time as this matter is resolved, and this should be expressly communicated to Bank of Nova Scotia. They can speak to me directly at 403.974.6923 or to our President and CEO, Rob Milnthorp at 403.974.6714. I am copying this memo to Bill Bradford and Mark Taylor for their information.

"Justin - are the EnBank contracts physical or financial? It seems to me we should use the same customer profiles - that is if the contracts are physical, then any counterparty which can trade physical UK gas should have access. If the contracts are financial, then any counterparty that can trade UK derivatives should have access.

"Unless you object, we have decided to structure the auction site with the ""auction procedures"" set out on the bid page, immediately above the ""submit"" button. As soon as the bid is submitted, the system will check to see if the counterparty has already accepted the GTC's or has a master in place. Here is S&C's first draft of the procedures for an auction without a reserve price, with no commitment to sell (or buy) and no disclosure of bids to other parties. It is my impression that this is the way the EnBank auctions will be conducted. Is that correct? Any suggestions/comments?
