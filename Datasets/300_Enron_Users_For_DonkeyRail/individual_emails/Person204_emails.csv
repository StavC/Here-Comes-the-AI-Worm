"Pushkar I quickly plotted the short and the long curves and the following come out in your face. 1. Is this policy easing going to be a one shot ( a la 98 ) followed by a quick pick up in economic activity, or is this going to be a more deeper situation. That is the big one. The curves vote for a small road-bump which will be rectified by a couple of eases over the next 6 months. Something the Fed can handle easily and quickly. This is most likely NOT going to happen - this is not a 98 and things are going to play out differently. There are a number of other possibilities. 2. The current slow-down is two pronged - capital spending slowdown from businesses ( especially on IT with the internet bust ) and the consumer spending slow-down , possibly because of the stock market wealth effect. Both of these have already hit the durable goods section. This reversal is 'Real' which takes longer to turn then the 'Financial crisis' hence there is good possibility we see a protraction of this weakness and even coupled with the fed eases this is going to take longer than six months to get better. 3. The new administration is going to take this as a good opportunity to force tax cuts. How does the Fed look at those ? Will the Fed balk and be less aggressive in the rate cuts expecting the tax cuts , will it ignore them. That makes the equation harder. It also to some extent argues that longer term rates go",harry.arora@enron.com,pushkar.shahi@enron.com,'I' : 'person',1,US fixed income,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,sent,harry.arora@enron.com

"Following the discussions I have had with Louise and Jay, this is the proposed solution to the interest rate risk management in NEWCO. 1. For the first few weeks ( to a few months) we continue to use Infinity to update the curves at 2 PM. I will need to have one trader to execute, mark curves and do any deals for foreign exchange (Cd$ etc.). Louise, I hope you have this in your budget and headcount. I will need one junior trader(and maybe two as things grow) to help do this job. I have lined up one of the guys in the old trading desk, if this goes forward. 2. In the first few weeks, Jay Webb and myself are hoping to acquire a lighter, and much simpler interest rate package which will allow us to do what we do, with significantly lower costs. We also will re-design the way we aggregate interest rate risk in the commodity books, to make it simpler and easier. To ensure there is no more discussion ever of drift-reallocation, I propose a method where, every desk head gets back his complete interest rate portfolio drift every month or quarter (less any transaction expenses ). I would expect that, the interest rate curve shift will be small till we build a somewhat longer dated portfolio, while the drift could start becoming substantial pretty quickly (as we start making money). Hope this answers the questions. We will have the curves at the right time, done by the trading group. We will still measure and manage our own exposure to both interest rates and currencies. We intend to allocate small",harry.arora@enron.com,"louise.kitchen@enron.com, w..white@enron.com, jay.webb@enron.com","'Louise' : 'person', 'Louise' : 'person', 'Jay Webb' : 'person'",3,RE: Interest Rates,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,sent,harry.arora@enron.com

""He has the trust and confidence of our investors and financial institutions."" Andrew Fastow, previously Enron's CFO, will be on a leave of absence from the company.

"Hi Nik This is the nasty side of American business. There is nothing to be embarassed or discouraged about. These are hard times and I think your graduation timing is no help either. People graduating '98 through '00 had it goood. But hang in there, opportunities are fewer, but they are out there. You might want to broaden your search into energy and healthcare. Enron is one heck of a story. What a ride ! The only conclusion I have is, next time I see some professor about efficient stock markets, I am going to smack him bad. As hard it is to manage businesses in trouble, it is not easy to manage businesses which are over-valued either. There is huge propensity for management to be complacent and attribute it to themselves, while it might be the investors folly and nothing more. I have been on the ride up and down and all I can say is you live and you learn. I will look out for opportunities out here. Enron is trying to stay close to core businesses but the energy industry in general is still hiring and complacent. You keep at it bud, and things are going to get better.

"Pushkar I quickly plotted the short and the long curves and the following come out in your face. 1. Is this policy easing going to be a one shot ( a la 98 ) followed by a quick pick up in economic activity, or is this going to be a more deeper situation. That is the big one. The curves vote for a small road-bump which will be rectified by a couple of eases over the next 6 months. Something the Fed can handle easily and quickly. This is most likely NOT going to happen - this is not a 98 and things are going to play out differently. There are a number of other possibilities. 2. The current slow-down is two pronged - capital spending slowdown from businesses ( especially on IT with the internet bust ) and the consumer spending slow-down , possibly because of the stock market wealth effect. Both of these have already hit the durable goods section. This reversal is 'Real' which takes longer to turn then the 'Financial crisis' hence there is good possibility we see a protraction of this weakness and even coupled with the fed eases this is going to take longer than six months to get better. 3. The new administration is going to take this as a good opportunity to force tax cuts. How does the Fed look at those ? Will the Fed balk and be less aggressive in the rate cuts expecting the tax cuts , will it ignore them. That makes the equation harder. It also to some extent argues that longer term rates go",harry.arora@enron.com,pushkar.shahi@enron.com,'I' : 'person',1,US fixed income,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,sent,harry.arora@enron.com

Philippe would like to arrange 3 or 4 bidders to compete in a live, online DealBench auction. He mentioned that you would be in charge of contacting Compaq, NEC and the other suppliers of these displays and would be the primary Enron person involved in this procurement (I'm estimating it at a $2 to $4 million contract).

"Dear Mr. Arora: Hope this mail finds you in the best of health and cheer. I am sorry to know that I have not been selected for the Enron Summer Associate Program and would greatly appreciate any feedback that you can offer me with regards to interview that I had with Enron. I am extremely interested in working at Enron and firmly believe that my prior experience in the commodities trading arena and the skills that I gain in my MBA program will enable me to add significant value to Enron. I plan to apply for the full time program at Enron and would like to use the feedback to prepare myself for the full time associate program at Enron. Many Thanks once again for taking the time and effort to interview me at Owen and also for considering me for the Enron Summer Associate Program.

Our general recommendation is that the number of lots should be around 10 but if there are situations where it makes sense to have more than 10 lots, we would not have a problem with it. From a pricing perspective, as long as bids*lots is less than 150, we would treat it in a similar way. Hope that works for you.

"Harry, I hope all is going well in Houston. Thanks again for introducing me around Enron when I cam to visit a couple months ago. Hopefully you heard that I accepted the internship and will be starting on June 4th. I am very excited about getting involved with Enron, learning as much as possible, and hopefully contributing value to some interesting projects. I am writing you for some advice. I do not know which group I will be working in this summer. I am very excited about the company and would like to perform well once I start. Is there something I could do to prepare myself? I would like to begin reading and learning about the industry. Unfortunately, Enron is involved in several industries, making it difficult to know which to research. Do you have any suggestions? I look forward to seeing you this summer.
