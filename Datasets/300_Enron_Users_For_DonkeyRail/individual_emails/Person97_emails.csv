Tim Ling, chairman of TradeRanger, will open the keynote session at 8:10 with a discussion of the evolution of his procurement hub and how he and his senior management team intend to manage fourteen disparate buying organizations through one e-marketplace representing $120 billion in annual spending. Tim will be followed by a McKinsey director, likely to be Ron Hulme or Scott Nyquist, who will discuss e-business strategy conclusions that McKinsey has drawn concerning the energy industry. Greg will then follow in the lineup depending on whether we start upstream and move down, or vice versa. We finish at 11:00. In the second option, Greg would participate in a 90-minute panel with two to three other executives and moderated by the director from McKinsey. Under this scenario, Ling opens and is followed by the McKinsey presentation.

I think your suggestion of Mike McConnell is great -- in fact I saw a piece on energy e-business in Sunday's Chronicle in which Mike was heavily quoted albeit in his former role as CEO of Enron Global Technologies. I don't know Mike well but met him a couple of times in London in connection with a financing that Chase led on the TGTL situation. Anyway, you had asked about other presenters and format. The format will be a panel dicussion during which each company will give a 10 - 15 minute business overview probably in a powerpoint format with books for audience members to take away. Following the formal presentations there will be questions both from the floor and from the moderator to be addressed by all panel members. Assuming that EnronOnline is able to participate on the Energy Exchange panel the moderator will be yours truly -- so I'll be serving up some softballs for Mike.
