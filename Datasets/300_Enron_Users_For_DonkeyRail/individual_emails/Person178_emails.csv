MRT GAS ENA had a term supply contract with Energen to purchase roughly 4,485MMBTU a day at 2.60 on MRT, which Energen terminated on December the 4th, 2001. The operator for the supply, Duke Field Services, erroneously allowed supply to continue to flow between Dec. 4-31. ENA also failed to remove its nomination for the supply, allowing it to continue to flow to ENA's market, Oneok. Duke Field Services would like to get paid for the gas it delivered and has offer to sell ENA the gas at a price of 2.3375 (gas daily average for MRT West Leg). I have spoken with David Eubanks in gas settlements and he shows ENA receiving and delivering the gas to Oneok. I would like to try to get the MRT issue settled as soon as possible, for I feel that it would help facilitate the Centana Storage account (approximately $2,500,000 in positive cash flow).

Regards, Ed -----Original Message----- From: Penman, Gregg Sent: Friday, December 28, 2001 10:42 AM To: Luce, Laura; McMichael Jr., Ed Cc: Tomaski, Richard Subject: enovate/EMW bank accounts As part of our ongoing discussions regarding the viability of enovate/EMW, we need to further address the bank account and funds flow situation. Here are the facts to the best of my knowledge: 1 - enovate has a separate Citibank bank account that should be able to send and receive payments. There have been some bumps along the way, but I think they may be resolved. 2 - Pre-petition, EMW shared the same bank accounts as ENA. Money that came into the account was allocated back to the appropriate entity by accounting. 3 - Post-petition, EMW shares the same bank accounts as several other non-bankrupt Enron companies. 4 - However, Accounting and Treasury have told me that we cannot use the new account because funds are not flowing out of the account and that if any money comes into the account it may not be released or credited to the appropriate entity. In order to preserve the viability of enovate/EMW and fulfill our obligations, we would prefer to be able to move funds through EMW.

"I regret to decline to review Jean. I went through the form for her but was not able to provide nearly enough meaningful feedback to justify. I have worked a lot with Jean over time, but mostly indirectly this period. We have had occasional interaction (a couple brief meetings and a couple phone conversations) about the development and status of the wellhead book. In addition, she did attend one of the inter-departmental wellhead book meetings that I hosted and we have collaborated on Analysts/Associates, but I have not really worked closely with her this period. She may feel that we have worked more together that we have based on the time I have spent with John Grass and others related to the wellhead book, but my direct interaction with her has been minimal. On the positive side, she has been very helpful by identifying good Analysts/Associates for me. She thinks highly of gas structuring as a rotation opportunity and she is one of my best advocates with the Analysts/Associates. She worked with me to let me take Kelli Little (Assoc) when some of the deals she was working on were put on hold. Furthermore, she has forwarded resumes and/or had individuals contact me several times this period. On the negative side, I am not sure why she seemingly let John Grass struggle so long in the development of the wellhead book. I know she championed the idea and sold the idea to the office of the chair, but from my perspective she gave the ball to John and turned her attention too quickly to other opportunities.

"My only suggestion are as follows: (1) We need to be more explicit about the de-coupling of the assets from the gas that is delivered to CES by ENA. As such, I would recommend that we expand Sections 4.1 and 4.2 to include a CES paper pool storage or bank which gets credits (theoretical injections) and debits (theoretical withdrawals). The credits to the bank would be made in accordance with the ""Theoretical Storage Injection Schedule (TSIS)"" as per 4.2 and Exhibit 2. The debits to the bank would be made per the daily CES nominations on days when the retail demand is greater than the daily purchase quantity defined on Exhibit 1. The one exception to this de-coupling is that all of the debits/credits would be subject to operational constraints imposed by the Gas Storage Contracts and the Gas Transportation Contracts. The constraints should only come into play with the debits, as the TSIS (which by definition will be less than the daily MDIQ) would rarely be impacted by constraints. At the end of the term, the bank balance and the physical storage balance will need to be equal. If not, provision needs to be made for a post term true-up. (2) In the last sentence of Section 4.1, should the remedy for CES's failure to notify in a timely manner be ""penalties"" or ""ENA damages,"" which would include both penalties and trading losses &/or opportunity costs? I am not certain, but I understood it to be the latter.

LUS uses this optionality to buy less expensive power in the marketplace. There has been times that LUS takes less than the Base quantity. He would be open to a GDA keep whole for this but would like to have 24 months of history so he can compare. Tricia is working on this. For the Natchiotoches plant, Seller has an out if TransLa interrupts. LUS is given a credit of 45,000/year for fuel retention on TransLa. We need to gross up our price to account for this. There is a GDA keep whole for any vol's that are triggered. The trigger price is NYMEX plus $.04 and this basis is fixed. LUS has not nominated Surplus volumes in two years. Our bid will be reduced by $30,000 for the year by LUS to compare us to LIG's bid for gas odorization. This will not be a cost to Enron but will be used in their evaluation process.

"I got a call from Randy Curry who wants to get together with Don and me tomorrow at 2pm. I haven't checked with Don to see if he is available but they want to talk about our willingness/desire to move forward on the sale of the pad gas to Bridgeline and also our ability/willingness to pay them pre-petition amounts due under ENA storage/transport contracts. As each of you are aware, they are holding approximately 1.9 BCF of ENA's gas hostage as security for ENA's obligations under the storage/transport contracts.

"This afternoon I called Mike Stoll at MRT to update him on Enron's progress in getting Creditor Committee approval for the permanent release of the EES and EEM transport contracts. Mike said that after additional internal discussions, MRT had decided to file a Motion with the bankruptcy court on Monday just to make sure that they get in the queue to get a decision made. The Motion will request that Enron be compelled to accept or reject the contracts by a specified date. This is a change from MRT's earlier position. It appears that MRT is following PGT (PGE-NW) strategy. I asked whether the Motion would be filed in the morning or the afternoon. He said he did not know. I told him that if everything went well today with the approval process, Enron would probably be able to get the instruction letter to MRT on Monday. He said he would pass the information to their upper management. He did not know if this update would impact their decision of if or when MRT files.

"I wanted to give you an update on where we stand regarding the invoicing issue on MCV. I have spoken with MCV contact, Renee Schroll, and we are in agreement on the pricing of this contract. Apparently, for a number of months they have not agreed with what Enron was invoicing them. MCV would simply pay what they thought was due based upon the contract pricing. Chris and I are working on getting some historical information on what was invoiced versus what was actually paid. However, this has proven to be a laborious task and will take some time. We need to reconcile how far back the error goes to determine if there is any AR/AP position. Regardless, we do have the April Invoice worked out. They shortpaid us the amount that was due to us based on April non-deliveries under the MCV II contract. Chris has reviewed the replacement pricing, and believes it to be fair. I have reviewed the contract, and the replacement pricing falls within the contract parameters. The shortpay amount is $384,975.
