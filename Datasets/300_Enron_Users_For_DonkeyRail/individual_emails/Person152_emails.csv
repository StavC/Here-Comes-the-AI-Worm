"So have you figured out how to use the portal from home? I just discovered it yesterday (while at the office). We went to Arlington for my nephew's high school graduation, which was fine. Sunday we had dinner with Dan Lyons and spouse, which was wonderful. Yesterday I cooked, shopped, and puttered in the yard. Got the last caladium bulbs in the ground. I like to wait until they are on sale. The weekend just flew by. ""They"" say sleeping on backs reducing risks of sudden infant death syndrome. Go figure. At least you can see their beautiful faces while they sleep. Car seats, strollers and diapers are 100x better now. Especially the diapers. Yesterday I had a feeling that your grandbaby is a boy. Just came to me in the kitchen. I have a 50/50 chance of being right! When I was in Austin I used an ""above the water"" pedal kayak. Talk about easy. Neil is talking about us renting to see what we like best. The above the water is more stable than I expected. I had assumed that it would be tippy, but it really wasn't. Hope you have high water and not hell next weekend. ckm From: Kathleen Carnahan/ENRON@enronXgate on 05/29/2001 09:12 AM To: Kay Mann/Corp/Enron@Enron cc: Subject: RE: FW: Revised form of Memorandum of Option 25 years ago for me (Shayne is 25 today).
