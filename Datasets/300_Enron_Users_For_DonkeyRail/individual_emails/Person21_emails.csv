"Hey, Ken We had a good holiday. Except for the trip back...it usually takes around 9 hours. Last night it took 12. Other than that everything was good. Played a little golf (play may be too strong a word). Watched a little football. Our game with Texas was much better than I expected. I can't believe Colorado ran over Nebraska like that. And the OU game...I love college football. It is so much more exciting than the pros. Right now, I'm just sitting here watching the stock price bounce around 3.85. The big boys have been huddling quite a bit today. I think that we are close to the end. Layoffs should be announced tomorrow. So, did you get the Christmas tree after the game? 20 footer? We'll be out this weekend getting ours and putting up the lights. Jake doesn't know what's going on. But, Cole is all excited. Everything he sees, he wants for ""Chrimsas"". Knowing Jake, I will probably have to anchor the tree on all sides to keep him from bringing it down. We'll see how it goes. I hope you had happy holiday, even with the game.

"Hi, The number is 281-370-7838. I did not think of it, but without the pipe one has to balance ones own, doesn't one. Of course the major problem was the people with HPL, not the counter-parties. Who's doing that for you guys? Jen came home for the Memorial Day weekend so we just bummed around. Saw Pearl Harbor, watched a few DVD's, and ate way to much. When you get time let us know about your ""bad luck"". I hope Jake wasn't helping you too much. I have been occupying much to much time with our new sound system. We finally chucked our little bookshelf unit and got a pile of Yamaha stuff coupled to an equally large stack of Klipsch speakers. Awesome is the only word to apply. I'm sure the neighbors are loving the old people next door. (It's a young couple with a baby) (Not near as nice as the other young couple I know). Rumbling their walls at all hours just makes me feel good. :) Stock market still sucks, but as long as it pays for groceries and taxes we'll be OK. I'm off to get Linda's gas guzzlin, environment ruining, SUV washed and buffed. Then I must re-stock my CD-R's and load up on some more music.

"Darren, per our earlier conversation, here are the facts related to the opportunity to service a plant in the Freeport area off of Dow. The potential customer (Don Owen) has supplied this plant for the past 15 years, buying supply from Dow. Dow does not want to be a supplier in the future, but of course, will transport. Dow will quote only a 2 year transport ($0.06 from Katy to the plant), but the customer wants a minimum of 5 years. Other bids he is getting at Index + .03/.04 less whatever transport. The swing load is approx. 1300-1350 MMBtu/d, but fairly steady he says. Let me know if you have any interest or if I should pass this along to someone else. Thanks.
