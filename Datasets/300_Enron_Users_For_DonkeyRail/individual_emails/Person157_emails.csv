"Bruce, I haven't had an opportunity to call you directly yet, so I thought I would e-mail you first and sort of lay out the circumstances. I've been a short-term trader with Enron for about 4 years -- I run our short-term Northwest book. Prior to that, I cash traded for Portland General for a couple of years. My contract with Enron is up July 31, and I have a 3-month non-compete obligation. Theoretically, the earliest I could leave Enron would be May 31, so the earliest I could start with another shop would be Sept 1. To be honest, at this point I'm shopping. I'm talking to a couple of other outfits and I basically want to see what sort of interest there is out there. I talked with Matt, and he mentioned you, so I thought it might be a good idea to get in touch. If you are interested in pursuing anything further, please e-mail me and we'll arrange a time we can talk over the phone.

"This gets even better. On Tuesday, April 3, I had our California prescheduler ask the ISO Day Ahead personnel why the COB S/N ATC had been decreased so much. There reply was that the ATC is calculated by taking the TTC less Existing Transmission Contracts less FTRs less Capacity Benefit Margin. Normally, and up until January 1 of this year, they haven't used a Capacity Benefit Margin when calculating ATC leaving the state. So the amount of ATC they had at COB S/N is normally in the 700 to 800 MW range, rather than the 35 to 60 MW of ATC they are using now. We asked what this Capacity Benefit Margin was, and they said it's not in their tariff, it's in the NERC Operating Manual. I went to the NERC web site, and sure enough, Capacity Benefit Margin is a defined term. It reads : ""Capacity Benefit Margin is the amount of TTC reserved by load serving entities to ensure access to generation from interconnected systems to meet generation reliability requirements"". The ISO's use of this language is outrageous. This is language to ensure that load has transmission access to remote generation. I can see them using this argument with respect to COB N/S but no way COB S/N!! In fact, one could very easily argue that they are VIOLATING this criteria. If we have load in the Northwest, and have purchased generation in California, we should have access to available transmission.",sean.crandall@enron.com,alan.comnes@enron.com,,0,Re: TTC/ATC with the attachment!!,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,sent,sean.crandall@enron.com

"Audrey, Here is a brief personal work history. I've been in the utility industry pretty much since 1988. I started trading for Portland General Electric in 1995. I've been a trader for Enron for the last 4 years. I run Enron's short-term Northwest book. I have market-making responsibility for the cash, balance, and prompt months for the Mid-Columbia and COB specifically, although I am responsible for the entire Northwest. I also trade Palo Verde, SP15, and NP15. I have recently talked with a couple of other trading outfits out west and generally the structure looks something like this: 1. 150 K Base Salary 2. 250 to 300 K Signing Bonus 3. Various bonus structures, generally with a minimum guaranteed equal to the base salary. Quite frankly a move to the east coast is not very appealing. The compensation package would have to be very attractive for me to seriously consider a move to that area. If you have any questions, please let me know.

Theoretically, my last day with Enron could be May 31, so the first day I'd be able to start somewhere else would be Sept 1. To be honest, at this point I'm shopping.

The data request was unusual in the type of information it asked for, and for the most part, Enron's internal systems did not track the information in the format requested. Since the pending lawsuit involves a large amount of money, it was imperative that (1) the data be pulled together, even though our internal systems did not track this type of information in a format that was readily accessible; (2) the data be as accurate as possible, and; (3) it be done in a very short period of time. The amount of data we were asked to review and pull together was massive. Utilizing Cara's comprehensive, and fairly unique understanding of our scheduling and accounting systems, we were able to accomplish this task.

The Contract Demand is 170 MW. It is currently divided among 3 POIs. ( 50 MW at Chelan/RRH, 50 MW at Slatt/Boardman, and 70 MW at the US/Canadian Border.) The POD is Alcoa substation, near Vanalco's facility. Without a notice for change in these points, the demand would have to be used on a nonfirm basis. The value, of course, would be in the discounted price you could achieve for the demand. If you have a high load factor usage, it may be very economical. Vanalco would consider offers consistent with the secondary transmission market, subject to the process they are going through in the courts, but their objective is to preserve the asset for the future. The term of the contract begins Oct 1, 2001 and terminates Sept 30, 2002 (1 year), but rollover rights exist which have some value.

"Sean, The estimated charge for December 2000 DC Line Loss for ECTstNW is approximately $200,000.00. This number was based on the following: *The total Line Loss at SYLMAR_2_NOB was approximately 1,394 Mw *ECTstNW's allocation was approximately 920 Mw (66% of the total line loss). The 66% was derived using ECTstNW's total scheduled exports divided by EPMI's total scheduled exports. *The rate used was $217.68 which was the average of the incremental price for December 2000. I've attached a couple of spreadsheets which may be helpful. You may look forward to the final numbers for December 2000 by May 21. Please let me know if you have any questions.

"Sean, Enclosed is a proposed methodology for the Dow Jones Hourly Index. Our longer term goal is to have this information posted to a website and available on an hourly basis, with perhaps a 2 or so hour delay. That will take longer to implement and some firms have expressed reservation with receiving the information too early. Presently, our goal is to have this information available to traders via email by 5:00 a.m. PT. This is preliminary and your thoughts and comments would be appreciated.
