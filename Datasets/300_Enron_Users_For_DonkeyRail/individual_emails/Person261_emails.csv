"Mark and Barry I have talked to Crestone about backing us in a Northern Border transportation deal. Basically they are on board, however I have not shown them any economics. What I believe needs to take place is to identify Northern Border shippers who would be willing to release their capacity. Once we are able to put the capacity release economics together, which will be driven by the Northern Border shippers, we will be able to show Crestone a deal. I do not have any potential parties willing to release Northern Border capacity. I have talked to the Central desk about this opportunity, they informed me that they had no interest in this type of an arrangement. I personally believe we can manage ENA's current Northern Border position more efficiently but have been unable to convince others of this. Any ideas you can provide would be helpful.

"Hello you guys, Well I hope you have Dad doing some of the cleaning! You know how he always has an opinion but yet no participation. Anyway I hope you're doing fine. I'm fine and about to depart to Dallas TX for the weekend. I'm meeting some of my old military friends for a big party this weekend. I'm really looking forward to this party, it's due to a college football game (Oklahoma University vs the University of Texas) and has been going on for about six years now. The guy throwing the party is working hard to make it a tradition and so far he has done a very good job. The party gets bigger every year and I think this year will be the biggest. There are people flying in from all over the country. Flying now after everything that has happened isn't scary to me but now the waiting period for both check in and security has increased substantially. It's a big pain but obliviously needed.

"Paul, Attached is a schedule showing what our worksheet amounts came to for the CIG and the PSCo invoicing. To the right of that you'll see the date we (Nicole or Theresa and Mark or myself depending on which month) agreed on the amount and sent the wire transfer request to our A/P and the date the wire paid. Some months I sent the Colorado payments to A/P the same day as the Arizona payments and A/P put them together since they were to the same vendor. Hope this helps. I still maintain that this complete payment review is a separate issue from the LGS/Woodward volumes which you can clearly see that we didn't deduct (the CIG volumes are exactly what we paid) while for the same months you were billing LGS/Woodward for those volumes as well. Please do everything you can to expedite resolution of this matter and we look forward to working with you on your payment review. Sincerely, -Craig W.

Also, attached in the e-mail below, I have included a ""Discussion Document"" that Mark and Pual put together for the purpose of discussions with Kennedy. It provides more specifics on the pricing and volume allocation, if you desire. Based on my calculations, the 10,000/d priced at NYMEX minus $0.62 is roughly $300,000 in the money and the 5,000/d priced at NGPL MidCon minus $0.47 is roughly $500,000 in the money.

"Paul, let's try to find some time on Friday to discuss next steps. BT -----Original Message----- From: Lucci, Paul T. Sent: Wednesday, September 19, 2001 4:22 PM To: Whitt, Mark; Tycholiz, Barry Subject: RE: Crestone Restructure Mark and Barry I have talked to Crestone about backing us in a Northern Border transportation deal. Basically they are on board, however I have not shown them any economics. What I believe needs to take place is to identify Northern Border shippers who would be willing to release their capacity. Once we are able to put the capacity release economics together, which will be driven by the Northern Border shippers, we will be able to show Crestone a deal. I do not have any potential parties willing to release Northern Border capacity. I have talked to the Central desk about this opportunity, they informed me that they had no interest in this type of an arrangement. I personally believe we can manage ENA's current Northern Border position more efficiently but have been unable to convince others of this. Any ideas you can provide would be helpful.
