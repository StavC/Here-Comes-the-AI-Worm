"The following basic assumptions concerning gas capacity requirements for the Fort Pierce project were confirmed today at a meeting attended by Dave Fairley, Ed McMichael, Ruth Concannon, Mark Breese, Eric Boyt, and Charlie Weldon. (NOTE: The heat rates and MW are subject to change pending final engineering evaluation. The intent of this note is to document the overall runtime assumptions.) 1) During the summertime months of May through September, the plant is expected to run 16 hours per day in a mode where Enron's 200 MW are dispatched as are Ft. Pierce's 82MW. 2) Enron will purchase summertime capacity only sufficient to allow running 200 MW for 16 hours per day at our ""bought-down"" heat rate of 6690. This equals 22,300 MMBTU/day and will allow for taking the full daily capacity in only a 16 hour period (6% per hour) The table below summarizes the monthly capacity requirements: MONTH Total Capacity Needed By Enron Ft.

"Thanks for the link. Sounds like they are doing well. I'm sure that it is due to our analysis and advice. I assume Mary has had her baby? How is everything? As for deer hunting, it's been really exciting as we've been seeing lots of young and middle aged bucks and a bumper crop of fawns for the first time in my memory of over 15 years of hunting there. I have not taken anythin but our hunters have gotten a 9, 10 and 11 point. The 10 point grossed 135 B&C swhich is not giant but a darn respectable deer anywhere in the US and outr third largest ever. (For calibration, mine grossed 166). I have one good 8 point that's about 18"" wide and 4.5 yeears old but I may let Weldon shoot him as he has not gotten a deer there in 6 years of hunting. I'm still open to you going there to take pictures. It may be hard to schedule but I really would not mind if you wanted to go down there and tkae some pics on your own. I've got one blind at which the feeders are close and the deer move nearly all day.

"Folks, This note is intended to update all who may be concerned on our progress toward developing a commercial hurricane warning derivative product or line of products. It is clear that numerous entities have underlying exposures to hurricane warning frequency and/or duration. It is our objective to develop derivative products that will enable these entities to effectively hedge this exposure. We have generated a partial brainstorm-style list of whom natural counterparties might be according to their underlying exposure: Pro-Hurricane Anti-Hurricane The Weather Channel Resorts Home Depot Cruise Ships Lowes Riverboat Casinos CNN Chemical Plants and Refineries Local TV Stations U.S Armed Forces Dry Ice Manufacturers Athletic Teams Chainsaw Manufacturers City Governments Insect Repellant Manufacturers State Governments It is obvious that there are numerous naturally offsetting parties but it is important to note that the pro-hurricane entities are more macro in nature while the anti-hurricane entities are typically more regional. Thus, we have documented the frequency and duration data by regional location with the thought that the anti-hurricane entities would be interested in regional products and the pro-hurricane entities would likely be more interested in bundled regional products depending on their exposure. Thus far, we have collected and documented all U.S hurricane warning data from 1980-2000 in the form of an Excel database. The data can be sorted by year, storm, or location on the U.S coastline.

"Hey Charlie: We received 2 quotes from EES for 2 different scenarios: If we run just winter months at the following load factor: January (80%), February (80%), March ( 80%), April (70%), May (60%), September (60%), October (70%), November (80%), and December (80%), the power cost is $0.060/kwhrs. On the other hand, if we run year round (including a 60% load factor during the three summer months) the power cost is $0.064/kwhrs. However, there is no call option value reflected in this scenario. EES is currently determining the call option value for the summer months. Please also review the attached spreadsheet for expected running hours. We are asumming that the compressor will run during the night, 8pm to 8am, when El Paso will be packing the line with gas.

On the other hand, if we run year round (including a 60% load factor during the three summer months) the power cost is $0.064/kwhrs. However, there is no call option value reflected in this scenario. EES is currently determining the call option value for the summer months. Please also review the attached spreadsheet for expected running hours. We are asumming that the compressor will run during the night, 8pm to 8am, when El Paso will be packing the line with gas.
