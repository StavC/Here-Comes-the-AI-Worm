With everything going on inside the company as well as in the world around us, we have been carefully considering whether a holiday celebration is appropriate this year. To be honest, employee feedback has been mixed. Many viewed the holiday party as a unique opportunity for us to come together as Enron employees to share the spirit of the season. Others felt a holiday party would be improper given the company's current circumstances. After weighing these points of view, we have ultimately decided to cancel the all-Enron holiday party that was scheduled for December 8. Given what has transpired over the past month, it could be considered imprudent for Enron to incur the expense of such an event. I regret that this action is necessary because I recognize that your hard work throughout the year merits a holiday celebration and so much more. We will attempt to find other, more appropriate ways to recognize your outstanding contributions as we move into the holiday season.

The Longhorns, ranked No. 7 in both polls, are 6-1, while the Tigers are unranked at 3-3. Missouri opened the season with a 20-13 loss to Bowling Green, then thumped Southwest Texas, 40-6, before getting mauled by Nebraska, 36-3. Then the Tigers beat Oklahoma State, 41-38, in a triple overtime, before losing to Iowa State, 20-14, and then outscoring Kansas 38-34. Tiger QB Kirk Farmer has had a hot hand in recent weeks, and he kept both teams in the game last week, blistering Kansas with 246 yards and three touchdowns passing, plus another 82 rushing yards. But he also had two interceptions run back for touchdowns. Farmer, a 6-5, 210-pound junior, has completed 73 of 147 passes for 804 yards and 8 touchdowns, but he was very productive in the Tigers' three most recent games. He also is a slippery runner who is a great scrambler. WR Justin Gage, a 6-5, 205-pound junior, is one of the nation's most productive pass receivers.

But don't worry about it. Coach Mack Brown wrote the book on recruiting and his previous four classes at Texas have been very good, and some of them have been great. This year's class has a chance to be as good as any Brown and his assistants have signed. There's a chance it could be the best of the bunch, even better than the top-rated Chris Simms, Cory Redding class. They already have 16 commitments, about half of them from players who have been on at least one national top 100 list, and their class already is ranked as one of the top five in the nation. Let's take a look at where they are and where they are going: OFFENSE Quarterback UT has a commitment from Billy Don Malone of Paris North Lamar, who is a lot better than most of the gurus think, and the Horns have close to a 50-50 shot at Vincent Young, the wonder kid at Houston Madison, who had his usual game Friday for the undefeated Marlins, doing everything on offense and even running an interception back for a touchdown.

On a day when upsets reigned across the country, particularly in the top 10, and five of the eight previously unbeaten teams lost, the Longhorns took care of business and ran their record to 7-1 overall and 4-1 in the Big 12. With Oklahoma's 20-10 loss at Nebraska, the Sooners, Longhorns and Aggies are all tied atop the standings in the Big 12 South. But the Longhorns have to win out and Oklahoma has to lose another conference game for the Longhorns to make it to the Big 12 Championship Game. Saturday's victory at Missouri was a fairly easy conquest, thanks to the stout UT defense and a great performance by the offensive line that allowed Simms to complete 24 of 30 passes (80%) for 229 yards and four touchdowns and Benson to run for 157 yards on 31 carries, an average of 5.1 yards a",clint.dean@enron.com,dgagliardi@reliantenergy.com,"'TruOrange@aol.com@ENRON' : 'email', 'TruOrange@aol.com' : 'email', 'Jerry Scarbrough' : 'person', 'Chris Simms' : 'person', 'Cedric Benson' : 'person'",5,"FW: True Orange, October 29, 2001, Part 1 of 3",1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,sent,clint.dean@enron.com

We had several hundred people at the tailgate, and by the middle of the 3rd quarter, I think the Texas fans outnumbered the Oklahoma Aggies. All I will say about the booming Metropolis of Stillwater is I'm glad we do not return for 2 years. Brutal. Absolutely brutal. 45-17 Texas looked a little sloppy early, but righted the ship to cruise on course. Oklahoma State had a solid game plan, but the Texas adjustments and superior talent overwhelmed the Cowboys. The running game re-appeared this week, and freshman stud-to-be Cedric Benson got his 1st career start. He did not disappoint. El Ced finished the day with 131 yards on 31 carries. His solid running opened up the passing lanes for Simms and Co., who picked apart the overmatched OSU secondary to the tune of 5 touchdown passes.
