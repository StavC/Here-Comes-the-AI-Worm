You are only about five miles from the hospital nearest your? home; unfortunately you don't know if you'll be able to make it that far.?? What can you do? You've been trained in CPR but the guy that taught the course neglected to tell you how to perform it on yourself. HOW TO SURVIVE A HEART ATTACK WHEN ALONE (Since many people are alone when they suffer a heart attack, this article seemed in order.) Without help, the person whose heart stops beating properly and who begins to feel faint, has only about 10 seconds left before losing consciousness.?

A deep breath should be taken before each cough, and the cough must be deep and prolonged, as when producing sputum from deep inside the chest. A breath and? a cough must be repeated about every two seconds without let up until help arrives, or until the heart is to be beating normally again.

"This is from my friend Jane in Texas - these phrases are pretty funny and I am sure we can all incorporate them into our everyday conversations! I am sending this only because I have actually heard several of these in conversation over the years. Come to think of it, Jack may have used some of these phrases. Subject: Whitehouse Language New language for the press corp and others at the White House to get used to. The White House is not just getting a new team, but a whole new language. George W. Bush will be bringing with him many friends from Texas, and for anyone not born in the Lone Star State, the Texan accent and the cowboy colloquialisms can seem a bit strange. Here is a guide to a few of the more colorful expressions they might encounter: 1. The engine's runnin' but ain't nobody driving = Not overly-intelligent 2. As welcome as a skunk at a lawn party (self-explanatory) 3. Tighter than bark on a tree = Not very generous 4. Big hat, no cattle = All talk and no action 5. We've howdied but we ain't shook yet = We've made a brief acquaintance, but not been formally introduced 6.

"Two sisters, one blonde and one brunette, inherit the family ranch. Unfortunately, after just a few years, they are in financial trouble. In order to keep the bank from repossessing the ranch, they need to purchase a bull so that they can breed their own stock. The brunette balances their checkbook, then takes their last $600 dollars out west to another ranch where a man has a prize bull for sale. Upon leaving, she tells her sister, ""When I get there, if I decide to buy the bull, I'll contact you to drive out after me and haul it home."" The brunette arrives at the man's ranch, inspects the bull, and decides she does want to buy it. The man tells her that he can sell it for $599, no less. After paying him, she drives to the nearest town to send her sister a telegram to tell her the news. She walks into the telegraph office, and says, ""I want to send a telegram to my sister telling her that I've bought a bull for our ranch. I need her to hitch the trailer to our pick-up truck and drive out here so we can haul it home."" The telegraph operator explains that he'll be glad to help her, then adds, It's just 99 cents a word."" Well, after paying for the bull, the brunette only has $1 left.
