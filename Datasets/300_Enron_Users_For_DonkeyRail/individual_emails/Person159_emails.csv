We publish LNG Express and the related website www.LNGExpress.com. LNG is a unique form of natural gas trade, representing some $20 billion per year and growing at 7-8%/year. The industry is a fairly insular community. Our publication, website, industry reports, databanks, annual conferences and consulting services have grown to be possibly the most visible. LNG has a growing spot and short-term contract market. There is currently no exchange for global trades. Nor is there an exchange for carrier vessel capacity, excess plant capacity, e-procurement or remote gas leases. LNGExpress.com could be platform for such an exchange with content and readers already established. We might also assist Enron sign up exclusive agreements with LNG suppliers and/or buyers. Please let me know your thoughts ASAP. I suspect this window of opportunity will close quickly.

Mike Richard Harper 06/07/2000 09:30 AM To: Mike McConnell/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: Subject: Re: J-Block I have not been involved, but only last week a little bird told me that they have severe problems with reserve levels and expect to decline in 2002, when we were talking it was 2004 and then only by a small amount. Agip is particularly adversely effected (as Agip in particular lacks reserves in the area). I understand the development of Jade by BG and Phillips and the squeeze down of Texaco and OMV, the other Jade owners, by Agip to sell their gas to Agip was driven by this lack of reserves. You will recall that liquidated damages was a big issue they wanted to retain them rather than actual damages and we insisted that they remained at the same absolute level as in the old agreement, so I believe they are 40% of the new price (my memory is fading also). I do recall that they all insisted that they would deliver the gas. However, as with most companies the players have all moved on and a contract is a contract, afterall this was our approach. Also I am sure they intended to maximise production from J-Block and did not forsee a shortage of production.

Jeff and I, along with Bill Donovan, would like to invite you to join us for a tour on this Friday morning, June 8th, from 8:30 to 9:30 a.m. Even if you have already had an opportunity to visit the new building, we think this would be a great opportunity for all of us to see the space together and discuss any issues at that time. Please contact Cathy Phillips at X-36898 if you plan to attend the tour. New building floor plan modification requests will no longer be accepted. Any change requests that have already been received are currently being considered and will be conveyed to the appropriate business unit head. If vacant positions exist and they will be filled before the move on August 3rd, they need to be identified on all reports and floor plans with their name, NH (for new hire) and an approximate hire date. Example: Bob Smith NH 7/25 Any space/move related questions or issues that may arise should be addressed by Cathy Phillips. Please do not contact Susan Lopez for any space related issues.

I continue to serve on the board of JDF representing Enron and will be Enron's corporate executive for this year's fundraising efforts.

Even though I know how difficult this disease can be to manage with the multiple finger pricks for blood samples and several shots each day, I cannot imagine how difficult it is for a small child with this disease. Taking insulin does not cure the disease nor prevent the development of complications; insulin is simply their life support system and without it they would die. Enron continues to be a major corporate sponsor for JDF again this year. JDF is a very efficient organization in which approximately 84% of all money raised goes directly to research.

"Dear Mike: Glad to hear from you. The Lichtenstein ""Composition No. 4"" is exactly like the one you saw except that it would be a different number in the signed and numbered edition. The price is $4,500.00. That is unframed. We can frame the artwork like the Liechtenstein you saw here or if you prefer like the Matisse. You have that option. I will contact the owner and send you an image either by e-mail or by mail. The window of opportunity to acquire the artwork is limited. I would love to talk to you personally about the Matisse ""Icarus"" artwork. When would be the best time to contact you and Chris? As I mentioned to you this artwork is hard to find and cannot be easily replaced. Please keep in mind that several of our consultants are working with clients and galleries to place this artwork.

"Yesterday's meeting in Bombay among OLNG, DPC and Denton Hall (OLNG's lawyer) went very well. DPC did a great job of describing the current situation in a balanced manner (yes, there are both positives and negatives). OLNG was pleased with the information they received. One concept that became apparent is that there may be two agendas within Oman----(a) OLNG's agenda, which is to cooperate to make the project a success, even if it involves some renegotiation and (b) Shell's agenda, which may be to force the project into default to create an opportunity for Shell to step in and take control of the only LNG terminal that will be built on the west coast of India in the foreseeable future. The Omani government is contemplating a visit to Delhi to initiate government-to-government talks to help sort this out. Dabhol is one of several projects that Oman had hoped would successfully build ties with India---and each of the projects has run into snags because India has not held up its end of the deal. I had seperate talks with Wade/Jim about the forward path within Enron. The three of us believe that DPC should consider either going short LNG or replacing at least a portion of its LNG contracts with an EGM supply contract, with EGM deciding what to do about coverage (i.e., short or long).

"Mike - I think we are doing a good job of isolating ourselves from the direct risk of owning synfuel machines. The equity owners are the ones at risk for any amendments to Section 29 of the tax code. Further, we have identified the ""Class A"" machines in the market, those with the strongest PLR 's, legal facts, and credit worthy owners, and have concentrated our activities on only those machines. We will be responsible for supplying coal to the machines, a short position we enjoy today with our term sales of equity coal to Florida Powers' synfuel group and traded coal to Sempra, and act as sales agent (obviously with obligations to sell) for the resultant synfuel. The deals we are currently negotiating with AIG and PacifiCorp are even more favorable then our Sempra deal in that we will not be acting as operator of the machines. We also expect to receive mark to market accounting treatment on the new deals. As point of reference we think AIG will be worth about $25 mm and PacifiCorp north of $50 mm. Although we have yet to mtm the Sempra deal, it is worth about $25 mm on a mtm basis. Between the above three deals we have over $100 mm of potential income this year. In addition we will enter into long term short positions with the machines, which will allow us to expand our physical flows, and continue to grow our business. As an example, this year we will deliver about 12 - 15 mm tons of eastern coal. If we successfully conclude the AIG and PacifiCorp deals, we will move an additional 11 - 13 mm tpy",george.mcclellan@enron.com,mike.mcconnell@enron.com,"'Mike' : 'person', 'Section 29' : 'tax identification number'",2,Re: Synfuel,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,received,mike.mcconnell@enron.com

"FYI---one of the many,many articles that have come out over the past few days. This one captures the essence of most of them. See in particular the part I have highlighted. General reaction in the business community is that Enron must be crazy to have worked this hard to beat the competition, only to withdraw just as the project becomes real. The phones continue to ring constantly. At the same time, we have just received the official notification from the Saudis that we have been awarded, after what is being described as ""fierce competition"", a piece of Core Venture 2. We have already wired this with Oxy and will exit this week in a manner that hopefully protects the relationships that we have built with the Saudis----but the timing (exactly the same time that we are withdrawing from Dolphin and filing a termination notice for Dabhol) does not help. As you might expect, the mood in the office is terrible----the team is proud of the fact that they started with nothing two years ago have accomplished the impossible against great odds (beating the competition in Dolphin, Saudi, SADAF and Oman, as well as putting together a world-class LNG supply system for Dabhol) only to have it all fall apart with what is perceived as limited redeployment potential and little PRC support because of the ""ex EI"" stigma.

(AP) _ Two senior executives will retire as part of a management restructuring at Eastman Chemical Co. coinciding with the division of the chemical and plastics giant into two separate companies by year's end. Eastman Chairman and CEO Earnest Deavenport Jr. said Tuesday that Dr. James L. Chitwood and Garland S. Williamson will follow him into retirement on Dec. 31. That is the date Eastman Chemical has set for its tax-free spinoff into two companies _ a specialty chemicals, coatings and adhesives company called Eastman Co., and a plastics and acetate fibers commodities company yet to be named.

"Good morning, Mike. What time is the meeting? Rosie To: Kenneth Lay/Corp/Enron@ENRON cc: Subject: EGM - all company meeting Ken, Per my voicemail, we are having an all employee meeting on next Monday at the Hyatt Regency. The purpose of this meeting is to pull everyone together for an update on EGM and a brief presentation from all the business units within EGM. This includes about 1 hour of business and then drinks and food - we expect about 500 people. We have made a lot of progress on changing the nature and profitability of these businesses and we want to make sure everyone sees just how far we have come in a few months. I believe they will be motivated to see the growth and profitability. We had a record Q1 with $100 million of gross margin. That was 50% of what they made in all of 2000. Combined with the fact that in December of 2000 alone we made $87 million in gross margin, I believe it will have a big impact. If you could attend the meeting even for a few minutes it would go a long way in helping us drive our other point which is that the EGM businesses are now core to Enron and has the attention of both you and Jeff. Thanks for considering this and let me know if you need any other information or assistance.
