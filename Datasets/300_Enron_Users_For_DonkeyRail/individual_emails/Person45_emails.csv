"Gentlemen, As we discussed in our meeting last week, attached is a proposal from ENSR to complete a desk top review which will identify scoping issues, summarizing permitting requirements, siting constraints, and routing issues (including NGO's, Native American issues, landowner activist groups, etc.). ENSR will furnish their findings in a report which will include a map review and fatal flaw analysis. The report can be completed within three weeks of the notice for ENSR to proceed and will cost approximately $8,500. I would propose that we place a ""not to exceed"" requirement on the cost and basically tell ENSR that we expect them to produce the work product for that sum. This report will greatly assist us in developing a successful environmental strategy for this major project. Under separate cover I will submitting to Steve Veatch a prospective time line for the completion of the ""Resource Reports"" to meet the F-I filing requirements. Let me know if you have any questions. I will wait on your approval before releasing ENSR to proceed.

There are two different types of compensation credits we will need to purchase: Coles Levee Ecopreserve (CLEP) credits, and Kern Water Bank (KWB) credits. For KWB, we will need 24 acres to start the project. From the figures I have been quoted, these should cost $62,000. This is only for installation of the new lines, however, and does not include acreage to cover removal of the existing line. (I will not here hazard a quess as to how many additional acres this will require, but it could well be that same amount again, as the lines are the same length.) The Enron folks can determine the actual number. For CLEP, we need 15.3 acres.

"Following our conference call this morning and the consensus we reached, I placed a call to Rod Boschee and we discussed the following items. One of the key points Rod made is summarized at bullet four below. Evidently, they want to take the maximum amount of gas from us for as long as they can. We appreciated his phone call and the cooperative effort that was working well. I told Rod that we were also very pleased with the results experienced since the June 29 cleaning and testing of the separators. As far as we knew TW's system was staying dry and we were moving no significant liquids into their separator. TW would go along with PG&E and agree that we would not take the system down in mid-September to re-check the separators at this point since we were not seeing any alarming numbers or quantities. In place of taking the system down in mid-September, TW and PG&E would watch for an upset and a large quantity or a higher concentration - if that occurs, then we would immediately get together and plan a time to take the system down and check things out. PG&E is requesting that TW keep flow rates up the rest of the summer, all fall and into the winter. PG&E might want us to take the system down and check the separators sometime next year - but they want to talk about going as long as we can before we do that. Rod agreed that we would still meet as planned in October in Las Vegas.

"Guys, A couple of things to consider as you make plans for the meeting (end of April to early May, 2002) in Flagstaff, AZ. You should probably take a rough count on attendees and confirm with the hotel there the meeting dates. You should factor in any meetings that might interfere in that time frame (i.e., Managers/Directors Meeting, etc.). Possibly Amelia Alder can tell you when any meetings like that might occur. If you don't reserve space at the Little America (example: the time slot, meeting room and 60 hotel rooms, etc.) - you may find yourself blocked out by a convention or some other gathering that has the hotel booked. Also, you should check with Kim Ladish to make sure Randy does not have any blockage for the dates you select. Before you know it the time slots will fill up for guys like Randy. Also, I would approve and supply funding for your conservative purchase of some gift item from the Signature Shop (with Enron logo) for the attendees to take away from the meeting (enough to share with our SW Operating Partners that will join us for the second day of the meeting). We can discuss what will be appropriate. A little planning ahead may save you some headaches later on, especially if you don't tie down the hotel space you will need for the meeting. I believe you will have to get pre-approval from the Enron group that has to approve a meeting of this magnitude.

I will be setting a meeting with her (probably at her office or wherever she keeps all of the records, maps, etc. on the preserve), so she might brief me on the NCLP and the restrictions that she believes EOTT is operating under with the HCP.

I may give him a call and see who he recommends that I call in California to get the inside scoop on the North Coles Levee Preserve. (3) I will make several other calls gathering information.

"Following our conference call this morning and the consensus we reached, I placed a call to Rod Boschee and we discussed the following items. One of the key points Rod made is summarized at bullet four below. Evidently, they want to take the maximum amount of gas from us for as long as they can. We appreciated his phone call and the cooperative effort that was working well. I told Rod that we were also very pleased with the results experienced since the June 29 cleaning and testing of the separators. As far as we knew TW's system was staying dry and we were moving no significant liquids into their separator. TW would go along with PG&E and agree that we would not take the system down in mid-September to re-check the separators at this point since we were not seeing any alarming numbers or quantities. In place of taking the system down in mid-September, TW and PG&E would watch for an upset and a large quantity or a higher concentration - if that occurs, then we would immediately get together and plan a time to take the system down and check things out. PG&E is requesting that TW keep flow rates up the rest of the summer, all fall and into the winter. PG&E might want us to take the system down and check the separators sometime next year - but they want to talk about going as long as we can before we do that.

No need for the one call system to be used for retired gas lines. Eliminates the generation of potentially hazardous waste water created by the rinsing method of abandonment.

"Larry, I hope you have been reading the emails below related to the NCLP in which the Bakersfield plant is located. I think ""Ed"" (the EOTT lawyer) has realized that he's not going to ""buffalo me"" on any of these issues and will begin to openly share information and support my decision making on what we might be able to do there proactively. Some things I will be doing are: (1) calling Randi McCormick the CWB in California who reportedly has more knowledge about the NCLP than anyone else. I will be setting a meeting with her (probably at her office or wherever she keeps all of the records, maps, etc. on the preserve), so she might brief me on the NCLP and the restrictions that she believes EOTT is operating under with the HCP. (2) I am placing calls to the Nature Conservancy in California to see what they know about the preserve (incidentally, the Steven McCormick, executive director of the California Chapter of TNC has been named the new President of the Nature Conservancy, succeeding the late John Sawhill). I may give him a call and see who he recommends that I call in California to get the inside scoop on the North Coles Levee Preserve. (3) I will make several other calls gathering information. You need to: (1) begin talking with Scott Jones and Rick Sudderman to learn all you can from their perspective about the easement and the preserve.

"Gentlemen, As you are aware, David Roensch, Larry Campbell and I just traveled to Penn State University and had a lengthy meeting with Dr. Adawaumi. This meeting was mainly related to obtaining an update on exactly where they were in progressing with the PCB Behavioral and Hydrodynamic Model for TW's Pipeline System. For your reference I have attached to this note what I consider to be the key points from that meeting. I hope you will take a few moments and review the attachment. I will be glad to discuss any questions you might have. Based on what we learned during the meeting with Dr. Adawaumi, I am recommending that we have a meeting in the near future to discuss what the appropriate next steps should be related to whether or not we enter into Phase II (which would include cleaning an actual segment of TW's system) of this process. My Secretary will be contacting you in the next few days to establish a time when you would be available for such a meeting (4 hours is needed). For this meeting, Dr. Adawaumi will be asked to come down from PSU to make about a one hour presentation related to his findings and recommendations at this point.

"Eric, As we discussed, with ENSR's assistance I have developed a projected timeline for developing the FERC required F-1 Exhibit (12 part Resource Reports to satisfy the NEPA requirement) in sufficient detail to meet the FERC filing requirements and expedite the processing of the environmental portion of the application. The aggressive timeline assumes that the expedited FERC ""Collaborative Approach"" will be implemented throughout the processing of the application. Even with the ""Collaborative Approach"" and all of the upfront work done with the environmental community to streamline the processing, the schedule is very, very optimistic and assumes that all conflicting issues will be resolved quickly and the processing continue. I have requested that Jon Schmidt (ENSR) begin working on a detailed cost estimate, by quarters in two phases. The first part of the estimate would be to project the environmental cost, by quarters of preparing the 12 Resource Reports (including the necessary field work) that would get Sun Devil to an FERC filing in the first quarter of 2002 that would not be rejected. The second component of the cost estimate would be to complete the field work and permitting phases during the processing of the application. This includes participating in FERC scoping meetings and agency meetings as required. This would include assisting the third party environmental contractor in working on the EIS to expedite the writing as needed.

"The third quarter PCB meeting with Southern California Gas Company was held this morning. SoCal presented a third quarter invoce of their PCB management and disposal activities for which Transwestern is responsible for $120,602.19 (86%). All charges were appropriate and considered normal operating expenses for PCB activities in California. On a similar note, while speaking to Ralph Komai, PCB person for SoCal, some interesting things are happening on their system and are presented below: SoCal is beginning to notice accumulations of PCB pipeline liquids on portions of their system which has been considered PCB clean. It is these portions of their pipeline for which they have been petitioning EPA to declassify. These liquids are not new liquids introductions into the SoCal system but historic liquids that have laid in their pipeline. Because of the fact that Transwestern is not seeing liquids accumulations at the compressor stations upstream of Needles, we know that liquids are not being sent inot California. Due to the increase of Transwestern gas into the SoCal system, it appears the gas is sweeping old historic liquids into these new pipeline areas. SoCal will be meeting with PG&E within the next couple of weeks to discuss the discovery of pipeline liquids at an interconnect where SoCal provides natural gas to PG&E.The PCB concentrations are less than 5 ppm.

"I obtained a copy of a letter sent to Gary Fuller from the Department of Fish and Game on November 3, 2000. In the letter the Fish and Game agreed EOTT has 41 Acres of conservation credits based on Arco Western Energy's sale of the North Coles Levee fractionator plant and premises to Koch Oil and Gas, and Koch's subsequent sale of the plant and premises to EOTT ENERGY. In the letter the following limitations and clarifications were listed: Because the conservation credits may be used for mitigation of EOTT impacts, or sold by EOTT to third parties for their own mitigation needs, EOTT must affirm that it will conform to the Department's standards for sale of conservation credits as well as management of the credit lands. These obligations are already implied by the chain of Koch's and then EOTT's acquisitions of the North Coles Levee fractionator plant. EOTT and Department representatives will need to meet to discuss these details and determine the most efficient means to implement these conditions. Key provision of the obligations that attend using the conservation credits include Department approval of third-party sales; minimum endowment requirements for all credit sales; management and monitoring of habitat conditions; and additional mitigation for disturbance to dedicated habitat. Habitat continuity and small animal movement between the North Coles fractionator plant site and the remainder of Coles Levee Ecosystem Preserve must be provided in order to maintain viability of the habitat within EOTT's holdings.

"John, I had asked Randi to complete an annual report for the F&G 2081 permit, as I did not want to have this hang over our head when EOTT's 2081 application was reviewed. This may be the annual report that were talking about. As you remember, the 2081 requires an annual report for activities conducted for the prior year and it is due by Jan 10th of every year. It was not been submitted for 1999 or 2000. Because Randi has been personally involved in all construction activities at the North Coles Levee facility, I thought she would be the prime person to complie the reports for us and then we would submit. If this is the annual report everyone is talking about, then, yes, I instructed her to do these, primarily, because she has been involved since the get go and she has the information.

"John some quick thoughts on agenda items for the meeting with PG&E: 1. Status of the mini filter separator installations at PG&E interconnect/delivery/receipt points? Future thoughts/plans for additional separator installations. 2. PG&E customer attitudes about potential PCB introduced into their equipment. Any new customers with positive hits of PCBs? 3. Internal sampling activities. How far have PCB's spread into the PG&E system. (wipe tests results versus liquids collections). A map would be nice depicting this. 4. Transwestern continues to be pretty much dry on mainline and extremely dry on the Topock lateral. Maybe we should have a little presentation showing liquids collected in the last year on the mainline and Topock lateral. Our commitment to keeping the PCBs as immobile as possible. 5. We might consider sharing what we've learned from our PCB modeling study with Penn State and what our future plans are. Another Tranwestern effort to show our commitment. John, if we plan on opening up our separator, has a decision been made to decon it or just clean out the hydrocarbon buildup and replace the filters. If we do decide to decon our separator and or theirs, we will need to line out a contractor to be onsite when we blow down the systems. Id like to discuss possibly not using Vector for this type of routene activity any longer. There is a company in Farmington, NM (Riley) that can probably do the job.

"John, I was just thinking that if this deconning becomes a routene activity for us and PG&E, we might want to consider breaking in a company that is less expensive, can more quickly mobilize and get the same quality work product. Vector, has to travel from Ohio. Deconning the separators becomes an internal washing job of the vessel. I will discuss this with Tiny about possibly using someone else. Tiny, do you think Riley would be interested in tackling this issue for us and PG&E? As you know, they do not have a deconning permit from the EPA, but with the new PCB rules in place, a permit is not necessary anymore to do deconning activities. How do you think PG&E will respond to us possibly using another contractor other than Vector for the work. I suppose we can bring this issue up in Flagstaff.

"John some quick thoughts on agenda items for the meeting with PG&E: 1. Status of the mini filter separator installations at PG&E interconnect/delivery/receipt points? Future thoughts/plans for additional separator installations. 2. PG&E customer attitudes about potential PCB introduced into their equipment. Any new customers with positive hits of PCBs? 3. Internal sampling activities. How far have PCB's spread into the PG&E system. (wipe tests results versus liquids collections). A map would be nice depicting this. 4. Transwestern continues to be pretty much dry on mainline and extremely dry on the Topock lateral. Maybe we should have a little presentation showing liquids collected in the last year on the mainline and Topock lateral. Our commitment to keeping the PCBs as immobile as possible. 5. We might consider sharing what we've learned from our PCB modeling study with Penn State and what our future plans are. Another Tranwestern effort to show our commitment. John, if we plan on opening up our separator, has a decision been made to decon it or just clean out the hydrocarbon buildup and replace the filters. If we do decide to decon our separator and or theirs, we will need to line out a contractor to be onsite when we blow down the systems. Id like to discuss possibly not using Vector for this type of routene activity any longer. There is a company in Farmington, NM (Riley) that can probably do the job.

"The State Take Permit and the Consevation Easement were mailed yesterday. Please let me know if you don't receive them by Friday. You are quite right that the State Permit covers only state rare, threatened and endangered species. However, with the sole exception of the San Joaquin Antelope Squirrel (which is state listed only), all state listed animal species are federally listed as well. (Though the lists are virtually identical, the ""rankings"" on each list are not; that is, a species considered ""endangered"" by the state may only be considered ""threatened"" by the feds, and vice-versa,etc.) Listed species of plant, on the other hand, are not the same federally and state. Plus, there indeed are species of concern within the easement that are not yet listed. Randi McCormick has some pretty comprehensive listings on both of these points (that is, lists of federally and state rare, threatened and endangered species of plants; and species of concern.) I'll have her send info on this to you. Lastly, I don't have a contact with the State Database folks, and I don't think we've ever dealt with them. I apologize if I seemed argumentative about Kenny -- I wasn't meaning to be. I just wanted you to understand how and why that designation came about.

Concerning the agenda, the first day is devoted to presentations. The second moring will be devoted to a ""surprise"" participation at a local compressor station about 45 miles west of Albuquerque. I havent spread this around yet, except to Rich Jolly and got his OK, but I plan on dividing the guys into groups of 2 and having them conduct an investigation/audit of the compressor station. I plan on setting and hiding some placebo environmental issues the night before at the station to see if they can discover them and other housekeeping issues the next morning during the audit. We will then convine back at the hotel in the afternoon to discuss what they found and how they would address the issues identified. The group that identifies the most issues, will get a small gift. Do I need your approval on the spending of some $$$ for a gift? I was thinking of a couple of $25 gift certificates for the two winners at a big sporting goods store and let them choose what they want.

It is these portions of their pipeline for which they have been petitioning EPA to declassify. These liquids are not new liquids introductions into the SoCal system but historic liquids that have laid in their pipeline. Because of the fact that Transwestern is not seeing liquids accumulations at the compressor stations upstream of Needles, we know that liquids are not being sent inot California. Due to the increase of Transwestern gas into the SoCal system, it appears the gas is sweeping old historic liquids into these new pipeline areas. SoCal will be meeting with PG&E within the next couple of weeks to discuss the discovery of pipeline liquids at an interconnect where SoCal provides natural gas to PG&E.The PCB concentrations are less than 5 ppm. The location of this interconnect is near Bakersfield, Ca. Southwest Gas has requested that 2 filter separators be installed at 2 interconnects where they",larry.campbell@enron.com,john.shafer@enron.com,"'Ralph Komai' : 'person', 'Bakersfield, Ca.' : 'address'",2,"FYI, PCB mtg with SoCal",1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,received,john.shafer@enron.com
"John some quick thoughts on agenda items for the meeting with PG&E: 1. Status of the mini filter separator installations at PG&E interconnect/delivery/receipt points? Future thoughts/plans for additional separator installations. 2. PG&E customer attitudes about potential PCB introduced into their equipment. Any new customers with positive hits of PCBs? 3. Internal sampling activities. How far have PCB's spread into the PG&E system. (wipe tests results versus liquids collections). A map would be nice depicting this. 4. Transwestern continues to be pretty much dry on mainline and extremely dry on the Topock lateral. Maybe we should have a little presentation showing liquids collected in the last year on the mainline and Topock lateral. Our commitment to keeping the PCBs as immobile as possible. 5. We might consider sharing what we've learned from our PCB modeling study with Penn State and what our future plans are. Another Tranwestern effort to show our commitment. John, if we plan on opening up our separator, has a decision been made to decon it or just clean out the hydrocarbon buildup and replace the filters. If we do decide to decon our separator and or theirs, we will need to line out a contractor to be onsite when we blow down the systems. Id like to discuss possibly not using Vector for this type of routene activity any longer. There is a company in Farmington, NM (Riley) that can probably do the job. As you know, this decon work is not rocket science and Vector is $$$$$$$, although they do ",larry.campbell@enron.com,john.shafer@enron.com,"'John' : 'person', 'John' : 'person'",2,RE: Flagstaff Trip Rescheduled for July 24 - 26th,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,received,john.shafer@enron.com
