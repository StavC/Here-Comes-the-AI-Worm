This is driven by the fact that the RTO efforts have focused on the scheduling needs internal to their borders. The problem the Electronic Scheduling Collaborative (ESC) faces is trying to define standard business practices for OASIS II now - after most RTOs have taken great steps to defining their own internal scheduling practices. In the West, there is a coordination effort to address the seams between the 3 RTOs (there are some in theEast as well). FERC required in Order 2000, under Function 8, for RTOs to address seams issues. At the ESC workshop last week, several RTOs admitted that Function 8 is lowest on their list of priorities. Several, includig a rep from the West admitted that the real hard seams issues, those that cannot be patched, will likely need FERC involvement to ""force"" a compromise or settlement. The problem is that FERC is taking a light handed approach to the seams problems with acting Chairman Hebert opting to rely on the RTOs themselves to address the seams",cara.semperger@enron.com,"sean.crandall@enron.com, diana.scholtes@enron.com, mark.fischer@enron.com,

"I am working in the target date of June 20th. Today I added schedules from Palo Verde and the entire MidC sheet to the testing group. Once COB is added, we will have pretty much an average daily volume. Here is my attached worksheet for Mid C In Preschedule Workspace: I added Palo Verde to the group of deals imported, and ran a total of 37 lines into the Path confirmation. The rest of the sheet was all bookouts, and so I marked them for routing only. I do like the feature of being able to exlude the majority of deals from the path confirmation. This will make the app much faster and less cumbersome for Real Time and Settlements. I would like the option of printing the error sheet when it comes up, as the lists can be long, and I have to make notes on what is wrong. Also being able to check for errors before running the sheet would save us lots of time. We currently have a function that checks that all names are recognized before the sheet is imported to paths. This would give us the opportunity of correction before running the sheet, instead of cleaning up afterwards. Routing functionality question: If we change a delivery point in scheduling (BPA NW delivered gets moved and changed every day), do these changes not route because the deal entry strip has the original delivery point? These types of deals route now, I would like to duplicate that existing functionality. I did get an error message on those lines, ""Capability not supported: deal has multiple delivery points"" Please see",cara.semperger@enron.com,"asem.atta@enron.com, will.smith@enron.com",'I' : 'person',1,"Continuing testing of Preschedule Workspace, Path Confirmation and

Last week we offered a hands on training of our new Customer Web Interface (CWI). At this time there are no plans to offer additional training sessions. Our current plan is to have one or two customer meetings the week of 9/17 where we will train a large group (no hands on). The CWI is out on our web site for customers to review and play with now (test version). The following URL should take you directly to the test site. If you put the cursor over the word scheduling you'll see the link to ""Transmission and Demand Scheduling"". http://taim-test.transmission.bpa.gov/taim/ If you go out and test it (make sure to print out the User Guide) that will provide you with an opportunity to do some self-training prior to the September session(s). The final date for the CWI customer meeting will be posted on our OASIS. I would encourage you to sign up for the e-mail exploder for updates on future CWI meetings (and all TBL business practices). Also, the CWI is still a work in progress so newer versions are being loaded from time to time.",diana.scholtes@enron.com,cara.semperger@enron.com,"'Holden-Baker, Susan' : 'person'",1,"FW: Bonneville Power Administration Transmission Customer Web

After about five minutes the old man farts again and says, ""Touchdown, I'm ahead 14 to 7."" Not to be out done the wife rips another one and says, ""Touchdown, tie score."" Five seconds go by and she lets out a squeaker and says, ""Field goal, I lead 17 to 14.""

"Hello. How's life? Mine is pretty good. I have a face to face interview with Merch Pharmaceuticals. I guess I did ok on the phone interview even though I didn't think they'd call me back. Question for you. I was wondering if you could change the first sentence in my letter of recommendation because it talks about FMLA leave and the dates I worked at Enron, which I have on my resume, but I'd rather they didn't know that I have a little one because I don't want them to judge me by that.. or think I'll be a slacker because I won't, and I already have the same babysitter set up and ready to go. (if I get lucky and get the job)... :) I could come by one afternoon this week to pick it up because my interview is Tuesday. What do you think? No big deal if not, just thought I'd try. Also, I'm taking Emily to Gymboree (a baby class) and Chris Calgar's(spelling???) wife and son are in it. I just met her Tuesday for the first time. I guess they are moving to Houston the end of March. Hope all is well and maybe we'll see you soon. Emily is such a chunk now.

"I think that sounds like a great idea. It doesn't really serve a purpose to have all the time zones as a choice in Deal Blotter if EnPower is going to sort them out anyway. We're just doubling up on the work that the application already knows how to do. In the meantime, I'll sort through these deal numbers and change time zones that flow over the first week in April. Let me know if that sounds good. Kate Cara Semperger 03/26/2001 11:01 AM To: Kate Symes/PDX/ECT@ECT cc: Subject: Re: More deals found by Will Smith Yep, the time zone glitch. I think he was looking at all deals in the system. I almost think we should deal with this April, and worry about the rest when it comes up. Will and I are also kicking around making the only choice in deal entry PPT. Let Enpower sort out the rest. We can modify stuff on the strip level, but PPT would be the only choice in blotter and at the top of regular deal entry.
