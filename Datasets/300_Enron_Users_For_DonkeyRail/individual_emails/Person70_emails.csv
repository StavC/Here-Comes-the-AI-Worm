Enron Energy Services, peoples and others filed comments. Based on the comments, Staff circulated a proposed rule but there was no immediate follow-up. The Commission issued a notice indicating that it would further review the matter after its January, 2000 gas policy meeting. Thereafter, in August, 2000, the ICC Staff submiited a Report recommending that a rule be adopted. On Sept. 22, 2000, the rule was published for ""first notice"" in the Illinois Register. The ICC also initiated Docket 00-0586 to review the rules. In Docket 00-0586, the assigned Hearing Examiner determined that no hearings would be held to review the rules. As a result, only written comments were considered. Several parties (including Peoples/North Shore) filed comments (although Enron did not).

Springer"" <bjspringer@JonesDay.com> on 03/13/2001 09:48:38 AM To: gregg.penman@enron.com, kay.mann@enron.com cc: Subject: Master Sales Jerry Fox called to tell me that a decision has been made to by Peoples to withdraw the Petitions for Approval of the PGL and North Shore Master Sales Agreements. Jerry says this has been discussed with Enron. According to Jerry, the intent is to proceed with some of the transactions contemplated by the Agreement under exceptions to the affilliated interest approval requirements. (As you may recall, we discussed the possibility that some PGL/North Shore-enovate transactions may be expempt from the approval requirement before the Peitition was filed. ) At this early stage of the approval filing, the ICC Staff has not submitted testimony explaining its opposition to approval. From the Staff's data requests, however, it appears that they are not convinced that there is sufficient customer (i.e., public) benefit from establishing a contract between a utility and an affiliated entity to perform the transactions contemplated by the Master Sales Agreement when Peoples/North Shore acknowledge in the Petition that there are other contracts in place with non-affiliates to perfrom the same type of transactions.

"Some thoughts, observations, suggestions: 1. Advantages to the single contract: Don't need a consolidation agreement, so we don't have to negotiate one. Better from a liability standpoint. Easier to administer. Is there any reason we can't go with a single contract? 2. Repayment/prepayment I'm working with Steve on the letter agreement. 3. Assignment to Mitsui Steve is confirming payment issues, and ability to comply with GE's requested payment within 3 days of executing the contract. This means that the assignment and assumption needs to be executed contemporaneously with the GE contract. I have a call in to Rob Stevens to verify, in Stan's absence. Peggy is checking on this, also. 4. Parent guaranty. GE is requesting an Enron parent guaranty. From a quick review of the draft contract, it appears that a change in language will be necessary, since the current version only requires a parent guaranty in the case of an assignment to a certain class of assignees. If I am correct, then I suggest consider inserting new language that the parent guaranty will be due 30 days after execution of the contract, so that Mitsui can provide the guaranty, if necessary.

"Nothing fatal. Here are some thoughts/comments on the AMA for your general consideration: 2.2 (d) Bank accounts/bookkeeping. I've previously been advised that Corp performs this function. Issues which arise: will the money be invested overnight, who has signature authority, etc. We have a draft services agreement prepared for Peoples which can serve as a ""go by"" if you decide you need a separate doc. 2.2 (b)Billing/collection. Responsibility generally should stop at sending nastygrams. No duty to hire lawyers, etc. 2.2 (f) Insurance. In Texas, you have to have licenses to buy/sell insurance and adjust claims. Current language may be soft enough to not violate licensing laws. 2.2 (g) cost of filing for licenses and permits not included in defn of Marketing Expenses, but there's some catch all language that might help. 2.3 Accountants may like it to be clear that we can't hire/fire O & M contractor, set O & M policies, or dispatch plant. 3.2 If there are multiple transactions in a short period, these may be captured in one document, not one document for each transaction. It would be helpful if the EEIM for use with others explains our agency role. (may be in there - didn't review a copy) Is the Owner a power marketer yet?

If I deciphered this correctly, this is going to be what I would call an ""autoborrow"" facility ... Enovate's cash flow is swept into an account. Each day: (i) if Enovate's cash position is short (and availability remains under the loan agreements) advances are made under each loan agreement (probably directly into the acount), and (ii) if Enovate's position is long, the positive balance of the account is applied towards the outstanding loan balances, if any. We'll need to get minimum target amounts (i.e., do you really want them paying down $1.00 of each loan?) from the business people. Based on the foregoing, I suspect that these will be single-lender, prime rate based loan agreements (otherwise it would be a huge operational headache).

Dispatching Clarksdale assets under these circumstances is known as the first contingency must run condition. During first contingency must run conditions, EPMI will document the production costs, megawatts generated, duration of the event, and lost opportunity cost of buying from the market.
