Janet, I wanted to drop you a quick note. Things have been progressing nicely between the LNG guys and Southern Company. The LNG guys asked me if ENA needed to get some MTM from Elba, they would be willing to quicken the pace on putting a deal together. Probably rushing is not in the best interest of Enron buy it could be done. Anyhow, I have legal and structuring working on this and we may need you to help negotiate a transfer price between ENA and Enron Global at some point. I think no matter what happens prospectvely at Elba, Southern Co has probably saved the LNG group up to $50MM of capital clean up their off spec gas along with provided a much better price of Hub +$.12 vs our current put option of Hub + $.02 with El Paso which is an additional $36.5 MM improvement.

As indicated then, over the past couple of months I have been building a relationship the Sr. VP /Head of Product Development of Wells Fargo Capital Markets Group in SF. His mandate is to broaden the bank's capital markets capabilities. In the hopes of achieving this, he has asked me to explore (with him) potential areas where Wells and Enron could benefit from some sort of strategic relationship with Enron i.e. bringing commodity, weather, credit, etc. risk management capabilities to their broad corporate client base. Mark has suggested to me that he would welcome the opportunity to join me (EnronCredit.com) in representing the weather desk to Wells Fargo and exploring any potential strategic relationship with them. Do you have any interest in presenting Wells with Enron Global Market's full trading/risk management capabilities? If you do not on any organised basis, would you just I speak to the desk heads on an individual basis to explore their interest?

To clarify my discussion with you last week, while Gary's oversight is a key part of the deal I am uncomfortable with Gary's comments to Chris that I have simply introduced the deal and that Gary will make the sole decision on this deal. Jeff, these guys have been introduced to me on a personal basis and the discussions are based on a large element of trust. I see the strongest potential for this project working under the SPV structure outlined in our discussions. More importantly, I see a unique opportunity to develop the trading technology in a setting removed from the typical structure (but not from controls). To this end, I do not see the SPV reporting directly to Gary nor do I see viability of this project residing solely with Gary. I will call you Monday to discuss the way forward including the final due diligence required to move forward or kill this project.

Lisa Yoho passed on your questions about the Bush Energy Plan and opportunities for EGM, so I thought I'd outline a few from Lisa Jacobson's and my perspective. Many of the recommendations in the Energy Plan are very broad and could take months (if not years) to approve. However, there are certainly a few areas where EGM could find more immediate opportunity, or where we could weigh in to make the longer-term components of the plan beneficial to Enron. Short-term opportunities $2 billion over ten years for Clean Coal Technologies: There may be opportunities to pursue R&D funding, pilot projects, or tax incentives for technologies such as NOx Tech. While the bulk of this money could take several years to approve, there is ""clean coal"" program money available now for FY 2002, and DOE is already structuring programs for 2003 money. I have already discussed this briefly with the Clean Energy Solutions folks, but we have good contacts at DOE and they are very anxious to work with Enron, as they see us as a company who can help make the most of their R&D money because we are serious about moving technologies to market. Climate Change R&D: Any financial support the government puts toward climate change R&D could likely also be utilized for new generation/control technologies, but this would be a longer-term opportunity.

"I'd be interested to see who else is sponsoring the conference and who the other panelists would be. Since it is a first year conference, the success of it is highly dependent on the people who are pulling it together. Since the deadline on the sponsorship form is Sept. 8, they should be able to give us an indication of other participants. Do you want me to call Suresh to find out - he's been emailing me every other day about how interested he is in working for EBS anyway. The timing of it is good - the week after everyone comes for Super Saturday. I'd also be interested in what Tom says. I'd only do a Gold sponsorship - I don't think we need or want to be on more than 1 panel - either the corporate finance or sales and trading.

"Jeff, Good to see you in New York last week at the Guggenheim -- I enjoyed your company at the dinner. Lisa Yoho passed on your questions about the Bush Energy Plan and opportunities for EGM, so I thought I'd outline a few from Lisa Jacobson's and my perspective. Many of the recommendations in the Energy Plan are very broad and could take months (if not years) to approve. However, there are certainly a few areas where EGM could find more immediate opportunity, or where we could weigh in to make the longer-term components of the plan beneficial to Enron. Short-term opportunities $2 billion over ten years for Clean Coal Technologies: There may be opportunities to pursue R&D funding, pilot projects, or tax incentives for technologies such as NOx Tech. While the bulk of this money could take several years to approve, there is ""clean coal"" program money available now for FY 2002, and DOE is already structuring programs for 2003 money. I have already discussed this briefly with the Clean Energy Solutions folks, but we have good contacts at DOE and they are very anxious to work with Enron, as they see us as a company who can help make the most of their R&D money because we are serious about moving technologies to market.

Several new initiatives being proposed to Continental include the following: exchanging call options on crude oil for airline tickets (Craig Breslau, Originator) transacting financial swaps on line (Larry Gagliardi, Originator) creating a weather derivative product for the airline industry (Mark Tawney and Gary Taylor, Originators) outsourcing Continental's antifreeze and plastics risks by hedging these products with Enron (Alan Engberg, Originator) Meeting Attendees from Continental Airlines: Ron Howard, Vice President, Food Services Larry Kellner, Chief Financial Officer Greg Hartford, Vice President, Fuel Management Company Jeff Misner, Vice President and Treasurer (tentative) Meeting Attendees from Enron: Jeff Shankman, President and COO, Enron Global Markets John Nowlan, Vice President, Enron Global Markets Craig",sarah-joy.hunter@enron.com,jeffrey.shankman@enron.com,"'Mr. Shankman' : 'person', 'Larry Kellner' : 'person', 'Mr. Shankman' : 'person', 'Craig Breslau' : 'person', 'Larry Gagliardi' : 'person', 'Mark Tawney' : 'person', 'Gary Taylor' : 'person', 'Alan Engberg' : 'person', 'Ron Howard' : 'person', 'Larry Kellner' : 'person', 'Greg Hartford' : 'person', 'Jeff Misner' : 'person', 'Jeff Shankman' : 'person', 'John Nowlan' : 'person'",14,"Continental Briefing for Enron/Continental meeting December 12th

Several new initiatives being proposed to Continental include the following: exchanging call options on crude oil for airline tickets (Craig Breslau, Originator) transacting financial swaps on line (Larry Gagliardi, Originator) creating a weather derivative product for the airline industry (Mark Tawney and Gary Taylor, Originators) outsourcing Continental's antifreeze and plastics risks by hedging these products with Enron (Alan Engberg, Originator) Meeting Attendees from Continental Airlines: Ron Howard, Vice President, Food Services Larry Kellner, Chief Financial Officer Greg Hartford, Vice President, Fuel Management Company Jeff Misner, Vice President and Treasurer (tentative) Meeting Attendees from Enron: Jeff Shankman, President and COO, Enron Global Markets John Nowlan, Vice President, Enron Global Markets Craig",sarah-joy.hunter@enron.com,jeffrey.shankman@enron.com,"'Mr. Shankman' : 'person', 'Larry Kellner' : 'person', 'Mr. Shankman' : 'person', 'Craig Breslau' : 'person', 'Larry Gagliardi' : 'person', 'Mark Tawney' : 'person', 'Gary Taylor' : 'person', 'Alan Engberg' : 'person', 'Ron Howard' : 'person', 'Larry Kellner' : 'person', 'Greg Hartford' : 'person', 'Jeff Misner' : 'person', 'Jeff Shankman' : 'person', 'John Nowlan' : 'person'",14,"Continental Briefing for Enron/Continental meeting December 12th

You and Jeff talks about a senior position for me. What do you mean by that and what will Joe's position be. Will he still be the ""president"" or will he take a more active role on the origination side. What will Jeremy's role be. Today he does all these senior structuring deals with EGM products. Focus. There are very many commodities to look at here but since we have limited resources at this stage we need some focus in the beginning. If we look at everything at once - nothing will happen.

"Jeff, Good to see you in New York last week at the Guggenheim -- I enjoyed your company at the dinner. Lisa Yoho passed on your questions about the Bush Energy Plan and opportunities for EGM, so I thought I'd outline a few from Lisa Jacobson's and my perspective. Many of the recommendations in the Energy Plan are very broad and could take months (if not years) to approve. However, there are certainly a few areas where EGM could find more immediate opportunity, or where we could weigh in to make the longer-term components of the plan beneficial to Enron. Short-term opportunities $2 billion over ten years for Clean Coal Technologies: There may be opportunities to pursue R&D funding, pilot projects, or tax incentives for technologies such as NOx Tech. While the bulk of this money could take several years to approve, there is ""clean coal"" program money available now for FY 2002, and DOE is already structuring programs for 2003 money. I have already discussed this briefly with the Clean Energy Solutions folks, but we have good contacts at DOE and they are very anxious to work with Enron, as they see us as a company who can help make the most of their R&D money because we are serious about moving technologies to market. Climate Change R&D: Any financial support the government puts toward climate change R&D could likely also be utilized for new generation/control technologies, but this would be a longer-term opportunity.
