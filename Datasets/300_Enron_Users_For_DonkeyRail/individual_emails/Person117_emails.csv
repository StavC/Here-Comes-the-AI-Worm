"Yo! Yes, I believe your typical campells will have little mushroom pieces in it. And kmart would be a good place to buy a pyrex dish (glass baking)....of course you could borrow any supplies from me any time. Are you cooking up some grub for a lil lady??? I heard you all had a great time. Saw the pic of you that john said you ""woke up"" for at the brewery. Maybe we all can get together for a brew before john and i are off for alaska on sunday. we will be gone for a week and a half. Maybe friday after work. Let me know if you have any other cooking q's.

This is the lifestyle he has always led since college. To settle down and lay roots somewhere is something that I know from talking with him pulls at his conscience often, that he wants at many levels....but is unfamiliar and therefore scary for him to consider doing. Just like our desire to live that kind of lifestyle...seemingly free, having only enough money to get you to the next destination...is extinguished by our practicality about things like retirement...providing for a family...and having money to do things that require money to do like ski trips, alaska, etc. I think this just goes to show how difficult it is to make major lifestyle changes that go against years of living and thinking differently. Not just adapting to new creature comforts but changing one's mindset...which is scary...and difficult. More than you bargained for in a response eh?

"Yes and no. I think in many ways he is very similar to us. This is the lifestyle he has always led since college. To settle down and lay roots somewhere is something that I know from talking with him pulls at his conscience often, that he wants at many levels....but is unfamiliar and therefore scary for him to consider doing. Just like our desire to live that kind of lifestyle...seemingly free, having only enough money to get you to the next destination...is extinguished by our practicality about things like retirement...providing for a family...and having money to do things that require money to do like ski trips, alaska, etc. I think this just goes to show how difficult it is to make major lifestyle changes that go against years of living and thinking differently.

And the fact of the matter is I'm sorry on a number of levels. The most obvious is that I simply enjoy spending time with you...always fun and you always have intelligent things to say. At a different level, I think you have a very level head and are great at giving advice and I value you what you have to say about relationships, something I don't think I'm very good at yet. And finally, and at the deepest level, I want to hear what is happening in your life and how you are doing? I know there are things going on in your head about career, relationships, etc. and I'd love to hear about it and hopefully provide some sort of insight, help. You know I have always had a soft spot in my heart for you and in a strange way I cheer you for your successes and I am sad for you when you are troubled...I'll stop there because this just doesn't come across well through email.

"It's time again for the annual party that I host with John and a few good friends. Some of you have attended in the past.....it is best described as a college keg party...no frills...just cold beer, loud music, darts and lots of people. It has included everything from salsa dancing, moon pies, to individuals driving their vehicle through the yard to get out of their parking spot. The police have never been called to quiet things down, but don't let that discourage you from coming. If you can't attend...like I always say...there will be another next year. Please forward this on to anyone you think would be interested....this party is by all means not an invitation only gig. Here are the details: Saturday, January 27th, 7th Annual IDHAFR Party 6422 Wister Ln. 77008 (About 5 min from Memorial park, just across I10) Directions Below: (Call Mo:713-516-0651 or John: 832-724-7102 if you have trouble finding it) Come anytime after 6PM (Excluding ""Special"" invitees!!!) Party often lasts till after 3am and peaks between 9:30-11. There should be 2 or more kegs depending on how many people we expect...we floated the 2nd last year at around 10pm. Bring anyone and everyone you want.....the more the merrier. The later you come the farther you'll have to park I recommend avoiding driveways and fire hydrants and be kind to the neighbors.
