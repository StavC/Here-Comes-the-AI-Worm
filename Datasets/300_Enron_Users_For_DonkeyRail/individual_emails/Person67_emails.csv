A couple of outstanding questions- 1. Who am I reporting to? I would welcome the opportunity to report to you or Greg. I think my job was a lot easier in the past because our group had the backing of the Office of the Chair. This gave us credibility, independence, and the chance to contribute to strategic issues as well as the tactical issues of interest to the traders. However, I am obviously open to any reporting relationship you might suggest and I understand that my day-to-day duties will consist largely of interaction with the Fundy teams. 2.

Should we fail to close this transaction, we should look to our potential alternatives for withdrawing from the fund, unless of course we view that we will close but it will happen over the few days following. Interestingly, AIG may be planning to use further funds raised to create a second fund rather than add to the current fund leaving us with more of a percentage ownership but less capability of accessing the deals (fuel supply, despatch and EPC rights would not be attached to any second fund). We also have far too many people talking to AIG now and we need to stop this immediately, going forward only Joe Deffner should communicate with Bob as at the moment we have too many people doing all of the work for AIG for no return. As of Friday or the close of Alamac - Bob can only talk through Joe. We are not in the business of doing work for this fund. Can you put together (only if we fail to close) a short review for John of why we should stay in the fund over removing ourselves.

We are focused on externally launching the business by making two way prices on approximately 200 energy credits in the US, Canada, UK and Nordic markets by 24 Jan. 2000 but we expect to scale up the number of reference credits that we quote on very quickly. The initial names have been selected and provided to the credit department in both locations for initial review and will be subsequently distributed to the appropriate trading and origination groups for review prior to going live. The intent is to capture as much of the corporate credit market as possible, as quickly as possible, by leveraging our internal resources (people, processes and systems especially EnronOnline) and the new mediums for communication. To this extent, any ideas that you might have for getting the eyeballs of potential counterparties please let us know. This email marks the first of regular updates on our credit trading initiatives. We will use this as a mechanism to keep all of you in the loop as to where we are in the implementation process and solicit your input on ways to integrate credit products into your existing business models and customer base.",john.lavorato@enron.com,derek.davies@enron.com,"'John J Lavorato' : 'person', 'Bryan Seyfried' : 'person', 'email' : 'email'",3,EnronCredit.com,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,sent,john.lavorato@enron.com

"Tony Wow I don't think so. I thought I would rewrite yours and correct some of the factual errors. If you disagree please write me back. I moved from our Houston office in 1994 to Calgary and in 1999 was named President of the Canadian operation. We went from a small gas marketing shop to the dominant natural gas trader and originator in Canada. It was absolutely awesome. I had the time of my life. We built the business with very little supervision from Houston into a major contributor to Enron Corp's bottom line. These days, as many people know, we are using the same trading and risk management skills that we learned in the energy business to create liquid tradable markets in bandwidth, pulp and paper, coal, and many others. So our newer people still have the chance to do what I did in Canada and help build revolutionary new businesses. What a lot of people don't realize is how dominant our trading and risk management presence is in Natural Gas and Power. The opportunities our outstanding and the challenges will test the best minds out there. These businesses are interesting and very complicated with a million different variables to figure out ranging from the weather to the levels of gas storage in Montana to how to move power from New York to South Caralina. You can't put gas and power on a truck or store them in a warehouse like other commodities. Its not like trading bonds, where you sit around and try to figure out what the Fed is going to do.

The weighted average trade price via Enron Online will reflect a price of $15.76. This price was increased to $16.00 to encompass trades transacted via the telephone. The reason for the interest in this time period is as follows: Nicor Gas Company was closed for their company holiday on Friday, December 22nd. As a result, volumes delivered at Nicor were traded for the December 22-26 time period. Gas Daily published a price of $15.70 for the December 22-26 time period. Nicor Gas Company made a decision to buy gas on December 22nd (even though they were closed) for the December 23-26 time period, which resulted in a $13.88 posting for the December 23-26th period.

I also appreciate the tremendous amount of stress that you have been under especially considering the birth of your second child. I do not envy you now, yet I am sincerely grateful that it is you and Greg leading us through these times. The message that you have sent throughout my six years with Enron has been ""trust the system until it fails you"". We would all be disappointed if our troubled times were a result of a few (rather large) ill-conceived investments, but the violation of trust comes from the deliberate misrepresentation of facts. Namely the restatement of earnings and balance sheet items back to 1997. We have all based our decisions to continue employment with Enron upon publicly available information. Has fraudulence been proven in a court of law? No. However, the court of public opinion has already had it its trial, the perpetrators have been convicted and the victims now await retribution. In this matter, the corporation is responsible to the court of public opinions jurisdiction. I write you now to offer my version of justice.

"John: I got the e-mail last night with the tabs for the breakdown of the current 184 for Operations, inclusive of Power and Gas Logistics. (The tabs total 184 with one Associate noted on a separate line in Power Logistics, and 183 without that Associate, so I don't know whether you are using 183 or 184 currently for the Operations total.) Taking this number to 100 in total is obviously a big change - 45.6% reduction. At this moment, I don't know how feasible that is. But I will work with Jeff, Stacey and Leslie to find out. We need some questions answered first to go through this: 1) Who is coordinating the look at headcount reductions for Gas and Power Logistics? Together, those groups represent 25% of the 184 headcount. Going in, I would asssume that they would take their proportionate share of reductions - should be 21 reductions. We need to know who we should work with to coordinate this. Need names and weekend contact numbers. 2) What will the overall headcount be for Netco? What we need to know is how many gas and power traders there will be and whether or not their anticipated business scope changes. If commercial numbers don't change and the business scope doesn't change, a 45.6% reduction is probably out of the question. 3) Is the 100 number for Operations only a start-up number? Could we anticipate adding staff as business ramps up, approval is obtained for physical gas business, etc.? Or is the 100 number intended to be the total head",sally.beck@enron.com,john.lavorato@enron.com,"'John' : 'person', 'Jeff' : 'person', 'Stacey' : 'person', 'Leslie' : 'person'",4,Headcount for Operations - Need Questions Answered,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,received,john.lavorato@enron.com

"Dear John - The attached worksheet has my perspective on how the tolls should be escalated. I still think this is a conservative view, since I feel that we would be able to go to these pipes and negotiate a fixed toll for the remainder of the term, or even negotiate out of these contracts for a fee. (I'd love to take a crack at that!) TCPL is still a wild card, and I did not change the escalations that were shown.

"The ERCOT team has met with Joe Des Champs for the Mid Marketing position in our region. It is my understanding that you must interview Joe before we can make him a job offer. I would like to proceed with the interview process. Joe worked for me at Williams as the lead trader in the West. Here are my thoughts on Joe and why he is a good fit for our group. 1. He has a very good understanding of the trading business, especially natural gas in Texas and the western US. 2. His personality is a great fit for Texas (especially with the loss of Jim Ducote). Joe has a lot of successful relationships within Texas and relates well to Texans. His initial appearance and manners appear to be easy going and laid back, however he is a very agressive and effective trader. His command of the physical gas business is outstanding. 3. Learns fast and relates well to traders. I believe Doug and Joe will work well together. 4. Likes to work the phones. What he is not: 1. He is new to the power business. However, he served the Williams/AES plants in California. So he is familiar with the power. I would be glad to discuss Joe in detail or set up the phone interview. I have attached Joe's resume.

"We are concluding the valuation and booking of the Modesto Maranzana transaction.

We have already received a verbal indication from Duke that they would have an interest in the facility at $9 - $11 million.
