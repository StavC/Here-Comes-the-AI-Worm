"Tana, Enron Canada is currently negotiating a transaction with 6 major municipalities in Ontario (the ""G6"") to provide various services to a company those 6 entities are setting up, which services will include physical and financial trading (both gas and electricity).

"Peter, I have considered your issue in point three below and, further to our discussion, I believe that the issue is addressed in Paragraph 8(d) of the credit support annex. That paragraph indicates that, upon termination, where no amounts are payable by Pledgor (the party that has posted collateral) to Secured Party (the party holding the posted collateral), the Secured Party will transfer all posted collateral (plus interest if the posted collateral is cash) to the Pledgor. Therefore, although in your third example Bow Valley would be required to post a letter of credit for the $15 million, upon termination ECC would owe the $240 million to Bow Valley and Paragraph 8(d) would kick in, such that ECC would be required to return the letter of credit to Bow Valley and pay the $240 million. The mechanism set forth in Paragraph 8(d) clearly makes sense in a multi-transaction situation but doesn't really make sense in this situation, since, in your third example, ECC could call for a letter of credit from Bow Valley knowing full well that it will never be able to actually use it, thereby simply making Bow Valley incur the cost of posting the letter of credit. However, I think this is a point that we should leave for the bank to raise, if they are concerned about it. Practically speaking, I would think that, given these facts, ECC would simply not call for the letter of credit from Bow Valley in your third example, as it provides no real protection.

"Further to the e-mail sent out this morning by Soma regarding the revised structure, although things have not yet been completely finalized, in order to be in a position to execute documents by Thursday, I think we need to continue or, where necessary start, the preparation of documents. Based on Soma's structuring e-mail, $150 million will be coming from Royal Bank of Canada (RBC) and $150 million from The Toronto-Dominion Bank (TD), with Chase Manhattan Bank (Chase) acting as the sleeve on both transactions. Regarding RBC's transaction, RBC will step into the shoes of Bow Valley Trust in the previous documents, so that RBC will be the counterparty under Swap 1. RBC will remain as the counterparty under the interest rate swap and Chase will step into the spot where RBC was in the previous structure (with ENA put into the mix to do the swap with Chase).

"Mark, I wanted to get back to you on your questions and also give a little more detail of the analysis. As you know, we have issues in Canada about taking cash collateral, which issues have been clearly identified and communicated by Peter previously (see his e-mails of March 20, 2001). However, as opposed to cash, it appears clear under our personal property registration legislation that a certified cheque and a bank draft would fall under the definition of ""instruments"". Under such legislation, as Peter has indicated below, a security interest in ""instruments"" can be perfected by possession, thus eliminating the need to register the security interest at the personal property registry, which requirement to register creates the perfection and priority concerns we have with holding cash collateral. Therefore, at first blush, it seems that a counterparty providing a certified cheque or bank draft to us (in lieu of cash collateral or a letter of credit), which certified cheque or bank draft would be held by us in the same manner as we hold L/Cs, might solve our cash collateral concerns and make another credit instrument available to us for use in Canada. There are a few concerns, which I think are raised by your questions. The first is that, if we take the instrument and immediately convert it to cash and place the cash in an account, we run into the exact same issues as we have with taking cash collateral in the first place. The personal property security legislation specifically indicates that proceeds realized from dealing with the original collateral need to be perfected in the same manner as original collateral of",greg.johnston@enron.com,mark.taylor@enron.com,"'Mark' : 'person', 'Peter' : 'person', 'Peter' : 'person'",3,Re: Cash Collateral,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,sent,greg.johnston@enron.com

"Dianne, further to our conversation this morning, this e-mail will confirm the following: 1. The current form of Master Physical Gas Agreement with Duke is an older master which indicates that transactions must be confirmed in writing and arguably provides that such confirms are not binding until executed by both parties. However, the EnronOnline Electronic Trading Agreement indicates that, where a confirm is issued, it is deemed accepted unless objected to within three business days. There is no indication in the EOL Electronic Trading Agreement how a conflict between the provisions of that agreement and any master agreement will be resolved, but I think that for the purposes of the EnronOnline transactions, we can rely on the terms of the Electronic Trading Agreement and, if Duke has not objected to the terms set forth in the EOL confirm within three business days, determine that such confirms are valid and binding upon the counterparty. 2. However, with respect to any physical gas transactions entered into with Duke under the Master but not through EnronOnline, we still need them to execute and return the confirm. 3. Regarding financial deals entered into through EnronOnline and made pursuant to the electronic form of GTC, the terms of the Electronic Trading Agreement will govern and, unless Duke objects to the terms of the confirm within three business days, the confirm is deemed to be valid and binding on Duke. 4.

"Mark, I wanted to get back to you on your questions and also give a little more detail of the analysis. As you know, we have issues in Canada about taking cash collateral, which issues have been clearly identified and communicated by Peter previously (see his e-mails of March 20, 2001). However, as opposed to cash, it appears clear under our personal property registration legislation that a certified cheque and a bank draft would fall under the definition of ""instruments"". Under such legislation, as Peter has indicated below, a security interest in ""instruments"" can be perfected by possession, thus eliminating the need to register the security interest at the personal property registry, which requirement to register creates the perfection and priority concerns we have with holding cash collateral. Therefore, at first blush, it seems that a counterparty providing a certified cheque or bank draft to us (in lieu of cash collateral or a letter of credit), which certified cheque or bank draft would be held by us in the same manner as we hold L/Cs, might solve our cash collateral concerns and make another credit instrument available to us for use in Canada. There are a few concerns, which I think are raised by your questions. The first is that, if we take the instrument and immediately convert it to cash and place the cash in an account, we run into the exact same issues as we have with taking cash collateral in the first place. The personal property security legislation specifically indicates that proceeds realized from dealing with the original collateral need to be perfected in the same manner as original collateral of",greg.johnston@enron.com,mark.taylor@enron.com,"'Mark' : 'person', 'Peter' : 'person', 'Peter' : 'person'",3,Re: Cash Collateral,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,sent,greg.johnston@enron.com

"Greg: Can you help me answer this question? Also, we have been through our ISDA forms and had the following questions with respect to Canadian law matters? 1. We have assumed that for all ISDA Masters where Canadian law applies, we should not insert our arbitration provision. Is this correct? 2. With respect to the Trade Option exemption and Eligible Swap Participant reps that we normally insert in our form (which I have enclosed below), we have assumed that the only time that these reps should not be inserted is when the Master is between ECC and a Canadian or Foreign counterparty? Is this correct? What we are unsure about is whther these reps are needed when ECC's counterparty is a US entity. We look forward to hearing from you.

"I agree with Milly's comments and concerns in his attached e-mail. A few points: 1. I would send a clarifying memo, and would speak specifically to Diane Seib and Peggy Hedstom to ensure for the time being that all physical and financial power transactions receive legal review. This does not mean that Linda/Sharon have to document all of them, rather we can still leave it up to documentation where appropriate. But a lawyer needs to review all power confirms for the time being (physical and financial) to make sure that the product is being properly defined. 2. In terms of power product definition, Milly has raised valid concerns which warrant legal review, which are market opening risk, change in market rules between now and market opening, and the size of the transactions being entered into. There is also the inherent risks of the PPA, in essence interrutible risk. All these risks need to managed at the front end. i.e. Once a deal is executed by the trader, the lawyer cannot fix it after the fact. Although the power traders or originators should already understand these risks for the product when they are transacting, please meet with Davies and Zufferli ASAP to ensure that they are cognizant of these risks when they are transacting. 3. Please check our corporate resolutions to make sure that they cover off execution of confirms for power transactions in a similar fashion to gas transactions (i.e. anything over a year must be signed by Milly, if",peter.keohane@enron.com,greg.johnston@enron.com,"'Milly' : 'person', 'Diane Seib' : 'person', 'Peggy Hedstom' : 'person', 'Linda/Sharon' : 'person', 'Milly' : 'person', 'Davies' : 'person', 'Zufferli' : 'person', 'Milly' : 'person'",8,Re: Canadian Financial Trading Confirmation Process,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,received,greg.johnston@enron.com
