"Attached is the updated exposure report for California. There are four spreadsheets: 1) PG&E Corp and affilate exposure, 2) Edison International and affiliate exopsure, 3) CAISO and Cal PX exposure, and 4) Enron business unit combined CA exposure. We are continuing to make progress on the mitigation of PG&E non-regulated exposures. Please give me a call if you have any specific questions on the numbers. Bill 3-3831 Please note: The numbers for the PX Credit have increased based on a more complete valuation. The P/X Credit MTM exposures are not netted against EES payables of T&D (with netting there would be an estimated $200mm reduction in PX Credit exposure) All MTM numbers are valued at the Mid Curves.

"Thanks for the feedback. I think this is right in line with CRM's proposal and will definitely meet our objective to control credit risks with higher risk counterparties. It is an excellent Phase 1 solution which we certainly can try to address more systematically in future developments. We have done some initial review of the current deal flow in Houston and London and don't expect this language to impact a high percentage of transactions. Based on our review of recently executed Enron transactions we expect about 80% of total transactions will not be impacted by this language. Most of our deal flow is with highly rated counterparties. However, as we build the Online Trading volume with more customers, we expect the majority of our customers will require this GTC language.

RAC, however, is close to finishing a new process for commodity embedded financings--both prepaids and tilted swaps--that would not require a full DASH but an abbreviated approval document based upon specified credit ratings, financing amounts, and maturities for transactions having standard credit documentation. For example, a $25 million, five-year exposure to a AAA counterparty with standard documentation is contemplated to be approved via this abbreviated approval document. This abbreviated approval document would only be available for transactions meeting these criteria if: (i) structured financing capacity were available, (ii) the funds flow issue created is manageable (both (i) and (ii) as confirmed by EGF), and (iii) the pricing met a threshold that included the structured financing cost, an appropriate credit spread/reserve, and a syndication risk premium.

As you know, ENA has an unsecured claim for $25,334. An objection to the claim was filed, but later withdrawn. First distributions were made in this bankruptcy in October, but the objection to ENA's claim may still have been pending at that time, so that ENA would not have received a distribution. The next distribution will be in January and the distributions will occur quarterly thereafter. If we did not receive a distribution in October, we will get both our first and second distributions in January.

The original $340,000,000 has been reduced to $240,000,000 and is to be further reduced as a result of pricing changes. In addition, Enron is apparently providing a new or increased letter of credit, which will be sufficient to cover the reduced liability. As a result it is expected that the necessity for the cash deposit will disappear next week, perhaps as early as Tuesday. If this proves to be the case, the credit annex will not be required, thereby making life easier for both of us. If the foregoing result does not occur as early in the week as contemplated or if it becomes necessary for your cash management purposes, Powerex has no objection to signing a letter extending the interim letter agreement for, say, another 2 weeks (if it becomes apparent that the cash deposit will still be required after that time we will have to revisit the drafting",linda.simmons@enron.com,william.bradford@enron.com,"'JANET MOORE' : 'person', 'Linda J Simmons' : 'person', 'pbradley@lawsonlundell.com' : 'email', 'Janet.H.Moore@enron.com cc' : 'email', 'Powerex' : 'credit card brand', 'Powerex' : 'credit card brand', 'Powerex' : 'credit card brand'",7,RE: Draft Credit Annex,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,received,william.bradford@enron.com

Clint and Jeff are anxious to proceed with the negotiation of ISDA Master Agreements with the parties we have been discussing. Please send credit to me for preparation of documentation. As always, please let me know if you have any questions. Thanks.

ISDA Master Agreements Bill: I am resending my earlier message which identifies the correct legal entities with which Enron Corp. would like to execute ISDA Master Agreements (for the purpose of entering into equity trades). In addition to the entities listed below, we need to include ""Merrill Lynch International"" (""MLI""). ENA just negotiated an agreement with MLI, so the Enron Corp. master should be fairly simple. Also, Clint and Jeff are interested in transacting with Toronto Dominion Bank. In that regard I note that Enron has an Interest Rate and Currency Agreement with Toronto Dominion Bank, New York Branch. I'll review this agreement to see if it requires amendment. Jeff/Clint: Do want to deal with a specific Toronto Dominion branch? All: I will expect that Bill will provide credit worksheets and I'll either begin the ISDA process or change ""ENA"" to",sara.shackleton@enron.com,william.bradford@enron.com,"'Sara Shackleton' : 'person', 'Sara Shackleton' : 'person', 'William S Bradford' : 'person', 'Jeff Nogid' : 'person', 'Clint Freeland' : 'person'",5,Enron Corp.

"Billy We need to hedge funds. ----- Forwarded by John J Lavorato/Corp/Enron on 01/22/2001 10:00 PM ----- Caroline Abramo 01/22/2001 12:18 PM To: Andy Zipper/Corp/Enron@Enron cc: Per Sekse/NY/ECT@ECT, Jeffrey A Shankman/HOU/ECT@ECT, John J Lavorato/Corp/Enron@Enron Subject: EOL/ Hedge Funds Most of the macro hedge funds want to trade global crude products and gas options immediately. However, I am having a big problem getting Tudor and like funds up and running on EOL- Problems: #1: Credit- major back-log on new names - we don't have enough resources to deal with these names (the structures of the funds can be complex- not like dealing with industrials). #2: With those that we have docs, credit has said we can not trade on-line. (???) The only differences I see with funds trading online is that their trades need to go to credit's (Bill Bradford's group) to be included in daily MTM and 5 day VAR reports. We calculate variation margin off these reports so its essential credit gets the trades... AND In the case of Tudor, they allocate trades between funds- the EOL trades would need to go to me or the backoffice, so we could allocate them. I think the EOL reporting issues can easily be resolved- the credit back log is the real killer at the moment.

"If PG&E's LOCs are related to the now cancelled long term power trades, they clearly should not be renewed. What are the SCE LOCs for?

Cc: Sanders, Richard Subject: Re: PX LCs Bill I spoke with Richard and we will have to renew. He is currently trying to get the PX bankruptcy court to allow us to take back our security in light of the FERC ruling re chargebacks, but due to uncertainty of the FERC ruling, court has not been willing to allow us to remove. Richard continues on the case. In the meanwhile, the PX/bankruptcy court will not allow the LC's to expire without drawing down. So we should go ahead and renew.

RAC, however, is close to finishing a new process for commodity embedded financings--both prepaids and tilted swaps--that would not require a full DASH but an abbreviated approval document based upon specified credit ratings, financing amounts, and maturities for transactions having standard credit documentation. For example, a $25 million, five-year exposure to a AAA counterparty with standard documentation is contemplated to be approved via this abbreviated approval document. This abbreviated approval document would only be available for transactions meeting these criteria if: (i) structured financing capacity were available, (ii) the funds flow issue created is manageable (both (i) and (ii) as confirmed by EGF), and (iii) the pricing met a threshold that included the structured financing cost, an appropriate credit spread/reserve, and a syndication risk premium.
