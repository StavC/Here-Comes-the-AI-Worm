It was even warm enough to go out on the wave runners. This weekend should be even better! I might go to Las Vegas tonight . A friend was served with divorce papers today and is not doing real well and wants to go for 24 hours. We would have to be back Wednesday night since he has to be over in Louisiana Thursday. If I go what number do you want me to bet for you on roulette? I would have said 38 but that's to high a number, (JUST KIDDING) Your laughing , right! Its not really a great time since I have such a large position, but Its something I need to do.

"The Gas and Power Trading organizations have had a tremendous year. Sometimes we as traders forget some of the crucial parts of the organization that significantly contributed to that success. I believe the Weather Group comprised of Mike Robert's, Jose Marquez, Stephen Bennett and Dave Ryan from Power are one of those groups. These individuals have done a tremendous job of predicting summer weather along with the route hurricanes would take. The greatest achievement has been the November and December winter forecast. They held fast to their cold forecast even when outside services were moderating. On a score card with all other services they definitely deserve an ""A+"".

Troy / Jim: The following are issues or concerns that I think need to be addressed. If its OK I will pass these on as the pop into my head. 1) The 2001 Ad Valorem Tax should be allocated at closing based on the period of time each entity owns the facilities. This is important since the 2001 tax owed should be significantly higher (2 to 3 times the 2000 value) given the higher pricing. 2) Houston PipeLine has an Agricultural Exemption on the land out at Bammel on the Ad Valorem Tax. I believe this Exemption has to be renewed every two years. I would think that Enron would want to retain responsibility for renewing this exemption. Both parties have a vested interest since it will impact AEP's tax liability over the next 30 years but Enron wants the facility back with the exemption intact. 3) Houston PipeLine also has an agreement with the state of Texas regarding Production Tax. HPL only pays Production Tax on 7.5% of the withdrawal volumes. I do not think this will be impacted by the sale but it might be worth a quick review by the lawyer's. Ted Ryan can discuss the Ad Valorem Tax issues with you and the last person I talked to about the Production Tax issue was Dan Hyvl. Hope this is what you are looking for in this process.

"Paul: This storage facility does not really excite me! The pipeline interconnect to TXU/Lone Star would be OK for withdrawals/Deliveries but would not be very desirable for receipts/Injections. TXU/Lone Star would have no incentive to work with us regarding transportation to and from the facility. A notional market value would be around $.60 per MMBtu of capacity. Under the first two cases the capacity could be cycled a maximum of 7 times per year and 4.5 times for the third case. This $.60 has to cover all of the following costs: 1) Injection Fuel at the stg facility. 2) Injection and withdrawal commodity costs charged by the operator. 3) All Transportation costs of getting and receiving the gas at liquid points. In summary this is not a storage facility that would be high on my list to acquire capacity. In 2001 I would rather concentrate on facilities that I can obtain high deliverability and have multiple interconnects that are desirable and have competitive environments.

"As of today May 9, 2001 Bammel has working gas of approximately 20.3 TBTU. Economics are favorable to keep injecting. I estimate that injections will average around 1TBTU per week through May 31, 2001 which would result in another 3+ TBTU beibng injected. At the current pricing level this means that AEP would owe Enron somewhere around $98 million. Is this something Accounting should be working into the AEP settlement to pay Enron on June 1, 2001?

"Hey Jim, While I was out on vacation last week, Patrick unwound some positions that brought Westpark onto the radar screen. Not having my understanding or knowledge of this relationship, the credit analyst looking at the trades asked the market risk to run a 5-day VAR. Excluding December, the open position (which later was completely unwound) had positive 5-day VAR that exceeded the collateral being held, i.e. $1.5MM. Because Patrick did eventually close out his position while deep in the money, their is no credit risk on any of his business. However, combing the volatile nature of this price environment (prompt, gas daily being so dramatic), large volumes, and one sided nature of trading, we are now uncomfortable with the $300M/Bcf rule. Until the market calms a bit, what was once quoted as $300M for each Bcf open, is now $1MM for each Bcf open. This collateral to be posted upfront. By increasing this multiple, we should easily be able to stay within the 99th percentile of probable VAR. Please communicate this strategy to Patrick and let me know if you would like to schedule a meeting to further discuss. thanks brant",brant.reves@enron.com,jim.schwieger@enron.com,"'Jim' : 'person', 'Patrick' : 'person', 'Patrick' : 'person', 'Patrick' : 'person', 'brant' : 'person'",5,New Westpark Collateral rules,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,received,jim.schwieger@enron.com

"FYI -----Original Message----- From: Webb, Jay Sent: Wednesday, November 21, 2001 2:05 PM To: Zipper, Andy Subject: RE: order problem Hi Andy, When it was decided that we would accept multi-day orders, we pointed out to Lavo and John that we do system maintenance for an hour every Friday night. Their position was anytime we take the system down for any reason, planned or un-planned, we should kill all orders to prevent someone from being unable to cancel an order while the system was down and then having it fill before he can get to it. We actually have a plan in place to make this much better. Effectively, we will have dual sites. The second site will be used both for disaster recovery, as well as a convenient way to manage code releases without an outage. Unfortunately, purchasing the hardware for this has been put on hold given the present circumstances. --jay -----Original Message----- From: Zipper, Andy Sent: Wednesday, November 21, 2001 1:51 PM To: Webb, Jay Subject: order problem Jay, Have received comments that when multi day limit orders are placed, they are not alive after a friday night.

At the current pricing level this means that AEP would owe Enron somewhere around $98 million. Is this something Accounting should be working into the AEP settlement to pay Enron on June 1, 2001?

"Jim, I can assure you that neither John or myself are trying to attract blame or ""cover our backsides""; however, I do believe that there is/was a genuine breakdown in communication somewhere in the deal team, accounting and the desk.

As executives of this company, you, Brian, Tim and Tom absolutely were responsible to ensure that all aspects of this transaction are managed correctly.

"We just got some more information in the mail yesterday on the College Savings Plan. We will study it some more, and let you know how good or bad it sounds. Some good may be that YOU could deduct the amount you give on YOUR income tax (there doesn't seem to be a cap on deducting the amount you give if you make big bucks). The initial bad I see is the $24/year fee plus .6% of earnings. Anyway, we will look it over in more detail. They do not restrict you to only go to Nebraska colleges, and you do not have to be a Nebraska resident to open up an account. Josh and Jarrod could each have an account, with annual contributions up to $165,000 (tax deferred), and when you take the money out, it is taxed at Josh and Jarrods tax rate. Please remind me/reassure me about the Educational IRA. It is similar to a Roth IRA in that taxes are paid (by you in this case)on the money prior to putting it into the account. I don't list it anywhere on my income tax forms until we start taking the money out. In essence it is as if we are putting $500 of our own money (taxes already paid) into the account, right? There is no school again today. Ice on the roads and more ice and snow to come later today. I think this is the 5th or 6th day they have missed. They have to make it up at the end of the school year.

We thought about having him ride back on the bus to Omaha (so he doesn't miss out on the fun stuff they do on the way back), arriving Monday the 2nd around noon, and then we all fly out together on the afternoon of the 2nd or... Mark Anna and I leave on Friday or Saturday the 28th or 29th, and have Marlyss and Gary help Ben catch a flight Monday the 2nd or Tuesday the 3rd. Mark should be able to take the whole week off. The other tricky thing in the whole deal has to do with whether Ben will have to take summer school. He has been told that if he flunks a class this semester, he will have to retake it in summer school. We won't know for sure if he is going to flunk until the middle or",mwoita@home.com,jim.schwieger@enron.com,"'Mom' : 'person', 'sinus problems' : 'medical condition', 'e-mail' : 'email', 'Ben' : 'person', 'Mark Anna' : 'person', 'Marlyss' : 'person', 'Gary' : 'person', 'Ben' : 'person', 'Ben' : 'person'",9,RE: Thanks,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,received,jim.schwieger@enron.com
"Jim, Thanks a lot. It is difficult to find a better example example of commitment to Enron and to professional excellence than our weather guys.

Sometimes we as traders forget some of the crucial parts of the organization that significantly contributed to that success. I believe the Weather Group comprised of Mike Robert's, Jose Marquez, Stephen Bennett and Dave Ryan from Power are one of those groups. These individuals have done a tremendous job of predicting summer weather along with the route hurricanes would take. The greatest achievement has been the November and December winter forecast. They held fast to their cold forecast even when outside services were moderating. On a score card with all other services they definitely deserve an ""A+"". When you are down on the 32nd floor it would be nice if you would stop and congratulate them on a tremendous job and their contribution to our success.

"We just got some more information in the mail yesterday on the College Savings Plan. We will study it some more, and let you know how good or bad it sounds. Some good may be that YOU could deduct the amount you give on YOUR income tax (there doesn't seem to be a cap on deducting the amount you give if you make big bucks). The initial bad I see is the $24/year fee plus .6% of earnings. Anyway, we will look it over in more detail. They do not restrict you to only go to Nebraska colleges, and you do not have to be a Nebraska resident to open up an account. Josh and Jarrod could each have an account, with annual contributions up to $165,000 (tax deferred), and when you take the money out, it is taxed at Josh and Jarrods tax rate. Please remind me/reassure me about the Educational IRA. It is similar to a Roth IRA in that taxes are paid (by you in this case)on the money prior to putting it into the account. I don't list it anywhere on my income tax forms until we start taking the money out. In essence it is as if we are putting $500 of our own money (taxes already paid) into the account, right? There is no school again today. Ice on the roads and more ice and snow to come later today. I think this is the 5th or 6th day they have missed. They have to make it up at the end of the school year.

"Jim, I can assure you that neither John or myself are trying to attract blame or ""cover our backsides""; however, I do believe that there is/was a genuine breakdown in communication somewhere in the deal team, accounting and the desk. As well, it appears that this is not completely a black and white issue and can legitimately attract a number of points of view. As executives of this company, you, Brian, Tim and Tom absolutely were responsible to ensure that all aspects of this transaction are managed correctly. Nevertheless, I think it is amazing we have not had more problems with this divestment given the size, complexity, time and how intertwined it is into the overall framework of ENA.

"Jim, this issue is adequately covered in the lease and related documents which were blessed by you and the storage reservoir engineers. Why this late expressed concern?..........if you have facts which lead you to believe that AEP/HPL is operating this facility contrary to safe/industry standards or regulatory requirements or is otherwise endangering the facility, related facilities or the integrity thereof, please call me ASAP. Sincerely Barbara Jim Schwieger/ENRON@enronXgate 06/07/2001 04:16 PM To: Brian Redmond/ENRON@enronXgate, Barbara N Gray/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: John J Lavorato/ENRON@enronXgate, Thomas A Martin/ENRON@enronXgate Subject: Bammel Lease Question I was wondering if the Bammel lease to AEP contains any operating parameters to protect the integrity of the facility. The question arises from the fact that Bammel had about 24 BCF of remaining capacity when Enron turned the facility over to AEP. We believe their plan is to max inject in June which would reduce the remaining capacity to around 12 BCF. It could become a challenge to keep injections under the remaining 12 BCF level during the reaming 4-5 months of the injection cycle. Enron always operated the facility with the understanding that a Gas In Place volume greater than 117.5 BCF could create a high enough pressure to jeopardize the safety of the wellhead casings and some of the abandoned wells. We would not want the Texas RRC to question the ",gray@enron.com,jim.schwieger@enron.com,"'Jim Schwieger' : 'person', 'Brian Redmond' : 'person', 'Barbara N Gray' : 'person', 'John J Lavorato' : 'person', 'Thomas A Martin' : 'person'",5,Re: Bammel Lease Question,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,received,jim.schwieger@enron.com

"Hey Jim, While I was out on vacation last week, Patrick unwound some positions that brought Westpark onto the radar screen. Not having my understanding or knowledge of this relationship, the credit analyst looking at the trades asked the market risk to run a 5-day VAR. Excluding December, the open position (which later was completely unwound) had positive 5-day VAR that exceeded the collateral being held, i.e. $1.5MM. Because Patrick did eventually close out his position while deep in the money, their is no credit risk on any of his business. However, combing the volatile nature of this price environment (prompt, gas daily being so dramatic), large volumes, and one sided nature of trading, we are now uncomfortable with the $300M/Bcf rule. Until the market calms a bit, what was once quoted as $300M for each Bcf open, is now $1MM for each Bcf open. This collateral to be posted upfront. By increasing this multiple, we should easily be able to stay within the 99th percentile of probable VAR. Please communicate this strategy to Patrick and let me know if you would like to schedule a meeting to further discuss. thanks brant",brant.reves@enron.com,jim.schwieger@enron.com,"'Jim' : 'person', 'Patrick' : 'person', 'Patrick' : 'person', 'Patrick' : 'person', 'brant' : 'person'",5,New Westpark Collateral rules,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,received,jim.schwieger@enron.com
