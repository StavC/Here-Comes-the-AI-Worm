"I just spoke with another lawyer in our firm that worked at the Robins Caplin plaintiffs firm where Joe Dunn was before he went to Mark Robinson's firm. From an associates perspective, Joe Dunn was never the person to write the briefs. He would always have his cross examination scripted by others. The bottom line is that Joe Dunn can be very dangerous with the correct support -- on his own, he is unlikely to figure it out. Said differently, Joe Dunn is not a nuts and bolts lawyer. He is the front person -- great in front of people and the big picture. He last was involved in a case in 1993-94. I spoke with another partner in our firm whose wife is a former partner of Joe Dunn's. Another report that Joe is very long on show and short on hard work. The circumstances under which he left the Robin Caplin firm were not favorable. Joe is very well connected, having spent most of his time networking. There is the possibility that there are some things in Joe's past that he is not particularly proud of. He is a politician and anything that will promote his career, he will use. Said differently, he talks a great game but is probably marginal on the legal issues.

"Tim, Wednesday the California Deputy Attorney General agreed to the following treatment of email at the Portland facility. I confirmed this procedure in writing to him and have not heard any disagreement: In Portland, we proposed to handle business email related to the topics in your preservation letter by instructing employees not to delete any email sent or received for 24 hours. Email that is personal and does not relate to the business topics you have identified can be kept, discarded etc. at the employee's pleasure. Each day there is a backup made that will capture the email in those employees mailboxes. After 24 hours, each employee is free to manage their email box as they deem appropriate to the business needs (e.g. keep, discard). In addition, I discussed with the Attorney General the following procedure for when an employee runs out of hard disk space on his/her computer. Again, I have not heard any disagreement regarding this procedure. When an employee runs out of hard disk space on their computer, it is an acceptable practice to copy files from their hard disk to the network (where they will be backed up) and then delete those copied files to make sufficient work space for the employee to work. Below are our recommendations for the text of an email to all EPMI personnel in Portland. Dan Dietrich has confirmed that the IT backroom support for this policy is in place and that we may implement today. Please send me a copy of the email that you distribute.

"Mike Day has been in discussions with Harvey Morris this week about Enron's responses. According to Harvey, they are about to issue a second motion to compel at FERC and if Enron does not want to get its name on that pleading, we are being asked to give a date certain when we will have data available for the PUC. Today we submitted the EES/EEMC data which Harvey acknowledged. Harvey claims he is under extreme pressure to treat Enron as being not cooperative. We need to decide what to do with the Portland General information as well. I know that Dave Aamodt would like to produce that information to the PUC if at all possible. According to Mike Day, we probably have a few days to respond before the PUC will move to compel. By then we would need to submit our formal objections and responses.

"Here is a summary of recent developments: Natural Gas and Electricity Class Action Complaint Against El Paso Two plaintiffs attorneys filed a class action complaint alleging anti-trust and unfair competition against El Paso and 100 Does for inflating natural gas prices and the price of electricity. The complaint alleges that this was done by withholding capacity on the El Paso and Trans Western pipelines. <<gascomplaint.pdf>> Ron Carroll's Analysis of Private Cause of Action One of the assignments from our Portland meeting was to find out whether or not there was a private right of action (or prohibition of same) under the Federal Power Act. Here is Ron Carroll's response: The courts have refused to create a private cause of action for violations of the FPA, stating that the regulatory scheme created by Congress vested the regulatory body with the power to pursue enforcement. See Clark v. Gulf Oil Corp., 570 F.2d 1138, 1149 (1977) (pertaining to the recovery of losses due to allegedly unlawful rates under the NGA); City of Gainesville v. Florida Power & Light Co., 488 F. Supp. 1258, 1277-78 (S.D. Fla. 1980) (noting that the legislative history of the NGA, which was modeled after the FPA, does not suggest the existence of any private rights of action).

"Richard, I included a copy of the Berg anti-trust and unfair competition complaint filed by Tom Girardi and others in Los Angeles. Tom Girardi is the single best plaintiff's lawyer in southern California. You may recall his results against PG&E, Lockheed etc. where recovered billions of dollars. He is well funded and has really good lawyers that work for him. He is reputed to have close associations with many state court judges in Los Angeles. Both Dick Odom and Michael Molland have been opposite Tom Girardi for other clients. Dick represented Roberts & Stevens in a complicated securities case Fightertown v. Roberts & Stevens that was tried for 8 weeks. Tom Girardi posted $320M as damages in the case. He received a verdict of $7.0M which was eliminated by Dick's motion for JNOV. Dick is one of the very few trial lawyers that have gone head to head with Tom in significant trial and won. Dick was recently retained in another case where Tom Girardi is the plaintiff's lawyer. Apparently, we knew somebody who happened to be with Tom Girardi when he received Brobeck's appearance. His comment was something to the effect of ""Oh shit. Not those bastards again."" Not many defendants have the courage to take a case where Girardi is the plaintiff's counsel to trial. Very few of the companies that have taken him to trial have won. Mike Molland has also had several cases opposite Tom Girardi where Michael represented Browning Ferris Industries as its lead trial lawyer",gfergus@brobeck.com,richard.b.sanders@enron.com,"'Richard' : 'person', 'Tom Girardi' : 'person', 'Tom Girardi' : 'person', 'Dick Odom' : 'person', 'Michael Molland' : 'person', 'Tom Girardi' : 'person', 'Tom Girardi' : 'person', 'Tom Girardi' : 'person', 'Tom Girardi' : 'person', 'Brobeck' : 'person', 'Mike Molland' : 'person', 'Tom Girardi' : 'person'",12,Berg Complaint - LA Issues,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,sent,gfergus@brobeck.com

"Tim, Here is the email you should send out with respect to retention of hard copies of documents. IMPORTANT EPMI POLICY REGARDING HARD COPY DOCUMENTS WHILE LITIGATION IS PENDING This policy is in addition to my prior email about the procedure for handling email and electronic documents. While most of what we do is contained within Enron's electronic systems, there still are times when hard copies are made or needed for running our business. Here is how you must handle those hard copy documents: 1. The basic rule is that if you have hard copies of documents that are used in EPMI's business of selling energy in the WSCC, you must keep those documents until further notice. If space becomes a problem, please contact _____ who can arrange for storage. 2. What constitutes a document? In some instances you will have one copy of a document that has your handwritten notes on it, and another copy that may be clean. For these purposes both are considered documents and both must be saved. Similarly, if several people have copies of the same document, each separate copy is considered a separate document. On the other hand, if you made 10 copies for a meeting and there were 4 left over that were never handed out or were not used, those may be recycled so long as you keep the ones that were used. If you keep handwritten notes for your work, those would be considered documents as well. Telephone notes, charts, printouts of data, spreadsheets etc. all constitute documents. If you have a question about what constitutes a document and whether it should be saved, please",gfergus@brobeck.com,tim.belden@enron.com,"'Tim' : 'person', 'email' : 'email', 'email' : 'email', 'email' : 'email', '_____' : 'email'",5,Document Retention,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,sent,gfergus@brobeck.com

"PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL ATTORNEY CLIENT PRIVILEGE Richard, After today's discussion here are our brainstorming ideas on options: 1. WAIT FOR A BETTER PROTECTIVE ORDER Ask Harvey Morris where they are on fixing the protective order that is being litigated by others. If the protective order has not changed, then unilaterally postpone production until it is. Pro: Better protection and more time; Con: Even with a more stringent protective order Enron still questions whether the PUC is entitled to financial performance data. Thus, this option does not fully disclose all of Enron's positions and the company may be accused later of simply engaging in delaying tactics. Under this option we file our formal objections as well. 2. TURN OVER THE TRANSACTION DATA AS IS Continue on our present course of turning over transaction data for electricity that was delivered. Pro: PUC will get the data anyway either through FERC, unfair competition, antitrust or price gouging litigation. By turning over the data that will show profits, PUC might slow down investigation there as opposed to interrupting the business by seeking to depose witnesses etc. Con: This would be waiving the legitimate question that Enron has as to the PUC's ability to discovery this information through a subpoena. There is also a question of how confidential this data would be given the current political agenda. It might also serve to whet the appetite of the PUC for more Enron information and discovery. This option would also provide confidential proprietary information to the",gfergus@brobeck.com,richard.b.sanders@enron.com,"'Richard' : 'person', 'Harvey Morris' : 'person'",2,Some thoughts on options,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,sent,gfergus@brobeck.com
"I spoke with Neha Nissen at McCutchen Doyle (Terry was out). She actually did the responses and is forwarding them to us. (They may be the same ones that Mike Day forwarded attached to his email). She said that they had received two subpoenas - the August 18th version and the September 22 version. To the August 18th, they provided general information documents, objected formally to the protective order. She said they had trading data ready to turn over provided the protective order was changed. With respect to the September 22nd version, she said that they objected as duplicative of the first and its overbreadth. They objected on burden, trade secret and jurisdictional grounds. I also spoke with Gordon Erspamer. He said that they were following Williams lead in a me too fashion.

The Enron Entities are willing to assist the Commission in undertaking its investigation into the problems in the California electric markets by producing the information specified on a timely basis. We believe that the limited production we propose will enable the Commission to commence its investigation much sooner than if the parties were forced to litigate all of the potential objections to the requests for production, which are, by any standard, extremely broad and could involve millions of pages of documents. We make these proposals pursuant to our email exchange of October 3, 2000 with the understanding that the Commission agrees that by cooperating, offering to produce or producing documents, the Enron Entities have not waived any objections or challenges to these subpoenas whatsoever and that any claims, defenses, objections, jurisdictional or otherwise or other responses have been specifically reserved",gfergus@brobeck.com,"richard.b.sanders@enron.com, msmith1@enron.com, david_aamodt@pgn.com,

"Here is today's status report: FERC Megawatt Daily reports that requests for rehearing before FERC have been filed even though the November 1, 2000 draft order is not yet final. Cal PX said they could not implement the software necessary to run the soft caps by January 1st. The City San Diego requested rehearing on the issue of whether FERC has the authority to order refunds. The City of San Diego's Friday filing said the SDG&E had $800M in its ""balancing account"" that it would be seeking from ratepayers. The City argued that because their were not just and reasonable rates, the filed rate doctrine is not called into question. Charles Dick I spoke with Charles Dick about his personal availability. He told me that he understood we were asking for a personal commitment from him. He has one matter that is set for arbitration in June, 2001 that will take a significant amount of this time. He has other matters, but is willing to personally commit the time necessary for this engagement. He had the same approach as in the interview- not selling himself, but being completely responsive. David Noonan David called to tell me he had left messages for Richard but they had not connected yet. In part, it was because David was in deposition. We discussed conflict issues at some length. In the copper cases where he represents SCE, they have a 1.5% and 3% share of the damages at issue. Thus, he is not acting as longstanding SCE counsel.

If for some reason this is incorrect, please let us know immediately. The subpoenas, as issued, all call for a production of documents by Wednesday October 4, 2000 unless other arrangements are made. At our face to face meeting last Friday, September 29, 2000, Michael Day and I discussed with you the practical problems associated with the Enron Entities attempting to respond within that time frame. Our understanding after that meeting is as follows: (1) The Enron Entities will not be required by the Commission to produce documents or respond to the subpoenas in any way by October 4, 2000. The Commission agrees that these entities have not waived any objections or challenges",gfergus@brobeck.com,mday@gmssr.com,"'Harvey Morris Esq.' : 'person', 'San Francisco, California 94102' : 'postal code', 'email' : 'email', 'email' : 'email', 'Michael Day' : 'person'",5,Draft Email Re PUC Subpoenas,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,sent,gfergus@brobeck.com
"Sue, Mary Hain suggested I clarify my understanding of what EES is asking for. EES is not requiring the parenthetical comment under (2) below to be included in the response. EES's key points for inclusion are: 1. Change the requirement to 90% OR 2. Apply the 95% penalty solely to underscheduling of load 3. The rule applies to an entities' entire load. 4. Smaller scheduling coordinators (i.e. smaller than the PX or IOUs) have less diverse loads and are more subject to unforeseen swings -- so 95% is very difficult to achieve -- another disincentive to direct access and competition. Is this correct?

In short, one employee's computer hard drive ran out of space related to the do not delete directive. We decided to have the employee move sufficient files from the hard drive on to the network (so they would be backed up on tape) and then authorized the employee to delete those files that had been moved to create sufficient work space so that they could do their job. We anticipate that this issue may arise again and we intend to follow the same procedure. I will call you to discuss these issues.

It is my understanding that the City of Palo Alto has agreed that in the event that Enron and the City of Palo Alto become adverse in any proceeding, then agree that our firm will have to withdraw from representation of the City of Palo Alto and that we will be able to continue to represent Enron notwithstanding the fact that they will have provided to our firm confidential information. In particular, if Enron and the City of Palo Alto become adverse in connection with the California electricity litigation (including class actions, governmental investigations and the recent decision of Enron Energy Services to transfer customers back to PG&E for physical delivery), our firm will be able to continue to represent Enron even against the City of Palo Alto. One of the reasons that the City of Palo Alto is willing to do this is that they do not believe that it is likely they will become adverse to Enron and their desire to have the specialized expertise of Larry Engel.

In response to Question No. 4, he is asking FERC to specifically to find that it is preempting investigations of last summers market, find that the rates charged were just and reasonable and determine that sellers are immune from refund under any possible legal theory. Anything less will chill the market for further investment and exacerbate the problem.

Here is the last draft of the responses to FERC's questions. It is still missing a section in response to Question 2 that Mary is drafting. I believe that Ron has minimized the concerns that I had from the prior draft. He is also swinging for a preemption home run ball in the San Diego litigation. In response to Question No. 4, he is asking FERC to specifically to find that it is preempting investigations of last summers market, find that the rates charged were just and reasonable and determine that sellers are immune from refund under any possible legal theory. Anything less will chill the market for further investment and exacerbate the problem. There is some risk if we ask for this finding and do not get it, that fact will diminish arguments we might have in state or federal court that there has been preemption.

Based upon a conversation that I had with Jeff this morning, I believe it makes sense for me to meet with Jeff in Portland to try and solve some of these problems. I want to avoid creating multiple databases and both Jeff and I believe it will be easier to resolve these issues with both the people and the information at his fingertips. I am also scheduled to meet with the Portland General traders on Wednesday to do the audit of their trading practices as we discussed when we were both last in Portland. I also plan to spend a few minutes with Tim Belden to learn what additional information he might have about my understanding of the trading practices. If you need more details, please let me know.
