"This is a bit long, but hilarious!!!!! COPIED FROM A NEWSGROUP POSTING - (the author is responding to a woman who accidentally walked into the men's restroom): Please don't feel bad. It wasn't you entering the men's washroom that caused that guy to pee on the guy next to him. Hell, we do that all the time. It's rare us guys ever hit what were aiming for. Sometimes I go into the washroom, start to pee, and then just start spinning around; just so I'll make sure I hit something. You see, something you ladies should understand by now is that men's penises have a mind of their own. A guy can go into a bathroom stall because all the urinals are being used, take perfect aim at the toilet, and his penis will still manage to piss all over the roll of toilet paper, down his left pant leg, and onto his shoe. I'm telling 'ya those little buggers can't be trusted. After being married 28 years my wife has me trained. I'm no longer allowed to pee like a man - standing up. I am required to sit down and pee. She has convinced me that this is a small price to pay. Otherwise if she had gone to the toilet one more time at night and either sat on a pee soaked toilet seat, or fell right into the toilet because I forgot to put the seat down, she was going to kill me in my sleep.

"For those who have never traveled to the great West, cattle guards are horizontal steel rails placed on the road at fence openings to prevent cattle from crossing. For some reason the bovines will not step on the guards, probably because they fear getting their feet caught between the rails. I need to make that clear in order for you to appreciate the following true story: President Clinton received a report that there were over 100,000 cattle guards in Colorado. Because Colorado ranchers protested his proposed changes in grazing policies, he ordered Secretary of Interior Bruce Babbitt to fire half of the guards immediately. Before Babbitt could respond, and presumably straighten him out, Colorado's congresswoman Pat Schroeder intervened with a request that before any were fired, they be given six months of retraining. Al Gore, never one to pass up a chance to piggy back on any story, pointed out that if the Guards had formed a strong union, such as the teachers have with the NEA, they would not be in jeopardy. ....And so it goes, in this election year. Don't you just love the smell of political napalm in the morning? We are governed by a pack of fools! What is a Goron? 1. Gorons sincerely believe that Vice President Gore is a true environmentalist, when he has an environmental disaster on his own farm: a polluting zinc mine, from which he received $500,000 of income last year. 2.

"Hey, Tonight will mark the first night of the MHEB / Eservices Off-peak Alliance. The Eservices group just signed a contract (a copy of which will be provided to you) effectuating an commercial agreement, where Enron will attempt to market a mutually agreed upon quantity of off-peak power outside of MAPP (including KCPL & MPS) above a MHEB determined reference price. In addition, if you see a bid in MAPP that is greater than the reference price, let MHEB know about it. MHEB and Eservices will share the profit(50/50) from trades done. Also, if there is a TLR, LLR curtailment MHEB will share half the cost of the transmission loss. Nature of deal: This is to be a friendly lead-in deal hopefully to be cultivated into longer term deal that will allow us access to some more lucrative products. Transacting: Call MHEB during the night shift and their real-time desk will tell you how many MW are available, and what the reference price will be. If you can sell the power for more that the reference price + transmission, inform the MHEB desk and get it done. Be careful of TLRs and ATC restrictions. MAPPF ATC Flowgate website on MAPP Oasis: Under the heading ""Flowgate ATC"", select ""Non-Firm ATC"" to check the atc for flowgates ""COOPER_S"", ""FTCAL_S"", and ""PRI-BYN"". These are the flowgates that usually cause our MAPP-F requests to be declined.

Although I think you may find some reluctance on your side to get done with us, clearly we can supply odd lots and load-following schedules into MAPP...and hopefully that gets us some leverage.

I worked closely with Joe Errigo, who has been extremely helpful in showing me the routine of the job. I received some hands on training with some of the work that is expected from the shift crew. In particular, checkouts, price discovery, identifying constraint paths, input deals into the P&L and Enpower. The demanding and fast paced nature of this position is exactly what appeals to me. My past experience with trading and scheduling should provide a good base. I would like to sit down with you and discuss opportunities within your group.

"Dear Investor, I know ""hope springs eternal,"" but please don't let it blind you to what's really going on. Tech stocks have staged a very impressive rally since October 1st. So we're out of the woods, right? We're on our way to a new bull market, right? And everything is well in technology land, right? WRONG! And if you make the same mistake I see many investors making -- and jump back in tech stocks like it's 1999 all over again -- you will likely lose your shirt. YOU SEE, much of the rise in tech stocks is attributable to ""short covering"" -- and it won't continue with the breadth and power folks are dreaming of. Why? Because the entire tech sector still has an erratic and unpredictable earnings outlook. To simplify it even further, earnings for most tech companies STINK! Tech companies -- with very few exceptions -- are drowning in red ink. And most won't have positive earnings news for the next 7-to-10 months. That's why most tech stocks -- while they've popped off their lows -- offer much greater risk than potential reward for the foreseeable future. IF YOU WANT to stay safe now -- but still earn handsome profits you can take to the bank -- you must invest in those companies I call ""EARNINGS MONSTERS."" That's the term I use for companies bucking the current trend...and GROWING their earnings anywhere from 30%-to-50%--while most companies are lucky to earn anything at all.",navellier@investorplace.com,don.baughman@enron.com,'Investor' : 'person',1,URGENT BULLETIN: Don't Make This Mistake...,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,received,don.baughman@enron.com

Here's What You Need To Know: Your Profile Your profile information, including your username (dbaughm) and password, has been transferred to the new version of eService Online. To protect your personal information, credit card information has not been transferred. You will need to update your profile. Your Itineraries Information on your reservations created before April 12th will not be saved. If you want to keep a copy for your records, you will need to print them prior to 9pm/CDT April 12th. This change does not affect the status of any previous reservations and tickets, but you can not view them in the new eService Online. Signing In To enhance security, you will have to sign in for each transaction session to reserve and purchase flights. This means you will have to use your password each time.
