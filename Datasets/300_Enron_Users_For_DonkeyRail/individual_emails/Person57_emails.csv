"Talked to Bill Reed. In his comments, he will say: FERC should be more prescriptive. Can't wait for a new board, made of new people, to act. FERC needs to be more assertive--I told him we're all for leadership from FERC. They will strongly support the end of the buy-sell requirement and express concern about the CPUC's micromanagement of utility purchases--I told him we'd have a similar message on that issue. FERC should ""PJM"" the California market--I told him we would differ significantly on that issue, i.e., PJM-ing generaly, and ""merging"" the PX and the ISO. He said his comments on ""refunds"" would be ""narrow"" and would point out that the FERC staff report says there is evidence of specific ""bad actors"" and that those bad actors should be required to give refunds--I told him that our position hasn't changed on retroactive ratemaking. I explained our position on getting more information to the market sooner. He said that it sounds like a good idea. I told him about our message on price caps. He said that he would stress that price caps ought to be a temporary ""fix,"" and should be removed just as soon as the market is ""functional.""

However, in a move led by Commissioner Carl Wood, the decision removed the Bilas language on Direct Access. The decision therefore did NOT include the Bilas language staying any Commission action on implementing the Direct Access prohibition. Carl Wood called including Direct Access ""the height of arrogance."" The decision was voted out 3-2, with the 2 remaining Republicans dissenting.

"FYI. Did we talk to Leopold? Might be useful to stress that that under noncore/core (like Direct Access), customers choose from among a host of competing providers for their service, not just Enron. Best, Jeff California Lawmakers Eye Billing Businesses for Edison Rescue By Jason Leopold ? 18:00 ET Dow Jones Business News (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) Dow Jones Newswires LOS ANGELES -- California lawmakers are mulling yet another set of ideas for rescuing embattled Southern California Edison, and this time businesses would be on the hook. In an attempt to deflect charges of a bailout that have thus far stymied efforts to restore the utility to solvency, legislators are now considering ways to shift the burden of financing the rescue from residential ratepayers to the state's largest businesses, aides to key state lawmakers said this week. The ideas being worked over by Senate President Pro Tem John Burton, Assembly Speaker Robert Hertzberg and Assemblyman Fred Keeley have yet to take shape as formal proposals. But an aide to Burton said some key lawmakers are so ""desperate"" to keep Edison International (EIX) utility Southern California Edison from following PG&E Corp. (PCG) unit Pacific Gas & Electric into bankruptcy court that they are willing to consider anything that will takse residential consumers out of the equation. ""The idea is that the large industrial customers are the ones who pushed for deregulation in the first place, so they should be responsible for bailing",jeff.dasovich@enron.com,"mpalmer@enron.com, karen.denne@enron.com, james.steffes@enron.com,

"Greetings: Look forward to it. I've just had two ""need them yesterday"" requests that I need to complete today. Are you available tomorow to discuss further? Best, Jeff Kurt Lindahl@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT 04/19/2001 01:13 PM To: Jeff Dasovich@EES cc: Michael McGarry/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT Subject: California Interstate Pipelines Jeff, My name is Kurt Lindahl. I recently joined Enron Global Markets on the LNG team. I'm the Lead Developer for the West Coast and have been charged with building a (several) LNG terminal(s) on the west coast. Michael McGarry, from Enron Engineering and Operational Services Company, is the lead Development Engineer on the project. A key question in this effort is, ""Where is the best entry point into the Socal/SG&E/PG&E pipeline systems. In other words, where can we site a LNG terminal and deliver natural gas into their systems, such that the amount of facilities they require is minimal? I spoke with Ben Asante who heads up the optimization department in ETS. He said that if we could get annual flow diagrams for the California intrastate systems, he could prepare a model in about 2 weeks time. Interstate pipelines have to file Annual Flow Diagrams at FERC, but I'm not sure what Intrastates' are obligated to file with the CPUC? That's where I need your help. This is a hot subject, because the race to site an LNG terminal is intense. Could you please call me at 713 345 5044 (O) or 713",jeff.dasovich@enron.com,kurt.lindahl@enron.com,"'Kurt Lindahl' : 'person', 'Jeff Dasovich' : 'person', 'Michael McGarry' : 'person', 'Kurt Lindahl' : 'person', 'Michael McGarry' : 'person', 'Ben Asante' : 'person', '713 345 5044 (O)' : 'phone number', '713' : 'phone number'",8,Re: California Interstate Pipelines,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,sent,jeff.dasovich@enron.com
"I think Dennis, Shawne and I were supposed to work more on #2, but since I can't recall, I'm sending to all. First, I apologize. I tried to work directly with the excellent spreadsheet Carolyn put together, but I kept fumbling, butchering, etc. So I canibalized her great stuff and created a new spreadsheet, attempting to incorporate the ""clarifications"" (yeah, right) that Prof McCullough distributed via email, and the stuff we talked about during break (i.e., timing of cash flows). The answers are at the bottom of the work sheet. And I've also included the report (though I did not peruse it for errors, relevancy, etc.). My biggest concern is question 6. My answer (despite some outliers) sez that there ain't no loan in June. (This may mean my spreadsheet's got a fatal flaw--significant probability.) Finally, doing a series of 1,000 trials resulted in some considerable variability across runs--again, could be due to screw up on my part--so the answers I generatd comes from a run of 5,000 trials. (If you run the sheet, beware, 5,000 takes some time, unless you've got DSL or something.) Let me know if this is completely out to lunch, or if you're coming up with something remotely similar.

"Please see the following important stories. It appears to be quickly slipping through Davis' fingers. May be useful to re-group a bit in light of the following events. In sum: Most importantly, in today's Chronicle, it's reported that Davis' staff met with key Democrats yesterday and lowered the boom. DWR purchases likely to be about $25 billion and rates may have to go up by 100%. (See attached story.) Apparently, one of the big reasons that 8X got held up yesterday is because Davis' own staff went to D leadership and said, ""don't move 8X (a bill that Davis was said to support) because the $10 billion cap on bonds won't work; they need much more."" It appears that rate increases will now become part of the mix, whether Davis likes it or not. The staff alleged that they were conveying the information before Davis had been informed of the ""bombshell."" Davis was criticized for being at yet another fund-raiser yesterday while the situation significantly deteroriated in Sacramento. (See attached story.) Meanwhile, PG&E has sued--or may be about to sue--the State, saying they won't pay the QFs according to Davis' plan (which the PUC is supposed to implement on Tuesday).

"State PUC Takes On High Cost Of Energy Regulators foresee more rate increases Robert Salladay, Lynda Gledhill, Chronicle Sacramento Bureau Monday, March 12, 2001 ,2001 San Francisco Chronicle URL: http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2001/03/12/M N227831.DTL Sacramento -- Starting this week, state regulators will begin debating how much is enough when it comes to asking Californians to shoulder the electricity crisis by paying higher utility rates. Right now, there doesn't appear to be enough money to go around. The state government and the utilities have racked up monumental bills because of California's flawed deregulation system. And even with recent rate increases, not enough cash is coming in to pay off the debts and buy power. Over the next three weeks, deciding how that money gets divvied up to pay the state's debt will be one of the toughest jobs of the year. State Treasurer Philip Angelides said the state Public Utilities Commission would be essentially filling a shoe box with debts and commitments during a series of meetings and workshops this month, and it's going to be a tight fit without raising power bills even more. ""The rubber hits the road in the next few weeks at the PUC,"" Angelides said. ""There is a box that has to be filled up, and a no-rate-increase scenario is putting all of these things into this box. It'll be tough work."" Under the law",jeff.dasovich@enron.com,"alan.comnes@enron.com, angela.schwarz@enron.com, beverly.aden@enron.com,

Shares of PG&E Corp. (PCG: news, msgs, alerts) , parent of Pacific Gas & Electric Co. were halted prior to the announcement. The stock fell 2 cents to $11.36 before the halt. Shares of Edison International (EIX: news, msgs, alerts) , the parent of Southern California Edison, another beleaguered California utility, plunged 20 percent to $10.05 a share. Myra P.

Then, as quickly as possible, I'd like to have a meeting to discuss and finalize the proposal. It would be very useful if Laura Tyson could be in on that final meeting, and, of course, any other of the participants that you'd like to invite. We're are somewhat behind the eight ball due to the delays thus far in getting this thing off the ground. If we're going to do it, it's going to have to come together quickly, and the report will have to be developed very quickly, too. Hope that will be possible. I'm assuming at this point that you and I are proceeding ahead absent Mitch and Carl, since they have sensitive issues with their clients that we can't seem to overcome?

"I've had several phone calls with large customer groups over the past 24-hours, mostly explaining our noncore/core proposal (in contrast to the one that the Assembly Democrats have launched which would saddle business with 100% of the utilities' past debts). As folks know, the cost shift provision of the Dems plans have been erroneously attributed to us in some cases. The business folks have been very appreciative of the discussions and have recognized that, generally, our proposal is a fair and reasonable one. They are going to try to set up direct negotiations with Hertzberg and have requested that I be part of those negotiations. They are not sure that Hertzberg will go along with the idea, but they're going to try. They will get back to me when they find out.

"FYI. Attached is a presentation on gas markets that I gave to an electricity group yesterday. The group was formed out of California's restructuring legislation (AB 1980). It's called the ""AB 1980 Implementation Group"" (I heard that the group decided that its time to change its name.). The group includes just about all of the interest groups in California. I focused on the fact that gas offers a model of a ""real"" market that California should look to in order to fix the ""artificial"" and failed electricity model created by AB 1980.

"Charles Schwab & Co., Inc. Email Alert Internet Daily for Tuesday, October 23, 2001 by Frank Barnako CBS MarketWatch.com Yahoo co-opts Explorer Yahoo introduced Tuesday an application that makes changes to the settings of Microsoft's Internet Explorer and gives preference to Yahoo's email, search and other tools. The free download program, Essentials, can make Yahoo's instant messaging tool the browser's default choice, as well as add links to Yahoo services in the Start menu of a PC running Windows. It can also make Yahoo's site the default home page for Explorer, and select the online service's email and search functions as the primary choice. Yahoo is offering Essentials ""in response to user demand,"" said Henry Sohn, vice president and general manager of network services. ----------------------------------------------------------------- AOL, Yahoo, MSN to label sites' content America Online, Microsoft Corp.'s MSN and Yahoo have adopted a system to label Web sites to help parents prevent children from viewing objectionable content. Developed by non-profit trade group Internet Content Rating Association, the labeling is included in the Web pages' coding, which can be read by Web filtering software or browsers. Content providers including Playboy.com have also labeled their sites; the ICRA began a campaign Tuesday to encourage others to do so. ""Creating safer places for children to use the Internet has long been a part of the overall experience Yahoo provides, and working with the industry to develop the ICRA standard and labeling protocol is just the next step in our efforts,"" said Srinija Srinivasan, vice president and editor-in-chief. ----------------------------------------------------------------- Net access",schwabalerts.marketupdates@schwab.com,jeff.dasovich@enron.com,"'Frank Barnako' : 'person', 'Henry Sohn' : 'person', 'Srinija Srinivasan' : 'person'",3,"Internet Daily for October 23, 2001",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,received,jeff.dasovich@enron.com
"Charles Schwab & Co., Inc. Email Alert Internet Daily for Thursday, November 1, 2001 by Frank Barnako CBS MarketWatch.com Ecommerce crawls back from Sept. 11 Renewed interest in travel is helping online shopping activity reach a pace not seen since the terrorist attacks of September. Hotwire.com, a discount travel service, said it has registered 1 million new users since the tragedy. Daily sales and transactions are equal to those of the weeks prior to Sept. 11, said Hotwire president Karl Peterson. ComScore Networks reported similar results in its weekly survey of Internet users' transaction data. Travel category product sales were 6% below pre-attack levels, the Reston, Va., research firm said. During the week ending Oct. 28, total domestic ecommerce sales were $974 million, 2% below the average for five weeks prior to Sept. 11. Don Hess, ComScore vice president, said, ""We suspect the needle is starting to move in holiday shopping, perhaps earlier than the industry might expect."" ----------------------------------------------------------------- Internet World rescheduled to December The ninth annual Internet World conference will be held Dec. 10-14 at the Jacob Javits Convention Center in New York City.

"Jeff: You are quite correct about the facts of the arrangement. However, between the previous fixed price deal we did on the alternative settlement and this most recent agreement, we have lost $10,000 plus $12,500 for a total of $22,500 on this one case. In both situations, our hours were required by the expanded press of the work in the hearing, and the uncertainty that is involved in estimating the cost of hearing work is always difficult to deal with. As you will no doubt recall, on our last arrangement, I provided an estimate that was much closer to what we have acutally spent on the GRI hearing and briefing to date, which you then proceeded to propose paring on an essentially arbitrary basis. I unable to plead anything other than brain disfunction as to why I agreed with your numbers, which I knew would be too low. So here we are. In response to your proposal, I offer two suggestions, one: we should split the difference between the estimate and the actuals to date. That would mean you would pay $19,761 of the current balance. On that basis, we would prepare written comments and lobby for the proposed decision when it comes out at no additional cost. Two: you pay only the $15,000 that you propose ($13,500 plus the extra $1500), but we clean the slate and start over on the file and any written comments or lobbying on the proposed decision are paid for on a straight hourly basis. I think either solution is fair to both sides.
