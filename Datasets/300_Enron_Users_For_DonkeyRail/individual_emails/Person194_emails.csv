"CAN NEW YORK AVOID CALIFORNIA'S BLACKOUTS? Monday,April 2,2001 By WILLIAM TUCKER WILL New York be able to avoid a California-type power shortage this summer? Right now, the odds look pretty good. A lot depends right now on whether Mayor Giuliani can keep his mouth shut. Last week, the mayor departed from his Republican principles for a moment to advocate ""temporary"" price controls on wholesale electricity in the Northeast. ""The double-digit price increases that New Yorkers had to pay last summer are just unacceptable,"" said Giuliani at a press conference. ""Deregulation should not be abandoned, it should be completed. The problem is when we deregulated we didn't think it would affect us so quickly. We need a little adjustment right now."" Ah yes, just a teeny-weenie little adjustment just to get us through the next few months, right? Just like rent control - a ""temporary wartime measure"" imposed in 1943. Price controls are never temporary. They just make things worse by producing shortages. And the more shortages they produce, the more people agitate for more regulations. It's a vicious cycle that eventually becomes almost impossible to escape. California is having blackouts right now because, until this week at least, the public and political officials were unwilling to accept a rate increase. (Before last week, Gov. Gray Davis' major power-conservation achievement was having ""energy savings tips"" printed on McDonald's placemats.",janel.guerrero@enron.com,"richard.shapiro@enron.com, james.steffes@enron.com, mark.palmer@enron.com,

"Greetings everyone, I thought it would be useful to send you this email as a follow up to the meeting we had last week with the IPPNY PR Working Group. Background As you know our efforts to form a PR campaign as the Empire State Energy Suppliers fell apart at the end of May. Since then, I have been working with Sharon Stewart at Brown Olson and Wilson in order to pay SSK for their services from April 1, 2001 to May 31, 2001. We are waiting for one last invoice (May expenses) from SSK. Once we receive this invoice, Brown Olson & Wilson will send a lump-sum payment to SSK. I will get you the total cost of SSK's services for April/May but $200,000 is an approximate number. This comes to about $22,000 per each of the 9 companies that participated in the effort. As you will recall, we each sent $25K to the Escrow account. IPPNY PR Working Group Given the high profile of energy issues in NY, and the increasing dialogue taking place there a coordinated PR effoert can certainly be justified. Those of us who participated in ESES, whose companies are also members of IPPNY, met last week in Albany to discuss whether IPPNY would be willing to expand their PR efforts if we joined forces. (Thanks to all of you who were able to attend and participate in the meeting). Since last week - Gavin Donohue, and the IPPNY Board of Directors, have given their full support to this expanded effort, and we are moving foward with ",janel.guerrero@enron.com,"rcarrado@pwrteam.com, hal.chappelle@mirant.com, jdandrea@keyspanenergy.com,

"PG&E could face mutiny on outages: SMUD, others may balk if utility orders summer blackouts By Carrie Peyton Bee Staff Writer (Published March 7, 2001) Sacramento's electric utility wants out of a deal that imposes rolling blackouts locally on PG&E's command. So do a lot of other utilities. They've been writing letters, lobbying lawmakers and launching informal talks with Pacific Gas and Electric Co. to get off the hook before summer. Who dodges the blackout bullet ""is going to play out as a political hot button"" around the state, said George Fraser, head of the Northern California Power Agency, a coalition of municipal utilities. In Sacramento, the next volley is expected soon, with the Sacramento Municipal Utility District reportedly poised to notify PG&E that it will no longer black out homes and businesses on the larger utility's command. ""We are absolutely trying to fight off the requirement for rolling blackouts for the Sacramento area,"" said Linda Davis, one of seven elected members of the SMUD board of directors. Saying they don't want to be dragged down by somebody else's problems, two Southern California utilities have written grid operators asking to be exempted from any blackouts caused by PG&E's or Southern California Edison's financial woes. But in PG&E's view, ""California is in an energy crisis (and) ... we're all in this together,"" said spokesman John Nelson.

"Steve: I want to thank you for recently creating the new Environment Health & Safety division. I think the reorganization and dedicated focus will benefit the entire company. I know that in the past I was often critical of the previous situation, and while I didn't necessarily enjoy complaining about it I thought it was important to show you the inefficiencies of what we were experiencing. But what a difference Mike has made! In just a few weeks he has met on an individual and group basis with key people involved in ""environmental"" issues. He appears organized, and is doing a great job at sifting through the issues and prioritizing them. He seems genuinley interested in working with us as a team to develop goals and is enthusiastic and supportive of our ideas and suggestions. We had a Clean Air Act meeting in DC this week which was well attended by our commercial people. The Environment Health & Safety Council also met yesterday and I think finally, this group will do more than just talk. Everyone was very excited at the end of the day. Having said all of that, I also want to share some news with you. Ed Baughman and Greg Woulfe asked me to join the emissions desk and yesterday I accepted the mid-marketer position which will report to Ed. The timing is a little ironic, given the changes you just implemented but I am looking forward to some much-needed commercial experience. Without getting too sentimental, I want you to know that I have really enjoyed working for you and Rick.

"Two weeks ago, Phil Harris sent a letter to the CEOs of PJM member-companies urging them to designate a representative to participate in PJM's Communications Group. The initial step would be to highlight the four years of success in the PJM wholesale market and enhance the public's confidence in the value of competitive electric markets. Since Enron has already committed money to EPSA's multi-state communications effort as well as an aggressive communications plan in NY, I thought it would be useful to meet with PJM's manager of communications to try and get a better idea of what they are trying to achieve. On Friday, June 1st, I met with Beth Foley -- PJM's Manager of Communications. Beth is new to PJM. The bottom line is that PJM has never had a communications office. Press inquiries and other external communications have been handled from PJM's customer care center. This year, PJM decided it needed to create a new division to deal soley with communications/pr issues. As of last week, 35 member companies had responded to the letter from Phil Harris. The next step is likely to be a meeting of all the interested companies in PA. They're starting from ground zero, so I shared some of Enron's experiences in NY and DC with her: Research is useful in order to define message points, and keep the effort focused Many companies are being asked to fund various ""communications plans"" as a result of the CA fallout.

"The IPPNY/SSK communications effort for NY is finally a go! Since I will be on a train from Philly to NYC tomorrow during the Leadership call the following is a quick summary of what's going on in NY. IPPNY/EPSA Gavin Donohue, Mark Stultz and myself met Tuesday for lunch and discussed each organizations' communications efforts and the need for coordination given the overlap in membership, the dual focus on NYC, and the costs involved. The EPSA effort is a ""reassurance"" campaign for states who have already begun deregulation but who might be nervous to proceed after witnessing the CA debacle. EPSA is working with the Chamber of Commerce and is focused on four markets (Boston, NYC, Baltimore and DC). EPSA contracted with a PR firm out of Austin, TX and they have already developed 3 broadcast advertising spots (Mark is on the steering committee and should have access to the spots) EPSA shared the spots with SSK and IPPNY yesterday (which SSK didn't like very much) The ads would run on PBS and cable - the media buys have not been purchased yet. Apparently EPSA developed the ads and are running them past focus groups as we speak Interestingly enough, the spot which they developed for the eastern states used the word deregulation over and over (a word that is not popular here). AND when tested among the opinion elites - they didn't know who PJM was!!

"Janel: In response to your request, here are some of the key themes that Ken is using that should be kept in mind in our advertising and other external efforts. Let me know if there are other themes that we should be thinking about. 1) energy is the ""master resource."" 1.6 billion people don't have modern energy such as electricity, and the rest of the world needs increasing amounts of power in the IT age where bits are electrons and many new applications of power are emerging. Reliability requirements are also way up in the IT age (more ""9s"" of reliability). 2) Infrastructure must expand to meet growing demand or price spikes can occur. Price spikes lead to emergency fixes that are more costly and more polluting than if infrastructure was added in a more timely way. For example, in California the lack of modern new gas-fired capacity has forced the state to run its older, more polluting gas plants more. 3) Electricity is a very volatile commodity--risk management tools are needed to meet customer expectations and avoid situations creating political opportunism and strife between buyers and sellers. 4) The short run answer to shortages is real time pricing to bring demand down to meet available supply in the peak periods. 5) Price controls create shortages and require further government involvement to ration supply. 6) Natural gas is the fuel of choice for new power generation capacity for economic and environmental reasons. The resource base is robust, and gas (and LNG) could even over time displace much or all of the coal capacity of the United States.

"Hi, Janel, I thought that I initialed those already. If I didn't, I'll do it when I get back after my vacation next week. In the meantime, go ahead and forward them to the counterparty for signatures on both originals and then have someone at VP level sign for Corp. If I didn't initial, you should get them initialed before giving them to the corporate officer, because company policy requires attorney initials on all legal documents before signature. Once signed, the original goes to the vault; we can take care of that for you. I'll be out next week, but if you have questions, please call Diane Goode, who works in my group.

"Janel: In response to your request, here are some of the key themes that Ken is using that should be kept in mind in our advertising and other external efforts. Let me know if there are other themes that we should be thinking about. 1) energy is the ""master resource."" 1.6 billion people don't have modern energy such as electricity, and the rest of the world needs increasing amounts of power in the IT age where bits are electrons and many new applications of power are emerging. Reliability requirements are also way up in the IT age (more ""9s"" of reliability). 2) Infrastructure must expand to meet growing demand or price spikes can occur. Price spikes lead to emergency fixes that are more costly and more polluting than if infrastructure was added in a more timely way. For example, in California the lack of modern new gas-fired capacity has forced the state to run its older, more polluting gas plants more. 3) Electricity is a very volatile commodity--risk management tools are needed to meet customer expectations and avoid situations creating political opportunism and strife between buyers and sellers. 4) The short run answer to shortages is real time pricing to bring demand down to meet available supply in the peak periods. 5) Price controls create shortages and require further government involvement to ration supply. 6) Natural gas is the fuel of choice for new power generation capacity for economic and environmental reasons. The resource base is robust, and gas (and LNG) could even over time displace much or all of the coal capacity of the United States.

"Janel: In response to your request, here are some of the key themes that Ken is using that should be kept in mind in our advertising and other external efforts. Let me know if there are other themes that we should be thinking about. 1) energy is the ""master resource."" 1.6 billion people don't have modern energy such as electricity, and the rest of the world needs increasing amounts of power in the IT age where bits are electrons and many new applications of power are emerging. Reliability requirements are also way up in the IT age (more ""9s"" of reliability). 2) Infrastructure must expand to meet growing demand or price spikes can occur. Price spikes lead to emergency fixes that are more costly and more polluting than if infrastructure was added in a more timely way. For example, in California the lack of modern new gas-fired capacity has forced the state to run its older, more polluting gas plants more. 3) Electricity is a very volatile commodity--risk management tools are needed to meet customer expectations and avoid situations creating political opportunism and strife between buyers and sellers. 4) The short run answer to shortages is real time pricing to bring demand down to meet available supply in the peak periods. 5) Price controls create shortages and require further government involvement to ration supply. 6) Natural gas is the fuel of choice for new power generation capacity for economic and environmental reasons. The resource base is robust, and gas (and LNG) could even over time displace much or all of the coal capacity of the United States.
