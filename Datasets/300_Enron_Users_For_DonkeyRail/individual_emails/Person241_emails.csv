"Attached is a revised version of the Posting Agreement that S&C provided to us. I have tried to incorporate some additional provisions and inserted a few ""place-savers"" to mark some areas where we need to discuss the agreement further; for instance, under what circumstances has a party ""defaulted"" -- and should at least be liable for the other party's out-of-pocket expenses incurred in establishing the interfaces as well as give the other party the right to terminate the agreement -- and under what circumstances should either party be able to walk away (such as, it just doesn't work)? Many of these provisions will be ""fleshed out"" more when the technical considerations are added, and when we sit down with the counterparty to negotiate this Agreement. Hopefully the attached gives you something to meet with S&C on Wednesday. Again, I can participate by phone if any of you think it would be helpful.

"Jim -- the following are our concerns about PG&E's proposal/possible points to make in a response: 1. Enron would be one of the largest unsecured creditors in the event of a PG&E bankruptcy; our claim may become even larger depending on the extent to which we acquire additional claims against the utilities through the PX or ISO. We are therefore interested in any action that would reduce the pool of assets available to unsecured creditors. 2. This proposal may be to our benefit, or to our detriment. There is not a great deal of detail in the proposal currently on the table, and Enron needs additional information in order to evaluate the proposal. Certainly, we need to evaluate this in light of other developments. 3. The proposal contemplates pledging ""existing and future"" receivables to secure obligations owed to gas suppliers; PGE shows approx. $1.3 billion in A/R as of 9/30; will that (or an amount of like magnitude) be pledged as security under this plan? Granting gas suppliers security may be fine with us, but we don't have a great interest in OVER-collateralizing their positions. More current information on the current A/R balances and the extent to which obligations to suppliers will be secured will be helpful. 4. Do they intend to extend this security to ALL gas suppliers, or only those that are refusing to supply PGE under current circumstances? 5. Do they intend to secure obligations on a going-forward basis only, or will they",travis.mccullough@enron.com,james.steffes@enron.com,'Jim' : 'person',1,PGE -- Securing gas suppliers issue,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,sent,travis.mccullough@enron.com
"Attached is a revised version of the CA with Goldman. The remaining issue is in Section 1 regarding restrictions on Goldman's ""use"" of the Confidential Information. Goldman believes that they will have to bring a lot of their personnel, including traders, ""over the wall"" in order to perform this engagement, and that such personnel will by necessity see some of our Confidential Information. While they agree that their personnel shouldn't be able to use our specific information against us in future transactions, they are worried that the restriction on their use of our info that is set out in Section 1 could limit the future activities of those folks simply because they ""saw"" some of our Confidential Information and are carrying it around in their heads, and at any time could be accused of ""using"" our info. Initially, Goldman insisted on removing the restriction on use. We have suggested the language at the end of Section , which would generally restrict use of the information to the engagement, but would allow Goldman's non-IB's to work on the deal but perform their other jobs without worrying about violating the CA as long as they weren't using the notes that they took while they were in our shop. Admittedly, it is not as clean as I would like, but I think this adequately addresses both parties' concerns.

"Thanks for forwarding the request for no-action letter. I'll review it with Mark. It seems that the suggested policy should not be problematic for us. We would just want to make sure that nothing in the policy could be construed to prevent Enron from conducting the very activities that are contemplated by the Posting Agreement. Since the only information we should be getting through our relationship with True Quote (absent a board seat) is information from potential EnronOnline counterparties hitting our prices (and it would be the same information, and no more, that we would be receiving if the party were dealing directly with EnronOnline), it seems unlikely that we could ever be in a position to violate a policy that True Quote would adopt.

I was hoping you could give us a little guidance on tracking down some Indian legal issues -- perhaps a reference to someone that could assist us. Clickpaper.com is Enron's electronic trading marketplace for pulp, paper and lumber products (including derivative products). It is modeled after EnronOnline, but specializes in these commodities. The team is in the process of registering customers around the world to access and trade on the Clickpaper website; in keeping with the EOL business model, Clickpaper enters into access and trading agreements with every customer that govern their use of and trading on the site. Those access and trading agreements are ""jurisdiction specific"" -- customized for the particular country in which the customer accessing the site is based -- in order to deal with jurisdiction-specific legal issues associated with accessing, or contracting via, the internet, financial trading, regulatory issues, etc. The team has identified India as having a large number of potential customers, and is attending a trade show in New Delhi in early December, and they would like to be able to sign customers up at that trade show, or at the very least arrange to give them access to the site. We therefore need to consult with legal counsel in India to identify any issues and prepare an apporpriate access and trading agreement.

"Andy - We wanted to keep you in the loop on all of the Kiodex documents -- attached are copies of the Stockholders' Agreement, the Stock Purchase Agreement, and the Warrant Agreement that we are preparing to send out to Kiodex for their review (these incorporate our comments to Kiodex' drafts). Our comments to these documents were consistent with the approach that we took in the HoustonStreet and TrueQuote deals. This is actually the second round of comments that we are sending in -- this round of comments is to reflect the new structure that we needed to implement to get the desired accounting treatment, which we have already discussed with Kiodex. Since it is just a follow up to comments we have already sent, we will probably go ahead and send them out to Kiodex, but there will be more than enough time to get any comments you may have in front of Kiodex as well.

Mark ----- Forwarded by Mark E Haedicke/HOU/ECT on 07/12/2000 09:46 AM ----- ENA Office of the Chairman@ENRON Sent by: Enron NA Office of the Chairman@ENRON 07/10/2000 05:50 PM To: ENA Employees cc: Subject: ENA Meeting and Event Expenditure Approval Process The approval process initiated in 1998 for all meeting and event expenditures in excess of $5,000 has enabled ENA to better assess the business value of events, accurately track our activities and save money. These events include customer and employee meetings, and trade shows. ENA has made some modifications to the process, which are described in this memo. The $5,000 threshold remains in effect for all customer events. However, the threshold for approval for employee meetings and events has been lowered to $2,000, and some additional requirements must be met prior to approval. Please be sure to follow the procedures described below for all meetings and events, so we can continue to successfully manage these events. 1) Prior to making any commitments to customers or vendors, all customer events with anticipated costs in excess of $5,000, and all employee events with anticipated costs in excess of $2,000 must be reviewed by the ENA Public Relations (PR) department and approved by the ENA Office of the Chairman 2) The PR department will handle the site search and hotel contract negotiations for all such events. Once this is completed, the PR department will work with you to plan and produce your event in its entirety; or they can provide as",mark.haedicke@enron.com,travis.mccullough@enron.com,'Mark E Haedicke' : 'person',1,ENA Meeting and Event Expenditure Approval Process,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,received,travis.mccullough@enron.com
