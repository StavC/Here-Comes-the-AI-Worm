"Joe and Louise: I was on a conf call today re ERC Financing. Legal and Finance were on the call. The consensus was that it would be difficult. The structure involves selling the ERC's at market to an entity controlled by the bank; buying a call from that entity; selling a put to that entity; having a price swap (fixed/floating) with entity. The bank would also want to understand market liquidity, price transparency and the rules of every district we have ERC's in. The Texas SOX deal recently put into this vehicle was much simpler in a more liquid market, but it took 4 months and $1MM of legal fees to put together. The lawyers involved believe that it would be more difficult and likely more expensive for the California ERC's - we have several districts and several products. $1MM+ internal resources seems like a lot for a $20MM-$30MM balance with an expected term of one year - especially with uncertain success due to the price transparency issues (no index price).

"Louise, I have a bit of an issue with this because the power and gas objectives seem to take a backseat to the EOL objectives. For example, bradford said he will not get to my request for my top power counterparties for a couple of weeks because he has a top-50 eol list that he is working on. There are a lot of counterparties that are important that do not necessarily use EOL.

"Steve, I think you may have heard a request last week re working closely with Dynegy. I think we just need to treat them like other counterparties. Basically, West Power would like to enter into arms length physical power and service transactions with Dynegy. My understanding is that Dynegy is a separate, unrelated party until the merger closes. Therefore, we can not ""collaborate"" with them commercially and our transaction policy is dictated by customary credit, legal and risk management procedures. Is this correct? If so, how do you feel about the following? An Enron customer wants to buy power and related services for one year. The customer requires Enron to post collateral. Enron does not want to post collateral but suggests that Enron can provide the product/services to Dynegy and Dynegy can then sell to the customer. The Enron marketer calls the Dynegy marketer and proposes a ""back to back"" transaction. Dynegy adds a small service fee, the Enron/Dynegy contract is executed and a Dynegy/Customer contract is executed. This type of deal happens frequently - it is usually driven by the third party having better credit, transmission access or a complementary service. We could do this with anyone, but the obvious choice is Dynegy - customers think it makes sense, and ultimately if we merge we have retained a customer. Do you think this works?

"Louise, This is incomplete with some bids expected next week. A lot of companies had a late start due to the 4th of July holiday so they have been whining this week about an extension. Bids are preliminary and based solely on the info memo. Bids are in addition to all sunk costs: McCook Metals - $20MM (this is an ongoing, slow negotiation) PPL Global - $15MM Reliant $10MM Indicated that they will submit bid later today/over weekend/early next week: Calpine Allegheny AES Sempra Williams El Paso NRG Dynegy I expect some of these wont show up. Out for various reasons: Mirant Constellation Entergy FPL PG&E Orion PSEG Tractabel If we end up with 5-6 positive bids, even if they are non-binding, I think it supports risking additional capital to get this project fully developed/sold (DASH in process). One interesting note: Allegheny wants to see our offer. If we have several reasonable bids ($10-$20), it might make sense to offer a high outlier. I will update.

The bond sale stalled last week when the California Public Utilities Commission voted 4-1 against a plan to repay the state's power costs using utility rates. The commissioners favor another approach, opposed by Davis, that would give them more authority over the state's $43 billion of power contracts. Some commissioners ``would probably be amenable to the rate agreement if there was movement on the governor's part to renegotiate those contracts,'' said Geoffrey Brown, who was appointed to the PUC by Davis. ``We're not just sitting around waiting for the sky to fall.

"Davis devises new borrowing plan His executive order could speed up $12.5 billion in bond sales and bypass PUC oversight of repayment mechanism. SACRAMENTO -- Gov. Gray Davis is crafting a new plan to expedite the long-delayed borrowing of $12.5 billion to repay the sagging California state budget for emergency electricity it bought during the energy crisis. The plan -- which could be contained in an executive order as early as next week -- would minimize the role of the state's top power regulator, the Public Utilities Commission, which enraged Davis last week when it declined to sign off on his original plan. With enough power now under contract to avert blackouts and plans in place for the recovery of the two state's largest utilities, the repayment to the state treasury would resolve one of the last remaining issues of the energy crisis. ""That is one scenario,"" Davis spokeswoman Hilary McLean said Wednesday when asked about the proposal. ""There are a number of different scenarios being considered. Nothing has jelled yet that is ready to be publicly announced."" Most involved in the debate have long agreed that the state should sell $12.5 billion in revenue bonds, most of which, about $9.6 billion, would go back into the state treasury. The issue was how to lock in a mechanism by which the bonds would be repaid - a critical step before they could be marketed to investors. Davis wanted the PUC to approve a plan that would repay the bonds and cover the state's energy",jeff.dasovich@enron.com,f..calger@enron.com,"'Gov.

He said that as CFO he is head of the Risk Management Committee and that anything that was discussed with Bill would go through his committee. I highlighted the notion that we were interested in talking about services that could be helpful to their risk management efforts and that would be beneficial to both of our companies. By the way, at the beginning of the call, I made clear that we were not talking about total outsourcing. He didn't immediately respond, but in the context of our discussion re: who to talk to he stated that we should talk to him if we wanted to have a more strategic discussion on outsourcing.

This would keep a lot of orig/tech/finance people employed for a while in order to manage it and then work off the pieces. This looks like a fairly impressive private asset company - they appear to be good developers, acquirers, etc. They even say that they that restructured 8 of their PPA's - presumably they restructured the ones that make sense - further reduces our restructuring proposition. To me, the QF optionality goes like this: - If you have a high-variable cost QF that operates as a baseload facility, the math works to shut it down or convert to a peaking PPA when the market is low. - If the market is high, you have an easy-to-develop expansion. Problem is, their assets appear to have low variable costs (coal and new gas) so the restructuring play does not jump out at me ...and we are bearish on development At PV18, this could look like a good diversified low risk business - superior to most of our regulated businesses and most of our international businesses, but I think it would be real tough to get returns >30%.
