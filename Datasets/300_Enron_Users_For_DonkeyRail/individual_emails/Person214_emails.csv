Certain items have been left blank, including price and shipment dates. GE told me that the $39,970,000 per turbine set number is still the notional price based on the GenPower Dell scope. This aforementioned scope means that we will need to purchase an extra static starter ($900,000) and a water wash skid ($150,000) to take two sets of two turbines and split them up intop three projects (Longview, Ft Pierce, Fla Peaker). As usual, things like dual fuel ($2 MM), peaker stacks ($1.5-2MM) and inlet cooling options are scope additions and are not included in the MSRP. Please get me your comments as soon as possible to keep the process moving. We can use this term sheet with business points discussed with GE to get the DASh process moving. Shipment dates are still uncertain. GE will try and accomadate us with turbines that will work for combined cycle as well as peakers for summer 2003 start dates. We will not know what (if any) turbines that we will get until GE goes into their DASH process next week.

If not, I can draft a letter and send it to you. I asked about how the client intends to deal with GE, and was told that after a winning bidder is selected, they intend to seek GE's consent. The only other tid bit I have is that I called Schroeder to ask if any units were coming available, and he swore up and down that he did not know of any.

Ben -----Original Message----- From: Mann, Kay Sent: Wednesday, May 30, 2001 6:36 PM To: Krimsky, Steven; Jacoby, Ben Subject: Deerfield development agreement Here are my initial comments: There's no clear triggering event which would expedite the internal approval process. For instance, paragraph 3 is a current obligation (re landscaping). It would be easier to process this agreement if the effectiveness of this agreement commences when we file for a building permit. I understand that we would have to pay some of this prior to the time the permit is issued, but again, magic words help. Paragraph 6 on right of first refusal for power. Looks like a free call for the next 30 years. Just want to make sure you've bought in on this.

"Fred / Kay: I spoke to Duran this morning, and he and I would like to meet together with us to discuss the Midway project and whether or not we will be able to utilize TurboPark Phase 2. I previously told him that because of timing considerations and because there may be certain agreements that will be difficult to make TurboPark compliant (such as the attached interconnect agreement from FPL), that Phase 2 may not be practical for purposes of this project. I think this would be a good discussion to have on Friday, because we should have more information on the GE7FAs and should have already spoken with TECO on their proposed MOU (and maybe even the tolling agreement). What are your schedules on Friday? I also would like to schedule a call for tomorrow with TECO to go over the MOU. Fred - Please coordinate with Kay and schedule something with Becky Alex.

"Folks: I just got off the phone with Lee Johnson at GE. I described the overall deal to him (""Intergen"" style deal with the current 4 LV Cogen units, and a purchase of 4 additional units as a replacement), but did not disclose that the counterparty is Panda. Lee is totally on board, and thought this would be a great transaction. Based on this, I think our GE risk is minimal, which means that our primary commercial focus needs to be on making sure Panda is prepared to transact, and if they remain as interested, making sure we proceed with as simple a transaction as possible. I would suggest that we have an all hands conference call to discuss the transaction as soon as possible. Fred-could you please contact everyone and set this up?

"Louise: Apologies, but I forgot to mention a couple items on Florida on this morning's call. With respect to our Florida development book, and the Midway site in particular, we have 4 value propositions that we're working on. We talked about the first one, which relates to the sale of the development asset (with a target gross sales price of $13 million). The others are as follows: 1. Leverage site positions to bid into FPL's recently announced 1,700MW RFP. 2. Leverage site positions to negotiate third party long term tolling contracts for unit contingent power. 3. Leverage site positions to build a merchant power plant. On item 1, we have been speaking with FPL for some time, and we think we may have a competitive advantage (because of the number and maturity of our development assets) to offer a unit contingent contract to FPL, or simply a sale of one or more sites. If we were awarded a contract, we could go in the market, buy turbines, and flip the package (a la LV Cogen). Heather Kroll and I are working on this together. On item 2, I was contacted by Williams a couple of weeks ago. They indicated they were interested in a 10 to 15 year tolling contract off our Midway site. We have since signed a confidentiality agreement, and are discussing indicative terms. As with item 1, if we negotiated a deal with Williams, we could go in the market, buy turbines, and flip the package. Aquila is also a prospect for this type of deal, as they are seeking long term toll",ben.jacoby@enron.com,louise.kitchen@enron.com,"'Louise' : 'person', 'Heather Kroll' : 'person', 'Williams' : 'person', 'Williams' : 'person', 'Aquila' : 'person'",5,Follow-up to this mornings meeting,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,sent,ben.jacoby@enron.com

The deal that we are on the path of closing is consistent with the executed DASH and works as follows: at the signing of the letter agreement, NW pays ENA $3 million, with another $5 million paid on July 15 (the Turbine Deposits). The balance of $40 million is paid by NW at such time as the assignment of the turbine contract is made to the LLC, and ENA sells the LLC member interests to NW. The outside date for this to occur, via a notice provided by NW, is Sept. 1. The $8 million paid by NW, and the obligation to purchase the member interests is a firm commitment guaranteed by Northwestern Corp. The only condition to NW's obligation to purchase the member interests is that ENA effect the assignment of the turbine contract into the LLC. If ENA does not effect the assignment, then NW would also be entitled to a return of the $8 million in Turbine Deposits.

"Hi Ben, Just wanted you to know that I received your email, and will follow through on the change order. I should be in the office on Thursday am, if not sooner. As you can see, I'm picking up email, and can also be reached on my cell phone. I reviewed your email re: VEPCO. We do have a project entity to use, and Accounting (and Global Finace) have been involved on the MTM and off balance sheet issues. I suspect we will find out about the need for a guarantee soon. It was good to get your input on VEPCO. There's lots to do on that one.
