"Doug, we will need to have this document along with the evaluation reviewed by legal prior to presenting to the employee. Attached is a Performance Improvement Plan for your employee(s) who rated in the bottom cluster. The steps below outline the instructions for completing this form. If you have any questions, please contact your HR Representative - Supervisors are encouraged to consider employee input before finalizing the PIP. - The PIP should address the specific performance areas and examples provided in the employee's evaluation. - All PIP's should be reviewed by your Human Resources generalist before being presented to the employee. Performance/Development Area: This is the specific area in which the employee's demonstrated performance needs to improve, or a significant area where additional development is needed. These should be stated in specific, objective, and behavioral terms. Common descriptors have been provided for the supervisor to copy/paste into the Performance Improvement Plan or to modify as needed. See attachment. Specific Action Required: The desired behavior or action of employee. This should usually be a goal or milestone that can be measured or evaluated. Completion Date: Each specific action in the PIP will require varying time periods for completion. Some improvement areas may need to be immediate, such as reducing absenteeism or eliminating inappropriate comments. Other areas will take longer for the employee to complete, such as enhancing technical knowledge. Supervisors are encouraged to avoid lengthy completion dates, while giving the employee sufficient time to demonstrate improvement.

Christina had passed along to Liz the various points I made at the meeting last week, so Liz was prepared to address our primary concerns. She made the following points: (1) She has talked with several different people at various levels of authority in Calpine's trading area, and insists that Calpine treats the power grids as ""completely different"" regions, strategies for which are not shared internally among those regions. (2) She asserts that ""how we do it at Calpine is totally different from Enron,"" since Calpine is ""trading around a portfolio of assets that we own."" She asserted that Enron, not owning power generation assets, trades differently. When I replied that Enron does have power generation assets, she acknowledged the fact but insisted that Enron's trading style is vastly different due to the difference in emphasis vis a vis the power generation assets. (3) Liz claims that Miller works almost exclusively in ""Urcot"" (sp??) in Texas, with some participation in Entergy in Louisiana.

"Kathy, I am the ENA attorney assisting Ozzie Pagan (ENA East Origination) and Glenn Wright (Enron Industrial Markets) with the acquisition of two Cogentrix's coal fired power plants located in North Carolina. I understand from Kathy Neal that you are the appropriate person to be involved in the employee/labor due diligence efforts that were initiated by Dolores ""Dee"" Lenfest and then transferred to Kathy Neal. If I am mistaken in believing that you are currently conducting such due diligence with Cogentrix's HR representative, would you please contact Glenn Wright immediately at 3-1568. I hope there is no misunderstanding of what is needed or who is supposed to be assisting, but if there is, we need to get that figured out today. Thanks for your help.
