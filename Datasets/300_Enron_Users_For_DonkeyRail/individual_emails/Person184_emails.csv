Our database environment was upgraded from a 32-bit version of Oracle 8.1.7.2 to the 64-bit version. This upgrade increases the maximum size of memory cache available to our applications from 4Gb to 25Gb. Apps that cache large amounts of data will experience reductions in physical I/O thereby increasing application speed. Once again, this change represents one of many short-term steps to improve the performance of our core wholesale trading system.

To help facilitate this new business, we need to setup several new pub codes that represent the indexes the California ISO publishes for ancillary services. A few of the ancillary pub codes are already setup we just need to add the ones for spin & non-spin. Do you know who we need to get with to have these new pub codes setup? I will work with the IT guys to ensure the programs that scrape the ISO site and store the prices are updated to capture these new indexes. Thanks, David Poston ps - Please give me a call if you have any questions, 57834 These pub codes already exist: ISOGRRNP15 (CAL ISO GENERATION REPLACEMENT RESERVE @ NP-15) ISOLRRNP15 (CAL ISO LOAD REPLACEMENT RESERVE @ NP-15) Repeat for SP-15 Repeat for ZP-26 These pub codes need to be created: ISOGSRNP15 (CAL ISO GENERATION SPINNING RESERVE @ NP-15) ISOLSRNP15 (CAL ISO LOAD REPLACEMENT RESERVE @ NP-15) Repeat for SP-15 Repeat for ZP-26 ISOGNRNP15 (CAL ISO GENERATION NON-SPINNING RESERVE @ NP-15) ISOLNRNP15 (CAL ISO LOAD NON-SPIN",w..white@enron.com,david.poston@enron.com,"'Stacey White' : 'person', 'Poston, David' : 'person', 'Richter, Jeff' : 'person', 'Jeff Richter' : 'person', 'David Poston' : 'person'",5,RE: New Pub Codes for Enpower,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,sent,w..white@enron.com

"Stacey, I have reviewed the section on the attachment of counterparties on the master log with a ""Y"" but not on the physical power terminated list. BP Energy Company is on the physical power terminated list. With the exception of the four new companies that appeared on the master list today and Ameren, we do not have any trades flowing after December 1, 2001 with the other counterparties. I have not been including counterparties on the list if we don't have any deals flowing December 2001 on out. If I need to include companies that we don't have outstanding trades with let me know. Niagara Mohawk has been purchased by Select Energy New York, Inc. Tonight Global Counterparty is going to replace the Niagara Mohawk name with Select Energy New York, Inc. I have been waiting on global before adding Select to the termination list. I have not heard back on Ameren yet. Once I have an answer from David on the other terminations (by alternate source) I will let you know. Thanks for organizing the information from all of the e-mails.

The energy they get credit (assured energy) come from the Energy Reallocation Mechanism or MRE. All hydro generators are member of this mechanism, which is regulated by ANEEL. MRE's objective is to optimize the cost of hydro generation. So, regardless the energy generated by the plant, it always gets the assured energy plus secondary energy (if there's surplus of energy). In the case of Santa Clara, due the rationing, they want to deliver the volume they get from the MRE, which can be lower than 28MW (assured energy) or even the minimum of 20MW that we proposed. Let me know if you have any doubt. Tks.

"Dear Stacey, First of all, I need thank you for good common you have given to me. I believe that is an main reason why I still can work for Enron. As today's Netco list. I am not in that list. I have talked to Steve Nat. He told me I am last person he took out from the list. He is going to try to add me to the list. He told me there is still possible to add one or two persons to the list. After reading the list. I found there are 25 Gas people in Netco list and only 24 Power people in Netco list. I believe there still is possibility to ask for one more position for power people. There are many types Excel reports for your groups. I believe your group definitely need high level Excel VBA to support and develop those reports. Some people in Netco power list do know Excel, even Visual Basic, but Excel+Visual Basic is far away from high level Excel VBA and there is no Excel VBA for Netco Power list. I was a Access VBA before I joined Enron, but at very beginning I had a lot of trouble for Excel VBA. Mr. Zhiyong Wei once worked on Excel VBA (I took his Excel VBA responsibility after I joined Enron) he knows that position very well. Also his (gas) Excel term has 3 persons. Two are with Sr. title and one Spec. If Excel VBA is not necessary for our system he definitely doesn't want three high level persons. This summer Mr. Wei told Sanjay at front of whole my group that ""Min is busiest person in your group"".

"The last thing was in ref to that email Tim sent back to you. I just spoke with Diana Scholtes regarding the updating. She has spent 2 hours working on the 6th and has run into numerous problems. There are some counterparties which have terminated with us that are still scheduled. She has talked to Will regarding this and he said it may be Monday before that can be corrected.
