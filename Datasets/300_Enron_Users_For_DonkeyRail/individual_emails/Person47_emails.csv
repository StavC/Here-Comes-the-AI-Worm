"I need to ask a quick question. I was trying to get Pam to get Hope to confirm Nov. 5th as my start date so that there wouldn't be any surprises. Pam said that Hope gave her the OK to call Bill to discuss my transition date but he wasn't there so she had to leave him a message. I'm not sure if that was yesterday or day before but they are speaking a little more openly about me leaving now and she mentioned that he hadn't returned her call. I think they know that 3 weeks is a bit much so I think the call that she made to Bill is more less to make sure that he doesn't need me any earlier. What do you think?

"Positive Living Tip of the Day Monday January 29, 2001 Your Environment Do you live or work in an environment that creates undue stress in your life? If so, realize your environment plays an important role in your life. Hostile environments create defensiveness, and an individual's negative behavior can directly affect others who are trying to maintain a healthy attitude. For example, if you are working with a supervisor who constantly berates those under him/her in front of others, this negative behavior affects everyone in the office. And hanging around negative friends and family members can reinforce your own negative traits. (For example, your temper is under control as long as you are not around your older brother.) In addition, negative people can induce others into developing the same negative attitudes and behaviors that they possess. It is true the company you keep is a reflection on you and can influence your behavior. Steer clear of negative environments and begin building a positive life. - CG, Licensed Clinical Professional Counselor",dana.davis@enron.com,"bgacg@flash.net, abraham5@flash.net, kdavis2075@aol.com","'supervisor' : 'person', 'CG' : 'person'",2,EMAZING Positive Living Tip of the Day - Your Environment,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,sent,dana.davis@enron.com

""DON'T QUOTE ME"" Mass mailing to all churches is our area as well as some selected churches outside our area such as Windsor Village, Mount Vernon, St. Agnes, Abundant Life, Good Hope, Lakewood and Memorial. Target date: Nov. 15th and Dec. 1 cut off Curtis spoke to Shaun McLemore yesterday?. He said something about having nice and lengthy conversation with him regarding some CD.

"I'm sorry if you misunderstood me, but what I was trying to convey was that Rev. Jacque ask that we communicate with our assigned organized group by-way of calling three way every Tuesday night if possible and to lift up the concerns that was given to us in the hand-outs and also anything else that God lays on our heart. The time that you have set aside for fasting sounds great. Rev. Jacque mentioned in the last meeting that we would discuss a time for all so that we could be on one accord. I think what Rev Jacque wants most for all of us is to start communicating and being on one accord even when we're not assembled together on Monday night. I would think that if we're praying on Tuesday's and fasting on Wednesday's, there will be some definite strongholds torn down. What do you think? ---------------------- Forwarded by Edith L.
