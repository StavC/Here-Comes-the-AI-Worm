"Shelley, Since Steve and Kevin are out, I'll wade in here. The TW Red Rock expansion is for 150,000 Dth/d. It is a mainline expansion, allowing Transwestern to flow west from receipt points East of Thoreau to the California border. As you recall, we held an open season in November for an [undefined] expansion to the system. Customers were encouraged to define volumes/price/path in their expressions of interest. As you'd expect, we received wide-ranging expressions of interest for various locations/term lengths/paths/pricing. After months of work to define the most economical project for TW, we were able just this week to go back to the original open season respondents and define the project for them. We've given them until March 2 to provide us with a binding bid for capacity in the expansion. We'll look at those bids once they're received and sort/allocate them [in the event volumes bid exceed 150,000] according to our tariff. We've identified what receipt and delivery point capacities are available for customers on the expansion. There is no capacity available for deliveries to SoCal Gas at Needles. We expect gas to be delivered to PG&E, Southwest Gas and the two new power plants recently constructed off TW at the Cal. border.

"El Paso Tests Market for Mainline Expansion El Paso Natural Gas apparently got the message when its last open season for 1.2 Bcf/d of firm transportation capacity attracted bids for 14.4 Bcf/d. The pipeline has announced an open season to test market interest in a mainline expansion and to satisfy regulatory concerns that something needs to be done to relieve the apparent capacity constraint at the California border. El Paso has been under significant pressure from regulators and shippers to expand because of enormous demand and skyrocketing prices in California. In a Jan. 3 letter to the pipeline, Daniel M. Adamson, director of FERC's Office of Energy Projects, urged El Paso to consider modifying its Line 2000 project to ""assist the difficult situation"" now facing the California gas market. Specifically, the Commission recommended El Paso amend a pending application in which it seeks to acquire an existing 30-inch diameter, 1,088-mile crude oil pipeline from Plains All American Pipeline L.P., and convert part of it to natural gas transportation service. The line extends from McCamey, TX, to Bakersfield, CA. El Paso plans to convert to gas service a 785-mile segment from McCamey to Ehrenberg, AZ. El Paso proposed the Line 2000 project as a loop line to replace existing compression, and not as a system expansion. El Paso Vice President Al Clark told the commission that market demand for an expansion would have to be evaluated first.

"Kirk, This is really dangerous... having a marketing guy talk to you about engineering matters. However, since we've recently worked with our other power plants to get them up and running, the data is still pretty fresh. If I'm speaking out of school here, my operations and/or engineering buddies will be quick to correct me. At the proposed take-off point to your Big Sandy Project, flowing gas on TW is in the range of 850 - 900 psig. We provide a minimum of 800 psig to the LDC's connected with us at the California border. Therefore, for purposes of your take-away lateral pipeline design, I'd say that 800 psig is probably a pretty good target number. However, I must stress that the 800 psig is a flowing gas number, and would surely be impacted by how the gas is taken. That is to say that TW may provide the 800 psig pressure if and only if all of the downstream operators folllow their schedules for delivery. For example, none of our new power plants can simply ramp-up without giving TW ample notice of start-up and scheduling an appropriate quantity of gas. We can get into more detail regarding the requirements for operating the Big Sandy delivery point and scheduling gas on TW to meet the plant's requirements at a later date. Suffice it to say that a plant the size of the Big Sandy project presents some unique operating challenges to TW. TW has but 1.1 Bcf/d of gas flowing westward. Directly-connected gas turbines can quickly deplete TW's linepack.

"I consulted with Kevin before I took the oars in trying to answer your question, as well as the questions raised in Drew's e-mail. Here's what we found out... Steve's question: What economics would determine if a developer could site a power plant in New Mexico (maybe 3,000MW) and build a line to the grid in California versus us expanding to deliver the gas to a power plant in California? What you're really asking here is ""What are the comparative economics of energy delivered by wire versus energy delivered by pipeline?"" In this analysis, there are a few considerations -- (1) original capital cost to construct facilities, (2) the operating cost of the facilities, including energy loss, and (3) environmental and other permitting considerations. Engineers tell us that, as a rule of thumb, high voltage transmission lines and tower facilities cost approximately $800,000 to $1MM/mile to construct turnkey. This figure is comparable to the $1MM/mile ""rule of thumb"" we use for turnkey construction of mainline diameter (30-36"") high-pressure steel pipeline. In terms of operating costs, for anything over 100 miles in length, there are three (3) basic sources of energy loss in electric transmission: (1) transformation loss, (2) radiation loss (EFM) and (3) heat loss across the conductors. A rule of thumb for electric transmission loss is 3%. This number is comparable to the actual fuel used for compression on Transwestern's pipeline.

"Mark's synopsis pretty well says it all. Once again, the CPUC is in a panic and is attempting to change the rules in the middle of the game. I'm not sure I can make as clear a connection as Mark has between the actions of interstate pipelines, particularly Transwestern, who, basically, are allowed to charge just a tariff rate for upstream transport, and the huge dislocation of basis spread between producing area and California border. Therefore, I don't necessarily see us being sullied by the El Paso issue. I think our biggest PR problem is probably our affiliation with Enron Online. We'll continue to monitor this situation. One thing is clear... fireworks will certainly be forthcoming when the QF's are being paid on a formula weighted predominantly with basin pricing, rather than border prices. Not to be be too esoteric here, but remember, there are a number of factors at play. QF's by contract are obligated to produce electricity when called on. They are paid capacity payments by the utilities for that purpose. It will be interesting to see how many of the QF's tell Edison, PG&E, SDG&E, et al. to go ""fly a kite"" when they know that if they produce a MW of electricity, their commodity payments will put them under water. ---------------------- Forwarded by Jeffery Fawcett/ET&S/Enron on 12/05/2000 09:11 AM --------------------------- mbaldwin@igservice.com on 12/04/20",jeffery.fawcett@enron.com,"steven.harris@enron.com, kevin.hyatt@enron.com","'Mark' : 'person', 'Mark' : 'person', 'Edison' : 'person', 'SDG&E' : 'person', 'Jeffery Fawcett' : 'person', 'mbaldwin@igservice.com' : 'email'",6,"R.99-11-022 - ALJ Cooke's Draft Decision, Ruling, All-Party Notice

"Late breaking good news! Attached find Rich Hall's testimony on behalf of PG&E. It would appear that Mr. Baldwin's extensive lobbying efforts have paid off here. Nowhere do I see a specific reference to Hector Road/Transwestern as another example of the Comprehensive Settlement's failure to deal with the allocation problem at Wheeler Ridge. That being said, I note that the ""generic"" prescription sponsored by PG&E applies in all cases where, ""the combined capacity of the upstream interconnects exceeds the downstream take-away capacity."" Anyone paying close attention, or anyone with an axe to grind here, will be quick to point out that there maybe other examples similar to Wheeler-- can you say, ""Hector Road?"" We'll just have to deal with questions on the application of the generic rule during the hearings. I think it good news that PG&E chose not to spell it out for anyone.

"Mr. Meyers, I certainly understand and, unfortunately, I suspected as much. I'm sure there are quite a few parties with keen interest in this investigation. Because of flight schedules, the Transwestern contingent may not be able to stay until 4:30 p.m., so I'm not sure I could even commit to a presentation at the end of the day. We'd certainly be happy to be squeezed in during the day if another party's presentation was shorter than expected. In any event, I was wondering if I might leave behind a copy of TW's presentation for others to take home? Like I said, its chief purpose is to introduce (or for most folks, reacquaint) Transwestern to the stakeholders in this investigation, and to provide specific information regarding it's capability to deliver gas to California. Would it be possible to at least acknowledge during the day that our handouts are available to the attendees? We could either pass them out or have them on a table at the back. I'll wait to hear your guidance on the best way to do this. As I said before, Transwestern is committed to working with the CPUC to fully develop the record and to cooperatively address any and all issues identified in this investigation. If I can be of any further assistance, please let me know.

"I spoke at length today with Rod Boschee at PG&E. The main focus of our discussion was logistics/planning for the upcoming 4/13/99 meeting between TW and PG&E representatives. Mr. Boschee, as in earlier conversations this week, did not mention the 3/25 sample results. Rather, it was agreed (also mandated by his boss, Bill Mazotti) that the time was ripe for a follow-on meeting to our initial discussion in Topock back in January. I provided verbal notification to Mr. Boschee that Transwestern had retained an outside contractor for purposes of a decontamination process to be accomplished tomorrow at our filter separators. In addition to my verbal notification, I told him that TW would provide PG&E with a letter, just to complete the paper trail. I reinforced the importance of communication between the companies, both formal and informal. A copy of the letter I faxed to Mr. Boschee is attached below. Mr. Boschee will be preparing a draft agenda for the 4/13 meeting for TW to consider. In addition to TW providing an update on all interim as well as long term plans for the lateral, Mr. Boschee noted two important items. First, PG&E would like more information regarding the proposed controlled Selexol flush. Their concern is that the Selexol was colored initially as the culprit in this PCB issue, and now is being considered a part of a revised interim solution.

The Commission's main action, effective with the issuance of the order after the Friday afternoon meeting, removes the requirement that California utilities buy and sell exclusively through the California Power Exchange (Cal-PX) and clears the way for bi-lateral contracts in the forward market.

""It is kind of coincidental in nature that they came at the same time, but we have ongoing activities to connect new supply and create additional opportunities for gas to both be received into Transwestern as well as be delivered out of Transwestern."" Included in the delivery interconnect projects, Transwestern, an Enron unit, recently put 100 MMcf/d into service for new access to markets around Las Vegas with completion of the Southwest Gas interconnect located in the West of Thoreau area. Two other delivery interconnects are expected to be in service during the second quarter of 2001. Transwestern will add a 120 MMcf/d delivery interconnect with Citizens Arizona Gas for deliveries to the Griffith Energy Power Plant and a 90 MMcf/d delivery interconnect to a soon to be completed Calpine plant, both located near Kingman in the West of Thoreau area. On the supply side, Transwestern recently has added an 80 MMcf/d receipt interconnect in the East of Thoreau area with Natural Gas Pipeline Co.

"This project, of all that have been proposed recently, probably has a better chance of success. First, Mission Energy is already a huge player in the IPP/Cogen business in Kern County, and is regarded as fairly skilled at getting permits/authorizations through the system. Their existing facilites on Texaco's leases currently produce over 1,000 MW of power. Secondly, this project would sit smack dab in the middle of the Midway-Sunset field and is easily accessible off the West Side Lateral of Kern/Mojave's system. As such, they are probably a prime candidate for either Phase I or Phase II of Kern River's expansion. Also, realize that Texaco has a substantial amount of field area [associated oil] gas, so, depending on the structure of the Texaco - Mission Energy sales agreement, Mission probably has access to or call on this Texaco production (i.e., they have the perfect physical hedge). Kern would seem to be the ""pipeline of choice"" here... particularly, when you consider the impact of the reduced rates under their proposed expansion. Without the direct connection into Kern County, TW would have a difficult time competing. Also, keep an eye out for El Paso moving forward with commercial plans for the California leg of All American Pipeline.

"Kirk, We've put together a quick estimate of the cost to install the interconnect and measurement facilities off Transwestern. The estimate was based on the original operating conditions of Phase 1 (80 MMcf/d) and Phase 2 (120 MMcf/d) given to us early in discussions with George Briden. The subject facilities will include a 16"" tie-in to both TW 30"" mainlines (a redundancy feature, allowing continued use of one line if the other line is temporarily taken out of service for maintenance or is the subject of some type of failure), mainline valves, turbine meter, gallagher flow conditioner, telemetry, flow control, etc. The order of magnitude (+/-30%) estimated cost is $416,700. Not knowing your design and proposed schematic showing joint operations with El Paso and/or Southern Trails, this estimate does not include a pressure control and/or pressure let down equipment. Consequently, the project will have to control pressure in the lateral system. As you know, it's operationally problematic to design for both pressure and flow control into a common header system accepting deliveries from multiple pipelines operating at different pressures. However, Transwestern will be amenable to working with the project and the other interstate pipelines to optimize the ultimate design of all metering and lateral pipeline facilities. Also, the $416K estimate does not include any build up for income tax. If the project reimburses Transwestern for the cost of Transwestern constructing the interconnect and metering station, Transwestern will recognize a taxable event. Use approx. 30% as an effective corporate tax",jeffery.fawcett@enron.com,igi@nctimes.net,"'Kirk' : 'person', 'George Briden' : 'person'",2,Big Sandy Project,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,sent,jeffery.fawcett@enron.com

"I'm on vacation next week, but would be happy to get together first thing the following week to discuss. Also, in response to a voicemail that I received, wanted to let folks know that the CPUC did not hold gas hearings today. The legislature is, however, holding hearings, taking a ""comprehensive view"" of the industry (i.e., focusing on specific allegations of pipeline capacity ""price gouging""). They held their first hearing today, but it got cut short due to activities underway in the Legislature. I believe that, prior to cutting the hearing short, the Legislature only made it through two panels of customers, who told stories of skyrocketing bills and associated hardship. One panel participant (Anastacio Andrade of Sunrise Mushrooms, I believe) waived an EES bill and described how it tripled between November and December. I have a feeling that the Legislature's actions may be prompting the PUC to appear that it's doing something. I'll report more on the Legislative hearings as they occur.

I spoke with the lovely Ms. Scott and she and I agreed that: (1) we don't want to endure a marathon afternoon (or two) of PG&E preaching the Gospel according to Baja Path, and (2) a more compressed 2-hour, mano-y-mano visit with Mr. Cherry to discuss Enron's and Transwestern's position in the Gas Accord would be much more useful to all parties. Given the fact that TW has another customer meeting next week in Vail, and I've made a tentative commitment to meet with a customer in Flagstaff the following week, the only time I can reasonably fit in a trip to visit PG&E would be to arrive Wed. night, Nov. 1, and meet Thursday a.m., Nov. 2.

"Jeff, Thank you for the referral of the Citizens Kingman, Arizona project to Enron Asset Management Resources (EAMR), the new ETS service company, for further development. We appreciate your willingness to ""stay in the loop"" with the project since you have the relationship with the customer. It is not often that we have the opportunity to take over the operation of a facility before in-service. This is a great opportunity to operate assets that do not have a long and potentially risky environmental history, so we are excited about this opportunity. This bid proposal is envisioned to be a joint effort between Operations and Market Services to: Identify the functions required to perform the requested services Price the delivered services Identify the risks associated with performing the services Mitigate and/or price in adequate compensation for the risks As the project is kicked off, we enter the information gathering stage to determine the configuration of the facility and the service requirements. I have placed a call to Citizens to initiate this effort and will keep you informed of developments. Julia, I am assuming that Donna Scott will be the primary contact for this joint development and that she will coordinate Market Service's efforts, therefore, she is copied on this e-mail. Let me know if you have any changes to this approach.
