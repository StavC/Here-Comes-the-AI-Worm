Another item that may be worth mentioning is that expected declining CTC rates and the eventual drop off of the charge to payback Rate Reduction Bonds will offset potential increases in future transmission and distribution rates. Transmission rates are expected to increase from cost shifting under the ISO TAC proposal. Also transmission investments to alleviate transmission constraints will be partially offset by the avoidance of RMR costs. PG&E will file another distribution rate change for 2002 that may result in a significant adjustment, but distribution rates are expected to level off after that once a PBR has been implemented. ND and PPP are expected to be relatively flat. All this is important to know to understand the risks for products with commitments exceeding 1 year.

"Below is a summary of SCE's Rate Stabilization Plan. In addition, PG&E filed a plan on 11/22. The major components of the plan are: 1. Rate freeze ended 8/21/00. New rates go into place 1/1/01. 2. Rates for wholesale costs would be capped 6.5 cents/kWh for 5 years. This would allow PG&E to amortize its undercollection under the 6.5 cent cap. 3. PG&E proposes that the undercollection is recovered from all customers, including DA. 4. Rate stabilization would apply to all except E-19, E-20 and E-25, who will have an opt-in ability. I also wanted to let everyone know that I will be moving from doing energy issues to broadband issues. Jeff Dasovich and Marcie Milner will be the GA contacts prospectively on energy issues in Ca.

"A PHC was held in San Diego yesterday on the investigation into markets. Wood is the Assigned Commissioner in the Investigation. He's held one quasi-legislative hearing with hand-picked panelist in San Diego. He intends to hold 3 others. Panelist will be invited to participate. I understand that the generators, who are not parties to the proceeding, have been subpoened by the CPUC to provide their generating information, which was supplied on Monday of this week. This is shaping up in a very bad direction. In addition to the ""hand-picked"" panels, only Wood, the ALJ and other Commissioners can ask questions. The record could be developed to support the view point of roll-back to regulation. This also could be used by the legislature next session. I will be getting the ALJ's ruling on the questions the Commission would like to have answered. We have not been contacted to participate in any panel, as of yet. We may need to turn up the heat (PR?) on the process issues in this proceeding. It is shaping up to be a sham investigation.

"In light of the Commerce Committee Hearing and the FERC Hearing on the 11th and 12th, wanted to provide a quick synopsis of the CPUC Hearing in SD. It was the same quasi-legislative format as the previous hearing. Speakers were invited by the Commission and only the ALJ and the Commissioners could cross-examine the witnesses.

Speakers were: ISO: Kellan Fluckiger, COO Anjali Sheffrin, Director of Market Analysis Frank Wolak, Chairman of Market Surveillance Committee Cal PX: David Jermain, former VP, Compliance, Audits & Reg. Affairs Seth Wilson, South Coast Air Quality Management District: Carol Coy, Deputy Executive Director CPUC: Harvey Morris, Principal Attorney SDG&E: Donald Garber ISO's main message was that many factors contribute to the high prices in the wholesale market: 1. Demand growth over past two years at or around 5% (98-99, 99-00) 2. Lack of generation additions in entire west 3. Reduced imports of electricity from NW, due to low hydro and policy to retain water in spring. 4. Natural Gas price increases over 1999, at almost 2x's 1999 levels in August 5. Nox emissions trading at or around $40/pound 6. Increased underscheduling from June-August ISO has concluded that the reduction in the price caps (from $500 to $250) have increased the overall cost of electricity, with the highest total cost/MWh ($180) experienced in August,",mona.petrochko@enron.com,"west.ga@enron.com, james.steffes@enron.com, harry.kingerski@enron.com,

If you remember, SDG&E filed its proposal to implement the program in mid-September. ARM filed reply comments supporting the proposal advanced by SDG&E. The Draft Decision adopts SDG&E's proposal with a few minor changes. Having reviewed the draft decision, in my opinion, the few changes made do not impact ARM's interests and thus do not merit commenting. The changes made by the Draft Decision include: 1.

"The CPUC is very aware that the utilities have gone to the legislature when the UDCs face elimination of some of the advantages that they have in the retail market. We now have a fully-constituted commission (5 members) with two new democratic appointees with close ties to the governor. This may empower the CPUC to take control of issues within their purvue, which ratemaking and the PX credit, clearly are. Some members of the legislature are loathe to get into the CPUC's backyard and ""micro-manage"". That being said, we still face significant risk within the legislature. We have Steve Peace, who thinks a wholesale pass-through is adequate for competition, and Rod Wright, the chair of the Assembly Utilities and Commerce Committee, who sponsored a similar bill last year and who doesn't believe in retail competition either. We have our work cut out for us. Last year we fought essentially the same battle and defeated the utilities at attempts to include similar provisions into law for electricity. We were able to do so because we had a broad coalition of supporters, including the environmental community. Essentially, everyone opposed the utilities' proposals. This year we have a different scenario. SCE is attempting to peel off environmental groups by rolling in extension of the public purpose funding. They are also talking to the large consumers, who may perceive that they are able to get a better deal from the utilities by avoiding the mark-up.

"Enron, as part of our alliance, ARM, has entered into a settlement w/ SDG&E, ORA, DGS and the Golden State Cooperative on Direct Access Service Fees. These are fees that the utility could assess on either DA customers or ESPs providing service to DA customers. This settlement has been filed with the CPUC. IT HAS NOT BEEN ADOPTED YET. I will notify all if, and when, that happens. SDG&E went particularly ""hog-wild"" on the number of fees proposed as well as the level of the fees. By our settlement, I believe, conservatively, we have eliminated about $100 of additional charges per customer per year. We have agreed that no fees will be assessed for services that the utility provides as part of its market facilitation function through 2002. This is in keeping with the fact that the utility is currently recovering those costs through distribution rates as part of a settlement in a separate proceeding (376). Those functions include MSP and MDMA certification, DASR processing, EDI acceptance testing, ESP and EDI agreement processing, credit establishments and on-going credit checks, processing meter change information, providing customer data. POTENTIAL NEW CHARGES: Special Services: Where we ASK the utility to perform functions for us (researching data, providing administrative support, non-standard processing of information (ie. manual vs. EDI)) there will be a charge.

"As you are probably aware, the CPUC voted 5-0 to reject instituting retail rate caps in San Diego and instead adopted SDG&E's proposal to refund over $100 million. The Commission also approved SCE and PG&E's motion to enter into bilateral agreements and schedule those transactions through the PX using the bilateral-option market. These transactions will be confidential and will be disclosed only to the Commission's energy division, for purposes of reasonableness. The Commission did not act upon San Diego's advice letter (#1242) to facilitate customer awareness of competitive alternatives. That advice letter will not be acted upon until the next Commission meeting in September. The Commission has also opened an investigation into the role of the utility as a default provider and will explore how the utility should pass along its costs to the customers. It will also address whether SDG&E should be authorized to participate in bilateral contracts in addition to PX purchases. It also opens the door to consider alternative exchange. This is a fast track investigation, so I will set up a call to discuss early next week. Sandi McCubbin and I were in Sacramento yesterday meeting with several of the key legislative offices. There was also an interested party meeting (AB 1890 Implementation Group). From those meetings, it was apparent that Steve Peace is interested in legislation to institute rate caps in San Diego, re-vamp the governance structure of the ISO and PX boards, having market participants (generators, marketers, utilities) share in some of the pain that San Diego's consumers feel,",mona.petrochko@enron.com,"edward.hamb@enron.com, james.wood@enron.com, greg.cordell@enron.com,

It is an interesting animal. Basically, PG&E has kept most of the credits, therefore has not divested the credits with the generating assets. However, these assets have been acquired for nothing, therefore they have no ""regulatory value"". In other words, their costs are not part of PG&E's rate base and are not being recovered from ratepayers. PG&E has issued RFPs for sales (auction) of the credits in the past. The credits have been sold to Duke (Moss Landing) and to Southern and Calpine for Morro Bay and Oakland facilities. They were price-only bids. The after-tax proceeds went to benefit ratepayers through reducing the over-all CTC. All of these sales necessitated an 851 application (transfer of utility asset), but it appears these transfers went without a hitch. ORA supported the mechanism.

Might want to further clarify that the scope of issues addressing disposition, whether or not the Commission grants an OII, should address environmental review, market power and interim credit. This should go into the Introductory section. 2. Page 6, Data that is of a non-confidential nature should be publically available. Data which is confidential should be available to bidders subject to a confidentiality agreement. PG&E should also consider other means to access such data other than through visiting the data room, ie. electronically. 3. Page 9, CAPPA, in addition to determine whether or not it is appropriate for the utility to retain the contracts, the Commission should require that PG&E value these assets, in accordance w/ the draft decision (should be voted out on Thursday) and in compliance w/ the statute which requires the net valuation of all above and below market assets. 4.

"The question is legitimate. With the potential for exchanges among affiliates being very real, the only possible solution is to either prohibit affiliate participation or make iron-clad the confidentiality/non-disclosure agreement. Of course, once you allow the affiliate to participate, being able to determine if an ""inappropriate"" transfer of information has occurred is almost impossible. The other problem is that Enron has been an advocate of affiliate participation in the sale of assets, as long as the relationship was arms-length and no preferential treatment was provided. As proposed, PG&E states that its affiliate will be treated the same as other bidders. So, I think that leaves us with buttressing the proposed confidentiality language to prevent such exchanges as much as possible. We would also have to assume, for the information to be beneficial to PG&E's affiliate, that it would result in PG&E Gen obtaining the assets. As proposed by PG&E, they would have to be the highest bidder, taking into consideration certain tax benefits associated with the sale to an affiliate (PG&E's proposal, not my assessment). In other words, PG&E claims that the ultimate determination of the winning bidder is price. If the result was that PG&E Gen paid more for these assets than anyone else, it becomes a little more difficult to claim that the auction was unfair. However, I believe that the ultimate determination is price, with a caveat. The caveat is acceptance by PG&E of amendments",mona.petrochko@enron.com,mike.harris@enron.com,"'affiliate' : 'person', 'affiliate' : 'person', 'affiliate' : 'person', 'PG&E' : 'person', 'PG&E Gen' : 'person'",5,Re: hydro auction,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,sent,mona.petrochko@enron.com
"Some thoughts for folks to think about in advance of Friday: 1. Decision is great on defining LRMC-adopt ARM/ORA vs. UDCs 2. Decision identifies specific adjustments to ORA from Utilities, but doesn't identify specific adjustments to ORA from ARM (which Dan has done) and which we can point to in comments. The table that compares all proposals is excellent! (It's in Dan's memo) That is a great cross-reference. 3. Need to determine whether we support an average for the state, or utility-specific. Which will be more defensible? I think utility specific. 4. I have some challenges to the adjustments that Neeper ultimately adopted. 5. The decision requires that the utility procurement function interact with the other utility functions on a comparable basis as ESPs, including access to information. (Good decision language. Don't know how to enforce.) Here is a table summarizing the thought process of the revised alternate decision. ORA-ADJ UDC, is the adjustments to ORA's proposal incorporating criticisms of the UDCs.

"Some thoughts for folks to think about in advance of Friday: 1. Decision is great on defining LRMC-adopt ARM/ORA vs. UDCs 2. Decision identifies specific adjustments to ORA from Utilities, but doesn't identify specific adjustments to ORA from ARM (which Dan has done) and which we can point to in comments. The table that compares all proposals is excellent! (It's in Dan's memo) That is a great cross-reference. 3. Need to determine whether we support an average for the state, or utility-specific. Which will be more defensible? I think utility specific. 4. I have some challenges to the adjustments that Neeper ultimately adopted. 5. The decision requires that the utility procurement function interact with the other utility functions on a comparable basis as ESPs, including access to information. (Good decision language. Don't know how to enforce.) Here is a table summarizing the thought process of the revised alternate decision. ORA-ADJ UDC, is the adjustments to ORA's proposal incorporating criticisms of the UDCs. The next line (ORA-ADJ ACCPT) are those UDC criticisms accepted by Neeper. The last is the machinations to average and incorporate a bump for ARM's participation.

"As you are probably aware, the CPUC voted 5-0 to reject instituting retail rate caps in San Diego and instead adopted SDG&E's proposal to refund over $100 million. The Commission also approved SCE and PG&E's motion to enter into bilateral agreements and schedule those transactions through the PX using the bilateral-option market. These transactions will be confidential and will be disclosed only to the Commission's energy division, for purposes of reasonableness. The Commission did not act upon San Diego's advice letter (#1242) to facilitate customer awareness of competitive alternatives. That advice letter will not be acted upon until the next Commission meeting in September. The Commission has also opened an investigation into the role of the utility as a default provider and will explore how the utility should pass along its costs to the customers. It will also address whether SDG&E should be authorized to participate in bilateral contracts in addition to PX purchases. It also opens the door to consider alternative exchange. This is a fast track investigation, so I will set up a call to discuss early next week. Sandi McCubbin and I were in Sacramento yesterday meeting with several of the key legislative offices. There was also an interested party meeting (AB 1890 Implementation Group). From those meetings, it was apparent that Steve Peace is interested in legislation to institute rate caps in San Diego, re-vamp the governance structure of the ISO and PX boards, having market participants (generators, marketers, utilities) share in some of the pain that San Diego's consumers feel,",mona.petrochko@enron.com,"edward.hamb@enron.com, james.wood@enron.com, greg.cordell@enron.com,

"Mona, Although the option provision with true-up is better than a rate cap but I fear this will lead to more confusion in the market place, a price that may be below market today which will foster the do nothing attitude. I fear that customers given a choice will take the I will pay you later Vs paying you now approach. The administrative issues this creates are also tremendous.

"Thanks Mona, good summary. I would like to discuss making the following proposals to the commission: 1) Require PG&E to submit their evaluation criteria and weighting in advance of the auction. This will help eliminate any subjectivity that favors their affiliate. If the commission is interested in a fair auction with no preference given to pge gen, this request should be hard to argue with. It may also give us information about how they will try to move this process in pge gen's favor. It also gives us a platform to debate the auction process and gain some additional concessions. 2) Propose that any negative tax ramifications for ratepayers and state residents resulting from a sale to the affiliate should be factored out of the affiliate's bid. This will create a more level playing field and maximize the value to ratepayers. We may want to get Arthur Anderson involved in helping with this assessment. 3) Have the bids independently evaluated by one or more third parties selected by consensus of the interested parties. Also, are there any market power issues with the affiliate owning this much generation in the utility service area? How could the affiliate theoretically abuse this generation to benefit the utility or PG&E corp? These issues should also be highlighted in any filing. The outcome of this auction is extremely important to EES. We stand to make considerably more money the higher the sale price. From my perspective, it's a top priority for us to apply whatever resources are needed to ensure a fair auction.

"Mona - we were just sorting through this with PGE Phase 2 and DG, with Roger, Bruno and Jeff. Questions are is it sufficient to take on issues in those cases, or is there something to gain by expanding to SDG&E? (I thought this was a pretty small market) lowering or even eliminating voltage differentials isn't by itself anti-competitive (our VBUs may have just been taking advantage of an irregularity in the previous rate design ) Do their new proposals have legitimate cost-based differentials? (I haven't seen them.) I think we should roll this up with the PGE/DG discussion, figure out our preferred policy position, and then see whether it merits any action. Thanks.

"Mona, Although the option provision with true-up is better than a rate cap but I fear this will lead to more confusion in the market place, a price that may be below market today which will foster the do nothing attitude. I fear that customers given a choice will take the I will pay you later Vs paying you now approach. The administrative issues this creates are also tremendous.

"Mona, Although the option provision with true-up is better than a rate cap but I fear this will lead to more confusion in the market place, a price that may be below market today which will foster the do nothing attitude. I fear that customers given a choice will take the I will pay you later Vs paying you now approach. The administrative issues this creates are also tremendous. I would rather give on the residential option for the commission to extend another year vs agreeing to the opt in provision.

"I agree that we should not be opposing rate caps for small customers and schools, but I think we should be pounding on the fact that market participants have been putting offers in front of sdge and that allowing the market to provide this solution is superior to legislated caps that require the creation of huge deferrals (and more problems in the future).

"I have some questions and coments. WHY DOES ENRON FEEL THE NEED TO FILE SEPARATELY? We can't we file with ARM? WHY DO WE WANT THE DISCUSSION NARROWED TO SDG&E ONLY? I can see pros and cons of each way. I DO NOT SEE HOW WE CAN SUPPORT PRICE CAPS.....If we could not support them on the wholesale side, how can we support them on the retail side? Doesn't it kill the ESP business? Doesn't it eliminate any benefits of dereulation? If we support them, we are givibng in to the unjustified terrorism that is taking place in CA. We don't even now whrer the monry is coming from. What if they expect to get it from us. Hey, can we sue -- we can't if we SUPPORT price caps.
