Maybe in Article 16 we could try to put similar timing and cover provisions as found in Article 14 re GE's warranty obligations.

I am surprised that the people whom I listed did not speak about transactional work. I suspect that part of it is that they tend to remember things we first did together--first impressions are most readily recalled. Therefore, this time I will give some notes to accompany the names, to help you jog their memories about things we worked on together. First, I would like you to talk again to Fergus Pilon at Columbia River PUD. Ask him about the Coastal Corporation transactions. That involved their biggest industrial customer, who announced that they either wanted off the system or wanted a sweetheart deal. I helped the PUD call the customer's bluff, and then we negotiated a mutually beneficial long-term power purchase agreement. That transaction had a regulatory piece to it, in that we had to set out the boundaries on the flexibility available to the industrial customer, before we could negotiate from a position of relative strength. But it was much more of a deal negotiation, in that we put together a power supply arrangement for the customer that was unlike anything either party had ever done, instead of cramming a short term victory through and creating an enemy that would leave the utility as soon as it was possible--",sheila.tweed@enron.com,"karen.jones@enron.com, richard.sanders@enron.com","'Walt Pollock' : 'person', 'Sheila Tweed' : 'person', 'ALarsen120@aol.com' : 'email', 'sheila.tweed@enron.com cc' : 'email', 'Fergus Pilon' : 'person'",5,Additional References,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,sent,sheila.tweed@enron.com

Both also argued that the surcharge will be inadequate to satisfy the financial community.?

"Sheila: Thanks for the article. Water is definately a hot topic in the Chicago area. Our existing facility (Lincoln Energy Center) in Manhattan is in pretty good shape with the GE Dry Low NOx burners. At peak usage times the plant requires a peak water usage of around 125 gallons per minute (gpm) or 120,000 gallons per day based on a 16-hour run schedule. This is probably one of the lowest water consumption levels of any power plant in Illinois. The two other sites (Plano and Pontiac) which we have permitted this year required significant discussion on the water usage issue. In our local zoning discussions/meetings we presented information that the proposed facility would have an estimated maximum water usage of 1000 gpm (this equates to approximately 1,000,000 gallons per day on a 16-hr basis). This was based on an equipment configuration of 10 LM 6000 units, which we felt was a fairly conservative water use estimate. Our Kendall County Special Use Permit for the Plano site has a specific condition on water usage which limits the maximum draw from on-site wells to 1000 gpm based on a 24-hour average. I believe that this translates into a instantaneous maximum of approximately 1350 gpm. This amount was determined by an ENSR study of the amount of water that could be withdrawn from the deep acquifer without impacting the overall levels of the acquifer. The City of Yorkville Annexation Agreement on the Plano site does not impose a maximum water usage quantity.

I would be happy to look at the interconnection agreement with you. Interconnection of generation is a separate process from requesting transmission. It appears that VEPCO has to buy the transmission (or use its network transmission) when the Delivery Point is the plant. Enron will have to purchase transmission on VEPCO if it is selling to third parties off the plant and will have to purchase transmission on other systems if it wants to supply at an alternate delivery point.

"Opps. When you wrote back earlier I thought you were responding to me and not Rose's email, so I made a couple of changes and sent it out to everyone. The Barnas affiliate language required an affiliate to own or operate the plant (not construct), and I was unclear on the time frame when that had to occur. I'll explain what happened and apologize to him if he thinks we re-traded, and can back off of the changes. The insanity continues here.

"Sheila: Ben asked me to check with you on two issues related to ENA's Cash Flow Interest Agreement (CFIA) with OCLP. 1. Does ENA have any rights with regard to preventing Aquila (OCLP's new owner) from materially amending/selling any of OCLP's assets or contracts? (My recollection/interpretation of the CFIA is that ENA must be notified of any transaction involving OCLP assets/contracts greater than $100K, and that if such transaction is determined to be with an affiliate of OCLP then ENA has a ""topping right"" to provide a superior offer.) 2. Does ENA have the right to assign the CFIA? If so, are there any conditions/restrictions on such an assignment? Would ENA be prevented in any way from assigning the CFIA to an affiliate entity and then selling the member interests in such an entity to a third party? (My interpretation of Section 13.4 of the CFIA is that Enron can assign the CFIA to an Enron affiliate without OCLP's consent. The CFIA appears to be silent on the issue of assignment to a non-Enron party.) Please forward me your opinions on these issues/questions with a cc to Ben and Mike.

Credit support. On the issue of credit support for a project company partially owned by Enron, ABB has some concerns even when Enron still holds an equity interest due to some late payment problems they had in the past with an Enron project company. Also, the ABB and GE payment schedules are different, with GE being more front end loaded. For example, GE will have received 45% of the total payments due by the time the first 4 units are ready to ship; by the time the last 6 units are ready to ship, they will have received 95% of the payment. In contrast, we hold 25% of the price of each ABB unit until delivery (15%) and acceptance (10%) of that particular unit. Effective date.
