"Jim, As you might recall, we discussed hiring an Indiana law firm in connection with a coal delivery dispute involving Enron and NIPSCO, an Indiana utility. The case will end up tried in Indiana and is governed by Indiana law. Wayne Gresham, who works for the coal group and happens to have practiced in Indiana, suggested that we use a litigator named Dan Kelley. Dan works at Wayne's former firm, Ice, Miller, Donadio & Ryan. Dan's conflicts check revealed that Ice, Miller represents the Simon Property Group in various contract negotiations involving EES. Apparently, Simon is a long standing client of Ice Miller and has consented to Ice Miller's representation of Enron in the NIPSCO dispute as long as, in the event a dispute arises between Simon and Enron, Enron will consent to the simultaneous adverse representation of Ice Miller or agrees to allow Ice Miller to withdraw from representing Enron to represent Simon. Dan has no personal involvement with Simon and is unaware of any potential dispute between Enron and Simon. So far, Dan seems like a very competent lawyer who has been not only responsive to requests for quick turn around but also has shown a lot of ""coal savvy"" which will be quite helpful to us. To the extent that we don't have any other connections in Indiana and I hope we won't be having any other litigation there, I don't see an immediate problem with the requested waiver.

"Michael Goldstein called this morning to discuss the way forward in light of the Rev. Proc. and its recent amendment. After apologizing for being tardy in returning my calls, he explained that, in his opinion, the tax advice that we received evidences a fundamental misunderstanding of the situation. First, he stated that he has been advised that the Rev. Proc. does not apply retroactively and that although it requires a new PLR to make changes going forward, it will have no impact on activities which occurred prior to its issuance and, therefore, has no impact on whether synfuel created before the Rev. Proc. qualifies for the tax credit. He also noted that, to determine the capacity issue, one needs to look at what could have been produced by the facilities as of the ""in- service"" date. This level of capacity is the benchmark for what can be produced. According to Goldstein, the level of production at Somerset was well below the capacity on the ""in-service"" date and, therefore, their proposed modifications to the facilities would not have increased the capacity in any way inconsistent with the intent of the Rev. Proc. When asked what he believed to be the rated capacity of the facilities on their ""in-service"" date, Michael didn't know. He has agreed to find this number and get back to me. After I explained my understanding of the effect of the Rev.

MPCB disagreed at the time of the testing of Phase I but seemed to have conceded the point eventually and DPC did test before obtaining the Consent to Operate.

"As you might recall, York filed two summonses against Enron and Eric Holzer in two separate lawsuits' connected with the parties' dealings in the paper market.

Specifically, York claims that the only reason it let Holzer out of his non-compete agreement with York is because both Holzer and Enron promised: that they would honor the allegedly established practice in the paper industry preventing competitors from usurping each other's client relationships by selling paper directly to each other's clients, and that York would get new business from Enron. It is York's position that Holzer took confidential and proprietary information from York when he left that company, gave this information to Enron and that Enron and Holzer used this information to wrongfully steal York's customers.

"In September I sent you all a summary of the facts at issue in the above-referenced lawsuit. Since that time, several developments have occurred. First, the trial date was moved from October 11, 2001 to November 13, 2001. We have no reason to believe that we will not go to trial on the 13th. We expect the trial to last from 10 days to 2 weeks. Judge Ira Gammerman will try the case. There is no jury. The second development deals with the proposed summary judgment motions mentioned in my last e-mail. Summary judgments on liability and damages have been filed and the plaintiffs have responded. We have filed replies to their opposition papers. In addition, the plaintiffs filed a cross-motion for summary judgment as to liability. We filed opposition papers to this motion. New York practice differs somewhat from Texas practice to the extent that we have no firm date for a hearing on these motions. Although we are attempting to get a hearing before the trial date, the judge has complete discretion as to whether to hear the parties' motions for summary judgment before the start of trial. The third development relates to the plaintiffs' theory of the case. It seems clear from the papers filed in response to our motions for summary judgment that the plaintiffs are fine-tuning their case to focus on the contracts' size distribution requirement arguing that the type of coal supplied by Enron, whether crushed or not, could never meet the contracts' size distribution requirement.

"I expect that if Mel didn't examine these witnesses in their depositions, that they will certainly be called at trial. Also, their testimony is consistent with Michael Goldstein's comments to me that I didn't understand the implications of the ruling on these facilities. Personally, I think that Platte's testimony that he didn't officially certify the capacity of the machines in 1998 and, therefore, their capacity is unknown, is sort of contrived and made-up sounding in light of the Rev Proc.and the miracle of hindsight. The Sempra representations to the IRS that the proposed changes would significantly increase production probably didn't mean increase it from 105 to 115 tons per hour. Also, Coston is going to have to explain what he meant when he made his representations to the IRS and I don't think he's going to lie under oath (maybe I'm naive). Regardless of the preceding comments, it sounds like we probably need to talk to Tim W. about these issues and also probably need to talk to the K-M folks (through their lawyer) about this before the next round of depos. On a related note, I spoke with Michael Goldstein on Tuesday about several issues. First, I told him that if they were interested, we were interested in sitting down and talking about resolving things going forward.

This is based on the following bits of evidence. 1. A company cannot claim section 29 tax credits in years when it pays no taxes or pays them under the alternative minimum tax (rather than the regular corporate income tax). 2. Section 29 credits cannot be carried forward. A company must use them or lose them. The one exception is in a year when the company is on the alternative minimum tax, the credit turns into a so-called AMT credit and can be carried forward. It must be used in that case in the first year the company comes off the AMT.",gail.brownfeld@enron.com,a..shankman@enron.com,"'Brownfeld, Gail' : 'person', 'george.mcclellan.@enron.com' : 'email', 'Johnson, Christopher P' : 'person', 'Greg Markel' : 'person', '1633 Broadway New York, New York 10019' : 'address', '212 237 2592' : 'phone number', 'gmarkel@brobeck.com' : 'email', 'Martin, Keith' : 'person', 'gmarkel@brobeck.com' : 'email', 'cpjohnson@brobeck.com' : 'email'",10,FW: Sempra tax rate,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,sent,gail.brownfeld@enron.com

"As I think you guys know, the Sempra case is currently set for trial on October 11, 2001. Given this week's events, we believe that the trial date may be pushed back a few weeks; however, the current wisdom is that any delay will be slight. In the event you get any questions from anyone about this case, I attach a short (by my wordy standards) summary of the facts and issues in dispute. In addition to what is mentioned in the attached summary, please note that we have two motions for summary judgment pending. The first is a liability motion arguing that the contract is clear on its face and supports our definition of Delivery Point. If granted, this motion would dispose of all of the plaintiffs' claims, result in a liability judgment in favor of Enron and leave only Enron's damages to be tried. The second motion for summary judgment argues that, because the plaintiffs never made a claim for the tax credits they allege to have lost and cannot prove that they would not have received them, even if Enron was in breach of the parties' agreement, then plaintiffs' damage claim is entirely speculative and must be denied. Finally, despite a good bit of effort on our part, several meetings and a business related settlement offer made to plaintiffs several months ago, the plaintiffs have never responded or made a counter proposal.

"As you might recall from the monthly litigation reports, Enron America del Sur has been involved in an ongoing dispute with Central Piedra Buena (""CPB"") relating to approximately $3.3 million that Enron claims it is owed pursuant to a 1999 natural gas sales agreement. More specifically, pursuant to the sales agreement, Enron was to sell natural gas to CPB. Enron bought this gas from a gas distribution company called Total. The sales agreement and the purchase agreement contained similar provisions and Enron acted primarily as a middleman in the transactions. Beginning in December 1999, after a change in CPB's management, CPB stopped paying Enron for the gas that was supplied. As a basis for non-payment, CPB claimed that Enron had made numerous mistakes in calculating what was due from CPB. CPB also made vague allegations of wrongdoing on Enron's part. The parties (including Total) have been negotiating for months in an effort to resolve their disputes; however, these negotiations have been unsuccessful. We would like approval to initiate an arbitration against CPB for the money they owe us which, in turn, we owe to Total. Although we believe that CPB may have set-off rights for a very small amount of the sums claimed, their failure to make any reasonable offer to resolve this matter has necessitated that we resort to arbitration.

Maharashtra Pollution Control Board DPC received a letter from MPCB asking it to cease generation until a Consent to Operate is obtained. Kraske and his team are dealing with this. We have heard that MPCB is likely to make a further visit to the site today to ""dig up the drains"" and clearly the water pollution issue could arise as part f that visit. The visit is rumoured and may not be fact as yet. Suhas has asked Atul R to start working on a petition re the ceasing of generation issue. My read of this is that the original approval given by MPCB clearly contemplates that DPC is allowed to generate electricity while it is testing without a Consent to Operate; it can do so under its Consent to Establish which was given prior to financial close. MPCB disagreed at the time of the testing of Phase I but seemed to have conceded the point eventually and DPC did test before obtaining the Consent to Operate.

"As I indicated in my earlier phone-mail message, Elektro would like authorization to bring two suits in Rio de Janeiro against ANEEL (the Brazilian regulatory agency) and Furnas (a federal company acting as agent for power sales from Itaipu). These suits would be based on these entities' failure to allow Elektro to pass through certain increases in the cost of electricity to its customers. Despite lengthy negotiations, the parties have been unable to resolve their differences and it appears that a court challenge is the only way forward. As I mentioned (long-windedly) in my phone mail, the first suit would relate to an 8% increase in the price of electricity which Elektro has been prevented, due to the procedural wrangling and subterfuge of ANEEL, from immediately passing on to its customers. By way of background, Elektro must buy in excess of 4% of the electricity produced by Itaipu. ANEEL has authorized Furnas to increase the cost of Itaipu's electricity by approximately 8%. Elektro believes that, pursuant to its concession contract, it should be able to immediately pass this extraordinary increase along to its customers. Instead of allowing this pass-through, ANEEL has required Elektro to wait for the date of its annual rate adjustment to receive the increase. In the meantime, Elektro is required to absorb the 8% increase with no retroactive adjustment available allowing it to recoup the increase. It is my understanding that during the months before the rate increase is authorized, Elektro loses ",gail.brownfeld@enron.com,james.derrick@enron.com,,0,New Lawsuit Against ANEEL and Furnas,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,sent,gail.brownfeld@enron.com

"Yesterday we received a supplement to the plaintiffs' discovery that contained a damage report from the plaintiffs' damage experts. Plaintiffs are claiming $71 million. This number takes into account the amounts allegedly lost from breach through March 2002, the date the plaintiffs claim they will have both machines up and running. More specifically, this number is based on: 1. The alleged actual costs associated with moving, operating and using the machine that was moved back to Somerset. ($12 million for 2001/ $5 million for 1/02-3/02- Total $17million) 2. Lost tax credits ""grossed-up"" for the machine that remained at Pier IX but, according to plaintiffs, was unable to make any synfuel because the plaintiffs purportedly could not get the coal to operate it. ($54 million) By only using the period from breach through March 2002, the plaintiffs have avoided having to make any assumptions about the spread and also have avoided having to take into account any long-term cost-savings that Enron's alleged breach provided which, we argue, they would have to apply to offset their early damages.

"I expect that if Mel didn't examine these witnesses in their depositions, that they will certainly be called at trial. Also, their testimony is consistent with Michael Goldstein's comments to me that I didn't understand the implications of the ruling on these facilities. Personally, I think that Platte's testimony that he didn't officially certify the capacity of the machines in 1998 and, therefore, their capacity is unknown, is sort of contrived and made-up sounding in light of the Rev Proc.and the miracle of hindsight. The Sempra representations to the IRS that the proposed changes would significantly increase production probably didn't mean increase it from 105 to 115 tons per hour. Also, Coston is going to have to explain what he meant when he made his representations to the IRS and I don't think he's going to lie under oath (maybe I'm naive). Regardless of the preceding comments, it sounds like we probably need to talk to Tim W. about these issues and also probably need to talk to the K-M folks (through their lawyer) about this before the next round of depos.

[mailto:CPJohnson@brobeck.com] Sent: Wednesday, September 19, 2001 4:40 PM To: Brownfeld, Gail Subject: Letter to Brownfeld.DOC Gail: Attached is my analysis of Sempra's evidence on liability. I think this is more than what you had in mind, but, once I started laying out particular pieces of evidence, I thought you and I (and probably Richard Sanders and others) would be better served if I analyzed the evidence in some depth. I apologize for its length, but I think you will find it useful. Please note in particular footnote 2. I think I have figured out what Sempra will identify as the ambiguity that requires the denial of our liability motion and the introduction of parol evidence. In short, the contract may not be airtight on our most important liability issue. Finally, I think you should limit the people with whom you share this letter. I tried to be as objective as I could on this, and some of my analysis/critique might not be welcomed by all readers (e.g., Braverman and Golias, and thus, Bruce Americus, too). If you want to distribute this beyond your superiors, I might want to tone down some statements. <<919 Letter to Brownfeld.DOC>> Please give me a call after you've read it.

I think violations of confidentiality on their part should be discussed relating to the ""offers"" them claim to know about. They solicited a key employee of AMPS concomitant with accusing us of violating our fiduciary responsibilities.
