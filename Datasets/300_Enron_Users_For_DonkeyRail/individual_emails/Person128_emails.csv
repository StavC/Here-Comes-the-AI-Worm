When I sent the first e-mail, we were going to own 49% of the trading Newco I understand from the press, we will have no ownership under the UBS deal. Therefore, the policy will continue to protect against Counter-party defaults on those portions of the portfolio that we are retaining. At some point we should advise insurers on the changes in ownership and the status of the portfolio as these would be ""material changes "" to what was originally underwritten. Bill Bradford is wanting someone to assume responsibility for ""administration and reporting"" under the policy. To whom would you want to delegate this responsibility.

"Sanjeev, We have to seriously rethink these sigma factors. Since our system only has a product specific sigma, if we try to calculate a 90 day sigma factor we will see significant results which will not represent reality. For example, if you take the 1 day sigma factor for West Power (18.97) over a 90 day period you will get results that are unreasonable for any short position. If we sell power at $40 and the 90 day sigma factor is $175, you will get unreasonable results. We need to think how we can build this given the limitations in the current EOL system. For test tomorrow, I have recommended we use the existing 1 day sigma factors. Let me know when you want to discuss.

These will both become effective April 2002. Philip Lofts will move to Stamford to take responsibility as Chief Credit Officer, Americas. Philip has worked for UBS for 18 years and since 1998 has been Chief Credit Officer Asia/Pacific, working out of first Tokyo and then Hong Kong. Prior to moving into CRC, Philip managed the Structured Finance business in Tokyo, having joined UBS originally in London. In addition to supporting UBS-W with sound credit decision making in a very challenging period in Asia, and establishing himself as a valuable member of the Regional Management team, Philip led the CRC teams which successfully delivered two key projects to introduce new methodology and technology into CRC.

"Both of these below trades are trades that Credit should have approved. However, our exposure with IP is over $21mm and we don't have a signed ISDA contract. I think the analyst (Darren Vanek) was trying to get the attention of Craig Breslau to make it a priority to get the document finalized. This is an ongoing discussion with Craig and we are seeing little progress. I can't believe this would have an impact on our relationship with the customer. The USX trade should have been approved but Darren was probably swayed by our position on an EIM prepay transaction with US Steel where we are requiring the risk to be pre-syndicated. Darren is a young aggressive analyst which I believe is doing a good job trying to support Fred's team but with more experience will learn where to be more flexible.

Many of these characteristics will be in the contract by definition but a number of these items can tend to be inconsistent across contracts. For maximum funding efficiency, the more homogenous the pool, the better. 1. Clear events of default and prescribed remedies. 2. Clear definition of termination events and process to terminate. 3. Clear liquidated damages provisions upon termination. 4. Firm quantity - take or pay type. We can monetize a requirements contract but will receive a haircut on the value of the deal. 5. Demand charges/index premium contracts easier to monetize. Fixed price contracts require liquid hedging points to lock in the monetizable value. 6. Clear definition of force majeure and permitted duration before contract either continues with LDs or terminates due to frustration. 7. Availability of Business Interruption Insurance to cover losses during a FM event. 8. Regulatory Outs Provisions - Prefer none. 9. Severability clearly defined within the contract. 10. Firm tenor - lenders lack of appetite for a term contract with annual evergreen provisions. If they are not legally obligated, little if any value. 11.

Cc: Wilhite, Jane Subject: FW: Flying Crocodile This counterparty's line of business is the distribution of pornography. I asked Robbi Rossi her thoughts, and legal is OK with the deal because there is no illegality (as long as it does not involve child pornography). Jane has the company's tax returns. It is a 1 year on-net OC-12 from Seattle to San Jose plus local loop with an MRC of 22K per month. This is a transaction which accoriding to our guidelines we would approve with no credit language in the GTCs due to size. There is no income being marked on the deal. I just wanted to be sure all parties are aware of what we are doing (Jim and Paul are aware per below message). Clearly this is not credit risk; however, it seems plausible that there is the potential for this deal to reflect negatively on Enron if it were to become known in the market that we were selling our network capacity to customers in this line of business.

"Bill,as requested, I talked to Michael Tribolet last week and he felt that transactions under 1 year would be ok with PG&E Company . I would like to take the next step with them and assuming we get paper executed for ECC and ENA ( which is pending).... I want to give them TRADE ACCESS TO EOL. Cumulative unsecured exposure would be about $300,000/day. ( estimated ) and I would try to get the payments from them to us made on the 5th business day vs the 25th business day following delivery. Our master will give us rights for reasonable financial assurances but not definative collateral threshold amount, infact we should keep this at zero for both sides until the air clears. All transactions will come through EOL and the products being sold by ENA, ECC will be cash or rest of month, AECO, Sumas, Malin or PG&E Citygate. The bottom line on this is do we want to enter into Gas related cash transactions that increase of exposure on a receivables basis to PG&E. Commercially, I believe they are someone we want to do business with and we can increase deal flow on EOL for some Canadian and U.S. products.
