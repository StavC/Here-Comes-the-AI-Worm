"Thanks for the update, Ryan. I've forwarded the e-mail along, and hopefully you'll continue to get a good response from all the Blazer fans here. I had a chance to catch last night's game - if you could call it that - against the Kings. Now all we have to do is pull a Tonya Harding on Chris Webber and we've got a chance at the championship! I also thought I'd mention that I'm no longer in the same position with Enron. I moved into commodity trading a few months ago, so TECHNICALLY I'm not the point of reference for Blazer matters - Mollie Gustafson is. I've retained the title only because I happen to be the most outspoken fan on the floor; so I love receiving all the latest news. But if you ever have a more urgent matter, or, for example, when it comes time to renew our season tickets, you'll want to call Mollie. She's the woman with the checkbook, so to speak.

"Here's the latest - The Short Term West Services desk bought power from Sierra Pacific Holding Co. for 4/29 and 4/30. Then, Bob Ellery, our contact there, called the Real Time desk and said they had lost a unit and needed to buy some of the power back from us. The deals are in our system as follows: 594854 EPMI buys Sierra Pac. NP-15 4/29 - 45 mw round-the-clock 4/30 - 40 mw round-the-clock $218 off peak $328 on peak 595714 Short Term West Hourly sells Automated Power Exchange (Sierra's scheduling coordinator) NP-15 4/29 - 19 mw round-the-clock $228 (Total Value = $103,968) Because Sierra's buy-back was in the Real Time market, we sold to their SC, not Sierra itself. Also, confirm letters don't go out on hour-ahead trades, which could be why you're running into some confusion. Let me know if this helps, and I'll continue to look for a deal flowing on 4/30.

"I'm sorry my response has been such a long time coming on this issue, but I've visited with almost every department in our office trying to figure out what happened to this deal. Basically, Idaho got their scheduled cut by the Cal-ISO, which in turn means we have to cut our schedule flowing to Idaho. So Jeremy Morris, one of our California schedulers, cut the first Idaho deal he found and passed the remainder of the schedule to Real Time to fill, which they did in a separate deal. So EPMI and Idaho are in agreement that the schedule got cut, but that we kept them whole by selling the remainder to Idaho in the hour-ahead market. Now the question is, how do we confirm the deal? From your side, is it better if we leave the deal as-is, or restore it to the original 25 mw off peak and kill the real time deal (which wouldn't really be an accurate representation of what happened)?

"Sharen Cason in the Confirms group will be expecting your phone call. Her number is 703-853-3001. I talked to her about the difference in energy types, to satisfy my own curiosity, and she explained that the CAISO modifier acts as a flag to her group that the deal was done in California and therefore should have an NP15, SP15, or ZP26 delivery point. If the energy type is CAISO, they need to include different language in their confirmation letter to the counterparty. While CAISO is still essentially firm energy, it has different stipulations, she said. I didn't go into detail with her, because the bottom line is that none of our real time deals should reach the confirms desk anyway. I'm working with IT in Houston and here to have West Hourly deals default to ""no confirm,"" but until that gets done your best defense from the constant, nagging onslaught of petty deal entry error messages is to have your group check and double-check that they've marked their deals ""NO"" under the Confirmation heading.

"Hi Rhonda - I was told you're the person to contact regarding changes in the Enpower counterparty list. Several items are outdated or have gone through many different versions, and it's made somewhat of a confusing situation for the traders and others who do deal entry. My sensitivity to this is heightened because I'm new to the Deal Control position here at the Portland West Desk, and I'm still getting used to which names we use and which we don't. Monica Lande suggested I ask you about it, although she pointed out that if we've ever booked a deal under any of these counterparty names, then they need to stay in the system. I'm wondering if there is any way to weed out some of those extra selections. For example, Duke and El Paso both have five different names in the system; Arizona Public Service Company has become Pinnacle; and other names were just tests that are no longer used. Please let me know whenever you have a free moment - this is certainly not an urgent request, and I completely understand if the list needs to stay as is. Just checking.

Basically, Idaho got their scheduled cut by the Cal-ISO, which in turn means we have to cut our schedule flowing to Idaho. So Jeremy Morris, one of our California schedulers, cut the first Idaho deal he found and passed the remainder of the schedule to Real Time to fill, which they did in a separate deal. So EPMI and Idaho are in agreement that the schedule got cut, but that we kept them whole by selling the remainder to Idaho in the hour-ahead market. Now the question is, how do we confirm the deal? From your side, is it better if we leave the deal as-is, or restore it to the original 25 mw off peak and kill the real time deal (which wouldn't really be an accurate representation of what happened)?

Conceivably, this spreadsheet would link to a web page that we (or I) could maintain, which would include a WSCC map with hot buttons in or near the areas we trade that would give traders the most recent weather information. I talked to Cara about setting up an intranet site, as she had previously mentioned wanting us to do that, and she said she was working on setting something up with Fundamentals and Volume Management. That's a whole different subject - maybe we could chat about that briefly if you get a free moment.

"Kate, I am glad you like ""Hidden Order,"" I think it is one of the few non sedating economics books out there. The reason I like this book is because, more than any other, it tries to show you how economists think -- done mostly through stories. As I am sure you've notice, this is not a textbook. Introductory economics textbooks are usually structured as if every student were going on to acquire a Ph.D. in the subject. In this course more emphasis is on building up your intuition rather than in more technical aspects of economic theory. I hope you will find it enjoyable. Being an assistant commodity trader I sure you have more practical experience with economics than any of the other students ( and me). It sounds like you are doing well and I cannot think of anything that you might be missing.

"Hi Kate, I spoke to Will Smith, and he told me that the best way to approach testing these reports, is to compare the old version of the report with the new version of the report using the prod database. Please ensure that the data is the same, such as seeing that the two versions list the same deals, and show the same volumes. However, please keep in mind that you may see extra columns in the stage version because of the new fields we implemented: External Exchange ID and External Exchange Code. You already have the icon for Enpower prod, (what you normally use) but in order to test the stage version of the report against the prod database, you need to create a shortcut. Below are the directions on how to create a shortcut: C:\\Enpower\Stage\AggSchVol your_id your_password pwrprodn_ded 1. Replace AggSchVol with the name of the application that you are testing. (Below is a list of all the reports that need to be tested) 2. Replace your_id and your_password with your own username and password on the above line. 3.

Paste line on Command line. 7. Click Next. 8. Click Finish. 9. You should now have an AggSchVol.exe (or other application) icon from which you can get into that application.
