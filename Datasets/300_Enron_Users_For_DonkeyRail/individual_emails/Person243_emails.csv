In particular, we expect FERC to: 1) Extend floating power price caps to all hours; and, 2. Extend floating caps to other western states. 3.

AES was the weakest performer, falling 9.5%. 2. 4 Items to Focus On In our view, there were four items worth focusing on from last week: 1.) AES fell 10% owing to Latin American concerns. We see downside to our 2001 estimate; 2.) The FERC settlement conference adjourned on July 9. On July 12, the presiding ALJ issued a recommendation favorable to generators; 3.) On July 12, the US bankruptcy court approved Calpine's settlement with PG&E; and, 4.) On July 10, NRG Energy announced it would acquire a 2,255 MW portfolio from Indeck. 3. Latin America Pressuring AES Earnings The likelihood of downside to our 2001 EPS estimate for AES. Corp. of $1.89 has increased materially.

"Challenge Appetite for credit capacity is much greater than what is justifiable given credit quality of industry and liquidity of transactions. General Themes Dearth of liquidity in market (bearing in mind that EIM's purpose is to stimulate liquidity) Poor credit quality Highly structured nature of steel transactions (inventory management, illiquid options, etc.) M-T-M Accounting and incentives related to achieving earnings targets Size, tenor and rating drive credit exposure; size and tenor drive transaction value -- therefore ratings drive credit limits. Producers are naturally long; end-users are naturally short; Enron is neither and explicitly takes credit/market risk on both sides of a transaction Short-term Solutions Consider expanding ""risk pool"" (with concentration limits) to provide more flexibility to commercial teams (Pitfall: could be rapidly depleted to achieve short-term budget targets) Reduce size of transactions and increase volume to achieve greater diversity and less concentration Prioritize counter-parties to give consideration to those of greater strategic importance Clarify/[expand?] purpose of E-DASH Action Items Plan more formal education for Steel Group centered around: M-T-M Accounting Basic Credit Analysis and drivers of credit exposure Market Risk Analysis Determination of Credit Lines Calculating Credit Reserves Link Budget Process to Credit and Market Risk capacity allocations More clearly define view of liquidity with regard to different types of transactions/commodities Explore risk syndication options Compare credit evaluation results across business units to ensure conformity throughout Enron--study should take into consideration credit rating, size",chip.schneider@enron.com,"rick.buy@enron.com, david.gorte@enron.com, tanya.rohauer@enron.com,

Summary: 1. On September 27, 2001, RRI announced it would acquire Orion Power for $26.80 in an all-cash transaction. ? 2. In our view this deal has very positive implications for the sector. The purchase price is essentially in-line with our estimate of the private market value of ORN's asset portfolio ($26.83). Overall, the deal gives us addition confidence in our valuation framework and reinforces our view that valuations in the sector are extremely attractive. ? 3. RRI is leaving unchanged its 2002 EPS guidance of $2.05-$2.15. In doing so, RRI noted that the earnings contribution from this deal (+$0.30) will offset the negative impact of sluggish conditions in the Western power markets. ? 4. Our 2001 and 2002 EPS estimates remain unchanged at $1.62 and $1.95. Our 2002 estimate continues to be below company guidance, giving us comfort in our forecast. ? 5. Importantly, for 2002 RRI's Western generation assets are currently less than 50% hedged, which is well below the company's peers including CPN (Strong Buy, $19.75) and MIR (Buy, $19.60).

"The Approval Amount for the Inga DASH has been revised from $98 million to $105.25 million to accomodate the potential requirement of having to replace existing credit support facilities provided by the seller, A.

Although not explicit, this requirment may arise as A.Ahlstrom/ADC attempt to obtain ""change-in-ownership"" consents from partners, lenders and lessors to complete Enron's acquisition of ADC. As we believe that the liklihood of this requirement occuring is greatest with regard to 1) and 2) below, the DASH reflects the aggregate of these amounts. The requirement with regard to 3) below lies with an ADC subsidiary and should not ""reasonably"" merit replacement by Enron. This change was reflected in the DASH mailed to the Finance Committee of the BoD on 12/05/00. The potential credit support facilities are detailed as follows: 1) Panther Creek -- A. Ahlstrom Comfort Letter: A. Ahlstrom provided a ""comfort letter"" for the benefit of the lenders at the Panther Creek project. Upon acquisition by Enron, the beneficiaries of this comfort letter may require that it be replaced by an ENE guaranty. The comfort letter requires A. Ahlstrom to provide up to $1.5 MM in additional equity to the project in the event that the project cannot meet its debt service.

The only construction in progress I am aware of is Indian Mesa I & II (Enron Wind Projects)--I will follow-up with you tomorrow on this. We have a Services Agreement with the Fronterra project. I believe AEP is the owner. Enron has no equity ownership, only management responsibility--Tom May is the commercial contact. I cannot think of anything else, but I will talk with a few others tomorrow. I would encourage you to also check with Dave Forster, head of origination for the central U.S. Hope this helps.

"Chip, I wanted to follow up regarding the issues that were raised by the cash committee relative to LRCI and our request for approx $300k to pay Dow under our lease on storage caverns #13/#14. David Zdunkewicz, an A&K bankruptcy lawyer, was asked to consider whether it might be prudent to have the 4 Enron Partners (LRC, LRCI, LGMC, and LGMI) file voluntary petitions in bankruptcy. The reason to do this would be primarily driven by the flexibility that it would afford the cash committee to fund some of the Enron Partner's liabilities. It was thought that such a bankruptcy might also have the effect of invalidating the consent right that Texaco currently has on sales of the partnership interests pursuant to the Partnership Agreement. David indicated, from his firm's preliminary review, that the potential negatives outweigh the possible advantages for the following reasons: 1) Filing for bankruptcy may result in a claim by Texaco that the partnership agreement is an executory contract and that Texaco could reject any attempt by the Enron Partners to assume the contract. This would result in a deemed default by the Enron Partners under the Partnership Agreement notwithstanding the absence of any specific default language for a partner's bankruptcy; and 2) The rights of Texaco to consent to any transfer of the Enron Partner's partnership interest would not, as previously thought, be invalidated by any bankruptcy.

City Light officials say the cost of buying power for local residents and businesses eclipsed the previous records - $84 million set in February and nearly $80 million in January. To put that in perspective: In 1999, before the current power crisis, the utility's total power bill for the entire year was $90 million. ""We're spending that every month now. The dollars that are involved are staggering,"" said Paula Green, deputy superintendent of City Light. It's a cash hemorrhage brought on by Washington's drought, which means less water in the reservoirs at city-owned dams. That increases Seattle's need to purchase electricity on a market where prices have zoomed to unprecedented levels. Adding to the frustration for Seattle city officials is the fact that most of that money is flowing to out-of-state utilities and power brokers who are profiting enormously from the energy crunch.
