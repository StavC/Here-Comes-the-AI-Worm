"I've been working to resolve issues between PNL and curve shift history. Here is the status. ? The value-at-risk engine pulls curve shift from the source databases. Specifically for power, using the DPR application (ad hoc table), curve shift for Jan 10th comes in at $246K, not the $415MM. Because data isn't stored longer than one week, efforts are centered on restoring required info. ? IT is ""scrubbing"" code and source tables to ensure proper curve shift is being used. o Coordination between both gas (ERMS) and power (Enpower) teams are critical. $415MM curve shift day appears to be composed of both gas and power. (Although we are focused on Jan 9, 10th, issue is relevant throughout calendar year term) ? As of this moment, the current curve shift data validates the VAR engine, yet appears to a have couple of incorrect days.

"Activity on desks is dramatically scaled back. Most of the time traders are focused on setting curves. Mid office has the most work, booking cancellations out of commercial book into bankruptcy book. Currently it still appears as if the commercial book has more deals in it that the bankruptcy book. Creditors with deals showing significant market-to-market gains in their favor a reluctant to book out of trades and question valuations, suggesting that going to settlement might be preferred. Legal is deciding difference between ""executable"" contracts (able to negate deal) and ""forward"" contracts (collapse deal), with one interpretation being beneficial for EES and the other being beneficial for wholesale. South America appears to have similar issues with Duke requesting collateral before willing to book out of transaction, suggesting high likelihood of physical settlement.

"Interesting observation...but I'm not sure I agree. I think consensus opinion is that anything under 2.7 TCF is very dangerous entering the winter. A month ago, analysts were predicting we would end the injection season with around 2.6 - 2.7 in the ground. With the most recent AGA, those projections seem to be closer to 2.7. With supply of gas very inelastic to price in the short and medium term, you must look at the demand side of the equation. The market is trying to price out the right amount of demand (mostly through lost industrial load and fuel switching) such that supplies will be stored rather than burned. Each AGA number is another data point as to whether nat gas is high enough to price out enough demand to reach a comfortable level in storage entering the winter. A low AGA number indicates we haven't priced out enough demand and the market must go up. Certainly, the 97 throws a curve in the bull argument, but the number may be a function of very mild weather, a four day holiday weekend, and reporting noise rather than indicative of a structural shift in the supply/demand equilibrium. We'll know a lot more as the next two weeks' numbers come out. If we get two low injections, watch out. Enron North America Corp.

Under the $9 dollar test, not only were the price curves shifted, but volatilites were stressed as well with NYMEX volatility going to 100% and all other vol locations being raised accordingly. Key findings include: $7 dollar stress only raised VaR by 79% $9 dollar stress raised VaR by 134% It is interesting to note that with the seven dollar stress, VaR on the financial desk actually decreased. This would seem to imply that up to the seven dollar strike, the financial desk is long gamma (which overall reduces risk). But between the seven dollar and nine dollar strike, it appears that the desk becomes short gamma, thereby acceralatering the amount of risk and increasing VaR by 74%.

Second, regarding a different approach, the immediate solution was the allocation of an additional $5 million dollars of VaR, thereby temporarily increasing your limit to $45 million.

"Interesting observation...but I'm not sure I agree. I think consensus opinion is that anything under 2.7 TCF is very dangerous entering the winter. A month ago, analysts were predicting we would end the injection season with around 2.6 - 2.7 in the ground. With the most recent AGA, those projections seem to be closer to 2.7. With supply of gas very inelastic to price in the short and medium term, you must look at the demand side of the equation. The market is trying to price out the right amount of demand (mostly through lost industrial load and fuel switching) such that supplies will be stored rather than burned. Each AGA number is another data point as to whether nat gas is high enough to price out enough demand to reach a comfortable level in storage entering the winter. A low AGA number indicates we haven't priced out enough demand and the market must go up. Certainly, the 97 throws a curve in the bull argument, but the number may be a function of very mild weather, a four day holiday weekend, and reporting noise rather than indicative of a structural shift in the supply/demand equilibrium. We'll know a lot more as the next two weeks' numbers come out. If we get two low injections, watch out. Enron North America Corp.

"Frank, In technicality wise, I don't think it is an obstacle and the term correlations among power and NG can be obtained to use hedge purpose. But in simulation point of view, the POWER-NG joint factors may be misleading since the ""blurred"" factors can be generated if the NG cores and power regions have low correlations. However, if the power desk uses NG as a hedge, definitely the concerns on the joint factor loadings in VAR calculation are natural.

"Frank, By not being able to trade C$ denominated products we would not be able to trade most of the physical products including cash, one month, index gas, or be able facilitate long term structures. Having said that, if the time period for not trading these products was only 45 days, they could get past that without any major damage being done. It will take longer to get physical contracts in place in Canada than it will financial. The extra time the Canadian office would have before it traded physical C$ products would allow them to obtain a critical mass of trading counter parties.

"Frank: One of the most likely scenarios for a VAR blowout would be a severe cold front hitting the country in the middle to latter part of the winter. In such a circumstance, cash may separate from prompt futures similar to how Midwest power traded $5000+ on specific days last year while prompt futures were $200. The correlation between prompt and cash is normally very strong, and is indicated by the small VAR associated with a spread position currently. But in the winter that may change. Another thing to keep in mind while developing this scenario is the assymetric risk presented by having a spread position on. Assuming we enter the winter with normal to below normal storage levels, a position of long cash, short prompt futures has a long tail only on the positive p&l side. While such a trade in an efficient market has expected payout of 0, the payout probabilities may look like the following: 20% $ -.05 40% $ -.02 20% $ 0 19% $ .03 1% $ 1 Enron North America Corp.
