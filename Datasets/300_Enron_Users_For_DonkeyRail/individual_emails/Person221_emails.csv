"Mike and Jeff: Yesterday, Harry Kingerski from Government Affairs testified before the Georgia state commission, advocating the use and benefits of weather derivatives. Harry heads up our rates/technical division within Government Affairs - he has excellent technical skills and is very highly regarded by state commissioners nationwide. I wanted to report back to you that Harry received very positive feedback from various groups attending the hearing. He commented to me this morning that the Commissioners were very attentive when he discussed weather products, and basically snoozed through the remainder of the hearing!! He has recommended to Mark's group that we talk directly to the Commissioners (outside of the litigation process) to further educate them on our products. We are also advocating weather products in other state proceedings, as opportunities arise. All of this work is being done internally within Government Affairs, drawing upon various areas of expertise. We will keep plugging away, but wanted you to know that, so far, we are getting good feedback!!

The Administration is very concerned about the issues you have raised. This Administration is committed to the swift and strong enforcement of the trade laws. There are currently more than 150 anti-dumping and countervailing duty actions in effect or under investigation relating to steel products. In addition, the steel industry is currently receiving import relief under Section 201 of the Trade Act of 1974 for line pipe and steel wire rod products. However, despite the measures that are currently in place, we continue to be concerned about the health of the steel industry. I and other senior Administration officials have begun meeting with representatives of the steel industry to determine what additional actions are needed.

"Rick: I wanted to give you an update on what's going on with 201 on steel imports: Late Friday evening, Zoellick sent a letter on behalf of the Bush Administration to the International Trade Commission formally initiating a Section 201 investigation for the steel industry. Most, if not all, products that Enron imports were included in the scope of the investigation. I left messages for Jeff, Tim and Greg Hermans (trading) over the weekend that this is now official (they had previously made an announcement that it would happen, but we didn't know details because the filing had not been made). I am working with Jeff M. and Public Affairs on our statement on 201. It has been through several iterations over the past week. Do you want to review before it's finalized? We do not plan to issue any statements, but we plan to talk from these points when asked about our position (by reporters or govt officials). Jeff wants our approach to be ""moderate"" given where we are with the domestic producers. We are putting together a timeline for the 201 investigation, spelling out important milestones in the process. This will help our commercial team to understand what is coming down the pike (and when). It looks like the investigation will take approx 9-12 months to complete from start to finish.

"Rick: As background to this meeting, I wanted to provide you with my understanding of the CFTC's current regulations: Because EOL is a ""bilateral"" trading platform (one-to-many), the platform is currently exempt from CFTC regulation, with the exception of the CFTC's anti-fraud and anti-manipulation laws. With the passage of the CFMA, energy derivatives are exempt from CFTC regulation, except for certain minimum requirements. While the CFTC can no longer dictate how we structure energy swaps, we can only do business with ""eligible contract (or swap) participants."" Eligible contract/swap participants must meet a net worth test of $1m (for business entities). The same net worth test applies to energy options (the CFMA eliminated the ""physical handling"" requirement, which required participants to be in the physical business before entering into energy option transactions). In my non-legal opinion, the CFTC has jurisdiction over EOL as a bilateral trading platform, and over financial transactions (whether or not they are transacted through EOL, over the phone, etc.). This jurisdiction would be limited as discussed above. Thanks.

As part of our free trade agenda, we are committed to ensuring that American industry and American workers can compete on a level playing field. That is why, today, I am announcing my intent to launch an initiative to respond to the challenges facing the U.S. steel industry. This initiative will be designed to restore market forces to world steel markets and eliminate the practices that harm our steel industry and its workers. The U.S. steel industry has been affected by a 50-year legacy of foreign government intervention in the market and direct financial support of their steel industries.

ICE announced 28 August that its new clearing house, the formerly the London Clearing House of the International Petroleum Exchange, would clear cash-settled U.S. oil swaps for West Texas Intermediate crude and U.S. natural gas swaps at the Henry Hub. Since both of these underlying products trade as futures contracts in the U.S., the derivative product traded on ICE is regulated as well. The fact that the futures trade on another exchange, the New York Mercantile Exchange, is immaterial. The ICE said its London Clearing House has applied to the CFTC for recognition as a Derivatives Clearing Organization (DCO). Section 5b(d) of the Commodities Exchange, Act, as added by the Commodity Futures Modernization Act of 2000 (CFMA), provides that DCOs shall be deemed to be registered under this section to the extent that the DCO clears agreements, contracts, or transactions for a board of trade that has been designated",j..kean@enron.com,lisa.yoho@enron.com,"'[Kean, Steven J.]' : 'person', '[Kean, Steven J.]' : 'person', 'David Givens' : 'person', 'skean@enron.com' : 'email', 'Steve Kean' : 'person'",5,FW: Expert Link Response,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,received,lisa.yoho@enron.com

Subject: FW: Georgia Power Rate Case Mike and Jeff: Yesterday, Harry Kingerski from Government Affairs testified before the Georgia state commission, advocating the use and benefits of weather derivatives. Harry heads up our rates/technical division within Government Affairs - he has excellent technical skills and is very highly regarded by state commissioners nationwide. I wanted to report back to you that Harry received very positive feedback from various groups attending the hearing. He commented to me this morning that the Commissioners were very attentive when he discussed weather products, and basically snoozed through the remainder of the hearing!! He has recommended to Mark's group that we talk directly to the Commissioners (outside of the litigation process) to further educate them on our products. We are also advocating weather products in other state proceedings, as opportunities arise. All of this work is being done internally within Government Affairs, drawing upon various areas of expertise. We will keep plugging away, but wanted you to know that, so far, we are getting good feedback!!
