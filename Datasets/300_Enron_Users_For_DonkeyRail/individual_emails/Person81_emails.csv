"Steve, Jim Steffes called me to inquire as to the information you are interested in, regarding the California refund case, and I passed the following along to him by phone: Status of the refund claim: The CAISO refund claims made in CAISO letters to Congress, and the final claim at the FERC-ordered settlement conference, were approximately $38 MM. The initial claim in the California Refund case before Judge Birchman was very similar, although the most recent CAISO claim is that they owe us $1MM! A review of their claim revealed errors. I asked Charles River Associates to re-run the numbers correcting only the errors and they came up with a $57MM figure. Please note that this number resulted from an internal exercise and is not a claim by the ISO. However, I consider this the maximum exposure from what is known at this time. I expect that CAISO will revise its claim against us around December 7, and I will communicate the new claim as soon as I receive it. Points summarizing the proceeding: The California refund proceeding at FERC, unlike the Pacific Northwest proceeding, contemplates that refunds will be paid and orders the Judge to determine the amount of the refunds. Issues to be decided by the Judge include (1) the amounts of the mitigated market claiming price (2) the amounts owed by each seller and (3) the amount that a seller may offset against its refund obligation. This proceeding has been delayed due to errors and omissions in the California ISO's data.",ray.alvarez@enron.com,j..kean@enron.com,"'Jim Steffes' : 'person', 'Judge Birchman' : 'person'",2,CA Refund Case Information; PRIVILEGED & CONFIDENTIAL,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,sent,ray.alvarez@enron.com

"A conference call was held today with FERC staffers to discuss items of interest or concern to us. Participating for FERC were Bob Pease (enforcement att'y), Stuart Fisher (economist) and Bruce Poole (engineer). Alan Comnes, Dave Perrino and I weighed in for Enron. The laundry list of topics discussed is attached. We expressed the sentiment that the root cause of all these issues and concerns is the current composition (and non-independence) of the ISO board, and suggested that the ISO board situation should be the subject of the upcoming FERC audit of ISO. We went on to discuss the audit further and the fact that there is no established or formal comment process. However, we were invited to file written comments with the Commission on what we thought should be audited, and Alan is taking the lead on this. We will try to get others to sign on to the comments. Some of the discussion items that the staff was highly interested in included: ISO request for a bid from us to prop up the price (staff requested a copy of the transcript). Any unexplained decreases in ATC (staff asked to be advised in real time). Information related to ISO OOM purchases (and whether they were declining). All in all, it was a successful, informal call lasting about 40 minutes. Staff was receptive to and agreed to receive periodic calls from us in the future. This allows them to keep up with what is going on industry, and of course gives us an opportunity to educate and alert them on issues of interest to us.

"NGI's Daily Gas Price Index published : April 25, 2001 FERC Price Probe Eliminated from Barton CA Bill A proposal calling on FERC to conduct a formal investigation into wholesale power rates in western markets has been stripped out of the latest discussion draft of emergency legislation that was released Tuesday by Chairman Joe Barton (R-TX) of the House Energy and Air Quality Subcommittee. Instead of proposing that the Commission undertake a Section 206 probe to determine if prices are ""just and reasonable,"" which could lead eventually to price controls, Barton's latest draft provides a mix of demand-management incentives, environmental waivers, proposals to eliminate or reduce transmission constraints, energy conservation measures and emergency preparedness initiatives to mitigate ballooning wholesale electricity and natural gas prices in ailing markets in California and other western states. The decision to peel out the provision on the FERC price investigation did not come as a major surprise, given the Republicans' unyielding opposition to any federal intervention in wholesale power prices. However, this move could make it all the more difficult to report a bill out of the subcommittee and the full House Energy and Commerce Committee in light of Democratic members' support for price caps and/or cost-based rates. Barton's emergency legislation --- which seeks to provide supply and price relief in the West by this summer --- isn't expected to be formally introduced in the House until later this week.

"I attended a luncheon this afternoon at which the keynote speaker was FERC Chairman Curt Hebert. Although the Chairman began his presentation by expressly stating that he would not comment or answer questions on pending proceedings before the Commission, Hebert had some enlightening comments which relate to the referenced matter: Price caps are almost never the right answer Price Caps will have the effect of prolonging shortages Competitive choices for consumers is the right answer Any solution, however short term, that does not increase supply or reduce demand, is not acceptable Eight out of eleven western Governors oppose price caps, in that they would export California's problems to the West This is the latest intelligence we have been able to gather on the matter.

"May 18, 2001 Page One Feature In an Era of Deregulation, Enron Woos Regulators More Than Ever By BOB DAVIS and REBECCA SMITH Staff Reporters of THE WALL STREET JOURNAL WASHINGTON -- Every energy executive in America would have liked a half-hour with Vice President Dick Cheney as he fashioned the Bush administration's national energy program. Enron Corp. Chairman Kenneth Lay got it. 1 Mr. Lay used the time to set out an eight-point agenda intended, among other things, to head off price controls on wholesale electricity, provide Enron and other energy traders with unfettered access to the nation's electricity-transmission system and remove regulatory obstacles to building new generating plants and power lines. The energy plan President Bush unveiled Thursday reflected many of those same priorities. In an interview last week, the vice president said he also met with other energy executives, but Mr. Lay was the only one he named. Mr. Cheney says he sought Mr. Lay's advice because ""Enron has a different take than most energy companies."" Indeed, Enron Corp. is a modern paradox. It has transformed itself over the past 15 years from a stodgy gas-pipeline operator into the nation's largest trader of gas and electricity and a formidable player in newer markets such as telecommunications services and emissions-reduction credits. Today, it's the quintessential model of a company dedicated to free markets. Yet as much as any company in the U.S., it has cultivated close ties with government.

"Late in the afternoon on Friday May 25, FERC issued an order providing clarification and preliminary guidance on implementation of the mitigation and monitoring plan for the California wholesale electric markets that it adopted on April 26. The order is limited to clarifying four critical issues prior to the Mitigation Plan's May 29 (today) effective date: (1) treatment of generators who did not supply heat and emission rates; (2) calculation of a natural gas proxy price; (3) price mitigation in the ISO's spot markets other than Imbalance Energy; and (4) creditworthiness. The order does not resolve the rehearing requests, nor does it accept or reject the ISO's proposed tariff amendments for filing. These pleadings are still under review and FERC will address them in a separate order. Treatment of Generators Who Did Not Supply Heat and Emission Rates FERC accepts the ISO's proposal for generating units within California (including non-public utility generating units) that have not supplied heat and emission rates in compliance with the April 26 Order: For the generating units that have not provided the requisite data or whose data the ISO believes to be inadequate, the ISO will use data from a viable alternative source (e.g., either current or pre-existing Reliability Must-Run Contracts). If an alternative source of data does not exist and the generating unit continues to refuse to supply the requisite information, the ISO will treat the non-compliant generators as price-takers, i.e., the ISO will assume a $0/MWh bid",ray.alvarez@enron.com,"tom.alonso@enron.com, robert.badeer@enron.com, tim.belden@enron.com,

"I have obtained a copy of a letter from Representative Tauzin and others to FERC Chairman Hebert which appears below. It could provide some indication of the direction FERC will take with the order it plans to issue next Monday. Summarizing, the letter calls for a comprehensive plan for price mitigation and monitoring within the entire WSCC, which plan should: prohibit unnecessary outages and noncompliance with sales agreements; refunds and penalties for charging rates not in compliance with the mitigation plan adopt market mechanisms (rather than imposing rigid price controls) and allow recovery of all verifiable costs promote conservation and demand response Please see details below. June 12, 2001 The Honorable Curt H ?bert, Jr. Chairman Federal Energy Regulatory Commission 888 First Street, NE Washington DC, 20426 Dear Chairman H?bert: Since last summer, the Committee on Energy and Commerce has closely monitored the electricity situation in California. Today, the West continues to suffer from the second worst drought in a century, and California faces the threat of blackouts and potential price spikes again this summer. After extensive review of the energy crisis in the West, including several hearings in Washington and California, we recommend that the Commission take further actions to help mitigate wholesale electricity prices and keep power flowing into California. We recognize the Commission's efforts in recent months to address the electricity crisis in the California and western markets, including measures to investigate and mitigate wholesale electricity prices.

"I called a meeting among Linda Robertson, Gary Fergus, Amanda Smith and RA yesterday evening to compare notes on the status of the captioned matters and determine what activities we would need to undertake going forward. The following matters were discussed: 1. Refund exposure / netting of purchases and sales 2. Receivable from ISO related to business conducted in various trade months 3. Receivable from PX related to business conducted in various trade months 4. Receivable related to the underscheduling penalty 5. Receivable related to the negative CTC 1. Regarding the first matter, Gary reviewed with us the initial numbers on California exposure relating to our sales in the ISO and PX markets, and our purchases in those markets which may potentially be used to offset this exposure. We discussed the need to update this study in view of the new data recently provided by the ISO in the proceeding. Gary will work with Charles River to move forward on this. The new exposure/netting numbers should be available either at the end of this week, or the middle of next week, due to demands on Charles River related to a Monday filing deadline in the Pac NW proceeding. A ""block forward"" issue related to our accounting for sales and purchases, and involving the inclusion of price data related to non-physical, swap transactions, will also be analyzed by Charles River to determine its effect on the numbers that are being generated by the ISO and its impact on our refund exposure. 2.

"The attached preliminary comments were finalized and filed with the Commission this afternoon, in order to provide FERC staffers a concise, effective statement of our position while they drafted the Judge's recommendation. I was able to schedule a meeting with Judge Wagner, at which Dan Watkiss and I stepped the Judge through the comments and hit the following high points: 1. The methodology of the June 19 order does not work and is totally inappropriate for marketers. If price mitigation is inevitable, the Judge should formulate or make allowances for a workable methodology. 2. The Judge should recommend that the end result of any Commission order must be a just and reasonable finding for all periods, both prior to and after October 2. 3. All buyers, including Enron, should be entitled to refunds; not just the State of California and its IOU's. Enron is a net purchaser in these markets. 4. Only the state administered spot markets should be subject to the methodology, not bilateral contracts, OOM sales or sales to the DWR. The details of these points appear in the attached document. The Judge was receptive to most points. He understood the problems that the June 19 methodology presents for marketers and was agreeable to the notion that this should be addressed, perhaps in the context of the hearings that will form part of his recommendation. He agreed that the actual buyers should receive refunds, and it was his understanding that only spot transactions should be subject to the refund methodology. Although he agreed that the refund methodology, once implemented, should y",ray.alvarez@enron.com,"james.steffes@enron.com, jeffrey.hodge@enron.com, robert.williams@enron.com,

"The following report is comprised of what was discussed at the Commission meeting held yesterday and additional intelligence gathered from FERC staffers after the meeting. We are awaiting the final order and will update this report as soon as it issues. Generally, the order is expected to expand the scope of the Commission's April 26 Order, and this report will highlight the differences. Geographical Scope- Mitigation is extended to cover all 11 western states. Term- The term of the order will be extended to cover 2 summers. We expect the order to issue today. If so, the order will take effect at midnight tonight and continue in effect until 9/30/02. Spot Market- Defined as sales of 24 hours or less, transacted on the day of delivery or the day prior to delivery. Must Sell- To prevent physical withholding, the plan will require all sellers to offer all their available power in real time. All California generators, even those not subject to FERC price regulation, will be required to sell into the ISO's real time market. Sellers in the rest of the WSCC are similarly required to sell, except that they are not required to sell into California and can choose their spot market. They will be required to post available power on the Western Systems Power Pool board. Hydroelectric facilities will continue to be exempted. Price Mitigation- Expanded to be in place 24 hours per day, 7 days per week. Applies to all sellers, including marketers and non-public utilities. The plan retains a single market clearing price auction for the spot market, based on marginal cost bids. The proxy price formula is changed in several respects: 1.

"The following report is comprised of what was discussed at the Commission meeting held tonight at approximately 7 PM EST and additional intelligence gathered from FERC staffers after the meeting by Joe Hartsoe: Physical Withholding -- To prevent physical withholding, the plan will require sellers with PGA's to offer all their available power in real time. All California generators, even those not subject to FERC price regulation, will be required to sell into the ISO's real time market as a condition of their use of the ISO's interstate transmission lines. Hydroelectric facilities will be exempted. (24-7 for 1yr) Price Mitigation - The plan will establish a single market clearing price auction for the real time market. During Stage 1, 2 and 3 emergencies in the ISO's real time market, each generator (other than hydro) with a participating generator agreement is required to offer all available power and bid its marginal cost based on the generator's heat curve, emission rates, gas costs and emission costs, plus $2 for O&M. The gas cost will be the average daily cost of gas for all delivery points in California; emissions are to be based on Cammon Fitzgerald(?). The gas cost and emissions will be published the day after, for use on the following day. A single market clearing price is determined in real time for all generators. Highest bid sets the clearing price. Each gas fired generator must file with FERC and the ISO, on a confidential basis, heat and emission rates for each generating unit. The ISO will use these rates to calculate a marginal cost for each generator, ",ray.alvarez@enron.com,"tim.belden@enron.com, mike.swerzbin@enron.com, michael.driscoll@enron.com,

"This is a follow up to my September 19 e-mail. The attached revised trial schedule was issued after the hearing held on Tuesday. It reflects a recognition by the ISO of errors or omissions in its data relating to neutrality adjustments, resolved settlement disputes, penalties and OOM purchases. It postpones the end of the proceeding until March 8, to provide time for correction of these deficiencies prior to undertaking the rest of the schedule. Hearings on the various issues will be bifurcated- the hearing on Issue 1 (mitigated market clearing price) will be held 12/17-21, while the hearing on Issues 2 and 3 (amounts of refunds and offsets thereto) will be held on 2/11-15. This outcome is good because Issues 2 and 3 were not split up, and additional hearing days were incorporated into the schedule. The immediately upcoming events include an ISO sworn statement on Issue 1, due 10/9, and participants' simultaneous responsive testimony on Issue 1, due 11/6. I would expect that the ISO will take approximately 3 weeks to re-run its numbers to correct their neutrality adjustment errors, and this will result in a new (and likely increased) claim against us.

"Dan, I need your help to make sure we get the appropriate evidence of these receivables into the record, so as to offset refunds deemed to be due (if any, after netting purchases and sales). As you will recall, we submitted some documentation of the $40MM receivable to Judge Wagner. I expect that we will have to provide quite a bit (more) detail regarding this and the other receivables. Also, who do you suggest for a witness on this, or will affidavits be sufficient? Need your input on this, since we may have to do additional research and now is the time to do it before the August 13 prehearing conference. Thanks!

"In our litigation meeting last Tuesday, we learned that netting of spot purchases and sales is of paramount importance in limiting our exposure to refunds, under the FERC's July 26 Order, in both the California and Pacific Northwest proceedings. However, in the California proceeding we are also afforded the opportunity in the Order to offset our receivables against any refund that would otherwise have to be paid by us. Also, to the extent that our receivables exceed the refund amount, the Order provides for payment of interest to us in accordance with CFR Section 35.19a. At present, I am aware of the existence of three receivables. As you will recall, I mentioned at Tuesday's meeting that we should be able to treat as a receivable for purposes of offset, the revenues due us from the application of the CAISO underscheduling penalty. I communicated the possibility of offsetting this receivable against any potential refund at this mornings Western Wholesale conference call, and subsequent research conducted by Alan Comnes indicates that the CAISO owes us $30MM, as per the CAISO's own numbers. The CAISO also owes us approximately $40MM due to nonpayment for one to two months of business. These two figures alone, totalling approximately $70MM, exceed the estimate of our potential exposure in the California proceeding. Finally, the negative CTC issue is another receivable due us by IOU's that, under the plain language of the Order, could potentially be used to offset any refund amount.

"I observed today's Commission meeting at 1PM ESTand will report on the discussion had on the order adopted by the Commission in the proceeding Removing Obstacles to Increased Electric Generation and Natural gas Supply in the Western United States (EL01-47): The order is intended to increase supply, enhance delivery and promote conservation in the West. This is a follow up to and an affirmation of FERC's prior order in this proceeding of March 14. In the order, FERC desires to complement state and local efforts, especially with regard to promoting conservation and siting of generation, themes that FERC recognizes are mainly within the purview of the state and local authorities. The order attempts to incentivize the immediate construction/expansion of transmission facilities via an equity return premium based on a fixed in service deadline. The order contemplates an ROE of 11.5% plus a premium of up to 200 basis points calculated on some sort of sliding scale relating to timing of the project. FERC recognizes that this will have little effect this summer, but more likely summer 2002. In this order (and another not discussed directly at the meeting), FERC extends QF waivers and seeks to facilitate interconnection and transmission service for QF's, while stressing that FERC is not attempting to abrogate existing contracts. Commissioner Massey concurs with the order and stresses his preference for the FERC to deal with interconnection issues in a comprehensive manner, rather than on a piecemeal basis.

"Ray, Commissioner Hebert may have been more accurate than he supposed in his ""Freudian slip"". The contingency reserve standard in WSCC is the greater of the largest single contingency or of a quantity equal to the sum of 5% times the load portion served by hydro plus 7% for the load portion served by thermal units. For 1000 MW served half by hydro and half by thermal, the contingency reserve would be 60 MW (500 MW *.05 + 500 MW * .07) for a total of 6%. As a result, Hebert could be right that price mitigation would be in place all the time, although I don't think that was what was intended. Even if you are meeting the WSCC standard pre-contingency in an all thermal system (7% reserve standard), every time a unit trips off line the reserve at that point drops below 7% until more generation comes on line. Did the FERC mean to include this contingency recovery period as ""any time the reserve is below 7%?"" These are among the problems we are proposing to address in our comments to FERC on the order.

"CONFIDENTIAL -- FERC SETTLEMENT DISCUSSIONS I have proposed quite a few changes and additions to the list. I also ask some questions re some of the items listed. I added a section on Retail Reforms -- we cannot settle with the state unless we settle everything -- otherwise we know the outcome to expect. regarding your question on hourly day ahead markets -- I assume you're referring to the energy market that the PX used to run, because the CAISO already has day-ahead markets for congestion and ancillary services. I discussed this proposal with Tim in March because the ISO's filing at FERC for market reforms had the ISO setting up such a market -- essentially putting the former PX inside the ISO (and for all you historians, finally creating the dream of POOLCO for California). Tim asked us to oppose that proposal -- his view at the time was that we didn;t want the ISO running energY markets, because private third parties could do a much better job of that. So, we opposed that in our filings commenting on the ISO's proposal in March. I'll be in the office Wednesday (Oops! Today). Can we discuss this list and where we are headed? Sue Mara Enron Corp.

"Move forward. I still believe that we should argue that the FERC model of these costs is inappropirate and discriminatory - letting only generators include these costs. Jim -----Original Message----- From: Alvarez, Ray Sent: Fri 9/28/2001 2:04 PM To: Steffes, James D. Cc: Shapiro, Richard; Robertson, Linda Subject: CA Refund Proceeding- NOx Issue At my suggestion, and in consultation with Seabron Adamson, one issue we are exploring is how we can deduct our NOx costs from any refund that may be deemed to be due, or make an offer of proof if the Judge doesn't go for it. The generators will be of no help with this, since they have a credit mechanism in the July 25 order that keeps them whole. Marketers do not. Seab advises that NOx will have a very substantial impact on prices, especially before spring 2001 when the rules were loosened by state order. In order to proceed, we will need to get a source of data on NOx prices. I have touched base with Alan Comnes and Mary Schoen on this. If the idea pans out, we would have to retain an expert. I will keep you apprised on the need for an expert. Would also expect that we would want the Marketer Group to kick in before retaining an expert. What are your thoughts on this?

"Ray, Commissioner Hebert may have been more accurate than he supposed in his ""Freudian slip"". The contingency reserve standard in WSCC is the greater of the largest single contingency or of a quantity equal to the sum of 5% times the load portion served by hydro plus 7% for the load portion served by thermal units. For 1000 MW served half by hydro and half by thermal, the contingency reserve would be 60 MW (500 MW *.05 + 500 MW * .07) for a total of 6%. As a result, Hebert could be right that price mitigation would be in place all the time, although I don't think that was what was intended. Even if you are meeting the WSCC standard pre-contingency in an all thermal system (7% reserve standard), every time a unit trips off line the reserve at that point drops below 7% until more generation comes on line. Did the FERC mean to include this contingency recovery period as ""any time the reserve is below 7%?"" These are among the problems we are proposing to address in our comments to FERC on the order.

"CONFIDENTIAL -- FERC SETTLEMENT DISCUSSIONS I have proposed quite a few changes and additions to the list. I also ask some questions re some of the items listed. I added a section on Retail Reforms -- we cannot settle with the state unless we settle everything -- otherwise we know the outcome to expect. regarding your question on hourly day ahead markets -- I assume you're referring to the energy market that the PX used to run, because the CAISO already has day-ahead markets for congestion and ancillary services. I discussed this proposal with Tim in March because the ISO's filing at FERC for market reforms had the ISO setting up such a market -- essentially putting the former PX inside the ISO (and for all you historians, finally creating the dream of POOLCO for California). Tim asked us to oppose that proposal -- his view at the time was that we didn;t want the ISO running energY markets, because private third parties could do a much better job of that. So, we opposed that in our filings commenting on the ISO's proposal in March. I'll be in the office Wednesday (Oops! Today). Can we discuss this list and where we are headed? Sue Mara Enron Corp.

"I left Hartsoe a voicemail on this issue too. I'm not sure we can convince Massey and others not to cap the secondary market for example, but they need to understand the facts before they run off attacking the pipelines: gas utilities in California opposed interstate capacity expansions into the state. gas utilities had just as much opportunity as anyone else to participate in open seasons for capacity. gas utilities fialed to fill storage. gas utilites have failed to build adequate take away capacity at the Cal border I suspect Socal gas is using its interstate capacity and its in state storage to line its own pockets. In short, if FERC wants to get to the bottom of the problem they need to look in California, not outside.

My concern is that there might not only be a backlash affecting our interstate pipelines, but that our gas marketing efforts might be adversely affected. It might well be found that the holders of the firm capacity (i.e. marketers?), and not the pipes themselves, are at ""fault"" for the large basis differentials between the basins and the CA delivery points.

I discussed this proposal with Tim in March because the ISO's filing at FERC for market reforms had the ISO setting up such a market -- essentially putting the former PX inside the ISO (and for all you historians, finally creating the dream of POOLCO for California). Tim asked us to oppose that proposal -- his view at the time was that we didn;t want the ISO running energY markets, because private third parties could do a much better job of that. So, we opposed that in our filings commenting on the ISO's proposal in March. I'll be in the office Wednesday (Oops! Today). Can we discuss this list and where we are headed? Sue Mara Enron Corp.
