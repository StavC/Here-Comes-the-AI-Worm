We are preparing an advocacy piece on US electric reliability and are seeking some data that would give us the dollars that high tech as an industry spends on electricity each year..This would be a sizeable portion of the $220 billion a year US electricity revenue stream. Do you have such a dollar figure or a BKWH figure from which I could impute a value for this? I do know that computers and computer peripherals consume 13 percent of the US power so I am missing the manufacturing spending piece. The Edison Electric Institute says 1 percent of manufacturing revenues is the electriocity cost but I think this is way too low. Should b e perhaps 5 or 6 percent?

"In referring to your e mail to Ken Lay, the reason we see total US gas storage volumes BY month in 2000 decrease by .200 TCF to .400 TCF below the levels by month in 1999 is due to the following reasons: A. STORAGE COSTS Putting gas into storage for a several month period typically costs 50 cents to $1.00 per MCF or more; B. GAS COSTS This cost becomes too high to put gas into storage when average U.S. prices start rising because the need to USE the gas itself, not store it, becomes greater than the need to put it into storage and pay storage costs for future needs. For example at $2.00 plus 50 cents or $1.00 for heat season storage this cost combination is typically economic; but the situation becomes cost prohibitive when demand in the market for gas is so great to USE it that it moves the price to $3.00 or more or as high as $4.60 -- to which one would then also have to add 50 cents or another dollar to store it.

"Hi John and Vince I had an opportunity to review the slide presentation of EP and here is my assessment. Bottom line: Too robust by 2005 on merchant plants being built; up and running baseload and too optimistic about offshore gas volume growth by 2005 as well. WESTERN MARKETS EP forecast is way too high by 2005 by their assuming 1.4 BCFD of new power generation gas demand could be in place in the west in such a short time..This means ..they may be forgetting to consider the tough NIMBY siting hurdles that stalled all but 550 MW of the current 10,000 mw of planned capacity in the West.....EP is assuming not only do 80 percent of these planned plants get built but then they l run baseload...which is very unlikely. Most shall be peaking or intermediate load in the start years which trims that gas use by 50 to 85 percent. WEFA and ENE Corp. thinks the area gas use growth will be more like 3.2/ 2.9 BCFD BY 2010 -- but 80 percent of this gas use happening late -- not early -- in the time period out to 2010. I foresee the EP scenario as unrealistic given NIMBY and enviro siting limitations short term in the West. WEST SO CENTRAL TX/LA EP sees the area at 2.7 bcfd by 2005; way too high compared to WEFA and ENE at -400 mmcfd and +500 mmcfd, respectively BY 2010 and even prematurely high by PIRA's robust standard of 3.5 bcfd by 2010 . EP like PIRA assumes the gas thermal demand stays on even as merchant plants get built;",margaret.carson@enron.com,"john.goodpasture@enron.com, vince.kaminski@enron.com","'John' : 'person', 'Vince' : 'person'",2,Re: Presentation slides,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,sent,margaret.carson@enron.com

"WHY CALIFORNIA SHOULD HAVE LISTENED TO ENRON NOT HERE....NO WAY The root cause of California's high electricity costs today stem from a severe lack of new power plants. Why? Not enough capacity was added since 1996 due to tough siting problems in this ecology prone state. Even Enron gave up in Pittsburg, in North California when it took too long to site a clean 500 MW gas combined cycle plant on an empty site that is right next door to an existing plant! In fact in all the state only 700 MW of new capacity were added since 1996 compared to its growth of 11000 MW since then. This growth ate up all the surplus capacity that existed in 1996. No wonder they are power short. It is a tough dilemma since this state's hi tech businesses and commercial businesses and homeowners have fast growing demand for more and more reliable power. THE 10 PERCENT CUTS BOTH WAYS The CPUC compounded the state's problems when they put their electric deregulation plan in place in 1997-98 by mandating a high 10 percent rate cut to residential and commercial consumers--which Enron loudly protested at the time--. This rate cu, just as Enron predicted discouraged alternative power sellers from selling into California because it was a hard price to beat and it blurred consumers understanding of what is actually happening to their cost of power.

THE 10 PERCENT CUTS BOTH WAYS The CPUC compounded the state's problems when they put their electric deregulation plan in place in 1997-98 by mandating a high 10 percent rate cut to residential and commercial consumers--which Enron loudly protested at the time--. This rate cu, just as Enron predicted discouraged alternative power sellers from selling into California because it was a hard price to beat and it blurred consumers understanding of what is actually happening to their cost of power. It would have worked if PG&E and SoCalEd had cut their costs --as they should have -- by 10 percent to accommodate the rate cuts",margaret.carson@enron.com,"james.steffes@enron.com, john.neslage@enron.com, harry.kingerski@enron.com,

"In referring to your e mail to Ken Lay, the reason we see total US gas storage volumes BY month in 2000 decrease by .200 TCF to .400 TCF below the levels by month in 1999 is due to the following reasons: A. STORAGE COSTS Putting gas into storage for a several month period typically costs 50 cents to $1.00 per MCF or more; B. GAS COSTS This cost becomes too high to put gas into storage when average U.S. prices start rising because the need to USE the gas itself, not store it, becomes greater than the need to put it into storage and pay storage costs for future needs. For example at $2.00 plus 50 cents or $1.00 for heat season storage this cost combination is typically economic; but the situation becomes cost prohibitive when demand in the market for gas is so great to USE it that it moves the price to $3.00 or more or as high as $4.60 -- to which one would then also have to add 50 cents or another dollar to store it.

You will still hit the customers with the spike on the 20 percent uncovered by the contract but at least the 80 percent wuold be better managed against the worst price swings.

The national media, regulators, politicians, industrial groups, and consumer advocates have all raised concerns about what will transpire in terms of prices and availability this winter=01*and what can be done about it. These conditions, however, are a culmination of trends that have been developing in the gas market for five years or more; reversal of these trends is likely to require more than one season or even one year. In this environment, prices in the $4.00 to $5.00 per MMBtu range have become the norm and will be sustained into the winter.

"I talked with Jamie Rosenfeld, the CERA SVP and he said Dan Yergin is very much interested in this type of advocacy and right now is highly sought out by TV and print media on these same issues which are of concern to Enron -- on supply security, managing price volatility and supply turmoil, avoiding regulatory backlash, and promoting just letting the market work . Beyond Dan taking media referrals and an Op Ed -- they suggested several more ideas. 1. November 1-2 is CERA's Houston Conference Roundtable. The day before the Conference Enron could host a special session, a top 100 Leadership Circle, or a special dinner and dinnner /speaker to which key media would be invited. Enron could invite special attendees like PUC, NARUC , Congressional types and other Opiniion Leaders to attend. We would get the shadow benefit of 1500-2000 attendees and media in town for the Roundtable the next day. 2. In concert with the recent release of the CERA Electric Power Trends publication, CERA would quickly prepare a similar short version of a Natural Gas Trends publication (much is on the shelf already) and Enron could purchase bulk copies of each . We could use a custom cover letter from Ken and/or Jeff as the opportunity to inform PUC chairs, key Members of Congress, the two Presidential campaigns' leadership and other Opinion leaders about issues of importance to Enron and its businesses -- this merges nicely with the pro energy choice, pro markets, pro deregulation messages contained in the text and",margaret.carson@enron.com,"steven.kean@enron.com, richard.shapiro@enron.com, mark.palmer@enron.com,

"The CERA executive roundtable meeting summary results are as follows: If you are interested in a complete set of the graphs from the presentations please let me know. ELECTRIC POWER PART ONE PEAK TRENDS It is noteworthy how rapidly volatility can change geographically in the electric markets. Last year the U.S. Midwest/South areas were the peakiest, but it reversed this year with the West being highest at the peaks and in New England -- but only in early May 2000 were hgih peaks apparent there. Demand can vary from half the peak max to the max. Peakers can be on the margin on the upper half of the supply mix in many markets. We need to watch gas prices this winter as they can effect winter peak power prices--not just a summer phenomenon. Where are the most gas plants now on the margin? Ercot, FRCC, Neepool, NYPP, SERC, WSCC A DISCONNECT There is a disconnect in the on-peak forward market price for power in Texas now; with the added 5 GW Texas forward markets do not seem to take this into account yet. (Note: Vince Kaminski) The Texas forward market should be very soft next summer unless we return to 105 degree F temperatures. New England is just one year behind Texas in its overbuild. One main reason for the spikes in Calif is power plants did not get built in Calif due to a lack of a capacity charge ..and this is not a panacea...as Calif also has many enviro/siting hurdles that challenge developers who want to site as well. .

"Cambridge Energy Research sees FERC's order as bold but still insufficient to solve Calif's complex problems in electricity. FERC does show an important change in direction to be more active. Calif. clearly has gone wrong. FERC did not confirm that market power exists though. FERC alone cannot fix the fundamental supply/demand imblance problem at the seat of Calif's power price spikes now. FERC is taking a scattershot approach however to remedies. Its creating more problems for Merchant generators however. Cera sees FERC at the start of a series of changes to effect the Calif. market for some time to come. Cambridge sees FERC's 5 main thrusts: 1. FERC sees Calif. oversight of the ISO Board as ineffective. Too many price caps changes inside one month, too many quick switches in policy. This summer the ISO operators were actually doing the CPUCs job when the ISO was operating to protect the core customers. 2. FERC stripped Calif ISO of price cap setting power..but setting it at $150 mwh for a soft cap has problems too because its too low (discourages new plants) and a hassle for those who want to offer above it..not clear price signals. 3. Its good that now IOUs can buy/sell power outside the PX giving more market options. But FERC won't mandate utilities to hedge, but indeed they need to use more of these types of tools beyond the old spot market addiction. CPUC does not yet know what a good portfolio for power should look like. 4.

"I agree with Mark's points. While we have advocated our merger with PGE (which did not concentrate market power) we have intervened in opposition to most others. Moreover, there is some hope that the German government will take the opportunity to use the proposed utility merger to force greater open access. We will likely encourage that action and may oppose the merger otherwise.

"I agree with Mark's points. While we have advocated our merger with PGE (which did not concentrate market power) we have intervened in opposition to most others. Moreover, there is some hope that the German government will take the opportunity to use the proposed utility merger to force greater open access. We will likely encourage that action and may oppose the merger otherwise. Most mergers in this industry are defensive, not procompetitive, and, in my view, deserve no credit for convergence, innovation, or liberlization. ---------------------- Forwarded by Steven J Kean/HOU/EES on 09/10/99 01:17 PM --------------------------- Mark Schroeder@ECT 09/10/99 05:26 AM To: Margaret Carson/Corp/Enron@Enron cc: Joan Wasylik/LON/ECT@ECT, Danny McCarty/LON/ECT@ECT, Steven J Kean/HOU/EES@EES Subject: Speech to the British Institute of Energy Economists Margaret - apologies for the delay in getting comments to you on your speech.

"I agree with Mark's points. While we have advocated our merger with PGE (which did not concentrate market power) we have intervened in opposition to most others. Moreover, there is some hope that the German government will take the opportunity to use the proposed utility merger to force greater open access. We will likely encourage that action and may oppose the merger otherwise. Most mergers in this industry are defensive, not procompetitive, and, in my view, deserve no credit for convergence, innovation, or liberlization. ---------------------- Forwarded by Steven J Kean/HOU/EES on 09/10/99 01:17 PM --------------------------- Mark Schroeder@ECT 09/10/99 05:26 AM To: Margaret Carson/Corp/Enron@Enron cc: Joan Wasylik/LON/ECT@ECT, Danny McCarty/LON/ECT@ECT, Steven J Kean/HOU/EES@EES Subject: Speech to the British Institute of Energy Economists Margaret - apologies for the delay in getting comments to you on your speech.
