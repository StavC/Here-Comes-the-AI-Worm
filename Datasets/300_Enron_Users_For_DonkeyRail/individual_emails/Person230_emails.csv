This marks a 26 percent increase over the third quarter of last year, which is due to the strong performance of our core wholesale and retail energy businesses and our natural gas pipelines. In addition, we also announced that we are on track for our earnings target of $0.45 for the fourth quarter ($1.80 for 2001) and $2.15 for 2002. We made a commitment to you that we would provide you with timely information about Enron's business strategy and performance, so this email is intended to provide an explanation about our earnings this quarter. Over the past few months, we have met with analysts to discuss Enron's performance. We received considerable feedback from investors and analysts that we needed to expand our financial reporting to include details for more of our business units.

The decision was made to bring the physical trading business to the Houston office and I do not believe that that task has been completed. My feelings are for continuity that all operations involving trading and scheduling of physical gas should move here under your firm control and direction. I also think that some of our counterparties are confused as to who to call concerning these types of deals and that trading decisions are being made in Denver without our knowledge until after the fact. This is something that I have heard from you and Barry that should not be happening. I would still like to go to Denver for the cross-training to occur and we can determine the eventual placement of these operations after things calm down. Jay -----Original Message----- From: Grigsby, Mike Sent: Tuesday, November 27, 2001 2:36 PM To: Reitmeyer, Jay Subject: Denver In light of the current circumstances with the company and the concerns that our counterparties have at this time, I would like to leave the upstream business in Denver. Moving this business would lead to confusion with our customers and to our Denver based employees. Let me know if you have any issues with this. If you would like to go up there for coordination and training, then feel free to travel to Denver.

"Saturday Weather Forecast for New Orleans: Saturday morning: 70% chance of showers and thunderstorms. Some strong to severe with heavy rain possible. Saturday noon: 60-70% chance of thunderstorms. Some strong to severe with heavy rain likely. Saturday late afternoon: Rain chances decreasing, 30% chance of lingering showers. Saturday evening and night: Clearing skies. That is the best I can come up with right now. Front is moving through on Saturday and it is all based on timing. If the front slows down or speeds up, then of course it will greatly change the forecast. My guess is that the front will come through faster than indicated and possibly by mid to late afternoon, rain chances will be nil, but at this point that is kind of risky. Hope this helps.

"Jay, Thanks for getting back to me. I know that you are really busy and may not have time to answer this but, any ideas on Christmas gifts for the girls? Since we are driving to Indiana before going to Tyler and the car will be pretty full, I would like to buy the gifts for the girls now and send them back with Mom and Dad. If clothing is a good option -- what sizes? Also, does Reagan wear any jewelry and if so, does she have a little jewelry box or anything like that. I thought about buying something that could be for a 'big girl' instead of toys. However, I am open to any and all ideas -- I want to get them something they will enjoy. If you don't have time to respond, please forward this to Jennifer. As for my situation, my morning sickness seems to be getting a little better. I still have slight nausea in the morning but haven't lost my breakfast since a week ago Monday. I hope that this means I have turned some sort of corner because it was really hard being sick every other morning and fighting intense nausea every day. Also, in the last week I have really started to pop out -- it looks and feels bizarre. Take care, Lyn",gmack@utep.edu,jay.reitmeyer@enron.com,"'Jay' : 'person', 'Mom and Dad' : 'person', 'Reagan' : 'person', 'Jennifer' : 'person', 'morning sickness' : 'medical condition', 'Lyn' : 'person'",6,RE: Quick note,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,received,jay.reitmeyer@enron.com

Throughput for this period will be reduced to a rate of about 360 MMcf/d with a total daily throughput estimated at 450 MMCf/d. As this will directly effect all gas coming out of the Powder River, please contact your marketer directly as to how much gas they will be able to deliver into WIC on that day.
