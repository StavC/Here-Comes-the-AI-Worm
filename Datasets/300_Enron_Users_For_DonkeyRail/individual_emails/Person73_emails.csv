"Attorney-Client Privileged Communication Not Discoverable Hi Tim Leslie Reeves recently spoke to me about an outstanding receivable we still have relating to PCA. PCA went into bankruptcy in 1998. At the time of PCA's bankruptcy, PCA owed a $5.3 million receivable to EPMI. On EPMI's books, this uncollected receivable amount was offset by an out-of-the money forward position EPMI had with PCA which we were able to take to zero when PCA defaulted (contract provided for one way payments upon the occurrence of an event of default) and some funds from credit. After netting all these amounts, there is still a $600,000 receivable showing up as owed from PCA to EPMI. Based on the current bankruptcy proceedings, it is not likely that EPMI will receive any additional funds from PCA (we have taken a very low key approach in the bankruptcy due to the lack of PCA funds, the extensive amounts owed by PCA to other creditors, the assertions being made by PCA against some of the other creditors, and the legal effect of the one-way payment termination payment that provided us a significant offset to the receivable). Accordingly, unless I hear otherwise from you, I will talk to Leslie and tell her to go ahead and clean up the $600,000 PCA receivable now, and in the unlikely event PCA makes payments to any creditors, we would then give such amounts received from PCA back to you.

"Dear Elizabeth, Attached is the Mid-C Call Option Confirmation you reviewed this morning. Many of the changes you suggested were quite valid - thanks for that! The only modifications that we would prefer not to accept were the ones to ""Delivery Point"" and in the last line of the ""Description of Transaction"". Regarding the former- we would rather not place specific parameters as to how to chose the replacement DP (this goes for all of our counterparties, not just Enron). Which DP will be similar to the original DP in terms of homogeneity and liquidity to us or to Enron is truly subjective, and furthermore we would not want to agree to stricter parameters with Enron than with other counterparties . The reality is that the parties are likely to disagree on the replacement DP when and if this event occurs, and thus the method for resolving this and any other dispute is arbitration under Section 10.2 of the EEI Master. Please let me know if the attached revised draft Confirmation will be acceptable to you.

", Elizabeth: Here is a set of documents which might be useful as a starting point for your situation. The idea in the transaction for which they were tailored was that the California Energy Commission (""CEC"") and three California UDC's would divert payments they were otherwise required to make to a blackballed ESP into the infamous ""Lockbox."" The bank-administrator of the Lockbox was to swear in blood to send money coming into the lockbox to our account first and dribble any leftovers to the blackballed ESP as they saw fit. Also, the mili-second that the funds plunked into the Lockbox a virulent ""Security Interest"" attached itself like a vampire to the juggler vein of these funds and this security interest was for our benefit. Although I am proud to have the name Yoder associated with the Lockbox concept, I must in all modesty confess I have never closed out a real deal using the damn thing. Stewart Rosman, an innovative trader who is well known for his patience with the legal process, and later, John ""Big Sky"" Malowney, tried valiantly to get Legal to implement this sturcture but alas, I cannot yet put it on my resume as a triumph.

"Elizabeth, I decided this weekend that I would like to go to the conference if there is still room. In addition to the educational benefits, BPA may be sending some folks, which would give you and I an additional opportunity to sell them on the EEI in a more relaxed setting (perhaps over dinner?). Do you have a list of conference attendees? Also, as you know, we are trying to get an EEI in place with WAPA. Because of the PG&E bankruptcy, WAPA and its customers cannot count on PG&E deliveries, and are therefore looking to cover perhaps 500 MW. However, there is a bottleneck in the WAPA organization that is preventing implementation of an EEI, and therefore preventing EPMI from getting the business. It would be helpful to know if WAPA is sending anyone. Also, if many customers or potential customers are attending, Stewart Rosman and possibly other traders may be interested in going to develop business. (Stewart expressed his interest.)

"Well, here's the nearly final draft of what was submitted. Evidently, we decided to submit a bid on the original transaction structure, as well as two alternatives. (not what I was lead to believe before.) I spoke with John about adding more disclaimer language to the letter to say that by submitting the bid we aren't agreeing to enter into a transaction or even negotiate for a transaction. Also, I advised him that the confidentiality statements in the letter were not great protection.

Are there any additional changes you would make because of this? I am sure that Sections 2 and 3 are affected somehow. What are your thoughts on the best way to capture this? 2.

"-----Original Message----- From: Samuel Behrends [mailto:SBEHREND@LLGM.COM] Sent: Monday, October 29, 2001 3:16 PM To: Nettelton, Marcus Subject: RE: Draft of Market rate filing Marcus - I'm having this translated into Word and resending. This reflects the market power study done for Sandhills, an Enron affiliate, in March. (While we have filed more recent applications in cases involving Enron, they were for sales of plants to third parties, and therefore studied the 3rd party's market power, not Enron's). We haven't found anything more recent, but you would probably know that better than I. We have found several existing Enron affiliates with market rate authority who did not make any sales in the second quarter of 2001. They might be useful as shells, but I don't know whwther they'd work from an internal corporate perspective. Those shells are North Carolina Power Holding, West Fork, and two others. Maybe you could make sales through them for a few days. At that point, I can call FERC staff and see if we're going to get the new entitiy's authority backdated to today. If we get a good word from staff, we can then start selling from the new entity. If not, the worst tcase is that we sell from North Carolina Power (etc) under their existing authority for 60 days, and then start selling under the new entity's name. >>> ""Nettelton, Marcus"" <Marcus.Nettelton@ENRON.com",marcus.nettelton@enron.com,elizabeth.sager@enron.com,"'Samuel Behrends' : 'person', 'Nettelton, Marcus' : 'person', 'Nettelton, Marcus' : 'person'",3,FW: Draft of Market rate filing,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,received,elizabeth.sager@enron.com
