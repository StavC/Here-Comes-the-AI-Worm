"Below is a copy of the Order lifting the $250/Mwh hard price cap for California ISO/PX. FERC has also posted a notice of a Dec. 15 special mtg. re the investigation into the California market last summer. Various Enron units continue to receive informal data requests from FERC staff regarding current California gas/electric Steve Kean has asked that all inquiries be coordinated through Sarah Novosel in the DC office. Leslie Lawner is preparing Enron's response to the SDG&E emergency petition to put a cap on gas sales. COMMISSION MOVES TO BRING RELIEF TO CALIFORNIA ELECTRICITY MARKETS In response to emergency conditions that exist in the California electricity markets, which have faced supply shortages and snowballing prices, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission today approved a price cap change requested by the California Independent System Operator (ISO). The Commission also took steps to permit qualifying facilities (QFs) to operate at full capacity. The ISO's purchase price cap of $250/Mwh will be lifted. Bids above that amount will be allowed but will not set the clearing price paid to all sellers, as does the current purchase price cap. This should attract more bids and alleviate chronic supply shortages. Those bidding above $250 will be required to report their bids to the Commission on a weekly basis and provide certain cost information. The non-profit ISO and PX began operations in California in 1998. The PX is the scheduling coordinator for the IOUs as well as other market participants.

I'd rather that there were no tolerances in the OBA -- only the concept of reasonable balances. With this point located in the makret area, it is quite possible that we'll be the ones with the swing (especially since we'll have flow control). If you prefer a tolerance in both the termination and tolerance paragraphs I guess that's fine -- since the only remedy in either case is termination of the OBA. The existing balance (even if over 100,000 cum) will be settled up under the OBA. -----Original Message----- From: McCoppin, Dorothy Sent: Tuesday, October 16, 2001 2:22 PM To: Corman, Shelley Subject: FW: Gulfstream OBA-Final Look Importance: High Shelley -- Frazier did not seem to understand my changes in the tolerance sections (4c and 4d). So, to clarify: On the tolerances, my concern was twofold -- that we only have the 100,000 dth limit in the ""termination"" paragraph (and not in the tolerance paragraph), and that it was not clear that, even if the cumulative daily imbalances totaled only 5% of the scheduled volumes for the month, the parties would work to keep it below an actual volume of 100,000 dth (or have a right to terminate the agreement if it were over that amount). --Dot -----Original Message-----",shelley.corman@enron.com,frazier.king@enron.com,"'Corman, Shelley' : 'person', 'McCoppin, Dorothy' : 'person', 'Dot' : 'person', 'Frazier' : 'person', 'McCoppin, Dorothy' : 'person', 'Corman, Shelley' : 'person', 'Shelley' : 'person', 'Frazier' : 'person', 'Dot' : 'person'",9,FW: Gulfstream OBA-Final Look,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,sent,shelley.corman@enron.com
"Late yesterday, Steve Kean assembled a meeting of staff from across business units to discuss the legal and regulatory implications of current events in California. Here are the notes I captured from the meeting. Background: The hard cap is still in place in Calif. electric market at this time (although the FERC has proposed moving to a soft cap under which prices above the cap would be allowed if cost justified). As of yesterday, electricity is still flowing out of the state. The governor has asked people to cut back on their electric usage, including Christmas lights. With rolling brown-outs a possibility, there is a belief that people will go ahead an sell power at high prices above the hard cap, counting on the soft cap (i.e. regulators wanting generator to keep running at high-prices if that is what it takes to keep going). But, this causes an interesting dilemma under which generators which have $5-6 gas are better off selling their gas, as only generators that can show a $27 gas price would be able to charge market electric rates. Parties with $5-6 gas are better off reselling the gas for another use. Delivered gas at Cal. border is $26-27 ($33.75 today) for the remainder of the month, $19 for Jan. base load and $8 summer deliveries. It was reported that SoCal gas has been buying $24 gas to fill up storage this week to get ready for cold weather/increased loads next week. This doesn't completely track with ETS understanding that SoCal was withdrawing gas from storage this week.

"Steve, I am most disheartened to hear that Dale Neuner regards my previous conversation with he and Mark Taylor as the justification for why EOL cannot accomodate GPG pipeline capacity transactions. During the discussion in Mark's office, Dale explained that currently all EOL users can run reports and see all the details of transactions. As currently structured this would mean that any EOL user, including ENA, would be able to run a report to see detail behind bids on pipeline capacity. Obviously this would be a problem under the marketing affiliate rules. We discussed three possible ways to address this: Add security such that ENA/EES users cannot run reports on pipeline bid data. I understood leaving the meeting that this might be technically difficult or expensive. Exclude pipeline data from the reporting feature altogether. Here the story was that while this was not necessarily difficult, EOL could not make any changes before version 2 was ready. The impression was that this would be possible after version 2. Erect procedural firewalls. Mark Taylor suggested that perhaps we could inform all ENA and EES personnel that the company has a policy that prevents them from running reports on GPG data. This probably isn't a good long-run solution, but we all agreed that it might serve as a bridge measure. This approach is supported by the fact that Enron Networks has already entered into a confidentiality agreement with GPG. I left the meeting thinking that one or all of these options was feasible and have not had any correspondence to the contrary since the",shelley.corman@enron.com,steve.hotte@enron.com,"'Steve' : 'person', 'Dale Neuner' : 'person', 'Mark Taylor' : 'person', 'Mark Taylor' : 'person'",4,Re: Northern EOL,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,sent,shelley.corman@enron.com

"Late yesterday, Steve Kean assembled a meeting of staff from across business units to discuss the legal and regulatory implications of current events in California. Here are the notes I captured from the meeting. Background: The hard cap is still in place in Calif. electric market at this time (although the FERC has proposed moving to a soft cap under which prices above the cap would be allowed if cost justified). As of yesterday, electricity is still flowing out of the state. The governor has asked people to cut back on their electric usage, including Christmas lights. With rolling brown-outs a possibility, there is a belief that people will go ahead an sell power at high prices above the hard cap, counting on the soft cap (i.e. regulators wanting generator to keep running at high-prices if that is what it takes to keep going). But, this causes an interesting dilemma under which generators which have $5-6 gas are better off selling their gas, as only generators that can show a $27 gas price would be able to charge market electric rates. Parties with $5-6 gas are better off reselling the gas for another use. Delivered gas at Cal. border is $26-27 ($33.75 today) for the remainder of the month, $19 for Jan. base load and $8 summer deliveries. It was reported that SoCal gas has been buying $24 gas to fill up storage this week to get ready for cold weather/increased loads next week. This doesn't completely track with ETS understanding that SoCal was withdrawing gas from storage this week.

"Enron Gov't Affairs provided this report on the Energy and Natural Resources hearing on Natural Gas markets held this morning. Please note the suggestion that we provide a list of any specific items that we would like to see added to energy policy legislation: Witnesses from the Energy Information Administration, American Gas Association, Natural Gas Supply Association and National Association of State Energy Officials (NASEO) each testified that gas prices are high because demand is greater than supply. Basically, the hearing provided an opportunity for Western State Senators to complain about policies that restrict E&P activity - especially on federal lands. Sen. Murkowski will probably introduce a supply oriented bill in the next Congress. The bottom line is that a number of Senators are deploring the lack of a National Energy Policy and seem intent on doing something to rectify such omission. One specific area of interest of Senator Bingaman seemed to be the need to create incentives to encourage pipleine investment. He seemed especially interested in the need for long term contracts to back development Given that there may be interest to pass Energy Policy legislation, it may be worthwhile to put together a wish list of items that affect our bottom line, such as accelerated depreciation provisions, tax credits, etc.",shelley.corman@enron.com,"stanley.horton@enron.com, danny.mccarty@enron.com, mary.miller@enron.com,

"From this side, Sharon Damron's reaction doesn't fit with what I've heard from other pipes. For instance, Staff called one of the CMS pipes to schedule a tech. conference on Nov. 14, but the pipe couldn't do it that day and offered to schedule it for the 15th -- Staff answered that they would schedule something for January in that case. This story is more in line with what I've heard about the timeline for Staff. Also, in other cases Staff has given scheduling deference to meetings with customers (settlement meetings in Dominion's case, which caused Staff to postpone their 2nd tech. conference by 7 weeks). -Nancy Shelley Corman 11/03/2000 12:50 PM To: Nancy Bagot/OTS/Enron@ENRON cc: Subject: Re: NN 637 FYI ---------------------- Forwarded by Shelley Corman/ET&S/Enron on 11/03/2000 12:49 PM --------------------------- From: Drew Fossum 11/03/2000 10:22 AM To: Drew Fossum/ET&S/Enron@ENRON cc: Mary Kay Miller/ET&S/Enron@ENRON, Glen Hass/ET&S/Enron@ENRON, Dari Dornan/ET&S/Enron@ENRON, Maria Pavlou/ET&S/Enron@ENRON, Shelley Corman/ET&S/Enron@ENRON Subject: Re: NN 637 Another thought on this.

"Chris Jensen, Executive Director of the Florida Energy Pipeline Association, has learned from some DEP agency contacts that the Alliance (operating behind the front organization known as Friends of the Aquifer, Inc.) has decided to drop their lawsuits appealing the denials of their petitions to more severely regulate pipelines in Florida. While this is good news for those of us fighting the war here in Florida, the reason for this withdrawal of their appeals of failed efforts on three different petitions at the state level in Florida is because of their belief that their current activity at the Federal level holds greater promise of success and their desire to concentrate their resources in that effort. My thoughts on this is that the pipeline industry should get organized and execute a ""full court press"" defense which is proactive as we move into increased future efforts at the Federal level by the Alliance through their other front organizations. These organizations have been created to burden pipeline competition to benefit the maritime interests. From my vantage point I am limited to mostly what I see in the press, but these front organization are winning the battle in the national press that I have seen and heard. AOPL and INGAA do not come across in the press as being equipped or prepared to handle the shaping of the pipeline safety issues in the press that these Alliance front organizations have been doing.

"Shelley, I'm glad we made the decision to participate in today's drafting session. There were only nine of us involved, with Ed Ross, Skip Simmons and Craig Chancellor representing the generators, while Byron White, Georgia Carter and myself were there to represent the pipelines. The others were with the Alliance. Ed was his usual self. He was confidently making the good economic case why the pipelines should consider the generator's position and how/why the FERC would likely side with them. Craig tried to frame it commercially, and Skip played peacemaker. Byron and I played a little ""good cop/bad cop"" on behalf of the pipes, with Byron being the bad cop. Anyway, sum and substance, I think we'll be more pleased with the next draft of this document than what was submitted to us recently. The first sentence was replaced with a more sweeping statement of intent and mission of the parties that focused on the provisioning of the service being subject to physical operating considerations. There emerged a realization that maybe two products are being contemplated here: (1) a product that blocks out a period of time for uniform deliveries (say, 8 hours), and (2) a product that basically provides the generator an option on when to take the agreed upon block of capacity. It was agreed that the first product is likely to be less valuable than the second, and priced accordingly. Byron and I argued that segmenting hourly rights should not be mandated, and in fact, may be physically impossible along some locations of the",jeffery.fawcett@enron.com,shelley.corman@enron.com,"'Shelley' : 'person', 'Ed Ross' : 'person', 'Skip Simmons' : 'person', 'Craig Chancellor' : 'person', 'Byron White' : 'person', 'Georgia Carter' : 'person'",6,Principles for Generator Discussion,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,received,shelley.corman@enron.com

"The whole thing also bugs me on an intuitive level, but I'm not sure it is a legal conflict of interest. The Northern cases he is involved in are not really ""GISB matters."" There are certainly issues like the 637 compliance issue that involve GISB standards, however. GISB is a freestanding entitity and his representation does not equate to representation of Enron so he could claim that his only client interest to worry about is GISB itself. As long as he does not take positions in Northern cases that are inconsistent with what GISB wants, he's technically OK. I suspect he'd argue that his work in the Northern docket is completely consistent with GISB's objective of achieving world domination. This was my from the hip analysis when Jay first showed up in our cases, so I may have missed something. For example, I'm not really clear on GISB's structure. Can we argue that it is not a real stand alone entity but rather a ""front"" for a cooperative group of companies that includes Enron? If so, we might have a real conflict. Thanks.

"With regard to the Commission's limitations on the right of first refusal, Order 637 provides for grandfathering of discounted long-term contracts that are now subject to ROFR. The Commission's rationale was that grandfathering gives all shippers notice of the new limitation and the opportunity to re-execute current contracts. The TW Commercial Group has asked whether we should challenge the grandfathering of existing contracts. In limiting the right of first refusal, the Commission has expressly acknowledged that if a customer is truly captive and has no alternatives for service, it is likely that its contract will be at the maximum rate. Shippers that are not captive and have alternatives in the marketplace do not need the protection of ROFR, and the pipeline should be able to negotiate with other interested shippers upon expiration of the contract. In light of these conclusions, there should be no reason to grandfather the ROFR rights of shippers under existing discounted contracts. Such shippers would not be harmed by removal of the right immediately upon the effective date of a pipeline's tariff filing to limit the right of first refusal (assuming the service contract incorporates tariff terms on an ""as amended"" basis). Consistent with the Commission's order, it would not be unfair to make these shippers compete with others for the capacity upon expiration of the contract.",susan.scott@enron.com,shelley.corman@enron.com,"'customer' : 'person', 'shippers' : 'person'",2,Order 637: TW Comment on Rehearing Request,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,received,shelley.corman@enron.com
