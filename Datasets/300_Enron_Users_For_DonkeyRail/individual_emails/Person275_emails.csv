"Jeff Porter at CES said in a 3/16 email... as of 4/1/00, CES' SST capacity on TCO will decrease. We have submitted a request to COH for Storage Capacity and Transport (FSS & SST) for the 00-01 season. COH should have the actual numbers late Friday, but I have made a guesstimate below. You only get 50% of your Oct-Mar WD capacity for Apr-Sep Inj, which could be around 50,000 dth/d. The numbers below are from 3/00, so 4/00 should be smaller, but I will forward to you as soon as I can. Which means we will not have the volumes until 3/17. Is it a problem that it wasn't March 15?

"Scott--My March '00 first-of-the-month numbers for AGL assumed that the total daily firm load across all 9 pools would average 36,774 dth/day. This would be met by a combination of maximizing the daily withdrawals from IBSS as well as the Directly assigned storage supplies with the remainder served by flowing gas. On days when the firm requirement falls below the 36,774 (for March 1, our combined DSR is currently 23,758dth), I don't want to reduce IBSS withdrawals because we need to maximize those thru March in order to have that inventory down to the 35% level by March 31. Otherwise, we could be liable for penalties. Instead, I would prefer to swing on the flowing gas, if necessary and keep drawing the gas out of storage.

"Scott--The volumes delivered into Central Hudson off Iroquois for Arma Textiles was included in Exhibit 1 of the 12/99 Energy Purchase Agreement such that it would appear that Enron would be supplying this gas to CES. However, the gas to supply Arma was already purchased from Duke Energy, and as far as I can tell, Enron has had nothing to do with delivering this gas, and Duke Energy has billed us directly for the gas that they supply each month. I discussed this with Chris Germany, and we agreed that CES would just deal directly with Duke Energy on this and leave Enron out of it. Accordingly, if you look at the May'00 first-of-the-month request that I sent to Enron on April 24, the table does show 135 dth/day into Central Hudson off Iroquois. However, the table notes that this gas is being supplied by Duke Energy and therefore no volumes are being requested from Enron. Please let me know if this needs further action or clarification.

"So you are using the current month's capacity times the cumulative theoretical % to determine the total storage volume to date. In that case, have you credited CES each month for an overcharge of gas for each previous month? If you are doing that and plan to for the next 8 months, let me know and I will adjust my numbers, but that has got to be an accounting nightmare. I propose each month's volume is THAT months storage capacity times the percentage. There is no retro adjustment needed plus it is easier to stay within ratchets. See attached spreadsheet for difference in numbers for EES. ( I am out of town and cannot get into my files, so the capacity numbers are a bit off, but it explains the concept). Simply, can you agree on my numbers from below for the sale to NPC? If you have been adjusting each month and want to keep it that way, OK. You will just have to get the billing straight with Doug. Let me know.
