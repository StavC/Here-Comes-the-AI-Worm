The M&A analysis was just updated as they have been several reservoir transactions in the past few months (AEC @ Manchester, Atmos @ East Diamond, and Aquila @ Lodi). Prior to these transactions we did not have enough data points to draw meaningful conclusions about the trends in reservoir acquisition. I have attached the output for your review but I think a couple of points are key. The reservoir curve is ""hockey-sticking"" just as the salt curve did previously. While not as dramatic as salt, the premiums are increasing dramatically. The market is NOT placing a premium on optionality. Salt is inherently more flexible than a reservoir, yet on a deliverability basis, there does not appear to be a significant difference. That may explain why we see players who DO value optionality in the marketplace (Aquila, AEC, Duke, etc).

Storage : I am having a phone call with Dave Neubauer, V.P. ETS, to discuss Northern's monetization of their gas. In addition, Skadden Arps because of their workload associated with representating El Paso in California has delayed our meeting for another two weeks. I have expressed my extreme displeasure and am seeking other appropriate legal firms who are well versed in regulatory affairs to advise us on the our storage monetization structure. Paul continues to get very positive feedback from clients. We can not move forward without addressing the regulatory risk related to our financing structure. Steffes is aware of my frustration. ? Compression - Moving forward on pricing from EES. Oakhill and Baygas still look promising to close this quarter. Chris met with Duke and after the meeting, decided that Baygas could not be closed until third quarter. Received an email from Goodpasture that cc'd Prentiss - have not had time to address it. Will do so tomorrow. ? Wellhead Desk - moved to 32. P&L is lower due to ""system issues"" between TAGG and Sitara for the booking of some wellhead transactions. ?

As per our internal meeting on Wednesday, I questioned Stephen about Duke's evaluation based upon the data provided thus far. Enron has provided Duke with the Gathering Agreement which contains the guaranteed revenue stream. I informed Stephen that Enron would like to know a notional type value for the Pluto gathering line. We both recognized that the value would be highly dependent upon the discount factor being applied to the revenue stream. Stephen informed me that Duke's evaluation to date showed a value in the $14 to 15 MM range. Stephen stated that management had not reviewed that evaluation. However, based upon the notional value Duke has derived, it appears that Duke is using a discount factor very similar to the factor Enron is using. I stated that there should be some reserve upside and future option value. Based upon this discussion with Duke, I would recommend that we proceed with setting up a Mariner meeting to review geophysical data and begin trying to get Marathon approval for release of the Production Handing Agreement (PHA).

"Louise, I spoke with Tom Byargeon this morning while he was at the Offshore Technical conference. He has spoken with Rick Fowler, Dominion, and plans on visiting him in New Orleans next week. The highlights from the conversations are as follows : ? By the end of this week or next, he will have information on two more total depth wells that have been drilled. Based on the rumor mill, the reserves associated with the Devil's Tower acreage are looking even more promising. However, nothing is definite until all data is received. ? Based on the well data, Rick has three financing options : ? Negotiate exclusively with a company like Enron ? Synthetic lease financing with a commercial bank ? Rebid ? Since Dominion is now 80% owner in Devil's Tower (bought out Mariner's 20%), the credit profile of the project looks better. (Pioneer is the other 20%.) Rick realizes his mistake going with a company that has no equity backing and has egg on his face with upper management. My concern is that based on his experience, he will take the easy way out and align himself with a commercial bank. ? Enron has the following in their favor: ? Convergent and Enron's bid were very similar except Convergent had Aker. (Dominion wanted a guarantee of an Aker spar.) Tom has spoken with Bob O'Sullivan from Aker and he is interested in aligning himself with Enron. As such, we can bring Aker back to the table. ?

"John, It is not relevant that it is not standard practice within ETS to grant origination for closed deals. On ECF's behalf, Bilberry and Hilgert negotiated a storage transaction that brings significant value to your business for which they should be appropriately compensated and rewarded. Also, the PRC process within business units is often not an appropriate mechanism to validate a person's P&L for transactions closed across business subsidiaries of Enron. The value associated with the storage transaction was indeed a significant component of P&L to the overall Formosa deal. I do not understand how you could infer that the deal was worth over $50 million to Enron. At best, the current value of the closed transaction across EGM, ECF and ENA is under $10 million. In addition, EGM did compensate Bilberry and Hilgert for their origination efforts associated with the unwind of the TEPPCO contract and incremental transportation volumes from Williams. I certainly hope we can work out this P&L issue to incentive employees to work on transactions across business lines.

In addition, overall, the Wellhead desk should create a net cost savings across the scheduling and logistics natural gas organization for the following reasons: 1. The number of schedulers needed on the regional firm desks should be less - a. Scheduling between pooling points is relatively easy b. The Wellhead support is responsible for all the scheduling and logistics duties between Wellhead and pooling point - which comprise most of the deliverability risk 2. The Wellhead desk has currently, at most, four schedulers for the whole country - a. How many schedulers are associated with the firm desks?

"SURVEY FINDS PRODUCERS PLAN TO SPEND MORE THAN ORIGINALLY PLANNED IN 2000 06/19/2000 Petroleum Finance Week (c) 2000 Phillips Business Information, Inc. Oil and gas producers plan to increase their worldwide exploration and production expenditures by more than they anticipated at the beginning of the year, Lehman Brothers Inc. found in a mid-year update of its annual E&P survey. ""The 326 companies we surveyed are planning on an 18.2 percent increase, versus a 10.2 percent rise budgeted in December,"" said James D. Crandell, who follows oil services and drilling for the New York investment banker. He emphasized that the gain by the 326 producers in Lehman's survey reflects increases in budgets for 2000 and not underspending of budgets during 1999. ""Among the companies that were included in our December 1999 and May 2000 surveys, global spending actually came in slightly above what was estimated to have been spent during 1999 in December. It also indicates that nearly $6 billion has been added to 2000 worldwide exploration budgets since December,"" Crandell said. The survey's respondents said that they planned to increase U.S. E&P expenditures by 17.6 percent, up from 15.9 percent earlier in the year. Crandell said that the greater increase was driven almost entirely by independent producers. ""In our survey, 227 independents indicated E&P spending growth in 2000 of 26.1 percent versus a 22.9 percent increase budgeted for the year in December,"" he indicated.

I negotiated a contract between ENA and ECT Merchant Investments Corp. whereby we will manage the firm and swing portions of this transaction through our wellhead desk. The negotiated contract has financial keep whole language for the firm portion of this transaction and George will be able to manage the swing volumes. We will be receiving the volumes at the Texas Gas meters rather than the wellhead. Preston is required to transport this gas to the Texas Gas meters by moving the gas across the producer owned gathering system and Preston will be assuming those gathering fees. The volumes are currently split 50-50 between Texas Gas metes 9437 and 9502. Based on our information, we actually expect 87% of the volume at meter 9437 and 13% of the volume at meter 9502. With respect to the ECT Merchant Investments Corp. and the ENA contract and the St. Mary's Production, LLC and ENA contract (""Preston"" deal), George Weissman and Melissa Graves will assume responsibility for having our records and deals properly updated. They will also work closely with Eric Wardle, ECT Merchant Investment",gary.bryan@enron.com,jean.mrha@enron.com,"'George Weissman' : 'person', 'Melissa Graves' : 'person', 'Eric Wardle' : 'person'",3,St. Mary's Production LLC VPP,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,received,jean.mrha@enron.com

"Jean, Based on Richard's reply, I am OK with the strike.

I don't have Gerald's e-mail address so would you please forward this to him. Gerald, My reasons for striking the sentence are: 1) I couldn't figure out what it added to the prior sentence. 2) I'm concerned it negates Article 4, which states that, except as otherwise provided in the agreement, Confidential Information will only be used to evaluate, negotiate, and consummate proposed Transactions. The stricken language could be interpreted to allow the use of the Confidential Information to acquire businesses, facilities, contract rights, etc. At a minimum, the stricken language should be modified to make it clear that a Party may not use Confidential Information received under this Agreement in pursuit of such activities.

"Jean, Saw the first pass of names today with their progression history. We don't have a 100 yet, but I think once we refine the searching/gathering tool we can get close. ( We have had problems gathering the data due to multiple sources of data retention ... have to piece the history together) Trying to only use names that have an impressive history and are ranking in the top three performance categories. I will have good examples with progression history for tomorrows meeting.

"SURVEY FINDS PRODUCERS PLAN TO SPEND MORE THAN ORIGINALLY PLANNED IN 2000 06/19/2000 Petroleum Finance Week (c) 2000 Phillips Business Information, Inc. Oil and gas producers plan to increase their worldwide exploration and production expenditures by more than they anticipated at the beginning of the year, Lehman Brothers Inc. found in a mid-year update of its annual E&P survey. ""The 326 companies we surveyed are planning on an 18.2 percent increase, versus a 10.2 percent rise budgeted in December,"" said James D. Crandell, who follows oil services and drilling for the New York investment banker. He emphasized that the gain by the 326 producers in Lehman's survey reflects increases in budgets for 2000 and not underspending of budgets during 1999. ""Among the companies that were included in our December 1999 and May 2000 surveys, global spending actually came in slightly above what was estimated to have been spent during 1999 in December. It also indicates that nearly $6 billion has been added to 2000 worldwide exploration budgets since December,"" Crandell said. The survey's respondents said that they planned to increase U.S. E&P expenditures by 17.6 percent, up from 15.9 percent earlier in the year. Crandell said that the greater increase was driven almost entirely by independent producers. ""In our survey, 227 independents indicated E&P spending growth in 2000 of 26.1 percent versus a 22.9 percent increase budgeted for the year in December,"" he indicated.
