This has been an eventful and challenging year for Enron. Now, more than ever, it is fitting to bring Enron's leaders together. After all, it is up to our management team to lead our company through these challenging times. Together, we will define Enron's character and determine Enron's destiny. We have a great program planned for this year's conference. I'm delighted that General Norman Schwarzkopf will join us as a keynote speaker on leadership. I'm equally pleased to welcome back Gary Hamel, who will help us process the past year and prepare for future success. As I've said before, we are a company that continues to look to the future, and there are many exciting things in store for us. I look forward to seeing you at this very important meeting. Regards, Ken Lay NOTE: This year, registration for the Management Conference will be conducted electronically.

"This is the other teacher. Please add to contact info. -----Original Message----- From: Corman, Shelley Sent: Monday, October 15, 2001 3:26 PM To: 'VTRAYLOR@houstonisd.org' Subject: Question About Flat Stanley Project Hi Ms. Traylor, I gave my mom a heads up that ""flat Stanley"" would be arriving in the mail soon -- but it seems like recent mail jitters are coming into play. Before poor Stanley is needlessly tossed on fears of biological terrorism could you confirm whether Master Stanley might be in a brown envelope? I didn't have Ms. Jung's email. Hope all is well with you. I am so pleased with how happy Chad is with school. At first he expected to be coddled like Kindergarten and complained that 1st grade was too hard. Boy how things have changed in a month. Yesterday he told me that he was so happy that school was hard -- Kindergarten was soooooo boring. I really appreciate the firm, yet compassionate manner you have with the kids. It is just what Chad needs to develop. While I'm writing, I will also mention one thing to you in case it comes up at school. Over the summer we hosted a 4-year old orphan girl (Alina) from Kazakhstan. She had to return to her orphanage while we complete paperwork to adopt her. The other day, Chad was watching TV and saw a picture of some Afghan children. He commented how much they look like Alina and then burst out in tears. If the school works on a project for the Afghan kids",shelley.corman@enron.com,ricki.winters@enron.com,"'Corman, Shelley' : 'address', 'VTRAYLOR@houstonisd.org' : 'email', 'Ms. Traylor' : 'person', 'Ms. Jung' : 'person', 'Chad' : 'person', 'Chad' : 'person', 'Alina' : 'person', 'Chad' : 'person', 'Alina' : 'person'",9,Another Contact,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,received,ricki.winters@enron.com
