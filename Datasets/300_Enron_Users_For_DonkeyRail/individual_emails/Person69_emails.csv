If you remember, these are the risk employees that I was concerned about when Steve Jackson tendered his letter of resignation. Steve will be taking a similar role with a competitor, and it is not inconceivable that he might approach some Enron employees to join him and help ensure his success with his new employer. We don't want this to happen. Waiting until the end of November to implement an effective retention plan does not make sense. Please call me tomorrow and let's talk about how we can jump start this.

"Dear Managers & Supervisors, Thank you for your participation and contributions to the Year End 2000 PRC process. It was a privilege for me to witness all of you making decisions that were beneficial to Enron and the development of the employees that you supervise. Now what remains to be done is to give your employees their feedback verbally and in written form. I encourage all of you to complete your employee's evaluations before bonuses and merit increases are given on 2/5/01. Please remember: All employees in non-bonusable categories must have their performance evaluations reviewed by HR and Legal before the evaluation is presented to the employee. Rankings will remain confidential and will not be communicated to employees. HR will participate as observers of some reviews.

"Hiring Managers, Here are a few tips that will immediately improve the time it takes to make a offer to your candidates. All applicants must fill out and sign an Application and a Fair Credit Reporting Act form (included with the application) prior to being interviewed. You may either have the applicant fill out a form before you interview them or you can send the applicant to the 36th floor to fill out the forms before you interview them. Notify Hector McLoughlin or Frank deJesus if you are interviewing an external candidate that is a former Enron employee. All previous Enron employees will be reviewed by HR and Sally Beck prior to being invited to interview. We hope that this process will eliminate re-hiring poor performers. If you want to make an offer of employment to a candidate for a Management Position, please include Sally Beck in the process for input. As a final step of the selection process, Sally would like to meet with the candidate if time allows or to phone interview the candidate as an alternative. Sally's involvement should occur after you have identified the candidate as a potential Management new hire. Thanks for your help with this process.

If you want to add to this please don't hesitate to do so. We will form a questionnaire tailored to your group's needs. The right candidate will desire an environment that will challenge them with new situations on a constant day to day basis. This person would become bored and restless with routine. This person would also enjoy learning at a relatively fast and voluminous rate. The candidate will rarely lose a train of thought despite interruptions and can return to the point at which a discussion or idea was disrupted. There are techniques as well as questions that can address this. The person must indicate a high degree of dependability, endurance, follow-through, and persistence. They must be equipped with an ability to cope with adversity and be willing to do what it takes to get it done. They must not be adverse to working beyond the 45hr week.

"Dear Managers, Now would be an optimal time to assess the progress or lack of progress of your staff members as it relates to Mid-Year PRC. I encourage you to do the following: ? Ask you direct reports for their current 2001 goals along with a status report of their progress. ? Ask your direct reports for a brief self evaluation of their contributions to date for PRC purposes ? Sit down with your direct reports and talk to them about their areas of improvement that need to addressed and goals that need to be met that will impact the employee at Mid-Year PRC if they are not attained. This will reduce the chance of miscommunication between you and your employee when you have to deliver difficult messages or where there may be disagreement about current performance levels. As you already know by now, Frank and I always ask if the issues that are a part of the PRC have been addressed and documented in the recent past with the employee.

"Is everyone responding to you on this? If not, who are you missing? I talked to Hall, Perlman and Rub this morning and I assume Sweeney is easy since all his operations people are EIM and EGM. Also, Apollo and Dayao are probably EES but confirm with them. Get hem all to respond back to you directly. This is also going to be very fluid. For example, Hall has 43 names or so and we all know that probably and additional 60 or so will get put back to the estate off the UBS list if they go with their plan to take less not more. Although all of Hall's folks are ENA, the actual names may change. Also, Jenny Rub has about 100 employees remaining in infrastructure. This would be desktop support, phones, the network, data centers, etc. and although some techs are dedicated to certain business units, the majority of her group will just support EWS/estate as a whole as they always have. Her infrastructure group will therefore be shown to you as an org chart with what certain functions groups of people support. Perlman is attempting to break out but she normally divides by commodity or application, like Unify which cuts across commodities. Do the best you can. Thanks.

"Hector: The key employees that Jeff has identified are senior specialists, with the exception of Will Kelly.

Steve will be taking a similar role with a competitor, and it is not inconceivable that he might approach some Enron employees to join him and help ensure his success with his new employer.

"I can access the global compensation system from London. Today I have been able to log on and to review as read only the info that I submitted on Friday for bonus and LTI. I assume that I will be able to access the screens for merits as well. Please get back with me via e:mail and let me know our instructions and time deadlines for merit increases. I will want to give my direct reports access to the system so that they can input their recommendations. I will also want to send them an e:mail with instructions and expectations. Having asked for more funds for the bonus pool, I would like for us to be within the guidelines for merit increases. Outside this process, we can address any increases that may be warranted given the market data gathered by Todd Burke. We can process those agreed upon requests, but will not include those dollars within our merit totals. That way, won't have to request additional dollars for these worksheets. Better not to ask for exceptions on everything!!! What is the word on bonus dollars? Is everything finalized as I submitted? Let me know.
