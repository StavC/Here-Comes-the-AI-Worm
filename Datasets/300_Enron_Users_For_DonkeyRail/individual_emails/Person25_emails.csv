There is a risk that EML will give the Metals affiliate a taxable presence in the UK - this is exactly the same situation that we have with ECTRIC/EEFT here we have the risk that ECTRIC will be deemed to have a UK tax presence because EEFT acts as its dependent agent. We manage this risk by ensuring that the commission earned by the agent adequately compensates the agent for the functions it performs in the UK. A better understanding of who would do what and where is required to formulate a view on this issue. 2. The commission earned by EML should not be subject to US tax (in addition to UK tax) as (depending on the facts) it will probably be treated as commission earned by EML in the ordinary course of its business as a broker/dealer.

In essence there are 2 steps - Firstly there is approving the GTCs and the product description. As Justin said this done by the relevant lawyer for the jurisdiction or more particularly the Enron counterparty. If the decision is to use US law the counterparty would be ENA. In this case an EWS lawyer in Houston would give the signoff to both the GTCs and the product description. (The two are handled together). Conversely if Japanese law is chosen then the Enron counterparty that would do an OTC trade for that product in Japan would be the counterparty. That I assume would be EJ. Which choice of law and counterparty to use? It has been the practice to follow the currency. For example in understand ENA offers Japanese and Australian weather in USD. There is also a final legal signoff given by Mark Taylor. This is generally a formality as Mark would be primarily concerned that relevant lawyer has given their OK. Secondly, each counterparty needs to be approved to trade the product. This is done by the lawyer responsible for the product (ie the one that approved the GTCs) as well as the lawyer where the company is incorporated/resident. Hence I would assume you would be approving Japanese counterparties irrespective",alan.aronowitz@enron.com,legal <.taylor@enron.com>,"'Minns, David' : 'person', 'Timothy, Justin' : 'person', 'McBride, Jane' : 'person', 'Niesler, Stefan' : 'person', 'Aronowitz, Alan' : 'person', 'Keogh, Alison' : 'person', 'Jane' : 'person', 'Justin' : 'person', 'Mark Taylor' : 'person'",9,FW: Enron Japan - EOL - Yen denominated WTI swap,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,sent,alan.aronowitz@enron.com

John expressed a wish to commence proceedings against Hyundai. His analysis is that since Hyundai would exeprience the same high cost of arbitration and given the fact that they are Koreans (by that I presume he meant they are not inclined to be contentious), it may be worthwhile to pursue Hyundai in addition to the vessel owners. As for the legal advice of a weak case against Hyundai, he remains unconvinced.

"Jane: Typically, we have been widely successful in convincing counterpaties (wherever located) to agree to either NY or English law to govern ISDA's because NY and England have well developed bodies of financial law and the courts are more likely to understand derivatives transactions. I also have understood from Terry Taneka at IBJ (and an ISDA director) that Japanese financial institutions regularly agree to NY and English law. I realize here we are talking about a Japanese insurance company counterparty. I think, in this instance, it is ok to agree to Japanese law and courts to get this first Japanese Weather deal documented, but I would like for us to strongly reserve with this company the right to discuss further the choice of law/jurisdiction since I presume we will be negotiating a Master Agreement with them. Also, the submission to jurisdiction clause should be non-exclusive. My previous understanding from Jeremy Pitts of B&M was that ISDA's (and the subject derivative transaction) are enforceable under Japanese law (and that netting is also generally enforceable). I also have understood from B&M that Japanese courts are very preferable to Japanese arbitrations. Please confirm these points with Jeremy before finalizing the document. We will need to finalize our thoughts about the markets we are trying to develop and what the best approach should be to choice of law/jurisdiction going forward.

(or its successor or its successor's parent company) shall have long-term, senior, unsecured debt not supported by third party credit enhancement that is rated by S&P below ""BBB-"" [also insert Moody's as appropriate]; I understood yesterday that we may also need to consider changing the definition of Credit Support Provider in the ISDA's. I suspect that if ""Credit Support Provider"" is defined as Enron Corp. in the relevant Master, then the corresponding changes noted above would also need to be made. Your further thoughts regarding this issue are welcomed.

"We are in the process of restructuring the EGM Legal Forms Directory so that our forms and precedents can be available to everyone who works full or part-time in the group. The goal is to centralize all forms and precedents pertaining to each of the commodities and businesses supported by EGM Legal. A ""precedent"" would be a document from a deal you have worked on or otherwise that you think other members of the group should have access to in order to get ideas for developing other documents and agreements. Precedents will not necessarily be converted to forms, and accordingly, would be used without form reliability. A ""form"" would be a document already approved as a form within Enron Legal or EGM Legal. We are going to establish a process for approval of forms, the details of which will be disseminated at a later time. In order to facilitate this process, we have set up a special working folder as indicated below: A ""Drafts"" folder for each of the attorneys in our group has been set up in ""O:\Legal\Global Markets\Forms\DRAFTS"".

"Alan: Regarding the legal comments below: My impression was that the Joe had settled the choice of law issue: i.e. the umbrella documents (Password Application and Electronic Trading Agreement) will be identical to those used in North America containing a New York choice of law provision. These agreements have been approved by local counsel in Japan. This is till my recommendation unless the commercial team decides that a document governed by Japanese law is essential. As is the case for all EnronOnline trading, the online GTC's governing various commodities contain an appropriate choice of law for that product (e.g. English law for UK gas, New York law for US derivatives, etc.) regardless of where the counterparty is situated. When a Japanese product is offered, I would assume that you will create a GTC governed by Japanese law, but last I heard that bridge is still ahead of us. I don't know what the ""international contracts"" are that Rousseau refers to. There is no standard agreement for online trading. The ETA provides that if a counterparty and the relevant Enron entity have a master agreement in place (such as an ISDA Master Agreement for derivatives trading [is this what Rousseau had in mind?]) such master will control the relevant transactions. The choice of law in that master would be the subject of negotiation at the time the master was signed. In summary, unless the commercial team has changed its mind on the documents, the legal side of things is ready to go.

"Thanks, Alan. I just got off the phone with the other candidate, Donald Duncan, and he, too, appears strong. Donald has been an in-house energy lawyer in Houston for 24 years, most recently with Eagle Global Logistics (EGL), an international freight forwarder, which he left in May. EGL is suffering severe financial problems which comes as no surprise since their principal client base are the computer manufacturers and tech companies that have all suffered dramatic losses over the past 3-5 quarters. Notably, Donald spent 9 years with Pennzoil's mining business and, as such, is intimately familiar with the coal industry. He also worked on a major coal seam degasification project for Sonat in the '80s in the Black Warrior Basin of Alabama. Donald has the advantage of being familiar with both the coal and freight industries and of being already in Houston. He is very interested in you and, as with Jerry Prager, let me encourage you to call him directly if you are interested in speaking with him. He is available anytime after 2:00 p.m. today and anytime tomorrow morning. He can be reached at 713.515.4863.

"In view of the importance of this issue it is desirable to deal with it in detail. 1. The Issue The essential issue we are focussing on is that set out in my email of May 12, i.e. the need to avoid the possibility of a counterparty being able to claim that the transaction is not binding because: (a) it was outside the company's business purposes, or (b) execution of the application was not authorized. This issue is not unique to Japan There is no question as to any specific Japanese laws impacting on the trading of any of the products through the internet, including issues as to contractual enforceability of contracts entered into via the internet, on which we advised on 15 March. A copy of that advice is attached to the bottom of this email. Neither is there any question, if the above issue is resolved, of the Electronic Trading Agreement and General Terms and Conditions forming part of the contract. (We understand Mark Taylor to be concerned on this aspect.) 2. Enron's Practice re EOL Our understanding is that: * Potential customers have been sent the password application under cover of a letter from Joseph Hirl inviting them to complete the application. Neither the letter nor the application form indicate who is expected to sign the form. * Completed applications are reviewed by Enron primarily from a credit standpoint but also, we understand from Mark Taylor, to quickly confirm the authority of the signer (by e.g. in the case of a U.S. counterparty, checking if the signatory shows the title ""director"" alongside his name). * If satisfied, Enron then ",paul.tyo.davis@bakernet.com,alan.aronowitz@enron.com,"'email' : 'email', 'email' : 'email', 'Mark Taylor' : 'person', 'Joseph Hirl' : 'person', 'Mark Taylor' : 'person'",5,Enron Online: Counterparty Authority,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,received,alan.aronowitz@enron.com

"This is a forward power contract. It is actually a one-off contract so no master agreement (and no CSA at least at the moment). It's an option arrangement whereby we have an option for each of four years (years 2-5 of the deal) to supply power at preagreed terms. We pay the option premium during year one by means of a rebate to the customer of a fixed % of their electricity costs. I guess we just have to include additional provisions to the agreement covering the various credit issues which need to be dealt with, but I am not quite sure where to start in a stand alone agreement situation. Sorry about this. Thanks. Ps. We are under enormous pressure to get this deal done ASAP and in any case by Christmas - this is the first forward power deal we will actually sign.
