"In Staff's report on its investigation of the bulk power markets in the east, the Midwest report notes on page 2-15, Additions to Capacity, that new generation has been added in the Midwest region, and that some market participants believe that developers sited new generation in the Midwest because there were no price caps. Steve Kean suggested that we refer to this finding in our November 20 comments on the California order and specifically draw the conclusion that no price caps leads to more generation development.

"I spoke with Craig Glazer (PJM Wash Rep) yesterday afternoon regarding the status of the northeast RTO efforts. As you may recall, we, along with many other market participants and PJM, advocated a Board makeup for the new Northeast RTO board of 5 PJM Board members, 3 NY board members, and 2 NE board members. New York and New England are pushing hard for parity - 3 from each board. PJM is concerned that FERC is going to take the political way out and go with parity. Our concern with this approach has always been that if all three ISOs are equally represented, progress will not be made in forming the new RTO because the other two ISO board members will retain their bias and preferences for their own ISO sturucture, and development of the northeast RTO will be delayed indefinately. These three ISOs have been working on the seams issues, through the MOU process, for the past 2 years and absolutely nothing happened -- no progress was made. FERC recognized this in its July 12 order on mediation. If FERC does take the political route and order parity on board makeup, then it is imperative that FERC issue a clear, unambiguous order directing that the PJM system be implemented, that not many changes are made to the PJM platform (in the form of ""best practices"" from other ISOs), and that the new Board members' fiduciary duty must be to the new RTO. If they go this route, we would also want FERC to require that PJM management and staff be the Project Leader in seeing that the new RTO",sarah.novosel@enron.com,richard.shapiro@enron.com,'Craig Glazer' : 'person',1,Northeast RTO,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,sent,sarah.novosel@enron.com

"EPMI won a moral as well as financial victory today in the continuing MAPP refund proceeding. In response to EPMI's protest of MAPP's refund report, FERC issued an order rejecting MAPP's report, finding that MAPP erred in failing to make total refunds to EPMI and others. As you may recall, in response to the complaint filed by EPMI in 1997, FERC issued an order in April, 1999, finding that MAPP had overcharged EPMI and other transmission customers for transmission service. FERC ordered MAPP to make refunds to EPMI and the other transmission customers. In order to make refund payments to customers, MAPP sought payment from its transmission owning members. One transmission owning member, Nebraska Public Power District (NPPD), refused to pay MAPP, arguing that it is a non-jurisidictional entity and should not have to pay FERC-ordered refunds. Because NPPD refused to pay MAPP, MAPP refused to refund to transmission customers those amounts assessed against NPPD. When MAPP filed its refund report with FERC (as required by FERC in the April order), MAPP stated that it was not refunding those amounts owed by NPPD. EPMI protested MAPP's report, arguing that MAPP is responsible for paying the full amount of refunds, regardless of its dispute with NPPD. In its order issued today, FERC rejects MAPP's filing, stating that ""[w]e agree with Enron.""

"I spoke with Paul on Friday regarding his meeting with Adam Wenner and Doug Nickles to discuss Portland General's concerns about the Show Cause Motion. While Doug was unsure of whether an RTO commitment would be necessary in a future sale of Portland General, Adam Wenner assured Doug that FERC would definately require Portland to make an RTO commitment. In the last attempted merger with Sierra, Portland made a commitment to join an RTO, provided that BPA was also part of that RTO. PGE explained that because its system is so intertwined with BPA, that it realistically could not join an RTO without BPA. FERC found this commitment, with the BPA qualification, to be acceptable. While PGE would probably be willing to make the same RTO commitment that it made last time, the Show Cause Motion goes farther than that. We say in the Show Cause Motion that every entity must make an unqualified commitment to join a FERC approved RTO. It does not provide for exceptions. A couple of things came out of Paul's meeting with Doug. First, Doug asks that we delay filing the Motion for a couple of weeks, to see if anything happens regarding a new sale of PGE. Doug is concerned that if we make a commitment before an agreement is reached, that the existence of the commitment could delay entering into a final sales agreement.

FERC rejects the New York and New England RTO proposals and directs the three ISOs and all interested parties to participate in a mediation led by a FERC Settlement Judge with assistance from outside consultants. The purpose of the mediation proceeding is to facilitate the formation of a single RTO in the Northeast. The mediation must begin within one week from today and must conclude 45 days thereafter. The Judge must then submit a report to the Commission 10 days thereafter, which will include an outline of the proposal to create a single northeast RTO, milestones for the completion of intermediate steps, and a deadline for submitting a joint proposal. While the Commission has not formally extended the RTO implementation date (currently December 15, 2001), Chairman Hebert made comments a couple of weeks ago and again today that perhaps the December 15, 2001 may have to slip some. We will continue to monitor this issue. Donna Fulton is sending separately a write up of similar action the Commission took with regard to the Southeast RTO effort. Please call me if you have any questions or comments. Sarah",sarah.novosel@enron.com,"kevin.presto@enron.com, mark.davis@enron.com, jeff.ader@enron.com,

VAN VACTOR Energy Crisis Myths Mythology has always been an important part of the human experience and never more so than when hard choices must be made. Thus it should come as no surprise that our current energy crisis is accompanied by a seemingly endless array of apologies, exaggerations, and myths. Far and away the most common myth concerns the persistent view of many that suppliers are holding back generation in order to jack up prices. Similar charges were levied during the oil crises of the 1970s. In those days, critics complained that tankers could be seen just off the coast, waiting until prices rose. Holding back on electricity sales makes even less sense because once a moment of demand has passed, it is gone forever. No rational supplier will turn down the price offers persisting in the present marketplace day after day. Indeed, most suppliers are laboring to squeeze out every electron possible from aging and unreliable generators. An equally common error arises when the crisis is blamed",sarah.novosel@enron.com,"steven.kean@enron.com, richard.shapiro@enron.com, linda.robertson@enron.com,

"On December 26, SoCalEd filed a Petition for a Writ of Mandamus against FERC regarding FERC's December 15 order, asking the Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit to direct FERC to establish and order ""just and reasonable cost-based rates"" for sales in the California ISO and PX markets. SoCal requests that the Court act by January 5. SoCal argues that its lenders have said that unless FERC acts immediately to ""restore creditor confidence"" in SoCal's ability to repay its loans, that SoCal will not be able to access additional funding, so that by mid-January SoCal will be unable to buy electricity, resulting in rolling blackouts to its customers.

"John and I met with the group headed up by NERC that supports reliability legislation. Included in the group are: NERC, CEA, EEI, APPA, TAPS, ELCON, EPSA, PJM, Entergy. The group is attempting to reconvene and indicate their continuing support for the reliability legislation (33 pages) that was drafted last year. Enron, ELCON and EPSA did not support the final drafted legislation, although we are told that Enron (through Dan Watkiss) was close to giving its support. This group still supports the legislation that was drafted last year and would like Enron to give its support as well. ELCON has many concerns with the legislation, and EPSA is still on the fence (waiting to hear from us, I think). John Shelk and I indicated to the group that Enron is reassessing the legislation and our position on the legislation. Another meeting (conference call) is scheduled for June 15. Enron seems to be somewhat of a linchpin in this debate -- the group thinks the legislation will be effective if Enron signs on, even without ELCON's support, but they seem to think it has less effectiveness without Enron. Therefore, the group is very anxious to hear our position. John and I are meeting with Dan Watkiss tomorrow to find out from him where we left off on the drafting.

The bad new is that the protests are quite significant. In addition to the two protests Adam addresses, there was a protest filed by the Nevada Public Service Commission, and an additional protest filed by Truckee Donner. The Nevada Attorney General's Bureau of Consumer Protection also filed a brief protest. We are getting a copy of the rest of the protests now and will have a more detailed summary of all of the protests early next week.

"I spoke with Chuck Shoneman and Randy Rich (another partner at Bracewell also working on the case) yesterday regarding their estimate of time and cost to prepare a memo responding to the questions in the presentation. Upon further reflection, Chuck thinks that, in order for the law firm to provide a useful and informative document, the memo must be pipeline specific. He thinks that he can prepare the memo within the time frame discussed (aiming for end of July 4 week but no later than mid-July), for about $30,000 (plus costs, estimated to be about $5,000). However, in order to meet this time frame, they will need some upfront information. Specifically: 1. Based on the three pipelines we discussed, they would like to get the FERC case docket numbers where FERC issued certificates for the particular storage facilities being considered. Because these pipelines have many storage fields, it will save a lot of time and money to have these docket numbers up front. The pipelines should have this information available. If we cannot narrow down the facilities that we're looking at, the law firm's response memo will not be as useful and they may not be able to meet our timing requests. 2. Additionally, the law firm would like to have all of the settlements and side agreements that the pipelines have entered into with its customers regarding the storage facilities at issue. The law firm's analysis will be impacted by these agreements, and obtaining the settlements from public records would",sarah.novosel@enron.com,"paul.bieniawski@enron.com, miguel.vasquez@enron.com, donna.fulton@enron.com,

"I spoke with Paul on Friday regarding his meeting with Adam Wenner and Doug Nickles to discuss Portland General's concerns about the Show Cause Motion. While Doug was unsure of whether an RTO commitment would be necessary in a future sale of Portland General, Adam Wenner assured Doug that FERC would definately require Portland to make an RTO commitment. In the last attempted merger with Sierra, Portland made a commitment to join an RTO, provided that BPA was also part of that RTO. PGE explained that because its system is so intertwined with BPA, that it realistically could not join an RTO without BPA. FERC found this commitment, with the BPA qualification, to be acceptable. While PGE would probably be willing to make the same RTO commitment that it made last time, the Show Cause Motion goes farther than that. We say in the Show Cause Motion that every entity must make an unqualified commitment to join a FERC approved RTO. It does not provide for exceptions. A couple of things came out of Paul's meeting with Doug. First, Doug asks that we delay filing the Motion for a couple of weeks, to see if anything happens regarding a new sale of PGE. Doug is concerned that if we make a commitment before an agreement is reached, that the existence of the commitment could delay entering into a final sales agreement. Second, we need to decide how to deal with the PGE commitment.

"Attached are our power point slides laying out the time line for FERC action. The estimated time frames for FERC action, even without a settlement, are somewhat more positive than we discussed yesterday (e.g., FERC order on the merits after a technical conference by mid-February). Also, the group is somewhat optimistic that the FERC order in November could be an order on the merits, without additional proceedings such as a technical conference or a hearing. These optimistic time tables are based on the assumption that Sierra will not take any action that will alienate or annoy FERC, which could result in a slowdown in FERC's approval process. Adam Wenner, Steve Angle, Sam Behrends, Joanne Rutkowski and I all discussed the various time frames that are laid out in the slides, but they have not seen the slides, so we would like to reserve the right to amend the slides once everyone has a chance to review them. Also, as we discussed yesterday, we would like to be able to revise the slides, if necessary, tomorrow once we get FERC's agenda for its November 8 meeting and we see what action FERC takes in the California investigation on price spikes this past summer.

All the parties except PGE/Sierra/Nevada agreed to eliminate the export fees. PGE/Sierra/Nevada made a joint filing asking the FERC to require the RTO West to include export fees and their effect in the financial modeling of their Stage 2 filing. I think we should consider filing comments to oppose this requiest from PGE/Sierra/Nevada for the following reasons: Elimination of the export fees is a positive step to resolve one of the three major ""seams"" issues. With RTO West taking the lead, the other RTOs (CAISO & DSTAR) can follow suit. The nature and type of export fee to be used would have to be developed. This eat up an enormous amount of time on a speculative fee which the majority of the parties are opposed to including. The delay engendered and use of limited resources is unconsiounable. We can reiterate our concerns regarding allocation of rights instead of an auction and about the potential exclusion of facilities from the RTO West control.

"Sarah Novosel and I are hearing rumors from the FERC that the two new RTO dockets on the agenda for tomorrow may be orders in the Northeast RTOs and the Southeast RTOs respectively, requiring single regional RTOs. The orders are still being worked on, but may include technical conferences or settlement judge proceedings. Pat Wood is being credited again with pulling together a majority (including Massey who has wanted a more aggressive approach in the RTO process) to get these orders on the agenda and hopefully voted out.

"Mark: Faced with the price spikes in California, the new administration led by Governor Davis has been pretty hostile toward deregulation. Perhaps the administration's (and its California PUC) hostility represents a ""placeholder"" until the administration comes up with it's own plan to ""fix"" the mess that California refers to as a ""market."" As such, there hasn't been much coming out of the California PUC other than rhetoric regarding the fact that Republicans, not Democratics, restructured California's market and the desire to go backwards to good 'ol cost-of-service, command-and-control regulation. However, the ISO and the PX have issued interesting reports, which I'll forward in a seperate email. I look forward to seeing Prof. Littlechild at the conference on Monday.

"My thoughts -- 1. Great job. 2. I would change the message in the conclusion (and elsewhere) that the work should be done at the same time -- The Commission should act quickly to establish the scope and configurations of RTOs, WHILE ALSO WORKING and then begin the process of creating a standardized pro forma transmission tariff and market design to be implemented by these RTOs. 3. Thanks for getting in ""Network Plus"" - it's the little things that matter. 4. Maybe strengthen that just standardizing is not enough - real integration across seams is imperative.

"Steve - Our discussions this afternoon produced the military analogy. I researched the air traffic control system this evenning at home (internet access still out at the office) and came up with the following: The Air Traffic Control Systems Command Center, located in Herndon Va., controls all the airspace in the U.S. While they do not talk to the pilots (unless it is an emergency), they control the controlers in all the sectors in the U.S. A description from an article describes it as the following: ""Some air traffic controllers work at the Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA) Air Traffic Control Systems Command Center in Herndon, Virginia, where they oversee the entire system. They look for situations that will create bottlenecks or other problems in the system, then respond with a management plan for traffic into and out of the troubled sector. The objective is to keep traffic levels in the trouble spots manageable for the controllers working at enroute centers."" The point is, while there are controlers who control areas around airports, zones, and sectors across the country, there is one entity which tells them where to route and re-route aircraft based on weather conditions, emergencies, backlogs at airports, etc. While I am sure they have a backup for the facility in Herndon, the point is, there is only one and that is to consolidate control - particularly in an emergency.

"Sarah -- Looks fine. Did Craig Roach contribute? I wonder if we should highlight the Interconnection problems we are having with new generation? I know that most of the delays are Siting related, but it is unclear to me if the ISO or the local utility is the right point of contact. This would help us nationally and gives FERC an ""answer"" - enforce your Interconnection policies!! Also, this doesn't mention any possible market flaws. Do we think that some exist? Are any of the AS markets manipulated? EPSA needs to make sure that it takes an honest approach to this situation or its credibility will be destroyed. Has Craig Roach looked into this?
