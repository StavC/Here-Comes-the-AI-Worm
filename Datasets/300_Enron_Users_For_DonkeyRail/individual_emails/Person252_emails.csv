"I understood the ""validation"" process to be a fairly flexible name applied to a wide variety of approaches. What we specifically discussed, and what scott s. left prepared and committed to do, involved looking at individual curves, the assumptions underlying them and some process (yet to be specifically determined) for addressing updates. We agreed to start with the top 20 curves and especially those which are involved in the upcoming deals. I think the confusion is in what the term validation means. In the ENA context it means one thing; in this context it means what we discussed (which was in Jim's memo and, as you'll recall, we went through point-by-point).

The projection is based upon EIA's monthly analysis of delivered gas prices for residential, commercial and industrial customers for selected states (Connecticut, Virginia, Illinois and Texas) for the 1999-2000 winter heating season (Nov-Mar). Assuming pipeline and LDC mark-ups remain constant, the delivered prices were adjusted for the NYMEX Henry Hub projection of wellhead prices for the 2000-2001 winter period. A national projection is also included. Because the commodity portion of the gas bill for residential customers is a smaller percent of the total bill compared to commercial and industrial customers, the increase for residential customers will be less pronounced than for commercial or industrial customers. In addition, LDC purchased gas cost mechanisms will moderate the effect of the price increase to some extent because monthly price increases are averaged out over an extended period (12 months in some cases). Furthermore, some state public utility commissions (e.g. Connecticut) are conducting meetings with LDCs to discuss",steven.kean@enron.com,"elizabeth.linnell@enron.com, miyung.buster@enron.com","'Steven J Kean' : 'person', 'Robert Neustaedter' : 'person', 'Steven J Kean' : 'person', 'Richard Shapiro' : 'person', 'James D Steffes' : 'person', 'Mark Palmer' : 'person', 'Harry Kingerski' : 'person'",7,Natural Gas Price Increase,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,sent,steven.kean@enron.com

Background Going back almost three years, John Stinebaugh and I started looking for a more efficient method to finance generation projects. We explored two avenues, creating a Master Limited Partnership (""MLP"") or a Real Estate Investment Trust (""REIT"") to own the projects (with Enron as a manager). The advantages of a MLP or a REIT structure are twofold (i) they provide direct access to the public equity markets and (ii) they provide a lower cost of equity capital because earnings are taxed at the ""equity holder"" level, not at the MLP/REIT level, i.e., you do not have double taxation on earnings as with a publically held ""C"" corporation. John and I pursued these avenues with Jordan Mintz because we wanted to create an off-balance sheet vehicle that would provide a lower overall cost of capital so that ENA could be more competitive in bidding for acquisitions. The same vehicle would also have provided ",steven.kean@enron.com,"chris.long@enron.com, linda.robertson@enron.com","'Steven J Kean' : 'person', 'Mike J Miller' : 'person', 'Steven J Kean' : 'person', 'Joseph Deffner' : 'person', 'W David Duran' : 'person', 'Jordan Mintz' : 'person', 'John Stinebaugh' : 'person', 'Jordan Mintz' : 'person'",8,Tax Lobbying Initiative for Generation Finance Vehicle,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,sent,steven.kean@enron.com

Copyright Cato Institute Spring 2001 THE FINAL WORD CALIFORNIA IS IN THE MIDST OF AN ENORmous stupidity crisis. Californians have been sitting in the dark because ... they didn't turn the lights on. They say they're short of electricity. Yes, they are. Between 1988 and 1998, California's electricity consumption increased by 15 percent. Meanwhile California's capacity to generate electricity shrank by five percent, even as the state hesitated to build new power lines to tap into neighboring states' power supplies. Californians didn't want dams across their rivers, derricks on their ocean, power lines across their borders, or fossil fuel smoke in their sky. These might interfere with all the smart things Californians do, such as hang-glide. California was going to rely on ""negawatts"" - dramatic power conservation. (But California regulators put price controls on electricity that lowered prices, and even Californians weren't dumb enough to skip a bargain.) And California was going to rely on alternative power generation. With all the puffery from Silicon Valley dot.com start-ups, wind farms wouldn't be a problem.

"Dear Steve, Thanks for stopping by last week's Emissions Strategy Meeting. As you requested, I have attached the presentations from the meeting, as well as an agenda and participant list. The forum was well received by participants -- many found the policy updates and information exchange elements very useful. Several commercial groups expressed interest in continuing to discuss and share information on NOx, SO2 and carbon/greenhouse gas markets as they evolve. We also spent considerable time discussing U.S. ""multipollutant"" regulatory strategies, and received good commercial feedback on the proposals we have been circulating in Washington. From our perspective, the meeting was a success from a strategic standpoint, giving our group the needed commercial feedback to proceed with advocacy strategies and deliver information that is most useful to their businesses. Key Outcomes: ? Participants from commercial groups -- EES, EGMs, ENA, and Enron Europe -- expressed interest in competitive intelligence and policy updates on emissions issues. ? Commercial groups asked that Environmental Strategies, perhaps quarterly, bring a group together to be briefed on the policy landscape and environmental drivers for Enron markets. (Not likely to be a large meeting, but a conference call) ? Development of a list-serve or intranet site was suggested to facilitate communication among the participants. We are already working on a intranet site for delivery of information/intelligence, but will work to add elements where commercial groups can share information about business ideas or possible deals.

"Steve - when you get a chance, please take time to read David Merrill's status report below. Frankly, I think he is trying his best to get on top of the EBS tasks we have given him. HOWEVER, having said that, and before having received his report below, I was going to write you an e-mail indicating that I am afraid we cannot continue to keep David in this role. I just returned from Tokyo (office opening, meetings, etc.). There, I saw Sanjay, who confirmed his imminent new role for EBS Asia, Anthony Duenner (President, EBS Asia), and Bill White, head of EBS Asia Trading. David simply does not enjoy the confidence of his commercial clients in EBS, and, notwithstanding my comments above about the level of his effort, I do not see turning this around. His problem is not any single one thing, but a cumulation of things, which I list below, but I think it is the totality that feeds the general view: 1) He was probably only a decent fit with the old Enron APACHI, when it was asset-focussed, and he could use his diplomatic experience to open doors for projects. Even then, he was never an ""Enron"" person, in terms of our culture, and being isolated in Singapore has probably not helped to get him inculcated in the company culture. With EBS and Enron Asia taking a much more ""merchant"" business focus, he just does not get it. 2) Chris Hunt (APACHI), and Jim Row (ex-EBS) encoureaged him to develop/pursue origination leads",mark.schroeder@enron.com,steven.kean@enron.com,"'Steve' : 'person', 'David Merrill' : 'person', 'Sanjay' : 'person', 'Anthony Duenner' : 'person', 'Bill White' : 'person', 'Chris Hunt' : 'person', 'Jim Row' : 'person'",7,Status Report,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,received,steven.kean@enron.com

"Steve -- In a discussion today with Mike, Kelly, etc., it was apparent that the Public Affairs team viewed the Bahamas LNG transaction quite cautiously. Given the recent issues power plant development has had in Florida (big political fights that are going the wrong way), I was wondering if it made sense to bring together a meeting of all of Public Affairs and the deal team to analyze the implications of our development plans. My primary worry is that P/L under water could have severe ecological implications that are not being internalized into the transaction.

"Steve, I am very happy for Mexico. There is no perfect candidate, nevertheless the positive impact of finally having a change in the party in power after 71 years is beyond our forecast ability. At last, we are going to have more checks and balances in the system with all the benefits that they will bring to the country to a more democratic way of doing things. Also with the checks and balances everybody will have to listen, respect and negotiate with others. It's going to be fun. For us it means: 1. A couple of weeks ago I had a meeting with a key Fox advisor and we will have the opportunity to participate in the design of their energy policies, and as you remember,last year I worked closely with a group of PAN legislators (close to Fox) in helping them draft aan alternative proposal for the reform of the electric sector. 2. The unions did not vote for the PAN and they are the main stronghold against energy reform. The PAN has no compromise with the unions. 3. Industrials have backed the PAN and since yesterday energy reform has been on Fox's agenda. He said he would not sell assets but that he would open the industry to private investment. You have to start somewhere. 4. We should work very hard this summer and try to participate in the 2000-2006 National Development Plan which is a government plan that the new administration is obligated by law to create and publicize. I will offer 100% of my time to help them develop the energy part tof the plan. 5. There are rumors that our friend Luis Tellez is staying as well as some of his undersectretaries",ricardo.charvel@enron.com,steven.kean@enron.com,"'Steve' : 'person', 'Fox advisor' : 'person', 'Fox' : 'person', 'Luis Tellez' : 'person'",4,Re: Mexico II -- Wrong and Proud of It!,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,received,steven.kean@enron.com
"Steve: Joe called and asked me to summarize for you the meeting between Nick and Carla a few weeks ago. Nick outlined the current state of play in Tokyo. To summarize what I took as his central message -- now is a particularly sensitive time for Enron in Japan. They have a high profile and are establishing good relationships with the right government officials and business leaders, both publicly and behind the scenes. They're in the process of bringing on a senior Japanese national in the reg/government affairs team, and an experienced PR person as well. Both come with their own set of contacts and experience that Nick would like to give an opportunity to develop. With the electricity deregulation still shaking out, and Enron Online Japan just being launched days ago, Carla's high profile might be valuable at some point and on certain issues -- but now may not be that time. Carla replied that she understood the need for sensitivity. She outlined her contacts in Japan, which are impressive. She said she would only go to reinforce a message that a client wanted delivered -- to have another party support the Enron message to the right people is often valuable, especially in Japan. She said she understood timing, and reiterated that she was happy to help when called upon. No decisions were made on short-term travel by Carla to Japan.",stephen.burns@enron.com,steven.kean@enron.com,"'Steve' : 'person', 'Joe' : 'person', 'Nick' : 'person', 'Carla' : 'person', 'Nick' : 'person', 'Nick' : 'person', 'Carla' : 'person', 'Carla' : 'person', 'Carla' : 'person'",9,Nick O'Day meeting with Carla Hills,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,received,steven.kean@enron.com

"TAKING A HARD LINE PG&E Insists ratepayers pick up $3 billion tab for deregulated electricity David Lazarus, Chronicle Staff Writer Friday,?October 27, 2000 ,2000 San Francisco Chronicle URL: http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2000/10/27/B U47723.DTL&type=business San Francisco's Pacific Gas and Electric Co. plans to come out with guns blazing today when it makes its case to state regulators for why ratepayers should be saddled with about $3 billion in unforeseen power costs. But while the utility insists it is guided first and foremost by a sense of what is right and fair, the reality is that PG&E is maneuvering with its back to the wall. Wall Street, that is. ``No one wants to hold stock in a company that is subsidizing its customers,'' said Paul Patterson, an analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston in New York. ``If PG&E has to swallow this $3 billion, investors will run in droves.'' ``The whole idea of Wall Street is to enhance shareholder value,'' agreed Carol Coale, an analyst at Prudential Securities in Houston. ``PG&E's management has to be seen to be doing that.'' In documents filed with the California Public Utilities Commission late Wednesday, the utility said it will not be left ``holding the bag'' for outstanding electricity costs accrued when wholesale power prices spiked sharply higher during the summer. Because of a current rate freeze, the utility has been unable to pass along those",ann.schmidt@enron.com,steven.kean@enron.com,"'David Lazarus' : 'person', 'Paul Patterson' : 'person', 'Carol Coale' : 'person'",3,"TAKING A HARD LINE: PG&E Insists ratepayers pick up $3 billion tab
