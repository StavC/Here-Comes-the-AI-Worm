"Steve, You requested that I put together a Knowledge Management working group. To tell you the truth, I got the best support from Elizabeth Linnell. She did a splendid job of coordination and had great ideas of implementation. She kept the group alive. Our main obstacle, aside from other responsibilities, is that other groups, specially the eKnow team liked the idea so much that they started calling everything ""knowledge management"" or ""expert "" without a clear idea of all the implications. A positive discovery was that throughout Enron there are a number of efforts that are trying achieve a better situation with respect to information, communication and knowledge. Unfortunately many of this groups are not a priority within their business units. We have an operational pilot webpage with some interesting content. We also drafted two documents. A first draft of a business plan and a theory support document with respect to knowledge. Our last meeting must have been around August and it is my fault that we have not met again but it has to do with my workload in Mexico. I hope to continue with this project by establishing a monthly meeting to arrive to the full launch of ther program in our area A.S.A.P or whenever you set the deadline (2nd quarter 2001?) I would recommend implementation but, perhaps due to Elizabeth's and my responsibilities we would need someone else that devotes more time to the implementation of this project. I think it would be important to develop a working group for training within our area.

Basically in this bidding process they want to give the alternative of buiklding an IPP or of importing energy based on a long term contract. On the West coast the opportunity is the other way around. Theoretically we could export energy from Mexico to the U.S. The problem here is that the California ISO will not make capacity payments for a plant in Mexico.

"Jane, Since our meeting with you and Steve on Enron's worldwide view I have been working on a document that pretends to be a starter kit on how to go about changing the electric industry around the world. The main idea is that there is no standard recipe. What I think is that we have to go to the policy makers and try to convince them about change towards competitive electric markets. Then we can help them think through about the benefits of change and the opportunity costs of not changing. After that we would try to understand, together with them (and they should know more), the difficulties or challenges to achieve a vision of the electric inductry (that we should try to develop with them). Then we would help them design a strategy for change and with implementation. I am convinced that the closer we work and the more we know about what is going on the better. The document finally addresses specific issues and presents some discussion points related to those isues as well as possible solutions. You will recognize big chunks of this document as it builds upon your Electric Continuum and on Mark Shroeder's group Competitive Electric Markets, Key Factor For Success. Opinions and suggestions are welcome and in fact the last part is something that should grow over time. In fact I have suggested that different people develop on some of the issues. I am attaching a copy of such document for your kind review and comments. It has already been reviewed by Jim Steffes, Rick Shapiro and Margaret Carson.

"Rick, Steve, FYI Last week President Fox invited Jaime Alatorre to his trip to Canada. At some point they discussed energy reform and the need to bring in the private sector into the discussion to make sure that the new regulation was attractive to investors. After that conversation President Fox asked Jaime Alatorre to head an effort to build consensus in the private sector with respect to energy reform. He met today with Secretary Martens for 90 minutes to discuss strategy and implementation. I am meeting this afternoon with Marten's Chief of Staff, Mauricio Camps to give him materials and to discuss the main issues of the private sector and of the energy companies. I think it will be very important to be very close to Jaime on this in order to be able to give him the necessary technical and strategic support that he will be needing during this process. Probably a way to do it is to congratulate him and to offer help. We would then have to make sure that any of you have a periodical call with him for the group to have adequate information on the process and also to be able to identify areas of opportunity that will surely appear.

"Steve, Here are some thoughts on why I think this is important. (sorry for the length) Political One of the the main problem that I see with electricity reform and its ""benefits"" for the poor would mainly have to do with the redesign of subsidy policy. Subsidies should be focused to the consumer. In general, electricity rates in developing countries are highly subsidized. If there is a change in the cost structure the benefits will show in the government finances, that is, if you do not raise the rates for the residential users (especially for the poor). In the Mexican proposal it is not clear what they plan to do with the subsidies, but if they make a mistake it will become a social problem. I think there is an opportunity here but it requires the advice of economic experts. Economic Another way in which we could try to make an argument that electric reform benefits the poor is that it does so in two indirect ways: 1. Lower electric rates and quality of service for industrial users will enhance a competitive industry which will be able to grow in a globalized world or at least offer better prices for their products in the local economy. Lower electric costs decrease th cost of one of the supplies hence enabling the producer to reduce or not to raise prices resulting in a lower inflation rate. A growing industry creates more employment... 2. Private investment in the electric sectors will create employment but the most important aspect is that it will take away a heavy weight off the back of the government's finance. The government could then re- direct resources that it would have invest",ricardo.charvel@enron.com,steven.kean@enron.com,'Steve' : 'person',1,Re: World Bank energy report,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,sent,ricardo.charvel@enron.com

To enhance the possibility of having a competitive natural gas markets through importing gas in northern Mexico it is necessary to set a regulated price for the use of infrastructure which is in hands of a monopoly or where there is no alternative.. Currently Pemex is able to offer discounts in infrastructure (transport) and other services in a way which effectively creates barriers of entry to any competitor even in the marketing segment of the business. 2. Promote complete unbundling between Pemex affiliates in the gas business. There has to be a true unbundling between Pemex Production (PEP) and Pemex transport and marketing (PGPB). Currently anyone that wants to buy gas has to do so from the PEMEX marketer/transporter (PGPB) instead of being able to buy gas from the producer, pay for the transport etc. in a transparent way and within real competitive circumstances.",ricardo.charvel@enron.com,"richard.shapiro@enron.com, steve.kean@enron.com","'Joe Hillings' : 'person', 'Ricardo Charvel' : 'person', 'Ricardo Charvel' : 'person', 'Joe Hillings' : 'person', 'Minister Tellez' : 'person', 'Chris Long' : 'person'",6,"Re: Mexico-Secretary Richardson Is Leaving For A Mexico Meeting

Max and I had a conference call with Chris Long on Monday in which we touched upon some of these points but I think that it is important for us to insist in the following: 1 Regulate the pricing of infrastructure and services for true undiscriminated open access. To enhance the possibility of having a competitive natural gas markets through importing gas in northern Mexico it is necessary to set a regulated price for the use of infrastructure which is in hands of a monopoly or where there is no alternative.. Currently Pemex is able to offer discounts in infrastructure (transport) and other services in a way which effectively creates barriers of entry to any competitor even in the marketing segment of the business. 2. Promote complete unbundling between Pemex affiliates in the gas business. There has to be a true unbundling between Pemex Production (PEP) and Pemex transport and marketing (PGPB). Currently anyone that wants to buy gas has to do so from the PEMEX marketer/transporter (PGPB) instead of being able to buy gas from the producer, pay for the transport etc. in a transparent way and within real competitive circumstances.",ricardo.charvel@enron.com,"richard.shapiro@enron.com, steve.kean@enron.com","'Joe Hillings' : 'person', 'Ricardo Charvel' : 'person', 'Ricardo Charvel' : 'person', 'Joe Hillings' : 'person', 'Minister Tellez' : 'person', 'Chris Long' : 'person'",6,"Re: Mexico-Secretary Richardson Is Leaving For A Mexico Meeting

"Steve, Here are some thoughts on why I think this is important. (sorry for the length) Political One of the the main problem that I see with electricity reform and its ""benefits"" for the poor would mainly have to do with the redesign of subsidy policy. Subsidies should be focused to the consumer. In general, electricity rates in developing countries are highly subsidized. If there is a change in the cost structure the benefits will show in the government finances, that is, if you do not raise the rates for the residential users (especially for the poor). In the Mexican proposal it is not clear what they plan to do with the subsidies, but if they make a mistake it will become a social problem. I think there is an opportunity here but it requires the advice of economic experts. Economic Another way in which we could try to make an argument that electric reform benefits the poor is that it does so in two indirect ways: 1. Lower electric rates and quality of service for industrial users will enhance a competitive industry which will be able to grow in a globalized world or at least offer better prices for their products in the local economy. Lower electric costs decrease th cost of one of the supplies hence enabling the producer to reduce or not to raise prices resulting in a lower inflation rate. A growing industry creates more employment... 2. Private investment in the electric sectors will create employment but the most important aspect is that it will take away a heavy weight off the back of the government's finance. The government could then re- direct resources that it would have invest",ricardo.charvel@enron.com,steven.kean@enron.com,'Steve' : 'person',1,Re: World Bank energy report,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,sent,ricardo.charvel@enron.com

"Steve, I am very happy for Mexico. There is no perfect candidate, nevertheless the positive impact of finally having a change in the party in power after 71 years is beyond our forecast ability. At last, we are going to have more checks and balances in the system with all the benefits that they will bring to the country to a more democratic way of doing things. Also with the checks and balances everybody will have to listen, respect and negotiate with others. It's going to be fun. For us it means: 1. A couple of weeks ago I had a meeting with a key Fox advisor and we will have the opportunity to participate in the design of their energy policies, and as you remember,last year I worked closely with a group of PAN legislators (close to Fox) in helping them draft aan alternative proposal for the reform of the electric sector. 2. The unions did not vote for the PAN and they are the main stronghold against energy reform. The PAN has no compromise with the unions. 3. Industrials have backed the PAN and since yesterday energy reform has been on Fox's agenda. He said he would not sell assets but that he would open the industry to private investment. You have to start somewhere. 4. We should work very hard this summer and try to participate in the 2000-2006 National Development Plan which is a government plan that the new administration is obligated by law to create and publicize. I will offer 100% of my time to help them develop the energy part tof the plan. 5.

The conversation was more around when and how. On Friday I have to be in Houston for an EBS meeting on Mexico. I am planning to arrive there on Thursday morning to talk to Rick, to Dan Reck and to Shawn Cumberland. I also need to find out about relocation and visas , etc. I am writing you to thank you for your generosity in your advice and for helping me and encouraging me in making this important decision. I am also wirting because I am taking your word on Melissa's knowledge of the real estate market inside the loop. Elsa is coming with me on Thursday morning and we would like to see if it is possible for us to meet with Melissa on Thursday, Friday or Saturday for advice and orientation. (Of course you would be welcome to the real estate working session!!) Please let me know.
