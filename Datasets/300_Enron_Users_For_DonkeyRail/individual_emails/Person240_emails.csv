"It wasn't too bad. The phone company sent out a repairman Saturday morning and that is how I found out about all of the flooding because we had less than normal water accumulation from the rain Friday night. Lots of sunshine Saturday afternoon and most of the day Sunday. I spent some time shopping at Sam's Saturday and Haley and I cleaned my back room of the garage Sunday afternoon. I notice that the bikini car wash is still operating. They were out Friday afternoon when I went home about 5:30 just a few minutes before it started raining at the house, of course it rained hard on me most of the way home till I got about a mile from the house. I also noticed them out yesterday, however, I think they may have aged. Are you sure that James doesn't have an opening for them. They seem to be hard workers, at least they go through the motions.

"Texas City Facility - The relationship between HPL and Calpine has become and continues to be strained. Calpine purchased the Texas City Cogeneration Facility from Enron and Dominion Resources in early 1998. Prior to that time ENA supplied 45,000 MMBtu of gas under a fixed price contract and a Market Price agreement was in place to provide any additional volumes that might be needed in addition to that which Union Carbide Corporation had the contractual right to supply under the historic arrangement, since they were the steam host for the facility. After Calpine took over, these contracts either expired or were terminated. At this point HPL became the sole supplier to the facility although the interconnection with the Union Carbide delivery point with the Calpine facility remained active and a new Transaction Agreement was put in place whereby Calpine agreed to certain minimum and maximum quantity obligations and agreed on the prices that would be paid for any short fall in volumes. Since then, measurement disputes have been alleged and Calpine has shortpaid HPL's invoices even after verbally agreeing that the amounts invoiced were correct. Additionally, as a result of Calpine's power purchaser's last minute notification to Calpine of reductions in the purchase of power for the next day, which notification is usually after Calpine's next day notification deadline to HPL, Calpine has resorted to the use of creative force majeure situations in an effort to reduce their costs. These notifications have occurred some thirteen (I think) times and C",dan.hyvl@enron.com,barbara.gray@enron.com,"'Calpine' : 'person', 'Calpine' : 'person', 'Calpine' : 'person', 'HPL' : 'person', 'Calpine' : 'person', 'Calpine' : 'person', 'Calpine' : 'person', 'Calpine' : 'person', 'Calpine' : 'person', 'Calpine' : 'person', 'Calpine' : 'person', 'C' : 'person'",12,Calpine Cogeneration Facility(s) relations,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,sent,dan.hyvl@enron.com

"Yes. I believe that is correct. I will review the documents with regards to true assignment to a third party beyond assigning to an affiliate. But the transaction was structured to give Enron complete commercial flexibility with regards to restructuring or renegotiating the contracts. The sale is a bit more than a restructuring but the remedy is likely to be the same. Either Enron will retire the outstanding amounts under the monetization or give an indemnity for any losses associated with the transfer. The banks will likely accept either. Could you give me an idea of when the actual sale (cash changing hands) would likely take place. If we close with conditions precedent that are not likely to be met before 2001, I am less concerned about the negative funds flow issue of prepaying the financing. Regardless, I would imagine the outstanding amount under those contracts is getting quite small through five years of amortization. Thanks.
