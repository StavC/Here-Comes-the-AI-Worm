"This is to quickly summarize our call on July 11 on California gas intrastate matters and set a direction for future activity. Unbundling: PG&E has a Gas Accord in effect through 12/31/03, which is generally positive. We will participate in the development of a successor plan, and attempt to improve it if we can. SoCalGas attempted its own version of a gas accord, but the CPUC refused to approve. We will attempt to resurrect this accord and obtain CPUC approval. Hedging: No proceeding currently exists to address gas hedging by LDCs. (draft legislation does exist on the electric side to allow hedging and passthrough of costs). Jeff has recommended that we approach the LDCs to begin discussing the issue and developing a strategy to take to the CPUC. I suggest we develop an ENA-EES hedging proposal for CA and then take that to the LDCs. I will attempt to put this is writing. Infrastructure: CPUC has undertaken a proceeding to determine the need to improve infrastructure. SoCal Gas and PG&E are responding with proposals. We want to revitalize the infrastructure and ensure real markets exist and can develop. Our task is to participate in these proceedings. (Please let me know who I left off the mailing list).",leslie.lawner@enron.com,"k..allen@enron.com, harry.kingerski@enron.com, paul.kaufman@enron.com,

California imports about 25% of its electricity, but about 80-90 percent of its gas supply. California has failed to invest in the in-state infrastructure necessary to support increased gas demand over the last decade.

"(I feel like a reporter in a warzone) The morning was taken up with Barbara Barkovich testifying for CLECA and CMTA. She is a sharp witness and no one got anything off her she didn't want to give. She gave a long prepared statement that addressed equity considerations, conservation, and added that reliability is a key factor to consider, and that any allocation and rate design should encourage efficieny use of energy, should not disadvantage nay particular group disproportionately, and should discourage use in the periods most likely to see outages. The Top 100 hours as an allocator is equitable as it is an allocator that both accounts for capacity and energy use. Barkovich had no problems with SCE's billing determinants, but did have issues with PG&E's, as she couldn't figure out the appropraite revenue requirement from their exhibits and workpapers. She forgot to exclude CARE costs in her calculations (everyone else did too). She noted that the classes all have customers with wide ranges of usage, and rates should be designed to encourage conservation. Tiering might be a way to do that, but the problem is that the utilities have said that they can't do that right now. CLECA and CMTA do have different approaches; CMTA wants significant rate increases in the on-peak rates, a lesser increase for mid peak and an even lesser increase for off-peak. They prefer a broader spreading of costs than CLECA. SInce no one knows what the DWR contracts",leslie.lawner@enron.com,"ames.steffes@enron.com, scott.stoness@enron.com, tamara.johnson@enron.com,

"Paul and Jeff, Becky, Donna and I (gas girls) met with Phillip Allen (ENA West) to discuss FERC gas issues today, and Phillip had some issues that were more state than federal, and I told him I would bring them to your attention. He is interested in seeing incentive rates or more hedging on the part of the CA LDC's so that all their needs are not being served by the spot market. In the current market, hedges (longer term contracting and financial) are being done primarily by the producers and marketers, which results in a thin and probably off-kilter market (the LDCs buying for the customers are not participating). I know we have to square this with the EES positions, but I am not up to speed on what is going on in CA on this issue. Phillip also made that point that while the LDCs are focusing on their core load, no one is doing system planning on the macro basis, taking into account the ability of the physical systems to meet the needs of all customers, core and non-core and making sure the system will be adequate. Finally, he is very interested in seeing the CA LDC rates unbundled. Any updates we can provide to Phillip (and the gas girls) would be appreciated, as well as what our plans are to address these issues. From our side, El Paso is having a conference in July and we will be taking up a number of allocation and transportation issues at that time.

"Becky and I attended FERC's gas marketing affiliate conference last week. Non-affiliated competitors continue to build straw men and describe abuses with no real evidence to back them up (the funny money argument and capacity hoarding are two examples. The funny money argument assumes marketing affiliates will bid above market rates for capacity because they excess payment is going to the corporate bottom line. Hoarding capacity to drive up price may be an issue, but it is not a marketing affiliate issue, as anyone can do it). FERC staff did not seem terribly sympathetic to the points made, but at least one FERC staffer seemed to believe that one solution would be to require the pipelines to offer capacity in smaller blocks to let smaller entities put together bids. FERC also indicated they were in fact auditing compliance, but in a non-public way. There were some concerns voiced which I agree with and there is an opportunity to file additional comments on Apr. 30. I would like to put the following in these comments: Evidence of affiliate abuse/preference is just not there. The best folks can do is make up stuff. We welcome FERC monitoring if that is needed to bring confidence to the marketplace that abuse is not occurring. But the issue is really whether we do have a crisis of confidence or merely a bunch of disgruntled competitors who are just seeking to neutralize the affiliated competitors).

"Here is the list of pros and cons for Scott Stoness filing testimony in the CPUC rate design case (testimony due tomorrow, hearing set to begin next Monday). We have a call into Mike Smith to get legal's view. Pros of filing testimony: Getting out on the table a demand reduction program and a market-based pricing mechanism Favorable ""strawman"" proposal can move direction of CPUC decision in our favor Insurance policy in case no one files a proposal we like Can be withdrawn before hearing if we have other proposals we can support Could give us leverage to participate in settlement negotiations Easier to make case through direct testimony than on cross exam. Cons of filing testimony: We get in a position of having to defend our position and loose ability to throw support behind other positive proposals (alone or in combination) We open ourselves to cross examlination and discovery (Scott Stoness will be supporting witness and could have information we would not want revealed). Enron is not very popular these days and filing/testimony could fuel more negative press Additional Enron resources will be used (Scott's time, Tamara's time) Market dysfunction may help ENA's position Scott Stoness estimates that there is a $50 million risk if dollars are not apportioned properly to each rate class, but this is an issue that a number of parties will likely be addressing in their testimony.

"Here is an update of events at the CPUC rate design hearing today. The first panel was the Agriculture folks: California Farm Bureau, Cal. League of Food Processors and Leprino (biggest producer of mozarella cheese). They generally support the Governor's proposal and the ability of ag processors to switch to agricultural rate schedules, but admitted that this would lead to revenue shortfalls, which PG&E and others were quick to jump on. They want the ability to switch to ag rate schedules to avoid rate shock. The ALJ was very interested in the different segments of ag, and their needs, loads and usage patterns. Info on this will be filed by next week (fruit and nut usage, annual crop usage, processing, wine, dairy, beef and poultry). The County of Los Angeles witness testified that, as a big customer of SCE, they wanted to protect essential services from huge rate hikes, and that special rate treatment should be afforded to those loads identified in the exemption from rolling blackouts Any unrecovered costs should be collected from all customers except CARE and residential up to 130%. He supported allocating the increase in the same proportion costs are allocated to rate classes as in total current revenues (not just generation revenues). He also cautioned against imposing excessive charges on peak load, as this will encourage load shifting and not conservation.

"Randy, Becky and I just had a conference call with John Kroeger, attorney in FERC's Market Oversight and Enforcement Office, about the data request we just received from them regarding gas deals into California for May 2001. We explained that the data request we just received was in many regards identical to the one FERC staff sent us in December and which we answered in January and we directed him to that response, both for the explanation of how our business works and why we can therefore cannot answer the questions as they were framed, and also for an example of what the data will look like for the new time frame, if we submit it. (We may have to file written consent for Kroeger to review this previously filed data, which we agreed to do). Mr. Kroeger stated they wanted the data request to be construed with common sense (a refreshing notion). He agreed that the""contracts"" they want would just be deal tickets for the applicable time frame. He also indicated a willingness to extend the time so that we can file information when we get it in due course. He will get back to us after he looks at the info already filed in the SDG&E complaint.",leslie.lawner@enron.com,"richard.shapiro@enron.com, james.steffes@enron.com","'Randy' : 'person', 'Becky' : 'person', 'John Kroeger' : 'person'",3,Latest FERC data request,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,sent,leslie.lawner@enron.com

"Mike - Here is the situation. Between ENA and EES, we sell gas to core and non-core customers, and also have gas in storage as well as in the park and lend service. I think we can be sympathetic to the ORA argument that the diversion tariff penalties did not anticipate OFOs and EFOs in situations such as we face here (shortages due to credit problems rather than lack of supply). Assessing extreme penalties, as the OFO/EFOs would do, on users who are not perfectly imbalance under this situation certainly seems unfair. However, I think we should argue that limiting the payments to shippers/customers whose gas is diverted to serve core customers to a market index may not fully compensate for the diversion. The pay back specifically does not include interstate pipeline charges, and there may be other costs as well to the marketer/customer who had supplies taken away.

Non-affiliated competitors continue to build straw men and describe abuses with no real evidence to back them up (the funny money argument and capacity hoarding are two examples. The funny money argument assumes marketing affiliates will bid above market rates for capacity because they excess payment is going to the corporate bottom line. Hoarding capacity to drive up price may be an issue, but it is not a marketing affiliate issue, as anyone can do it). FERC staff did not seem terribly sympathetic to the points made, but at least one FERC staffer seemed to believe that one solution would be to require the pipelines to offer capacity in smaller blocks to let smaller entities put together bids.

A number of issues were put in our report, and I will get you a final copy this week (I think one will be available shortly). There is an implementation meeting in Alb. tomorrow. From TW's standpoint, a few issues stand out. First, producers and others joined in our frustation with the native American access issues (I did not raise them, but they came out loud and clear from the producers, which I thought was fine). Accordingly, the Townhall has recommended that our Congressional delegation use their bully pulpit power to call a summit with the energy industry and the indian nations to discuss right of ways, access, taxes, development and other issues.

Non-affiliated competitors continue to build straw men and describe abuses with no real evidence to back them up (the funny money argument and capacity hoarding are two examples. The funny money argument assumes marketing affiliates will bid above market rates for capacity because they excess payment is going to the corporate bottom line. Hoarding capacity to drive up price may be an issue, but it is not a marketing affiliate issue, as anyone can do it). FERC staff did not seem terribly sympathetic to the points made, but at least one FERC staffer seemed to believe that one solution would be to require the pipelines to offer capacity in smaller blocks to let smaller entities put together bids. FERC also indicated they were in fact auditing compliance, but in a non-public way.

"Hi Leslie: The proposal that ENA submitted to Peevey/Freeman includes a proposal to reduce demand by 400 MWs if the state implements financial incentives for such reductions (i.e., if the state is willing to pay, say, 7 cents/kwh to ""produce,"" it ought to willing to pay 7 cents to ""reduce."")
