For the purpose of finalizing the legal support (especially the review and ""tropicalization"" of the EOL agreements), I have a few questions for you: What entity owns the EOL site ? Will there be an agreement entered into between the entity that owns the EOL site and Enron Comercializadora de Energia Ltda. (and its designated branches) for the purpose of authorizing Enron Comercializadora de Energia Ltda. to use the EOL tool in Brazil ? For the purposes of doing business through the EOL tool, would Enron South America (and its designated affiliates) or ECE have to enter into the PA and the ETA with the entity that owns the EOL site ? Please note that I have only referred to ECE because I am working under the assumption that, at this point in time, we will only do power deals in Brazil. In view of this and for regulatory reasons, the entity buying and selling power in Brazil must be ECE (the Enron entity authorized by MAE).

"Mark; I've been working with Brazilian local outside counsel on this EOL matter and just had a meeting with Remi, David and Ricardo this morning. For the purpose of finalizing the legal support (especially the review and ""tropicalization"" of the EOL agreements), I have a few questions for you: What entity owns the EOL site ? Will there be an agreement entered into between the entity that owns the EOL site and Enron Comercializadora de Energia Ltda. (and its designated branches) for the purpose of authorizing Enron Comercializadora de Energia Ltda. to use the EOL tool in Brazil ? For the purposes of doing business through the EOL tool, would Enron South America (and its designated affiliates) or ECE have to enter into the PA and the ETA with the entity that owns the EOL site ? Please note that I have only referred to ECE because I am working under the assumption that, at this point in time, we will only do power deals in Brazil. In view of this and for regulatory reasons, the entity buying and selling power in Brazil must be ECE (the Enron entity authorized by MAE).

"Mark; Today, Brett Wiggs told me that there will be a significant number of cuts on our Brazil staff (including Legal) within the next couple of weeks. He asked me to think about a new structure to assist a small commercial team. I asked about John Novak and he said ""he will probably end up being repatriated and you will become General Counsel"". I was obviously a bit puzzled about his comments/questions and, since he was travelling to the Eletrobolt site today, I asked for some time before giving him any answers. I wanted to know from you if this is something I should discuss with Brett Wiggs only, or you/Brett, or you/Brett/Novak, or ???? If the Brazil office remains open/alive focusing (primarily) on power marketing activities, I am sure that Karla Azevedo and I could handle all the business guys. However, I anticipate that, within the next couple of months, there will be plenty of corporate work to be done in the near future such as Central Bank and Board of Trade matters (we would have to decide whether we keep Patricia Dutra in-house OR whether to outsource all corporate & institutional workload to outside counsel - I'd rather keep Patricia Dutra until everything is worked out well) as well as a lot of legal work to do on the Eletrobolt financing (where Luiz Watanabe and his trainee Aline Merone are focused).

The key issue of this structure is that the income tax on remittances to overseas that can be demonstrated to be remittances usual, normal and necessary for hedging transactions on the international market can be reduced by 100%. In addition to any positive results for the foreign institutions from these operations, the spread, commissions, premiums, and other related sums. when remitted abroad, will not be subject to any income tax withholdings.

If the Brazil office remains open/alive focusing (primarily) on power marketing activities, I am sure that Karla Azevedo and I could handle all the business guys.

The key issue of this structure is that the income tax on remittances to overseas that can be demonstrated to be remittances usual, normal and necessary for hedging transactions on the international market can be reduced by 100%. In addition to any positive results for the foreign institutions from these operations, the spread, commissions, premiums, and other related sums. when remitted abroad, will not be subject to any income tax withholdings.

"I would love to do that but I have a commitment on Saturday night in Houston. Thanks for looking into it for me. Next time. See you next week.

However, if you are willing to anticipate your flight (Saturday night instead of Sunday night), Corinthians is playing its oldest and strongest competitor Palmeiras on Sunday at Morumbi Stadium at 4:00pm. The most famous soccer games in Brazil are: Flamengo vs. Fluminense in Rio (""Fla-Flu"") and Corinthians vs. Palmeiras in S?o Paulo. Please let me know if you want me to get VIP seats for you and others.
