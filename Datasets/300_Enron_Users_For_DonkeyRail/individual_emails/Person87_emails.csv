I will be sending you more information on the Forum in the next few days. I am going to send you the preliminary agenda this morning. You will be speaking at a critical time in the Forum; that is, just after panels on power problems and polices and just before the final session linking power and energy strategies to environmental objectives. It would be great if your talk to the participants in the Forum could help them see the relationship between power and energy related objectives and environmental issues including GHG emissions. You should feel free however to focus your talk in a manner of your choosing. Again, I will send you the prelim. agenda soon. Could you send me a title however for the final agenda's purposes?

"Hi Liz - The reason Ken and Linda were trying to reach you from the plane was that they had some suggestions for the hotel rooms and wanted you to know their preference. They would like to give the Jasmine Suite that they are currently in to the Vittors with a connecting bedroom, to take care of their family. They would like Mark and Natalie to have the end or corner suite that the Vittors have. Ken and Linda said that they would prefer two connecting rooms, hopefully on the 3rd or 4th floor. They would like for the rooms to have the ocean view on the North side. If that isn't possible, it would be o.k. to overlook the pool, but they would not really like the south side as it wouldn't be as quiet. The two rooms would give them everything they need, with 2 baths. They said they can be reached in Switzerland tomorrow. The Hotel Meierhof's phone number is: 41-81-416-82-85, Fax is: 41-81-416-39-82. They should arrive in Davos about 9:00 a.m. I know you will have a beautiful and wonderful wedding!!

Unfortunately I will not be back in the US until December 7. The reason for my call was to see if you would feel comfortable putting my name forward to Dick Cheney for a position in the new administration. I am not sure where the best fit would be, but it might be Chairman of the National Economic Council. That job has a good combination of management and economics. You know I have only been associated with Democratic administrations in past, but Democratic administrations were a little different in those days. You are somewhat familiar with my record on economics and there is a lot on that in the public domain. Just let me know what you think.

"Rosalee - would you please forward this request to Ken. If he has some time over the coming week or so to discuss by phone, I would also appreciate that opportunity. Ken - Though a mutual acquaintance, my CV has been provided to Bob Zoellick, in the hope and expectation that he might become USTR, and with an interest on my part in being nominated to be one of his deputies. I am writing to seek any support and assistance you feel comfortable in providing in this effort. I attach a copy of my CV below. I would particularly call attention to the fact that I served in the Department of Energy as a Deputy General Counsel in the administration of the first President Bush. While I obviously could not contribute much time to the campaign given my current assignment within Enron, I did contribute financially. My wife and I gave $2,000 to the campaign to fund the primary effort, $2,000 for the General Election, and another $2,000 to the Compliance Fund. I also wrote letters seeking funds (using your fund-raising number), and while I do not think the response rate was high, I do know that at least some of the people I wrote to did contribute. I have discussed this interest in the Deputy USTR role only with Steve Kean and Richard Shapiro within Enron. I expect that if Bob is nominated in the next few weeks, that I will be making a trip to Washington to meet with him, as part a trip associated with some other US business. (And if Bob is not the USTR, I will, of course, remain",mark.schroeder@enron.com,rosalee.fleming@enron.com,"'Rosalee' : 'person', 'Ken' : 'person', 'Ken' : 'person', 'CV' : 'cvv', 'Bob Zoellick' : 'person', 'CV' : 'cvv', 'President Bush' : 'person', 'Steve Kean' : 'person', 'Richard Shapiro' : 'person'",9,message/request for Ken Lay,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,received,rosalee.fleming@enron.com
"Rosalee - would you please pass along the short note below to Ken? thanks Mark Ken - just an update on our German Federal Cartel Office proceeding, after your conversation with Ulf Boge. Our case has not yet been dismissed, and yesterday, took a turn for the better. One of the two utilities, GVS, who had refused to shoulder their share of the cost of the economic study that was to produce a fair rate, has now agreed to pay their share, and it appears that the study will go forward, so we may still get the precedent we are looking for. Apparently, they (GVS) may not have wished to be put in the position of being the ""poster child"" for why Negotiated Third Party Access does not work. I will keep you updated on any further developments. Thank you again for your intervention with Boge. With the way things work in Germany, it would not be at all surprising, if after your conversation with Boge, the word got back to GVS that Enron's management at the highest level was focussing on this case, and that it should not be seen as a failure of the Cartel Office.

Would it be possible for you to arrange a tour for a few of our executives, both from the US and the UK, say on the morning of October 30? Second, we understand from Irwin and from the press that you have done wonders in reinvigorating and revitalizing the BA staff.
