Bryan and I decided to start putting up the Christmas decorations this week. Sunday, we got the tree out of the closet and set that up in the living room. Our plan was to do a little bit every night. By Thanksgiving, we would have a beautifully decorated house. On Monday, Bryan put the lights on the tree. Then I started unwrapping some of the ornaments.... just to look at them. Well, after I unwrapped *all* of the ornaments, we decided to finish trimming the tree. Bryan was hanging back and letting me do most of the decorating. Though I did notice that one of the first ornaments that he put on the tree was my heart shaped Nicole ornament. After we finished, we sat in the glow of the big bulb lights and admired our tree. That was when Bryan informed me that I did not find my NEW ornament. He had put something new on one of the trees. (we have a charlie brown tree in the bedroom and the big tree in the living room.) I could not find anything new on the charlie brown tree so I moved to the big tree. After surveying the big tree for a few moments, the little girl in me said, ""Look for a ring, look for a ring"".

Subject: RE: Just curious We just refinanced this past Monday. We were going to do a 15 year at 6%, but changed our minds and decided to do the 30 year again, but could only get 6-5/8% (still much better than the 8% we had before). We are still going to pay on it like a 15 year mortgage, but the 30 years gives us flexibility to make the lower payment in case of an emergency. 5.75% sounds really good -- do you have to pay points to get it that low? I like 15 year loans for the interest rate, but like 30 year loans for the flexibility -- it's really a matter of personal choice. That's why we went with the 30 year and will pay like a 15 -- it costs a little more (due to int rate) than a straight 15 year mortgage, but is kind of an insurance policy because you only have to pay the small 30 year payment. Sorry to hear about the golf membership. I know how much you enjoyed that. We have focused this entire year on paying down debt, so we really haven't saved anything other than 401k and ESPP. However, we payed off my student loans back in March and will pay off the car next month (yeah!!). After next month, our only debt will be the house. -----Original Message----- From: Kuykendall, Patrick M.

"Our play toys nurture creative spirits. Remember what it was like to be a kid? You just couldn't grow up fast enough. Things haven't changed--your kids love to pretend they're just like you. In fact, chances are they're already imitating the things you do around the house. Playing with Dad's tools and dressing up in Mom's clothes are all a natural part of growing up. The best toys for imaginative play are ones that encourage kids to try out these new roles in a way that's safe and fun. Our Workbench Desk and Tool Kit let children pretend to fix things, and a Vanity Table and Makeup Kit make it fun to dress up for that special tea party.
