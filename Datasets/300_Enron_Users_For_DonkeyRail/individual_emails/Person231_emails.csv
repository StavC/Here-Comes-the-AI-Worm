"As previously reviewed with Mark, Karen and Scott, it is very likely that DPC will invoke the Government of India Guarantee tomorrow (late night tonight our time). Ken Lay was on the India call today and confirmed support for this approach, absent new developments. The India team feels strongly, and we agree, that we should clearly set the explanation of this action by issuing a press release. The press release would be issued by DPC for distribution in India only. However, the story and the release are almost certain to be picked up by the international wires. Attached for your approval is the proposed DPC release. It is deliberately not worded in Enron fashion. We believe there is a strong possibility that many Indian publications will take this release almost verbatim. Since it is lengthy and explains the issue, we also believe many publications will necessarily reduce the amount of space normally dedicated to opposing commentary. Of course, we will be armed with appropriate Q&As for use with international media. Please let me know whether or not you have any concerns with this approach (713-646-6423 or cellular 281-948-7273).

"APACHI management has been successful in delaying for at least two weeks the signing of a renegotiated agreement for phase II of the Lagos State project, a 548 megawatt power plant. This is part of the PPA that was originally signed and publicized in December 1999. Per our discussions, we sought a delay in the signing from this week to avoid undue publicity as a result of President Clinton's visit to Nigeria on August 26 and 27. There is still a risk that the Governor of Lagos may talk about the project, but we expect most reports to focus on the phase I emergency power barges and do not anticipate significant publicity about phase II. Furthermore, Habiba has carefully developed an agreement on statements and minimal publicity with NEPA and other government agencies, which should mitigate any leaks.

"Jim, The message you forwarded appears to be quite appropriate for the audience of South America employees. I believe there may be a need for a bit more explanation if it is necessary to respond to media inquiries. Only if asked, I'd suggest we respond to South American press as follows: I can confirm that Jim Bannantine and Diomedes Christodoulou have resigned from Enron to pursue other interests. We wish them well in their new endeavors. Both had begun the transfer over to other Enron's businesses several months ago, so the transition at Enron South America is already underway. We have a strong management team in place and every confidence in their continuing ability to manage the business effectively. In addition, for U.S. and major international media it may be necessary to provide some further explanation.

"Tracy, I'm sure you have no time for this now, but I wanted to get this information to you as soon as I had it. I am very concerned to learn that only a part (approximately 1/3 or $680,000) was allocated out to EGS units as part of Steve Kean's budget. (A disproportionately high $600,000 was allocated to EGM and the remaining $738,000 was retained at corp.) It is my understanding that $470,000 was budgeted for the ETS communications group. Recognizing that my proposed corp. budget already reflected a decrease of approximately $ 1 million from the 2001 budget and $5 million from its 2000 budgets, it will be tight, but we could do our work as an EGS group if we were able to get the EGS allocations ($680,000), ETS communications budget ($470,000) and the portion that was unallocated corp. ($738,000), for a total of $1,888,000. I presume the problem with this is that it includes $738,000, which was not allocated to EGS entities. Do you think this can be accommodated or should we look at keeping the budget at corp., with a reporting line to Stan? (I have not broached this with Stan.) I've attached spreadsheets with my corp. budget and Gina Taylor's ETS budget. When you have time, I would appreciate the opportunity to discuss this with you.

This is part of the PPA that was originally signed and publicized in December 1999. Per our discussions, we sought a delay in the signing from this week to avoid undue publicity as a result of President Clinton's visit to Nigeria on August 26 and 27. There is still a risk that the Governor of Lagos may talk about the project, but we expect most reports to focus on the phase I emergency power barges and do not anticipate significant publicity about phase II.

"Manager's Journal What Enron Did Right By Samuel Bodily and Robert Bruner. Messrs. Bodily and Bruner are professors at the University of Virginia's Graduate School of Business Administration. This is a rough era for American business icons. Subject to the vagaries of age (Jack Welch), product failure (Ford/Firestone tires), competition (Lucent, AT&T), technology (Hewlett-Packard and Compaq), and dot-bomb bubbles (CMGI), managers and their firms remind us that being an icon is risky business. The latest example is Enron, whose fall from grace has resulted in a proposed fire sale to Dynegy. Once considered one of the country's most innovative companies, Enron became a pariah due to lack of transparency about its deals and the odor of conflicts of interest. The journalistic accounts of Enron's struggles drip with schadenfreude, hinting that its innovations and achievements were all a mirage. We hold no brief regarding the legal or ethical issues under investigation. We agree that more transparency about potential conflicts of interest is needed. High profitability does not justify breaking the law or ethical norms. But no matter how the current issues resolve themselves or what fresh revelations emerge, Enron has created an enormous legacy of good ideas that have enduring value. Deregulation and market competition. Enron envisioned gas and electric power industries in the U.S. where prices are set in an open market of bidding by customers, and where suppliers can freely choose to enter or exit.",keith.miceli@enron.com,john.ambler@enron.com,"'Samuel Bodily' : 'person', 'Robert Bruner' : 'person', 'Jack Welch' : 'person'",3,FW: What Enron Did Right,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,received,john.ambler@enron.com

The most cost-effective and timely way of doing this is through e-mail, backed up with an intranet version and hard copies (in most cases printed off locally) for those employees who do not have PCs. The newsletter would supplement other communication channels, such as messages from you, eSpeak, floor meetings, site visits, your periodic meetings and normal management communication. We would like to see how much news and interest we have before making a final determination, but would expect this newsletter to go out once or twice a month. In addition to English, we intend to provide Spanish and Portuguese versions. We will work to assist local management if they feel that other languages are needed for their operations.
