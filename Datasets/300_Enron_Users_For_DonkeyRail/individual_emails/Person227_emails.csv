We will forward them as soon as we receive these from the engineers. How long will it take to get a notional price on filling the 200,000 gallon order?

As such, they are all set to supply our requirement. Doug reiterated his interest in looking at the long-term relationship we may want to build with a supplier. He is particularly concerned if the plant switches to oil for a significant amount, supplying large quantities will be a logistical nightmare. He agrees that we can hedge 80-90 (if not 100%) of the commodity risk by buying the Gulf Coast contract (there is no basis traded for FL). However, his market view is for prices to come off (they have already dropped a bit) as a result of gasoline prices cooling off. He has scheduled the test for Vandium today.

"Following are responses to your questions on the truck deliveries to the H.D. King Power plant location (Fort Pierce).

We expect an answer on the quality specs tomorrow from our engineers (they are determining whether the air permit or the turbine requirements will be the primary driver of our quality specs). We will forward them as soon as we receive these from the engineers. How long will it take to get a notional price on filling the 200,000 gallon order? Charlie and I will call later today to confirm your receipt of this email and to review any additional questions. Please call me at x36751 or Charlie at x57229 with any questions.

Standard fittings may be used or 3 inch quick disconnect fittings. 4) Full spec sheet--especially sodium and potassium guarantees The environmental specs are known but the specs on the turbine itself from Mitsubishi (MHI) are not known.

As such, they are all set to supply our requirement. Doug reiterated his interest in looking at the long-term relationship we may want to build with a supplier. He is particularly concerned if the plant switches to oil for a significant amount, supplying large quantities will be a logistical nightmare. He agrees that we can hedge 80-90 (if not 100%) of the commodity risk by buying the Gulf Coast contract (there is no basis traded for FL). However, his market view is for prices to come off (they have already dropped a bit) as a result of gasoline prices cooling off. He has scheduled the test for Vandium today.

"Columbia is taking expressions of interest in a project they are calling the Homestead expansion for firm (or possibly off-peak or seasonal firm) transportation into Operating Areas 1 and 10. The open season will end on 1/19/01. The project could include Columbia working with another pipeline in the region, such as Transco to deliver more volumes using Transco's South Virginia lateral or CNG to deliver more volumes on the PL-1 line. The project could include expanding Columbia's own line into Market Areas 33 and 34 through looping or added compression. Columbia is also considering building a line away from Loudoun, where LNG volumes will be delivered from the Cove Point pipeline, to power projects in Loudoun or Fauquier Counties in Virginia. Columbia has also considered an idea in the past to build a line from the Cove Point terminal to BG&E through Calvert and Anne Arundel Counties.

He agrees that we can hedge 80-90 (if not 100%) of the commodity risk by buying the Gulf Coast contract (there is no basis traded for FL).

"Columbia is taking expressions of interest in a project they are calling the Homestead expansion for firm (or possibly off-peak or seasonal firm) transportation into Operating Areas 1 and 10. The open season will end on 1/19/01. The project could include Columbia working with another pipeline in the region, such as Transco to deliver more volumes using Transco's South Virginia lateral or CNG to deliver more volumes on the PL-1 line. The project could include expanding Columbia's own line into Market Areas 33 and 34 through looping or added compression. Columbia is also considering building a line away from Loudoun, where LNG volumes will be delivered from the Cove Point pipeline, to power projects in Loudoun or Fauquier Counties in Virginia. Columbia has also considered an idea in the past to build a line from the Cove Point terminal to BG&E through Calvert and Anne Arundel Counties. Columbia indicated that they have talked with Bill Fox of VNG/ALG. Columbia would like to talk with us concerning VNG, Hopewell or any other needs that we might have.
