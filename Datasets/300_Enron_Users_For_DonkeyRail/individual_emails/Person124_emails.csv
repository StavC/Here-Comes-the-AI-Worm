"Dear juan, FriedWire Inc has just released a new version of our Traffic Report. Below is a snapshot of the new content: NEW EMERGENCY MAPS- We have added more than a hundred transmission elements (e.g. flowgates, transformers, power plants now totaling over 500!) to our geographic representation of TLR's and other market-moving announcements. To handle the increased resolution, we have developed two new maps that replace the Emergency Constraints map, providing even more information for users to easily digest in a color-coded, geographic snapshot. Now, the Emergency (TLR) map shows the entire U.S. with small white dots in the background that represent all the flowgates that are experiencing satisfactory conditions. Overlaid are larger color-coded dots signaling the flowgates that have some TLR level associated with them. The new TLR map will have greater differentiation than the old one, with TLR levels from 1 to 6 represented. When you click on one of the colored dots, you will see the name of the element and the TLR level in a pop-up box. The Market Notices map still has the regions colored when there is a market notice associated with them. You can click on a region and get a pop-up text box with the full text of the regional notice.

"Dear juan, FriedWire Inc has just released a new version of our Traffic Report. Below is a snapshot of the new content: NEW EMERGENCY MAPS- We have added more than a hundred transmission elements (e.g. flowgates, transformers, power plants now totaling over 500!) to our geographic representation of TLR's and other market-moving announcements. To handle the increased resolution, we have developed two new maps that replace the Emergency Constraints map, providing even more information for users to easily digest in a color-coded, geographic snapshot. Now, the Emergency (TLR) map shows the entire U.S. with small white dots in the background that represent all the flowgates that are experiencing satisfactory conditions. Overlaid are larger color-coded dots signaling the flowgates that have some TLR level associated with them. The new TLR map will have greater differentiation than the old one, with TLR levels from 1 to 6 represented. When you click on one of the colored dots, you will see the name of the element and the TLR level in a pop-up box. The Market Notices map still has the regions colored when there is a market notice associated with them. You can click on a region and get a pop-up text box with the full text of the regional notice.
