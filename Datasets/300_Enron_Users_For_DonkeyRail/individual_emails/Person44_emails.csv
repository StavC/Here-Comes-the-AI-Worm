"Enron's 2001 United Way Campaign focuses on making a difference to people severely impacted by the recent flood ""Allison"". All business units and Corporate functions will be participating in a Day of Caring, teaming with the following United Way agencies: Jewish Community Center, YMCA, Neighborhood Centers, and Center for the Retarded. The Corporate functions and EGAS employees' Day of Caring is on Wednesday, August 8, 2001, and we will be teaming with the Jewish Community Center to provide assistance to senior citizen meals-on-wheels beneficiaries. Activities that will be completed that day include painting, yard work, landscaping, cleaning, and various home repairs. The Jewish Community Center provides community services to individuals regardless of religious orientation. These services include: childcare, youth development, summer day camp, meals-on-wheels and congregate meals to the elderly, health and recreation programs, dance, drama and music programs, refugee services and other community services. The Jewish Community Center is responsible for providing approximately 40% of Houston/Harris County meals-on-wheels per day. Funding comes from a combination of federal and state programs, the United Way and individuals. I encourage every single employee to take at least half of your day on August 8th to participate in this effort. RAC's goal is 100% participation. It is a unique opportunity to truly make a difference in someone's quality of life, and you will be able to see first hand how your United Way contributions improve the lives of people in our own community.

For example, a $25 million, five-year exposure to a AAA counterparty with standard documentation is contemplated to be approved via this abbreviated approval document. This abbreviated approval document would only be available for transactions meeting these criteria if: (i) structured financing capacity were available, (ii) the funds flow issue created is manageable (both (i) and (ii) as confirmed by EGF), and (iii) the pricing met a threshold that included the structured financing cost, an appropriate credit spread/reserve, and a syndication risk premium.

City Light officials say the cost of buying power for local residents and businesses eclipsed the previous records - $84 million set in February and nearly $80 million in January. To put that in perspective: In 1999, before the current power crisis, the utility's total power bill for the entire year was $90 million. ""We're spending that every month now. The dollars that are involved are staggering,"" said Paula Green, deputy superintendent of City Light. It's a cash hemorrhage brought on by Washington's drought, which means less water in the reservoirs at city-owned dams. That increases Seattle's need to purchase electricity on a market where prices have zoomed to unprecedented levels. Adding to the frustration for Seattle city officials is the fact that most of that money is flowing to out-of-state utilities and power brokers who are profiting enormously from the energy crunch.

My comments follow: Cost: the DASH is incorrect. EECC has provided both a cost - plus price and a guaranteed price. EECC has provided a NEPCO-guaranted price of $215MM. EECC has indicated that it's estimate of actual costs is most likely $205MM. We indicated this cost estimate was somewhat conservative. Since last week, the cost estimate has been further revised to $202MM. It is unlikely that the actual costs of the project will be significantly less than $202MM. $202MM represents a cost estimate with the Owners maintaining the risk of overruns and schedule. This would require the Owner to maintain a contingency in his proforma above the most likely expected cost of $202MM. After providing the above information to the Developer, the Developer was going to take a look at the carrying cost of turbines which were inside this estimate; I have no update on whether the turbine price changed from the numbers I saw last week.

"Rick 1 Limits. Here's how I interpreted the BOD approvals: The BOD approved an aggregate of $150MM, with $50MM of discretionary VaR, plus the new policy which doesn't recognise the concept of discretionary VaR. So here's what I did: Effectively I allocated all the $50MM of discretionary such that Pug's ""Big Buckets"" are now as follows: US Gas $100MM US Elec $100MM Europe Gas & Elec $35MM Global Products $20MM Financials $15MM Emerging Businesses $20MM If you have a calculator handy you'll see that this aggregates to $149.164MM (assuming zero correlation). At Business Unit level the individual commodity limits are unchanged, and I have put limits over the Business Units themselves as follows: Enron Americas $82MM EWS OOC (aka George Martingale) $3MM EEL $34MM EGM $23MM EIM $8MM EBS $4MM PGE $4MM ETS $1MM Again I used root-sum-of-squares, and remember the original commodity limits (by VaR, net open and mat gap) are still in place (e.g. gas = $61MM as before). So that keeps it screwed down pretty tight and preserves the discretion between the ""Big Buckets"" and the Business Units. I spoke to Rebecca C who could only remember the decision outlined above, but offered to call Pug and let him know. I said I would come back on that. I think we should do that ourselves, possibly with Lay in the loop (?)",david.port@enron.com,rick.buy@enron.com,"'Rick 1' : 'person', 'Pug' : 'person', 'Rebecca C' : 'person', 'Pug' : 'person'",4,Policy and other items,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,received,rick.buy@enron.com

"As per our discussion, the first step was to identify the participants in the retention program. The next step is to build the business case for why these employees are critical and irreplaceable to your business unit. Please provided a brief rational for why these employees were selected. Additionally, if there is a unique situation or circumstance that makes your area more vulnerable, please included in an overall business summary. For example: if your unit has a limited number of people supporting a critical area necessary to maintaining or increasing the value of the estate or the liquidation of assets, include this in your business summary. Demonstrate why it would be difficult to train someone else to perform a similar function. You should also comment on why the employee was recommended for the Milestone Program. As you know this information is time sensitive, so please try and get it to me as soon as possible. I appreciate you taking time out of your busy schedule to meet with me on such short notice.

"Rick, Attached are a clean copy of suggested modification of the body of this DASH as well as a copy of the original DASH. This should give you some sense of the Arcos project's scale and risks. John Sherriff and Michael Brown reportedly remain confident that this can be sold at a profit in the next three to nine months; however, if it is not, our economics on this project with a current termination cost of over $200 million is a negative NPV of approximately ($150 million). The Enron board has not seen this, largely because the turbine cost is not specifically related to this project, but no other use of the turbines has been identified, so this project represents a huge potential loss if the sale is not successful.

"Focusing the right people on the right issues is always a good idea. I would like to visit with you to understand what you mean by ""operational issues"". My team has a meeting every other Monday focused on operational risk and we have various working groups that focus on key projects or initiatives that vary with need. A daily meeting on operational issues would need to have the appropriate team members there, and I hesitate to add an additional meeting to any key folks on my team if operational projects/initiatives are being covered either in our Monday operational risk meeting or in another forum. --Sally From: Rick Buy/ENRON@enronXgate on 04/23/2001 04:55 PM To: Sally Beck/HOU/ECT@ECT, Debbie R Brackett/HOU/ECT@ECT, David Port/ENRON@enronXgate, David Hardy/LON/ECT@ECT, Shona Wilson/NA/Enron@Enron, William S Bradford/ENRON@enronXgate cc: Ted Murphy/LON/ECT@ECT, Richard Causey/Corp/Enron@ENRON Subject: Operational Issues I think the daily IT issue meeting has been quite successful in addressing problems in systems and working toward resolution on systems related issues. I would like to expand the scope of this meeting to include daily operational issues as well. I plan on restarting my attendance at these meetings on Wednesday. Can the RAC people listed above please make a start at some of the recurring issues.

"Rick, This email was supposed to be delivered the week after the Happy Hour. Something went wrong and it never got delivered. I still want you and Karen to read it. Rick, Thank you for inviting us to the Happy Hour last week. As always these events help us to break the silos in which we tend to work some times. In this occasion I made two new friends and had the opportunity to discuss business maters with the people that work in Rick Carson group. After finishing the 3-Quarter revaluation process, I feel that Underwriting and Due Diligence can work much more closer, shearing information and experiences from the Due diligence site visits.
