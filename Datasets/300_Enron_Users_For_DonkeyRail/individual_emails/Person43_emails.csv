"Clement, Dan, Below is an e-mail from my counterpart at Coastal with comments to the revised Enron Corp draft that Clement provided to me in his e-mail on Dec.. 21st. Can each of you please review these concerns. If the Master will not be executed until after their merger with El Paso, I think it is OK to accept a Unified guaranty cap instead of specifif limits. I was origninally thought the reason for the specific dollar limits was because of Contracts.

As you are aware, this Contract has not been signed between Coastal Merchant Energy and Enron companies and will not probably be signed (if and) until our pending merger is completed.?

As I understand it, Gary will never be buying gas from his counterparty and this is the only transaction he plans on doing with the counterparty. If this is the case, I would think only a Master Sales agreement would be needed instead of a Master Purchase Sale Agreement and thus a Credit Worksheet is not needed.

Russell Diamond 01/05/2001 05:20 PM To: Mark Taylor/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: Tana Jones/HOU/ECT@ECT, Tanya Rohauer/HOU/ECT@ECT Subject: ISDA Collateral Question Mark, I copied a section of a counterparty's Bank Credit Agreement relating to certain negative pledges. The counteparty is IMC Global whom we have some financial transactions with (actuall their sub IMC-Canada) at ECC, and now an EES person is looking to enter into a long term EES transaction. We sent them a draft ISDA for future transactions out of ECC and we are now being told by the EES person that if a Credit Support Annex (CSA) is required in this ISDA it will kill her deal. She has stated that they are not able to fulfil the obligations of the CSA because of the covenants tied to their Credit support agreement. As highlighted in red below, it seems that they cannot have any liens that secure derivative obligations, although cash is acceptable up to $10 million. Can you please clarify if collateral as it is stated in the ISDA is considered a lien, and if this type collateral would be a breach of their credit agreement. If this is a breach can you suggest other methods that we might use so the CSA would be acceptable. Thanks Russell Negative Pledge.

"Russell, I have no problems with their few editing word changes other than we need to have a separate guaranty for the HPL contract. However, until they sign the master, their is no need to do anything because this is the identical guaranty that you currently have from coastal.

This Guaranty is a redline version that Coastal has provided comments on. At this time they do not want to negotiate the Master Agreement until they fully understand how their current positions will fit into El Paso's trading book with the upcoming merger. Please review the attached Guaranty and provide your comments. The contact ar Coastal is Dai Nguyen, her phone number is 713-418-4229.

"Any chance this language came from a credit facility that provides for the issuance of letters of credit? Russell Diamond 01/05/2001 05:20 PM To: Mark Taylor/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: Tana Jones/HOU/ECT@ECT, Tanya Rohauer/HOU/ECT@ECT Subject: ISDA Collateral Question Mark, I copied a section of a counterparty's Bank Credit Agreement relating to certain negative pledges. The counteparty is IMC Global whom we have some financial transactions with (actuall their sub IMC-Canada) at ECC, and now an EES person is looking to enter into a long term EES transaction. We sent them a draft ISDA for future transactions out of ECC and we are now being told by the EES person that if a Credit Support Annex (CSA) is required in this ISDA it will kill her deal. She has stated that they are not able to fulfil the obligations of the CSA because of the covenants tied to their Credit support agreement. As highlighted in red below, it seems that they cannot have any liens that secure derivative obligations, although cash is acceptable up to $10 million. Can you please clarify if collateral as it is stated in the ISDA is considered a lien, and if this type collateral would be a breach of their credit agreement. If this is a breach can you suggest other methods that we might use so the CSA would be acceptable. Thanks Russell Negative Pledge.
