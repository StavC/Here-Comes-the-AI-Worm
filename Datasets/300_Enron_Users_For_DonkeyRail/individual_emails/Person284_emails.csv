"Scratch that Gerald. A bit of miscommunication. I need to get a copy of the CA just to determine who formally has access to the information. It looks like the initial phase of peak load avoidance for TW will be to have Gas Control manually monitor the system and make the call themselves. Who specifically has access to the power load info. and what obligations do we have? I'm a bit nervous about turning the access to this web site loose. I have contacted Arnold who is now in the ET&S world (instead of EE&CC). The resources we had in-house during the actual project engineering and construction were set up to provide the automated load monitoring as part of our price quote. Since we are just now getting access to the info. via this CA that Courtney was working on I believe we will be releasing some additional $'s to the system in place. Arnold indicated that they won't be able to start until after the beginning of 2001.

"Hey Drew, Sorry that we did not get to meet last week when you were in town. I have pulled up some information on the project performance and wanted to share with the group. I was very concerned by the comment that the project was on a rate to cost TW an additional $1.0 million for the year because the demand avoidance program was not in place. I do want to confirm that Arnold Eisenstein at ET&S working on the development of the programming to support TW's efforts to minimize demand expenses. It was my understanding during the development of this project, that TW was targeting a 75% avoidance for an annual basis. I offer the following details regarding the actual operation of the station in 2000. Peak load for 12,000 hp = 9,621 kw x 3 = 28,864.0 kw per Quarter Actual Utilization 3rd Quarter 2000 % of Max 4th Quarter 2000 % of Max kw - generation 22,684.8 78.6 17,779 61.6 kw - transmission 25,421.0 88.1 22,992 79.6 Target $'s @ 75% 99,142 75.0 73,480 75.0 Net Actual Rebate $'s 75,935 78.6 105,181 61.59 difference ($23,206) $31,702 Overall net for 2000 under Rate 21 appears to reflect that TW has saved $8,496 above their target rebate of $170,622 (75% avoidance) for the 3rd and 4th quarters. In addition, ECS has made payment to TW under Rate 19 that resulted in an additional $118,441 paid to TW.

"No, we have not received any information from Gulf Power. Gulf's technical group has proposed two or three different configurations that do not agree with our Substation Design and Description package that was submitted back in Nov. or Dec. of 2000. My understanding of the issue/s really revolves around the ""reliability"" and the turn around time if a breaker or something like that breaks. Our design offers a much quicker turn around in the event of a failure (or lightning strike). The approach that Gulf's technical group is taking is causing our technical support from ET&S to be consuming much more resources and will end up costing ECS relative to the Project Management agreement with ET&S. I'm concerned about this because my understanding was that ET&S was providing some oversight and updates to ECS regarding the substation. It now seems more like a technical debate / negotiation that I felt was already defined.

"No, we have not received any information from Gulf Power. Gulf's technical group has proposed two or three different configurations that do not agree with our Substation Design and Description package that was submitted back in Nov. or Dec. of 2000. My understanding of the issue/s really revolves around the ""reliability"" and the turn around time if a breaker or something like that breaks. Our design offers a much quicker turn around in the event of a failure (or lightning strike). The approach that Gulf's technical group is taking is causing our technical support from ET&S to be consuming much more resources and will end up costing ECS relative to the Project Management agreement with ET&S. I'm concerned about this because my understanding was that ET&S was providing some oversight and updates to ECS regarding the substation. It now seems more like a technical debate / negotiation that I felt was already defined. Chris, I believe we may need to approach our counterparts at Gulf should this issue not be totally resolved by the end of this week. mk To: Mark Knippa/HOU/ECT@ECT, Chris Hilgert/HOU/ECT@ect cc: Subject: Gulf Power Construction Progress Have you guys received any information from Gulf Power concerning regular updates on the construction?

"Barbara, I've included the 1st draft that Gerald emailed to me before leaving on vacation. The text that I've inserted is in blue. There is some text that I've excluded relative to the ""Start Date"" because of issues that surround the commodities (gas and power) by not having a Firm Start Date. The concern will be what happens if the installation by ECS (or our appointee's like Hanover and Rusk County Electric Cooperative) is delayed (i.e. construction risk). My suggestion is to have the customer operate under the Test Period provision for the first 2 or 3 months of the deal and push the Start Date back. Ultimately we are still picking a date that everyone is comfortable that we can accommodate before taking financial positions with the commodities.

"Gerald, Generally there has been a gas sales agreement with ENA. Given that this transaction was done as ENA, it may have been handled differently.

Compression Services Agreement dated June 29, 2000 (I worked on this one. We basically restated the existing Compression Services Agreement with NNG to revise conversion factors to allow NNG to deliver ENA more gas and thus allow ENA to mark more earnings. NNG was able to book $2 mil of these earning as a fee paid by ENA to NNG in consideration for termination of the existing Compression Services Agreement) This agreement has a provision for submission of a purchase offer by NNG to ENA for purchase of the motor and interconnection facilities. No specific numbers are listed and the terms would have to be mutually agreeable. No events of default specifically listed (including bankruptcy). Thus it is not terminated. If ENA fails to provide HP there are LD payments due up to a maximum of $200,000 per contract year. Term is through January 31, 2018. 2.

"Mark, I reviewed the CSA for our obligations. They are as follows: 1. ECS will work with the Utility in good faith to establish the online monitoring automatic load controlling system for the No. 21 Schedule. 2. If the online system can not be established, then ECS will work with TW to develop a manual system to accomplish the same. ECS will keep TW whole on any costs for incremental manpower required for such manual system. This provision was written very generally.

I'm real interested to see what this is. Under our CSA we are required to provide TW/ET&S with some type of system to monitor the peaking from Tri-State (hence this conf. agreement). The resources that we needed from EE&CC are now gone due to the restructure between EE&CC, EES and ET&S.

Overall the commercial terms seem to be in line with all the discussions that have been referenced, although there are some issues we want to make vary clear or more apparent. 1) ECS is agreeing to a 3 yr term ""to buy power from Continental Divide"" assuming the merger is completed and power is available to ECS through the No. 21 tariff. 2) They have provided none of the information concerning a split demand charge that totals $12.21/kw. Discussions reflect that $8.86/kw is avoidable and tied to their monthly coincidental peak load and the remaining $3.35/kw is a base type demand. This is the basis of the rebate mechanism for TW. Note this is also a Tri-State portion and part of the tariff 21. 3) ECS is aware of more favourable contract structures that Tri-State has negotiated and wants to maintain the ability to utilize a more favourable tariff/contract structure or to negotiate specifics with Continental Divide post the Tri-State merger. We would still be buying from Continental Divide supporting their 3 yr term.

"Here is an update on Oakhill power sourcing: Wholesale Generation + Ancillaries ? Electric cooperatives and municipalities are exempt from retail deregulation. We can not directly contract with AEP or whoever the wholesale generation provider would be because it constitutes a retail sale in a non-deregulated area. The prevailing utility in the area must be the buyer of the power. ? Generation + ancillaries will be provided by the chosen entity, through NTEC, and then through Rusk. The wholesale generation + ancillaries contract will be a three party agreement between AEP (or whoever is chosen), NTEC, and Rusk. ? Swing - There are consumption penalties for using more or less than the contracted 5.0 MW 7x24 block (meaning there is no free swing). These penalties are part of the ancillary services, which means that we will not have the exact specifications until Rusk receives the bids on their RFP on 6/27/01. T&D ? T&D is provided directly by Rusk County Electric Co-Op. ?

Overall the commercial terms seem to be in line with all the discussions that have been referenced, although there are some issues we want to make vary clear or more apparent. 1) ECS is agreeing to a 3 yr term ""to buy power from Continental Divide"" assuming the merger is completed and power is available to ECS through the No. 21 tariff. 2) They have provided none of the information concerning a split demand charge that totals $12.21/kw. Discussions reflect that $8.86/kw is avoidable and tied to their monthly coincidental peak load and the remaining $3.35/kw is a base type demand. This is the basis of the rebate mechanism for TW. Note this is also a Tri-State portion and part of the tariff 21. 3) ECS is aware of more favourable contract structures that Tri-State has negotiated and wants to maintain the ability to utilize a more favourable tariff/contract structure or to negotiate specifics with Continental Divide post the Tri-State merger.
