"Gerald, I finally spoke with Tom Brown. Tom Brown expects the contract for gathering to be fully interruptable, with only the wells currently connected to the Wildhorse system now are to be included in the dedication of wells. The obligation for us to move any gas is contingent that the gas will meet pipeline specs. Thought the blending fee was a good idea, but bringing gas to a plant for processing would be negotiated at a later time. Bob doesn't know the South Canyon play very well - or there existing contract. He indicated that not only the price, but some other changes in terms was desired - not sure which ones are the most important. If you need anything else, let me know.

Included in the Open Season Offering NG Resources made with Wildhorse, we allowed IGI (a company that holds firm capacity on NWPL) to include a gas purchasing proposal for this gas. We really never discussed the Dakota gas delivery to NWPL until June/July. We could not change the nominations until October due to the long term gas sales contract assigned to us in the Enogex acquisition. We were under the impression that the long term contract was the only reason that Enogex was not selling gas on NWPL. (Wildhorse changed directions of flow along the old Mesa line in spring of 1988.

Once they accept the nom to NWPL, they have a first que obligation to move it there. From a practical standpoint, if Wildhorse curtailed us to NWPL (to our protest) after they had accepted our noms., I understand this would cause problems. However, if we nominate gas to Questar when Wildhorse is willing to accept a nom to NWPL, we would potentially be waiving damages there.

"Yesterday, Jim and I had a discussion with Tom Brown (Bob Mustard) and the potential new owners of the Wildhorse assets. The name of the company is Cantera Resources, Inc. They have offices in Dallas and Denver. They are a midstream gathering and processing company, predominately owned by Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. They recently (about 9 months ago) purchased the processing assets from TXU. The two gentlemen from Cantera on the line were Dave Kenyon (Denver) and Terry Klare (Dallas). They wanted to know about the Entrada gas and our low-Btu gas plans. We indicated that we are in the process of building a 24 MMSCFD plant at the South Canyon interconnect. Also indicated that while the San Arroyo gas was currently covered under an existing gathering agreement, the Badger Wash gas was not dedicated. We indicated that we wanted to bring 10mmscfd from San Arroyo and we could move anywhere from 8-15mmscfd from Badger Wash. All wells are drilled. We did not discuss third party gas. They indicated they are very interested in working with us on this low-Btu project. They also indicated that the only way they make money is by moving gas - as much as possible. The PSA for the transaction has not been executed at this time. Both parties indicated they expect to sign the PSA next week, with closing soon thereafter (no timeframe given). Once the PSA is signed, TBI has no objections to discussions between Crescendo and Cantera to proceed ",kckrisa@apex2000.net,"mark.castiglione@enron.com, mwhitt@enron.com, scott.josey@enron.com,

In subsequent conversations between Dan Rieneke and Wildhorse personnel yesterday, the following information was relayed: (1) The CAT compressor was used only for the Natural Buttes gas being routed through the South Canyon area. We are not sure where they took it. It was most likely a rental unit. (2) Increase in field pressures late last week was due to a compressor going down. Overhaul of that unit was not complete until late yesterday (Monday), and we should have started to see some pressure relief again last evening.

"Ken, Our position has been that Wildhorse doesn't have the right to curtail our volumes since we have a first que position. We could draft the letter such that we demand to send 100% of our gas to NWPL.

From a practical standpoint, if Wildhorse curtailed us to NWPL (to our protest) after they had accepted our noms., I understand this would cause problems.

Feel free to contact David directly to discuss. -----Original Message----- From: Marshall, David Sent: Wednesday, November 14, 2001 3:53 PM To: Nemec, Gerald Subject: RE: Comments to O&M Agreement Gerald, My comments noted. A few points: as I read the contract, client is paying for the insurance cost of BCCKOP, and therefore should get full benefit of those policies, not just limited to claims attributable to BCCKOP's gross negligence/willful misconduct. BCCKOP is in full control of the Facility and therefore should wear some financial risk for damage to it arising out of the Operating Services. I have limited this to $100k per occurrence (our deductible for non-power gen assets is $1MM). I've also made them take deductibles under their policies for third party liability and employee injury risks (they had these on us originally), and specified that their GL cover include pollution legal liability (they had this on us also, but since it's a third party risk I think it should stay with the operator).
