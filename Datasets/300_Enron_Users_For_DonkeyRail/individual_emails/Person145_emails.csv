"As you know, the Ostrip Functionality has been altered. This change has affected the way the larryoptmodel values the gas daily options. The reason the larryoptmodel is affected is because the larryoptmodel was defining the inputs to the Ostrip model differently than the documentation asked. Let me explain. The Ostrip Model has the following date inputs: NowToSet - Fixed Price = zero - Forward Start = days from now until strike is set BegDays - Fixed Price = days from now until start of option - Forward Start = days from when strike is set until start of option EndDays - Fixed Price = days from now until end of option - Forward Start = days from when strike is set until end of option FwdStFlag - Fixed Price = 0 - Forward Start = 1 The Ostrip model should overlook the NowToSet days if the FwdStFlag = 0 (fixed price option). It assumes the option is set right now. The ""Old Ostrip Model"" did not overlook this input. This is the problem. In Larryoptmodel, the NowToSet is the same for Fixed Price options and Forward Start Options, the BegDays is the same and the EndDays is the same. Thus when the ""Old Ostrip Model"" incorrectly used the NowToSet days, this made the Larryoptmodel value the option correctly. When the ""New Ostrip Model"" was put into production, this model overlooks the NowToSet date, thus giving an incorrect value in Larryoptmodel.

"John: (1) Regarding OptionGrid, Samer can provide you a version that does not write out empty grids to the file by tomorrow. He will then try to increase the max. number of grids from 95 to 320. And we will write the file to a common drive that you can access from Windows, without having to FTP the file from the Unix to the NT drive. I will check with my director (Zhiyong Wei) to see if we can move up the timeline for the OptionGrid running on Windows project. (2) Regarding actual gamma: PriceDelta = Today's Mid. Price - Prior Day's Mid. Price Actual delta = Prior Day's (Option Library) delta * PriceDelta Actual gamma = Prior Days' (Option Library) gamma * 0.5 * (PriceDelta * PriceDelta) (3) Regarding the Asian model, the number of calendar days in a year is 365.25 for the new version using calendar days. We have to merge the new version into the current production PortCalc that has the vol. skew changes. We should have that in a couple of days. I will inform Errol when we are ready for him to start testing. (4) Dave is looking into changing PortCalc to provide 2 actual Vegas - one without skew and one with skew.

"Hello John!! HOw are you ?? How was your Holiday ? Yes, there has been a tremendous ammount of talks about the Industrials asking for subsidies and help from the government to help lower the costs of gas... They were asking for a fixed price of gas @ $3.00, or even $4.00, but the final decision was a loan to finance the cost of gas between IFERC and $4.00, to be paid over a 3 to 4 year plan....I guess the final decision is not so harmful for us because we can still sell the derivatives, and it is a short term decision,,,What is really concerning me is all the noise behind it..The industrials are still pushing for a subsidy or a change in formula and the government is listening, so basically a lot of clients could eventually decide not to hedge in the meantime....Anyway, when do you have sometime to talk about chihuahua ? Let me know what is bets for you....Best regards.

"We should be watching this... -----Original Message----- From: IntercontinentalExchange [mailto:nyadmin@intcx.com] Sent: Thursday, November 15, 2001 11:14 AM To: Zipper, Andy Subject: NEW WEATHER SWAPS ON THE INTERCONTINENTAL EXCHANGE <http://www.intcx.com/weather/images/header7.gif> IntercontinentalExchange is pleased to announce that weather swaps trading will be included in its new version 8 release. These fixed-for-floating financial products will be cash settled on a five-day average temperature, Monday - Friday, for the current week and for the forward week. Temperatures used for the settlement of these products will be those reported by EarthSat, a widely recognized and independent source of weather data. Settlement temperatures provided by EarthSat will be available via the IntercontinentalExchange website. The hub locations for weather trades will be the primary airport weather stations at Chicago-O'Hare, Dallas-Fort Worth, New York-La Guardia, Philadelphia-International and Sacramento-Executive. The standard contract size for all locations will be $10,000 per degree Fahrenheit, with a tic increment of 0.1 degree Fahrenheit or $1,000. There are no payout limits on the contracts. The design and development of these new weather products was done under the guidance of Aquila Energy Marketing Corp., a recognized leader in weather product concepts. In addition, IntercontinentalExchange has worked with Aquila and other major weather market participants, including Reliant Energy, Mirant Americas, and El Paso Merchant Energy, to build consensus and support for these new products.

"John, You are correct, when you compute the historical volatility you need to use 252 days to annualize the volatility. This is because the historical data only existed for trading days. The common practice here at Enron for computing Time to maturity is Calendar Days (= Maturity date - valuation date). Therefore the days in Year is 365.25. So the implied volatility from the EIMPVOL function uses 365.25 days as one year. If you want to convert you can apply the following formula historical vol * sqrt(252) vs. implied vol * sqrt(365.25). Let me know if this helps.

The way I have been calculating historical volatility is that I take the standard deviation of the log returns of the price settles. I then take that number (daily volatility) and multiply by the square root of the number of trading days to come up with an annualized volatility. The number of trading days that I have been using is 252, however I do not know if this is correct. What I am trying to do is calculate a historical volatility that would be comparable to the implied volatility that we are calculating our books with. The implied volatilities are iterated using the euro function.

"John, These are the files that we talked about on our very first meeting some weeks ago. I originally made these for Mario de la Ossa, an options trader on the Crude Products desk. VolSkew.xls takes market data for options with different strikes and premiums and calculates the skew. FetchContract.xls calculates descriptive statistics for contracts based on historic pricing data. Feel free to give me a call if you have any questions about the files. I would be happy to modify them to fit your setup and pricing models. ken ---------------------- Forwarded by Kenneth Parkhill/NA/Enron on 04/10/2001 01:46 PM --------------------------- Kenneth Parkhill 04/10/2001 09:10 AM To: Paulo Issler/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: Subject: vol skew files",kenneth.parkhill@enron.com,john.griffith@enron.com,"'John' : 'person', 'Mario de la Ossa' : 'person', 'Kenneth Parkhill' : 'person', 'Kenneth Parkhill' : 'person', 'Paulo Issler' : 'person'",5,vol skew files,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,received,john.griffith@enron.com

We need to make sure that the volume that is given to Fred (or Vikas or Ross) is only 97% of the VPP firm volumes. Please let myself or Eric Moon know just as soon as you go to Fred's group for a quote so that we may be prepared for the physical side of the deal. Fred, Vikas and Ross: If you go to John Arnold and the basis trader for the quote, we need to let them know that this relates to the Brazos VPP's and that his quote is going to be known by Bank of America. If executed, Bank of America will know that Enron is long and the exact volume and term. They will be taking 3% of the deal at our quote (for accounting reasons, 3% of the hedge on these transactions has to be executed with a counterparty other than Enron, that counterparty is Bank of America).
