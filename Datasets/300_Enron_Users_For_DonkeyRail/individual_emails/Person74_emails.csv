"The attached PDF file summarizes our view (Mary Hain's and mine) of the possible outcomes of taking the PX investigation the FERC route or the PX Settlement route. To make a commercial decision, we need to know what jurisdiction we would like this case to be settled in and the rules of engagement in each jurisdiction. For example, if we do a FERC filing we must meet a ""just and reasonable"" standard while if we appeal an ADR decision to FERC we have to prove that the ADR finding was ""Arbitrary and Capricious."" Please review the attached file and let me know if any of it is wrong. Personally, I need more input from legal and regulatory on what our odds of winning our in the different juridictions before I can make an informed decision.",tim.belden@enron.com,"richard.shapiro@enron.com, mark.haedicke@enron.com,

"IMPORTANT EPMI POLICY REGARDING HARD COPY DOCUMENTS WHILE LITIGATION IS PENDING This policy is in addition to my prior email about the procedure for handling email and electronic documents. While most of what we do is contained within Enron's electronic systems, there still are times when hard copies are made or needed for running our business. Here is how you must handle those hard copy documents: 1. The basic rule is that if you have hard copies of documents that are used in EPMI's business of selling energy in the WSCC, you must keep those documents until further notice. If space becomes a problem, please contact Debra Davidson who can arrange for storage. 2. What constitutes a document? In some instances you will have one copy of a document that has your handwritten notes on it, and another copy that may be clean. For these purposes both are considered documents and both must be saved. Similarly, if several people have copies of the same document, each separate copy is considered a separate document. On the other hand, if you made 10 copies for a meeting and there were 4 left over that were never handed out or were not used, those may be recycled so long as you keep the ones that were used. If you keep handwritten notes for your work, those would be considered documents as well. Telephone notes, charts, printouts of data, spreadsheets etc. all constitute documents.

"Confidential: For Internal Distribution Only The purpose of this e-mail is to bring everyone in the loop on activities on the west desk that we are undertaking to preserve as much value in our book as possible. I realize that our efforts to date have not been communicated to all internal people who need to know what we are doing. My apologies for this. Hopefully this e-mail will accomplish that goal. A number of counterparties in the west have not yet terminated our deals and have benefited from our inability to procure power in the market to serve these deals. As a result, we haven't been delivering on several contracts that are deep in the money. Our counterparties have no motivation to terminate our contracts because such a termination would force them to write us a substantial check. Instead, these counterparties have been happy to not receive high priced power from us and are filling their positions in the market at much lower prices. We have taken the limited supplies that we are still receiving and delivering these limited supplies to the highest price sales contracts that we have. We now have the ability to prepay for additional supplies in order to fulfill additional pre-petition obligations that have not yet been terminated that are in the money. We have received approval from the Cash committee for purchases through December 27th (I think) and we will secure additional cash to continue on. Here are the procedures as I understand them.

"As everyone is surely aware after last night's going away party, John Forney is heading back to Houston to trade the Short Term Entergy market. Bill Williams III will be assuming responsibility for the Real Time desk and will report to Greg Wolfe. There are three major areas of responsibility that Greg and Bill will be focussing on in 2001. The first is the management of EPMI's physical power flows. This entails checking out with counterparties, handling cuts, and ensuring that all of our risk and settlement systems reflect the proper information. The second area is trading done by the Real Time group. Each day, our Real Time desk combs the market looking for attractive trading opportunities. The third area is the Services Desk. The Services Desk provides scheduling and settlements services to customers who don't have the staff or systems to do it themselves. We have seen our Services business grow dramatically this year.

"ENA also sold 100 MW of peak power (6x16) to PG&E for 5 years beginning in January of 2001 delivered in NP15. They declined our offer for flat (7x24) power delivered in NP15 of $50.90/MWh. The trade press is claiming that they purchased 400 MW from Calpine delivered in the new Greater Bay Area zone for around $51/MWh. I believe that these values are lower than the current generation component of PG&E's frozen rates. PG&E procured these MW's through a traditional rfp. This is a pretty clean bilateral deal done outside of the PX. We papered the deal using the EEI master agreement.

"The following summarizes recent price cap events in California. I think that I have most of it right. If there is anything wrong or missing please let me know. Please don't share the attached spreadsheet with anyone outside of Enron. Regards, Tim New Cap Specifics On 10/26/2000 the ISO Board passed a motion by a vote of 13-10 to implement a new price cap methodology. The new methodology will become effective 11/3/2000 or as soon thereafter as can be implemented. CAISO staff has indicated that it will be difficult to achieve that start date. They have not yet indicated what an achievable date might be. The new price cap methodology will remain in place until: Comprehensive market changes have been implemented and the market has proven to be workably competitive under a variety of load conditions. Either FERC or the ISO board orders its removal. Cap prices will be based on the average NYMEX L3D settlement average and the following heat rate table: Load Level Heat Rate 4.00 Gas Example Cap <25 GW 10,775 $43.10 25 GW to 30 GW 14,175 $56.70 30GW to 35 GW 17,225 $68.90 35GW to 40 GW 27,225 $108.90 >40 GW $250/MWh $250/MWh Caps will be rounded up to the nearest $5/MWh increment. Demand bids and demand responsiveness programs are exempt from these caps. The ISO will post the price caps for each load level at least 48 hours prior to the beginning of each calendar month. Based on the ISO's two day-ahead system load forecast, the ISO will post hourly caps at least 24 hours",tim.belden@enron.com,"john.lavorato/corp/enron@enron.com, dave.delainey@enron.com,

"About a month ago I held a meeting in Houston to bring together the systems, operations, and commercial people who were responsible for designing and building our wholesale and retail systems. There were probably twenty people there, including Beth Perlman, Anthony Dayao, Beth Appollo, Bob Hall, Leslie Reeves, Lloyd Will, Todd Busby, Greg Woulfe, Rogers Herndon, Murray O'Neil, Steve Nat, Jeff Richter, Thresa Allen, Pablo ?, Mark Pickering, Dale Furrow, and many more. Two of my suspicions were confirmed in this meeting. First, it was clear that there were a bunch of people working in silos. Beth's group was just starting to talk to Anthony's group. The site profile team wasn't on the same page as Richter who wasn't necessarily in sync with Herndon. EES and ENA (and for that matter east ENA and west ENA) volume management and RTO settlements people weren't talking to one another. Second, it was clear that nobody had tried to map out what all of the necessary functions are and how they should fit together. We tasked Todd Busby, Debra Bailey, and Lloyd Will to spend a month talking to each group and ""drawing the picture"" of all of the systems that were being worked on and how they should fit together.

"The people on the ""To"" list have been selected to attend an ""Energy Math"" training session which will be held on March 7th from 9 AM to 5 PM in the River Room at Two World Trade Center. Amy Fitzpatrick will provide you with a course outline and background reading (helpful but not mandatory) by Monday morning. We want to have 15 people attend this course. I realize that this is short notice, so if you can't attend please let me know ASAP so that I can find a replacement. I have been working with Jon Koomey, who will be teaching the course, over the last couple of months to tailor a training session that will meet the needs of people who work on this floor. The goal is to provide a comprehensive overview of computations and analytical tools that are the foundation of analyzing energy problems. The course is loosely based on a graduate level course offered at Berkeley (which Jon has taught and several people on the floor have taken) and on a book that Jon Koomey recently published. This is the first time that this course, in its current form, is being offered. As a result, it should be viewed as a work in progress. Chris Calger and I would like every person in this office to have the opportunity to take this course between now and the end of the year. We have selected a cross-section of people for this first session. Some people have a lot of experience doing analysis while others have little training in this area. Some have been working in the energy industry for several years while others are new to the business.

"Tim, my understanding is that partnership fee (the $11.0M) has been amortized for the last several years and expensed to the Industrial groups (McConville and Ondarza). As you are aware, I sued them for breach. The settlement involved the elimination of all existing transactions between Ft. James and Enron including the Wauna and Halsey power contracts. It is my understanding that the benefit of the elimination of those shorts resides in the Portland shop. The elimination of the shorts would not have occurred without the lawsuit on the alliance and the settlement I originated. It seemed logical to charge the Portland office with the remaining un-amortized fee of $1.8M as a cost of eliminating the shorts for no cost and no future contingent liability. Lets discuss.

We would expect profit-maximizing traders to have eliminated persistent price differences between the markets. Institutional impediments and traders' incomplete understanding of the markets, however, could have delayed or prevented price convergence. We find that the two benchmark electricity prices in California - the Power Exchange's day-ahead price and the Independent System Operator's real-time price - differed substantially after the markets opened but then appeared to be converging by the beginning of 2000.

"Tim, Here is the email you should send out with respect to retention of hard copies of documents. IMPORTANT EPMI POLICY REGARDING HARD COPY DOCUMENTS WHILE LITIGATION IS PENDING This policy is in addition to my prior email about the procedure for handling email and electronic documents. While most of what we do is contained within Enron's electronic systems, there still are times when hard copies are made or needed for running our business. Here is how you must handle those hard copy documents: 1. The basic rule is that if you have hard copies of documents that are used in EPMI's business of selling energy in the WSCC, you must keep those documents until further notice. If space becomes a problem, please contact _____ who can arrange for storage. 2. What constitutes a document? In some instances you will have one copy of a document that has your handwritten notes on it, and another copy that may be clean. For these purposes both are considered documents and both must be saved. Similarly, if several people have copies of the same document, each separate copy is considered a separate document.

"Here's the solution I came up with. It will only take a few more minutes each day, but I think it will make the EOL summary more relevant. Please let me know if this plan suits you - 1. You will continue to receive the same EnPower/EOL summary, complete with EES sleeves. If I take the EES deals out of this table, I have to adjust the total megawatts accordingly. This could end up taking awhile, and I'm not sure the effect would be worth it. Again, let me know if you agree, because I'd like this report to be as applicable as possible. 2. I will run the EnPower deal count, excluding EES deals. I'll compare this count to the original one to determine how many EES deals were done by each desk, then double that number - to account for both sides of the sleeve - and subtract. I'll enter the altered numbers into the graph, which should produce a more accurate rendering of the day's activities. I think I made it sound more complicated than it is. Bottom line, this should solve the EES sleeve dilemma with little ado.

For example, a $25 million, five-year exposure to a AAA counterparty with standard documentation is contemplated to be approved via this abbreviated approval document. This abbreviated approval document would only be available for transactions meeting these criteria if: (i) structured financing capacity were available, (ii) the funds flow issue created is manageable (both (i) and (ii) as confirmed by EGF), and (iii) the pricing met a threshold that included the structured financing cost, an appropriate credit spread/reserve,",david.delainey@enron.com,tim.belden@enron.com,"'David W Delainey' : 'person', 'David Gorte' : 'person', 'David W Delainey' : 'person', 'Joseph Deffner' : 'person', 'Mark E Haedicke' : 'person', 'Rick Buy' : 'person', 'John J Lavorato' : 'person'",7,Re: Commodity / Embedded Finance Deals,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,received,tim.belden@enron.com
