"Bob, we currently have a total of 16.817 Mmbtu/d nominated for purchases at meter 098-9862 as follows: Spinnaker Exploration Company, L.L.C sit 379424 5,886/d 27% Ranger Oil Company sit 533410 5,886/d 27% The Houston Exploration Company sit 535119 5,045/d 23% It appears that the Texas General Land Office transport volume is not properly included in sitara for May - see deal 535132, which shows 0 as the expectted volume. Texas GLO has historically transported about 23% of the gas at the N. Padre Is. Block 883L. Once it starts flowing, the incremental 10,000 Mmbtu/d should be allocated to the deals mentioned above based on the proportions shown above.
