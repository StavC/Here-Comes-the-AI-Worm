"I saw Kim's response to Stephen Douglas, but it left me short of comfort on a completion timeline or enough details around assurance on an on-going basis that this will be kept up. I sent the note below to Kim. I am sure that she manages well, but I think that we should encourage her to step into full responsibility and to be able to effectively communicate that within the organization. It is likely that when Stephen reads her note, that he will call me and tell me that he still doesn't know when this task will be completed. That was his concern yesterday, and Kim's note really doesn't address that. If she doesn't have an estimated completion date, then she should set a target date for having all of the info compiled and state that at that date she will be able to create a realistic timeline for completing the task. Kim must own and communicate effectively the solutions, or I will be the one that gets the phone calls. The ENA organization must develop confidence in others on our team. Let's help Kim earn that confidence by coaching her to imagine the info that the customers needs (Stephen) and to clearly communicate information that addresses his needs.

"I wanted to give you a quick update on ConfirmLogic.... Testing was done last week on the ConfirmLogic module. On Thursday, we discussed with Kathryn Cordes and the ConfirmLogic IT team the items that we had found that were ""show stoppers"" as far as releasing the product for Beta Testing. Some of the major Items found were the inability to properly handle Basis Swaps for Gas and inability to display meaningful Index References for Power (they were pulling in a code rather than a description of the Index). The team worked on the ""fixes"" and migrated the code last night. Today during testing, they found that the new code had actually caused problems with the fixed price and volume information, which was working previously. I talked to Kathryn and she said that the were rebuilding the code. She said that someone had tested the fix last night and everything worked fine. We plan more testing in the morning. They are doing a high-level demo this Thursday for Beta Customers just to introduce the module. They were planning on having more extensive Beta demos for each client starting next week but realize that those may have to postponed further. We have told them that we would not sign off for Beta testing until we were comfortable that the items that we identified were working. We need consistent, stable days of testing before I will feel comfortable. Overall, we like the ""new"" streamlined version of the screens and feel that it will be a good product if they can work out the data display issues. Call with any questions.

"Leslie, I'm trying to get a jump on making sure we have everything done properly in Enpower for the month of January. My question is whether we, the West desk, should enter any changes in Enpower due to OUR non-delivery and/or incremental deals? We have everything recorded on our Trade sheets, but if it would make it easier for you to settle or relay to the Estate by us making the changes in Deal Scheduling, we can do so. I also understand, after talking to John, you will be using our Trade sheets for such changes for the month of December. I'm not sure who you would like us to assist in translating our sheets, but if you can call me, we can set up a conference call and I'll coordinate from each desk to attend.

"I wanted to give you a quick update on ConfirmLogic.... Testing was done last week on the ConfirmLogic module. On Thursday, we discussed with Kathryn Cordes and the ConfirmLogic IT team the items that we had found that were ""show stoppers"" as far as releasing the product for Beta Testing. Some of the major Items found were the inability to properly handle Basis Swaps for Gas and inability to display meaningful Index References for Power (they were pulling in a code rather than a description of the Index). The team worked on the ""fixes"" and migrated the code last night. Today during testing, they found that the new code had actually caused problems with the fixed price and volume information, which was working previously. I talked to Kathryn and she said that the were rebuilding the code. She said that someone had tested the fix last night and everything worked fine. We plan more testing in the morning. They are doing a high-level demo this Thursday for Beta Customers just to introduce the module. They were planning on having more extensive Beta demos for each client starting next week but realize that those may have to postponed further. We have told them that we would not sign off for Beta testing until we were comfortable that the items that we identified were working. We need consistent, stable days of testing before I will feel comfortable. Overall, we like the ""new"" streamlined version of the screens and feel that it will be a good product if they can work out the data display issues. Call with any questions.

"I saw Kim's response to Stephen Douglas, but it left me short of comfort on a completion timeline or enough details around assurance on an on-going basis that this will be kept up. I sent the note below to Kim. I am sure that she manages well, but I think that we should encourage her to step into full responsibility and to be able to effectively communicate that within the organization. It is likely that when Stephen reads her note, that he will call me and tell me that he still doesn't know when this task will be completed. That was his concern yesterday, and Kim's note really doesn't address that. If she doesn't have an estimated completion date, then she should set a target date for having all of the info compiled and state that at that date she will be able to create a realistic timeline for completing the task.

We store all transactions on the database since inception, in order to facilitate customer transaction searches. This data is the basic buy/sell, commodity, location, volume, price, customer, userid, and time info. In addition for a rolling 45 day period we store the web server info which is much more detailed and has product ID's, session ID's and so forth. At the end of 45 days it is archived and retrievable. when you put these two together you have a very complete picture of what happened to a transaction attempt.

The deal selection is indicated in yellow, and the missing items, in green. Also per your request, attached are the five ""non-standard"" deals for which we have been unable to obtain any information at all. Our primary need is just to get a basic understanding of these transactions.
