"I have returned a call to Gary Gentile from the AP. I gave him this statement and refused further comments on other issues, which included 1) ""what is Enron's actual exposure?"", 2) ""what was Enron's opinion of Gov. Davis' speech last night?"", and 3) ""was this PG&E's only option?"" I did respond to one follow-up question, which was ""what options were available months ago?"" My answer included the following 1) demand side solutions, 2) allowing long-term contracting for power supplies, and 3) expediting the siting process for new supplies.

Eric ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Priggish and piggish in California Mark Steyn National Post A hurricane devastated Tristan da Cunha last month. It swept in May 23, but no one heard about it till the other day because it damaged the island's radio link to the outside world. The storm blew sheep into the chilly South Atlantic, killed many cattle, damaged every single home on the island, demolished the hospital and community centre, blew the roof off the radio station, and wrecked the Albatross, the only pub in the only village, Edinburgh of the Seven Seas. For a week after the storm, the entire island was without electricity. And no one in the rest of the world knew a thing about it! Not the island's colonial masters in London. Not the Governor, who doesn't actually reside there but prefers to live 1,260 miles away on St. Helena, Tristan da Cunha's nearest neighbour. (St. Helena is Manhattan to Tristan's Weehawken, New Jersey.) Plunked in the ocean midway between Argentina and South Africa, Tristan da Cunha is the world's most isolated human settlement. Its contact with the rest of humanity is limited to one annual visit from a British supply vessel, plus the occasional cruise ship, which anchors offshore when it's safe to do so.

"FYI... Energy Cos Limit Business With Enron After 10Q -Traders By Mark Golden 11/20/2001 Dow Jones Energy Service (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Many energy trading companies were unwilling to sell power and natural gas for next day delivery to Enron Corp. (ENE) Tuesday morning, a result of heightened credit concerns following the release of Enron's quarterly financial report Monday, traders and other sources said. For weeks, companies have limited both buying and selling with Enron for future deliveries. But for the first time since Enron's troubles began a month ago, energy companies weren't selling to Enron in the spot markets for fear that Enron might not be able to pay its bills as soon as next month. ""It's pretty well accepted in the industry that people are staying away for now,"" said Charlie Sanchez, energy market manager for Gelber & Associates in Houston. Traders at all of the major companies contacted said they couldn't sell to Enron Tuesday morning. Several spokespeople for energy companies confirmed the situation, but declined to say so on the record. ""Nobody will take Enron,"" one western electricity broker said. After struggling, however, that broker eventually found a utility that was willing to sell to Enron Tuesday morning. Calpine, a prominent independent power producer and trader, said it was willing to sell power to Enron. ""We continue to sell power to Enron and are monitoring the situation closely,"" spokeswoman Catherine Potter said.

"At least some reporters/columnists get it. This is a column from the National Post in Canada. Eric ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Priggish and piggish in California Mark Steyn National Post A hurricane devastated Tristan da Cunha last month. It swept in May 23, but no one heard about it till the other day because it damaged the island's radio link to the outside world. The storm blew sheep into the chilly South Atlantic, killed many cattle, damaged every single home on the island, demolished the hospital and community centre, blew the roof off the radio station, and wrecked the Albatross, the only pub in the only village, Edinburgh of the Seven Seas. For a week after the storm, the entire island was without electricity. And no one in the rest of the world knew a thing about it! Not the island's colonial masters in London. Not the Governor, who doesn't actually reside there but prefers to live 1,260 miles away on St. Helena, Tristan da Cunha's nearest neighbour. (St. Helena is Manhattan to Tristan's Weehawken, New Jersey.) Plunked in the ocean midway between Argentina and South Africa, Tristan da Cunha is the world's most isolated human settlement. Its contact with the rest of humanity is limited to one annual visit from a British supply vessel, plus the occasional cruise ship, which anchors offshore when it's safe to do so. Now that's living off the grid. The East India Company won a charter to settle Trist",eric.thode@enron.com,"mark.frevert@enron.com, greg.whalley@enron.com, john.lavorato@enron.com,

Eric ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Priggish and piggish in California Mark Steyn National Post A hurricane devastated Tristan da Cunha last month. It swept in May 23, but no one heard about it till the other day because it damaged the island's radio link to the outside world. The storm blew sheep into the chilly South Atlantic, killed many cattle, damaged every single home on the island, demolished the hospital and community centre, blew the roof off the radio station, and wrecked the Albatross, the only pub in the only village, Edinburgh of the Seven Seas. For a week after the storm, the entire island was without electricity. And no one in the rest of the world knew a thing about it! Not the island's colonial masters in London. Not the Governor, who doesn't actually reside there but prefers to live 1,260 miles away on St. Helena, Tristan da Cunha's nearest neighbour. (St. Helena is Manhattan to Tristan's Weehawken, New Jersey.) Plunked in the ocean midway between Argentina and South Africa, Tristan da Cunha is the world's most isolated human settlement. Its contact with the rest of humanity is limited to one annual visit from a British supply vessel, plus the occasional cruise ship, which anchors offshore when it's safe to do so. Now that's living off the grid. The East India Company won a charter to settle Trist",eric.thode@enron.com,"mark.frevert@enron.com, greg.whalley@enron.com, john.lavorato@enron.com,

It can (1) buy more power (under its DOE granted Section 202(c) authority), (2) cut scheduled power transactions, or (3) derate transmission capacity used to export power from its system. The Cal ISO has recently been derating to zero transmission capacity to the Northwest (option 3). Because transmission users can't get capacity to sell their power outside California, the effect is that the ISO gets cheaper power over customers in the NW. I was thinking of a political approach to solving this problem. I was wondering if you could work with your contacts to mobilize NW Senators (?) to write a letter to the California ISO and the Governor; you might even get Steve Wright to sign on given that this situation must make it more difficult for him to balance his budget. The central theme of the letter would point out what a hue and cry there would be if BPA engaged in such actions and that California is simply trying to get cheaper power than the rest of the region. It could also point out that the Cal ISO already has the mechanism of the Secretary of Energy's Section 202(c) orders",mary.hain@enron.com,eric.thode@enron.com,"'Mary Hain' : 'person', 'Mary Hain' : 'person', 'craiggannett@dwt.com' : 'email', 'James D Steffes' : 'person', 'csandhe@enron.com' : 'email', 'Sean Crandall' : 'person', 'Tim Belden' : 'person', 'Steve Wright' : 'person'",8,COB Exports denied,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,received,eric.thode@enron.com
