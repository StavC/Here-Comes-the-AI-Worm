"John- As you no doubt have heard, Enron is going through extremely difficult times presently. I myself had another sinus surgery 3 weeks ago and they inserted a sub-clavian catheter in order to feed intraveneous antibiotics twice daily for six weeks to aggressively treat the infections in my sinuses. My father passed away on 11-17 and I have been out of the office for the last 3 weeks. I am back now on a part time basis and spoke with Kevin Hyatt today about the status of Sun Devil. If the project goes forward, it will be financed differently than we originally intended. We have submitted proposals to a couple key parties and would like to move forward with one for Energy Development soon. We are asking for firm commitments by the end of this year for a 30 year term. We are at a critical stage with Sun Devil at this time. In order to move forward and spend the necessary $9 million on the EIS we need firm commitments.

"As you know, 33,000/d at La Maquina does not equate to 33,000/d at either the Arkansas Loop Plant or the new receipt point with Red Cedar in the La Plata station yard. (According to Ron, it's a matter of physics!!) Anyway, Red Cedar will be using the new receipt point on an alternate basis, so to the extent gas is not coming in at La Maquina, they'll be able to flow some amount of incremental through the new point. If we sell 33,000/d primary firm out of La Maquina, it would back off the alternate gas at the new Red Cedar point. My opinion is that if we can find a party to buy the 33,000/d from La Maquina - go ahead and do it because we've never made a representation to Red Cedar that the new point capacity is associated with any line capacity.

"Duke does plan to build a merchant plant in Curry County, NM. They think it will be a 2-stage project with each stage 600 megawatts. The proposed in-service date of the 1st phase is 2Q04. They will need a minimum pipeline pressure off TW of 500 psi. Perry Frazier and I have met with Duke reps as recently as Jan. 02 about this plant. A draft interconnect agreement has been forwarded to Duke who is working on providing their comments to TW.

The only restriction is that we need to always offer cost-based recourse rate service as an alternative to negotiated rates.

Rate impact on TW customers; method by which TW would collect the costs of the acquired capacity. - I assume TW would be at risk for any undercollection of revenue associated with the PNM capacity; thus there is no cost-shift potential to other shippers. - Net costs will be separately recorded. 2. Would acquisition of PNM capacity enable TW to gain control over access to upstream capacity and supply sources in a manner which would permit TW to limit customer choices or improperly tie use of the acquired capacity to other pipeline services? (I think Mary Kay will be able to help us explain the ""no tying"" part). 3. Would TW's marketing affiliates receive preferential treatment? - No TW marketing affiliate will be involved in the proposed transaction - Acquisition of PNM capacity will not result in any undue preference or advantage to any affiliated entity. 4. Will TW as a holder of capacity receive preferential treatment over PNM's customers, to the detriment of PNM's customers? - No. PNM will be making the capacity available to TW only during periods in which it has unused capacity available on its system, so any impact on PNM shippers should be minimal. - Service contract under PNM's tariff does not provide for unduly preferential treatment of",susan.scott@enron.com,lorraine.lindberg@enron.com,"'Lorraine' : 'person', 'Mary Kay' : 'person'",2,Acquisition of PNM capacity,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,received,lorraine.lindberg@enron.com
"Great--looks like a good start at working through this project. I've got a couple of thoughts, questions, etc. that I'd like to discuss with you all before we get back to Tino with any kind of preliminary response: 1. What is our pulse on a project that ramps up slowly to full utilization? This deal will not be 100% subscribed for several years (optimistically) as it is designed to gain market share from a combination of market growth and bypass of existing GCNM customers (and new power generation load, but that part of Tino's story needs more thinking). The rates on the attached spreadsheet would provide full cost recovery only after the project is fully subscribed, right? We need to think about the economics of this thing in terms of deferring and recovering in the out years the revenue shortfalls in the early years. Has GPG ever done deals like that? 2. On the GCNM discounting issue, it seems we need at least three data points to understand our risks: a. What do GCNM's current discounts look like? b. How much more aggressively could GCNM discount in the future if they had to to avoid bypass? (i.e., are there regulatory or political constraints on increased discounts?) c. Will the big industrial loads stick with the low cost provider if GCNM tries to undercut the project, or will they be willing to pay a little more just to assure that a new pipeline gets built into their backyard? 3.

"Lorraine, I have no problem with Larry's proposed change or his reasons for the change. However, I would ask that we eliminate the word ""volumetric"" as that has other connotations in the FERC tariff world. I.e., if we were truly to have ""volumetric"" rates (like Northern) we'd have to file a whole new rate schedule! I just don't want to use this word. I don't think it's necessary in order to convey Larry's meaning. Why don't we insert: ""on a daily basis only to the volumes for which such other alternate points are utilized"".

"When the Commission granted Texas Eastern authority to hold capacity on another pipeline in Texas Eastern Transmission Corporation, 74 FERC P 61,074 (1996), it stated that when a pipeline holds capacity on an upstream pipeline, the downstream pipeline's customers may hold title to the gas transported on the upstream pipeline. The Commission recognized this as one of the limited exceptions to the shipper must have title rule. Specifically, the Commission stated: The downstream pipeline will not hold title to gas shipped on capacity it has acquired on an upstream pipeline. Rather, shippers on the downstream pipeline will hold title to the gas on the upstream pipeline. We will allow a pipeline to hold the upstream capacity; we will not, however, allow the pipeline to hold title to the gas being shipped. Thus, the downstream pipeline will be the shipper on the upstream pipeline, but will not hold title when the gas is being shipped. This results in a limited exception to the rule that a shipper must hold title to gas being shipped. I believe that if we can address the Commission's other concerns about this filing, they will grant a similar waiver for this transaction.

"Lorraine, here are a few notes from my review of the Val Verde contract, and my initial impressions. Let's talk more about how to approach the issue after we meet with Ron tomorrow about MAOP. 12/31/92 Interconnect Agreement: Sec. 1.3 specifies pressures and states that unless there is an agreement to provide firm compression service TW will accept up to 200,000 on an interruptible basis. Sec. 2 states that the Blanco Hub MAOP shall not be exceeded. Sec. 4.2 limits damages (no consequential damages). The contract also has a fairly standard force majeure clause. 2/18/93 letter amendment: Sec. 3 obligates TW to provide firm compression service in order to accept 200,000 into TW's system (provided MOGI has pressure of at least 650 and quantity of at least 140). Acknowledges that this is an agreement to provide firm compression in accordance with Sec. 1.3 of 12/92 agreement. 9/25/95 letter amendment: Increases quantity to be received at the interconnect to 250,000 once the San Juan expansion is effective. My initial conclusions: It is pretty clear we have an obligation to accept 250,000 on a firm basis, provided that Burlington complies with the pressure requirements. Probably the only way we can avoid this obligation is if accepting 250,000 would cause us to exceed the hub MAOP. In that case we can argue impossibility of performance. Also, we could avoid the obligation because the summer heat above certain temperatures constitutes force majeure. This argument is strengthened by the fact that temperatures seem to have gotten hotter over the years",susan.scott@enron.com,lorraine.lindberg@enron.com,"'Lorraine' : 'person', 'Ron' : 'person'",2,"Burlington: PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL ATTORNEY-CLIENT

"Great--looks like a good start at working through this project. I've got a couple of thoughts, questions, etc. that I'd like to discuss with you all before we get back to Tino with any kind of preliminary response: 1. What is our pulse on a project that ramps up slowly to full utilization? This deal will not be 100% subscribed for several years (optimistically) as it is designed to gain market share from a combination of market growth and bypass of existing GCNM customers (and new power generation load, but that part of Tino's story needs more thinking). The rates on the attached spreadsheet would provide full cost recovery only after the project is fully subscribed, right? We need to think about the economics of this thing in terms of deferring and recovering in the out years the revenue shortfalls in the early years. Has GPG ever done deals like that? 2. On the GCNM discounting issue, it seems we need at least three data points to understand our risks: a. What do GCNM's current discounts look like? b. How much more aggressively could GCNM discount in the future if they had to to avoid bypass? (i.e., are there regulatory or political constraints on increased discounts?) c. Will the big industrial loads stick with the low cost provider if GCNM tries to undercut the project, or will they be willing to pay a little more just to assure that a new pipeline gets built into their backyard? 3.

"When the Commission granted Texas Eastern authority to hold capacity on another pipeline in Texas Eastern Transmission Corporation, 74 FERC P 61,074 (1996), it stated that when a pipeline holds capacity on an upstream pipeline, the downstream pipeline's customers may hold title to the gas transported on the upstream pipeline. The Commission recognized this as one of the limited exceptions to the shipper must have title rule. Specifically, the Commission stated: The downstream pipeline will not hold title to gas shipped on capacity it has acquired on an upstream pipeline. Rather, shippers on the downstream pipeline will hold title to the gas on the upstream pipeline. We will allow a pipeline to hold the upstream capacity; we will not, however, allow the pipeline to hold title to the gas being shipped. Thus, the downstream pipeline will be the shipper on the upstream pipeline, but will not hold title when the gas is being shipped. This results in a limited exception to the rule that a shipper must hold title to gas being shipped. I believe that if we can address the Commission's other concerns about this filing, they will grant a similar waiver for this transaction.

"Great--looks like a good start at working through this project. I've got a couple of thoughts, questions, etc. that I'd like to discuss with you all before we get back to Tino with any kind of preliminary response: 1. What is our pulse on a project that ramps up slowly to full utilization? This deal will not be 100% subscribed for several years (optimistically) as it is designed to gain market share from a combination of market growth and bypass of existing GCNM customers (and new power generation load, but that part of Tino's story needs more thinking). The rates on the attached spreadsheet would provide full cost recovery only after the project is fully subscribed, right? We need to think about the economics of this thing in terms of deferring and recovering in the out years the revenue shortfalls in the early years. Has GPG ever done deals like that? 2. On the GCNM discounting issue, it seems we need at least three data points to understand our risks: a. What do GCNM's current discounts look like? b. How much more aggressively could GCNM discount in the future if they had to to avoid bypass? (i.e., are there regulatory or political constraints on increased discounts?) c. Will the big industrial loads stick with the low cost provider if GCNM tries to undercut the project, or will they be willing to pay a little more just to assure that a new pipeline gets built into their backyard? 3.

"I sympathize with your desire to obtain incremental revenues, but I think PNM's representation to its own system shippers might have made that task more difficult. I fielded a call from Carla Johnson with Conoco indicating that in its recent open season for this capacity, PNM told parties that it wasn't really relevant whether a shipper had primary firm take away on TW from the point, what really mattered is whether the shipper had firm on PNM in order to get it there. This issue surfaced when I told Carla that all of the firm takeaway (receipt point) capacity had already been taken. The point here is that we might have shippers (successfully) using alt. receipt rights under existing contracts at discounted rates to receive firm gas off PNM. If PNM controls the upstream capacity, then (effectively) they dictate the downstream parties' rights. This poses little to no risk to East - East shippers, more risk of getting cut to the East - West shippers.
