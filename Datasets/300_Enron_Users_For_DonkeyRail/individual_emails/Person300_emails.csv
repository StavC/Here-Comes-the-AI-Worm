Susan Fernandez 12/10/99 01:38 PM To: Louis Soldano/ET&S/Enron@ENRON cc: William Kendrick/OTS/Enron@ENRON Subject: PCB Decontamination of Turbine Lou - Under the PCB Mega rule, self-implementing decontamination of PCBs (i.e., cleanup without verification sampling) is only available for PCB containers; movable equipment used in storage areas, tools and sampling equipment; non porous surfaces contaminated with mineral oil dielectric fluid; and air compressor systems. 40 CFR 761.79(c). EPA has yet to provide written guidance on its PCB Mega Rule decontamination regulations. Based on my reading of the regulations, a contaminated turbine must be decontaminated in accordance with the measurement-based decontamination methods. The measurement-based decontamination procedures are not prescriptive. The simply require that the non porous surface be cleaned by a method that reduces the surface concentration to less than or equal to 10 micrograms PCBs per 100 square centimeters if the equipment is decontaminated for unrestricted use or less than 100 micrograms PCBs per 100 square centimeters if the material is to be disposed of in an industrial smelter after decontamination. 40 CFR 761.79(b).

"Privileged & Confidential Attorney - Client Communication I just spoke with Mr. Charles de Saillan, Asst. General Counsel for the NMED, concerning the referenced Compliance Order. Apparently the NMED mailed out 60 of these orders last week. The NM legislature has adopted a statute of limitations under the NM Air Quality Act and the NMED was acting to attempt to foreclose the use of this defense. (Dave - can Mary hunt this new legislation down??). The language in the order assessing a $15,000 penalty per day of violation is standard language when the NMED has not assessed a specific figure. It will be a couple of weeks before the NMED will be able to provide us a specific penalty. We discussed settlement and the administrative hearing process. A settlement meeting is not likely to take place soon due to the NMED's workload. We need to have a number from the NMED before the settlement conference anyway. We will have to file the request to go to hearing no later tahn July 18th. However, Charlie stated that if the respondent evidenced good faith to achieve as settlement the Secretary had the discretion to allow additional time to submit a full answer (where we provided all of the details of our defense.) I told Charlie we would be organizing ourselves internally and that we would get back to him with some proposed dates for a settlement conference, a request for hearing and a request to extend the time in which to file an answer - preferably tied to after the settlement conference",louis.soldano@enron.com,"david.nutt@enron.com, larry.campbell@enron.com, john.shafer@enron.com,

"Gentlemen - The revised counter was delivered to Zaman earlier today. McGee spoke with Zaman and later with both Trujillo and Zaman. They delivered what they stated, and McGee believes, is their final and bottom line proposal. They would not consider Standing Rock as part of this negotiation (although they would be open to separate negotiation over Standing Rock), they required $15 million up front and $2.34 million per year with a CPI escalator.

Scott Sent: Tue 8/28/2001 5:14 PM To: lsoldano@enron.com; Melton, Richard Cc: Shafer, John; Jensen, Ruth Subject: NMED Compliance Order ** Proprietary ** Lou, I attach a draft of a chronology of events concerning the P-1 compressor station matter. I have tried to keep the chronology as short as possible. I have not included in this draft the dates that Transwestern applied for and received two modifications to the permit for the P-1. Transwestern applied for the first modification on July 26, 1996 to convert the P-1 from a regenerative cycle to a simple cycle and to include a 126 HP stand by generator. That permit modification was issued on February 21, 1997. Transwestern applied for the second modification on January 6, 1997. That application sought an increase in the horsepower of the facility from 2500 to approximately 3700 horsepower. NMED issued that amendment on September 8, 1997. On the one hand , the fact that NMED issued the modifications is good for us because it shows that Transwestern properly and timely applied for modifications when it understood such action to be required and because it arguably shows that NMED did not see the May 1996 issue as being significant enough to prevent their issuing modifications to that permit. Including all of that material in the chronology, however, may 'muddy the waters"" and may make the chronology less powerful. Let me know if you think we should include those events.

"Larry - I've received a copy of the compliance order. It assesses a penalty of $15,000 per day for each day of violation (May 1996 to September 8, 1997 or 496 days). This results in a fine of $7.44 million. I hope the order has a typo and the NMED meant a penalty of ""up to"" $15,000 per day of violation. If this is not a typo I see no downside to asking for a hearing and a settlement conference. We may do so anyway.

"PRIVILEGED & CONFIDENTIAL Please see the request that was made by the Navajo EPA to Larry Campbell (one of our New Mexico Division Environmental Specialists) below.

Dave Johnson and John Shafer have advised the lads to funnel this request and similar requests through our p/l safety group, legal and the VP of Operations and be extermely careful in our responses. However, this request presents its own special issues. I'll speak to John Gormley and ask him to say simply that he will pass the request along.

Crawar Remediation Lou, In advance of installing several off-site wells for a remediation system at the N. Crawar site, Roger Westbrook has contacted the property owner in order to obtain off-site access for the installation of wells and other associated activities. I believe Roger offered $2500 for a five year term. The property owner has indicated that Duke Energy (the current facility owner) has indicated that Duke plans to release the property lease since they no longer utilize this facility. Furthermore, the property owner has put off entering into an access agreement with TW pending further information regarding Duke's plans for the lease. Roger suspects that the property owner wants more for damages to replace the lost revenue that was generated by the lease. This brings up the following questions.

"Mike - I'd suggest we move on any decon work for our facilities at the same time..... The find of PCBs in the compressors will undoubtedly be the subject of next week's meeting. The presence of PCBs does not limit their use at that station. PG&E would be reluctant to move the engines around on the system. Depending upon the concentrations at the time, they may be restricted in their ability to sell or reuse the compressors. I'm not aware of any true decon process for such equipment. Vector may be able to propose a piecemeal decon project but it would likely be expensive and involve the outage of the equipment for a significant period of time.

"Privileged & Confidential Attorney - Client Communication I just spoke with Mr. Charles de Saillan, Asst. General Counsel for the NMED, concerning the referenced Compliance Order.

The NM legislature has adopted a statute of limitations under the NM Air Quality Act and the NMED was acting to attempt to foreclose the use of this defense. (Dave - can Mary hunt this new legislation down??). The language in the order assessing a $15,000 penalty per day of violation is standard language when the NMED has not assessed a specific figure. It will be a couple of weeks before the NMED will be able to provide us a specific penalty. We discussed settlement and the administrative hearing process. A settlement meeting is not likely to take place soon due to the NMED's workload. We need to have a number from the NMED before the settlement conference anyway. We will have to file the request to go to hearing no later tahn July 18th. However, Charlie stated that if the respondent evidenced good faith to achieve as settlement the Secretary had the discretion to allow additional time to submit a full answer (where we provided all of the details of our defense.)

We will need unrestricted access 24 hrs/day, 7 days/week to monitor and service the remediation system and monitor wells. 3. The electric power drop for the remediation equipment is separate from the facility so this shouldn't be a problem. 4. The remediation system does not utilize compressed air or natural gas from the facility so this shouldn't be a problem. 5.

"Lou- Here are some suggestions: 1. Exclude the remediation system equipment: 350 bbl AST and equipment building with air compressor. 2. We will need unrestricted access 24 hrs/day, 7 days/week to monitor and service the remediation system and monitor wells. 3. The electric power drop for the remediation equipment is separate from the facility so this shouldn't be a problem. 4. The remediation system does not utilize compressed air or natural gas from the facility so this shouldn't be a problem. 5. Reserve the right to deed record the location of contaminated soil and groundwater. 6. Reserve the right to construct additional wells and/or facilities to faciliate remediation efforts. 7.

These regulations apply to almost each mainline C/S in New Mexico, Arizona and California (initiating at Station 9, Roswell to Needles and including the tanks on the Topock Lateral). There are eighteen condensate tanks on the Transwestern mainline system which could potentially be impacted, however, only about 10 tanks have received hazardous waste liquids in the last 3-4 years. The constituents which make these tanks fall under Subtitle C of RCRA is the arsenic, lead and low flashpoint (VOC's) of the condensate. PCB's are another issue and are subject to other requirements. Briefly, the liquids which collect into the tanks",john.shafer@enron.com,louis.soldano@enron.com,"'John Shafer' : 'person', 'John Shafer' : 'person', 'Larry Campbell' : 'person', 'Rich Jolly' : 'person', 'Michel Nelson' : 'person', 'Louis Soldano' : 'person', 'John Shafer' : 'person', 'William Kendrick' : 'person', 'Rick Cates' : 'person', 'Butch Russell' : 'person', 'Station 9, Roswell to Needles' : 'address'",11,"Compliance with the Large Quantity Generator Requirements,

"Lou- I think the previous numbers are a bit low now. In December, 1999, we installed four downgradient monitor wells on off-site property owned by the Nature Conservancy. Samples from these wells confirm a contaminant plume of arsenic in the shallow groundwater emanating from the release area. Another development is the recent accumulation of product in some of our recovery wells that is different in characteristic from what we were previously dealing with. This indicates that we are possibly pulling in product from another source that we have not yet identified (although I suspect a nearby sump location as the culprit). We have another drilling program in the works for this year to further delineate the downgradient extent of the arsenic plume and to evaluate the other potential source of accumulated product. This work is tentatively scheduled for the latter part of August or September. Please let me know if this schedule should be accelerated or deferred due to a pending sale agreement. Another consideration related to off-site contamination, the Railroad Commission has not yet requested that NNG notify affected property owners, but I suspect that such a request is forthcoming. I am in the process of preparing a letter, addressed to you, identifying the affected property located between the facility and the Nature Conservancy property. In light of these considerations and the continued interest by the Railroad Commission, I have adjusted the spending forecast as follows: 2000 $100k 2001 $100k 2002 $60k 2003 $20k 2004 $20k 2005+ $20k Total $320,000+ Notes regard",george.robinson@enron.com,louis.soldano@enron.com,'Lou' : 'person',1,Re: Gomez PSA,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,received,louis.soldano@enron.com
