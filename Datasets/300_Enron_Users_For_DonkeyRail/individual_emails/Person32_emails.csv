"CDWR is proposing to all potential suppliers the following security package for new PPA's: 1) Irrevocable PUC Order / Agreement that ""locks in the revenue stream"" for CDWR to cover the PPA costs. 2) PPA covenant that the power supplier has payment priority over any debt, including the contemplated debt issue - the concept is that the supply is the operating cost and any debt would be subordinate 3) PPA Covenant that their is a uniform package to all suppliers; no more favorable terms or priority to ayone, no L/C, etc. Subject to definitive language, CDWR is trying to get people to buy into this general plan. What do people think? Please try to shoot holes in this. Please forward to the appropriate legal, regulatory and credit folks to air this out.

In effect, ""core"" customers (rez and small business) would be served by the utilities' retained generating assets and QF contracts; and large customers would go to market.

"I am comfortable with the Allegheny credit - my understanding is that they are getting a sweetheart deal on the assets being transferred from their regulated utility so they will be in a buying mode for quite some time - in fact they are a good candidate for buying this but I did not want to disrupt the negotiations by bringing up the equity sale. Regarding Turbopark, this project on its own could go into Turbopark (we are using their form of EPC), but because this is linked to a Fair Market Value QF, accounting is not comfortable using it (it risks our favourable Arthur Anderson treatment on all of our FMV assets) We have assumed in our economics that the bridge loan is priced at 15%.

They are working on an agreement with CPUC that would ensure that CDWR would have an adequate revenue stream to support the contracts. Their intent is to make the supply contracts have priority over the bonds. Until that happens, we maintain that we require a cash prepayment or letter of credit to support any deal.

The negotiations were convened by the Speaker of the Assembly (Bob Hertzberg). When Hertzberg convened the meeting, he told the parties that he wanted to achieve a core/noncore structure, similar to the structure in place in California's gas market (i.e., large customers are required to buy gas from the market, with Direct Access available to all other customers). In effect, ""core"" customers (rez and small business) would be served by the utilities' retained generating assets and QF contracts; and large customers would go to market.

"Antelope is a project that we acquired last year from AES. The project has land, some early permits, and a transmission queue position that we used at Pastoria. Total consideration paid to AES was approximately $15MM, most of which was charged to Pastoria. The resulting cost basis should be about $1.8MM plus the ERC's not used at Pastoria (approx. $6MM). Over the next 4 months we will determine whether we want to pursue the project or, if not, write off the $1.8MM and sell/transfer the ERC's for a gain of $1.8MM+.

"Louise, I spoke to Chip and he mentioned your concern/question about the financing of this project. To be clear, the turbines and some of the equipment are in Turbopark. However, Global Finance does not want to construct this project inside of Turbopark because Accounting believes that would be problematic for our fair market value treatment of our merchant investments. Global Finance's plan is to provide a JEDI II/ENA bridge loan to the project for the non-turbine construction costs through a bridge loan from May 1 through Sep 30. The expected loan amount during this time period is $30MM, split between ENA and JEDI II. Our economics assume the bridge loan is priced at 15%. Global Finance has committed to arrange non-recourse project financing so that ENA/JEDI will have only a $40MM combined investment once the financing closes by Sep 30. Also during this time period we will be actively marketing the project with the intent to divest of it fully prior to Sep 30. Hopefully that clarifies things.

Sempra is a more attractive candidate for an outsourcing given its structure and incentives.

"The spreadsheet below gives the implicit commodity based on the effective date of four different rates for the same rate schedule (Schedule DR). The rate schedule effective August 2000 through September 2000 yields a much larger commodity charge because SDG&E customers will receive a lump sum reimbursement from SDG&E over those two months. SDG&E customers will expect lower electric bills. Assuming that the lump sum reimbursement is not included in the implicit energy component, the average for June 2000 through January 2001 is 6.2 cts and the implicit commodity average from February 2001 through December 2001 is 7.3 cts. The average implicit commodity from June 2000 through December 2001 is 6.9 cts For deliveries starting September 1, 2000, the average would still be 6.9 cts. Assuming that the lump sum reimbursement is included in the implicit energy component, the average for June 2000 through January 2001 is 7.4 cts and the implicit commodity average from February 2001 through December 2001 is 7.3 cts. The average implicit commodity from June 2000 through December 2001 is 7.3 cts For deliveries starting September 1, 2000, the average would be 7.2 cts. Clarification: The caps apply the first 500 kWh consumed by all residential customers. For those who consume more than 500 kWh per month, the market rates will only apply for all consumption above 500 kWh. ---------------------- Forwarded by Bruno Gaillard/SFO/EES on 08/23/2000 02:55 PM --------------------------- Bruno Gaillard 08/23/2000 02:33 PM To: Christopher F Calger/PDX/ECT@ECT cc: Roger Yang/SFO",bruno.gaillard@enron.com,christopher.calger@enron.com,"'Bruno Gaillard' : 'person', 'Bruno Gaillard' : 'person', 'Christopher F Calger' : 'person', 'Roger Yang' : 'person'",4,Energy prices embedded in the Duque Interim Bill Cap,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,received,christopher.calger@enron.com

This thirty day period coincides with the expected financial close of June 15 so it may just be posturing to let us know that they are not committed until the deal actually closes. Nevertheless, we (Avista and Enron) will pursue fallback investors that have already seen the project and previously expressed interest in a 50% share.
