"Plan is to pull Accounting, RAC, IT, Back Office, HR, Research, EES, EEL, EBS, etc., names today. I was assuming you could just give me EA names minus ENW, Colwell, HR, and accounting, which I would get from functional leads. I've told most people this may be roughly 10% but in some case it should be 0% others maybe deeper (maybe up to 20%). We can go over list this evening and make changes. Remember logic is: People we need to help us through bankruptcy People who are critical to core business which would otherwise hamper our ability to sell/operate People who could easily get other jobs People who are critical to keeping lights on People with critical knowledge on deals/transaction we need to manage or unwind in next 2/3 months.

Currently, the deal makers are not aware of who to contact within HR when they are working on deals. An example is today I received a call from Findley Biggerstaff explaining that he is working on a pulp mill deal in British Columbia. This is a unionized facility with approximately 400 employees. Given that this is a unionized facility, we need to have time to review contracts and identify any and all risk of acquiring such a facility. The aggressive timeline for this deal is December 15, 2000 and they are actually working on the 2nd round bidding process. So with that, my first thought is that we need to get our names out there to be pulled in on the front end. We actually have a couple of different boiler plate templates that I work with when participating on any due diligence team. I work close with Michelle Cash (legal matters), Dee Lenfest (domestic benefit matters), Rich Johnson (labor relations) and Tim Callahan (international benefits).

"Dear All Further to the PRC Committee Meeting please find attached the first draft of the peer group mapping by function. It was decided that each member would review the proposal to move from 4 peer groups to 3 for Mid Year. The attached was completed some weeks ago by the HR leads in your business Unit and is based on a McKinsey study requested by Jeff Skilling and Steve Kean. Under your review of the attached information, please focus on the final two pages that show the 'strawman' on how the functions fell out under the proposed peer group structure. I have copied in the HR leads for your business area. They have been instrumental in completing the mapping and will meet with you to provide any specific information you require concerning placements with your business area. I would point out that there does appear to be some inconsistencies in function placements within the peer groups for some business units; it will be our primary focus at the next meeting to resolves these issues.

Human Resources and Communications are preparing a thorough Q&A, which we will send to you tomorrow and will regularly update as more information is available. Meanwhile, please read the announcement below from Security about how you can obtain a new UBS Warburg access card that will allow you to enter our new office space after Friday. I am confident that you share my enthusiasm about our new opportunity. We look forward to working along side each of you in the coming days. David Oxley Head, Human Resources ____________________________________________________________________ Access Cards There will be a two-day transition for the new UBS Warburg access cards. Beginning Monday, February 11, access to the 5th and 6th floors of Enron Center South will require these new cards. UBS Warburg access cards can be picked up from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. at the reception area on the 5th floor of Enron Center South on Thursday, February 7th ; Friday, February 8th ; and Monday, February 11. Enron Security will produce new access cards with existing photographs, then simultaneously issue the new and collect the old cards. Employees without UBS Warburg cards will be allowed into the Enron Center South building on Monday but will have to collect their new cards as soon as possible to gain access to the 5th and 6th floors.

In recognising that this may seem like an additional burden over and above the various PRC discussion we have already committed to, I would encourage you to avoid spending any significant time in preparing for this discussion, aside from ensuring you have a complete picture of all your commercial VP's and MD's and then listing them down quickly as above.

"Dear All Further to the PRC Committee Meeting please find attached the first draft of the peer group mapping by function. It was decided that each member would review the proposal to move from 4 peer groups to 3 for Mid Year. The attached was completed some weeks ago by the HR leads in your business Unit and is based on a McKinsey study requested by Jeff Skilling and Steve Kean. Under your review of the attached information, please focus on the final two pages that show the 'strawman' on how the functions fell out under the proposed peer group structure. I have copied in the HR leads for your business area. They have been instrumental in completing the mapping and will meet with you to provide any specific information you require concerning placements with your business area. I would point out that there does appear to be some inconsistencies in function placements within the peer groups for some business units; it will be our primary focus at the next meeting to resolves these issues. Your assistants have been contacted regarding the time and date of our next meeting under separate cover. For our London colleagues we will aim for a morning meeting.

"Ken, This gentleman joined Enron Europe following our acquisition of MG PLC in early 2000. While I think it prudent for us to conduct an independent review (I have asked a member of Cindy's ER team to take a look at this), it does appear to me on first pass that he is essentially unhappy that we are not prepared to pay him 2 years pay in the event he voluntarily terminates his employment with us. Just for clarity, I do not believe he is being asked to leave the company. In fact, as I understand it, his extended illness prevents him from being focused on as a redundancy target. In addition, he along with several other Enron Metals employees do have more generous contractual notice periods in their UK employment agreements that do trigger a significantly higher sum in the event of termination than most of our UK employees (up to a years pay). I will update you further when I have more information.

Currently, the deal makers are not aware of who to contact within HR when they are working on deals. An example is today I received a call from Findley Biggerstaff explaining that he is working on a pulp mill deal in British Columbia. This is a unionized facility with approximately 400 employees. Given that this is a unionized facility, we need to have time to review contracts and identify any and all risk of acquiring such a facility. The aggressive timeline for this deal is December 15, 2000 and they are actually working on the 2nd round bidding process. So with that, my first thought is that we need to get our names out there to be pulled in on the front end. We actually have a couple of different boiler plate templates that I work with when participating on any due diligence team. I work close with Michelle Cash (legal matters), Dee Lenfest (domestic benefit matters), Rich Johnson (labor relations) and Tim Callahan (international benefits). The majority of the acquisitions will be merchant assets in which we will not integrate into Enron businesses, but we need time to determine how ",david.oxley@enron.com,kathy.neal@enron.com,"'Tim O' : 'person', 'Sheil K' : 'person', 'Mich C' : 'person', 'Cynthia B' : 'person', 'Mary J' : 'person', 'David Kathy Neal' : 'person', 'David Oxley' : 'person', 'Findley Biggerstaff' : 'person', 'Michelle Cash' : 'person', 'Dee Lenfest' : 'person', 'Rich Johnson' : 'person', 'Tim Callahan' : 'person'",12,Re: M&A - Post-Acquisition Culture Management,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,sent,david.oxley@enron.com

Meanwhile, please read the announcement below from Security about how you can obtain a new UBS Warburg access card that will allow you to enter our new office space after Friday. I am confident that you share my enthusiasm about our new opportunity. We look forward to working along side each of you in the coming days. David Oxley Head, Human Resources ____________________________________________________________________ Access Cards There will be a two-day transition for the new UBS Warburg access cards. Beginning Monday, February 11, access to the 5th and 6th floors of Enron Center South will require these new cards. UBS Warburg access cards can be picked up from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. at the reception area on the 5th floor of Enron Center South on Thursday, February 7th ; Friday, February 8th ; and Monday, February 11.

The attached was completed some weeks ago by the HR leads in your business Unit and is based on a McKinsey study requested by Jeff Skilling and Steve Kean. Under your review of the attached information, please focus on the final two pages that show the 'strawman' on how the functions fell out under the proposed peer group structure. I have copied in the HR leads for your business area. They have been instrumental in completing the mapping and will meet with you to provide any specific information you require concerning placements with your business area. I would point out that there does appear to be some inconsistencies in function placements within the peer groups for some business units; it will be our primary focus at the next meeting to resolves these issues. Your assistants have been contacted regarding the time and date of our next meeting under separate cover. For our London colleagues we will aim for a morning meeting.

"Great stuff. Lets chat in San Antonio. You owe me a beer anyway! We have been playing with several ""commercialisation of HR"" ideas including setting up our own recruitment search company to market talent we don't need/like that passes through the machine (plus unsuccessful redeployment people). Idea of developing our own Monster board in connection with this is very appealing (Europe already have a site which does some of what we need ""EnronCareers.Com""). If we can do something with our existing ad strategy without adding too much cost that would be outstanding. David From: Mark Palmer@ENRON on 11/10/2000 05:50 PM To: David Oxley/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: Subject: Re: My HR idea for the day.... Great idea. Problems with tagging on to existing commercials, though. In a thirty second spot, every second counts. The tag as proposed would eat up almost half the spot. I'll set aside the usual blather about the spots just being for brand development, corporate image, etc. We may want to look into producing a specific recruiting spot. That would be an interesting proposition. If the idea has commercial merit, we could find a way to fund it. Also, EBS has a new unit called Enron Media Services that might be able to help us source the media inventory (need to be a specific target) to run the spot. What do you think?

It is recommended that overtime requirements be used for non-exempt jobs only. The use of overtime in association with exempt jobs could be a risk in the case of a Department of Labor Wage and Hour audit. Exempt means that the employee is exempt from overtime calculations. Exempt employees are paid on a ""salary basis"" --this means that the employee is paid the same, pre-determined amount for each week they work. The reasoning behind this is that a white collar exempt worker is paid for the work done, not for the number of hours worked. If an employee wants to make a claim that we had classified them exempt but they feel they should be non-exempt and we have required them to work what we have referred to as ""overtime"" and not compensated them for it , we may be creating a liability for ourselves.

That being said, does HR follow a set of rules that are standard for all non-exempt promotions to exempt roles? In addition, are qualifications to meet those standards changed with each individual?

"David, You asked me to provide my opinion about the employment agreement provisions relating to target bonus amounts that are based on performance. The bonus language contained in the majority of the agreements with a target bonus is as follows: ""Provided that Enron meets its earnings targets and provided that Employee is rated within the top 25% of the performance criteria under Enron's annual performance rating system or its equivalent for the calendar year in question, Employee's annual bonus amounts under the Plan for calendar years 2001, 2002, and 2003 (payable in 2002, 2003, and 2004, respectively), shall be based on an annual bonus target of $_____________."" This language does not address a person's performance as compared to one's peers, but instead looks at the number of performance criteria and requires that a person be in the top 25% of those criteria. Thus, if there are only 3 rating categories (i.e., 1, 2, 3, distributed as 10-80-10), then only the people in the top category would be within the top 25/33% of the rating criteria. Given the huge change in our process, however, there is an argument that the above language cannot be applied to the current scheme and that instead, we should look at the top 25% of the peer group, instead of performance criteria, even though that was not the intent of the provision when it was drafted. As a result, I would suggest that the middle category be divided further into either 2 or 3 subcategories (i.e., 2A, 2B, or 2C",michelle.cash@enron.com,david.oxley@enron.com,"'David' : 'person', 'Employee' : 'person', 'Employee' : 'person'",3,Privileged and Confidential -- Performance Bonus Language,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,received,david.oxley@enron.com

"Dear David: Thanks so much for your voicemail message confirming your agreement and ass= urance that the Enron HR Global team will ensure compliance with the strate= gy approved by the Enron Corp. Board of Directors relating to the use of se= parate lines of business to manage Enron's risks, liabilities and costs. As you know Enron maintains many separate lines of business with separate a= ssets, directors, officers, employees and payrolls. This provides a protec= tive shield described or known as the ""corporate veil"". Thus, in the event= of litigation, only the assets of the individual business are subject to s= aid litigation, its attendant risks, liabilities and costs if Enron adheres= to basic corporate principles and the separate line of business is truly a= separate entity. If the corporate veil is pierced and other Enron entitie= s, including Enron Corp. are successfully subjected to the risks, liabiliti= es and costs of said litigation, then all of the assets of Enron would be a= t risk. Further, litigation, risk management, accounting and finance, tax= , treasury, and many other Enron Corp. groups work diligently to ensure com= pliance with this strategy. All filings with the federal government, inclu= ding the 10K and Proxy Statements, reflect this strategy. In addition, ther= e are certain Enron benefits, namely the Enron Corp. 1994 Deferral Plan, wh=",sharon.butcher@enron.com,david.oxley@enron.com,'David' : 'person',1,Enron Corp.
