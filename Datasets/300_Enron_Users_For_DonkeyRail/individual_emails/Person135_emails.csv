"Joel, I truly wish that I had something in my shop for you, but I don't.

The Gas Logistics team was ""relocated"" off the 41st floor on October 5. Prior to the move, we had a very efficient, open configuration that let us work together as a unified team. After the move, we are located on 3 different floors. Besides the general impact on team unity, this move also means that our evening staff work alone on separate floors, rather than in a group. It means fewer individuals to cover customer calls. It means having more equipment to cover the day to day business. I have worked hard to calm the team that this arrangement is just temporary and that we will eventually be put back together as a team. Prior to our move I constantly questioned whether our move was necessary. I asked about smaller, more practical changes to fit more people on the floor. And, I specifically asked about whether Enron issues might impact the groups desire to continue to spend $7-$10 million -- even as I reluctantly packed up my boxes. I hope you can appreciate that the current seating arrangement is a serious issue for my team and one that generates constant questions as my staff meetings.

Enron is a Pacesetter Company for the United Way and in that spirit, lets blaze the trails and have a rate of 100% participation.

I am pleased to report that my group has a 72% participation and I commend your efforts. I would like to aim for 100% participation by Wednesday evening. If you have not logged on to make a difference in the Houston community, we encourage to make a donation today or by Wednesday noon.

To participate, log on to <http://cr.enron.com> today to make your contribution. You'll need your GIS number to make your contribution.

We need to begin doing the deals beginning Monday to get the gas in place for the month. Our projected operational storage balance at the end of September is approx. 11.8 Bcf. The recommended levels for October that were discussed with the customers in the SLA proceeding was a low of 8 Bcf and a high of 12 Bcf. We feel that it would be prudent to be at or slightly above the high side of the range. Both Mary Kay and Dave agree that a 0.5 Bcf purchase would match the strategy that has been discussed with customers in the SLA proceedings. I have spoken with Jerry Peters and he feels that we have the necessary RAC approval based on last months approval process. Operationally, 0.5 Bcf fits well with our physical plan also. This leaves some room for potential long gas in Oct/Nov that would not compromise the integrity of the fields. If you have any questions, please give me a call at x7417.

Are you OK with me executing these?????? Also, I am working on another financing option with Kinder-Morgan which would basically increase Trailblazer's debt structure (partly in preparation of the next rate case in 2003) which would result in increased cash distribution to the partnersa in 2001. This cas could then be used to fund our cash call for the equity financing(30%) of the expansion. There would be a timing difference - we would get increased cash distributions in 2001, and then have to make our cash call in 2002 for appr. the same amount.

"Dan, Like you, I also received termination letters from Hewitt (as did Stan Horton, Jim Hughes, Bill Cordes and others). Last week, I asked Dan Batista from my staff to contact Corporate Benefits to investigate what happened and to what extent. Dan has reported the following: ""Termination letters"" were erroneously sent by Hewitt to several active employees. There was a problem with employee status information that was transmitted via an SAP interface from ENE to Hewitt for the 11/30/01 pay period. A number of employee records loaded into the Hewitt system with a termination date equal to their employment date. As the Hewitt system picked up these incorrectly terminated records, letters were triggered to employees informing them of their rights as terminated employees. The error was identified and has been fixed in the Hewitt system. All records were reported to be fixed by 12/26/01. Employees who received termination letters can log into the Savings Plan System under ""personal data"" to verify that their status has been corrected to ""active"". We have asked Corporate Benefits for a listing of employees who received the letters so the HR Reps can follow up with an explanation to those effected. -----Original Message----- From: McCarty, Danny Sent: Mon 12/31/2001 8:21 AM To: Smith, Gary; Olson, Cindy; Oxley, David Cc: Horton, Stanley Subject: Savings Plan Notices David, Cindy and Gary, Over the holidays I received not one, but three, notifications letting me know",gary.smith@enron.com,danny.mccarty@enron.com,"'Dan' : 'person', 'Stan Horton' : 'person', 'Jim Hughes' : 'person', 'Bill Cordes' : 'person', 'Dan Batista' : 'person', 'McCarty, Danny' : 'person', 'Smith, Gary' : 'person', 'Olson, Cindy' : 'person', 'Oxley, David' : 'person', 'Horton, Stanley' : 'person'",10,RE: Savings Plan Notices,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,received,danny.mccarty@enron.com
"Danny, Here's our comments- Paragraph 1 ANNGTC's FERC Form 2 filing says that they have received rate base approval for approx. $470 million of past investment (not including AFUDC). It is unclear how the total cash investment of the withdrawn partners relates to the $470 million number in the Form 2. We acknowledge that releasing any and all potential claims against the ANNGTC Partnership is an important principle to adopt to secure commercial commitments from the ANS Producers. In principle, we are prepared to release claims for the accrued AFUDC component but are not prepared to release claims for the $470 MM of past investment because regulators may allow a recovery mechanic, which could present future upsides to the Withdrawn Partners. We thus propose to modify this principle to provide for the inclusion of the $470 MM, but specifically exclude the AFUDC component. Ultimately, the toll for transport services will result through negotiations with the ANS Producers, and their concerns can be addressed by expressly excluding surcharges/other regulatory mechanics approved by the regulators for the initial investments. Par. 1, footnote ** Each ANS Producer that joins will cause the Current and Rejoining Partners' interests to be reduced pro rata, irrespective of when the new partners join. We should discuss limits on the rights of new partners to join, or a limits on the dilution.

It was a great morale builder. Thanks. We'll try to do this again next week if we have extra tickets (Astros cooperating of course).

Liability issues are overwhelming - - - GP role is just not feasible until residual claims go away. We are prepared to exchange our residual claims for AFUDC + interest accruals for the right to become a 9.4% GP at some later date, say commencement of construction or time of certificate. We want the partnership to make an all out effort to recover historic capital contributions either in rates or as an amortizable asset; likewise, we recognize that AFUDC and interest accruals are sunk. If we don't rejoin as a GP, we will walk away from AFUDC and interest accruals but want to be reimbursed historic capital contribution. Not comfortable with making any collective response to Sen.
