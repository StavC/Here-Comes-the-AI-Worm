"The events of September 11th are still very much with us and will continue to be for some time, perhaps for as long as we live. For those who have not heard me say this regarding air travel,individuals should avail themselves of the travel services the company is offering in the way of guidance for those that are traveling and only travel by air for essential matters( until further notice). In addition, anyone who is currently uncomfortable with the notion of air travel need not do so...we will work around this for as long as the need exists. The company has also provided information on the availability of counseling services should anyone have the need- please contact HR or the Benefits Group for further information. A final couple of notes: If there is a silver lining in the events of September 11th, it is the kindness, generosity, and humanity it brings out in the rest of us...I have seen this play out in untold ways in our ""group"",both in London and at home, over the last nine days , including( to a person) the absence of any hint of bias being shown towards the individual in our group who is an ""Arab American"" and a Muslim, Amr Ibrahim.

This amendment would have stricken language that provided an exclusion from CFTC jurisdiction for all non-agriculture transactions (energy, metals, broadband). The amendment failed, largely due to pressure from Enron, by a vote of 20-12. Rep. Ken Bensten (D-TX) joined Chairman Leach in speaking against the amendment. In more positive movement, yesterday the House Commerce Committee passed its version on the bill including a provision that exempts metal trading multilateral trading facilities from CFTC jurisdiction. Congress goes into recess tomorrow and we will have a better sense on how the Rules Committee plans to reconcile differences between the versions of the bill later this week.

First, the good news. The DPUC issued a final compliance decision (attached) Thursday approving the ENA prices and removing the draft language that would have released special contract customers. The bad news is that we are falling behind in finalizing the agreements with UI. Mostly this is due to unavailability of some of the UI personnel. The one business issue that is causing a bit of concern on their end is a fear that they have promised us too much in the way of an option on their nuclear generation. In any event, they have already made the commitments in our binding MOU. This issue is not a deal breaker but it is contributing to the delay. Right now we are scheduled to meet with them in NY Tuesday the 14th through Thursday the 16th. As a result, I can not be in Houston on the 15th as planned.

Sorry for not getting back to you before. Easter is a holiday in Venezuela and we got two days off. I am certainly involved in the domestic portion of the project, lobbying and educating Venezuelan authorities on its benefits in particular, and the benefits of an open and transparent market in general. I am working closely with Emilio Vicens and Guido Caranti who are leading the development of the project. The three of us have written extensive comments to regulations, have met on several opportunities with the regulator and with the Ministry of Energy and Mines (MEM), making significant progress on this front, such as allowing to create a working group to study the project in detail. The actual creation is still pending, but we will bring this issue during a meeting scheduled this week. Politics surrounding this project are complicated. PDVSA has traditionally imposed its views on MEM, who rubberstamped all its decisions. With the Chavez Administration, things have changed dramatically, almost paralizing every PDVSA initiative. Since PDVSA is the one that really needs to obtain the permit to supply the gas, PDVSA was ""in charge"" of dealing with MEM.

The UK DTI will keep paying him, so he is effectively free to us. They want a relevant job/work experience for him. Ian does not know about his willingness to commute during the week from San Francisco to LA (I told Ian we were receptive to these kinds of things, if all else worked out), but will check.

"A few months ago, I sent a note to the North American Government Affairs group commemorating a bit of an end point in our efforts relative to California. In that memo, I included a quote that went as follows ? ""What we do in life echoes through eternity"". I think of these words often and believe them more than ever, particularly after the events, both external and internal to Enron, of the last few months. I do not know for sure what the next few weeks or months will bring for any of us, but I do know that what we've done here at Enron in Government Affairs over the last several years, whether in Houston, Washington, London, Brussels, Sao Paulo, etc. was very good and will be remembered for the positive difference that we have all made in the industries in which we have worked and for each other. We even had a good time doing it. The good work we do will go on for many, if not, all of us . . . for some, here; for others, elsewhere. Regardless of what the future holds, we should all be quite proud of what we have accomplished here and how it has been accomplished. My personal appreciation for all that you have done as well as at having had the opportunity to be part of a group that, unfortunately, will be inalterably impacted and changed over the next few weeks, is boundless.

"The Government Affairs group is involved in diverse and complex activities. Tracking and quantifying these activities is important for several obvious reasons - to keep upper management apprised of our activities; to illustrate the value added and risk managed by our group; and to keep each other properly informed so that we can better coordinate our efforts. Currently, these activities take place on an ad-hoc manual basis, which is time-consuming and inefficient. We have a tool already in place to track our activities - the Project Tracking database in Lotus Notes. Currently this application is used primarily for RCR's, but beginning November 1, 2001, the Government Affairs group will use this application to track all projects and efforts - replacing the need for manual updated spreadsheets and activity quantification ""fire-drills"". The Projects have several features to allow capture of sub-sets of information, including Updates, Risk, Origination and Valuation. ** Please note that this will become the only way that we'll gather this information. In other words, if you don't enter your data into Project Tracking, we won't know what you're doing! **( all other reports will be eliminated) The current Lotus Notes application will be discontinued as of October 31,2001 and will be converted to a web-based product. You'll find the web-based version as easy or even easier to use than Lotus Notes. Additionally, conversion to a new database structure will allow for more versatile report extraction.

"FYI Today's FERC meeting was a big deal. Some of the key actions are: DSTAR and RTO West are to be ""married,"" The FERC wants a single western RTO but will wait on making CAISO merge with other western RTOs so that California can ""heal its wounds."" Every utility needs to declare which RTO it plans to join by 12/1/01 (or possibly 12/15; not sure of date). Otherwise the utility will lose market-based rates, will be unable to get a merger approved, and will have its transmission rev req. scrutinized. The commission favors 1 market structure applied to the four nationwide RTOs. It plans on holding a week of workshops and issuing a NOPR to determine this structure. The goal is to essentially re-issue the Order 888 tariff in a form that encompases the new functions of RTOs. Although consistent business rules applied to large geographic markets are a good thing, expect this new effort and redefining the RTO to delay ultimate implementation. Although California will be allowed to heal, it is ordering an operational audit of the Calfornia ISO. Separately the FERC indicated the plan to issue a NOPR on market power and market based rates. Expect new rules and procedure to determine whether a market is sufficiently competitive to allow for market based rates. Further summary, prepared by Sarah Novosel in our Govt. Affairs DC office, is provided bel o w The Commission held its first open meeting with Pat Wood as the new Chairman",richard.shapiro@enron.com,"mark.frevert@enron.com, greg.whalley@enron.com, janet.dietrich@enron.com,

"Terry was acting with full coordination from Jose. The problem was this: Daly insisted someone speak on behalf of the group to the press (and designated Terry to be the one); Terry did not have the updated information that we were about to meet with the government officials and deliver a slightly different message (i.e. that we needed to know if the government planned to really open Petrobras or not -- the implication being that we would work within either decision but we needed to know one way or the other); Terry was simply not in possession of this information and no one had given it to him (probably because they had no reason to assume that Terry would be thrust in front of the press); moreover, it's hard to see how Terry could have taken such a position publicly anyway. By my eyes Terry did the best he could and we had an unavoidable communications bust.

"Rick, as you are likely aware, Ontario market opening has once again been pushed back with March 2002 likely the earliest possible start. From a strategic standpoint, you will recall that we decided to align our interests with the outcome of the OEB/IMO readiness report due out in September. Our regulatory position was that it was highly likely that the outcome of this report would be positive and by supporting this initiative it would push the government to immediately open the market (likely November 2001). In the interim however, the OEB has unilaterally deferred market opening to 2002 with the deferral of stage 2 of the self-certification process from August to December. In my mind, we actually gave credence to the OEB and to some extent gave them the mandate to defer market opening. Lets discuss when you have a moment.

"Rick, Some comments from Nick are attached below. Nick's first comment reflects a general concern I had about the paper which was it's treatment of imbalance settlement. I would see this as one of the essential elements of market design. I've always felt that the physical/financial distinction was slightly artificial because even with ""physical"" contracts, power systems must have a means for cash settlement of imbalances (in the absence of universal controls which limit actual takes to contract volumes). However, the paper does not really pick this up and in section 3.1 implies that cash settlement might only be ""feasible"" in some market structures. I would have added imbalance settlement to section 2.1 which describes the fundamentals required for any market. It would also help to draw a brighter distinction between spot markets and imbalance settlement. At the same time I would have dropped the mention of ""binding market rules"" from 2.1. I'd see this as a subset of the need for an ISO to take over the operation of the system in real time rather than as a separate fundamental principle. It's also not made clear in what sense these commitments are binding. Are they binding in a financial sense (in which case they are covered by imbalance settlement) or somehow physically (either this is unfeasible since units trip etc or it requires some form of balancing penalty which is ruled out later in the paper). I felt that the paper also compounded issues such as LMP's/transmission rights with other non-location",paul.dawson@enron.com,richard.shapiro@enron.com,"'Rick' : 'person', 'Nick' : 'person', 'Nick' : 'person'",3,FW: Frontier Economics' Whitepaper,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,received,richard.shapiro@enron.com
"Rick. Let's pause and reflect on this bullet. Do we want to argue for that? This is going to start another Federal/State rights war!! and I do not believe this is going to help much and would require legislation. Federal siting and permitting authority must be expanded to allow for the construction of new transmission and generation facilities. Maybe in some less populated states, or for sitting facilities in the middle of no-where this is not a problem, but my experience in Florida is that the sitting process is very much intertwined with property rights and ROW acquisition, ultimately relying on condemnation. To get there, in Florida there is a process to establish that there was a ""public need"" that required government action. At FPL we relied on the process to obtain an eventual outcome where there was the force-of- law [of the greater public good to be able to obtain the ROW]. This was crucial for the Transmission ROW for all lines greater than 240 KV. (Many more individual owners and 100% needed to complete the connection within the selected route). The sitting process for the generation site was not as controversial, because we acquired (or held rights to) sites which had been pre-screened to avoid controversy; but, obviously a permit for a generation site is useless if you can't get the power into the grid, thus you need the Transmission ROW. Part of the process involved providing options/ and costs, community involvement, etc. - which ultimately resulted in a ""choice"" determined to have been ""prudent",jose.bestard@enron.com,richard.shapiro@enron.com,'Rick' : 'person',1,Re: Lay/Skilling Talking Points for Bush Admin Meetings and Calls,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,received,richard.shapiro@enron.com

"1. Dynegy vs. ComEd at FERC Dynegy filed a complaint at FERC that tries to disallow Firm LD from being used by marketers under the ComEd Network Service. IP claims that is losing $ MM because customers are not paying for Capacity. This will impact our ability to ""go physical"" starting next year. 2. MISO vs. ARTO IP is a member of the ARTO. EPMI continues to try and establish only one RTO in the region. I think this is why Dynegy won't state very clearly that 4 RTOs makes sense. No $ impact, although this decision may impact our ability to ""go physical"" starting next year in Illinois. 3. CTC Bet in ComEd My recollection (talking with Harry K.) is that we pre-sold a CTC roll-off in ComEd that could cost our business around $10 MM if it doesn't happen. Most talk in Illinois is that CTC should end early for big customers, so not sure if this is an issue. 4. Delivery Service Tariff Litigation ComEd and IP have filed to increase their rates on Delivery Service Tariffs (but not on Bundled customers because there is a statutory rate cap). EES told us originally that this could cost as much as $50MM, but current estimates are closer to $10MM for ComEd and $2MM for IP. 5.

"TOP 10 PRIORITIES 1. Alberta Power Purchase Agreements - If Enron Canada is successful in the PPA auction, Enron Canada will have a very long position in the Alberta wholesale market; continued risk mitigation efforts, advocacy of good transmission and distribution tariffs, and development of rules for Plan ""B"" ( for those units that received no bids) will be critical. 2. Continued support for ongoing commercial transactions other than the PPAs and help in identification of where commercial opportunities are. (An example of the later, work with commercial people to analyze how recent initiative re transmission tariff and wholesale market design in Ontario enhance opportunities for ""Power by the Hour"" and other distributed generation projects.) 3. Ontario Electricity Market Opening - work to avoid further delay in market opening and advise on the development of procedures and practices for the new market. (As an example of the later, working with traders in Toronto and Houston to understand mechanisms for interregional trade and transmission rights, and the commercial opportunities that exist.) 4.

"Rick - here goes for a draft announcement. I've written it as coming from Michael, but it should be easily amended if the sender differs. ""I am pleased to announce some organisational changes to the European Government and Regulatory Affairs Group. Paul Dawson will become head of the group taking responsibility for government and regulatory affairs across continental Europe in addition to his current UK responibilities. Paul will report directly to myself and will be strongly supported by the other senior members of the team: Doug Wood (Continental Gas), Peter Styles (EU and Continental Power) and Paul Hennemeyer (German speaking countries). Richard Lewis and Eric Shaw will continue to work closely with the group with Rick Shapiro continuing to provide the team with strategic guidance to ensure that the European Government Affairs group is fully integrated within the global government affairs function. I believe these changes will enable us to maintain Enron's leadership in regulatory efforts to broaden the markets available to us, to capitalise on regulatory changes and to continue the group's major contribution to our commercial success in the UK and Continental Europe etc Michael Brown"" Hope this is OK for a general announcement - not sure there is much more to say to the wider audience without dwelling on justifications and the finer points of how the respective responsibilities will pan out.

For a start, we need to go back and address the fundamentals: the implications of Japan's deregulating market on forward power prices the permits required for construction and operation of power plants and related facilities, and the time needed to obtain those permits the ability to access the transmission network at the preferred sites in a timely and cost effective manner Over the next few weeks, I will be undertaking a comprehensive regulatory review and will develop a lobbying strategy to address each of the barriers to timely development of EnCom's projects. Having said that, there is a real possibility that the permitting process cannot be shortened within an acceptable time frame, or that an assessment of forward power prices suggests that under certain scenarios it would be uneconomical to proceed with development of one or more of the projects. Forward Power Prices. EPower is currently using a projected forward power price for 2007 and beyond based on the price paid by TEPCO to IPPs in 1995/96. Deregulation is inevitable in Japan and international experience suggests that a period of significantly lower wholesale power prices will likely follow, particularly given that",nicholas.o'day@enron.com,richard.shapiro@enron.com,"'Nicholas O'Day' : 'person', 'Nicholas O'Day' : 'person', 'John Sherriff' : 'person', 'Carey' : 'person'",4,EPower Regulatory situation,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,received,richard.shapiro@enron.com
