"Anil, Questions for you: Is Zircom in an easily definable industry so we can make comparable studies and valuations? Is their much public history of the firm? Will such an acquisition have a significant influence on Intel's earnings (my guess is no since Zircom's latest annual revenue was only $500 million versus Intel's $20+ billion revenue)? Can we make reasonable future estimates of Zircom's financial statements and business lines? I, for one, have little knowledge or confidence in myself of analyzing a tech company. Given the fact that Anil is the only person in the industry from our group we would be heavily reliant on him to give us strategic insight on the companies and their businesses. My preference- an industry that is relatively more stable and simple for all of us to understand. While we don't have to do Amazon specifically, I would like an industry or company that won't require an immersion of readings just to understand the product, sales distribution, clients, distributors, etc. Remember, we have to make guestimates about the future of the industry and predict sales, costs, etc. The nice thing about Amazon (or a similar company) is that it is merely an Internet twist on an industry with a very long history and an easy to understand business model. Webvan could be another example. Another idea: Trying to value Fidelity Investments- a private company. The nice thing about this exercise is that there is a lot of data on comparable companies (T.

"Hey kids, My two cents. No problems with the model or the assumptions. I thought it would be interesting to look at a 3-stage model where the growth of the company has extremely fast growth in the beginning, and then a slower growth before the terminal valuation stage (zero growth). Under this model, to justify a $28 stock price, Netscape would have to grow 60% annually for the first 5 years, and 30% for the next 5 years. Thinking big picture, it would not be out of the ordinary for Netscape to be generating $1 billion in revenue after 10 years of growth. Netscape would probably be able to generate such revenue but not without branching into other services or products, most of which would not have been developed in 1996, i.e. Netscapes stock price includes the optionality of future services and products that they haven't even generated yet. I was dubious then as I am now that Netscape could be worth so much with a single and free product. We will need to address in our memo the likelihood that Netscape could leverage their early success into other profitable ventures. My simple adjustments to the model are attached. PS Jeff- You asked for an example of the agency dilemma. A good example of this can be demonstrated by the largest (at the time) leveraged buyout of RJR Nabisco where the company was generating a lot of free cash flow that was being spent on perquisites- company jets, golf tournaments, etc. This was because management had different",mark_guinney@watsonwyatt.com,"bradykw@aol.com, jcjcal02@aol.com, jeff.dasovich@enron.com",'Jeff' : 'person',1,Re:NETSCAPE,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,sent,mark_guinney@watsonwyatt.com

"I was just brainstorming on potential projects. I thought that an interesting and fairly relevant topic could be a current evaluation of Amazon.com and how the projected revenues & profits relate to the current stock price. We could also provide some historical perspective on all realistic Amazon's stock price was a year or two ago relative to a discounted cash flow. I can fairly easily get my hands on some Wall Street analyst research reports that could provide us with some insights and hints as to what Wall Street is expecting. Most of our time can be spent creating a discounted cash flow model similar to what we have been doing in class. Since the jury is still out on Amazon's business model, I think it would make for some interesting debate in class when we present our model. ********************************************** Mark D.

"Hey kids, My two cents. No problems with the model or the assumptions. I thought it would be interesting to look at a 3-stage model where the growth of the company has extremely fast growth in the beginning, and then a slower growth before the terminal valuation stage (zero growth). Under this model, to justify a $28 stock price, Netscape would have to grow 60% annually for the first 5 years, and 30% for the next 5 years. Thinking big picture, it would not be out of the ordinary for Netscape to be generating $1 billion in revenue after 10 years of growth. Netscape would probably be able to generate such revenue but not without branching into other services or products, most of which would not have been developed in 1996, i.e. Netscapes stock price includes the optionality of future services and products that they haven't even generated yet. I was dubious then as I am now that Netscape could be worth so much with a single and free product. We will need to address in our memo the likelihood that Netscape could leverage their early success into other profitable ventures. My simple adjustments to the model are attached. PS Jeff- You asked for an example of the agency dilemma. A good example of this can be demonstrated by the largest (at the time) leveraged buyout of RJR Nabisco where the company was generating a lot of free cash flow that was being spent on perquisites- company jets, golf tournaments, etc. This was because management had different",mark_guinney@watsonwyatt.com,"bradykw@aol.com, jcjcal02@aol.com, jeff.dasovich@enron.com",'Jeff' : 'person',1,Re:NETSCAPE,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,sent,mark_guinney@watsonwyatt.com

"Not a problem. My concern is less about you and me---we both have views and are comfortable with the back and forth banter. I'm actually concerned about Carolyn. She has worked hard on this, and I think wants to be involved and participatory. I had the sense that she was feeling that she'd done a bunch of work that was ending up on the cutting room floor and that she wasn't getting a real opportunity to participate in the shaping of the analysis, the presentation, or responsibility for taking a piece of the presentation for Thursday. I was sensing that she was frustrated. Anil is also less extroverted, but based on discussions with him, I think that he is less concerned because he has some other pretty cosmic things on his plate right now. My real concern is that everyone feels comfortable, understanding that working in groups is all about compromise, and that one should really expect to get about 70% or less of one's views included in a final product, given the nature of group dynamic. I think we're getting close to something that everyone will good about, which is a pretty good goal to go after. Thanks a bunch for the note.

I don't feel strongly about the recommendation, just wanted to throw out something for folks to shoot at and to highlight that A/R and inventory turnover is big problem.

"I took a stab at drafting the memo. I pooped out on the last question, however and was only able to jot down some thoughts. Caution: The memo ain't been proofed. I did it as a memo to the CEO of Timberland, but we don't need to do it that way. Also attaching files (one each for each of the scenarios asked for, so that folks could see what I did).

"I apologize, but I won't be in SF Monday evening, and this week coming up will be a grinder. I have a lot of time to work on it over the weekend, though. I can provide a fax number tomorrow where the materials can be sent to me. And I assume that they are on the Izio site, too. I'm going to go there now. Tomorrow, I'll try to crunch some numbers and outline the one-pager and distribute to folks by the end of the day. Then perhaps we can email each other on Monday and try to make some progress on the memo by the end of the day. That should put us in pretty good shape to finish it up Tuesday and Wednesday. If I can't get the materials off of Izio, I'll let you know. I'll report back in the AM tomorrow with a proposed game plan, once I've collected all the materials and pondered things a bit. Sound reasonable? Thoughts? Just let me know. Mark, I hope that if you're in Denver, that means you're skiing.

"computer lab for modeling. same thing this thursday. Here's some stuff I worked on over the weekend. OAT's balance sheet and income statement and common-sized. Haven't put together the cash flow yet. Please take a look. Really wanted to get something in a file for folks to start looking at so that, together with the materials Anil and Carolyn have pulled together, we can start filling in our assumptions and doing some valuations. I can do the same for Coke and Pepsi. Take a peek and let's try to discuss by email. Or I'm up for a conference call tomorrow or Wednesday (or a meeting in person) if you folks are game.

"Not a problem. My concern is less about you and me---we both have views and are comfortable with the back and forth banter. I'm actually concerned about Carolyn. She has worked hard on this, and I think wants to be involved and participatory. I had the sense that she was feeling that she'd done a bunch of work that was ending up on the cutting room floor and that she wasn't getting a real opportunity to participate in the shaping of the analysis, the presentation, or responsibility for taking a piece of the presentation for Thursday. I was sensing that she was frustrated. Anil is also less extroverted, but based on discussions with him, I think that he is less concerned because he has some other pretty cosmic things on his plate right now. My real concern is that everyone feels comfortable, understanding that working in groups is all about compromise, and that one should really expect to get about 70% or less of one's views included in a final product, given the nature of group dynamic. I think we're getting close to something that everyone will good about, which is a pretty good goal to go after. Thanks a bunch for the note.
