"Where are we with www.enrononline.com? -----Original Message----- From: Forster, David Sent: Tuesday, January 29, 2002 6:26 PM To: Kitchen, Louise Subject: Marketing Issues Louise, 1) I just received a call from Pat O'Donnell asking us to hold off on marketing to the Top 50 customers until he is able to address an email he just received from UBS corporate marketing folks, instructing us not to use the url: www.ubswenergy.com. It seems they want us to use www.ubswarburg.com/energy. Pat is going to argue on behalf of ubswenergy.com tomorrow. He anticipates having resolution by noon. I personally don't care much what URL we use: the brand name and achieving concensus to get this off the ground is more important. Of course, a change in URL now means we have to go back through the site and change all the references again. . . 2) UBS (in the form of Matt Meinel, who feels Mike Hutchins will be in agreement with him) do not want us to redirect traffic from www.enrononline.com to the new site, as they feel that promotes too much of an association with Enron. I disagree with their position, but don't think this is too big a deal - we will just need to more heavily promote the new website name. Also, the execution version of the contract apparantly dropped the redirect requirement. Please let me know if you have any issues with the above and how you want to proceed.

The Main reception number at the applicant company is called and a senior contact in the Trading Department is requested ? A Vice President or Director of trading is requested for verification of the PA signatory as an authorized person to bind the company to Master Agreements and online contracts for commodity trading purposes. The company is informed that the phone call is being recorded. ?

"Good morning everyone, Thankyou for responding promptly. I think this draft better captures the Master / GTC approach though I thought we were going to change the title of the Internete Trading Access Agreement to something reflecting 'Password Application'. Also the wording which has been added at the end of the agreement is obviously only US specific - does this mean that we are going to have to have different Agreements on the page depending on the location of the person who clicks on it? Obviously the fact that the law is different on the written one is OK as can be altered by jurisdiction but the same issue does arise on the online agreement. This causes issues so I'll need a respond immediately on this and would appreciate Mark and Justin discussing this today. For information, I attach Schwab's agreement from the web which is quite simplistic in look and feel - could we adopt any of this approach - no WHEREAS is a good start.

I've been assuming (maybe incorrectly) that with your new responsibilities (home and work) that you might pass on it this year - but I want that to be your decision. If you want to do it, we certainly would appreciate your help. If you can't do it, I'd appreciate any recommendation you might have for a replacement.

"Louise: Apologies, but I forgot to mention a couple items on Florida on this morning's call. With respect to our Florida development book, and the Midway site in particular, we have 4 value propositions that we're working on. We talked about the first one, which relates to the sale of the development asset (with a target gross sales price of $13 million). The others are as follows: 1. Leverage site positions to bid into FPL's recently announced 1,700MW RFP. 2. Leverage site positions to negotiate third party long term tolling contracts for unit contingent power. 3. Leverage site positions to build a merchant power plant. On item 1, we have been speaking with FPL for some time, and we think we may have a competitive advantage (because of the number and maturity of our development assets) to offer a unit contingent contract to FPL, or simply a sale of one or more sites. If we were awarded a contract, we could go in the market, buy turbines, and flip the package (a la LV Cogen). Heather Kroll and I are working on this together. On item 2, I was contacted by Williams a couple of weeks ago. They indicated they were interested in a 10 to 15 year tolling contract off our Midway site. We have since signed a confidentiality agreement, and are discussing indicative terms. As with item 1, if we negotiated a deal with Williams, we could go in the market, buy turbines, and flip the package. Aquila is also a prospect for this type of deal, as they are seeking long term toll",ben.jacoby@enron.com,louise.kitchen@enron.com,"'Louise' : 'person', 'Heather Kroll' : 'person', 'Williams' : 'person', 'Williams' : 'person', 'Aquila' : 'person'",5,Follow-up to this mornings meeting,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,received,louise.kitchen@enron.com

"Louise, Looking forward to seeing you next week. I am sure that we will have much to talk about and I will compensate by talking very fast. Upstream Products I am meeting today with Scott Josey regarding Pluto/MEGS. John Lavorato asked me revisit with him regarding this residual position from Production Offshore and did not want me to assume that although ECR is responsible for restructuring Mariner, that Josey would also take on the P&L responsibility associated with this project. Depending on the outcome of the meeting will determine whether or not Pluto/MEGS ends up in the new Principal Investments headed by Kevin Garland or ECR. Personally, the Pluto/MEGS transaction should be valued and restructured with all of Mariner and should be redeployed to ECR. Principal Investments does not have the expertise or connections to evaluate this transaction. Most of the individuals have been redeployed in Production Offshore with the exception of Lisa Druzbik. Tom Byargeon has decided to work with Randy Maffett over at EGM. I am sure that you are disappointed by his decision and I tried my best to keep him within ENA. Tom wants to do asset based finance and was not interested in leading the Producer Ecommerce group. I spoke with Dave Duran and impressed upon him how we both wanted to retain Tom within ENA and that his organizations could be a good fit with his background.

"Louise: Please find the attached presentation that Jean, Don and I came by to discuss with you. I know you are up to your eyes in credit issues, so we can talk about this when you get a chance. We wanted to review the impact of the merger on Bridgeline. Specifically, the potential benefits for putting in place an asset management structure for BHLP. Dynegy has expressed interest in commercially managing these assets and Enron would to, if we would not have to pay an excessive fee to do so. Jean's initial analysis indicates that Bridgeline is currently undervaluing the accrual value of the pipe and over-valuing trading. We may be able to use this fact to our advantage in establishing a ""low"" asset management fee to pay to Bridgeline. In addition, we may be able to reduce our deployed capital by selling the accrual value in BHLP to an MLP who is willing to pay a premium for stable cash/earnings. The MLP could be one of Enron's (e.g. Northern Boarder, EOTT), or a Chev/Tex MLP (?), or even a 3rd party MLP. The deciding factor should be the value the MLP is willing to pay for the earnings stream. We have continued to discuss this with the Chev/Tex board members who remain interested in evaluating the benefits of this structure. In their view, the Dynegy/Enron merger is a positive fact because it removes the Dynegy vs. Enron competition. When you get a chance we can talk.

Importance: High I met this morning with Stephen Noe, the Director handling the potential transaction for Duke Energy Field Services. The purpose of the meeting was to discuss outstanding due diligence items and attempt to get Duke to raise their non-binding $14.1 MM offer. However, the first thing Stephen did was offer an apology. Duke has found a significant bust in their valuation model. ( As if we had not already had enough bad news today!) Duke had overstated the depreciation deduction which resulted in a tax credit for the project. The depreciation schedule was apparently left over from a previous evaluation. In addition, Duke conducts its evaluation on an after tax basis. The resulting corrected evaluation with a 10.5% discount factor on an after tax basis yields a minimum value of $11.5 MM with no upside included in the evaluation. During the meeting, we called Lisa Druzbik and had her run the Enron model an after tax basis using 7 year MACRS for depreciation. The Enron model confirmed the after tax Duke evaluation.

"Louise -- While I have already reduced the allocation to EA by 15% or over $400,000, I have talked with Accounting regarding your concerns and have suggested a few changes to the allocations. The new suggested allocations are EA 30%, EGM 20%, EIM 20%, ENW 20%, EBS 10% and EEOS 5%. This is based on services provided and headcount within the various business units. The services include media relations, events, marketing & advertising, and internal communications. There is no increase in headcount. We are at 10 positions, which is the exact same number we have had since February 2001. In fact, I reduced the size of the group by 2 positions when I was promoted to lead the department in May 1999. The two reductions are one less person in Marketing and Advertising, and one less person in Events.

"Louise, Thanks for your voicemail, which I picked up late last night at home. I'll try to call you on your mobile later today, but I'll be leaving the office early today on a business trip. In case I miss you, I wanted to get back to you in this notesmail (I understand you're picking up email in Houston). I've left Justin a voicemail on this as well. I think your proposal for legal staffing sounds great. I think using Clifford Chance as project manager is a good idea and will speed up the process. My only suggestion is that we use our normal outside Continental counsel for both the internet issues and the trading/commodity issues, as opposed to using CC's Continental offices for internet issues and our normal outside Continental counsel for the trading/commodity issues. (Of course, we'd use CC London for the UK internet issues.) Let me tell you why I think this will work better. First, CC doesn't have local offices in all the jurisdictions we're looking at, so we'll need to use our normal outside counsel in several of the jurisdictions for both areas in any event. Second, I think there's less chance of something falling through a crack if we use the same firm for both areas in each country.

"Attached hereto is the current draft of Transition Services Agreement pursuant to which Enron will provide certain services to Netco and Netco will rpovide certain services to Enron. I hope that this is what you are looking for. If you are looking for the division of assets between Enton and Netco, that will be detailed in the schedules to the agreement whereby the vaious assets are transferred to from Enron to Netco. These schedules list the software and hardware and other assets that will be transferred to Netco and the software. hardware and other assets are remaining with Enron, as well as those assets (primarily third party software) that Netco will need to obtain on its own. The transition services agreement is intended in large part to bridge the gap between (i) the time of the sale and transfer of assets to Netco and (ii) time when Netco acquires these software programs and other assets.

They have delayed giving us a written proposal over the last two weeks. The latest is that they have said that they will give us something on Tuesday of next week. With respect to the burn rate, we are projecting about $20 million in expenditures over the next month. Our current investment is about $220 million. I think you should also have a rough idea of how we are funding this and what the plan is over the next couple of months. The investment is currently funded through an off-balance sheet / on-credit vehicle with WestLB. The WestLB vehicle is structured to fund the plant through commercial operations. The plan is to have the OPIC financing in place to take out the WestLB vehicle. This would infer an approximate $95 million equity investment upon the take-out of the WestLB vehicle. We are currently in the process of syndicating the equity. We have one indicative proposal for 50% of the equity. We hope to have another next week. There are some specific timing issues that you need to be aware of. WestLB did not want to take operating risk in the financing. Our position with WestLB is that we do not reach commercial operations until we reach the start date of the Petrobras contract. We are currently producing energy into the grid.

"The list of proposed Netco employees that Amy Fitzpatrick provided to me at your request included tabs for Weather and Crude. Do you contemplate that Netco would trade those commodities/products? Bob Hall's team that he has assembled for Netco does not include anyone with either Weather or Crude operations experience. We retained two top-notch operations individuals - Todd Hall and Kevin Sweeney - who at this time are not on the list for Netco. Both have extensive risk management experience and both have also managed all aspects of trading operations - documentation, risk books and settlements. Todd and Kevin each are good managers and they are working managers who know how to execute the details. Todd has most recently been in charge of all aspects of operations for Weather. Prior to has role in EGM, Todd created the MPR and supported all daily activities around valuing the assets in that portfolio. He also has had extensive experience in gas risk management. Sweeney's most recent assignment has been to manage operations for EIM. The bulk of his Enron experience has been in crude and crude products. He was part of the original team that opened the Singapore trading office and has experience in the UK as well.

We talked about the first one, which relates to the sale of the development asset (with a target gross sales price of $13 million). The others are as follows: 1. Leverage site positions to bid into FPL's recently announced 1,700MW RFP. 2. Leverage site positions to negotiate third party long term tolling contracts for unit contingent power. 3. Leverage site positions to build a merchant power plant. On item 1, we have been speaking with FPL for some time, and we think we may have a competitive advantage (because of the number and maturity of our development assets) to offer a unit contingent contract to FPL, or",ben.jacoby@enron.com,louise.kitchen@enron.com,"'Ben' : 'person', 'Kitchen, Louise' : 'person', 'Jacoby, Ben' : 'person', 'Jacoby, Ben' : 'person', 'Kitchen, Louise' : 'person', 'Louise' : 'person'",6,RE: Follow-up to this mornings meeting,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,received,louise.kitchen@enron.com
