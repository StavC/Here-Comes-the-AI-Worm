BLOOMBERG Are you talking about the broker fee? Yes the fee is $15.00 Flat per Bloomberg's confirmation on both of these deals. PREBON Bob said Matt Motley gave him this deal to do.

He was just walking into a meeting with Tim Belden while I was trying to figure this out with him, and he asked that I not change anything until he gets out and can look at it more closely. A price of $141 is awfully low for a peak deal flowing at Mid-C tomorrow - actually lower than the off-peak prices - so it sounds a little suspicious.

"Evelyn, I'm so sorry I haven't found these deals yet!

One of those guys should be back in the office momentarily, and I'll let you know when I've talked to them.
