"JS & MM: Here is a quick summary of some my thoughts with regard to fundamentals as we begin finalization objectives and goals for 2002. I would like to discuss these issues with both you next week. EWS Fundamentals: The Time Has Come Phyically We are Together but ""Informationally"" We are Not: ECS will be great for increasing phyisical proximity, but what are we doing to increase the flow of information across desks, commodities and people. The MSG Board is a first step in the right direction But we need to finish the ""last mile"". Information is still not disseminated effectively. Better Information and Rationalization of Resources It time to consider having one EWS fundamentals site. It is both silly and a waste of resources to have multiple models for various commodities. Information and efforts need to be shared across the company. Having multiples sites also limits information flow to trading. Traders should not have to search across multiple sites to receive information. Why are 3 different analysts doing the same job in three different groups. (Example: Power, Gas, Crude--all do their own API analysis- why have 3? keep the best one and make it stronger. Publications and IT are Expensive This year we have eliminated duplication within EGM with regard to publications. It is now time to move cost consolidation across EWS. Some publications cost in excess of $100K per year. All duplication needs to be eliminated. It is very expensive to keep 3 IT teams developing 3 different fundy sites. In EGM alone, this year we have spent $1.5MM on",jennifer.fraser@enron.com,"a..shankman@enron.com, mike.mcconnell@enron.com",'JS & MM' : 'person',1,Cost Reductions-- and Better Information Across EWS,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,sent,jennifer.fraser@enron.com

Thanks Jen Dear Ms. Fraser, I am writing after having heard from a contact at Enron that you are seeking a number of people to fill various vacancies at your Houston office. If this is the case I would very much like to be considered for one of these vacancies. As you will notice from the attached Curriculum Vitae I am currently employed as an Energy Markets Consultant at Wood Mackenzie in Edinburgh, the energy consultancy arm of Deutsche Bank. My prior work experience includes two years as a Gas Markets Analyst for a Management Consultancy firm in London, time as an Energy Journalist covering the European gas and electricity markets and a year long spell as an academic Research Assistant. Prior to these positions I read for an MSc in Energy Studies at the Centre for Energy, Petroleum and Mineral Law and Policy at the University of Dundee, Scotland. Whilst reading for the MSc I elected to specialise in oil and gas industry economics and law. Before undertaking the MSc I read for a B.A. (Hons) Business Administration degree. This allowed me to build, develop and hone to a high standard the essential skills of financial, strategic, business and economic analysis.

"confused... what are you disagreeing with me in regards to demand destruction? From: Jennifer Fraser/ENRON@enronXgate on 03/07/2001 08:55 AM To: John Arnold/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: Subject: rebuttal I am definitely a bigger fan of the crude complex for the next few months. Agree the defcon 5 bubble has burst for natgas. Disagree about the demand destruction. ? I think some demand is just permanently gone ( i.3. cheaper BTUs in ASIA- Pacific and plants just wont run here anymore). But I think that we are underestimating the structural changes in energy demand. Just as the economy is less dependent on heavy industry for its health, energy demand is changing. Since just about everyone missed the boat on the increased power demand as a result of Silicon Valley, I think we don't have a good handle on what the drivers of the new power generation really are.So what i'm saying is that industrial demand will weaken, demand in service based industries will increase. Also energy is a much smaller component of the cost structure in service industries. ? Also I think in 2000, people had sticker shock-- they couldn't have imagined 10$ gas, but now that volatility and higher prices are firmly entrenched in their minds --- they will find ways of running their factories. Also they will budget for these prices instead of $2.50 ?

"confused... what are you disagreeing with me in regards to demand destruction? From: Jennifer Fraser/ENRON@enronXgate on 03/07/2001 08:55 AM To: John Arnold/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: Subject: rebuttal I am definitely a bigger fan of the crude complex for the next few months. Agree the defcon 5 bubble has burst for natgas. Disagree about the demand destruction. ? I think some demand is just permanently gone ( i.3. cheaper BTUs in ASIA- Pacific and plants just wont run here anymore). But I think that we are underestimating the structural changes in energy demand. Just as the economy is less dependent on heavy industry for its health, energy demand is changing. Since just about everyone missed the boat on the increased power demand as a result of Silicon Valley, I think we don't have a good handle on what the drivers of the new power generation really are.So what i'm saying is that industrial demand will weaken, demand in service based industries will increase. Also energy is a much smaller component of the cost structure in service industries. ? Also I think in 2000, people had sticker shock-- they couldn't have imagined 10$ gas, but now that volatility and higher prices are firmly entrenched in their minds --- they will find ways of running their factories. Also they will budget for these prices instead of $2.50 ?

"fill me in. how can i eavesdrop?? To: John Arnold/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: Subject: Re: NG YEAR ENd Quiz I belong to a natgas discussion group on the internet. This is from one of the guys. Basically they are a bunch of gastraders from various firms ( a lot of producers, some industrials, some small shops and few i--banker types) I found the test to be mildly amusing. And since I had no idea what 'club no minors' was-- i was hoping for some insight from you guys. Fortunately, the lovely Ms. Shipos was able to fill me in. Anyway, while occasionally garbage, the discussions do provide insight on what others are thinking of production, storage and other such matters. And when I was a marketer, I found a few leads. Finally, since a lot of the information revolves around gossip about a particular 'super trader' at the big ENE , i find it amusing that one of the most reserved and modest individuals I know is so talked about on the internet.
