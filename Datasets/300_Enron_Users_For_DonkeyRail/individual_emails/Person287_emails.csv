"Hi Vince, I talked to Tom Gros today and metioned our desire to estabilish a strategic relationship with Nick Bambos and his research effort. Tom is very excited about the idea and was willing to cut the check. I suggested that we have more of a strategic relationship in mine (Enron / Stanford) and he agreed to that as well. Tom mentioned that Greg Whalley was interested in estabilishing such a relationship. Vince, could you follow this up and ground this? If you need any help in doing the leg work, I'll happy to do that. Tom is excited about EBS research's role to support all of EBS including bandwidth trading. He seems very interested in being our sponsor on the EBS side. That would be very beneficial to us since he is involved in all senior management decision through Kevin Hannon. Vince, I would suggest that you try to setup a meeting with Kevin Hannon and Tom to discuss this further. Tom is also very interested in the New Product development effort that Larry and I have been kicking around for some time. He wanted us to sit back and think of structured products with better margins that Blend & Extend that they are selling. He wanted to know now much more resource that we need in that front. For this, I would like to get someone like Meera Natarajan. She is an originator currently working in EES and have talked to Zimin and Stinson.

None of this is technical by any means. If anything, it is more like engineering consulting (from deal perspective) by EBS Research to John's group. I will bring it up with John tomorrow night about bringing our technical guys on such road trips so that they can get involved with his group even though no optimization modeling work may need to be done. For this I will use Samer and/or Chonawee but we need to be certain that they are available on such on-call basis as stated below. John is very clear and specific about who he ask to be at such meeting and when, etc. Normally he does not want any deviations. So if we put someone on such jobs, they have to be able to travel on-call anywhere, any place. That is the time pressure he is working with.

"Hi Stinson, as per our discussion, here is the e-mail from Jim on the subject. I convinced Jim that this type of modeling effort is our gig and he completely agrees. As per Jim's suggestion, he and I will talk more on the product while we are in Denver. I suspect that we will arrange for the vendor to come to Houston and do a presentation on the product and install the product on our machines. As for additional development we should get John Bloomer and Jim together in a meeting and hash out the requirements from John Bloomer's perspective. Using Vince's analogy, this tool allows us to deternime the size of the cargo space needed for Fedex-like delivery (our streaming media products). Whereas, the optical light path switching (DS-3, OC-3, OC-12 and OC-48) based trading will reserve the underlying airline routes, etc. So the packet based stuff is looking at the required capacity from IP layer (Network and Transport: level 3 and 4) requirements. The optical light path is Level 1 & 2 based requirements. That is this tool will allow John Bloomer to size (actually we will do the analysis for him) the capacity requirement that he would need for the products that he is developing. That is my take on the difference, we'll find out otherwise. Once I finish off this discussion with Jim in Denver, I suggest putting Martin Lin on the job to find out more about the product and do the leg work to arrange for vendor demo and software installation. Martin will keep Samer and Chonawee updated on the information that he gathers.

"FYI: Note that the person mentioned in the text below (Ming Lung Lee) is very experienced in traditional traffic engineering work. He comes from MCI where he was responsible for modeling traffic etc. It appears that Sycamore finally got him. One time they had lost him to Corvis (another optical equipment company), I guess Sycamore went back to him with a better deal! As soon as this guy is available, I'll set up an all day technical meeting to hash out what needs to be done as far as optimization algorithm development is concerned. I want to produce a technical requirement document to clearly outline what needs to be done to support dynamic, optical-switched-circuits based trading and streaming media applications, etc. Having such an industry expert help us will help 'justify' internally all the the effort on the traffic analysis side that John Griebling has asked us to support. Keep in mind that even though he is an expert in the field, the field that we need to play in has not develop yet. Even the emerging data based traffic (as opposed to voice where blocking of traffic is allowed) analysis is an order of magnitude more difficult (due to uncertain load), let alone trading such load (which we are planning to do!). Ravi. ... Sycamore hired a guy per Griebling's request, to work with you on the design/planning piece of the business. He will be contracted out to Enron for a period of 6 months initially.

"Hi Stinson, as per our discussion, which we will expand upon when we meet later today, my currently role in Hamachi is better characterize as combination of deal support (from the engineering perpsective), facilitating my work with Jean Mrha (via Erik Simpson) on the initial load forecast and general requirements document development. None of this is technical by any means. If anything, it is more like engineering consulting (from deal perspective) by EBS Research to John's group. I will bring it up with John tomorrow night about bringing our technical guys on such road trips so that they can get involved with his group even though no optimization modeling work may need to be done. For this I will use Samer and/or Chonawee but we need to be certain that they are available on such on-call basis as stated below. John is very clear and specific about who he ask to be at such meeting and when, etc. Normally he does not want any deviations. So if we put someone on such jobs, they have to be able to travel on-call anywhere, any place. That is the time pressure he is working with.

"Hi Stinson, as per our discussion, here is the e-mail from Jim on the subject. I convinced Jim that this type of modeling effort is our gig and he completely agrees. As per Jim's suggestion, he and I will talk more on the product while we are in Denver. I suspect that we will arrange for the vendor to come to Houston and do a presentation on the product and install the product on our machines. As for additional development we should get John Bloomer and Jim together in a meeting and hash out the requirements from John Bloomer's perspective. Using Vince's analogy, this tool allows us to deternime the size of the cargo space needed for Fedex-like delivery (our streaming media products). Whereas, the optical light path switching (DS-3, OC-3, OC-12 and OC-48) based trading will reserve the underlying airline routes, etc. So the packet based stuff is looking at the required capacity from IP layer (Network and Transport: level 3 and 4) requirements. The optical light path is Level 1 & 2 based requirements. That is this tool will allow John Bloomer to size (actually we will do the analysis for him) the capacity requirement that he would need for the products that he is developing. That is my take on the difference, we'll find out otherwise. Once I finish off this discussion with Jim in Denver, I suggest putting Martin Lin on the job to find out more about the product and do the leg work to arrange for vendor demo and software installation.

It has been four years since the first edition was published. During this hiatus, a lot has happened as risk management within the rapidly expanding energy industry has come of age as a respected discipline. The second edition is a rich compilation of papers by a surprisingly representative group of industry leaders, practitioners and academics.

It has been four years since the first edition was published. During this hiatus, a lot has happened as risk management within the rapidly expanding energy industry has come of age as a respected discipline. The second edition is a rich compilation of papers by a surprisingly representative group of industry leaders, practitioners and academics. The books strength is that it reinforces the fact that risk management principles initially applied to a narrow band of energy commodities can and should be applied across a wide array of energy commodities including electricity. As expected the book does a solid job in capturing an international perspective on the various challenges, which are not isolated to any one continent but are global in scope.

We could expand the 2:30pm Friday meeting to include all interested EBS=20 people and discuss the topics below. Could Shalesh coordinate this meeting= =20 and also coordinate the ongoing effort firm-wide? Have I omitted anything= =20 below? As I see it, here are the key storage initiatives that EBS should undertake= ,=20 and who is involved up to this point.=20 1. - establish storage contract terms and pricing Who's involved: Virawan, Jean Mrha Beach a. define terms for storage needed for EBS products (MediaCast,=20 MediaTransport, and new products) b. define general terms for other storage contracts 2. - establish storage pooling points (SPP) Who's involved: Shalesh, Richard Reichardt, Mark Palmer, Kara Knop Who's needed: other designated people from Bloomer and Griebling groups, Ji= m=20 Crowder's group input on alliances a. define technology needed servers, storage devices control software for physical delivery b. decide optimal SPP locations at/near existing bandwidth trading pooling points at/near existing EBS city PoPs at a hosting partner location c. engage optimal partners to create SPP IBM IBM Global Services Tivioli (storage management software) EMC Sun Compaq existing storage portal vendors (e.g. Storage Networks) 3. - establish storage trading benchmark Who's involved: unknown Who's needed:",mark.palmer@enron.com,ravi.thuraisingham@enron.com,"'Ravi' : 'person', 'Shalesh' : 'person', 'Virawan' : 'person', 'Jean Mrha Beach' : 'person', 'Shalesh' : 'person', 'Richard Reichardt' : 'person', 'Mark Palmer' : 'person', 'Kara Knop' : 'person'",8,EBS's approach to storage trading,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,received,ravi.thuraisingham@enron.com

"Ravi, It's fine with me. I think the expense is justified (as it's equal to the cost of the alternative). Vince Ravi Thuraisingham@ENRON COMMUNICATIONS on 03/09/2000 12:44:01 PM To: Stinson Gibner/HOU/ECT@ECT, Vince Kaminski cc: Subject: Mountaintop Meetings Next Week FYI, I may have to stay over weekend. Vince, if that is the case, I may have to bring my wife or allow her to go to her sister for a week etc. I may ask John to cover some of that cost as (I think) he is done with other people. I've seen other guys family members showup. This cost would equal what EBS would have spend to send me home and bring me back again, etc. Ravi. ----- Forwarded by Ravi Thuraisingham/Enron Communications on 03/09/00 12:36 PM ----- Jeanette Busse 03/09/00 10:16 AM To: Dayne Relihan/Enron Communications@Enron Communications, Dorn Hetzel/Enron Communications@Enron Communications, Jeanette Busse/Enron Communications@Enron Communications, Jim Irvine/Enron Communications@Enron Communications, John Bloomer/Enron Communications@Enron Communications, John Griebling/Enron Communications@Enron Communications, Kelly Williams/Enron Communications@Enron Communications, Kenny Burroughs/Enron Communications@Enron Communications, Kevin Kohnstamm/Enron Communications@Enron Communications, Laura Beneville/Enron Communications@Enron Communications, Phil Sisneros/Enron Communications@Enron Communications, Ravi Thuraisingham/Enron Communications@Enron Communications, Rob Kolosvary/Enron Communications@Enron Communications, Scott Smith/En",vince.kaminski@enron.com,ravi.thuraisingham@enron.com,"'Ravi Thuraisingham' : 'person', 'Stinson Gibner' : 'person', 'Vince Kaminski' : 'person', 'Ravi Thuraisingham' : 'person', 'Jeanette Busse' : 'person', 'Dayne Relihan' : 'person', 'Dorn Hetzel' : 'person', 'Jeanette Busse' : 'person', 'Jim Irvine' : 'person', 'John Bloomer' : 'person', 'John Griebling' : 'person', 'Kelly Williams' : 'person', 'Kenny Burroughs' : 'person', 'Kevin Kohnstamm' : 'person', 'Laura Beneville' : 'person', 'Phil Sisneros' : 'person', 'Ravi Thuraisingham' : 'person', 'Rob Kolosvary' : 'person', 'Scott Smith' : 'person'",19,Re: Mountaintop Meetings Next Week,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,received,ravi.thuraisingham@enron.com
