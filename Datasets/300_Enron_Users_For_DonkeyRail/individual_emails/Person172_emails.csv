Below I am copying a summary prepared by Andy Brown who covers these matters for IEP. It appears that the CAISO proposal will allow for SC's to go short or long in the R/T market (i.e., final schedules do not need to be balanced). That's good. I think the most material issue at this point is how the forward capacity requirement (ACAP, akin to ICAP) will affect our trading. GAC What is CAISO proposing? First off, there are ""target price"" and ""intra-zonal congestion management"" FERC filings that are apparently almost ready for a drop at FERC. The ""comprehensive"" package would build off that. In essencence, CAISO is proposing a capacity market (similar to what IEP proposed at the CPUC ""Procurement OIR"") that has an ""available capacity obligation"" (ACAP) on the load-serving entities (LSE",bill.williams@enron.com,ryan.slinger@enron.com,"'Comnes, Alan' : 'person', 'Comnes, Alan' : 'person', 'Belden, Tim' : 'person', 'Badeer, Robert' : 'person', 'Mallory, Chris' : 'person', 'Lackey, Chris' : 'person', 'Richter, Jeff' : 'person', 'Hall, Steve C.' : 'person', 'Blair, Kit' : 'person', 'Gilbert, Scotty' : 'person', 'Williams III, Bill' : 'person', 'Calger, Christopher F.' : 'person', 'Heizenrader, Tim' : 'person', 'Foster, Chris H.' : 'person', 'Steffes, James D.' : 'person', 'Dasovich, Jeff' : 'person', 'Novosel, Sarah' : 'person', 'Andy Brown' : 'person'",18,FW: California ISO Market Re-Design 2002 (MD02),1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,received,ryan.slinger@enron.com

The boss, Kenneth Lay, was a friend of the current president of these United States, an adviser to his administration and one of his biggest financial backers.
