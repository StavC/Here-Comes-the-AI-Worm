This means that no one can disclose to another bidder or any other person: the name of any bidder, the number of bidders, any questions asked, or comments made, by any bidder. If you have any questions regarding a confidentiality issue, or any other issue please contact me or Ben or Stuart Zisman. Please highlight this with the plant managers as well Site Visit Procedures The attached Site Visit Procedures and cover letter were distributed to the Round II bidders last week. Please read them carefully and to the extent a bidder moves outside of them, remind them of the procedures and have the bidder redirect the question to our banker, Credit Suisse First Boston. Should you have any questions, please call me. Also, you should have received a copy of the Information Memorandum that went out to all of the bidders. If you don't have a copy, please call me and I will forward. I have also attached a copy of the presentation which each bidder will view online. Please review both so that we can be consistent in our message. Our internal site visit procedures will be as follows.

"All of you continue to play a key role in the success of the sale of the Peakers, LVI & II and Pastoria. A number of different parties are currently reviewing the book. Since we haven't had a chance to gather as a group recently, I thought it might be beneficial to send out an email highlighting the schedule over the next several weeks and months. This week and next, we will be finalizing the due diligence room, the terms of the purchase and sale agreements (PSA), the management presentation and a lot of other stuff. First round bids due a week from this Friday, on Sept. 29. The week of Oct. 2, we will be notifying those bidders that will advance to Round 2 and we will be sending out the PSA. The week of Oct. 9, the real fun will begin with management presentations, due diligence room opening and site visits. The key people involved in these activities should work to keep their schedules as flexible as possible from Oct. 9 - Nov 3. We need to think about who can do plant tours, give presentations, etc given that the most logical people may be giving the management presentation, answering questions, and/or unavailable to lead the plant tour. It is our hope and expectations that we will have multiple bidders to juggle in this process. It is going to be a balancing act and I encourage everyone to begin to think through people and process. The schedule then has us selecting our preferred purchaser(s) the week of Nov. 6, with a December 18, 2000 closing!

We came away with a broad T&M outline. One concern that Kevin raised is our ability to actually do a ""services agreement"" for the risk management and back offices aspect of NewCo. Apparently, he said a number of issues have bubbled up recently with our systems in terms of manpower, age of system, and ability to take on additional load. He said throwing on an incremental 4000-5000 MWs with NewCo may prove to be too much to handle. He also raised the ""confidentiality issue"". It is his view that NewCo should have this capability in-house anyway (obviously that was always the long term intent, with this services agreement more a bridge). Several options exist. 1. Force a 12-24 month services agreement through the system (solve our problems with more people, etc). 2.

The meetings were productive, and we are making progress. Lew has instructed these guys to get down into a lot of detail on the business plan/core competencies, which we did! They also floated the valuation of their existing assets - $3.1B for 3947 MWs or $789/kW. We walked them through our peaker valuation as well. We didn't debate the valuations, but rather we decided to go ahead and have Clement and Jinsung try to pull together a consolidated model for NewCo. That is being done, and should be ready Monday/Tuesday. It is apparent from these meetings that they are looking for ENRON to provide several key pieces to NewCo (other than peakers and dev. projects): 1. Enron culture and emphasis on intellectual capital (including HR approach). 2. Trading and marketing expertise. 3. Enron style finance. 4. Select management spots. 5. Supplement development team.

"Don - Please forward on to Allegheny. In order to facilitate the smooth transfer of the assets, to close out the turbine purchase contracts, and to provide Allegheny with unused generation capability at Gleason, we are entering into an agreement with Siemens Westinghouse Power Corp (""SWPC"") which will effect the Gleason and Wheatland facilities in the following way. 1. Increase the permissible power level at Gleason on each of the turbines from 182mw to 185mw. Specifically, SWPC will allow the three Gleason units to each have a maximum operating capability of 185,000kw and will reset the control curves accordingly. SWPC further will agree that operation of the Gleason units up to and including 185,000 kw is within normal operating parameters and operation up to and including this level will not invalidate the warranty. SWPC has agreed to make this change within one week after we give them authorization. 2. SWPC agrees that the Gleason and Wheatland contracts and associated warranties may be assigned to limited liability companies owned in whole or in part by an Enron entity pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Gleason and Wheatland contracts, and that SWPC's consent to such assignments will not be unreasonably withheld. SWPC will honor warranty claims currently outstanding or asserted in the future by the contract assignee, assuming such assignment is in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Gleason and Wheatland contracts. 3. SWPC agrees to assist Enron in providing technical information, ",mitch.robinson@enron.com,don.miller@enron.com,'Don' : 'person',1,SWPC Transfer,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,received,don.miller@enron.com
"Don: The questions that I was unable to answer for Excelon (PECO) during the Lincoln site visit are as follows: 1. What is the gas consumption per unit during start-up? 2. What is the reference # for the 2nd ComEd Interconnection Feasibility Study? Is this document on deal bench? 3. Do any other parties have a right to interconnect to the Project's gas pipeline lateral? My input to these questions is: 1. None. I am not familiar with this area. 2. I saw this 2nd study is out on deal bench at least a week ago. As long as it wasn't removed, it should be there. I do not know the reference #. 3. I do not believe that any other parties have a right to connect to the gas lateral owned by Des Plaines LLC. (In fact, I believe that we are statutorily prevented from supplying gas to other end users - Des Plaines LLC is neither an interstate pipeline nor a gas LDC). Please confirm my opinion with Stuart/Chris Meyer to make sure that we have not granted any interconnection rights to Northern Border/Peoples. Call me to discuss.
