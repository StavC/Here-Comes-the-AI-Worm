"Kay, Ader and I met with NJ Natural Gas earlier this week to discuss fuel cell opportunities in NJ. As a gas supplier in NJ, these guys are very interested in developing some fuel cell projects as a means to increase throughput on their system. They also have a strong relationship with the state commission (called the Board of Public Utilities, I think) and there are green funds available to subsidize costs, etc. Sound familiar? I need to get a CA to these guys and I am forwarding to you the one we signed with CRRA. I like this one because there is an exclusivity clause in it.

"Kay and Reagan, We have an opportunity (VERY, VERY preliminary) to supply full requirements to a co-op that is breaking away from Old Dominion Electric Cooperative (ODEC) that is located in VEPCO's territory. They have about 500 MW peak load and 200 MW of resources, everything else is covered by VEPCO. If we got back our queue spot, we could build our peaker (within VEPCO's territory) to meet this load. Kay, what is your opinion on the strength of our argument with VEPCO? We may have a new deal that makes building the peaker viable again and so we may want to push them on it. Doctor, do we have a pulse? It may be the death of me, but we're going to build that peaker!

"Nothing fatal. Here are some thoughts/comments on the AMA for your general consideration: 2.2 (d) Bank accounts/bookkeeping. I've previously been advised that Corp performs this function. Issues which arise: will the money be invested overnight, who has signature authority, etc. We have a draft services agreement prepared for Peoples which can serve as a ""go by"" if you decide you need a separate doc. 2.2 (b)Billing/collection. Responsibility generally should stop at sending nastygrams. No duty to hire lawyers, etc. 2.2 (f) Insurance. In Texas, you have to have licenses to buy/sell insurance and adjust claims. Current language may be soft enough to not violate licensing laws. 2.2 (g) cost of filing for licenses and permits not included in defn of Marketing Expenses, but there's some catch all language that might help. 2.3 Accountants may like it to be clear that we can't hire/fire O & M contractor, set O & M policies, or dispatch plant. 3.2 If there are multiple transactions in a short period, these may be captured in one document, not one document for each transaction. It would be helpful if the EEIM for use with others explains our agency role. (may be in there - didn't review a copy) Is the Owner a power marketer yet?

"I'll check. Thanks for the help. Kay Heather Kroll@ECT 03/05/2001 06:39 PM To: Kay Mann/Corp/Enron@Enron cc: Subject: Paige Update CKM, I spoke to Althea Gordon in the Recruiting Dept today regarding the poor treatment Paige received in the recruiting process. Here is her response. First of all, Paige should have received a rejection letter and a hold letter. The rejection letter was from her submittal to the analyst process on her own. The hold letter supposedly says that, based on referrals, she is on a waiting list and will be contacted for interviews provided there is any space left in the summer analyst class. Basically they have offers out to what they call ""first-tier"" schools and are waiting for responses. If they have any spots left, they will interview any candidates that are ""on hold"" based on resume review. I asked why she didn't merit an interview right out of the gate and she told me it was because she was from a smaller school where we don't normally recruit and she lacked experience in Enron industries (sounded like a canned answer to me). Will you check with Paige and see if she did get this ""hold"" letter? I want to push to at least get her an interview, but am sensitive to making too big a deal about it and hurting her chances more than helping them. I'll also talk to Charlene Jackson who runs the Analyst and Associate program and see if she has any advice.
