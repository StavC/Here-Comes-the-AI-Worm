Should we fail to close this transaction, we should look to our potential alternatives for withdrawing from the fund, unless of course we view that we will close but it will happen over the few days following. Interestingly, AIG may be planning to use further funds raised to create a second fund rather than add to the current fund leaving us with more of a percentage ownership but less capability of accessing the deals (fuel supply, despatch and EPC rights would not be attached to any second fund). We also have far too many people talking to AIG now and we need to stop this immediately, going forward only Joe Deffner should communicate with Bob as at the moment we have too many people doing all of the work for AIG for no return. As of Friday or the close of Alamac - Bob can only talk through Joe. We are not in the business of doing work for this fund. Can you put together (only if we fail to close) a short review for John of why we should stay in the fund over removing ourselves. I recognize that contractually we have no capability of exiting at this point but I know you think differently and I hope you are right.

"John, Happy New Year!! I wish you and your family the best and as Dina puts it...BUY LOW, SELL HIGH (lol). I have a great deal of songs to send you. Just look at the lists (you can open it with Wordpad) and let me know wich ones you like or if you prefer I will send them all to you. Also, I wont be able to send them via e-mail (too big in memory size). Therefore, check to see if your IT group have an IOmega Zip Drive (100 MB) so that I can mail the songs to you.
