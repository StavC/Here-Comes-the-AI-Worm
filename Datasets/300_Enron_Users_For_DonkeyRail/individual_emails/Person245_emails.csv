"Thanks for the summary. I was out last week so apologies if my comments arrive too late. Here they are anyway: 1 Socrates I think it inappropriate for me, or anyone in RAC for that matter, to have primary responsibility for this system/project. But if I were responsible the first thing I would want to know is why this project, which commenced in May 1998, as I recall, is still incomplete, given that it now contains possibly the largest energy derivative position in history, concentrated in a single commodity with a single counterpart. 2 Exhaustive ? It doesn't look like an exhaustive list and I suspect it was not intended to be so - nevertheless we should ensure it is not viewed as such. 3 Symptoms or Causes ? Many of the points look like the former, and addressed as they stand will likely leave us with a Band-aid solution which will drop off when pressure is applied. In fact many of them look like they are a result of Point 5 : ""Prioritisation of system projects has resulted in a lack of certain control functionality..."" because that explains partly why models get built and forgotten, confirmation errors get made, deliveries go astray and trades get missed - usually bright people are simply too immersed in manual processes to have time to think about changing the way they work.

"In my response to Brent Price on the London Doorstep review I alluded to the incompleteness of the list of issues. As I outlined, the key point has been identified, but its knock - on effects are widespread and worrying, especially as they concern the Continental Power operation: As of today the most recent finalised DPR for this business was for 11th May, and during the period between then and now we have seen (although in milder form) a repeat of the turmoil on the Amsterdam Power Exchange (APX) that we witnessed in January this year. This is not the time or the market to not know our position. The business is soon to apply for higher limits to accommodate a new transaction on the Polish border. I am bound to comment that based on the state it appears to be in, I would not recommend higher limits. To add insult to injury, as a result of the way this area has been allowed to develop, much of the know-how is in the heads (and spreadsheets) of certain key individuals who it seems are now bound rapidly for EBS. UK Gas seems to have slipped too. Yesterday they reported a $7m loss due to the value of a set of options which were part of a structured deal, booked ""off-system"" and not revalued for over a month.

"Stan, feedback as follows: Does the candidate posess the required technical skills to be successful in this job? Clearly has an appropriate background to support the role - able to talk sensibly about the science of market risk (value at risk, options etc.) and the art too (culture and interplay between front, middle, back office). Perhaps a little light on some of the finer points of a VAR - based metric, and I did not delve into the nuances of the oil transportation world. Does the candidate possess the necessary leadership and teamwork skills and behaviors? Does the candidate possess the necessary communication skills (internal & external)? I liked his style - calm, collected, succinct. Professional but with some humour (!). Body language was open and will facilitate good rapport. Strong personality which at times made me feel I was the interviewee, but I think that could be a good thing here. I think he will be able to build good relationships, that support both the ""customer service"" and ""independent controller"" aspects of the CFO role down at EOTT.

"True, but the limits and associated P&L notifications relate to commodity groups rather than business units - they used to be the same. Unfortunately, where we have become more sophisticated and, as in this case legitimately hedge a natural exposure with some other commodity, the latter commodity (and associated P&L) gets counted in the commodity ""cut"". Loss notifications, especially, serve as a ""flag"", and provided the explanation makes sense and everyone who needs to make a decision about it, can do so, then it serves its purpose. The other upside is that when, sometime in the future, we have to refer back to an event, we have good ""institutional memory"".

"True, but the limits and associated P&L notifications relate to commodity groups rather than business units - they used to be the same. Unfortunately, where we have become more sophisticated and, as in this case legitimately hedge a natural exposure with some other commodity, the latter commodity (and associated P&L) gets counted in the commodity ""cut"". Loss notifications, especially, serve as a ""flag"", and provided the explanation makes sense and everyone who needs to make a decision about it, can do so, then it serves its purpose. The other upside is that when, sometime in the future, we have to refer back to an event, we have good ""institutional memory"".

"Thanks for the summary. I was out last week so apologies if my comments arrive too late. Here they are anyway: 1 Socrates I think it inappropriate for me, or anyone in RAC for that matter, to have primary responsibility for this system/project. But if I were responsible the first thing I would want to know is why this project, which commenced in May 1998, as I recall, is still incomplete, given that it now contains possibly the largest energy derivative position in history, concentrated in a single commodity with a single counterpart. 2 Exhaustive ? It doesn't look like an exhaustive list and I suspect it was not intended to be so - nevertheless we should ensure it is not viewed as such. 3 Symptoms or Causes ? Many of the points look like the former, and addressed as they stand will likely leave us with a Band-aid solution which will drop off when pressure is applied. In fact many of them look like they are a result of Point 5 : ""Prioritisation of system projects has resulted in a lack of certain control functionality..."" because that explains partly why models get built and forgotten, confirmation errors get made, deliveries go astray and trades get missed - usually bright people are simply too immersed in manual processes to have time to think about changing the way they work.

"Steve I have validated the curve shift data against the official internal daily position and p&l reports (which report total p&l) and am generally comfortable with the original curve-shift numbers. The differences betweeen the two are due to the following components of profit and loss, i.e. those which price moves against a day's closing position do not capture: 1 Intra day positioning (in the forward and cash markets) 2 New deals against our mid curve 3 Liquidity and other reserve movements 4 Liquidation (i.e. where forward mark-to-market value drops out of the forward book and into cash) The data set you have is the one we use to test the efficacy of our VaR models and I would be cautious in their use for predicting profitability. Hence total p&l is the best indicator since it includes all the value changes in the book. I imagine you are using some measure of return on risk to predict p&l (RoVaR, for example). We have done similar studies for presentation to our Board, amongst others. Let me know if this analysis would be useful to you - we would be happy to provide it.

"Thanks for your comments on the standards. Our approach in creating a global exception reporting mechanism is to start simply and build from there. Our initial cut is to have effective exception reporting on a handful of critical standards by the end of this year. That will be a first, to on a daily basis have a view into the exceptions outside the global standards. Many of the measurements that you mention are great management tools for accessing the level of excellence of the services that we are delivering and the competence of those that are managing these services. Some of these may be more appropriately contained in a monthly operations report that I have instituted within ENA and which we are working to proliferate across all of the wholesale merchant services companies. Give me a call and we can set a time to get together for a few minutes and I can review this operating report with you. We spent some time at our offsite in late October with all operations controllers reviewing and discussing these standards. Shona has taken a stab at the format of these exception reports. It is likely that we will have a rep from each of the operating companies participate in the final design of these reports, so that all feel as if they own the intended output from these reports. Yes, we are gleaning this information from those that are responsible for these activities. My purpose is not to use this info to punish or prosecute, but instead to use this exception report as a tool to garner resources as needed to clear the exceptions. It is invariably the deals that are exceptions in some way that create the problems.

"David, The business model you outline is actually the one we are implementing with one big difference - the Head Trader in London (Sam Hainsworth) calls the sales person each day to tell him what to do before they speak to any customers. As you point out, these conversations are recorded so if the sales person does anything other than what is agreed at the outset of each day, then they will be red carded. I refer you back to the memo supplementing the updated list of authorised traders that I sent out and which Marcelo and Sam have discussed with Commercial staff in both these offices (Shona and Bjorn have this memo), as well as Marcelo's operational plan. Clarification point - when Andy says ""internally"" he means that Commercial (Rob Soeldner) is taking a lead in resolving Joe Robertson's concerns.

I have discussed these changes with Rod Hayslett and he has concurred with my proposal. I have also reviewed them with Vlady . 1. VaR: Given that PGE is a naturally short utility and does not hedge its long-dated gas position for regulatory, liquidity and market view reasons, I propose that PGE reallocate $500k of its regulated electric VaR to its regulated natural gas VaR bring the gas VaR up to $2.5MM and reducing the electric VaR to $7.5mm. This change is necessary to account for the size of PGE's natural short position in the back-end of its reporting period. After reducing PGE's electric VaR it will still have sufficient capacity to manage the regulated electric portfolio. 2. NOP: After changing PGE's regulated gas VaR to $2.5MM it will be necessary to change the corresponding net open position. Currently PGE has been using a 10 Bcf limit for its NOP and Maturity Gap.
