"FYI, I do not send out a written offer package until the verbal offer issues are resolved and a final offer is made.

He's sitting on the fence for some good reasons, and he has to weigh what is fairly comfy job situation for one that starts out at a lower level but has more potential. WRT the GREEN, Vince verbally offered salary of $105k plus a guarantee that his bonus at year end would be a minimum of $15k cash. That's in addition to the $15k sign on bonus. Vince said that we would not bother working up a revised offer letter unless and until Rabi came back with a verbal ok. He will ponder the offer; probably for a few more days and get back with us. He may well call you to discuss the exact details of the benefits.

Toni, I would like to bring two people for an interview One of them sent me a message that is attached below. I am including the info about the 2nd gentleman below. I would like to include myself, Vasant Shnabhogue, Tanya Tamarchenko Stinson Gibner, Zimin Lu, Paulo Issler, Alex Tang on the interview list. It would be great if we could bring them this week on Friday. Tanya will be at a training course next week. This means that if Friday this week is too aggressive, we should shoot for interviews in 2 weeks. Sorry for a short notice.

"Toni, We shall be meeting Rabi for lunch to discuss the offer and the details of his job with him. Let's wait for the outcome of this discussion. Vince Enron North America Corp.

So, I'd like to put the details below in writing and send out to him for Tuesday delivery. I'm playing phone tag with him regarding the other details and will follow up with him again in the morning.

He's sitting on the fence for some good reasons, and he has to weigh what is fairly comfy job situation for one that starts out at a lower level but has more potential. WRT the GREEN, Vince verbally offered salary of $105k plus a guarantee that his bonus at year end would be a minimum of $15k cash. That's in addition to the $15k sign on bonus. Vince said that we would not bother working up a revised offer letter unless and until Rabi came back with a verbal ok.
