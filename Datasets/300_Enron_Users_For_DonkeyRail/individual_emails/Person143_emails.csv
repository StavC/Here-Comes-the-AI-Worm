Electricity: The predominance of electricity usage occurs in states that are either several years away from enacting deregulation or where the rules are insufficiently determined at this time to even estimate an opening date. When opening dates are more clearly defined and we have confidence in energy curves for those markets, then we could revisit this area of your energy profile. Natural Gas: Bunge has taken the initiative to engage in several longer term supply and transporation agreements which have effectively managed your price/therm.

"A quick summary of the NYMEX meeting I attended on August 10. 1. eNYMEX NYMEX has begun developing an internet based trading system to replace Access and to handle basis trading. The system is targeted to launch some time during Q4 2000. The basis products that might be traded are Nymex swap, AECO (C$/gj fxd/float), Transco Z6, Chicago City Gate, Houston Ship Channel. 2. TAS Overwhelming support of the TAS pilot program from trade players with locals opposed. A motion was passed to add expiration day to the current TAS pilot program. The motion is to be presented to the NYMEX board in the next few weeks. 3. AGA data release Favorable comments regarding the 1pm release of the weekly storage data. 4. Sabine Hub discounts Sabine is considering offering some discount through the Hub for volume commitment.

"Scott-- Something for you to consider: If the transport people are to have their own books, my belief is that the curve setting used for the transport values ought to be as unbiased as possible. This means using as few ""formula based"" curves as possible and as many Gas Daily publication postings as possible. I'm not sure how you or your traders feel about the following postings, (how realistic they are), but I think they bear watching to see if they could be used for calculating transport p&l. In Gas Daily, under Citygate, Pooling Point Prices, there are Mid Atlantic Citygates postings for both CNG and Columbia Gas. These could potentially be used for CNG North & South Citygates and TCO citygates. The only thing I have to confirm is how these would load since there is no index posted each day--it is a range of prices instead. Historically TCO and CNG citygate postings haven't been much of an issue because we haven't held much transport on CNG and TCO, but with the CES business in our portfolio, the times have changed. Currently we are using ""formula based"" curves set by the traders to calculate CNG and TCO transport p&l, and there sure seems to be a huge difference between the postings and how we are marking the curves. For example, today's Gas Daily postings compared to our curve markings are as follows: GAS DAILY GAS DAILY SPREAD SPREADS per TRADERS CURVES TCO pool $2.985 $1.565 $.10 TCO citygate $4",colleen.sullivan@enron.com,scott.neal@enron.com,'Scott' : 'person',1,Transport formula settles,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,received,scott.neal@enron.com

"Scott, Please see the message below from Neil Davies. Neil works in HR under David Oxley and was instructed to call Mr. Reitze last night. I asked him not to mention the dinner with you. A problem that is coming up is that the interviews are required to run late (8:30ish) and the person that has been pushed to the end of that line is Hunter. What are your thoughts on this and is him going to dinner with the two of you a possibility at all? If you need me to help with reservations or anything, please let me know as I would be happy to help. Also note that Greg Whalley would like to meet with him. Eddie does not want to come in any earlier than 4. That can be a problem. Maybe another thought is to have him come in twice, but I am afraid if we pick that option, it may be tough to get him back.

"According to Kimat, TP2 gets the NYPA sale at Mamou at the prices show below. We have 3 options on serving this deal: 1) buy Texas Gas capacity and ship the gas on a secondary basis from the Zone SL Pool 2) use Transco Zone 3 wellhead 3) buy Trco capacity and ship the gas on a secondary basis from St 65 Most of the time we use option #1. Texas Gas is cheaper than Trco even after paying the transport cost. However, this deal comes to the TP2 book at the prices listed below. For April, TP2 purchased the gas from GULF2 at the Zone SL IF + $.005 and shipped it to Mamou. The total transport cost is $.02 (including demand - this changes each month). We don't arb the supply with Trco and Texas Gas because NYPA is extremely difficult to work with and this is a term firm sale to NYPA. Should we change the mid price for the NYPA to include both the Zone SL mid price and the transport expense? ---------------------- Forwarded by Chris Germany/HOU/ECT on 03/27/2001 03:21 PM --------------------------- Kimat Singla 03/08/2001 12:54 PM To: Chris Germany/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: Subject: Re: Sale to NYPA At TGT/ZSL mid i.e. Index 5.01 Other fee .01 Physical Prem .005 Total 5.025 Questions, please call.
