"As you know, Ken has talked to Larry Summers about serving on Enron's Board of Directors. Larry told Ken that in light of his selection to head Harvard, he wants to hold off going on any corporate boards for now. My understanding is that Larry will most likely accept Ken's offer at the end of the year. In the meantime, let me suggest a candidate for Enron's Advisory Committee. Lee Sachs was Assistant Secretary of Treasury for Financial Markets under Bob Rubin and Larry. Lee coordinated the energy negotiations for Larry at the end of the Clinton Administration. You probably met Lee at those meetings. Lee is brilliant. He was a Managing Director at Bear Sterns before joining the Treasury team. He is a huge fan of Enron and is constantly telling me how extremely well positioned Enron is for the future. He has done considerable research on our business model and is constantly talking to his buddies on Wall Street about us. Lee will undoubtedly be a significant player in any future Democratic Administration. I know he would be an invaluable addition to this Committee. He has not decided what he is going to do next, but has several extremely good offers on the table from large investment firms and hedge funds. None of these would conflict with this type of activity. I thought I would plant this suggestion with you not knowing exactly how these things are done.",linda.robertson@enron.com,steven.kean@enron.com,"'Ken' : 'person', 'Larry Summers' : 'person', 'Ken' : 'person', 'Lee Sachs' : 'person', 'Bob Rubin' : 'person'",5,Suggestion for Advisory Committee,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,sent,linda.robertson@enron.com

"Yes. We talked this morning, and I am pleased with the results. We talked about integrating our offices fully. We agreed that I would put together an office seat assignment chart, which would move John and his folks into our section of the office. This will allow us to more fully integrate our activities on a daily if not hourly means. We also talked about how John and Tom should think about our involvement on international issues. Our basic framework, which will need further definition, is to consolidate Joe Hillings activities into John's and Tom's portfolios. By that I see John handling project based activity and Tom predominantly handling international legislative issues. There will of course be overlap but I think the friction we have seen in the office to date should be mitigated with this approach. Tom has a very full plate, and even with our new hires, I do not see Tom's domestic (such as energy and commodities) activities dropping off that much. This too should lessen friction. John and I also talked about consolidating our budgets. I explained to him how that has worked to date with Joe Hartsoe's group. John and I also discussed our outside counsel in the international arena, including McLarty. John thought Mac could be very helpful to us and that we can better focus Mac's assignments. We also discussed that I planned to end or multilaterize the Hills Co. engagement at the end of March.

"Here are possible Q's. Dan W. will prepare first cut at answers. Questions for January 31 Hearing Price Gouging ? On January 22, your company reported fourth-quarter results for 2000, in which you showed that profits from your energy trading unit rose 256 percent and your overall earnings rose 34 percent. How much of this was attributable to increased sales in California? How much did you make from sales in California? ? What is the highest per kilowatt-hour price Enron charged on the spot market? What is the cost of production for that power? ? In a recent Houston Chronicle article (January 23, 2001), Mr. Skilling, your CEO was quoted as saying that not only had the California situation not had an impact on earnings, but that ""it may even turn out to be a benefit in the long run."" Can you please explain the long-term benefits you expect? ? In a recent New York Times column by Paul Krugman, Ken Lay was quoted as saying that California consumers ""need to see the price signals that is, pay much more and start modifying behavior to reduce demand until we get more supplies."" What did Mr. Lay mean by this? With the tremendous profits that Enron is making in this situation, isn't it pretty brazen for him to be suggesting that California consumers should pay more for their power? Market Manipulation ? A number of generators and wholesalers, including Enron, have been accused of withholding energy to drive up energy prices in the Western states.

"Rick Richard sent an Email to you of 1/5/0l recommending support of Daryl Owen and Don Santa for positions with the Department of Energy. Steve Kean asked that we give you background on these candidates, and Joe Hartsoe and Cynthia Sandherr significantly contributed to this response. In sum, Don Santa is an excellent candidate for the DOE and has a well established record supporting competition in the gas and electric industries. Daryl Owen, while a strong candidate, has a less established record on competition. Daryl Owen, Principal at Hooper Owen and Winburn seeks the position of Deputy Secretary at DOE. He is a Democrat from Louisiana who is a family friend of Rick Richard's. He formerly served as an Energy Legislative Assistant and Administrative Assistant to Senator J. Bennett Johnston (D-LA) from 1981-86; and Staff Director, Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources from 1986-1990. He has been with first Hooper, Hooper and Owen and now Hoper Owen and Winburn since he left the Hill. His partner, Lindsay Hooper, was former Tax Legislative Assistant and Legislative Director to Senator Malcolm Wallop (R-WY), 1980-1984. Other partners include former Congressman Charlie Wilson (D-TX). Daryl's current clients include Duke Energy, Entergy Corp., Entergy Services, Inc., Japan Nuclear Cycle Development Institute, TECO Energy, United Pan Europe and Waste Control Specialists, Inc..

"This is a very helpful memo. I think you've hit the highlights of what we need to do. We will take the lead on the five page presentation. As for item #1, I agree. Sarah will have a better idea on Tuesday what resources we need in DC. As for the regional folks, I think we do want to balance time spent in DC with time spent on item #2. Both are important. Use of outside counsel will also need to be judged as we move forward. As for #3, we are organizing the outreach here. We clearly have much more to do on that front. Janel is putting together a list of companies who might be interested in joining a NE RTO support coalition. We will work with these groups to coordinate a message. Two final thoughts. 1) We need to organize a similar effort for the Southeast, where I suspect state opposition will be even stronger, and 2) We need to coordinate closely on all documents used in these proceedings or with outside policy makers. It is important that we have careful internal review. Thanks for taking the lead on coordinating our game plan.

"I have always found it useful in preparing for congressional hearings to have ""Hearing Themes."" The themes represent both the points we want to make in our written testimony and the points we should try to emphasize in our oral answers to Member questions. Please feel free to edit. Here is a first cut: I. The energy problems in California are of its own making and ultimately will require action by the State government. The State did not deregulate in 1996, it misregulated. II. In the short-term, California must provide support to the Utilities to maintain reliability as they are doing with the California Department of Water Resources purchases and the Utilities' financial problems resulting from their inability to recover power costs should be addressed immediately by the State. III. For the long-term, California should: --Increase supply and reduce demand --Bring retail rates in line with the cost of a reasonable portfolio of electricity supply --Allow customers to benefit stable long-term contracts --Not abandon its commitment to foster retail competition. (Here we should explain what we mean by each point and suggest solutions. Our explanation should not assume deep knowledge of the problem or the solutions.) IV. The California ""experience"" does not mean deregulation leads to higher prices for consumers and a lack of reliable supply. --The California crisis illustrates that true deregulation is the answer, misregulation is not. --There are ample illustrations of ""good"" state deregulation efforts. --Current Federal efforts to increase supply and decrease demand should be pursued. --Federal efforts to increase incentives for power generation should include regulator",linda.robertson@enron.com,"steven.kean@enron.com, richard.shapiro@enron.com, james.steffes@enron.com,

"This is an update of the Email below. With respect to DOE efforts to draft electricity legislation, a list of potential items for the bill are being discussed this afternoon with Secretary Abraham. DOE hopes to have a draft bill submitted to the White House by Friday, June 15, for consideration by the VP Task Force. Similar to efforts other private sector parties are undoubtedly taking, I would like to submit to DOE our suggestions for the legislation. As mentioned below, this bill will not include open access, but there are issues related to access which we may want to submit to DOE such as how to deal with non-jurisdictional entities. Other topics on which we may want to submit legislative language are PUHCA (the reporting requirements), interconnection, reliability, negawatts, RTO ownership issues, and eminent domain. DOE seem very willing to deal with the non-jurisdictional entities, either in the rulemaking context or by legislation. Tom Briggs will be following up with appropriate folks on this project. If you have any other ideas for this effort, please let us know ASAP.

"Rick Richard sent an Email to you of 1/5/0l recommending support of Daryl Owen and Don Santa for positions with the Department of Energy. Steve Kean asked that we give you background on these candidates, and Joe Hartsoe and Cynthia Sandherr significantly contributed to this response. In sum, Don Santa is an excellent candidate for the DOE and has a well established record supporting competition in the gas and electric industries. Daryl Owen, while a strong candidate, has a less established record on competition. Daryl Owen, Principal at Hooper Owen and Winburn seeks the position of Deputy Secretary at DOE. He is a Democrat from Louisiana who is a family friend of Rick Richard's. He formerly served as an Energy Legislative Assistant and Administrative Assistant to Senator J. Bennett Johnston (D-LA) from 1981-86; and Staff Director, Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources from 1986-1990. He has been with first Hooper, Hooper and Owen and now Hoper Owen and Winburn since he left the Hill. His partner, Lindsay Hooper, was former Tax Legislative Assistant and Legislative Director to Senator Malcolm Wallop (R-WY), 1980-1984. Other partners include former Congressman Charlie Wilson (D-TX). Daryl's current clients include Duke Energy, Entergy Corp., Entergy Services, Inc., Japan Nuclear Cycle Development Institute, TECO Energy, United Pan Europe and Waste Control Specialists, Inc..

"Steve: I intend to get the following email to Ken once he lands today in DC. Per our conference call last evening, we put together additional information on Administration appointments in preparation for Ken Lay's meeting with Clay Johnson. The post of Ambassador to India has garnered the interest of several candidates. Former Senator Larry Pressler has asked for support. Appended is an Email from Joe Hillings regarding the state of play on this nomination. I also check with Wade Cline in India about his reaction to Senator Pressler. Wade indicated that he does not know the Senator personally, but that ""he is well thought of in India and would be a good choice."" Please note from Joe's Email that Joe is concerned about a possible Pressler nomination. With respect to the SEC, Ken was asked to speak on behalf of James Doty from the law firm of Baker Botts. Appended is his bio. I checked with Ed Gillespie this morning about his latest information on SEC. Ed believes that Joe Grunfest of Stanford University is the leading candidate. No one has contacted us on behalf of Mr. Grunfest. In a recent Washington Post article, in addition to Doty, Rep. Chris Cox was mentioned as a possible candidate. Ed did not turn up Cox's name in his conversation with Administration officials today. I understand FERC candidates will also be discussed in the meeting. Ed Gillespie indicated this morning that ""Pat Wood is still the pick."" Ed also reported that Rep. Joe Barton is pushing Joe Kelliher for a potential slot.

"I have always found it useful in preparing for congressional hearings to have ""Hearing Themes."" The themes represent both the points we want to make in our written testimony and the points we should try to emphasize in our oral answers to Member questions. Please feel free to edit. Here is a first cut: I. The energy problems in California are of its own making and ultimately will require action by the State government. The State did not deregulate in 1996, it misregulated. II. In the short-term, California must provide support to the Utilities to maintain reliability as they are doing with the California Department of Water Resources purchases and the Utilities' financial problems resulting from their inability to recover power costs should be addressed immediately by the State. III. For the long-term, California should: --Increase supply and reduce demand --Bring retail rates in line with the cost of a reasonable portfolio of electricity supply --Allow customers to benefit stable long-term contracts --Not abandon its commitment to foster retail competition. (Here we should explain what we mean by each point and suggest solutions. Our explanation should not assume deep knowledge of the problem or the solutions.) IV. The California ""experience"" does not mean deregulation leads to higher prices for consumers and a lack of reliable supply. --The California crisis illustrates that true deregulation is the answer, misregulation is not. --There are ample illustrations of ""good"" state deregulation efforts. --Current Federal efforts to increase supply and decrease demand should be pursued. --Federal efforts to increase incentives for power generation should include regulator",linda.robertson@enron.com,"steven.kean@enron.com, richard.shapiro@enron.com, james.steffes@enron.com,

"Linda, Per our conversation today, I am emailing you the pertintent documents outlining our efforts in NY. The key document you will want to read through is the ESES Message Action Memo (it's about 15 pages and it details the comprehensive PR effort). The other important attachment is the Concept Board for the potential ad campaign. (THIS IS ONLY A CONCEPT BOARD AND WILL PROBABLY BE TWEAKED, BUT IT GIVES YOU AN IDEA OF HOW AN AD MIGHT LOOK/SOUND. THE PR FIRM SORT OF MIXES RETAIL AND WHOLESALE MAREKTS BUT WE CAN FIX THAT). I have left a message for Howard to call Jim D'Andrea, who has represented Keyspan at the coalition meetings, so that Jim knows you are calling his CEO. The coalition has been discussing this effort since Feb 1st. Edison Mission, Keyspan and Morgan Stanley want to contribute money only and remain anonymous (all for different reasons). They made their concerns known to the group from the start, but other companies hopped on that bandwagon last week. The take away from today's meeting (Keyspan was not present) was as follows: Our coalition is small (10 companies) If 3 companies are out front (enron, dynegy and mirant) and 7 companies only contribute and attempt to remain anonymous - the reporters will ignore our message and write the story about the ""anonymous donors""....not a good way to launch a coalition effort. We would also be ignoring the $42,000 of research we paid for which concluded that people want to hear from ""honest brokers"", they want to know who we",janel.guerrero@enron.com,linda.robertson@enron.com,"'Linda' : 'person', 'Howard' : 'person', 'Jim D'Andrea' : 'person'",3,URGENT - Documents for Keyspan Conversation,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,received,linda.robertson@enron.com

We need to take the opportunity, as soon as possible, to get a hard hitting, thoroughly researched and carefully written document in front of the Commissioners.

"I think these are quite good...the missing piece, I would argue, that we need to include is a talking point on the need for FERC to focus significant resources on the identification and elimination of market power in electricity markets and the need to encourage the development of distributed generation and more effective demand - side response mechanisms , partly in response to market power concerns. This is a huge issue in getting wholesale electricity markets to work effectively, i.e; to create discernable consumer welfare benefits.... and we ( Enron ) need to talk about this this issue and concern and talk about it frequently and w/ the same passion we talk about the need for open markets.

"Linda: I have revised my memo on Chris Hessler, my recommendation for the AA for Air slot at EPA, based on some recent developments. If you have forwarded on to Ken Lay, please send this new updated version. Because Gov. Whitman's credibility and clout in the White House has been damaged somewhat in the last week beacuse of the Bush announcement on CO2, her recommendation of Chris Hessler for this job may be taken less seriously. We are hearing that C. Boyden Gray's choice -- Jeff Holmstead -- is becoming a more serious candidate for the job, based on his more conservative credentials. Senator Inhofe's choice is no longer considered in the running at all. My recommendation is still that we back Hessler. We have nothing to lose: 1) we are supporting Whitman (which could help our initiatives at EPA). 2) we are supporting Hessler -- if he gets the job, we have a great relationship with the key EPA air person, if he doesn't, he's still the key Senate staffer on Clean Air and can help us tremendously.

"Thanks for the explanation. I agree, though I may not have explained the context adequately to Ken. Linda Robertson 05/11/2001 04:32 PM To: Steven J Kean/NA/Enron@Enron cc: Subject: Barton Bill You seemed troubled by the call to Barton. This bill may or may not be subsumed by the comprehensive energy bill that Congress undertakes this summer. Both bills have a very difficult, if not nearly impossible, path ahead given that the Democrats are in no mood for compromise. The call to Barton was to: a) repair relationships (and with the Wall Street Journal calling Barton about his troubled past with Enron, repair is needed); b) proclaim victory, even of a limited nature (something I think Enron has not done much of); c) build a further bond with Barton so we would have more input at full Committee (something we will need given the chances that this will go off the track are real); and d) allow Enron to get significant credit for the defeat of price caps. I hear from lots of DC sources that we have not had any success in the House Energy and Commerce Committee. Numerous folks at the markup noted in private conversations that this was Enron's first real role in the Committee. Thus, even though this is a very limited bill, the call made sense. I do not think that this means we should call the White House to push the bill with them. The bill itself still has lots of obstacles and many potential threats ahead.",steven.kean@enron.com,linda.robertson@enron.com,"'Ken' : 'person', 'Linda Robertson' : 'person', 'Steven J Kean' : 'person', 'Barton' : 'person', 'Barton' : 'person', 'Barton' : 'person', 'Barton' : 'person', 'Barton' : 'person'",8,Re: Barton Bill,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,received,linda.robertson@enron.com

We need to take the opportunity, as soon as possible, to get a hard hitting, thoroughly researched and carefully written document in front of the Commissioners.
