"There are only two ways that I can think of that would allow him to access the Financial Trading Agreements information if he is no longer with Enron: 1.) if A&K uses Notes and has been granted a connection to our network and are cross-certified to access the ecthou_ln1 server 2.) Jason has a desktop/laptop with Terminal Server Account access to our network and he continues to maintain an Enron NT account and Notes ID (or Cross-Certified A&K Notes ID). Please keep in mind, my Notes administration knowledge is a bit rusty and limited, but I'm pretty sure that this is the way it would have to work. In any case, remote access in this capacity should be coordinated through Information Risk Management/Notes Administration. I'm sure this is not very clear, maybe you can call me and we can discuss.

Also, I spoke with a contact in IRM and they said that the best way for Jason to keep is access would be to maintain his NT and Notes accounts and have him set up his Laptop/Desktop with a Terminal Server client. With this Terminal Server client he can access the Enron network as if he's in the office (a little/lot slower). To get Terminal Server: from his Enron Corp desktop he should click ""Start-Programs-Utilities-Make Terminal Server Client Disks"" - Then of course he needs to install TS on his machine at A&K (or home).

"There are only two ways that I can think of that would allow him to access the Financial Trading Agreements information if he is no longer with Enron: 1.) if A&K uses Notes and has been granted a connection to our network and are cross-certified to access the ecthou_ln1 server 2.) Jason has a desktop/laptop with Terminal Server Account access to our network and he continues to maintain an Enron NT account and Notes ID (or Cross-Certified A&K Notes ID). Please keep in mind, my Notes administration knowledge is a bit rusty and limited, but I'm pretty sure that this is the way it would have to work. In any case, remote access in this capacity should be coordinated through Information Risk Management/Notes Administration. I'm sure this is not very clear, maybe you can call me and we can discuss.
