"I just came from the House Ag. Committee where the interested parties have congregated throughout the negotiations today. Title I and Titles II are closed, which include the energy/metals exemption language. Tom Briggs and I have reviewed the latest draft (minus any changes made in pen by the staff) and the language critical to Enron titled ""Legal Certainty for Certian Transaction in Exempt Commodities"" is identical to that passed out of the House. This is satisfactory to us. We hope and expect (Speaker Hastert has commited to doing so) to have this included in the final end of the year omnibus appropriations legislation. Congress will likely vote on this legislative package on Friday. This could all come unraveled at this late date, but we are cautiously optomistic (George W's words yesterday afternoon...so maybe a good omen).

"201 Situation: Powell Goldstein called to clarify what the situation is after several misleading trade press articles indicated that the Administration was leaning against filing a Section 201 initiation. The Bottom Line is: the Administration is still very much undecided on how to proceed on a 201 investigation and even more undecided on which remedy to implement if harm is found. We have learned from Senior level officials they are considering the following options: Option 1: The Administration will initiate a Section 201 investigation on steel with an accompanying statement saying that the initiation does not in anyway indicate if and what remedy would be implemented. The threat to an Administration investigation, is that quotas are the expected remedy. By taking this approach, the Administration would allow the ITC to determine if the imports are trade related or a result of industry market structure, while placing a chilling effect on the possible implementation of quotas. The USTR supports this approach; the Department of Treasury has not been persuade it is prudent; the Department of Commerce is trying to negotiate the middle ground; and the White House is still undecided. Option 2: Allow the Senate Finance Committee to initiate a 201 investigation, but issue a similar statement indicating no remedy commitment. Timing: The EU-US Summit is meeting the second week of June and this will be on the agenda, so do not expect anything before June 14. The Senate Finance Committee is in transition after Sen. Jeffords switched parties and the Committees are being reformulated, which could take several weeks.

"This morning Enron was interviewed by the Federal Reserve, CFTC, SEC, and the Department of Treasury (also attending were the OCC and the FDIC). Scott Gahn from the commercial group lead the discussion and Vicki Sharp (legal), Mark Taylor (legal) and I supported Scott on the legal and regulatory issues. The goal in the meeting was to provide the agencies information so they can draft an interagency document on the retail swap market and its regulation by end of the year as required by the CFMA. Going into the meeting we knew that the CFTC and the Fed were more likely to support the retail swap industry expansion, with the SEC and Treasury more interested in a regulatory structure that allows their ""clients"" , the banks and broker/dealers to offer the swaps and protect against systemic risk. The agency which extended lead the meeting - in our case the CFTC. The other firms interviewed are Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Lehman, JP Morgan-Chase, Bank of America, ISDA, and Blackbird. First, we noted that our targeted customers are the small to medium size business, not the residential consumer. We argued that we can offer bundled retail swaps to those not meeting the eligible contract participant (ECP) requirements in deregulated markets where physically deliver is legal and possible, but unbundling the swap from the physical prohibits retail swaps to non-ECP customers. This is a large markets (8.1 million potential mass market and small mass market customers) and the benefits of swaps to manage the volatility of deregulating markets should not be reserved",chris.long@enron.com,"richard.shapiro@enron.com, d..steffes@enron.com, linda.robertson@enron.com,

"Tori: We have contacted Senator Gramm and Majority Leader Armey about the calls from Ken on Monday.

On legal certainty, nearly all interested parties agree. However, Senator Gramm continues to raise objections unrelated to legal certainty for our business. There are two issues (which we understand have primarily been advanced by Senator Gramm, one on bank products and one on SEC jurisdiction). Majority Leader Dick Armey is trying to gain consensus with the interested parties which include Senator Gramm, the Chairmen of the House Agriculture, Commerce, and Banking Committees, as well as the Department of Treasury, CFTC, and SEC. Meetings are occurring on a daily basis, but little concrete progress has been made since draft legislation was released on October 9. Talking Points: We need your help to resolve outstanding differences so that the Commodities Futures Modernization Act of 2000 can pass this year.

"NDN Senator Bingaman (D-NM) chaired the New Democratic Network (NDN) energy breakfast this morning. He told me he was looking forward to meet with Ken later in the day. He talked about how his Committee plans to proceed, beginning with the release today to Senators of a document that identifies issues that were included in both the Murkowski and Bingaman drafts of energy legislation. He hopes to make this the starting point for bipartisan comprehensive legislation. Bob Simon, Committee Staff Director, told me he was interested in working with Enron. After Sen. Bingaman departed, Reps. Cal Dooley (D-CA), Ron Kind (D-WI), Adam Smith (D-WA), and Rick Larsen (D-WA) talked about the New Dems energy plan. They restated their intent to focus on policy and not the rhetoric being spread by the Democratic Leadership. They also say they want a ""goal"" to reach, for instance, energy independence by 2020. I mentioned open access on the electricity grid as a mid-term energy policy goal. Follow up: I spoke to Rep. John Larson's staff about our investment in fuel cell technology in Connecticut. They called and want to meet with us next Wednesday. DLC The DLC is currently considering energy policy and Peter Fox Penner is leading the drafting.

"Steve - here is a brief update. The answer to the question on why exchanges should remain regulated, while we stay unregulated. The answer is: ""Enron provides a variety of risk manangement services to our customers, but these are not futures contracts which the CFTC has primary jurisdiction to regulate. We offer swaps, hubrids, etc., but no futures"". The CFTC does maintain anitfraud and manipulation authority if market abuses are discovered.

"This morning Enron was interviewed by the Federal Reserve, CFTC, SEC, and the Department of Treasury (also attending were the OCC and the FDIC). Scott Gahn from the commercial group lead the discussion and Vicki Sharp (legal), Mark Taylor (legal) and I supported Scott on the legal and regulatory issues. The goal in the meeting was to provide the agencies information so they can draft an interagency document on the retail swap market and its regulation by end of the year as required by the CFMA. Going into the meeting we knew that the CFTC and the Fed were more likely to support the retail swap industry expansion, with the SEC and Treasury more interested in a regulatory structure that allows their ""clients"" , the banks and broker/dealers to offer the swaps and protect against systemic risk. The agency which extended lead the meeting - in our case the CFTC. The other firms interviewed are Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Lehman, JP Morgan-Chase, Bank of America, ISDA, and Blackbird. First, we noted that our targeted customers are the small to medium size business, not the residential consumer. We argued that we can offer bundled retail swaps to those not meeting the eligible contract participant (ECP) requirements in deregulated markets where physically deliver is legal and possible, but unbundling the swap from the physical prohibits retail swaps to non-ECP customers. This is a large markets (8.1 million potential mass market and small mass market customers) and the benefits of swaps to manage the volatility of deregulating markets should not be reserved",chris.long@enron.com,"richard.shapiro@enron.com, d..steffes@enron.com, linda.robertson@enron.com,

The Senate will likely act next week. Senate Finance Chair Baucus floated a plan yesterday which included a one-year extension. The bill will go to conference committee and will undergo significant changes. Both Chairman Thomas and Finance Ranking Member Grassley are strong supporters of a longer extension, so two years is very possible.

"Mark - I do think we can get this done this year to our satisfaction. It won't be the energy provisions that bring it down...it will be the single stock future issue. I think we should hold off on the Ken Lay call until we have a better sense of the movement of the bill in the House and the politics in the Senate. We need to have a very clear and well-timed message delivered to Gramm from Ken. As to you coming to Washington, it would be most beneficial. But, as I have said above, let's decide after Congress returns when it would be most valuable (and you are available). In the next few weeks, I will spend time with the Rules Committee and the House leadership to more clearly know how the House plans to proceed. This will be crucial to our Senate strategy.

"I continued meeting with USG officials on 201. Today I met with Faryar Shirzad, Dept. of Commerce Assistant Secretary for Import Administration. Faryar is a friend from his days in the Senate. Faryar again said that the interagency working group is philosophically opposed to a 201 as a simple political solution and they are looking for alternative approaches. However, he noted that the industry is in crisis (not from imports alone) and they want to seek long-term solution. It was my sense that, unlike Competitive Analysis memo, the Administration is no longer relying on a 201 to secure support for Trade Promotion Authority (TPA). Faryar reported that a 201 decision is several weeks away, but will made by early summer. The steel industry continues to push the Administration, because they believe an Administration initiation carries more weight and will more likely result in quotas. The Senate Finance Committee Chair has said that July is ""trade"" month for his committee, so the Administration may want to announce their intentions before then. The Senate Finance Committee Chairman Grassley (R-IA)said that he was ""reluctant"" to vote on 201 in his Committee and said the steel industry should work with the Administration or file its own private action. This has not stopped Sen. John Rockefeller (D-WV) from encouraging Finance Committee action. The Administration could potentially initiate a 201 investigation and if harm is found they can seek quotas or other alternative. As noted above the Administration is looking to the alternative, one is that the industry would be forced to restructure (this is the gamble",chris.long@enron.com,"richard.shapiro@enron.com, linda.robertson@enron.com, lisa.yoho@enron.com","'Faryar Shirzad' : 'person', 'Sen.

I just spoke to the House Agriculture Committee Senior Staff who told me that the House will accept the Commerce Committee language. The Energy Group has been very active in support of the Commerce language because it includes both bilateral and multilateral exemptions for all non-agriculture commodities (including metals). This is a siginificant development because the CFTC and NYMEX have been opposed to the Commerce language especially as it applies to metals and electronic trading. The House leadership hopes to have the CEA Reauthorization bill on the floor later this week or early next under the suspension calendar (which means that the bill could be voice voted without amendment). Next to the Senate... where the CFTC and NYMEX will be equally vigilant and have good relations with Banking Committee Ranking member Harkin. We plan to meet with the interested parties sometime this week at which time we hope to debunk the myth that an unregulated OTC energy market could lead (or has led) to high oil prices.

The purpose of the Act is to eliminate unnecessary regulation of commodity futures exchanges and other entities falling within the coverage of the Commodities Exchange Act (""CEA"") and the provide legal certainty with regard to certain futures and derivatives transactions. By enacting such changes, Congress intends to promote product innovation and to enhance the competitive position of US financial markets. Certain provisions of the Act open the door for Enron's further product innovation and growth. Specifically, the Act provides important legal certainty for energy and other transactions occuring both on an over-the-counter (OTC) bilateral basis and on multilateral electronic trading platforms. Enron was a leading advocate of passage of this legislation. Bilateral Transactions Under the Act, bilateral transactions in all commodities (other than agriculture commodities) that do not occur on trading facility (i.e. not on a multi-party exchange) are exempt from most provisions of the CEA as long as the transactions are entered solely between ""eligible contract participants""(i.e. persons and certain legal entities satisfying capital thresholds and other requirements under the Act). This provision essentially codifies and expands existing CFTC exemptions for swaps and forward contracts, thereby eliminating a degree of legal ambiguity that has frustrated product innovation and growth. Multilateral Transactions In addition, the Act creates a broad",chris.long@enron.com,"jeff.skilling@enron.com, kenneth.lay@enron.com, steven.kean@enron.com,

Today we were successful in killing an amendment that was offered by Rep. Carolyn Maloney (D-NY) in the House Banking Committee during its markup of the Commodities Future Modernization Act of 2000. This amendment would have stricken language that provided an exclusion from CFTC jurisdiction for all non-agriculture transactions (energy, metals, broadband). The amendment failed, largely due to pressure from Enron, by a vote of 20-12. Rep. Ken Bensten (D-TX) joined Chairman Leach in speaking against the amendment. In more positive movement, yesterday the House Commerce Committee passed its version on the bill including a provision that exempts metal trading multilateral trading facilities from CFTC jurisdiction.

"Hello Chris -- Some initial thoughts: The American Banking Association just sent a letter on the issue. (see attached) Their definition of financial electronic trading networks are entities that facilitate the trading, settling, or clearing of financial instruments, ATSs, and any other system the SEC or Congress may designate as well as other similar entities that may develop in the banking or insurance areas. Because the new jurisdiction of the Financial Services Committee is general in this area, our discussion on Friday speculated that jurisdiction for ECN's would be determined by product. For example, financial products would fall under the Financial Services Committee but that ECN's on other products such as agriculture or energy and metals may fall under separate committees such as Agriculture or Commerce and Energy. ISDA will be sending its own letter on the issue. We must decide if our recommendation should also include comments on the treatment of energy, metals and agricultural ECN's. If so, we must decide if we will recommend that all jurisdiction for ECN's (including energy, metals and ags) should reside in the Financial Services Committee or if this jurisdiction should reside in multiple committees. Hope this is helpful. RUTH and DON -- please add any additional thoughts. Thanks!

Today we were successful in killing an amendment that was offered by Rep. Carolyn Maloney (D-NY) in the House Banking Committee during its markup of the Commodities Future Modernization Act of 2000. This amendment would have stricken language that provided an exclusion from CFTC jurisdiction for all non-agriculture transactions (energy, metals, broadband). The amendment failed, largely due to pressure from Enron, by a vote of 20-12. Rep. Ken Bensten (D-TX) joined Chairman Leach in speaking against the amendment. In more positive movement, yesterday the House Commerce Committee passed its version on the bill including a provision that exempts metal trading multilateral trading facilities from CFTC jurisdiction. Congress goes into recess tomorrow and we will have a better sense on how the Rules Committee plans to reconcile differences between the versions of the bill later this week.
