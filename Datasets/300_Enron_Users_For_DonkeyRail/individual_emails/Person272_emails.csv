This Nat Gas spread trade's price was set at better than 9 dollars, which is clearly a bad price, but PG&E is the seller and they could potentially try to hold us to the trade.

I'm sure that Commercial will also be trying to contact Legal regarding this situation and I will forward this email to them as well.

Currently we do it one of two ways: 1) Straight revision to original EOL Deal number, or 2) Input reversal trade, also input new trade with correct deal terms (confirms on all three). Obviously the 1st option above is the easier way to go for us. However for EOL auditing, option 2 is cleaner. Also, if you think we should always go with the 2nd option above, should we be linking the deals together with some sort of verbage?

This Nat Gas spread trade's price was set at better than 9 dollars, which is clearly a bad price, but PG&E is the seller and they could potentially try to hold us to the trade. Since this sort of situation could easily lead to problems (both legal and relationship-wise) with the counterparty in question, I would strongly reccomend getting guidance from the Legal Department on how best to handle the deal. I'm sure that Commercial will also be trying to contact Legal regarding this situation and I will forward this email to them as well. Just let me know if you have any trouble contacting them from your end and be sure to keep me informed of any decisions they make. I will do likewise if I hear back from them first.

"Just as I suspected. I showed the attached email to Mark Taylor, and he says he still wants to send out confirms, so if Dynegy wants to just throw them out, that's their business, but keep sending them as you would in the normal course of business. Larry Joe Hunter 01/08/2001 04:22 PM To: Stephanie Panus/NA/Enron@Enron cc: Samantha Boyd/NA/Enron@Enron, Susan Bailey/HOU/ECT@ECT, Jean Bell/HOU/ECT@ECT, Tana Jones/HOU/ECT@ECT Subject: DYNEGY DIRECT Stephanie, We currently do a couple of deals per day through an Online trading system called DynegyDirect. This is basically Dynegy's version of EOL. We are sending Confirmations on these deals just as we do with all other deals done with Dynegy. However, the CP is requesting that we not send these Confirms at all. Our Traders click on the deal which is then legally binding. Our back office personnel double-check our Trade Entry by going to DynegyDirect's web-site and checking the trade details. Dynegy simply throws out our Confirmations once they determine it relates to a DynegyDirect deal. I have told the CP that I would check with our legal dept about the status of sending Confirmations traded on DynegyDirect. Let me know if you can get someone to comment on this. thanks, Joe ---------------------- Forwarded by Larry Joe Hunter/HOU/ECT on 01/08/2001 04:06 PM --------------------------- Jean Bell",tana.jones@enron.com,larry.hunter@enron.com,"'Mark Taylor' : 'person', 'Larry Joe Hunter' : 'person', 'Stephanie Panus' : 'person', 'Samantha Boyd' : 'person', 'Susan Bailey' : 'person', 'Jean Bell' : 'person', 'Tana Jones' : 'person', 'Larry Joe Hunter' : 'person', 'Jean Bell' : 'person'",9,Re: DYNEGY DIRECT,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,received,larry.hunter@enron.com

With the governmental, the proposed form of legal opinion attached to the ISDA Schedule would have to be modified depending on your particular situtation (see footnotes in opinion). As I also mentioned, we are making some revisions to the guaranty we are getting from Hydro-Quebec in response to comments from counsel, and we may want to make some of the same changes to guarantees we receive from any governmental guarantor. If you end up having a governmental guarantor, let me know and I'll send you down the revisions.
