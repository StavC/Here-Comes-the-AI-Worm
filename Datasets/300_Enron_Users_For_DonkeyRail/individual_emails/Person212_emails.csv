"Anne, In order to manage our workload effectively and alleviate the stress on several members of our group, we would like to add an Analyst to our team. As we discussed in a previous meeting, rather than hiring another administrative assistant due to a quota which has been reached for the Research Group, we would prefer to bring on another Analyst, as they are not permanent and have a lower impact on the department's budget. Vince agreed in this meeting to let us hire an additional Analyst. In terms of responsibilities, we envision that the new Analyst would assume many of the analyst-related duties Leann takes care of today. For example, Leann's workday is concentrated on gathering research material for our weekly publication (Global Markets Monitor), preparing powerpoint presentations and completing the weekly economic calendar. This list of responsibilities does not give Leann sufficient time to devote to administrative work due to the group's workload and has been a source of stress for her. There are also some additional medical situations in our group that I am trying to effectively manage, which have been recently brought to your attention. In addition, Leann will be taking maternity leave soon. For specific details of the types of research, our group gave a presentation in one of our Thursday research meetings on the responsibilities and types of projects that each one of us works on. For your convenience, I have attached the portion of the presentation which contains the types of research that the Analyst would be responsible for.

Yesterday, I got a call from Terry Thorn, he needed economic information and a presentation to give to EGM management. I gave him a copy of the conforming assets presentation, he was very pleased. This week, I'm working on a urgent request from RAC. The board has decided to resurrect Dragon 2, so we are preparing all the curves for the APACHI region.

"Please find attached the Global Markets Monitor for the week ending 22 June 2001. Executive Summary US: The Fed is going to act again on Thursday June 27 to lower borrowing costs, but the question is by how much. We outline the convincing arguments for both a 25 and 50 bp cut at this week's FOMC meeting. The decision on the direction of interest rates must be viewed in the context of the Fed's concern about Japan. How does the U.S. strong dollar policy fit into this picture? Although we find the arguments for a 50 bp cut compelling, we expect the Fed to trim short-term rates by 25 bp on Thursday. Europe: Industrial production across the euro-zone falls again, pointing to a looming industrial recession in Europe. German authorities have lowered their GDP forecasts, not ruling out recession. Japan: The Japanese government released details of its restructuring plans, but few new tricks are revealed, and opposition to sorely needed spending cuts could be fierce. Lindsay's comments lead the yen lower. The global slowdown deteriorates Japan's trade outlook. Japan's crippled banking system makes its economy especially vulnerable to the global slowdown. Country Update - Argentina: In order to revive economic growth in the export sector, a new exchange rate system for the traded sector only was announced this week that gives advance benefit of a basket of dollars and euros to exporters. The Senate votes to make an official change to the Convertibility Plan (under parity conditions).

Due to the critical nature of Argentina we are monitoring it on a weekly basis in the GMM. Do you think it would be useful to provide regional updates on some regular basis, eg.on a quarterly basis or more frequently for Argentina.

Normally I would want to split this into two parts, but the way it's structured (several references to the charts at the end), this does not look immediately practical. We would certainly need Maureen's input on this. Without any further changes, I would want to publish the whole thing together. 2. I assume that Maureen will send the changes back to you, and that you will send me the final version for publication. Am I correct? I'll do everything else and hold release until Technical Corner is ready.
