"The differences we had on Friday were mainly volume related. Correcting the deal in SITARA and UNIFY relates to volume actualizations. It is not pricing related. As we talked about there are still some issues on the redwood gas. Redwood gas is the gas relating to the underdelivereis. In otherwords, when Palo Alto ""Burns"" less than we actualy schedule on the transport. Presumably we sell this gas to other 3rd parties, and Palo Alto will be reimbursed for the variable transportation.

I have attached a spreadsheet that contains the existing procedures used by Risk to check our new deal entry every night. I agree that the process must be enhanced because it leaves some room for errors because each Risk person is responsible for checking his or her own inputs. The existing procedures do not have a backstop in place for catching volumetric errors. We will have an additional ""check"" in place if the traders and the Risk group arrive at the same net new deals positions from independent sources. The following spreadsheet describes our existing process. The only addition to the procedures is the last section on Deal Entry. That section describes the new standardized Notebook and the deals to be entered by Risk. << File: NewDeal Procudures.xls >> The new procedures that are being put into place include the following: 1.
