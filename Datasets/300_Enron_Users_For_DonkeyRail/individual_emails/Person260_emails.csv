With SAP now here there are going to be a few minor changes that we will all have to make immediately. First: Everyone will have to make Internet Explorer their Default Browser. If you're not sure how to do this give me a call and I will help. The reason for this is that our new TimeSheet Program will only run through Internet Explorer. Second: Sometime next week we will have a brown bag lunch where I will walk you through entering your time in this New System. It's not time consuming just different. Third: Next Thursday you will be e-mailed an SAP log-on ID and Password. Please don't delete or disregard the importance of this e-mail. You will need it to key your time. Fourth: All company and RC #'s are changing. The company part is easy. It will be 4 digits so if your company number is currently 413 it will now be 0413 or if it is 012 it will now be 0012. Easy. RC #'s are now called Cost Centers and they are changing completely. Please write these down somewhere you will need them just like you need to know your RC. RC 1497 = CC 105633 RC 1638 = CC 105634 RC 2664 = CC 105630 RC 2933 = CC 106292 RC 0688 = CC 105631 RC 1160 = CC 105632 RC 2675 = CC 105638 RC 2939 = CC 106269 RC 2940 = CC 106290 RC 2663 = CC 105629 The transition shouldn't be too painful for you but it promises to be a little stressful for your assistants so please bear with us and,yvette.connevey@enron.com,"ami.chokshi@enron.com, julie.meyers@enron.com, michael.walters@enron.com,

No, BUT you will be gravely missed if you are not there, you will be left out of all the inside jokes that are sure to come as a result of this event, and you run the risk of being ridiculed by your co-workers for not attending.
