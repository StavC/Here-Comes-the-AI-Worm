Would you mind asking your team to email or phone me when they make a location change on a deal in sitara. We had a case yesterday where a deal was originally entered at one location for the deal and for the hedge. The point was incorrect and a person in logistics corrected it. The problem occurs in that sitara looks to verify the locations are the same on the deal and the hedge and if they are, it will then value the deal in the trader's book at mid. If the locations are different, it will value the deal at the customer price. This could potentially have a large impact on the trader's P&L. It does not seem pertinent to have your guys changing swap locations in addition to changing deal locations due to time constraints. We will be more than happy to make the changes, and we should also be able to catch these problems in the first place when we calc our books. I would greatly appreciate your groups help in cutting some of these issues off at the pass. If you have any questions or concerns, please feel free to give me a shout. Thanks.

The problem is - there's an exchange fee on both deals of $0.0725. But it's a negative fee on the sales side and a positive fee on the purchase side. That means I would owe them a netted amount of $145,000. Is that right?? Should the sale side maybe be positive so the two sides net to 0 - or do we owe them this money??

Would you mind asking your team to email or phone me when they make a location change on a deal in sitara. We had a case yesterday where a deal was originally entered at one location for the deal and for the hedge. The point was incorrect and a person in logistics corrected it. The problem occurs in that sitara looks to verify the locations are the same on the deal and the hedge and if they are, it will then value the deal in the trader's book at mid. If the locations are different, it will value the deal at the customer price. This could potentially have a large impact on the trader's P&L. It does not seem pertinent to have your guys changing swap locations in addition to changing deal locations due to time constraints. We will be more than happy to make the changes, and we should also be able to catch these problems in the first place when we calc our books. I would greatly appreciate your groups help in cutting some of these issues off at the pass. If you have any questions or concerns, please feel free to give me a shout. Thanks.

"Phillip, I spoke with someone in our technical team about the ability to provide the EnronOnline price reports in a downloadable format. What I think we can do is send a csv file (comma separated values) to the O:\ drive everyday containing all of the data that appears in the EnronOnline price reports. Then, you could just go in and open that it in Excel or copy and paste it from the csv file into Excel, which is easy. Let me know if I can explain this better. As far as saving it on the O:\ drive is concerned, I am currently thinking that we would just create a new folder that EOL can access and you can access. This way, if any other desk has a similar request to yours, they can just get permission to access that folder. We are going to finalize the details, and I will let you know how long it will take to get this done. The technical person who can do it is out of the office until Thursday, so I am assuming we won't have a good estimate until then. I will keep you posted. Thank you.
