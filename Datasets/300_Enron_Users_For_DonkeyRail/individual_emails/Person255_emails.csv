While trading on EOL or moving physical power you should not have a position larger than 100 MW. If you find yourself at these positions while trading EOL you should then widen your market so that you do not take on a larger position. If you have any questions please let me know. I would recommend that you put EOL product properties on manage stack... then you will be able to widen your market easily when your position reaches the 100 MW limit.

"17 August 2001 Brookhaven Energy Project Permit Application Ruled Complete by New York State Regulators (London - 17 August 2001) International Power plc, one of the world's leading independent power producers, today announces that the New York State Board on Electric Generation Siting and the Environment has accepted as complete its application to build the Brookhaven Energy Project on Long Island. The Siting Board's decision marks the beginning of the State's formal review process, and is a key regulatory milestone for the 580- megawatt natural gas fired electric generating facility. The ruling kicks- off a yearlong review process that will involve public hearings. International Power submitted the application for their proposed energy facility with the Siting Board, as required under Article X of the State of New York Public Service Law, on June 25, 2001. This application, which the State ruled as meeting the minimum requirements for compliance, addresses all of the pertinent environmental and siting issues of the project, including its design, location, fuel use, and air and water quality. ""The New York Siting Board's ruling puts us a step closer to providing Long Island with a clean and affordable new source of electric power,"" said Peter Giller, International Power's Chief Executive Officer. ""We are planning to begin construction of Brookhaven in the third quarter of next year and expect to have the plant in service by the end of 2004,"" he added.

"From time to time there have been discussions in the TIE list criticizing Con Edison for its involvement in out-of-merit actions, implying that it is inappropriate for Con Edison control room operators to make such requests. In its recent order on the Revised Local Mitigation Measures, FERC, in response to allegations made by Orion, ordered the NYISO to take responsibility for out-of-merit. The Con Edison system has the world's most concentrated use of energy for residential and commercial purposes. It is also a highly transmission-constrained area where transfer limitations under normal and second contingency conditions require certain minimum generation levels within specific load pockets to assure reliability under existing reliability rules. One of the main functions of the Con Edison control center is to be vigilant of system conditions at all times and prevent the system from reaching an unreliable operating state. When such conditions are imminent, the Con Edison operator so advises the NYISO. Some parties have said that Con Edison operators should never make out-of-merit requests. Con Edison operators would be acting irresponsibly if they were to detect an imminent unreliable operating condition and just sit back and not inform the NYISO of the potential danger. Con Edison operators have been trained to focus on operating the New York City system. The NYISO operators have a much wider state-wide focus. It is entirely appropriate for both a transmission owner (TO) and NYISO operators to work cooperatively in maintaining reliability with the clear understanding that under the FERC-approved tariff, it",sassonm@coned.com,d..thomas@enron.com,'Orion' : 'person',1,Out-of-Merit,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,received,d..thomas@enron.com
