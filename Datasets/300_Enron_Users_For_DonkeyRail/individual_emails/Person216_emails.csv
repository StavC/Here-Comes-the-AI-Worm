"1. Met with Ron Tapscott, Jim Studdert and Scott Laidlaw, primary subject insurance claim status. Scott Laidlaw gave Jim a letter from Siemens in which Siemens says the generator is a total loss (or cost to repair is greater than a new one). Jim will use this to give to the adjustor to get the survey and adjusting process going again. Jim needs a point of contact at Westinghouse to get access to the generator and get it unboxed for the adjustor to look at. The generator that is shown in the report is the 2nd generator in the hold and is not ours. Apparently our generator has not been unboxed and thus not directly observed. Rumor has it that the water line is not as high on the Enron box as it was on the box of the generator that is not Enron's. In my conversation with Mark T this morning I asked him for the name and telephone number of the Westinghouse point of contact for the adjustor so that the adjustor can arrange to see the generator. He stated he would have SW PM provide us that point of contact. I will sent Mark an Email reminding him of such. At the risk of making anyone or everyone nervous- but I think it is important for everyone to understand, I believe getting the pay-out value from the insurance adjustor is a vital element of the Calpine- SW deal. If the adjustor comes back with something less than the replacement value (other than the deductible) because he asserts that the generator was not (as a result of the water- but is now because it sat in a box unattended) ",john.rigby@enron.com,ben.jacoby@enron.com,"'Ron Tapscott' : 'person', 'Jim Studdert' : 'person', 'Scott Laidlaw' : 'person', 'Scott Laidlaw' : 'person', 'Mark T' : 'person', 'telephone number' : 'phone number', 'Email' : 'email'",7,Siemens - Westinghouse  31 Jan AM Update.,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,sent,john.rigby@enron.com

Steve: 1. Attached is a clean version of the May 31st draft of the exhibits (rev 5 ) and a comparison to Rev 3. The documents have been prepared by Peter. Soome of the exhibits have data unique to Longview in particular A A-1 B-3 B-5 the N series. 2. We need the following from GE a. Electronics of the fuel spec for A-2 b. The electronics of the Scope of Supply for Exhibit B-1- I think it is the SOW in the agreement in principle for Longview. 3. Exhibit B- Specification is being handled seperately and should be close to complete. 4. We will need to plug in the Guaranteed Delivery Dates for Exhibit B-2. 5. In Exhibit B-3 I based the output and heat specific performance guarantee values on the Longview AIP contract price. We need to bottom out the exhaust energy and temperature LD's in Exhibit B-5 so I can calculate the associated specific performance values. 6. Exhibit B-5 Liquidated Damages. I need to draft some proposed Delay LD language to deal with non- major components. Once done and agreed I can revise the example to fit. Also need to bottom out the exhaust related performance LD's. 7. Exhibit E- Need addresses. 8. Exhibit F- We are having Larry Lieb do quick review- 9. Exhibit F-1- Need to clarify who prepares the sound level test procedures. Need to understand the intent of the first sentence of the 3rd paragraph of the 1st page and the 1st sentence of the 6th from last bullet. 10. Exhibit F-2. See bolded questions. 10.

"1.0 John A and Armando. My question and John's response has led me down the following merry chase: The LM6000 contract has GE keeping risk of loss and damage until delivery to the Delivery Point. The Delivery Point is Jacinto Port. Without any other documents, GE has delivered the equipment and Risk of Loss and Damage is Brazilian Trust's. I understand that some deal was cut in a letter that Ben Jacoby sent to GE where GE keeps the ROL while in storage, but there are some storage costs. (Note:) We have a very painful experience on a turbine from another vendor where the point and time of transfer of risk of loss is a central issue to a dispute at hand.) I think we need clear documentation making it clear that GE has ROL for the equipment until we take it out of storage. As it relates to NEPCO if I understand it correctly the risk of loss chain is as follows: GE delivers to the Jacinto port where Risk of loss transfers to Brazilian Trust, Brazilian Trust delivers to the port and keeps risk of loss until Ex Terra, at which point risk of loss under the Turbine Purchase Agreement transfers to NEPCO, but under the EPC contract SFE assumes risk of loss at ExTerra. Thus NEPCO does not have a risk of loss exposure. I can see how NEPCO transports from Exterra to the Site under the EPC contract and is protected by clause 8.1 of the EPC Contract.

Attached is a redline against the present Take Over LD section of Rev 5 of GE world hunger. I made the changes based on what we have done in ARCOS. They are not the same because in ARCOS GE has the full testing program within their Commisssioning Period since they have the power island which is 1200 MW with the Purchaser having 24 MW for aux loads. I do not think that my new subparagraph (K) works. I have left it there to see if anyone else can tweak it and make it work. I am trying to get GE on the hook for acceleration costs that we incur and still beat the Time for Completion. We did not do that in Arcos since GE's time in theory is the same as the contractors.

Attached is a redline against the present Take Over LD section of Rev 5 of GE world hunger. I made the changes based on what we have done in ARCOS. They are not the same because in ARCOS GE has the full testing program within their Commisssioning Period since they have the power island which is 1200 MW with the Purchaser having 24 MW for aux loads. I do not think that my new subparagraph (K) works. I have left it there to see if anyone else can tweak it and make it work. I am trying to get GE on the hook for acceleration costs that we incur and still beat the Time for Completion. We did not do that in Arcos since GE's time in theory is the same as the contractors.

Attached is a redline against the present Take Over LD section of Rev 5 of GE world hunger. I made the changes based on what we have done in ARCOS. They are not the same because in ARCOS GE has the full testing program within their Commisssioning Period since they have the power island which is 1200 MW with the Purchaser having 24 MW for aux loads. I do not think that my new subparagraph (K) works. I have left it there to see if anyone else can tweak it and make it work. I am trying to get GE on the hook for acceleration costs that we incur and still beat the Time for Completion. We did not do that in Arcos since GE's time in theory is the same as the contractors.

"I took several assignments from the last World Hunger call. Status as follows: a. Tax language- I have sent a prior version of Rev 4 jr to Matt G asking him to call me to let me know when he can talk with GE tax rep. Steve Swifit and I are in London and would like to sit in on that call. b. Insurance Language review. I sent same version to David Marshall and Paul Parrish asking for their reviews and opinion as to whether 7FA's are new technology. c. I ""volunteered"" to look at the termination language in world hunger, GE had some problems, and I had the same problem with the ARCOs contract. I drafted a fix last Friday, sent to Kay M for comment. I have included my suggested changes in the attached redline. I have forwarded same fix to GE at end Friday for Arcos. I have asked Kay if she still has a concern with the Limit of Liability as it relates to termination. I think it works. d. I ""volunteered"" to work over Article 10, Exhibit B-3 and Exhibit B-6 in relation to Guarantees and liquidated damages. I have done that in the attached redline of the T&C and Exhibits. e. Some time ago I volunteered to resurrect the language associated with the reduction in the LD refund in Section 10.9.8. I had sent out a couple weeks ago but received no reaction.

The Delivery Point is Jacinto Port. Without any other documents, GE has delivered the equipment and Risk of Loss and Damage is Brazilian Trust's.

My question and John's response has led me down the following merry chase: The LM6000 contract has GE keeping risk of loss and damage until delivery to the Delivery Point. The Delivery Point is Jacinto Port. Without any other documents, GE has delivered the equipment and Risk of Loss and Damage is Brazilian Trust's. I understand that some deal was cut in a letter that Ben Jacoby sent to GE where GE keeps the ROL while in storage, but there are some storage costs. (Note:) We have a very painful experience on a turbine from another vendor where the point and time of transfer of risk of loss is a central issue to a dispute at hand.) I think we need clear documentation making it clear that GE has ROL for the equipment until we take it out of storage. As it relates to NEPCO if I understand it correctly the risk of loss chain is as follows: GE delivers to the Jacinto port where Risk of loss transfers to Brazilian Trust, Brazilian Trust delivers to the port and keeps risk of loss",kay.mann@enron.com,john.rigby@enron.com,"'John G Rigby' : 'person', 'John R Ayres' : 'person', 'Randy Pais' : 'person', 'dgohlke@skadden.com' : 'email', 'Kay Mann' : 'person', 'Armando Lucio' : 'person', 'Ben Jacoby' : 'person'",7,Re: Who delivers LM6000s from GE Facility to Site,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,received,john.rigby@enron.com
