"The following article appeared in today's Chronicle. Jan. 25, 2001, 10:59PM Enron rating setup irks many workers By L.M. SIXEL TONGUES ARE WAGGING at Enron Corp., and it's not because of the bonuses they're expecting next month. Employees are irate about a new performance-review ranking system that pits them against each other. Under the system, nicknamed ""rank and yank,"" employees will be put in one of five categories: 5 percent will be identified as ""superior,"" 30 percent will be labeled ""excellent,"" 30 percent will be called ""strong,"" 20 percent will be labeled ""satisfactory"" and 15 percent will be called ""needs improvement"" or ""issues."" An insider said ""needs improvement"" means ""you have one leg hanging out the window."" And ""issues"" is Enron lingo for ""you're gone."" The rankings, whose names reportedly took Enron officials hours to come up with, are not based just on performance. Instead, they compare employee against employee. ""It is possible, therefore, for someone to perform at the same or higher level compared to prior periods, yet receive a lower rating for the current period if other employees' performance raised the bar,"" according to a memo from Chief of Staff Steven Kean and Executive Vice President Cindy Olson that was distributed this month. While employees are competing against each other for ratings, they're also expected to be team players, according to the memo. `Horse-trading' of",kevin.ruscitti@enron.com,elisabeth_a_ruscitti@reliantenergy.com,"'L.M.

Kevin Ruscitti x3-6320 Parking & Transportation@ENRON 03/28/2001 04:07 PM Sent by: DeShonda Hamilton@ENRON To: cc: Louis Allen/EPSC/HOU/ECT@ECT, Raquel Lopez/Corp/Enron@ENRON Subject: Enron Center Garage The Enron Center garage will be opening very soon. Employees who work for business units that are scheduled to move to the new building and currently park in the Allen Center or Met garages are being offered a parking space in the new Enron Center garage. This is the only offer you will receive during the initial migration to the new garage. Spaces will be filled on a first come first served basis. The cost for the new garage will be the same as Allen Center garage which is currently $165.00 per month, less the company subsidy, leaving a monthly employee cost of $94.00. If you choose not to accept this offer at this time, you may add your name to the Enron Center garage waiting list at a later day and offers will be made as spaces become available. The Saturn Ring that connects the garage and both buildings will not be opened until summer 2001. All initial parkers will have to use the street level entrance to Enron Center North until Saturn Ring access is available. Garage stairways next to the elevator lobbies at each floor may be used as an exit in the event of elevator trouble. If you are interested in accepting this offer, please reply via email to Parking and Transportation as soon as you reach a decision. Following your email, arrangements will be made for you to turn in your old parking card and receive a parking",kevin.ruscitti@enron.com,parking.transportation@enron.com,"'Kevin Ruscitti' : 'person', 'DeShonda Hamilton' : 'person', 'Louis Allen' : 'person', 'Raquel Lopez' : 'person', 'email' : 'email', 'email' : 'email'",6,Re: Enron Center Garage,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,sent,kevin.ruscitti@enron.com

"Hey Kev, Good to hear from you. Hope all is well. Well we out here in the Golden State could certainly use some help from you and the boys at Enron................... Gray Davis is a little mouse! That about describes most peoples opininion of him. The power and natural gas situation out here is a mess! The gas situation is much worse for us at this point here in Long Beach. We haven't seen any power outages or any significant increase in our bill either. The gas front is an entirely different matter! I just paid a $300 bill for the month of Dec. I paid $100 for the same month in 1999. The usage (therms) was the same............ figure that one out?!?! At that level I might as well be paying for heating oil in Maine. Most people I talk to have scene their gas bill go up 2 or 3 fold. Anyway, things could be a whole lot worse I guess. Luke just had his 1st birthday party this past weekend. It was quite the scene.

Titan team officials explained that Titan fans intended for the final down field goal attempt to be good, and that replaying the down is therefore justified despite the ruling of officials that the ball did not pass thru the uprights. Titan team officials added that the width of the uprights confused kicker Al DelGreco (17yrs - Auburn) on the 19 yard attempt and that the uprights should be widened for a replay of the down. Cowboys team officials countered that DelGreco had seen the uprights before the game and had not complained to the officials. They added that Cowboy kicker Tim Seder (R - Arkansas) successfully kicked thru the same uprights during the game from distances of 47, 42 and 36 yards.",jjcardiff@duke-energy.com,kevin.ruscitti@enron.com,"'Jeff Cardiff' : 'person', 'Edling, Andy' : 'person', 'Andy_Edling@kindermorgan.com' : 'email', 'jjcardiff@duke-energy.com' : 'email', 'jjcardiff@duke-energy.com' : 'email', 'reason@duke-energy.com' : 'email', 'reason@duke-energy.com' : 'email', 'medling@msrn.com' : 'email', 'medling@msrn.com' : 'email', 'Al DelGreco' : 'person', 'Tim Seder' : 'person'",11,Sports News,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,received,kevin.ruscitti@enron.com

"Kevin, I received a statement from Wisconsin Gas that shows what we received at the different points from Wisc. Gas. My understanding on the deal that we have with EES is that we only buy from Wisconsin Gas what EES requests from us. On the statement, I can match up what is in our system for all of the points except for Willow Run (Michcon). The Wisc. Gas statement is showing that we purchased 13,291 dth on August 16. I did not see anything come through for EES at this location so I asked Julie Boehl in volume management to look into it. She did not see a brokered deal entered for EES at Willow Run. EES is showing purchasing 11,408 from us (they may be incorrect on their volumes) and we are not showing any sales that match to this volume.

"How did the move go? Everything inside the four walls? No, I haven't called Kampy yet. It's been a mess at work and we've been in Southern California seeing family the last two weekends. I just had 3 hours of training postponed, so maybe I'll get to it today. The job search is plodding along. I've sent out my resume to a lot of places, both for inv. mgmt. and for Treasury jobs, and I haven't gotten much response. The Treasury jobs all want 5 years or more of experience, which I think is a joke, but maybe they're getting applicants who qualify. It sounds like we might have two potential buyers for this company - a change of ownership/leadership might kill some of the uncertainty. I don't think I'd hang around here long-term, but anything that adds some stability is a good thing. I think the guy's name was Chris Sevrens. I knew him vaguely; nice guy, but one of the I-bankers who was in grad school because he had to be and never seemed to take it very seriously. Of course, I probably took it way too seriously, so what the heck. We've been out of town (first communion for our niece and a long-overdue trip to see my mom) the last two weekends so we'll be laying low.

Titan team officials explained that Titan fans intended for the final down field goal attempt to be good, and that replaying the down is therefore justified despite the ruling of officials that the ball did not pass thru the uprights. Titan team officials added that the width of the uprights confused kicker Al DelGreco (17yrs - Auburn) on the 19 yard attempt and that the uprights should be widened for a replay of the down. Cowboys team officials countered that DelGreco had seen the uprights before the game and had not complained to the officials.
