"Max - Hi there, sounded like (from Jaime) you guys have had a busy week with various government officials. I hope the result was good. We all had a really helpful meeting here in Houston with those guys, and I just wanted to let you know that we have found a person to focus time on Mexico and work with Jaime and Agustin. He is bi-lingual and very excited about the prospect. We expect him to be proactive and help out quite a bit with setting up the new Mexico trading legal entity. I have no doubt that this will fix most of the little issues that we discussed. We also assigned someone to come to Monterrey to set up Jaime and Agustin with system access where appropriate, and especially access to Livelink, our automated contract viewing system. This should facilitate access to all Mexico contracts online (originals kept in Houston), and there should be no need to keep hard copies in Mexico.

"Hi there - Hope you are well, and enjoyed the weekend. It was much too short for us!! I was wondering what the next steps are in terms of formalizing the role that you and I discussed in San Antonio. As Fernley gets closer and closer to nailing my replacement, I am feeling more and more exposed. As much as Rick and others have told me not to worry, it would be nice to nail it down. I really do think that I would benefit greatly from more of a middle office focus, and have the management skills to supervise a large team of people. I know I would bring a new perspective to the role, coming from more of a back office focus, and after my European experience know how to focus on key controls. Do I need to do anything? I have discussed February departure timing with Fernley and he is fine with it. Depending upon my replacement, it could be sooner. I would need a few weeks to get things wrapped up in London like moving and packing etc. and re-established in Houston -- need to buy cars etc. but otherwise there shouldn't be too much downtime between places.

Fred and Rahil are working on getting volumes for your group to estimate the marginal cost per transaction at different volume levels. We will use that information to estimate the cost side going forward. On the revenue side I believe that it can be misleading to use a cost plus approach and that we will be better off estimating the price counterparties are willing to pay for the service based on market comparables from the benchmarking studies Sally contracted a while ago. We will also take into account for pricing other variables as the contingent liability risks that they are avoiding by outsourcing their back office function and the issue of information confidentiality.

One of Jeff Sommers' people from Houston will accompany her in order to meet some of the people there and take a hand off from Heidi(since she has a day job in Australia)in terms of following up to see that these issues are resolved.

I have tentatively blocked out the week beginning Monday, Nov. 13th to come over to Houston, and would like to spend some of that time with you and your team, meeting people, and maybe just following you around for the day, as you suggested.

"RAC is responsible for updating the database, but they must get info communicated from the action item owners to know what to update. Shona and I oversee that process. The purpose of circulating to the reviewers is so that we have the most updated info, and we encourage more updates before the presentation to Causey and Buy next week. I am not sure I see what is wrong with pushing these guys to get more updates in. Certainly, we would communicate with any process owner BEFORE presenting to Sr management, if we feel that a major finding has been overlooked, in order to get a better understanding of the status, and why there has not been progress, as a final back stop to ensure that the wrong info is not communicated.

"Entelligence is being used in Houston, so they must have done training here. Patti is setting up my meeting with James for Friday. I just left her a message and asked her to let you know the time that is scheduled for - plus I will leave you a message after I have talked with him. I hope to have that meeting with James at 10:30. Interruptions have been rampant - and I am still not finished with reviews. Shona will actually be in Calgary at the same time that I will be, so we will do her review on the plane, in the airport or at the hotel - and I will tell her about the reorg. Again, I will leave you a message to let you know that we have had that conversation. That's great to have dinner with Lou. I think that it would be good to find out from him what sort of interaction he has with the London office, what's working, what's not working - in an informal way. Are they on an Enron network? Do they get Enron e:mails? How often does Lou go to London or someone from London mid office come to New York? I still suspect that New York is somewhat neglected just because of the distance between London and New York and the fact that there seems to be plenty for Mike and his team to chew on in London. Particularly now with a renewed focus on the scrap metal business. Enrjoy the OpRisk Conference.

I would like to visit with you to understand what you mean by ""operational issues"". My team has a meeting every other Monday focused on operational risk and we have various working groups that focus on key projects or initiatives that vary with need. A daily meeting on operational issues would need to have the appropriate team members there, and I hesitate to add an additional meeting to any key folks on my team if operational projects/initiatives are being covered either in our Monday operational risk meeting or in another forum. --Sally From: Rick Buy/ENRON@enronXgate on 04/23/2001 04:55 PM To: Sally Beck/HOU/ECT@ECT, Debbie R Brackett/HOU/ECT@ECT, David Port/ENRON@enronXgate, David Hardy/LON/ECT@ECT, Shona Wilson/NA/Enron@Enron, William S Bradford/ENRON@enronXgate cc: Ted Murphy/LON/ECT@ECT, Richard Causey/Corp/Enron@ENRON Subject: Operational Issues",sally.beck@enron.com,beth.apollo@enron.com,"'David Port' : 'person', 'Sally Beck' : 'person', 'Sally Beck' : 'person', 'Rick Buy' : 'person', 'Richard Causey' : 'person', 'Rick Buy' : 'person', 'Sally Beck' : 'person', 'Debbie R Brackett' : 'person', 'David Port' : 'person', 'David Hardy' : 'person', 'Shona Wilson' : 'person', 'William S Bradford' : 'person', 'Ted Murphy' : 'person', 'Richard Causey' : 'person'",14,Re: Operational Issues,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,received,beth.apollo@enron.com

"Great to hear from you. I was thinking about you today. I will look forward to your starting on the 29th. Certainly if anything comes up with the move or the family, feel free to shift that date as needed. I will be glad to have you as part of the team and think that we will have fun working together. I am on vacation next week (lots of shopping, wrapping, baking planned, plus Tyler's birthday party), and I am really looking forward to that. I do feel as if I have been the PRC queen recently.

I do need a break! I will be working the week after Christmas. Although we do have a holiday on December 26th, we will trading that day. Lots of my logistics and risk guys will be in, so I will probably make an appearance that day. I will be in for full days on the 27th -29th. Very few commitments on the calendar for those days, so just let me know when you would like to get together. Hope that you, Frank and Lauren have a wonderful Christmas holiday. --Sally Beth Apollo 12/15/2000 03:37 AM To: Sally Beck/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: Subject: Catch up Hi there -- As I recall you are off next week, so wanted to touch base.
