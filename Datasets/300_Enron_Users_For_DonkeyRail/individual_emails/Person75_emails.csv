"I think that the ""general policies"" route is the right (and only) one - particularly for the vast number of reference entities envisaged. From a legal sign off perspective, we should be able to give the immediate all clear, provided in the case of a ref entity, that it is not an existing customer/counterparty of Enron (if it is we'll need to check confidentiality agreements etc). We'll need to work out the quickest way of establishing this (but it is not per se a legal task) in the case of a ref entity, that we have carried out the necessary the legal due diligence in its country of establishment/location in the case of a counterparty, that we have carried out the necessary legal due diligence in its country of establishment/location Of course our legal due diligence may require us to take additional steps in the case of some countries/counterparties, but we will address these steps as generically as possible.

"David, Thank you for your comments on the US GTC. Taking each of your main points in turn: Section 2(e)(i)(1) - This Section does not preclude us from doing business with banks or other financial institutions. As you anticipate, breach of warranty constitutes an Event of Default entitling termination. Section 1 - Your main concern appears to focus on the issue of sleeving. As you will see, we have included in Section 1 of all GTCs a provision prohibiting transactions to be entered into by the reference entity itself or by any of its affiliates. Any purported transaction of that sort is automatically void. We considered carefully (both internally and with outside counsel) going further than this by including a provision stopping parties acting in concert with reference entity groups. We concluded that such a provision would be inappropriate for two main reasons. First, as a practical matter, it is almost impossible to police such a provision and detect cases of such collusion. Secondly, if we were to find out about such collusion, we would be entitled to withhold payment (regardless of any contractual provision) on the basis that such collusion constitutes fraud. It is also worth pointing out in this context that sleeving is not an issue germaine only to credit derivatives trading online. It is possible in the existing OTC credit derivatives markets for this kind of activity to be perpetrated. You will not find any provisions in existing market documentation addressing this point - indeed, the new 1999 ISDA Credit Derivatives Definitions are consistent with this.

"Employee Trading Having discussed this with Donna Lowry and Mark Taylor, there follows a very general clarification, highlighting the two main principles which apply to Enron employees' personal trading in securities and commodities. In general, provided an employee does not have non-public price sensitive information or confidential information obtained in the course of his employment in relation to the issuer of securities, then the employee is entitled to trade freely in the securities of that issuer. This is, of course, subject to compliance with the tems of the Restrictive Lists circulated periodically by Houston, to the SFA Personal Account Notice requirements (where relevant) and any other procedural requirements established by the Enron Business Unit in which the employee works. In general, it would be regarded as serious misconduct for an individual to trade for his or her own account in any commodity (eg. gas, power etc.) traded by any Enron Business Unit, whether or not the employee works in that unit. Questions regarding principle 1 above should generally be directed to Compliance (or you should seek your own private legal advice); questions regarding point 2 above should generally be directed to Ted Murphy. You should now sign up to the above Policy and comply with its terms, as expanded in this note. Thanks. Best regards.

"The exciting cocktail of credit derivatives and Enron Online raises significant novel legal risks for Enron. As most of you will by now know, probably the most significant risk would arise in a situation where Enron has confidential information about a reference entity and wrongfully uses that information in pricing the credit derivative on that entity. This could well result in legal proceeding against Enron. In practice, an allegation of misuse of confidential information can be very difficult indeed to defend without adequate procedures in place to safeguard that information. In fact, Enron's credit trading will, as you know, rely strictly on publicly available financial information and will not involve the use of confidential information, unless the reference entity has specifically consented. Nevertheless, to avoid the appearance of impropriety, we are taking additional steps to consider confidentiality agreements we have in place with potential reference entities before deciding whether or not we will quote prices on such entities. Against this background is the ever-present risk of ""insider dealing"". This crime - which in the UK carries a maximum prison sentence of 7 years and an unlimited fine - is committed where a person (or member of their family etc) deals in the securities (shares, bonds or derivatives on them) of a listed company on the basis of unpublished (confidential) price-sensitive information.

This is an issue in the case of credit derivatives which often have listed securities (normally bonds) as their reference asset. SFA require us to have in place an effective mechanism to ensure our staff do not commit this offence. We have concluded that operating a Restricted List procedure in London is the least onerous option - the most likely alternative would be to create a Chinese Wall involving the physical separation of traders from other staff. The Restricted List procedure is attached for your review and comment. As you will see, it is short, simple and self-explanatory. In essence, it establishes a channel through which price-sensitive information flows from the various business heads in to our SFA Compliance function who will maintain the Restriced List. Before deals involving listed securities can be executed, the trader will need to check whether the issuer of the subject securities is on the list. This process is manageable in the case of credit derivatives because the deal flow in such transactions is never enormous.

"FYI ---------------------- Forwarded by Paul Simons/LON/ECT on 11/09/99 01:26 PM --------------------------- Paul Simons 11/08/99 07:13 PM To: John Sherriff/LON/ECT@ECT, Mark Frevert/LON/ECT@ECT, Danny McCarty/LON/ECT@ECT cc: Michael R Brown/LON/ECT@ECT Subject: Restricted List As you know, insider dealing (dealing in listed securities when in possession of price-sensitive information concerning those securities or their issuer) is a criminal offence in the UK. This is an issue in the case of credit derivatives which often have listed securities (normally bonds) as their reference asset. SFA require us to have in place an effective mechanism to ensure our staff do not commit this offence. We have concluded that operating a Restricted List procedure in London is the least onerous option - the most likely alternative would be to create a Chinese Wall involving the physical separation of traders from other staff. The Restricted List procedure is attached for your review and comment. As you will see, it is short, simple and self-explanatory. In essence, it establishes a channel through which price-sensitive information flows from the various business heads in to our SFA Compliance function who will maintain the Restriced List. Before deals involving listed securities can be executed, the trader will need to check whether the issuer of the subject securities is on the list. This process is manageable in the case of credit derivatives because the deal flow in such transactions is never enormous.

I had a quick chat with Paul Wallace, as far as I can see this ""informal procedure"" has been put in place to achieve the effect of credit consolidation. I wonder whether in fact bona fide credit consoldiation could be put in place to deal with Sempra and Dapsa (an Argentinian counterparty where the same things happen). This would involve, ECTRI doing the deal with Sempra, the deal then being automatically novated to ECT Houston, with a back to back to ECTRI. ECT Houston would bear the credit risk (and be compensated at arm's length for this) and ECTRI would have the same economics as the original transaction with Sempra. With the informal procedure as it stands, there is the risk that ECT Houston could have a PE in the UK (UK tax presence), although providing that the swap back to ECTRI is respected the amount of the income subjected to UK tax ought to be just the compensation for the credit risk.

"I have one principal concern in respect of one of the three structures called the ""Commodity Transit Trade"" structure. The concern relates to the passing of title to the metal forming the subject-matter of the contract. Under this structure, MCC sells metal to the counterparty (""Counterparty"") on a spot basis with payment deferred (Contract 1). Counterparty simultaneously sells back the metal to MCC, also on a spot basis, but not on deferred payment terms (the spot payment received Counterparty therefore constitutes the finance) - Contract 2. The concern is that, as the transaction has been explained to us, there may be a delay of two or three days between (i) legal title to the metal passing to Counterparty under Contract 1 and (ii) legal title passing back again to MCC under Contact 2. There is therefore a risk that an event could occur in the interim which prevents title passing back to MCC. The most likely event would be the insolvency of the counterparty, but other events (eg supervening illegality due to the imposition of sanctions) are conceivable. More specifically, a liquidator of Counterparty could seek to disclaim (or set aside) Contract 2 if the market price of metal has increased during the interim. Consequences The consequences stem from the fact that the metal forming the subject matter of these financings will typically be on the high seas bound for a third party (ie not counterparty). MCC will have a contractual obligation to transfer good title to the metal to that third party.

"I think that the ""general policies"" route is the right (and only) one - particularly for the vast number of reference entities envisaged. From a legal sign off perspective, we should be able to give the immediate all clear, provided in the case of a ref entity, that it is not an existing customer/counterparty of Enron (if it is we'll need to check confidentiality agreements etc). We'll need to work out the quickest way of establishing this (but it is not per se a legal task) in the case of a ref entity, that we have carried out the necessary the legal due diligence in its country of establishment/location in the case of a counterparty, that we have carried out the necessary legal due diligence in its country of establishment/location Of course our legal due diligence may require us to take additional steps in the case of some countries/counterparties, but we will address these steps as generically as possible.

"Mark As mentioned at our trading meeting on Tuesday, we are putting together a tailored ISDA schedule for our banking counterparties with which we propose to trade credit transactions. One issue we have revisited is whether the definition of Specified Indebtedness (which ties into the cross default provisions) should be expanded to cover derivatives transactions as well as the more conventional bank borrowings. We think there are arguments both ways on this, but wonder whether we have a ""house view"". Since the definition is not expanded in our standard ISDA schedule, we assume that our preferred position is to exclude derivatives transactions from the cross default provisions of the ISDA.

"As you probably all know, we are on the verge of launching credit derivatives trading in Europe and North America, both on Enron Online and off-line. This will involve quoting prices for buying and selling bankruptcy protection in respect of reference entities, many of whom are our counterparties in a variety of different commercial and financial contexts. This exciting cocktail of credit derivatives and Enron Online raises significant novel legal risks for Enron. Probably the most significant risk arises where Enron has confidential information about a reference entity and wrongfully uses that information in pricing the credit derivative on that entity. This could well result in legal proceeding against Enron. In practice, an allegation of misuse of confidential information can be very difficult indeed to defend without adequate procedures in place to safeguard that information. Against this background is the ever-present risk of ""insider dealing"". This crime - which carries a maximum prison sentence of 7 years and an unlimited fine - is committed where a person (or member of their family etc) deals in the securities (shares or bonds) of a listed company on the basis of unpublished (confidential) price-sensitive information. In addition, SFA rules require the safeguarding of confidential information, the misuse of which is a serious disciplinary matter. In order to ensure the success of this new business, we are now introducing new policies and procedures (attached) which include a simple Restricted List procedure.

"David, Thank you for your comments on the US GTC. Taking each of your main points in turn: Section 2(e)(i)(1) - This Section does not preclude us from doing business with banks or other financial institutions. As you anticipate, breach of warranty constitutes an Event of Default entitling termination. Section 1 - Your main concern appears to focus on the issue of sleeving. As you will see, we have included in Section 1 of all GTCs a provision prohibiting transactions to be entered into by the reference entity itself or by any of its affiliates. Any purported transaction of that sort is automatically void. We considered carefully (both internally and with outside counsel) going further than this by including a provision stopping parties acting in concert with reference entity groups. We concluded that such a provision would be inappropriate for two main reasons. First, as a practical matter, it is almost impossible to police such a provision and detect cases of such collusion. Secondly, if we were to find out about such collusion, we would be entitled to withhold payment (regardless of any contractual provision) on the basis that such collusion constitutes fraud. It is also worth pointing out in this context that sleeving is not an issue germaine only to credit derivatives trading online. It is possible in the existing OTC credit derivatives markets for this kind of activity to be perpetrated. You will not find any provisions in existing market documentation addressing this point - indeed, the new 1999 ISDA Credit Derivatives Definitions are consistent with this.

This is an issue in the case of credit derivatives which often have listed securities (normally bonds) as their reference asset. SFA require us to have in place an effective mechanism to ensure our staff do not commit this offence. We have concluded that operating a Restricted List procedure in London is the least onerous option - the most likely alternative would be to create a Chinese Wall involving the physical separation of traders from other staff. The Restricted List procedure is attached for your review and comment. As you will see, it is short, simple and self-explanatory. In essence, it establishes a channel through which price-sensitive information flows from the various business heads in to our SFA Compliance function who will maintain the Restriced List. Before deals involving listed securities can be executed, the trader will need to check whether the issuer of the subject securities is on the list. This process is manageable in the case of credit derivatives because the deal flow in such transactions is never enormous.

I wonder whether in fact bona fide credit consoldiation could be put in place to deal with Sempra and Dapsa (an Argentinian counterparty where the same things happen). This would involve, ECTRI doing the deal with Sempra, the deal then being automatically novated to ECT Houston, with a back to back to ECTRI. ECT Houston would bear the credit risk (and be compensated at arm's length for this) and ECTRI would have the same economics as the original transaction with Sempra.

"Paul, Mark T. asked me to have a look at the GTC's you prepared for Credit Derivatives in the USA. I think you did a great job on the GTC's and have just a few suggestions/comments/questions: 1. Would it not be easier for the Counterparty to understand the document if the Definitions were in Section 1? Failing that, it would be helpful to indicate upfront that there is a glossary of Defined Terms at the end of the document. 2. I agree with Mark that we would expect for a signed Confirmation to control over the GTC's (and/or ETA). Section 1 is inconsistent with this idea. 3. Section 2(d)(iii): I wonder why we are making the Trade Option rep. here. I would not have thought that a Credit Option could be considered a ""commodity derivative"". Put another way - does Sullivan and Cromwell really think that the CFTC has jurisdiction over credit products? I would have thought credit products are more similar to an OTC equity derivative. I wonder if they have considered any potential SEC issues. 4. Section 2 - under the BOLDED WARNINGS, (C) regarding ""... Enron ceasing to provide quotations"". This seems inconsistent with the opening paragraph which says that this website should not be construed as an offer by Enron to buy or sell. If that is the case, why is Enron providing quotations? Seems to me that if one is offering a quotation, one is offering the price at which one will buy or sell.

"The scenario outlined by Denis is consistent with advice previously provided by the Tax group. London based traders should be executing deals in the name of Enron Credit.com Ltd (not ENA.) Houston based traders should be executing transactions in the name of ENA (not Enron Credit.com Ltd). Back to back transactions to transfer all positions to Enron Credit.com Ltd will simplify financial and tax reporting if ENA will on a regular basis be laying off positions acquired by Enron Credit.com Ltd. If ENA is simply laying off positions acquired by ENA then strictly there is no need for the back to back.
