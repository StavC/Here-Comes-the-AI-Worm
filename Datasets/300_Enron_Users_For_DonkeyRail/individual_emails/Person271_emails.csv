"FYI Here is the language I gave Jeff to propose for an amendment to the Sher Bond bill which will make sure Direct Access customers don't pay for DWR power costs through the bonds EXCEPT for power they actually used that was purchased by DWR. Houston has to ok this and then Jeff has to sell it. I also strongly recommend that the next to the last sentence of Water Code Section 80110 be repealed in the bill. That would leave direct access in place and force DWR to come to us to get a bill that would have reasonable exit fee provisions. Without a change like this, the bill would simply reaffirm the ban on direct access and that could cause us to lose at the Commission. There is nothing else in the bill which explicitly tells the PUC to not suspend direct access.

"Jess, there is little more than I indicated in my note. I received a phone call from Sarita Sarvate, an analyst at the Energy Division of the CPUC asking why we were returning gas customers to utility service, citing ""a number of customer complaints, including a school and a hospital"". It now turns out that the school and the hospital are from the same customer essentially. The CPUC staff recognizes that they have no direct jurisdiction over gas sales, but are concerned about the effect of turnbacks on their utility regulation, as they are in the process of eliminating the core subscription program which allows noncore customers to take core service. In fact there is now a resolution in place barring noncore customers from taking core subscrition service from SoCalGas or SDG&E. They want to know if this is part of a trend which they will have to adapt to or whether it is an isolated incident. In addition, they would like to be able to offer the customer some options for continuing gas service. Let me know if I can add any more or if you can assist us in responding to the CPUC.

"As I told Bob in an earlier email, I noticed this same provision. However, it could be implemented in one of two ways.

"We have confirmed that there is no current agenda item pending for the CPUC to act on banning direct access. Having said that, there are reports from highly placed staff that an item to implement the AB-1X ban is being held in Bilas' office, as he would like to see the legislative process run its course, but there is a possibility that Lynch will reassign the matter to another commissioner who opposes direct acess (Wood)in an effort to kill DA before any other legislation is passed. Please note: The foregoing is internal speculation/gossip from within the commission, and should not be considered as confirmed. Notwithstanding the controversy over implementing AB 1X, Commissioner Brown has written a letter to Bowen endorsing direct access and her bill, and publicly supported direct access in the Commission meeting today. That means 3 commissioners have voiced support for DA, and only 2 opposed. This again raises doubts over the accuracy of Bowen's statement--which may have been designed to scare opponents into supporting her bill. We are attempting to get a copy of the letter sent by Brown and will forward it to the lobbyists if we obtaining. Stay tuned.

"<<X16049.DOC>> Here are proposed amendments for the Ducheny siting bill, AB 970, which reflect the input of Sam When and Allan Thompson. In addition, I have reviewed the SCE/PG&E rate stabilization proposed legislation. This legislation extends a rate cap type rate stabilization plan until March 31, 2003. The language included a ""flexible"" rate cap so that the commission can increase rates to reflect variations in the cost of gas and electricity, etc. It has some language to ensure that the ""customers which benefit from stabilized rates do not avoid costs associated with providing the stabilized rates"". This would seemingly prevent cost shifting and retroactive ratemaking. The main thrust is to allow the utility to recover all non-CTC costs during this period. It specifically amends Section 368(a) to eliminate a provision which appears to require the utilities to absorb all costs (including CTC) not recovered by the end of the transition period. My main reaction is that this bill is not necessary. The SCE and PG&E caps are still in place and will be in place through most if not all of 2001. This bill is being offered now to increase its chances of passage in the ""crisis mode"" now prevalent. It should be deferred until the commission has proceeded farther with its investigation.

"Hello all. I am back from the CPUC and available to participate again. As for Sue's concern, I do not believe Edison will say that our payment of PX credit issue (the subject of the complaints) is directly in the ""free-for-all"" case, but they will assert that that case will resolve the issues related to how to calculate the credit in the post Jan 17 time frame and that once that is decided, Edison will have all the information it needs to pay all the ESPs correctly, as they still intend to pay us on the original methodology for the pre Jan 17 period. Therefore, they will say that once the Commission resolves the free for all issues it will resolve all the issues in the complaint. I should respond to SCE's attorney soon, so we can contact the judge and ask him to take the matter off calendar. Is everyone in accord?

"I think the letter is well organized to get our message across that a comprehensive solution is needed. The only concern I have is the reference at the end of the first paragraph to ""the crisis grows daily with no clear resolution offering long term relief in sight."" In fact we do no have several bills on demand side management, one by Wright on accelerating repowering of power plants and allowing incentives for voluntary conservation, at least a vehicle for utility cost recovery (AB-18X), and a Bown bill to restore direct access rights compromised by AB-1X. So I am concerned that the legislative leadership would take some umbrage at the notion that we dont see any of what they are doing as offering hope for a long term solution. Perhaps we could rephrase it to say that the piecemeal elements of positive solutions that have been discussed or offered need to be clarified and blended into a comprehensive proposal which has the following elements....and then lay out our case. Sandi, do you agree with my concerns? Otherwise the elements of the letter are fine, and track what we are trying to draft in terms of legislative language. I will break down the proposals into groups of issues for ease of review, even though we may later want to consoliate the entire package. Please call if you have any more questions.

"Brian, regarding the storage issue raised by Craig Chancellor in his note, this is an issue about which I do not wish there to be any uncertainty. With regard to a customer's use of on-system storage, whether the gas is delivered on system or off system upon withdrawal, there should be no additional ""storage charge"" as mentioned in Craig's note. What I understood was that any deliveries to on system delivery points of gas withdrawn from SoCalGas storage or any other on system storage provider (when there is one) would not involve a double transportation fee. In other words, as happens today, there would be a tranport charge on injection, and a regular full tranport fee paid by the customer on withdrawal and delivery to the on system burner tip, BUT WITH A FULL CREDIT FOR THE INJECTION TRANSPORTATION CHARGE, so that only one net transport charge is made. Please confirm that this is the result in such an example. With regard to the delivery of storage gas on withdrawal to an off system delivery point, I do not see any rationale for imposing a second transport fee, or failing to offer the same credit as it offered for on system delliveries from storage. This would seem to be particularly true as Lad indicated that such deliveries would be accomplished by displacement, and would be subject to operational restrictions so that they would only be accomodated when SoCalGas had sufficient flow through the interconnect to make the displacement work. Please explain the rationale, if any, for the imposition of an entirely separate transmission charge in this circumstance.

The first is a list of open matter numbers which either a) have been approved for some level of activity; or b) the attorneys assigned to the case believe there may be some additional level of activity expected or warranted in the future (in which case authorization will have to be sought at the appropriate time). The second list consists of matter numbers we believe should be closed as we expect no more costs or activity in any of these matters. Please comment on either at your convenience.

If the bond language is passed without altering that, the CPUC can argue that the Legislature has expressly endorsed the ABX -1 suspension of direct access again! What are our chances? Is the Burton/Hertzberg language you referece different than the Sher bill? If so, should I look at it?

"Will do. P.S. Mike Florio informs me that the order from the 9th Circuit requires TURN to file papers with the District Court judge justifying their request for a permanent stay within 5 days. Following a hearing at some unspecified time, the District Court judge will rule on that request. If, as expected, he denies the stay, TURN will get one more bit at the apple by appealing that order to the 9th Circuit.

"Jeff: At your request I am offering this memo to explain the status of the agenda items before the CPUC on the issue of suspension of the direct access program. There are two pending draft decisions at this time, the first is the proposed decision of ALJ Barnett (Item H-7 on the last agenda) which was modified by a changed version submitted by Pres. Lynch at 2:45 pm on 9-5-01, the day before the last meeting. This version indicated that direct access was suspended as of the date of the order (which would have been Sept. 6) and states in another ordering paragraph that the utilities are to advise their customers that the suspension is effective Sept. 6, 2001, specifically naming that date. This order would have been interpreted to suspend direct access as of Sept. 6 if it had been voted out that day. The other item, Agenda Item H-7A on the last agenda, is the Bilas alternate decision which calls for hearings to determine the impact of direct access on the issuance of bonds, and does not suspend direct access at this time. Please be advised that the suspension date contained in H-7 can and probably will be changed before the orders are considered at the CPUC meeting on Sept. 20. Either the Sept 6 date will be changed to the 20th of Sept., or some other specific date could be inserted at all the locations in the order dealing with the suspension date. All that is required to make this change is the distribution of a changed page on the Escutia table before the Commission meeting. Thus, it is important for all direct access supporters to continue to urge the",mday@gmssr.com,jdasovic@enron.com,"'Jeff' : 'person', 'ALJ Barnett' : 'person', 'Pres.

"The PUC has released the PD of ALJ Wong which proposes to alter the CPUC education program for electric restructuring. It proposes to take the budget for the education program and spend it all on conervation messages, and to drop the current program elements which advise consumers that direct access is available to them. This is a bit short sighted as direct access ca reduce state financial impacts of the high-priced market.

"Greetings Jess: I work in Government Affairs in San Francisco.

There's a very easy fix to the situation. The Commission can reverse the bad decision it made a month or so ago, and permit customers to return to utility service. I've forwarded all of the information to Catherine Woods and Roger Ponce.

"There is much that is valuable in this letter, and a number of things are brought to light. However, in light of our initial plan, to provide an easy to scan piece for ""any fourth grader"" and to produce something for release to the press, I am concerned that the approach taken in this letter is a little too legalistic for our target audience. I was thinking that something simpler and more designed for the common man might be appropriate.

"Greetings Jess: I work in Government Affairs in San Francisco. I would like to discuss internally and think hard about this before we give any response to the staffer at the CPUC---not because we have any reason not to respond, but because this a problem created almost exclusively by the PUC, and I don't want to give the PUC the opportunity to shift bad decision making and actions onto us. There's a very easy fix to the situation. The Commission can reverse the bad decision it made a month or so ago, and permit customers to return to utility service. I've forwarded all of the information to Catherine Woods and Roger Ponce. Let's discuss more internally when we've gathered up all the facts and then decide whether and how we choose to respond to the staffer at the PUC. My number's 415.782.7822. Feel free to give me a ring. Thanks very much Mike for helping to track down the info.

"Mike - Here is the situation. Between ENA and EES, we sell gas to core and non-core customers, and also have gas in storage as well as in the park and lend service. I think we can be sympathetic to the ORA argument that the diversion tariff penalties did not anticipate OFOs and EFOs in situations such as we face here (shortages due to credit problems rather than lack of supply). Assessing extreme penalties, as the OFO/EFOs would do, on users who are not perfectly imbalance under this situation certainly seems unfair. However, I think we should argue that limiting the payments to shippers/customers whose gas is diverted to serve core customers to a market index may not fully compensate for the diversion. The pay back specifically does not include interstate pipeline charges, and there may be other costs as well to the marketer/customer who had supplies taken away. I need an estimate of the cost to make this filing and follow it up for the RCR process, and I would also like any feedback anyone has on what our position should be in this matter.

There are two pending draft decisions at this time, the first is the proposed decision of ALJ Barnett (Item H-7 on the last agenda) which was modified by a changed version submitted by Pres. Lynch at 2:45 pm on 9-5-01, the day before the last meeting. This version indicated that direct access was suspended as of the date of the order (which would have been Sept. 6) and states in another ordering paragraph that the utilities are to advise their customers that the suspension is effective Sept. 6, 2001, specifically naming that date. This order would have been interpreted to suspend direct access as of Sept. 6 if it had been voted out that day. The other item, Agenda Item H-7A on the last agenda, is the Bilas alternate decision which calls for hearings to determine the impact of direct access on the issuance of bonds, and does not suspend direct access at this time. Please be advised that the suspension date contained in H-7 can and probably will be changed before the orders are considered at the CPUC meeting on Sept. 20.

"Mike: I regret that we had a difficult call yesterday. We greatly appreciate the good work that you do and the commitment you and your firm have to our company. Moreover, I recognize that the legislature is a difficult environment and that there is substantial pressure on you and Sandy. I also recognize that needs and demands can change quickly and, at times, our RCR process can be difficult! All that said, however, the Government Affairs group has an obligation to use our internal and external resources in the best and most cost-effective manner. The RCR process helps us satisfy that obligation.. From our conversation yesterday and a later call with Sandy, it appears that there is some confusion on how we will use the RCR process to contract for legal support for our legislative efforts. Hopefully this e-mail will clarify the process so there is no confusion in the future and so that you can feel comfortable you are undertaking work that is authorized and for which we have a budget. 1. To begin, it appears from your e-mail yesterday that Goodin, MacBride has billings as of May 11 for approximately $10,000 on direct access, windfall profits, the ""Global Settlement,"" and Power Plant Siting. With respect to this work, I recognize that there may have been confusion about our budgeting and RCR approval process. These billings will be included in the RCR-approval requests discussed below. 2As we discussed yesterday, the work associated with the billings in May was conducted without any RCR approval or any budget in place. As you know we terminated the two legislative",paul.kaufman@enron.com,mday@gmssr.com,"'Mike' : 'person', 'Sandy' : 'person', 'Sandy' : 'person', 'e-mail' : 'email', 'e-mail' : 'email', 'Goodin, MacBride' : 'person'",6,Legislative Support,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,received,mday@gmssr.com

That would leave direct access in place and force DWR to come to us to get a bill that would have reasonable exit fee provisions. Without a change like this, the bill would simply reaffirm the ban on direct access and that could cause us to lose at the Commission.

First, we are sending this via email at your suggestion, rather than traditional hard copy letter through the United States mail. We think this is a good suggestion and we understand that we will be able to reply upon an electronic response from you via email even though it will not be signed and we will not have a hard copy sent by you. If for some reason this is incorrect, please let us know immediately. The subpoenas, as issued, all call for a production of documents by Wednesday October 4, 2000 unless other arrangements are made. At our face to face meeting last Friday, September 29, 2000, Michael Day and I discussed with you the practical problems associated with the Enron Entities attempting to respond within that time frame. Our understanding after that meeting is as follows: (1) The Enron Entities will not be required by the Commission to produce documents or respond to the subpoenas in any way by October 4, 2000.
