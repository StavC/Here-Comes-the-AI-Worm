"June nomination into the pool should have been 500 Mcfd of production gas (from Phillips) and 7,500 Dth of pool gas from Power Gas Marketing. You should check with Heidi Boyd @ CES for the actual noms into the pool. She should have nominated these volumnes into CES's pool since ENA does not have a pool. As far as I know, the pool to pool transfer fee is $0.04/Dth or $100.00 which ever is LESS. Therefore, for volumes over 2,500 the transfer fee should be $100.00 no matter what the volume is. Phillips' contract for 500 MCFD metered production goes through NOVEMBER (this volume may be less because of high line pressures). Power Gas Marketing's contract for 7,500 Dth /Month pool to pool goes through OCTOBER. If Clinton is interested in the volumes through contract expiration, I can ask Phillips to grant us permission to move the meters into Clinton's pool.

What I have found about Enron, if you have a good idea... just go for it... if it makes sense. If your group does decide to consolidate these tickets... then please have the person responsible for inputting your deal tickets to do this consolidation.

"I have not discussed August forward with anyone yet. I would like to discuss our options on handling the pool with Heidi, hopefully after the July 4th holiday. I hope you guys have a happy 4th if I don't talk to you before. From: John M Singer @ ENRON 06/30/2000 06:45 AM To: Chris Germany/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: hboyd@columbiaenergygroup.com@ECT Subject: Re: EOG for July, Peoples Since we have meters (Phillips Production meters) in the pool, if PNG will allow, it may be best to transfer the pool to ENA's name. If the CES pool has to be closed, Phillips Production will have to sign documents to move meters from pool to pool. I'm not sure what the lead time is to move meters. If you are going to nom 430 Dth/Day, Heidi needs to nom Phillips Production @ 9,058 Mcf/Month (9,058 * 1.03 = 9,330 dth) plus Power Gas 4,000 Dth/month. Is Clinton going to take the PNG throug the end of the contracts? Power Gas expires 10/31, Phillips expires 11/30.

"Just got word from EES, they can take the EOG gas. Marde will show me a number after I find out if CES wants this or not. Marde also said the seller pays a flat $100.00 to transfer gas out of their pool to EES's pool. Marde said the nom for June would be done as an imbalance transfer and she paid IF +$.09 for gas this month. EES cannot take any Peoples gas. Should I have Scott Hendrickson try to sell it to Peoples? I'm also going to leave a message for Paul at Clinton. Marde is going to check around.
