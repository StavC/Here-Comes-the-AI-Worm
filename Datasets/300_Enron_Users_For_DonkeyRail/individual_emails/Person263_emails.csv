Sara's extension is x35620. As for your matter concerning a contract employee -- I concur with you and do not believe you are being overly cautious. I have worked with Howard during my tenure with EOG, and will therefore revise page 2 of the Schedule to Master Agreement to reflect Howard Selzer's name and title.

"Susan: I'm not sure that what I told you to do in the CSA Annex with respect to Custodians and their qualifications work so for now let's keep it out and go back to our old language. Sara and Mark: Shari had a counterparty point out to her that in our CSA Annex language where we talk about the circumstances under which a party can ""hold"" collateral, all of our triggers are based on something happening to our counterparty and nothing is said about what would happen if a Custodian holds the colateral and fails to be creditworthy. Do you have any thoughts on this? At first I thought that we should require the Custodian to be a Qualified institution but I'm not sure that that is the right approach. Let me know what you think.
