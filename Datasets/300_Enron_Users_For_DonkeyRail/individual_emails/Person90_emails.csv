"Provided below are timelines representing the time between Shipper request for transportation and contract tendering by Transwestern for two of the more recent non-standard contracts which were provided by Transwestern to Southwest Gas Corporation and Sempra. The provided timelines provide an example of the various factors which impact the turn-around time of a Shipper's request for service and the actual activation of a new or amended transportation service. Kevin Hyatt has received a flow chart of all the processes of acquiring an executed contract from the point of contract negotiation to actual executing by shipper - a 10 step process. Our group can certainly discuss options to expedite this process. Sempra 6/9 Sempra negotiates right to call upon TW Permian to Needles capacity. Sempra understands they need to submit formal request for transportation for new service. 6/12 Stephanie Katz indicates she want the remaining 1,500 Dth/d of Needles capacity. Has not yet provided TW request for the ""call"" capacity. 6/20 Stephanie and TK negotiate rate for the 1,500. Does not provide TW request for Transportation. 6/21 Sempra provides request for transportation for the 23,000 Dth/d of capacity, but specifically asks TW to WAIT to process untill they determine their supply side receipt point allocation. CS attempts to relay to Sempra the ""alternate rights"" which the discount letter will contain as a heads-up.

"Guys - Weather permitting in the Texas Panhandle area, I expect to be in Friona, TX on Monday, November 20th, on business. Provided below are some items I would have mentioned in the Monday staff meeting: Plains Farmer's Coop - To date, I have been able to collect approximately half of the $500,000 imbalance which Plains Coop owes TW. I will be meeting Charles Hough in Friona (Friona is located 100 miles west of Amarillo) on Monday to discuss the payment plan for the remaining imbalance amount in additionaI to other general business matters. I discussed my action plan with legal and credit and will request full payment by January 31, 2000, latest date. Effective Febrary 1st, TW will also include penalty payments with any future imbalance outside the +/- 10% tolerance level. Pogo Producing - I met recently with John Havard with Pogo. Pogo plans to spud a well in Eddy county which is an offset to the EOG operated well recently completed and in the process of being attached to TW. Pogo's well will be spud in December with an expected 60 day drill & completion time. They have an optimistic expectation of the production being close to the EOG well - current initial production of 14 MMcf/d, and have plans for additional drilling in the field area.

"Summary of COGA conference follows. FYI - at the time of the conference, the conference organizers indicated that all speakers presentations would be made available at the COGA.org websit after the conference. However, COGA is currently experiencing difficulties in actually getting each speaker to provide this information. I have requested a copy of the Interstate Pipeline (CIG/Questar/El Paso/Transcolorado/Western/NWPL) presentations to be mailed to me and will circulate them when I receive them. They provide interesting summaries of pipeline expansion programs. Main conference themes which seem to be repeated among various speackers include the following points: - Annual U.S. domestic requirements are headed towards the 30 TCF point sooner than expected. One attributable reason for the higher than expected growth rate was the impact of growing internet & cellular activity of the nation. It was estimated that these combined markets have grown from representing 2% of total electrical requirements of the nation to approximately an 8-10% range which will be sustainable from this point forward. In addition, overall healthy economic growth of the nation also contributes to the increase in domestic gas demand. - Power River Basin coalbed methane production has the highest potential growth opportunity for Rocky production. - Currently the companies most active in Rocky Mountain exploration & production are experiencing a shortage of geologists, engineers, and field personnel which they fear may impact the desired rate of field developement - Rig counts in the Rockies are on the rise, but additional rig",christine.stokes@enron.com,kevin.hyatt@enron.com,'I' : 'person',1,Trip Report,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,sent,christine.stokes@enron.com

"Lindy - We receive a report from IGS which does track the California deliveries of Kern River. The remaining volumes, and we do assume that Kern River is 100% full, does get dropped off to the Nevada market. Sometimes, the California deliveries are as low as 325 MMcf/d, which does indicate a strong Las Vegas/Nevada market demand.

"I have had a casual chat with some of my accounts regarding their opinion of the market dynamics affecting the Needles to Topock price differentials. Each customer focused more on the supply side dynamics of Topock gas supplies, rather than the incremental intra-state transport costs required to transport to the PG&E citygate, as the primary driving force for the Needles to Topock price differential. Here is a recurring theme I heard from my customers: The El Paso Merchant Service (EPMS) 1.2 BCF contract's Block II capacity (500 MMcf/d of Permian to PG&E/Topock capacity, $.065 transport rate) has a re-callable aspect. If EPMS schedules gas under the transport of Block II capacity to any other California delivery point other than PG&E/Topock, then other parties may recall the capacity for their own use to PG&E/Topock. Currently Duke has recalled 100 MMcf/d and PG&E Energy Trading has also recalled 100 MMcf/d for their use to transport Permian gas to PG&E/Topock. (FYI - EPMC may re-recall this capacity, but they have elected not to). These additional Topock supplies coming from Duke and PG&E Energy Trading under Block II capacity may be viewed as providing an oversupply of gas to PG&E at Topock. This gas competes head to head with Malin gas prices. For example, today's Malin price is $4.62 while PG&E/Topock price is $4.69.

"Christine, the ""actual fuel usage"" provision is probably a material deviation from the tariff, unless we cap the fuel rate at the maximum percentage stated in our tariff. I have added language to this effect. If we're using the ""actual fuel"" language because we anticipate that the fuel usage will exceed the maximum, and therefore we do not wish to cap the percentage at the maximum, we can certainly leave my additional language out and file a summary of the contract.

"Christine, see the attached. I've changed paragraph 8 to be like our last posting, and added in a sentence saying ties will be decided by lottery (but omitted reference to the lottery provisions of our tariff this time). My only other comment is that I think the group needs to discuss beforehand how a shipper's request for alternate points is going to be treated. As currently drafted, this notice prohibits shippers from conditioning bids on use of alternate points at the bid rate, which calls into question our granting the winning bidder use of alternate points at a discount. If we do intend to let the winning bidder shippers use alt. points at a discounted rate, we should take this statement out (end of paragraph 5). If we're still living in a max. rate world, though, this really is not much of a concern since use of the alternate points would also be at max. rate. Any questions -- give me a call. S.
