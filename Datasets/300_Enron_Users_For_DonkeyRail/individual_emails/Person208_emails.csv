Review the dates on your products. We are in the process of converting ""regular"" products to ""Tokenized Reference Period"" Products. A Tokenized Reference period product is one which the system sees as ""Day Ahead"", ""Month Ahead"", ""Month Ahead +1"", etc - but this is not what you or your customers see. At midnight every night, the system checks the current date and then CHANGES the dates shown on the Product Description. For example, if Product #20451 is ""Month+1"", then on Feb. 28, the Short Description on the Website and in Stack Manager would show ""April1-30"". However, on March 1, the system will automatically change the date of Product #20451 to show ""May1-31"". Note that the Product number stays the same, but the date has automatically updated.
