The WSCC data, which is dicey and we don't have until July 1999, and the CEMMS, which comes on a delay, are ultimately our best sources. For your purposes the CAISO may suffice. I think that you probably know this already, but there can be a siginificant difference between ""scheduled"" and ""actual"" generation. You are pulling ""scheduled."" If someone doesn't schedule their generation and then generates, either instructed or uninstructed, then you will miss that. You may also miss generation of the northern california munis such as smud who only schedule their net load to the caiso. That is, if they have 1500 MW of load and 1200 MW of generation, they may simply schedule 300 MW of load and sc transfers or imports of 300 MW. Having said all of that, it is probably close enough and better than your alternatives on the generation side. On the load side I think that I would simply use CAISO actual load. While they don't split out NP15 from SP15, I think that using the actual number is better than the ""scheduled"" number. The utilities play lots of game on the load side, usually under-scheduling depending on price.

I think Thursday afternoon is when you will all go to the Tux place in North Miami to try on your tuxes & make sure that the measurments are right when they still have enough time to make any adjustments. Friday, during the day, Max will have something planned for you guys... Please start getting your measurements now & we will send you another email when we find the place for you to call in your measurements in Miami.
