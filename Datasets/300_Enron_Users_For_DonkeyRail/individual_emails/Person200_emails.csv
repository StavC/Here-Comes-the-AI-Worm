"Vince- I have a simplified version of Brad's model in mind. The ""no arbitrage"" condition equates trading margins across the country. Costs of transmission rise with congestion on the network. Wellhead supply is almost completely price- elastic, while burner-tip demand is almost completely price inelastic. Storage is rationalized as a perpetual call option. The least time-variant parameters are the costs of injecting and withdrawing gas from storage to the pipeline, followed by the costs of delivering gas from the wellhead to the pipeline. The intermediate-variant parameters are the capacity-dependent costs paid to the pipeline (above shrinkage) for transmission. The most time-variant parameters are the trading margins and the valuations of the storage option. There are 8 parameters to be estimated at each major node of the betwork. They are identifiable in either of two straightforward ways: using a short time series of the last 3 days prices based on the assumed variability mentioned above, or point-estimates (""calibrations"") using only today's data based on a node-based model of competition between pipelines where pipes with the same region of origination, albeit markedly different terminus, price versus capacity similarly, ""competing"" for outflows.

"Vince- 1. We can detect ""hoarding"" of pipeline capacity as an elevated basis against the actual inflow. 2. We can detect ""market power"" by dissociating the seller from the buyer, distinguishing between the physical ""cost"" in gas to run the generators and the transmission cost in dollars, i.e. the basis. 3. (As you noted) We can detect ""storage"" as the difference between inflow and consumption. It appears to me there are two time series needed for a straightforward model of gas prices: flow rates at interconnects (from telemetry) and spot-market prices. There is an elevated basis reflecting pipeline companies monopolizing capacity, as well as hoarding of capacity by contracts. The dynamics of gas prices reflect consumption demand changes due to changes in expectations for the weather, as well as their impact on two highly strategic behaviors: hoarding of pipeline capacity and storage of gas. We can ""calibrate"" the price elasticity of demands for consumption and storage, and the price elasticities of demand for transmission, as well as the extent of hoarding, from the two sets of numbers mentioned: flows and prices. What the basis trader needs to understand are the incentives, and disincentives, for storage and capacity-hoarding, in terms of the calibrated price-elasticities, and each of these are as-if exotic call options at the consumption hub. Finally, flows are ""explained"" by the model, and can be imputed from prices if necessary, resulting in a purely stochastic model of the basis in",clayton.vernon@enron.com,vince.kaminski@enron.com,"'Vince' : 'person', 'seller' : 'person'",2,gas prices,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,sent,clayton.vernon@enron.com

"Vince- Here is the basic idea I was alluding to: Suppose a car dealer promised to ""match any advertised price."" Then his competitor would feel the need to respond in kind. And so on, until all dealers advertised they would ""match any advertised price."" Now, consider one of these dealer's decision to perhaps lower his prices. If he does so, everyone will immediately match his price, so his market share will remain unchanged, at whatever it was before, but his revenues (and all other dealers as well) would be lowered by the amount of his price reduction. So, the dealer rationally decides not to lower his prices to try to sell more cars.

"Vince- I have a simplified version of Brad's model in mind. The ""no arbitrage"" condition equates trading margins across the country. Costs of transmission rise with congestion on the network. Wellhead supply is almost completely price- elastic, while burner-tip demand is almost completely price inelastic. Storage is rationalized as a perpetual call option. The least time-variant parameters are the costs of injecting and withdrawing gas from storage to the pipeline, followed by the costs of delivering gas from the wellhead to the pipeline. The intermediate-variant parameters are the capacity-dependent costs paid to the pipeline (above shrinkage) for transmission. The most time-variant parameters are the trading margins and the valuations of the storage option. There are 8 parameters to be estimated at each major node of the betwork. They are identifiable in either of two straightforward ways: using a short time series of the last 3 days prices based on the assumed variability mentioned above, or point-estimates (""calibrations"") using only today's data based on a node-based model of competition between pipelines where pipes with the same region of origination, albeit markedly different terminus, price versus capacity similarly, ""competing"" for outflows.
