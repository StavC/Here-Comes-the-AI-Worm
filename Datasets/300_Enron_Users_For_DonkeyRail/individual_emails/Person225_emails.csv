One of the programs we sponsor is a first-year law student internship program. This committee meets with the students at all of the law schools in Houston and asks them to submit their resumes. We then provide copies of the resumes to prospective employers for review. The employer then selects the students they would like to interview. Some employers have the students participate in their permanent hiring programs. Others provide this simply as a learning experience for the students. The employer determines the length of the internship and the compensation. Six weeks is a common period. This is a great program which has provided valuable experience to a large number of students for many years. If your organization would be interested in participating in this program, or if you would like more information, please e-mail me or call me. I appreciate your consideration of this matter.

The consent allows us to serve PTNs for basically every bad act committed by our Indian counterparts to date. We will need further lender approval to serve PTNs for future bad acts. On Saturday, we served PTNs on MSEB for (a) failure to pay certain amounts under the PPA and (b) repudiation by MSEB of the PPA. There are a few more PTNs that will be served on MSEB in early June -- the underlying defaults for these PTNs required a 60 day notice period before service of a PTN and these notices were served in early April. Paul Kraske, General Counsel of Dabhol Power Company, told me that he receives 4 Indian newspapers (including national newspapers) at his apartment.

As reported in the press, DPC did receive a two-page letter from MSEB purporting to rescind the PPA with immediate effect because DPC materially misrepresented the capabilities of the power plant (i.e., 6 hour actual ramp-up time vs. 3 hour ramp-up schedule in the PPA). However, the letter goes on to state that MSEB is ""agreeable to continue the present arrangement of power and payment until disputes are resolved by the appropriate forum."" We are not entirely sure what this last part means and are asking MSEB for clarification. Obviously, this letter is quite a buttress to our already-delivered PTN contending that MSEB has evidenced an intention not to be bound by the PPA. While MSEB's letter seems to state that they will still honor some aspects of the PPA, the letter adds that ""payments would be subject to adjustments on the basis of determination of reasonable compensation and quantum meruit by a competent authority."" We hear rumors that MSEB will approach the Maharasthra Energy Regulatory Commission (MERC) for a ""how much should we pay DPC"" determination.

The Indian banks are trying to induce the foreign banks to fund into a project with a repudiated PPA. It is becoming more apparent to us that the Indian banks are being heavily influenced by the Government of India and not acting as commercial institutions. Our business people do not believe that all or most foreign banks will continue funding at this point. It is likely that the Indian banks could act on their own to cure the construction contract payments which give rise to termination this month (about $34 million). Within a few months, however, the Indian bank facility would be fully funded. Today, we filed our writ petition in the Bombay High Court challenging MERC's jurisdiction.

Wade Cline@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT 11/22/2000 12:32 PM To: Rob Walls/NA/Enron@Enron, Mark E Haedicke@ECT, Bruce Lundstrom/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT cc: Subject: Rob/Mark/Bruce: DPC issues Rob/Mark/Bruce -- I'm not copying you directly on these messages below as I don't want others to think they have not been doing their job and I am calling them on the carpet. I think the legal team has been doing exactly what has been expected from them, but maybe some of our newer business people haven't understood the need for India legal to communicate freely and often directly to Houston legal. I'll take care of that. But after my recent visit to Houston, and discussions there with you and others, I just want information to flow freely and often between India and Houston. So I'm trying to make sure that happens by encouraging info flow below. If you ever feel you need more, please let me know. I'll also let you 3 decide how you want info to flow from the India legal team up to Houston. You may wish to have them deal directly with just one of you or all 3. Your call, and you can communicate this to the India legal team as to how you want communication to occur.

The overall policy which seems to be now agreed to for European emails appears below. INBOX- Deletion after 30 days SENT deleted after 30 days- ( now confirmed that once in folder, it will not be deleted s.t comments below) TRASH- 15 days( same as policy ) FOLDERS- moved to archives/ livelink via OUTLOOK after 365 days after being in folder ARCHIVES 6 years (livelink or Ivault) However while the above time limits have been 'agreed', IT have also been developing project OMNI which as I understand it will replace Lotus Notes with Outlook.

"Gentlemen - Dabhol events over the last week to 10 days have not been encouraging: We made claim against the GOI Guarantee for the December invoice. Under the terms of the GOI Guarantee, the GOI has 30 days (of which about 23 are left) to make payment. The December invoice is now about 50 days overdue.

Subject: Hello from Tulsa CONFIDENTIAL Good morning, gentlemen. Mutual colleagues in the energy industry have suggested that I contact you directly about joining the Enron organization in a senior legal or business capacity. I relocated from San Francisco to Tulsa in 1996 when I was recruited to join MAPCO in a General Counsel's position. A year later, MAPCO was acquired by Williams, where I have served as one of four Associate General Counsel. I have now learned that in a merger (even one billed as a merger of equals), it is preferable to be on the buyer's side rather than to be included among those who have been acquired!!! Thus, I am seeking new opportunities at the Deputy/Associate General Counsel level. Williams and Enron share many of the same businesses, operations and values. The experience gained at MAPCO/Williams, coupled with general leadership and management skills, is easily portable to another energy company. Moreover, the Company's current difficulties may create the need for a senior lawyer with substantial litigation, government investigation and policy advocacy experience. I get to Houston often and would very much like to meet with you even if only for an exploratory discussion.

"In light of the impending arbitration proceedings between DPC and MSEB should we file a third party beneficiary claim against MSEB regarding the Fuel Management Agreement? The FMA is not part of Enron's equity in the plant, but is directly related to MSEB's performance under the PPA. EFI is due $2.5 million per year in monthly installments, fluctuating with the plant's availibility and based on DPC being paid by MSEB. Currently $13.8 million of MTM value and approximately $21 million of acurral (non PV dollars) is at risk on Enron's books. The DPC plant went commercial in May, 1998 so there are seventeen (17) years left on the FMA.

"Gentlemen - The MSEB letter below is an unfortunate event. MSEB is positioning itself to claim that it owes no money to DPC for approx. 3 months of billings because it has a mis-declaration claim against DPC. In our initial review, our lawyers, both in-house and outside counsel, believe that DPC will prevail on this issue. We are currently preparing a more detailed legal analysis. But it will likely affect DPC's cash flow and may affect DPC's ability to complete Phase II. It is also disappointing that MSEB has chosen to start a brawl before the results of the Review Committee are announced and the parties have the opportunity to meet to discuss the results.
