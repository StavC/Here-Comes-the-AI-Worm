In our previous communication, we indicated that we would provide you with more detailed information as it became available. Beginning Friday, October 26, 2001 at 9 a.m. C.S.T, the procedure for calling Enron's Houston offices from international locations, excluding Canada, using the 800-97-Enron phone number will change. The new procedure is as follows: 1. Please dial the WorldPhone International Access number for the country where you are located (country access code), which is available on the attached wallet card, accessible through the following link: http://home.enron.com:84/messaging/mciannouncement.doc. 2. You will then be prompted for your PIN number. Since calling cards and pin numbers are not required to use this service, all users should respond by dialing 1-800-97-ENRON or 1-800-973-6766. 3. You will then be asked to enter your destination. Please dial 0-800-97-Enron (800-973-6766) to reach Enron's corporate offices in Houston.

"Sorry, I did not realize you were awaiting a response from me on this. Our deal is with the subsidiary, not the parent. So the name of the counterparty should be Catalytica Combustion Systems, Inc., (CCSI) not Catalytica. Regarding the credit issue (Annex B; Credit and other special provisions), I can't see how we are exposed to credit risk; we will not sign the XONON Implementation Agreement with GE until we have received the $9.9 million payment from CCSI. If CCSI does not agree to return the spark spread confirmation upon our request, as defined per the agreement, then CCSI is in default of the agreement and the spark spread confirmation becomes worthless. My main concern is with the general terms and conditions of the spark spread confirmation because I know there are some errors in there that need to be corrected: There are three prices for the Gas Daily index referenced - low, high and mid. We need to define which curve we want to reference. We need to change the name from Catalytica to Catalytica Combustion Systems, Inc.

"Sara, Attached is the last draft in our directory; believe this is the most recent copy Regarding the OMNIBUS agreement, I found a copy from Brad and I believe it is a standard document. However, it appears as if we were originally planning to add some language to cover credit issues. As the deal is now structured, CCSI pays us the entire amount of 9.9 MMUSD up front, instead of in tranches. If the spark spread swaption were to somehow become effective, CCSI would never have to pay Enron additional funds under any scenario, we only can pay out to them if they elect to exercise at the end of any given month during the 2003-2013 period in which the swaption could become effective. If the swaption is out of the money, CCSI will never exercise for that month. Therefore, the only possible exposure on the credit side that I can now think of is the initial period between the actual signing of the deal and the actual transfer of the funds. I don't have an electronic copy of the OMNIBUS documentation, we only ever had a hard copy.

You should take special note of the credit that Paul is insisting upon (seems to be similar to AIG). This is all credit - but note his Additional Termination Event if the ISDA is not executed within 60 days. You must discuss all of the items with your counterparty. Also, if you do the deal(s), give me the name, phone/fax numbers, email addresses of all commercial and legal for your counterparties.

"Sara: Just a few additional thoughts on this list as possible topics: 1. credit event upon merger - seems like more counterparties want to define the ""materially weaker"" standard. Alos, I'm wondering how credit monitors mergers in general. 2. additional termination events - when does credit consider additional events like change of control, MAC, chnages to partnership agreement or structure etc. 3. minimum transfer amount - how it works and how it is different from the threshold 4. threshold amount - what triggers makes it reduce to zero 5. enforcement of collateral remedies - going over the timetable for enforcing our remedies when a counterparty fails to post and the different cure periods. 6. letter of credit bank qualifications - confirming with credit that these are still current 7. cash collateral in Canada Carol St. Clair EB 3889 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax) carol.st.clair@enron.com Sara Shackleton 02/20/2001 09:47 AM To: Carol St Clair/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: Subject: updated credit luncheon discussion list Sara Shackleton Enron North America Corp. 1400 Smith Street, EB 3801a Houston, Texas 77002 713-853-5620 (phone) 713-646-3490 (fax) sara.shackleton@enron.com",carol.clair@enron.com,sara.shackleton@enron.com,"'Alos' : 'person', 'Carol St. Clair' : 'person', '713-853-3989' : 'phone number', '713-646-3393' : 'phone number', 'carol.st.clair@enron.com' : 'email', 'Sara Shackleton' : 'person', 'Carol St Clair' : 'person', 'Sara Shackleton' : 'person', 'Houston, Texas 77002' : 'postal code', '713-853-5620' : 'phone number', '713-646-3490' : 'phone number', 'sara.shackleton@enron.com' : 'email'",12,Re: updated credit luncheon discussion list,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,received,sara.shackleton@enron.com
