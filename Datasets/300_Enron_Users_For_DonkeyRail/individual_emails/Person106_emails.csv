"Kay: The enclosed ENA Consent looks fine to me, but you may wish to run this by Sheila Tweed, as she had a specific request on the NY court jurisdiction language. We initially advised Isabel Parker that Enron would accept NY federal court jurisdiction but not jurisdiction of NY state courts. She did not take our comment, and Enron subsequently said it would accept jurisdiction of commercial courts in Manhattan, but not state courts generally (language suggested by Sheila Tweed through Carlos Sole). Isabel has drafted the revised version to delete reference to NY state courts altogether and to limit the federal courts reference to those located in the borough of Manhattan.

"Kay and Carlos: Greg Lang advises that they are targeting a financial closing with their lenders on Thursday, April 19. If this bears out, the escrow would be funded three business days later, on Tuesday, April 24. However, ENA can terminate the letter agreement if the escrow is not funded on or before Friday, April 20. Therefore, PPL may (although I have not confirmed their intent in this regard) fund the escrow immediately following their financial closing, rather than waiting the three business days. They are proceeding under the assumption that an acceleration of payments to GE will be negotiated. If not, Plan B (the ""non-disturbance"" lien) requires additional documentation with their lenders and with ENA that may result in some delay. Resolution of this issue is obviously critical to the timetable. Let me know if you have any questions or comments. Thanks. Carolyn M.

At the closing, the signed Facility Agreement will not be ""delivered"" unless the loan is funded by Tejas. With respect to your concern about confidentiality, we have reviewed the confidentiality provisions of the master contract. One might conclude that the master contract does not expressly permit the disclosure of confidential information by Enron to prospective assignees, as a ""Permitted Assignee"" seems to include only an assignee who has received an assignment. On the other hand, it is arguable that there would never be any assignee without some disclosure, so that disclosure to prospective assignees must have been intended by the parties.

"Kay: I spoke with Isabel Parker on the following issues: 1. I requested copies of the note, security agreement and the non-disturbance lien document. She said they will be using a securities account with a securities intermediary structure (UCC Article 8 concept) rather than a non-disturbance lien. She said they are working on these documents and will furnish as soon as possible. 2. I advised that the ENA consent is satisfactory. 3. I advised of the timing issue on the GE consent, such that the GE acknowledgement of payment needed to be prospective due to logistical issues. She is considering this. 4. She requested a quick response on whether the GE letter agreement is consistent with Enron's discussions with GE, as she needs to get this to GE as soon as possible in order that they will be ready to sign it on Friday 4/20. The GE letter agreement (agreeing to the form of all of the documents) must be signed this Friday 4/20 before the lenders will advance funds, as this letter agreement is a condition precedent to funding. Please advise on this issue. I also spoke with Greg Lang and expect comments on the Escrow Agreement within a half hour or so.

I have a recollection that ENA actually needed the 7 business days and no less (thus the requirement of ON the 7th business day) in order to prepare for closing, and was trying to avoid the possibility of the counterparty wanting to close before ENA could complete the matters required of it to properly effect a transfer.

"Hi Carolyn, In addition to my comments regarding the definitions, here are some other thoughts: Letter agreement: I would bracket [Spawn], since we don't have it formed yet and we probably haven't checked on availability. 2. Closing date should be at least five but no more than 10 business days. 2 (a) Facility Agreement is probably the more appropriate concept than Turbine Contract. Not a big issue if anyone disagrees with this terminology. 3. Make the guaranty for this agreement and the LLC agreement. 5 (d) change 1st ""shall"" to ""'may"". 7 (b) does this make sense? Should we also have the right to specific performance? 9. (iii) consents won't necessarily be obtained at the time of the signing of the letter agreement. Should say by closing such will have been obtained. I haven't done a reg evaluation, so I would delete the reg rep unless you are comfortable.

"#2 sounds like the CA Development structure to me. ""Campbell, Carolyn"" <CCampbell@KSLAW.com> on 04/04/2001 05:58:50 PM To: ""'kay.mann@enron.com'"" <kay.mann@enron.com> cc: ""Keffer, John"" <JKeffer@KSLAW.com> Subject: New Proposal by Delta on HSR Fee Split Kay: I advised Greg Lang that Enron had approved our tentative proposal on splitting the HSR fee, with Enron bearing a maximum of $25k. Bill Blumenthal (our HSR expert) has now spoken with Dave Burns (Paul Hastings' HSR expert), and Bill reports back that Mr. Burns now agrees that there is exposure to an HSR filing requirement upon exercise of the put/call. Apparently, Mr. Burns had not previously focused on the transfer of the remaining 20% interest in the LLC pursuant to the put/call in his analysis. They also agree that the filing fee will be determined by the fair market value of the assets in the LLC at that time. Greg Lang called after his report from his HSR expert and now proposes the following alternatives: 1. Straight-up 50/50 split of fees (with no $25k maximum on Enron's contribution), so that the parties are equally incentivized to minimize the fee; or 2. Draft additional provisions whereby Enron consents in advance to some structure such that upon exercise of the put/call, the value of the assets owned by the LLC are as low as possible. This may involve transferring one or more of the turbines to",kay.mann@enron.com,ccampbell@kslaw.com,"'Campbell, Carolyn' : 'person', 'CCampbell@KSLAW.com' : 'email', 'kay.mann@enron.com' : 'email', 'kay.mann@enron.com' : 'email', 'Keffer, John' : 'person', 'JKeffer@KSLAW.com' : 'email', 'Greg Lang' : 'person', 'Bill Blumenthal' : 'person', 'Dave Burns' : 'person', 'Paul Hastings' : 'person', 'Greg Lang' : 'person'",11,Re: New Proposal by Delta on HSR Fee Split,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,received,ccampbell@kslaw.com

"Hi Carolyn, In addition to my comments regarding the definitions, here are some other thoughts: Letter agreement: I would bracket [Spawn], since we don't have it formed yet and we probably haven't checked on availability. 2. Closing date should be at least five but no more than 10 business days. 2 (a) Facility Agreement is probably the more appropriate concept than Turbine Contract. Not a big issue if anyone disagrees with this terminology. 3. Make the guaranty for this agreement and the LLC agreement. 5 (d) change 1st ""shall"" to ""'may"". 7 (b) does this make sense? Should we also have the right to specific performance? 9. (iii) consents won't necessarily be obtained at the time of the signing of the letter agreement. Should say by closing such will have been obtained. I haven't done a reg evaluation, so I would delete the reg rep unless you are comfortable. I want the HSR risk to be with them, so I don't want to contradict it with the rep. I'll review the LLC agreement next.
