"Clark, My meeting with Mark was a big yawn. He took the all to sensible approach and decided he ought to read the Memo first and get back to me. I imagine I'll hear from him later tonight or tomorrow. In the meantime, the following sets of coal and ash handling agreements have arrived from ReUse Technology's Kris Johnson. Gerald Nemec, who works in my Group has been assisting Dwight Beach with this portion of the project. He has alot of other work on his plate and is trying to recover from the flu, so we need your help. I would appreciate your reviewing or having someone review the attached and give Gerald a call at 33512. The principal concerns that I know to have is that the current drafts are taken from what were intercompany contracts between Cogentrix and this ReUse affiliate; thus, the contract may lack the protections that a service recipient should receive. If there is a waiver of consequentials provision in these contracts, I would question whether that is to the benefit of a fee paying service recipient. Also, since we don't know how long Enron will be involved in the ownership of the plants, the termination provisions need to be particularly flexible. Finally, I will be sending you a rough draft of an O&M Agreement that Gerald prepared for use in negotiating a transaction with Jerry Campbell (of Power Systems) new O&M Company.

"Barbara, Attached is the Memorandum Of Agreement referenced in my voicemail to you of 10:15 a.m. today. The Turbine sale is to be documented by an Asset Purchase Agreement attached as Exhibit E--it is very vanilla from a Seller's perspective and should be easy to negotiate into final form. As mentioned in my voicemail, the only legal issue I have with the Barge Sale portion of the document is Section 12 (b), the Indemnification Clause which does not indemnify ENA for third party claims arising out of BargeCo's breach of the contract. A reasonable compromise, in my opinion, would be to require Bargeco to indemnify us against third party claims for which there is no specifically identified remedy (such as delay damages or MW buydown damages) in the Memorandum of Agreement. This would take care of most LIPA risks. Aside from the foregoing, I'm happy with the document. Now Ron and Curly Baca have to come to terms on (i) the 90/10 Price payment timing; (ii) the $1,000,000 in spares that Ron thought he was buying and (iii) whether the is a purchase price adjustment if the barges test out at less than 66 MW of capacity.

"Steve, I really need the Oasis and PGE transport contracts assigned to HPL by July 2000. Currently, we are buying gas in the Waha region as HPLC. But since our transport is under ENA, we have to enter an additional transaction where HPL sales the gas to ENA at the point of purchase. ENA then transports the gas to a delivery point. If the gas is sold to another counterparty, an additional transaction between ENA and HPL must be entered at the delivery point. This causes great difficulty in balancing out the pipelines and completing the scheduling in reasonable time. Plus, it just doesn't make sense to keep the transport under ENA since we transact all other deals as HPLC. Please let me know when we can get these contracts assigned. Thanks for your help.

"Here are the one's I know about. Nacogdoches Gathering System - I have no idea why this should be excluded. It should go with the HPL assets Matagorda Terminal - I have already given Pat Johnson the low-down on this asset. There is a possibility that Panther Pipeline is going to buy this asset. Pat has my list of the previous suitors. Crawfish Plant Sale - You need to see Jack Siminek about this. We still have some clean up work to do for Bridgeline to have access to this site before it is sold to a third party. Maybe Bridgeline would like to buy it. Napoleonville Salt Dome - We just sold one small tract to Texas Brine. These assets were not contributed to Bridgeline but are in the name of LRCI, Inc. Enron #1 Storage Well - This stays with LRCI until the brining operation is completed, then it will go to Bridgeline. Idled Meters - I'm already preparing a Bill of Sale (for zero consideration) to give these 40 meters to Bridgeline.

This should be a very simple product. At this point we don't need anything to feed back from EOL to Sitara at all. The product can easily be added on the current gas screen with no new fields at all on the front screen. We will explain the product in detail in the Product Description. The attachment below shows an example of how the fields would look for the product, and a first draft at a Product Description. I have only done a description of one product--at this time I am aware of three different products like this. Gerald, Steve-- I have made a feeble attempt at a Product Description--it obviously needs one of you to ""fix it up"". We can discuss my intent after you have had a chance to review it.

"Thanks for the info! As Greg mentioned in the staff meeting today, the intent is that this restructured deal is papered effective 4/1/00. The impact is potentially that the gas is not pathed properly by counterparty or on the appropriate transport/gathering agreements, etc. If any rates are changing, then those need to be changed in our systems also. There may be other areas of changes also - I'm not attempting to list them all. Rather I just want to make people aware that retroactive deals can have impacts on the daily operations.

"Steve, I really need the Oasis and PGE transport contracts assigned to HPL by July 2000. Currently, we are buying gas in the Waha region as HPLC. But since our transport is under ENA, we have to enter an additional transaction where HPL sales the gas to ENA at the point of purchase. ENA then transports the gas to a delivery point. If the gas is sold to another counterparty, an additional transaction between ENA and HPL must be entered at the delivery point. This causes great difficulty in balancing out the pipelines and completing the scheduling in reasonable time. Plus, it just doesn't make sense to keep the transport under ENA since we transact all other deals as HPLC. Please let me know when we can get these contracts assigned. Thanks for your help.

"Here are the one's I know about. Nacogdoches Gathering System - I have no idea why this should be excluded. It should go with the HPL assets Matagorda Terminal - I have already given Pat Johnson the low-down on this asset. There is a possibility that Panther Pipeline is going to buy this asset. Pat has my list of the previous suitors. Crawfish Plant Sale - You need to see Jack Siminek about this. We still have some clean up work to do for Bridgeline to have access to this site before it is sold to a third party. Maybe Bridgeline would like to buy it. Napoleonville Salt Dome - We just sold one small tract to Texas Brine. These assets were not contributed to Bridgeline but are in the name of LRCI, Inc. Enron #1 Storage Well - This stays with LRCI until the brining operation is completed, then it will go to Bridgeline. Idled Meters - I'm already preparing a Bill of Sale (for zero consideration) to give these 40 meters to Bridgeline. I'm working with Steve Schneider, Gerald Lofton and Nathan Hlavaty on this transfer. Crain Brothers Easements - We've received the alignment drawings and I will be preparing a conveyance from LRCI, Inc. to the Assumption Parish Police Jury.
