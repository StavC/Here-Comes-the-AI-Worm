If it is really problematic to get another 2 copies signed, I can ask them again if they will accept a copy. I appreciate that there are only 2 parties to the document, but the lenders' reasoning is that the Letter Agreement is a key underlying document and as such, they would expect to have an original. Also, our original arrangement was that we would sign 6 originals of each relevant document so that all parties could have originals. I know what a pain it is to get documents re-executed and I apologize that this request has come so late in the day.

If it is really problematic to get another 2 copies signed, I can ask them again if they will accept a copy. I appreciate that there are only 2 parties to the document, but the lenders' reasoning is that the Letter Agreement is a key underlying document and as such, they would expect to have an original. Also, our original arrangement was that we would sign 6 originals of each relevant document so that all parties could have originals. I know what a pain it is to get documents re-executed and I apologize that this request has come so late in the day.

Our credit documentation provides that Pegasus shall not cause any monies to be released from the Turbine Escrow Account until all relevant documentation has been executed and delivered, namely: (i) GE consent (ii) GE opinion (iii) Turbine Contract (iv) Security Agreement (v) Promissory Note (vi) Amended Salmon LLC Agreement (vii) GE Parent Guarantee. The lenders consequently expect to see an executed (faxed if necessary) copy of all of the above (including the GE Parent Guarantee) prior to release of funds from the Escrow Account.
