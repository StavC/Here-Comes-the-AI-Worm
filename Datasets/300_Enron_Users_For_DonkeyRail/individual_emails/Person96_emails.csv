"This is a follow-up to my e-mail sent June 23rd. We are gearing up to release the above referenced Product. Matt - I need a Sigma Factor please; there will be one Product Type for each of the 'flexible' scenario's (i) not less than three day, not less than 5 day, not less than 10 day: Country: USA Commodity: US Nat Gas UoM: MMBtu Product Type: Physical Index (Flexible) We are close to a final draft f the Product Description that will hit the website. The laymans description of the Product is as follows: Buyer and Seller exchange gas during the month of June 2000. Seller receives 10,000 MMBtu per day (or 300,000 total MMBtu) at TCO Pool Index. Buyer has the right to notify Seller of when Buyer wants to take delivery during the month of June, and may take delivery in one of three forms: not less than 3-day delivery, not less than 5-day delivery, or not less than 10-day delivery (depending on Product Type). The gas nominated for each such day would be between Zero and not greater than the percentage of the total 300,000 MMBtu based on the number of days of 'flexibility' (i.e.; Buyer chooses 5 days for nomination, Seller would deliver not more than 20% of the 300,000 MMBtu on each of those 5 days for a total nom of 100%). Buyer pays TCO Pool Index PLUS a premium. While the product Description on the website accounts for both the month-long delivery to the Seller and the 'flexibility' of the Buyer, the product should be entered",dale.neuner@enron.com,"scott.mills@enron.com, imelda.frayre@enron.com, larrissa.sharma@enron.com,

"Janine - I have speaking with the FX desk about the status o the roll-out of the Currency Exchange products on EnronOnline, and apparently they are a little frustrated; they continue to reiterate that what they are trying to accomplish Online is the same kind of transactions that they currently do over the phone. That being the case, I asked for an example of a Confirmation of such a transaction. Attached please find a confirmation between RMT and ETRIC dated July 10, 2000. Laurel Adams of the FX documentation unit explains that Trena McFarland, a trader in the UK, regularly does non-proprietary FX transactions on the behalf of RMT. Laurel has been assured that this is appropriate, but we a re unable to locate any clear 'policy' or 'instruction' in this regard. So, we either have a situation where this issue is being handled inappropriately on the FX desk and needs to be corrected for their OTC transactions as well as EOL, or there's some loophole or other piece of information that is missing from the equation we are trying to solve for. I think it goes without saying that, whatever the case, we at EOL will follow the lead given by our Tax and Legal Departments - and I would hope that we will find a quick, AND FINAL, resolution.

David will also be checking on the issue that I mentioned to you about the number of characters that can be put in the Volume and Price feilds in the Stack Manager.

"The Product is as follows: William Stuart on the FX desk will offer the Product to Enron canada Corp on an internal basis only. The GTC will be an 'internal only' GTC that we use that tells any external customer that may inadvertantly access the internal trade that the transaction is freserved for internal trading only; the only radio button will be a ""REJECT GTC"", which further prevents an external customer from transacting. Stuart will post a Fixed Price price that represents the USD/CAD Exchange rate on Trade Date. The Fixed Amount will be a CAD amount equal to volume multiplied by Fixed Price. The Floating Amount will be a CAD Amount equal to the volume multiplied by the Index, where the Index is a Floating Price equal to the USD/CAD.

That being the case, I asked for an example of a Confirmation of such a transaction. Attached please find a confirmation between RMT and ETRIC dated July 10, 2000.

Laurel has been assured that this is appropriate, but we a re unable to locate any clear 'policy' or 'instruction' in this regard. So, we either have a situation where this issue is being handled inappropriately on the FX desk and needs to be corrected for their OTC transactions as well as EOL, or there's some loophole or other piece of information that is missing from the equation we are trying to solve for.

"I concur that the proposed EOL FX trades are essentially replicating offline internal transactions. I have been out of the office for 3 days, but as far as I am concerned the position is still as previously stated: London: the principal for the London FX desk internal transactions is RMT acting through its agent EEFT (The current services agreement between ENA and EEFT will need to be amended to RMT/EEFT). I have also independently confirmed that confirms are being issued in the name of RMT. Japan: we are still in discussion with Susan Musch and Jeff Blumenthal, but in a nutshell it is looking like the principal for the Tokyo desk transactions will need to be Enron Japan Corp KK, and the transaction will then need to be backed into RMT (margin to be left in Enron japan Corp KK).

"Tax: The Enron entity executing the FX transaction as principal is ENA. However, note that for tax/legal the FX desk in London is run by Enron Europe Finance & Trading Limited (""EEFT"") as agent for ENA. Our position is that ENA does not have a place of business in London. Therefore all the transactions managed by the London FX desk are arranged by EEFT as agent for ENA. Because of this there is a need to identify which FX desk arranged the transaction and a possible solution to this is to have separate logins and logoffs for each FX desk during their hours of responsibility. This would enable transaction reports to be run which identify those transactions which took place during the period for which each FX desk was responsible for managing the FX positions.

"Dale --- In answer to you questions: a.) We have traded this directly before and have just looked at it as two individual deals....a baseload purchase at index, and a sale at index plus some number with daily nom flex of zero to whatever is negotiated as the daily max. Example: Sitara deals #246931 and #246926 b.) These would definitely be separate products priced separately. I would expect a 3-day, 5-day, and 10-day product with a different two-way for each. c.) Hopefully the other answers help here. d.) To the extent that the deals are like the ones I mentioned in a.), can they bridge to Sitara (at least the baseload piece)? e.) We'll have to decide at what time the customer would have to give notice (for now let's assume 9:30 am central). The customer can make the nomination daily and would only need to notify us if they/we are going to take the gas under the second part of the deal (the non-baseload). In other words, the default would be zero, unless the customer or Enron (whoever bought the service) nominates by 9:30 am. FYI, the expectation is that there would be 3 products (at this point). The 3-day would naturally be more expensive than the 10-day. If you have any questions, please let me know. I'm hoping, that if we view the product as two separate deals, that will make things much easier system-wise.

"Just a couple of comments and questions: Is it appropriate to refer to these as ""US"" transactions since the prices are clearly from outside the US? I recognize that ENA is the counterparty but I think this may be confusing to our customers. The term Business Day should be capitalized (it's defined in the GTC) [but it's defined with reference to NY & Houston banks being open - does that work for pulp transactions?]. I'm not thrilled with the language for the last ten days of the contract period on the Pulpex description - is that what we use for current confirmations? In the definition of the Index for the Finnish product, the word ""relevent"" should be deleted.

"""Tentatively approved"" means that we should assume that Tenaska will be granted full approval unless we hear otherwise from Debbie, Bill, or Jason Williams by COB Thursday. Please mail the letter and UserID out to Tenaska today. I have set up the counterparty in CL system with appropriate interest rates and privileges, and you guys in PCG should set up the user as usual in the CL system. I really appreciate everyone's speed on this issue; I believe that there is a good chance Tenaska will want to transact on Friday. I told them the earliest they would be able to do so was Friday, pending our usual setup processes and credit check. thanks again! doug Dale Neuner @ ECT 01/17/2001 02:21 PM To: Debbie R Brackett/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: Andrea Crump/NA/Enron@ENRON, Jason R Williams/NA/Enron@ENRON, Douglas Fuehne/NA/Enron@ENRON Subject: Re: Credit Verification Debbie - Does 'tentatively approved' mean that we should not grant Tenaska access until we hear from you tomorrow?
