"Rick - As we discussed, I have an outstanding tax liability with the Australian government, and I need your help in this matter. Working for Enron Ex-Pat Services, I incurred additional tax liabilities which Enron was to pay on my behalf. In simple terms, Enron agreed to make up the difference between my U.S. income tax liability and that charged by Australia. My full U.S. tax liability was withheld from my paychecks and Enron was to make up the difference between this and the 48% charged by the Australian government. As of today, the incremental tax liability has not been addressed by Enron, and I need to resolve this issue immediately. It appears that the easiest solution is for Enron Corp. to wire Enron Australia the estimated tax liability, with Enron Australia passing the money to the Australian tax authority. I will have the final estimate from PWC first thing Monday morning, but it has been indicated that the liability in total will be less than $50,000 U.S.. I appreciate any help you can provide in getting this matter resolved. I will provide you the specific estimates Monday morning, and in the interim, if there is anything else you need from me, I am at your disposal.

"Team, I have had a few conversations over the past couple of days with Terry Brownrigg at Twister Gas Services, LLC and Todd Tharp with Sanguine, Ltd.. We transacted with Twister last week and I had sent you a credit worksheet for the transaction. Twister is a broker who transacts on behalf of small E&P companies, and in this case, the E&P agreed to post the L/C we quoted for the transaction. After talking to Sara, it sounds like we are going to go ahead and send a confirmation to Twister for the deal and attach to the confirmation an assignment of the deal from Twister to Sanguine. It is my understanding that both Terry and Todd will need to sign both the confirmation and the assignment, so I think we will need to carefully coordinate the steps through the Confirmation Desk (Sheetal Patel).

However, their exposure is well above the contractual threshold ($6.5MM credit line versus $12MM exposure) and we are not collateralized for the amount of exposure above the credit line. So, as a result, we want to approve them for online trading, but we actually do not want them to be able to complete any transactions. The counterparty has requested approval, and Fred Lagrasta has asked that we approve them so they can get online and see the stacks. Credit does not want them to complete trades, so we need to set a very low credit line for online trading so when the counterparty attempts to trade (if they attempt to trade), is turned down.

"EOL Team, Please approve the above mentioned for online trading for financial oil and gas in the U.S. only. We have a Master Swap contract with these guys, and they are an ESP. However, their exposure is well above the contractual threshold ($6.5MM credit line versus $12MM exposure) and we are not collateralized for the amount of exposure above the credit line. So, as a result, we want to approve them for online trading, but we actually do not want them to be able to complete any transactions. The counterparty has requested approval, and Fred Lagrasta has asked that we approve them so they can get online and see the stacks. Credit does not want them to complete trades, so we need to set a very low credit line for online trading so when the counterparty attempts to trade (if they attempt to trade), is turned down. If this is not possible, please ket me know so I can get back with Fred and the counterparty.

"Dear John (and Sara this is a follow-up from my email to you of this morning our time), I think Morten-Eric is planning to call you again tomorrow morning and he may mention this but I am still trying to work out the best way to move forward on this. I have also today spoken with David Minns to see if he has done anything like this before. Having today had a closer look at the provisions you included and especially the three at the end (outstanding swap transactions, swaps to roll up under new master and credit provision of master to govern), I am a bit confused. Morten did say that you had said that these could be deleted but I wanted to make sure we were on the same track. In simple terms, this transaction with Nippon Chemi-con is a simple stand alone agreement to supply physical power. (There is not even an option for financial settlement in this one - although there will be in later ones). From the credit terms you have proposed I wonder whether you are thinking that we need a credit support annex or something similar because it will not be enough just to put in those terms you have included, additional provisions will be required so that those terms can work (and we don't have a master so we don't already have any of those). If so, I guess we need to link a CSA into the power contract. If Sara has done this before or can email me something along these lines I am very happy to have a go at it. If on the other hand this is less of an ISDA related issue (which I am starting to ",jane.mcbride@enron.com,john.suttle@enron.com,"'John' : 'person', 'Sara' : 'person', 'email' : 'email', 'Morten-Eric' : 'person', 'David Minns' : 'person', 'Sara' : 'person', 'email' : 'email'",7,Re: credit for Nippon Chemi-con,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,received,john.suttle@enron.com

We can put back VI(c)(i) but the reason that we deleted it was because the provisions in VI(c)(ii) and VI(E) really deal with how an LC can be drawn upon and the language in VI(c)(i) seemed unnecessary and perhaps inconsistent with those sections. If we put it back in, it should be made subject to those other sections. 2. With respect to your points regarding the amount that can be drawn, I am unclear as to what your position is. In one place you want to limit it to amounts owed and in another you want to limit it to Exposure Amount. What is your position. We thought that the formula that we set forth in Section 4(b) of the amendment was what everyone had agreed to. 3. The reason for the change in E.4.(c) is because the Event of Default situation has already been addressed in VI(c)(ii). 4. I need to check with our credit people regarding the transferability issue. I will note that the current form that is attached to the Master permits transfers. Why is this an issue with you? I look forward to hearing from you. My number is 713-853-3989.

Bill Bradford mentioned that I might want to bring you up to speed on some of the recent developments in that office. Though much of the background information is probably old news for you, there are some issues that might come up in your meeting. As you know, Enron Japan has made the move from Power to Global Markets. To date, Enron Japan has not submitted proposals for new VaR limits or products, but I believe their meetings with the Houston management this week are to determine such. I think by the end of the week, they will have a better idea of what exactly they will trade, what limits they will want trade under, the systems they will need to implement, etc. Last week, the commercial team discussed with me the possibilities of trading petrochemicals through a new exchange - The Tokyo Commodities Exchange. To jumpstart the Global Markets business, the team intends to be quite active on the exchange, trading Gasoline and Kerosene.

"John: I was reviewing an amendment that Susan bailey was working on concerning the ISDA Master between ECC and Petro Canada and wanted to make sure that you were comfortable leaving as is the following provisions that are in the Schedules: 1. They have amended the definition of Specified Indebtedness. I'm not sure I understand why if we have a threshold amount they need the first part of the language and wanted your thoughts on this. Alos, does the second part of the language need to be updated or revised in any manner? 2. They have deleted the concept of Credit event Upon Merger. 3. They have added to Specified Transaction a Physical Master Agreement which makes this part of the cross default to specified transaction Event of Default trigger. Should we specify a threshold? 4. They have added an additional termination event that contains some unusual ratings triggers. For example, are we rated by the 2 bond rating services that they describe, and if not, doesn't that trigger clause (2) of this additional Termination Event? I don;'t think the cure language works and I don't understand how it works with the collateral threshold since the trigger for that to go to zero is something else. 5. I'll just note that setoff rights do not currently apply if there is a Termination Event that is caused by Tax Event or Tax Event Upon Merger. 6.

"Dear John, I spoke with Sara this morning and she is going to speak with you again and send me some suggested language. I am a bit confused though and wonder if you can explain. When I first mentioned this to the bank I told them that as (if) their credit rating went down, their credit limit would drop (so by implication there would not necessarily be any event of default). Is this the case or would a drop in their credit rating from ""A"" automatically trigger an event of default. The former will of course make it much easier to sell them our proposal (involving us having the option to post collateral before there can be an event of default). Sorry if I sound a bit vague but this is all still a bit new to me. Secondly, we now have their replies to our comments on the various outstanding issues and I will forward these to you now for your input (including on the threshold amount point).
