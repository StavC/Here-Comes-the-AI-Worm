As the app is on the network in Houston I would think it would be fairly easy to ""recreate"" the script or whatever it is to work in London. I will leave all that in your capable hands.

Therefore, you may need to direct the Autex people to the Win 2K rollout team (I've been working with Judi Hemsley) to get it on my desktop.

I am working again with Gary's desk now that Shari has moved on to power trading (legal). My first task has been to reconcile the outstanding Sutton Bridge transactions. I find three: (1) Currency Swap between ECT and Sutton Bridge Financing Ltd: booked 5/22/97 [ 12/31/97 through 6/30/22] (2) Currency Swap between ECT and Sutton Bridge Power booked 1/28/97 [ through 4/29/11] (3) Currency Swap between ""ECT"" and ""Sutton Bridge"" booked 3/29/00 [ through 3/31/03]. I have only seen the ticket and not the confirm. I understand that all swap transactions are to be terminated with the pending Sutton Bridge sale. Are you terminating these three (3) trades? Are there others? What is the third trade which was booked last week (I don't know anything about it)? Someone should be documenting the termination and payout. Please let me know ASAP as the lawyers are headed to San Antonio tomorrow. Thanks.

"To my knowledge, we will trade these instruments via internal broker platforms (i.e., ENA traders will trade online rather than over the phone), such as Goldman Sachs, or directly over the phone. All trades will be confirmed either online or verbally and ENA will receive a daily statement reflecting trades done the previous day. ENA does not prepare a confirmation but will need to check out the broker statements.

I find three: (1) Currency Swap between ECT and Sutton Bridge Financing Ltd: booked 5/22/97 [ 12/31/97 through 6/30/22] (2) Currency Swap between ECT and Sutton Bridge Power booked 1/28/97 [ through 4/29/11] (3) Currency Swap between ""ECT"" and ""Sutton Bridge"" booked 3/29/00 [ through 3/31/03]. I have only seen the ticket and not the confirm. I understand that all swap transactions are to be terminated with the pending Sutton Bridge sale. Are you terminating these three (3) trades? Are there others? What is the third trade which was booked last week (I don't know anything about it)? Someone should be documenting the termination and payout.
