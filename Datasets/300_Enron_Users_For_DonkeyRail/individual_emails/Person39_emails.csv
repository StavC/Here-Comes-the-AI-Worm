"Yan, Based on my review conducted the morning of February 6th, here is a list of items that need to be addressed in the next version of the West Desk's Flow Summary sheet: PGT - These numbers appear to be one day off. The numbers in the Test Sheet for February 6th are identical to those used by the West Desk yesterday for February 5th. I verified that they are the Cycle 2 numbers posted on PGT's website for the 5th. Generally, we use the Cycle 2 numbers, however, sometimes only Cycle one is available for our morning meeting. Northwest - None of these numbers match our flow sheet. It appears the Test Sheet pulls Cycle 3 nominations, whereas we use Cycle 6. However, the website we use to pull the flows is generally not available to use until as late as 7 am (we are not sure why). I understand you may pull the numbers from a different place, so we should find out whether you can get the numbers earlier. TW - TW numbers appear to be correct, except for the IB Link number. We pull the IB link number from the El Paso Blanco I/C point reported by TW. It looks like your sheet pulls the number from the El Paso INWPLBLA point. They differ by about 5,000, but I don't know if one is more correct than the other. To be consistent, though, we should probably change the Test Sheet. PGE - The numbers also appear to be one day off.

The market tends to get really slow by 9:15, so by then, I'm ba= ck to a 2 cent two-way at keystone and a 3 cent two-way at the border. The= se markets will still be tighter than ICE.

"Hey Matteo, How's everything goin? SO, I am so pumped about Utah. I talked with my friend Jeff and he told me so much more about Park City, skiing there, where to go, the night life and the Sundance Festival. He is going to write up a bunch of stuff for us and would like to meet up with us for a day or two as well. We are planning on Martin Luther King weekend still?? I was thinking that maybe Brad and Heather might like to go as well. Sent out the invite to a few people, will know more by the end of the week. I say let's get the tickets and start planning. Once I get the specifics on ski places from Jeff, I'll have a better idea of where would be the best place to crash. By then maybe we will have a few more people commited and can make a decision. Sweet! Also, last night I brought up the idea (to Duncan) of going to Australia in February for a few weeks. I know that you and Jeff have been thinking about it. Just thought I would let you know that we are too. So, how did your weekend go with the chica???? love, k _________________________________________________________________ Get your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer.msn.com/intl.asp",ksiles@hotmail.com,matt.smith@enron.com,"'Matteo' : 'person', 'Jeff' : 'person', 'Brad' : 'person', 'Heather' : 'person', 'Jeff' : 'person', 'Duncan' : 'person', 'Jeff' : 'person'",7,"trips, chixs and other fancy things",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,received,matt.smith@enron.com
