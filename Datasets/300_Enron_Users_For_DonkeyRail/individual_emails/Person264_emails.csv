Here is what he wants to cover. List of trader responsibilities by pipe and point (Scott will do this) List of Logistics responsibilities by pipe (we do this) How will the business be different, only pool transactions? (open discussion) Talk about IT and short term Park and Loans and how that will be managed (open discussion) Emphasis on data collection and pipeline and market intelligience,OFO's, capacity constraints, LDC and other info. (open discussion) In addition, Scott really wants to set expectations and some ground rules. Can you get the guys focused on this, have them review and pull the necessary info? Also probably makes sense to spend a few minutes on deal entry so we all hear from the start who is expected to do what. That might be something Clarissa can pull together.

"Sally, some thoughts/ideas that I thought about after your meeting. Lets promote the positive - some very exciting things are happening such as the move to the new building, lets make sure we get the PR out there to talk about the new features, move in plans, etc. I know security is tight but how about a mini open house. At this point it would do us good to go beyond the ""Building Guy"". I know I get excited whenever I'm over there. Things like vendors in the lobby to push new technology etc. I believe it's important to keep that almost ""electric"" atmosphere that surrounds the company. Lets show our employees that our outside business relationships are as strong as ever and our vendors/business partners still view Enron as someone they are eager to continue doing business with. I always get charged up when the lobby is full of activity. Keeps the pulse of Enron at a high level. Get some fun things out there, things the employees can purchase, electronic devices are always attractive. Work out a decent discount to make it exciting. Give it a holiday twist. Even if it costs us a few bucks to make that happen might be worth it. Make a push to host more industry meetings (GISB is one that I can help with). Lets get our counterparties in here and let them know nothing has changed. We can include mini tours of the new building to get the word back on the street about how we might be down but boy are we poised to grow, grow and grow some more.

"I need the following........ Assume we are in the new building and we have technical problems that force us out of the building either due to IT connection issues or problems with the building itself (AC, power, etc.). If we do have to leave the plan is to have the 30th floor completely available in this building as a backup for both the gas and power side. Obviously space is limited so what we will do is only bring the people that need to be in the building to get noms out and send the others home to handle business remotely. One approach is to take the EDI pipes and have them go to the 30th floor to ensure they have the support and quicker system then if they did their noms from home. Using this approach, and considering the space constraint please give me the number of desks you will need on the 30th floor.

"As you might already know we had to reschedule our second meeting that was scheduled for Wednesday 2/16 to Tuesday 2/22 in room 3013. Lunch will be provided. I apologize and will avoid rescheduling our meetings in the future. I was encouraged by the excellent dialogue and contribution at our first meeting and believe we have the right group together to make the changes we know are needed in our work hours. Here is the list of items we agreed to cover at the next meeting: Schedulers were going to touch base with their pipeline reps and other contacts on the different schedules they are using and document and discuss at the next meeting. Each manager was going to discuss with their group what would work best for their desk and present this to the group at our next meeting Bob was going to gather information on external 12 hour schedules and follow up with HR on schedules being used at Enron The following is what I heard at the first meeting: Our first item should be to establish a weekend and holiday schedule that would more or less guarantee (other than maybe an occasional call) you have the weekend off. Cross-training seemed to be the key here. Some desks seemed to doubt this could be accomplished with current staffing levels. Cross-training is not an easy thing to accomplish and takes a ""just do it"" attitude. There doesn't have to be an across the board solution for Logistics.

"Wanted to share the latest communication on NETCO. This is all good news and exciting to see that things will be moving on a fast track from this point forward. I will be pulling you together and asking for some information to meet the plans and deadlines listed below. For a start please review your pipe coverage that is planned on your desk with the NETCO team you will have to work with and forward me that breakdown. I know you took a preliminary look at this but I want you all to rethink and give me a ""final or startup"" list. The list you gave me on the contracts required for NETCO on the pipelines has been consolidated and is being reviewed. I believe we need to take a look at some of the Intrastates and key LDC's and get that info on the list. Seating plan should be simple once we get a better handle on the layout for 5 & 6. I'll try and get some details today. Don't know if we will be allocated spots on 6. IT systems layout and structure is already being planned/discussed. Most likely we will get involved in some testing once they start laying out the new architecture. In addition any other items for a re-start that you can think of please forward to me. Of course we still have the major hurdle of securing a buyer and once/if we do what do they actually submit a bid to purchase. Let's be optimistic and hope they are interested in the NETCO structure that has been laid out. Regardless we still need to do all of the tasks listed below to get ready.

"Bob: per your request, here is the rundown on Patti's activities for August and beyond. 1. We calculated the amount we made on her experience in handling El Paso's transport to be close to $1 million/ month. 2. I could not even begin to calculate the amount made just by having her here. If Patti had just quit with everyone else gone, the amount lost on El Paso would be huge, including loss of credibility on our part with our customers. The exact amount would be close to $1 million/month I would think. 3. The spreads out West have been huge this summer. We were able to take advantage of this because Patti was here to do the scheduling during a very difficult time. 4. When I was out for the entire month of August, Patti was not only holding down a desk that usually three people handle, but was also filling in on management duties. 5. Patti worked 14 weeks in a row, including weekends, without taking a day off. She worked at least 12 hours a day during this time, handling several different jobs at a time. 6.

"Actually, prior to the CES acquisition we had between 200 and 500 little wells of metered production in the Appalachian area of our own. These wells produce anywhere from 10 dt's to 10,000 dt's per day. Most are very minimal, probably 500 dt's or less. This production is produced on several gathering lines off of CNG and Columbia Gas. A couple of years ago Columbia Gas started getting out of the gathering business and sold part of the wells to Gatherco, then they spun off part to CNR, and the remainder are still held by Columbia Gas. Around the 10th of the month we get estimates from Gatherco and CNR as to what it appears that the individual wells are producing and then we nominate the gas, which takes up to several hours of updating time. The Columbia Gas meters we do not have to individually nominate to the pipe. We receive an estimate from the pipe for the total volume and they give us credit for it in our pool. Sounds simple. The problem comes three months down the road when we get the actuals from Columbia Gas as to what flowed at these meters and accounting has to go in and make payments to all these little producers. Prior to unify, it didn't really effect us. Client Services would just zero out the one lump estimate that we had made and then they would go in and add each producer, the wells that flowed, the volume and make the final payment to each. It was a very time consuming process and they had one person who was solely devoted",katherine.kelly@enron.com,robert.superty@enron.com,'one person' : 'person',1,Re: Accounting stuff.
