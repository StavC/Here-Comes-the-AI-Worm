"This arrived today. This FERC data request is due Monday April 16 and requests ""copies of all short-term and long-term bilateral contracts for electricity which such seller has entered into with DWR subsequent to the December 15 Order."" I am inquiring with Jeff Richter and Christian Yoder to get the necessary data. If you have information that would be responsive to this request, please call me ASAP. Alan Comnes 95 FERC ? 61,058 FEDERAL ENERGY REGULATORY COMMISSION WASHINGTON, D.C. 20426 April 12, 2001 Docket Nos. EL00-95-027 and EL00-98-026 To: Companies Listed On The Attachment Dear Sir/Madam: On December 15, 2000, the Commission issued an order in this proceeding directing remedies to address dysfunctions in spot markets operated in California and to ensure just and reasonable wholesale power rates by public utility sellers in California. San Diego Gas & Electric Co., et al., 93 FERC ? 61,294 (2000). Several of the key elements of that order were intended to remove barriers to entering into long-term contracts. The Commission now seeks information to determine how successful efforts have been to fashion long-term contracts and to reduce reliance on spot markets. In addition, we note that at a hearing held by the Committee on Government Reform of the United States House of Representatives on April 10, 2001, in Sacramento, California, the Committee requested that the Commission provide information on bilateral contracts for sales to the California Department of Water Resources (DWR), which has been negotiating such contracts with suppliers on behalf of end-users in California.

We focus a bit more on the lack of definition of a congestion management plan as well as hit on ""hints"" of where WestConnect is probably going to stay (contract path) based upon some clues in the filing. We focus more on existing contracts (lack of conversion) as well as additional comments on the planning appendix.

"The Joskow/Kahn paper raises two issues: price above cost and witholding. Enron obviously has concerns with the ""price above cost"" analysis. I drafted some specific concerns and put them into a draft to Enron's reponse to Hoeker Question 1. Although the detail was dropped in the final draft, the basic technical concerns were laid out there. To really rebut Joskow/Kahn would take considerable work. Jeff D's idea was to write a paper that raised issues and indicated how complicated a ""correct"" response would be. The Joskow/Kahn withholding section has recieved criticism from the ISO so I am not sure Enron needs to respond to that. I think my bottom line now is that the debate at FERC will soon be over or enter a new stage on the 13th. As far as how a response would help us in California, I think requires a discussion with Jeff.

"If you've been wondering where Davis's $9 billion ""overcharge number"" number comes from, attached is the apparent basis of the number, which was from a study prepared by Hildebrandt of the CAISO. It was apparently released on the CAISO site on 6/21. Note that the $9billion includes bilateral trade sold to any party. However, Hildebrandt cannot say who the supplier is unless DWR, CAISO, or the PX was the buyer (for those buyers he presumably has detailed data). Thus, he can ascribe overcharges to specific jurisdictional generators for only $5.4 billion of the $9billion total. He does not show what specific parties are attrributable to the $5.4 billion. In an earlier study on just ISO R/T ""strategic bidding"", supplier names were released inadvertantly by CAISO. Finally, as in previous CAISO studies, a significant fraction of overcharges (approx $3 billion) comes from before the refund-effective date of 10/1/00.

"Send to your favorite counterparty. Enron Receives Dynegy $1.5B Cash Infusion Tues. >DYN ENE By Christina Cheddar 11/14/2001 Dow Jones News Service (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Dynegy Inc. (DYN) provided Enron Corp. (ENE) Tuesday with the $1.5 billion cash infusion envisioned in the companies' merger agreement, a Dynegy spokeswoman said. Dynegy received preferred stock and other rights in an Enron unit that owns the Northern Natural Gas pipeline in return for its investment. The cash infusion, which was made with the assistance of Dynegy's largest shareholder, ChevronTexaco Corp. (CVX), is aimed at providing Enron with additional cash liquidity to support its core energy marketing and trading operations. The rights provide Dynegy with the option to acquire the pipeline unit should the two companies fail to complete their merger. The deal, which still needs shareholder and regulatory approval, is expected to close within the next six to nine months. Dynegy is acquiring Enron for 0.2685 of a Dynegy share, or about $10 billion based on the recent price of Dynegy shares. The acquisition of Enron by its smaller rival follows a series of disclosures about Enron's financial dealings with partnerships run by some of its corporate officers. The dealings are under investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission and at the center of more than a dozen of shareholder lawsuits.

"Traders et al: This is the best article I saw on what the FERC may do on Monday. We are hopeful (and doing lobbying to push for) for no action outside of California, given the unworkability and meaningless-ness of price controls outside of CA. This is an effort and not a promise, of course. Some action in CA seems more than 50-50 likely and the best bet seem to be extending the current proxy mitigation to all hours. The article below raises the possibility of reissuing the refund orders (recall that they began in March 01 for the month of January 01) to cover all hours and not just during Stage 3. Such reissued refund order could extend back to Oct 00.

By RICARDO ALONSO-ZALDIVAR, Times Staff Writer WASHINGTON--The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, responding to pressure from lawmakers, state officials and consumers, is considering a significant expansion of its plan to limit California electricity prices this summer, senior agency officials said Tuesday. Commissioners and staff members are engaged in intense negotiations in advance of a key meeting Monday to finalize an emergency plan for California and the West.

"FERC has set a meeting for Monday18 June 10 am PDT wherein it has noticed its California and WSCC-wide dockets.

Expect FERC to respond to intense political pressure to expand its current price mitigation measures, possibly to a WSCC-wide scope or to all hours, or both.

The commission's meeting notice provides no details, except to list for discussion four cases involving price mitigation in, and the structure of, volatile power markets in California and 10 other Western states. The meeting comes as members of Congress are placing enormous political pressure on the commission to take more drastic action to contain runaway electricity prices in the region. Last week, House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt, D-Mo., joined 21 Western-state congressional lawmakers to request an opportunity to appear before the commission to argue their case for cost-based price controls in the region's electricity markets.

Also, gas-indexed contracts were examined on their nongas costs only. Since gas costs are a pass through on some contracts, we excluded them as a conservatism; i.e., we did not ascribe costs to the gas portion of the contracts since they will float with market costs over time.

"Today's FERC meeting was a big deal. Some of the key actions are: DSTAR and RTO West are to be ""married,"" The FERC wants a single western RTO but will wait on making CAISO merge with other western RTOs so that California can ""heal its wounds."" Every utility needs to declare which RTO it plans to join by 12/1/01 (or possibly 12/15; not sure of date). Otherwise the utility will lose market-based rates, will be unable to get a merger approved, and will have its transmission rev req. scrutinized. The commission favors 1 market structure applied to the four nationwide RTOs. It plans on holding a week of workshops and issuing a NOPR to determine this structure. The goal is to essentially re-issue the Order 888 tariff in a form that encompases the new functions of RTOs. Although consistent business rules applied to large geographic markets are a good thing, expect this new effort and redefining the RTO to delay ultimate implementation. Although California will be allowed to heal, it is ordering an operational audit of the Calfornia ISO. Separately the FERC indicated the plan to issue a NOPR on market power and market based rates. Expect new rules and procedure to determine whether a market is sufficiently competitive to allow for market based rates. Further summary, prepared by Sarah Novosel in our Govt.

"This one is particularly amazing ... Electricity traders' tech habits get scrutiny Posted at 10:23 p.m. PDT Sunday, June 10, 2001 BY JENNIFER BJORHUS Mercury News State officials investigating California's extraordinary energy prices are zeroing in on how energy traders use the technology tools of their profession -- from e-mail and specialized software to Internet energy data sites and online trading floors. This technology may be key, they say, to helping traders acquire the intimate knowledge needed to manipulate California's troubled energy market. With minute-to-minute knowledge of market conditions, some traders went even further, two lawsuits charge, illegally coordinating bids and sending electricity prices to record-breaking levels. The state Attorney General's Office has subpoenaed from power generators software used to formulate bidding strategies, names of employees providing computer support, communications with a prominent industry Web site and the name of firms that handle computer networks. And a state Senate committee has hired an information technology consultant to help them look into how traders tracked patterns on the state's Internet-based spot market, among other things. ``Once you were knowledgeable about its operations, the opportunity to game it became pretty obvious,'' said Sen. Joe Dunn, D-Garden Grove, who chairs the committee. Anti-trust laws Working together, or colluding, to fix prices is illegal and violates state and federal anti-trust laws.

"January 23, 2002 Dow Jones Newswires Calif Attorney Genl Says Likely To File More Energy Suits Dow Jones Newswires SAN FRANCISCO (AP)--California Attorney General Bill Lockyer said Wednesday he is likely to file more unfair business practice lawsuits against energy suppliers he thinks overcharged for electricity. But Lockyer, in a telephone interview, said after a yearlong investigation he has found no criminal wrongdoing by any energy suppliers. He said he has discovered possible civil violations of California consumer laws prohibiting overcharging - violations that carry no jail or prison time. Lockyer's disclosure came a week after the state's top law enforcement official sued Pacific Gas and Electric Corp., the parent to Pacific Gas and Electric Co., for allegedly siphoning billions from its underling and forcing it to seek federal bankruptcy protection. The PG&E suit is ""the first of many I would expect in the energy area to overcome overcharges,"" Lockyer told The Associated Press. ""We've devoted a huge amount of investigative and lawyering time to get back the money...generators extracted from Californians,"" he added. Lockyer declined to name other companies that he would sue, but his office has subpoenaed records from Dynegy, Enron Corp., Mirant Corp. and Reliant Energy - all of which have denied wrongdoing. In the interview, the attorney general did mention Enron by name, saying ""we're still looking at the energy overcharges,"" and he accused Enron of withholding documents.

"Using information pulled together by Jennifer and BAN, I requested West Tradings Risk/Structuring Group do a more careful analysis of the above-market costs associated with the DWR contracts. Attached is their analysis. In this analysis we examined only the executed contracts and NOT the agreements-in principle. (Only executed contracts were released by the state in the last few weeks.) Also, gas-indexed contracts were examined on their nongas costs only. Since gas costs are a pass through on some contracts, we excluded them as a conservatism; i.e., we did not ascribe costs to the gas portion of the contracts since they will float with market costs over time. These contracts were marked to market using current, applicable curves. Finally we discounted at the LIBOR rate, which is around 4%/year. The stranded cost under these assumptions is approximately $10 billion. The spreadsheet shows the overmarket costs by contract. Note: a negative ""mark-to-market"" equals a positive stranded cost. As before, this analysis is based upon Enron's confidential forward curves. Approval from Tim Belden is needed before this analysis can be released.

"This article has the angle I spoke of on yesterday's call ... State reviews draft plan to prohibit energy exports Published Sunday, March 11, 2001, in the San Jose Mercury News BY STEVE JOHNSON Mercury News To the concern of some of its neighbors, California appears to be getting more serious about the idea of banning its electricity generators from selling to other states on days when power supplies here are critically short. A draft proposal to prohibit such exports was circulated late last week by the California Independent System Operator, which oversees most of the state's power grid. Although officials there could not be reached for comment, the proposal said the agency plans to seek approval for the ban from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which supervises power wholesalers. The proposal would require California generators ``to make full capacity available'' to this state when electricity reserves dip below 7 percent, a condition that results in a Stage 1 emergency. Rolling blackouts can result after a Stage 3 emergency, when reserves fall below 1.5 percent. Gov. Gray Davis and other California officials have been mulling over the idea of such a ban for months. They are concerned about California's power being shipped elsewhere, particularly when the state is scrambling to find enough electricity to keep the lights on. A Mercury News analysis in December found that thousands of California-generated megawatts -- enough to supply several million homes -- were routinely being sold to other states during hours when power here was critically short. In addition, the draft proposal said banning exports could",alan.comnes@enron.com,"james.steffes@enron.com, harry.kingerski@enron.com, mark.palmer@enron.com,

"Steve, Dan W. et al: (Dan, can you make sure these charts get to Steve?) Attached are some updated charts that are more accurate with respect to Enron's current estimated cost of peakers in California. Costs are up and, to the extent you use these types of charts, you should use these updated ones. If you do not, this information will get attached somehow to our November 22 comments. In general, the higher the cost to build, the worse a price cap looks in terms of disincentives to pursue a project. Background on the Change: Our origination people (Chris Calger) inform us that building a peaker plant in California is now more expensive than Enron estimated back in August. These ""August"" numbers were circulated in a presentation by Tim Belden and were filed with the FERC. The peaker charts to reflect a 25% increase in capital costs. An increase in costs is due to things such as: longer development time (Cal ISO has dragged out the schedule) local permitting constraints (sound abatement, strict construction schedules) labor costs in California emission offset credit costs are higher than previously expected These higher costs, along with the uncertainty created by price caps, has caused Enron to stop pursuing certain peaker, including Pleasanton. Although price caps increases uncertainty and increases the cost of capital, I have not updated the charts to reflect a higher cost of capital as a conservatism.

Thanks, Alan Officials study grid's close call Published Friday, Aug. 10, 2001, in the San Jose Mercury News BY STEVE JOHNSON, JOHN WOOLFOLK AND GLENNDA CHUI Mercury News Two energy agencies announced Thursday that they are investigating charges some California generators have disregarded orders to provide electricity, and Atlanta-based Mirant admitted it had a role in last week's incident that briefly imperiled the Western power grid. California officials said two companies failed to deliver expected power on Aug. 2 and pushed the grid dangerously close to collapse, threatening outages on the electrical lifeline to 65 million people. But it could take state and federal officials some time to sort through conflicting accounts of what led to the power shortfall and how to prevent it from happening again. Some generators and a federal official questioned the California Independent System Operator's handling of the emergency and said the rules governing how power plants must respond to state orders for supplying electricity need to be clarified. But Stephanie McCorkle with the California agency said the incident was just the latest in a series in which generators didn't follow orders. And she said state officials are particularly troubled at the reasons some of the firms involved have offered for falling short on delivering promised electricity. ``We asked them over and over why they're not",alan.comnes@enron.com,"bill.williams@enron.com, dave.perrino@enron.com, ray.alvarez@enron.com,

I talked with staff on the West Desk and confirmed that if there is an unscheduled electricity curtailment (i.e., rolling or widespread blackout) power scheduled by EES to a retail customer would still flow, assuming it had been prescheduled. EPMI (acting as EES's scheduling coordinator, or SC) would be paid the ISO decremental (dec) price for that power. EPMI would pass that revenue (along with the cost of supplying that power) onto EES. If the blackout continued for some time (i.e., days), presumably EES would adjust its preschedule and there would be no net sales into the ISO. Whether the retail customer gets a payment for being curtailed depends completely on the contract between EES and the customer. Presumably the force majure provisions of the contract would protect EES from utility blackouts.

"The FERC order appears to be putting a significant crimp on the real time (R/T) desk of Enron and other marketers whenever market prices are at or near the cap. The initial west wide cap is approx $108 an we hit that today in R/T. Briefly: Marketers cannot sell above the cap. So when prices reach the cap, generators are on their own to find buyers. (Generators can sell above the cap; if the generator is thermal they simply make a end-of-month cost filing.) Marketers which provide an important function of making the market and providing transmission are simply shut out. Even if a marketer makes a deal below the cap, the deal could be cut due to transmission problems. Should the cost of replacement power exceed the cap (which can easily happen), the marketer may be left holding the bag because, again, the marketer cannot sell above the cap. When CAISO declares an emergency, the cap will change hourly. R/T deals are usually done several hours out. A marketer will essentially have no idea what the relevant cap will be when it is making its deal. Cash markets can also face all these same problems. However, the cash desks may be able to sell more than 24 hours out. Because these impacts are disproportionate on marketers, we should consider an appeal of this order separate from EPSA.

"Tuesday, June 12, 2001 Davis Eases Power Plant Pollution Rules Electricity: Order will allow more production from heavily polluting 'peaker' facilities. By DAN MORAIN, Times Staff Writer SACRAMENTO--Gov. Gray Davis agreed Monday to lift air emission limits on heavily polluting power plants and allow them to run at capacity this summer as long as the electricity they produce is sold in the state. State officials said the plants must be pressed into use to avoid blackouts. Davis' executive order lets the generators build the cost of air pollution fines into the price the state pays for electricity produced by natural gas-fired power plants, said Catherine Witherspoon of the California Air Resources Board. Municipal utility districts--including the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power--and independent power companies could supply as much as 1,200 megawatts from so-called peaker plants, facilities that generally are permitted to operate for only a few hundred hours a year because they pollute so heavily. That is enough power for more than 1 million homes. Other gas-fired power plants that have been shut down because of air pollution restrictions also could be started up as a result of the order. In a news conference Monday, state officials said the order will have the effect of lowering air pollution by limiting the use of far dirtier diesel generators, which industry could use if power supplies are threatened. ""If we don't get every last megawatt we can [from natural gas-fired plants],"" said Witherspoon of the air board, ""we will see people turning",alan.comnes@enron.com,"tom.alonso@enron.com, ray.alvarez@enron.com, robert.badeer@enron.com,

"Alan - thanks for assembling this information. It is very useful but I want to throw out some ideas for discussion and ask you and others to comment on the direction we take with this. I think we should characterize the Cost of Takeover as the difference in cost between the Nationalization approach Davis is taking and Enron's Market approach (increase supply, decrease demand, retail competition, utility solvency). Here's the direction that takes us: $13 B utility under-recovery: required in both cases. $7.6 purchase of Transmission: represents a $3.8B excess cost in Davis plan. Ratepayers were going to pay for the first $3.8B anyway. If Davis nets this against the $13 B under-recovery, then it's not an excess cost. Transmission upgrades: required in both cases. DSM/DG grants: required in both cases. New construction to cover short position: required in both cases. Cost difference is net difference between private market cost of generation and what subsidy CA must provide to induce generation at its desired cost, and net inefficiency from administering a govt. bureaucracy vs. free market entry and exit. These will be a function of how 6X is administered. In other words, I see the direct and measurable Cost of Takeover now as maybe $4-5 B, including $1B to cover court challenges, legal costs, new bureaucracy and so on. Much more important (and perhaps this is where the big $$ can come in) is through indirect costs - damage to California's economy through reduced private investment because of heavy-handed govt threat, loss of commercial",harry.kingerski@enron.com,alan.comnes@enron.com,"'Alan' : 'person', 'Davis' : 'person', 'Davis' : 'person', 'Davis' : 'person'",4,Re: Cost of Takeover,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,received,alan.comnes@enron.com

If you do it my way, price actually falls out of the equation and you estimate benefits simply by measuring flow times incremental production costs on both sides of the interface.

"It seems to me that this information leads one to conclude that the value of an open transmission network is that California does not have to build 5,000 MW of power plant (4,500 MW max input + 10%) in state. In other words, if California were to disconnect from the grid, someone would have to build additional power plants in-state. The cost to California consumers is therefore the annual carrying cost of 10 500 MW plants (made even more expensive after California expropriates the current fleet of merchant generation). From the perspective of the remainder of the West, the question still remains - if California does go it alone, what is the economic impact? Other than legal arguments about Interstate Commerce, why should the Federal Government want to continue to pursue open acess? This is the hard question that we need to answer.

"I attended a luncheon this afternoon at which the keynote speaker was FERC Chairman Curt Hebert. Although the Chairman began his presentation by expressly stating that he would not comment or answer questions on pending proceedings before the Commission, Hebert had some enlightening comments which relate to the referenced matter: Price caps are almost never the right answer Price Caps will have the effect of prolonging shortages Competitive choices for consumers is the right answer Any solution, however short term, that does not increase supply or reduce demand, is not acceptable Eight out of eleven western Governors oppose price caps, in that they would export California's problems to the West This is the latest intelligence we have been able to gather on the matter. We will be monitoring the Commission meeting tomorrow morning to determine the outcome.

"Here are my comments 1. I wouldn't agree the caps have hurt liquidity. In fact, in the Northwe= st at least, they have actually increased liquidity. Any decrease in liqui= dity can be attributed primarily to a couple of things (1) uncertainty abou= t the level of the cap and (2) when the day-ahead prices trade above the ca= p (removing marketers as sellers). I would propose the following cap timelines. First of all, I think it's im= portant that FERC realize the ""spot"" market really is two separate markets,= what we call the ""day-ahead"" cash markets, and ""day-of"" real-time markets.= The 24-hour designation doesn't dovetail with the current market timeline= s and is a source of confusion that can adversely affect liquidity and disp= atch of power plants. For example, day-ahead cash typically trades from 6:= 00 am to approximately 7:00 am for next day deliveries. However, on Thursd= ays the WSCC OTC market trades for Friday and Saturday deliveries, and on F= ridays, we trade for Sunday and Monday (all of this can be adjusted for var= ious reasons, but this is the typical schedule). If we held to the 24-hour= spot cap literally, then Tuesday thru Friday the cap would apply to the da= y-ahead market, but would not apply to Saturday and Monday. This obviously= cannot be an intended consequence.

"Except that my understanding of the SCE model is that the CTC structure will continue beyond 3/31/02 (and may then apply for PG&E). I agree that if you were to go to a bottom's up, it would require the CPUC to put in place a surcharge for remaining stranded costs (non-generation, for example QFs) and a second surcharge for Negative CTC ""overpayment"". Key question is who will pay the Negative CTC ""overpayment""? On trying to understand the PX Credit algorithim, my concern is that to understand how much the ""overpayment"" was during Oct - Feb, we need to understand how costs hit the structure during that time period. Otherwise we don't know what form or amount of discount is required in the Settlement talks.

Subject: RE: PG&E PX Credit Calculation -- CONFIDENTIAL ATTY CLIENT WORK PRODUCT After 3/31/02, the CTC should no longer be a function of the PX credit, no? So a customer's CTC payments should not be affected by refunds. If refunds are distributed prospectively, we do not need to really know the PX credt algorithm and can instead simply estimate PG&E's expected refunds, divide it by total load, and assume that the PX credit will be depressed by that amount.
