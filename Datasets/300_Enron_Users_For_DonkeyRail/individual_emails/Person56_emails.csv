I believe we should have the right to sink just as the load control areas do. This is an absolute must to level the playing field. They have a huge advantage on any thing going to implementation. We may need to go back to FERC or even the courts and,in my opinion we should not do any thing to weaken this stance. If we get something better than ENTERGY take it but do not support it. Let everyone know that we expect to be treated like any other player including the affiliates, Control Areas, and anyone else in the market place. This is not the time to support a position that allows for discrimination. You may want to discuss this in house.

"Kevin - Any word on how this might affect things? The following excerpt was from an article I read: One main concern of the creditors continues to be the information contained in Enron's book of business. They argue that the UBS deal, as structured, would relieve Enron's traders from their confidentiality agreements regarding information about trading positions. ""Knowing the content of the book would be very detrimental to the value of the book,"" said David Derosa, an expert witness for the creditors. He added: ""Paired with UBS' credit rating it will create a perfect predatory trading machine.""

"Kevin, I spoke with the lawyer representing Entergy, and he indicated that their intention is to provide redacted bid information to the PUC under a protective order. Excluded from their submittal will be any identifying information about each of the bidders. Their lawyer said that Enron's bid sheet (without identifying info) and contract comments (with no identifying info) would be submitted. Obviously, pricing info will be included. In order to acquire the filed information, someone must qualify as a ""Party"" and must agree to be bound by the terms of the protective order. Heather tells me Christi Nicolay was looking into the definition of ""Party"". I do not know if our competitors could qualify as Parties, but if they do, then common sense tells me that we should, too. At this point we should assume that they will get the redacted information. Seems like Entergy is doing what they can to protect the info, and our only choice I can think of would be to withdraw our bid. Heather tells me we want to go forward.

"Kevin: As I mentioned in a voice mail a couple of weeks ago, Reliant has expressed some concerns about the current EnronOnline notification process for changes to power products. My initial response after discussions with EnronOnline was to explain to Reliant that EnronOnline cannot change the notification process from them and to suggest alternative internal measures that Reliant can implement to monitor product changes. (According to EnronOnline, no other objections to the notification process have been received by EOL.) I had heard nothing else for a couple of weeks, and to date Reliant's use of EOL apparently has not been affected. However, one of Reliant's attorneys, Dede Russo, called me yesterday to discuss the issue again. I spoke with Rogers Herndon yesterday about Reliant's concerns, and Rogers perceives a real risk that Reliant will discontinue its use of EOL if we do not respond to their concerns. I would like to discuss this issue with you briefly and suggest that we may want to meet with Savita Puthgai of EnronOnline to consider how best to respond to Reliant.

Our product is currently being used and/or tested at over a dozen top power trading firms in the US, and the response has been fantastic. There are other methods of receiving this information currently, but none of them are as fast and as accurate as the Genscape data, as we have set up proprietary monitors outside of the right of way on over 130 coal and nuke plants (primarily) nationwide and involuntarily capture their output data every minute or so, thus we can alert traders to plant outages or plants coming on or off line in real time.

For the first few weeks ( to a few months) we continue to use Infinity to update the curves at 2 PM. I will need to have one trader to execute, mark curves and do any deals for foreign exchange (Cd$ etc.). Louise, I hope you have this in your budget and headcount. I will need one junior trader(and maybe two as things grow) to help do this job. I have lined up one of the guys in the old trading desk, if this goes forward. 2. In the first few weeks, Jay Webb and myself are hoping to acquire a lighter, and much simpler interest rate package which will allow us to do what we do, with significantly lower costs. We also will re-design the way we aggregate interest rate risk in the commodity books, to make it simpler and easier. To ensure there is no more discussion ever of drift-reallocation, I propose a method where, every desk head gets back his complete interest rate portfolio drift every month or quarter (less any transaction expenses ).

"Kevin: Rob Benson called me this morning to ask about the process for Permanent Residency (Green Card). At this time, I have been asked to hold on all new Green Card applications until further notice. However, we might want to amend Rob's visa status from L1B to L1A, making it easier, faster and cheaper to process the Green Card, hopefully in the near future. Rob was originally brought into the US in the capacity of Associate and this is why we used the L1B visa and not the L1A at that time. Now that he is a Director, we should be able to amend his visa to L1A. (The L1A is usually for Managers or above, or someone managing a function). Do I have your authority to go ahead with the amendment? The approximate cost is $1,000.

"WSJ(1/14)Heard On The Street:Enron Ex-CEO Made Bet Vs. Rival 01/13/2002 Dow Jones News Services (Copyright ? 2002 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) By Ken Brown Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal When Jeffrey Skilling resigned as chief executive of Enron Corp. in mid-August, he said he wanted to spend more time with his three children. ""I've missed too many soccer games over the years,"" he told his brother Tom soon after he quit. But instead of standing on the sidelines, Mr. Skilling stayed in the game, making a big, speculative stock-market bet against an Enron rival. A spokeswoman for Mr. Skilling confirms that he made the wager: a short sale initiated on Aug. 24 against shares of AES Corp., a big energy producer. A person familiar with the matter puts the trade's value at $30 million, though Mr. Skilling's spokeswoman says the estimate is ""way out of the ballpark"" on the high side. The bet came as AES's shares were tumbling, and, depending on when it was closed out, could have netted him a profit of more than $15 million. Mr. Skilling's spokeswoman, Judy Leone, confirms he did make a profit on the trade but won't say how much or when the trade was closed out. ""There is a category of personal financial information that we're going to respect Mr. Skilling's privacy on,"" Ms. Leone says.

Rika -----Original Message----- From: Dan Salter [mailto:dsalter@hgp-inc.com] Sent: Monday, October 29, 2001 8:45 AM To: Imai, Rika Subject: meeting Rika, For months we had no meetings, now all of a sudden I'm bringing one up almost every week. This meeting Fred said would be very beneficial to attend. It occurs Nov 1&2, 2001. It concerns nuclear industry consolidation and deregulation issues. It is covering a full range of important issues in our forecasting analysis including licensing, inspection, enforcement & assessment, decommissioning, deregulation, etc. Again, I brought this up to Fred to see if he agreed on the import of this meeting, and he strongly suggested we attend. Let me know as soon as possible because it is scheduled for this week.

"Kevin, Please, take a look at the link to the website describing the Neptune project (a merchant transmission DC line from Canada and Maine to NE). The link is embedded in one of the messages below. The Neptune Regional Electrical Transmission System will connect rapidly growing, electric-load centers in New York City, downtown Boston, and the Connecticut and New Jersey shores with clean and efficient electric generating facilities in Eastern Canada and Maine. Employing state of the art, environmentally proven sub-sea cable technology, the Neptune System will overcome constraints to the existing land-based electric transmission grid which hinder the efficient use of energy resources along the Mid and North Atlantic seaboard. Any interest?

"Kevin - Just an FYI - Steve Marland resigned from Reliant very recently. Steve had been trading their term Midwest book and has previously covered the SE I believe. I think Steve is a good trader, played the regional/time spreads very effectively, and is not afraid to put size on when appropriate. I just think that Reliant's management team is ""old school"" and Steve was not being able to effectuate the changes he saw necessary (apparently, they would not even let him trade NG against his positions). Steve just wanted to clear his head and get away. He is looking at the opportunities everyone else is at the moment and is not in a rush. I know he wants to work with a bright group that thinks the way he does. I have told him that he should talk to you guys. You may want to contact him directly when you have the green light to look outside ENE. I have known Steve for awhile and think he could be a good fit - I think Fletch has met him and dealt with him in the markets as well. Steve's cell number is 713-962-0274. I know he would like to talk to UBS.
