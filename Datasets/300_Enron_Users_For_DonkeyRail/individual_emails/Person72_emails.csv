Without seeing the spreadsheet that outlines your numbers, I think the issue is in how Enron Europe distributes the allocation the business unit received from Corp. I recall that last year (for 2001) the issue boiled down to how Europe handled the EH&S costs, which are separate from Gov't Affairs - but I don't have a record of what resolution was reached.

"I think part of the issue is how the allocations are classified within the Europe analysis spreadsheet. Asset Ops EHS and Reg Tech Analysis are classified as Asset Management, which doesn't seem to be an issue. However, Chief Environmental Officer is classified by Europe as Public Relations, and Environment and Environmental Policy and Compliance are classified as Gov't Affairs. We need to address whether these need to be consolidated as a separate category of EHS to include all of these cost center allocations. This is the first time I've seen this spreadsheet, but I'm happy to work with Stephen to work out how to better reflect the categorization - this year if possible, and definately for next year. This may be more at a policy level, however, so we may need further involvement of the budget owners. ----- Forwarded by Elizabeth Linnell/NA/Enron on 05/18/2001 08:52 AM ----- Steven J Kean 05/17/2001 11:31 AM To: Elizabeth Linnell/NA/Enron@Enron cc: Richard Shapiro/NA/Enron@Enron Subject: Re: Corporate Allocations April 2001 Is this a 2001 question?

"Jeff - As a follow-up to Steve's memo attached below are two Excel files outlining the remaining Public Affairs organization. We'll deliver a hard copy of these files, the memo, and the security agreement to your office as well. - The first file is a month by month summary of the budget and headcount totals, and illustrate the wind-down of several of the departments. This file does not include Bill Donovan's groups. - The second is an overview of all functions that reported to Steve, including Donovan's group. The first worksheet shows a comparison of the current budgets as submitted, and compares it to last year's (2001) and to earlier versions of next year's (2002). The backup worksheets contain organizational charts for each of the groups illustrating the headcount reductions that have taken place and those that are scheduled in the future.

I do not have the relevant slide here with me in Tokyo, but could work with Elizabeth on Friday, changing my earlier materials. In the prior materials, we showed this a big ""defensive"" issue (risk to be mitigated). I (very) conservatively put the value to Enron at $5MM for 2001 (Joe Gold says it saves him several hundred thousand this Q4 alone, and that number is low because he realigned his supply portfolio in anticipation of the charge being effective Oct. 1, which realignment he says he has not done/did not do yet for 2001, hence the bigger figure.

"Steve - Here's the latest draft of the presentation for your review. I have not yet made the changes I mentioned in the voicemail, and will wait for your direction. I also have not yet changed the last slide with the HR trends graph. I'll be in the office on Sunday to triple check the numbers and to compile a background packet for reference, so if you have anything you'd like clarified or changed please leave me a message or send a note. One item of note - Rick has shaved an additional $1.2M off his budget, so that definitely makes the Gov't & Reg Affairs number look better. I'm also forwarding this draft file to Dawn Derr, as Rick Causey wants to take a copy of the complete notebook home this weekend to review.

I do not have the relevant slide here with me in Tokyo, but could work with Elizabeth on Friday, changing my earlier materials. In the prior materials, we showed this a big ""defensive"" issue (risk to be mitigated). I (very) conservatively put the value to Enron at $5MM for 2001 (Joe Gold says it saves him several hundred thousand this Q4 alone, and that number is low because he realigned his supply portfolio in anticipation of the charge being effective Oct. 1, which realignment he says he has not done/did not do yet for 2001, hence the bigger figure.

"Greg - Mark is correct that Terry no longer controls these budgets, this is a carry-over from last year that we'll need to get corrected.

Mike is out of the office this week, but I'll follow up with his direct reports to get a description of the allocation for each of their cost centers.

I HAVE GEARED MY SUGGESTIONS TO THINGS THE FEDS CAN OR SHOULD DO.: THE PREAMBLE: The continuing lack of leadership by the Governor is causing serious concern for anyone looking for a stable environment in which to make the $billions in investments required for new power plants. The desparate search for blame placing (of exactly the guys that would make the investment), the lawsuits, the simplistic, outright misrepresentations of what happened and is happening, the threats of condemnation, etc. are doing a good job of making the public very uneasy and effectively destroying the ""market"" that resulted in the largest initiation of investment in power plants in the state's history. To the point, the debt lenders are getting nervous; the equity providors are getting nervous. (Duke: ""I would have less third world risk developing a plant in Brazil..."") If the final result of all of this is a public power agency that basically controls the grid and the buying and selling of power, the cynic might observe that we will have traded the accusations of greed of the present environment for a reversion to the old environment of inefficiency and escalating rate bases.

"Elizabeth - Regulatory Risk Analytics (Cost Center 103246) is to be rolled up to Rick Shapiro. If possible the cost center will be collapsed and the budget rolled to Cost Center 100108 and 103885.

Unattractive Features -- Majority of transmission rights allocated to existing users for a ten year period (""use or lose"" will mitigate for short term rights but long term rights on existing system will be tough to get). Desert STAR. Area to be included -- AZ, NM, CO, Eastern WY Governance established and Board has been organized. Have not yet filed a complete plan Earliest practical operation Winter 2002 or beyond, depending on when they actually file their proposal Plan quality -- Potentially promising Attractive Features -- similar transmission right regime as RTO West Unknown -- whether they will have a single control area, whether Unattractive Features -- Majority of transmission rights allocated to existing users, board selection committee was manipulated by publics (however in practice the independent board selected seems to have been little affected by the search firm nomination process",steve.walton@enron.com,elizabeth.linnell@enron.com,'Elizabeth' : 'person',1,"Re: Urgent - Steve Kean to testify at Senate hearing, need info",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,received,elizabeth.linnell@enron.com

The RED Index, which is the only known tool that objectively ranks states by 22 attributes on how they are restructuring their power markets, today released the U.S. rankings for all 50 states and the District of Columbia, in a 187 page report.

"I have little that Steve does not probably know by heart. But a few comments to Steve's point on siting new power plants. I ASSUME ""SENATE ENERGY COMMITTEE"" IS THE FEDERAL SENATE, NOT THE STATE SENATE. I HAVE GEARED MY SUGGESTIONS TO THINGS THE FEDS CAN OR SHOULD DO.: THE PREAMBLE: The continuing lack of leadership by the Governor is causing serious concern for anyone looking for a stable environment in which to make the $billions in investments required for new power plants. The desparate search for blame placing (of exactly the guys that would make the investment), the lawsuits, the simplistic, outright misrepresentations of what happened and is happening, the threats of condemnation, etc. are doing a good job of making the public very uneasy and effectively destroying the ""market"" that resulted in the largest initiation of investment in power plants in the state's history. To the point, the debt lenders are getting nervous; the equity providors are getting nervous. (Duke: ""I would have less third world risk developing a plant in Brazil..."") If the final result of all of this is a public power agency that basically controls the grid and the buying and selling of power, the cynic might observe that we will have traded the accusations of greed of the present environment for a reversion to the old environment of inefficiency and escalating rate bases. In my opinion, there is no way that the governor's present political",david.parquet@enron.com,elizabeth.linnell@enron.com,"'Steve' : 'person', 'Steve' : 'person', 'Governor' : 'person', 'Duke' : 'person', 'governor' : 'person'",5,"Re: Urgent - Steve Kean to testify at Senate hearing, need info",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,received,elizabeth.linnell@enron.com
