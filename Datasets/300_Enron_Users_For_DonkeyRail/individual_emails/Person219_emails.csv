"paperlooop.com BRUSSELS, July 31, 2001 (paperloop.com) - Sappi has taken massive downtime measures over the past three months to battle adverse trading conditions in the coated fine paper market. ""Coated fine paper is probably the worst market you can be at in 2001,"" the company's executive chairman, Eugene van As, said. ""We have taken severe production curtailments in this quarter. The market has been extremely difficult and the paper industry generally, I think, has taken a lot of curtailments,"" he added. Sappi took 150,000 tonnes of coated fine paper out of the European market during the third quarter, which equals one week a month, in a bid to match output to market requirements. The group's worldwide total downtime tonnage for the period reached almost 250,000 tonnes of coated fine paper. Sappi will continue to cut capacity in the fourth quarter but the total tonnage might not be as high as in the third quarter. There has been a clear reduction in paper consumption and advertising levels have dropped, but the company expects an upturn in consumption and demand, which would in turn mean less downtime, van As explained. The market has been hit by declining advertising revenues and huge new capacity that has come on line both in Europe and Asia. He singled out Asian Pulp & Paper (APP) as one culprit for disruptions in the Asian coated fine paper market. APP has built over a million tonnes of new capacity in the last two years, and ""they are",monika.causholli@enron.com,"teresa.aguilera-peon@enron.com, david.allan@enron.com,

"SAO PAULO, Brazil, Oct 15, 2001 (Reuters) - Brazilian paper and pulp maker Industrias Klabin Papel e Celulose SA said on Monday it would restructure its units in a cost-cutting drive it hopes will save 60 million reais ($22 million) per year. Klabin, one of Brazil's top producers of paper, tissue and wood pulp, will incorporate its Klamasa, KIV, Industrias Klabin and Igaras units under its subsidiary Klabin Riocell SA , the company said in a statement. Riocell will remain the sole publicly held company in the group and will be renamed Klabin SA. Minority shareholders in Klabin will be given shares in Riocell at par, Klabin's Director General Josemar Verillo told Reuters. The restructuring, to be completed by December, should reduce administrative, operational, financial and tax costs. It will also improve operating synergies, allow for a better use of financial resources and improve the group's transparency for investors, Klabin said. ""We have a lot of business between the group. That leads to operational and financial inefficiencies,"" Verillo said. The company said it expects to save about 60 million reais ($22 million) per year and could trim staff in the long term as a result of the restructuring. In a separate statement responding to an inquiry by the Sao Paulo Stock Exchange, Klabin said its consolidated net revenues would be 10 percent higher in 2001, driven by exports and a depreciation of Brazil's currency.

"BRUSSELS, Aug. 30, 2001 (paperloop.com) - The pressure of producing market pulp below cost is likely to provide its own outlet, according to a number of sources. Suppliers from North America's West Coast have been producing in the red for some time now and severe downtime will be forced upon them, providing the sharp slimming of inventories which is required for recovery. One supplier predicted, ""It won't be long before we get better prices and conditions."" Suppliers in the southern states of the US and eucalyptus producers are suffering similarly unprofitable business. Southern pine is a rarity now in Europe, as the home market proves more attractive. And some South American eucalyptus producers have turned the supply tap off in Italy. But Italian activity has proved a reliable barometer for market direction in the past and it is the Italian buyers who are seeking fixed contracts for two to three months in advance now. This is reported to be spreading north. There are rumblings in South America about a correction to the eucalyptus price. The weakened dollar means that Latin American eucalyptus priced in dollars is cheap compared with European volumes priced in euros. While producers are likely to wait at least until October for the market to see some post-vacation period momentum in the paper market, the intention is clear. Major producers of northern bleached softwood kraft have indicated they intend to go no lower than $450/tonne, yet the possibility of $440/tonne in September was not dismissed by buyers or sellers",monika.causholli@enron.com,"teresa.aguilera-peon@enron.com, david.allan@enron.com,

"SAN FRANCISCO, Sept. 27, 2001 (paperloop.com) - Worldwide chemical paper-grade market pulp producer inventories declined 66,000 tonnes in August from the prior month, according to preliminary data from the Pulp and Paper Products Council in Montreal. August marked the sixth month in a row that world inventories had fallen as producers dropped their stocks 1.9 percent from opening levels. World producer stocks closed August at 3.402 million tonnes, representing 37 days of supply, a day less than July results. Producer inventory levels are 33.3 percent higher than year-ago figures, when world producers held 28 days of supply. Although stocks are still high on a year-over-year basis, recent results still represented a strong improvement. Back in June, world producer stocks were 74.8 percent higher than the same period last year.

In order to understand the index system, the first thing is to look at our web-site www.foex.fi which includes a lot of information, particularly in this case the FAQ section. You probably have taken a look at that already, though. Our two pulp indexes, NBSKP (Northern Bleached Softwood Kraft) and BHKP (birch+eucalyptus) cover the European market. As abt 40% of the world pulp trade is for the European market, these are, in a way, considered to be the ""world market prices"", particularly as the third biggest market, North America (Asia is the second biggest) has virtually the same prices as Europe; correlation between the two is well over 0.9. The sellers reporting to us are, by definition, in NBSKP from Canada, US West Coast and the Nordic countries. BHKP (birch, euca) sellers are from the Nordic region, Latin America, Spain and Portugal and a number of Asian/African companies selling Eucalyptus pulp to the European market.

"paperloop.com BRUSSELS, Aug. 10, 2001 (paperloop.com) - Europe is no longer the happy hunting ground it was for spot deal makers. With a weak Euro and rock bottom prices for regular business, there is little room for undercutting without sinking below production costs. North American suppliers of spot hardwood tonnes have gradually disappeared from the European scene since the beginning of July. Their home market is a more lucrative place in present conditions. Canadian producers are already selling pulp at below full costs of production and suppliers from other parts of the world are coming up against the same predicament. Eucalyptus, as one buyer in Germany put it, ""doesn't really exist on the spot market any more."" There is still some softwood around for those who seek spot tonnage. But the downtime which pulp mills have been forced to take, allied to the fact that there is precious little difference between the spot deals and the price for regular business, means buyers are more likely to be pestered by their regular suppliers to take their normal quota than by hawkers of spot tonnes out to do a deal. What little Canadian NBSK that is available on the European spot market is priced at around $400/tonne. This is rather more than the Scandinavian equivalent, which has arrived on the market thanks to the over-production which June's Norscan figures revealed. Much of this pulp, which is available at some $20-30/tonne cheaper than Canadian NBSK, has found its way to Asia and the Middle East to compete for Government tenders.

"BRUSSELS, Aug. 23, 2001 (paperloop.com) - In a quiet market due to the mid-year vacation period, there have been reports that buyers have sought to settle pulp prices for the next three months. This suggests that the threat of a price rise in the near future is being taken seriously, or at least that prices are believed to have fallen as low as possible. The fear of buying pulp today on the basis that it might be cheaper tomorrow seems to have all but disappeared. Virtually unchanged Norscan inventories for July were greeted with enthusiasm in many quarters. The average rise in July is 147,000 tonnes and this year, the increase was a mere 5,000 tonnes to 1.785 million tonnes, based on an operating rate of 84.6%. The doom merchants who did not believe the industry capable of controlling stocks have been proved wrong, according to some sources who believe all that is needed now is a good Norscan result for August, and the market will be ready for a price rise in the fourth quarter. The widespread attitude to such optimism was succinctly summarized by one supplier who said, ""One should never talk down somebody who's talking up the market,"" which is, of course, very different from agreeing with the viewpoint. Firm signs of a recovery are absent as yet, and as one supplier put it, ""There is still a lot less paper being used than we would like.""

One major hold-out was Weyerhaeuser. At the time, we were skeptical of the success of a px increase for Oct. based on current market conditions -- favoring a gradual, modest increase in Nov and Dec. * This afternoon, WY announced that it was raising pulp pxs by $20 per tonne in the U.S. to $500 from $480/tonne (effective November 1). This move would effectively put WY's pricing in-line with the higher October levels attempted by other producers (which have not generally held, to our understanding). * Consistent with our view, we do believe that global market pulp pxs can rise modestly in November & December based on the fact that several regions' producers are seeing realizations near-or-below cash-cost levels. * We maintain our view that global market pulp pxs will rise gradually (at a modest pace) throughout 2002",ayesha.kanji@enron.com,monika.causholli@enron.com,"'Chip Dillon' : 'person', 'Salomon Smith Barney' : 'person', '1-212-816-2793' : 'phone number', 'c.a.dillon@ssmb.com' : 'email'",4,FW: Market Pulp -- Weyerhaeuser Announces U.S. Pulp Price Increase,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,received,monika.causholli@enron.com
