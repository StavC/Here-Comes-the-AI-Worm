Bob is expecting the demand to increase in 2002 for that area and generation will move along with it. His thinking is that prices will drop. The further you go out in time, he doesn't expect generation to keep as the demand continues to grow and so he is forecasting an increase in prices from around late 2005 out. FYI, there are more changes coming to the reports. Tim was in Houston last week and John said he thinks the reports could be changed or improved. Tim wants to see certain changes and get rid of some reports that John had told you he wanted to see when we made the changes about a month ago. I told Tim that I am not doing anything until he talks to John about it and they both agree. I hate to say it but it is becoming somewhat comical these reports.

Any updates that can be made in order for settlements to get the most accurate data would be most appreciated.

The historical greeks and curve shift are correct. They add up to -62084 The daily liquidation value [196872] is not correct, and is pushing the 2nd order to a very high (highly negative) amount. Upon examining the option liquidation report, we find that there is $43680 in liquidation and $153192 in expiring options. This totals to $196872. The issue is, the expiring options are no longer part of the option's effective date value, and they were part of the previous date's value (since they hadn't expired yet). Therefore, the liquidation values should be: Liq: $43680 Expired: -$153198 which totals to a negative value of -109512.
