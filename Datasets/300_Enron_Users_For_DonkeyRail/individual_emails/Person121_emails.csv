"MEDIA CONTACT: Terrie Prosper October 2, 2001 CPUC: 118 415-703-1366 tdp@cpuc.ca.gov PUC AND EDISON SETTLE FEDERAL LITIGATION TO MAINTAIN UTILITY SERVICE WITHOUT RAISING RATES The California Public Utilities Commission (PUC) and Southern California Edison (Edison) today reached a settlement in the Filed Rate Doctrine lawsuit Edison filed in federal court against the PUC. The settlement is intended to restore Edison to creditworthiness so that it is able to resume procuring the electricity needed by its customers; limit ratepayers' costs of paying off the debt; and maintain the state's role in regulating the investor owned utility by enabling Edison to pay down its back debts over a reasonable, certain period of time. The terms of the Settlement Agreement include: ? Edison will apply cash on hand, plus all of its revenue over recoverable costs, to paying off its back debt. The PUC and Edison have agreed that the amount of the back debt to be recovered from ratepayers is the amount of certain outstanding debt Edison had at August 31, 2001, less the cash on hand on that date, less an additional $300 million adjustment. The amount that will be paid down pursuant to the settlement agreement is estimated to be $3 billion as of the end of this month. The parties believe that the amount to be paid by ratepayers will be much less than the cap. ? Edison will not pay any dividends on its common stock through 2003",dhunter@s-k-w.com,jdasovic@enron.com,'Terrie Prosper' : 'person',1,"FW: PUC and Edison Settle Federal Litigation to Maintain Utility

"-----Original Message----- From: McEvoy, Bridget [mailto:Bridget.McEvoy@ElPaso.com] BN 18:06 Talks Between California, Generators End; No Accord (Correct) (Corrects lead to say judge recommended FERC hearings to result disagreements; adds comments from judge in fifth paragraph and comments from Enron in 13th paragraph.) Washington, July 9 (Bloomberg) -- A judge who oversaw two weeks of unsuccessful negotiations aimed at persuading power sellers to pay refunds in California and other western states recommended that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission hold hearings to resolve disagreements within 60 days. Two weeks of FERC-ordered talks ended today with the two sides no closer to an accord. ``In 15 days, you can't work miracles,'' said Curtis Wagner, FERC's chief administrative law judge. ``The numbers were too far apart.'' California says it is due a refund of $8.9 billion because the companies charged excessive prices. Other western states are also requesting money. A group of power sellers offered $510 million to California during the negotiations, scoffing at the state's method of calculating the refund, Wagner said. Other parties to the talks offered about $206 million, bringing the total offer from generators to $716 million. On Saturday, the state brought in analysts who explained how the state calculated its estimate.

"FYI. ORANGE COUNTY REGISTER EDITORIAL: DAVIS HURTING STATE In an editorial, the Orange County Register blasts Gov. Gray Davis and his board picks for the California PUC, which, the paper asserts, have nullified the only good to come out of California's energy deregulation - consumer choice. With commentary from Lance Izumi, an electricity policy analyst at the Pacific Research Institute, the Register says a PUC policy that requires customers to buy power from their local utility company is forcing ratepayers to fund Davis's overpriced energy purchases. The negative impact on California businesses, some already in a slump, could force the state's economy into a recession and discourage businesses from relocating there, the editorial said. It's reminiscent of the 1990's when government policy caused an economic bust and state unemployment shot to 10% (Orange County Register via Knight Ridder/Tribune News Service, Sept. 25, http://www.ocregister.com ).",jeff.dasovich@enron.com,dhunter@s-k-w.com,"'Gov.

"Calif. power bond delay may lead to large deficit NEW YORK, Sept 27 (Reuters) - California state Treasurer Philip Angelides said Thursday the state could face a $9.3 billion budget deficit in the 2002-2003 fiscal year if $12.5 billion of power bonds are not sold before July 2002. The treasurer is certain the bonds will be sold, but he released the figures in an attempt to pressure the California Public Utilities Commission (PUC) into actions it must take in order to sell the bonds. ""What I am concerned about is the fact this law has not been effectuated eight months after it was passed,"" Angelides said in a telephone news conference in Sacramento, referring to a law passed in February setting the biggest municipal bond sale ever in motion. The state depleted its general fund by at least $6.2 billion buying electricity to keep power flowing and must sell the bonds in order to refill the state's general fund and make future power purchases. ""There can be no schedule (for the bond sale) until the PUC completes its work,"" Angelides said. Earlier this week the PUC said the much-delayed meeting is now set for Oct. 2. Angelides said PUC Commissioner Jeff Brown, one of five, is on board to make the vote, but President Loretta Lynch and other commissioners, ""are not ready to act."" Lynch said earlier this week that she wants more time to work out details with Angelides and the Department of Water Resources concerning the money and terms of the rate order and rate agreement.

"I do not agree with Jeff's changes to Dorothy's language and I am not sure if Dorothy does. In particular, I don't know what is meant by the language in the definition of Spot Market Service which says ""and shall include all costs incurred by the electrical corporation to provide retail electric service"" which seems to me to go way beyond even energy service. I am also concerned that there be no way that customers have to pay for A/S twice. Second, I think 30 days is too short a time for a customer on Spot Market service to elect DA or Term Service, since if the UDC is providing Term Service on a best efforts basis, that option might not even be available within 30 days.
