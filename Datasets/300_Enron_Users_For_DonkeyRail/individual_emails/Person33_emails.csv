"Hi, guys. The House Commerce Committee currently has five Republican vacancies with two likely to go to Californians. Last week, Leadership determined that Freshman Members are ineligible for this assignment. Obviously it is important that these new California Members be supportive of Enron on electricity restructuring. Currently, Congresswoman Mary Bono and Congressman George Radanovich have expressed their interest in securing appointment to this Committee. We can certainly work with these Members, but are there other non-Freshman, California Republican Members who would be better? Many Members are unaware of how few Members are seeking these vacancies so a little education on our part could sway their interest. Please advise. Many thanks.

"Date: 12/13/00 4:47 PM 4:47 pm edt Energy chief moves to avert California blackouts Eds: LEADS to UPDATE with U.S. energy secretary ordering power generators to sell power to California. With BC-CA--Power Woes-Glance slasmt By STEVE LAWRENCE= Associated Press Writer= SACRAMENTO (AP) _ U.S. Energy Secretary Bill Richardson said Wednesday he would force power generators to sell electricity to California to prevent rolling blackouts. The announcement came as California power regulators warned of the likelihood of a Stage Three power alert with rotating blackouts Wednesday afternoon due to trouble buying electricity from the Northwest. About a dozen suppliers were demanding cash before selling power to California due to concerns about the utilities' solvency, said Kellan Fluckiger, chief operating officer of the Independent System Operator, keeper of the state's electrical grid. California's two largest utilities, Pacific Gas and Electric and Southern California Edison, are near bankruptcy due to skyrocketing wholesale power costs, Gov. Gray Davis and Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., said at a Washington, D.C., news conference with Richardson. Richardson said he was using emergency powers to force wholesalers to sell power to California at a price he deemed fair. He said he would also request that two large Pacific Northwest power generating associations generate more power to send to California. Davis and Feinstein also asked federal regulators to set a regional price cap on wholesale electricity to prevent the high prices that have plag",cynthia.sandherr@enron.com,"steven.kean@enron.com, richard.shapiro@enron.com, linda.robertson@enron.com,

"Linda: As discussed before, Senate Energy Committee staff have already begun meetings to draft the bipartisan Energy Legislation they plan to introduce at the beginning of the 107th Congress. Their bill will focus on three major categories including ""supply"" (including fuel diversity, and consistent natural gas prices regardless of world oil prices, etc.); ""infrastructure development"" (including pipeline construction for gas and liquids, eminent domain for electricity transmission, reliability including California plus heating oil reserves with concerns regarding the mandatory inventory levels precedence set by Massachusetts); and ""efficiency"" (including tax measures, renewables and distributed generation.) They are working off of the 106th Congress bills S. 2557, S. 2904 and tax bills such as S. 2718. In addition, they are meeting with RUS to discuss ideas to fund transmission builds in rural areas so as to eliminate capacity restraints. Further, CRS is writing an ""options"" paper addressing various means to stimulate supply. Finally, they are awaiting BLM's official ""inventory of the public lands available for development"" which shall include listings of constraints to development, thus, enabling them to draft solutions. They will likely do the tax issues first and then the access issues after but this is not set in stone. Regardless, now is the time for Enron to supply input and innovative solutions to address the issues.

"From: Cynthia Sandherr 01/11/2000 05:16 PM Rick: Per your request, please find the one page description of how the Washington D.C. office prioritizes both human and financial resources while fitting within the Enron budget process. I have attached our 1999 activities report which illustrates the process described below. Congress operates in a two year cycle while the Administration operates in a four or eight year cycle. Thus, it is necessary for our prioritization to focus on the long term. Within the context of the Congressional and Administration's Calendars, our office determines and communicates doable priorities based upon the environment in which we operate. In addition, we actively work behind the scenes and commit resources to affect and change this environment. On an annual basis, we communicate federal legislative and global opportunities which we believe affect our operations via briefings to Steve Kean, who along with our assistance, submits our proposed goals to the Enron Management Committee, Global CEO's , individual operating company heads and heads of key divisions. Many dialogues and briefings occur resulting in goal adjustments and additions. During this dialogue, we advise on possible new corporate strategies based upon political realities and communicate necessary resources required in order to achieve the legislative successes. Once this vetting process is complete (December-January timeframe), and the Management Committee prioritizes the federal Corporate goals, we submit our budget and assure this budget directly correlates to the necessary resources (both human and financial) detailed and allocated to meet these priorities.

"As discussed, should Congress upon its return after the Labor Day recess appear ready to move H.R. 4941, Congressman Wynn's stand-alone reliability legislation; a large group of stakeholders would sign and send the attached letter. Although Enron would like the letter to be stronger, this letter went through many revisions to reach the consensus language necessary for a larger group to sign. Thus, while not a perfect letter, it would send a stronger message with a multitude of signatures. The status of the letter is that it is being ""held in our back pocket"" should it become necessary. Pre-approval has been given and it stands in an ""almost"" final form. Should you have any grave problems with the letter, let me know, and I will see what's possible given the constraints posed by the group.

With BC-CA--Power Woes-Glance slasmt By STEVE LAWRENCE= Associated Press Writer= SACRAMENTO (AP) _ U.S. Energy Secretary Bill Richardson said Wednesday he would force power generators to sell electricity to California to prevent rolling blackouts. The announcement came as California power regulators warned of the likelihood of a Stage Three power alert with rotating blackouts Wednesday afternoon due to trouble buying electricity from the Northwest. About a dozen suppliers were demanding cash before selling power to California due to concerns about the utilities' solvency, said Kellan Fluckiger, chief operating officer of the Independent System Operator, keeper of the state's electrical grid. California's two largest utilities, Pacific Gas and Electric and Southern California Edison, are near bankruptcy due to skyrocketing wholesale power costs, Gov. Gray Davis and Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., said at a Washington, D.C., news conference with Richardson. Richardson said he was using emergency powers to force wholesalers to sell power to California at a price he deemed fair. He said he would also request that two large Pacific Northwest power generating associations generate more power to send to California. Davis and Feinstein also asked federal regulators to set a regional price cap on wholesale electricity to prevent the high prices that have plag",cynthia.sandherr@enron.com,"steven.kean@enron.com, richard.shapiro@enron.com, linda.robertson@enron.com,

"Rick: unfortunately, the stand alone reliability legislation DOES have a ""reasonable chance of passing."" To block this possibility, we are pursuing two strategies simultaneously. #1 the Stakeholder letter with the message that the bill does little for reliability and provides no real political inoculation so should not be passed; and #2 the lack of consensus on the technical language contained within the bill makes passage problematic. If the bill were to be able to move, the bill must be considered ""consensus"" otherwise it will pose political problems for the Calendar. Today, there is still lack of bill consensus. We should consider a strategy of asking for reasonable legislative provisions beyond the current language which would improve the bill (and continue to keep true consensus from occurring.) Of course, we cannot be obvious on this approach. Part of the reason I was pushing to get one or our CEO's to play golf with Congressman Tauzin on the 22nd is he is the key Member pushing the House Leadership to pass the stand-alone bill now to ""politically inoculate Republicans."" As the likely new House Commerce Committee Chairman; he carries sway. Another approach would be for us to call Entergy to give Congressman Tauzin the same message.

(3) if DOE should issue a rule and has the authority to do so, what should be included in the rule? The NOI will not contain any proposed language. The comment period will be 45 days, and Rich does not expect this Adminstration to act on this issue. In effect, he said, they are simply teeing the issue up for the next Administration.

"Linda: As discussed before, Senate Energy Committee staff have already begun meetings to draft the bipartisan Energy Legislation they plan to introduce at the beginning of the 107th Congress. Their bill will focus on three major categories including ""supply"" (including fuel diversity, and consistent natural gas prices regardless of world oil prices, etc.); ""infrastructure development"" (including pipeline construction for gas and liquids, eminent domain for electricity transmission, reliability including California plus heating oil reserves with concerns regarding the mandatory inventory levels precedence set by Massachusetts); and ""efficiency"" (including tax measures, renewables and distributed generation.) They are working off of the 106th Congress bills S. 2557, S. 2904 and tax bills such as S. 2718. In addition, they are meeting with RUS to discuss ideas to fund transmission builds in rural areas so as to eliminate capacity restraints. Further, CRS is writing an ""options"" paper addressing various means to stimulate supply. Finally, they are awaiting BLM's official ""inventory of the public lands available for development"" which shall include listings of constraints to development, thus, enabling them to draft solutions. They will likely do the tax issues first and then the access issues after but this is not set in stone.

"Steve: the ACE language has been modified somewhat from the original form which you have indeed seen before but not enough modification so as to correspond to FERC Order 2000. The question being put is what amendments would be necessary to the ACE language to satisfy Enron's needs given the reluctance of ACE to either accept 1.) generic language so the Order prevails, nor to accept 2.) exact specific language to detail precisely Order 2000. Are there items in 2000 we could give up in the legislative language? Otherwise, ACE believes due to their support from Commissioner Hubert and the general political weakness of FERC, that their existing language has the votes in Committee to in effect overturn portions of Order 2000. ACE's willingness to accept any changes to their language has resulted from our overall effective strategy. However, the question now is what precisely do we ask for and what is the order of importance of our requests? Many thanks.

With BC-CA--Power Woes-Glance slasmt By STEVE LAWRENCE= Associated Press Writer= SACRAMENTO (AP) _ U.S. Energy Secretary Bill Richardson said Wednesday he would force power generators to sell electricity to California to prevent rolling blackouts. The announcement came as California power regulators warned of the likelihood of a Stage Three power alert with rotating blackouts Wednesday afternoon due to trouble buying electricity from the Northwest. About a dozen suppliers were demanding cash before selling power to California due to concerns about the utilities' solvency, said Kellan Fluckiger, chief operating officer of the Independent System Operator, keeper of the state's electrical grid. California's two largest utilities, Pacific Gas and Electric and Southern California Edison, are near bankruptcy due to skyrocketing wholesale power costs, Gov. Gray Davis and Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., said at a Washington, D.C., news conference with Richardson. Richardson said he was using emergency powers to force wholesalers to sell power to California at a price he deemed fair. He said he would also request that two large Pacific Northwest power generating associations generate more power to send to California. Davis and Feinstein also asked federal regulators to set a regional price cap on wholesale electricity to prevent the high prices that have plag",cynthia.sandherr@enron.com,"steven.kean@enron.com, richard.shapiro@enron.com, linda.robertson@enron.com,

"Yesterday, Ken Lay spoke with MidAmerican CEO David Sokol regarding the attached new legislative amendment to provide a limited PUHCA exemption for companies with a high level of financial stability as determined by independent market analysts (i.e. ""A"" rating for Holding Companies or investment grade rating for utility companies). This is not a permanent exemption as PUHCA would again apply should the company loose its high rating. MidAmerican's lobbyist reported this conversation to me along with Ken Lay's reported commitment that we would review it as soon as we could. Reportedly, Ken Lay was non-committal but not negatively disposed. The utility strategy is to have Senator Bob Kerrey (D-NE) offer this as an amendment to a ""must pass"" piece of legislation during the waning days of this Congressional session. This will be separate from the utilities' strategy to enact Private Use legislation (H.R. 4971, S. 2967 which includes tax language to exclude water and sewage connection fees from gross income as contributions to capital and language to increase the amount permitted to paid into nuclear decommissioning reserve funds primarily for Commonwealth Edison) and to enact stand-alone Reliability legislation (S. 2071 and H.R. 2944).

"Joshua: I found the Enron staff who have had the conversations with the Oregon PUC so believe the attached Q&A meet your request. If you need additional materials, just let me know. In addition, EPSA sent some questions they would like the Senator to ask of any of the EPSA witnesses (Reliant, Calpine, Williams, or Enron) dealing with the Impact of the Recent changes in the Management of the California Independent System Operator: Background: The Cal ISO acts as the ""air traffic controller"" for the interstate electric power grid in California. The ISO determines who gets access to the grid and under what terms and conditions. It is the ISO that helps ensure that access to the grid is truly open and non-discriminatory. When the ISO was initially constituted several years ago, a ""stakeholder"" management board was created that represented a wide range of market interests---power sellers, generators, consumers, political leaders, etc. After the power emergencies began last summer, this board was criticized as too splintered and indecisive. In a response to this perception and in an effort to impose greater control over the ISO, the California state legislature replaced the stakeholder board with a five-person board that serves at the request of the California Governor. QUESTION: The Cal ISO has recently seen its management board changed from one with broad stakeholder representation to one appointed by the California Governor. Given that California is a critical part of a larger western regional power market, how can we ensure that regional power needs are reflected in the decisions of the new state",cynthia.sandherr@enron.com,joshua_sheinkman@wyden.senate.gov,"'Joshua' : 'person', 'Senator' : 'person', 'Reliant' : 'person', 'Calpine' : 'person', 'Williams' : 'person', 'California Governor' : 'person', 'California Governor' : 'person'",7,Questions you requested,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,sent,cynthia.sandherr@enron.com

Please let me know if we need to do anything further. thanks. ---------------------- Forwarded by Cynthia Sandherr/Corp/Enron on 09/14/2000 12:57 PM --------------------------- Clayton Seigle@ECT 09/14/2000 11:41 AM To: Cynthia Sandherr/Corp/Enron@ENRON cc: Joe Hillings/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Scott Tholan/Corp/Enron@Enron, Robert Johnston/HOU/ECT@ECT Subject: washington contacts Dear Cynthia: Just wanted to follow",steven.kean@enron.com,cynthia.sandherr@enron.com,"'Scott Tholan' : 'person', 'Cynthia Sandherr' : 'person', 'Steven J Kean' : 'person', 'Joe Hillings' : 'person', 'Richard Shapiro' : 'person', 'Chris Long' : 'person', 'Cynthia Sandherr' : 'person', 'Clayton Seigle' : 'person', 'Cynthia Sandherr' : 'person', 'Joe Hillings' : 'person', 'Scott Tholan' : 'person', 'Robert Johnston' : 'person'",12,Re: washington contacts,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,received,cynthia.sandherr@enron.com

"Cynthia: here is the comment I would forward to Senators Gramm and Schumer concerning their provision on ""Environmental Conditionality"". Sorry this was thrown together very quickly on short notice, but I hope it is helpful. Section 154: Environmental Conditionality In general, as this provision attempts to close the loophole for grandfathered (pre 1977) coal plants, there would be an negative impact on coal trading (particularly high-sulfur) and our equity positions in coal mines. However, there are opportunities to still profit by shorting/hedging our positions -- if we have enough knowledge and information about when these changes are going to take place, we will likely be able to seize opportunities from the resulting volatility. The question in your e-mail asked only about coal markets, but on the whole, Enron could find some benefits from this kind of provision because of our ability to trade more gas, transport more gas, and build merchant gas/combined cycle capacity, renewables, etc. I have not had the chance to get any analysis on electricity prices, but I would suspect that our view would be that there may be some volatility due to the shift in fuels but it would level out with the right risk management in the longer term -- I can try to get more for you as this legislation evolves. Specific comments on the drafting, section-by-section: (a) the only comment I would raise is that how the term ""electric generating unit (EGU)"" is defined is controversial right now.

"I believe it is timely to discuss this again and I agree with Cynthia that stand alone legislation does nothing to address the essential transmission structural issues. I am open minded on the issue if someone can make a compelling case to support stand alone legislation, BUT my gut reaction is that it would be a serious mistake. Congress would happily put off dealing with this issue for years if it passes reliability only legislation. I think the legislation itself makes little or no progress on our issues and may even set us back on making progress at FERC and in other fora. I realize that if this gets going it may be hard to stop, but it would be such a cynically ineffective approach to the real reliability problems that we should help whomever we can to put a stop to it. If it gets through committee, I have no confidence in this Congress to actually amend it into something better and broader, so, again, I have difficulty seeing why we should go that route.

"Cynthia: here is the comment I would forward to Senators Gramm and Schumer concerning their provision on ""Environmental Conditionality"". Sorry this was thrown together very quickly on short notice, but I hope it is helpful. Section 154: Environmental Conditionality In general, as this provision attempts to close the loophole for grandfathered (pre 1977) coal plants, there would be an negative impact on coal trading (particularly high-sulfur) and our equity positions in coal mines. However, there are opportunities to still profit by shorting/hedging our positions -- if we have enough knowledge and information about when these changes are going to take place, we will likely be able to seize opportunities from the resulting volatility. The question in your e-mail asked only about coal markets, but on the whole, Enron could find some benefits from this kind of provision because of our ability to trade more gas, transport more gas, and build merchant gas/combined cycle capacity, renewables, etc. I have not had the chance to get any analysis on electricity prices, but I would suspect that our view would be that there may be some volatility due to the shift in fuels but it would level out with the right risk management in the longer term -- I can try to get more for you as this legislation evolves.

The field hearings are not as high profile as a D.C. hearing. Further, we can wait to see who PG&E sends and others. Likely the California utilities will send their CEO's so if we need to be on the same panel with them we would need to send Jeff Skilling. But, tactically, we may not wish to do this? Otherwise, we can go for a technical person or for someone like Steve Kean......this will",steven.kean@enron.com,cynthia.sandherr@enron.com,"'Cynthia Sandherr' : 'person', 'Steven J Kean' : 'person', 'voicemail' : 'phone number', 'Jeff Skilling' : 'person', 'Cynthia Sandherr' : 'person', 'Cynthia Sandherr' : 'person', 'Mark Palmer' : 'person', 'Jeff Skilling' : 'person', 'Steve Kean' : 'person'",9,Re: Hearing,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,received,cynthia.sandherr@enron.com

"Cynthia: As you know, the Bankruptcy Code revisions never made it through the recent Congress. I understand they bogged down in the final days over issues which were essentially irrelevant to us in ECT. I'm not sure you are aware of the importance to our trading business of certain of the other proposed revisions. We anticipate that the revisions will be reintroduced in the next Congress and are beginning to think about ways that we can influence the outcome this time around. Are you the right person in your shop for us to talk to about this? If you could let me know, I'd appreciate it.

"I think this is a great initiative, but it is critically important that any announcement of the panel makes it crystal clear that the objective of the group is to come up with standards to facilitiate competition. We will do nothing but waste time if it becomes a negotiation over competition. the best and politically easiest time to make that objective clear is in the original announcement, not after the group gets underway. Can we get in touch with DOE to make sure they pick this up?

It is looking positive that he may be positioned to make the announcement Monday.
