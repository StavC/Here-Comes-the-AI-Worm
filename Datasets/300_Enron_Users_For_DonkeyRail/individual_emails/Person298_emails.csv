Points of interest on this small project This project is in Phase VI economics (yet to be formally reviewed and approved) Probably belongs in the economics. It will NOT be in the Phase VI filing That's to keep it out of the headlights. $3.5mm was approved by the Board, (but it alledgedly needs $4mm) We will have to approve the increase. Commercial will have to take care of getting in on the agenda and a resolution prepared. Its being functionalized as a ""commercial"" project I think it is, since it is to support a new FTS-2 commercial transportation contract Its going to be managed by ""operations"" Not sure what this means It will probably actually be built by ""construction and engineering"" I am assuming this is a non-profit transaction and is actually being done without a contract, otherwise the contract will require separate Board Approval. -----Original Message----- From: Keiser, John Sent: Tuesday, November 06, 2001 9:09 AM To: Saunders, James Cc: Loyd Jr., Talbert; Cernoch, Leon; Hsieh, Sally; Cobb Jr., John Subject: Cape Kennedy Loop We are going to give this a ""M"" Capital Budget Code since the cost for the Loop was included in the Phase 6 economics.",rod.hayslett@enron.com,james.saunders@enron.com,"'Saunders, James' : 'person', 'Hayslett, Rod' : 'person', 'Kilmer III, Robert' : 'person', 'Keiser, John' : 'person', 'Saunders, James' : 'person', 'Loyd Jr., Talbert' : 'person', 'Cernoch, Leon' : 'person', 'Hsieh, Sally' : 'person', 'Cobb Jr., John' : 'person'",9,RE: Cape Kennedy Loop,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,received,james.saunders@enron.com

"Jim: The footnote disclosure regarding the credit faciltiy mentions the Citibank prepay and the split between NNG and TPC. We will be trying to include the entire amount in the TPC facilty rather than split the amount. In addition, the facility will be unwound at the corp level and dropped into TPC, therefore, I am not sure we need to even mention this in the footnotes. -----Original Message----- From: Hayslett, Rod Sent: Tuesday, November 06, 2001 12:51 PM To: Howard, Kevin A.
