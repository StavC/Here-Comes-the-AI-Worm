"Kevin, Obviously I am not searching for any additional write-offs. It is clear to me that you have not come to terms with the problems we have already identified. We are only trying to make sure that we have accurately quantified those problems already identified. As I am sure you know, we estimate that there is no remaining value in the portfolio and more than likely material write-offs. Therefore, to make earnings we are going to have create positive incremental value. Trading will produce no positive incremental value in this quarter. On a go forward basis we have losses we must recognize to clean up the portfolio and move on. The Lightrade deal involved selling pooling points that could be considered somewhat central to our success as a bandwidth trading organization - we were willing to do this to help EBS make short term earnings. If we did not burn up in excess of $500 million this year, accomplishing virtually nothing, then we would not be in this position. You have never considered prudent write-offs, why start now.

"Barry sent me a copy of the draft memo announcing his role within EBS. Since Scott Pleus is currently in that role and does have people reporting to him in EBS that are in trading operations, I would suggest that the memo contain a mention of the transition: Example: Scott Pleus is currently Director of trading operations for EBS. He will be transitioning to an origination role within EBS in mid May as Barry Pearce assumes his responsibilities for EBS. The current trading staff for EBS will report to Barry effective with his start date in May. I also heard from Barry today that Todd Lindholm let him know that he is out of the picture with regard to commercial support for bandwidth trading operations and that Barry will report to John Echols.

"I have heard through several sources that AEP has purchased the Enron Nordic team in Oslo. This creates several issues that we must address: Did AEP purchase any systems and/or contracts? Are these employees still located in our office and if so are they assuming the building lease and associated expenses? Do they still have access to our systems? Who, if anyone, was not included in the AEP purchase? Many of the deals were executed under ECTRIC - Nordic Branch; is this treated similar to ECTRIC? Since ECTRIC still has not declared bankruptcy, we need to evaluate these portfolios immediately.

"Draft - for your review...not sure who to say to 'report to'......although obviously it's you. We are pleased to announce that Barry Pearce, Vice President, will be joining Enron Broadband Services as Global Controller of Trading Support Operations. Barry, who will be based in Houston and report functionally to both Jim Fallon and John Echols, will assume responsibility for the on-going day-to-day control and development of EBS's trading support infra-structure. Recognizing that EBS's increasing trading operations worldwide are ever expanding, there is a need to insure outstanding internal controls are in place for all trading and risk management activities, regardless of location. Barry's responsibilities with regard to Global Trading Support Operations will mirror those of other Controller functions throughout Enron. In this role, Barry will work closely with Sally Beck's Global Risk Management Group to insure that EBS is focused on best practice throughout the front and back office functions, including Risk Book Management, Deal Capture, Contract Administration, Contract Settlements and Trading Accounting. Barry's group will also help ensure operational systems are developed to facilitate the timely and accurate reporting of all trading activities and that key operational procedures and processes are implemented. Barry has been with Enron since 1992, when he joined the company from Arthur Andersen. Barry has spent the last five years in London playing an integral part in the development and success of the support operations of ECT Europe. He moves to EBS from his current job as VP, European Gas and Power Trading Support Operations.

"Draft - for your review...not sure who to say to 'report to'......although obviously it's you. We are pleased to announce that Barry Pearce, Vice President, will be joining Enron Broadband Services as Global Controller of Trading Support Operations. Barry, who will be based in Houston and report functionally to both Jim Fallon and John Echols, will assume responsibility for the on-going day-to-day control and development of EBS's trading support infra-structure. Recognizing that EBS's increasing trading operations worldwide are ever expanding, there is a need to insure outstanding internal controls are in place for all trading and risk management activities, regardless of location. Barry's responsibilities with regard to Global Trading Support Operations will mirror those of other Controller functions throughout Enron. In this role, Barry will work closely with Sally Beck's Global Risk Management Group to insure that EBS is focused on best practice throughout the front and back office functions, including Risk Book Management, Deal Capture, Contract Administration, Contract Settlements and Trading Accounting. Barry's group will also help ensure operational systems are developed to facilitate the timely and accurate reporting of all trading activities and that key operational procedures and processes are implemented. Barry has been with Enron since 1992, when he joined the company from Arthur Andersen. Barry has spent the last five years in London playing an integral part in the development and success of the support operations of ECT Europe.

"-----Original Message----- From: Phelan, Joseph Sent: Tuesday, November 20, 2001 10:58 AM To: Kean, Steven J. Cc: Olson, Cindy Subject: Severance Issues - a suggestion Steve, I have been told that the severance program is ""under review"". As you well know, many long term, dedicated Enron employees who have been with the company for nearly a decade have seen their entire net worth completely wiped out. Retirement plans, college funds, etc have all evaporated. Since the average tenure for an Enron employee is rather short, I believe that this subset is actually quite small. This small subset of employees has been wronged. I believe one way to cushion this blow is to alter the severance equation as follows: 4 weeks X (number of employment years) 1 week X (each 10,000 of salary) Example one: 2 year employee with an $80,000 salary = 2*4+80/10 = 16 weeks severance Example two: 10 year employee with a $100,000 salary = 10*4+100/10 = 50 weeks severance This will accomplish two tasks, one is to skew the severance towards the longer term employees, the other is to reduce the total outlay so as not to overburden the company (since the group receiving the higher severance is small). I believe this is fair to both the employees and to our soon-to-be new management. Pls consider running this by management and or some focus groups, if in fact, the package is under review.

"Draft - for your review...not sure who to say to 'report to'......although obviously it's you. We are pleased to announce that Barry Pearce, Vice President, will be joining Enron Broadband Services as Global Controller of Trading Support Operations. Barry, who will be based in Houston and report functionally to both Jim Fallon and John Echols, will assume responsibility for the on-going day-to-day control and development of EBS's trading support infra-structure. Recognizing that EBS's increasing trading operations worldwide are ever expanding, there is a need to insure outstanding internal controls are in place for all trading and risk management activities, regardless of location. Barry's responsibilities with regard to Global Trading Support Operations will mirror those of other Controller functions throughout Enron. In this role, Barry will work closely with Sally Beck's Global Risk Management Group to insure that EBS is focused on best practice throughout the front and back office functions, including Risk Book Management, Deal Capture, Contract Administration, Contract Settlements and Trading Accounting. Barry's group will also help ensure operational systems are developed to facilitate the timely and accurate reporting of all trading activities and that key operational procedures and processes are implemented. Barry has been with Enron since 1992, when he joined the company from Arthur Andersen. Barry has spent the last five years in London playing an integral part in the development and success of the support operations of ECT Europe. He moves to EBS from his current job as VP, European Gas and Power Trading Support Operations.
