"Tana, I'm hoping you can clarify some information I received second-hand on Cargill, Incorporated, and Cargill Energy, a division of Cargill, Incorporated. It is my understanding that Cargill Energy, a division of Cargill, Incorporated, is allowed to trade under the ISDA (contract 96043502) between Cargill, Incorporated and ENA. Based on the information in the Legal Financial Trading Agreement database, there is no information to indicate that this affiliate is also covered by the Cargill, Incorporated master . Also, the email from Susan Flynn does not include any information on additional parties covered under this contract. Finally, Part 4(b) of the schedule to the agreement specifies that for Section 10(c) of the contract , neither party is a multibranch party. This is all the information that Anthony Campos has received to date on this contract. Based on this information, and from previous requests from Legal for Global Contracts to refer any interpretations to Legal, the Global Contracts group could not make any assumptions regarding other counterparties not specifically listed on the contract or schedules. I wanted to verify if what I had heard about Cargill Energy, a division of Cargill, Incorporated, was correct and to obtain the pertinent documentation if so. Also, does Legal have any specific ""policies"" regarding affiliate relationships? Is there any documentation we should have been aware of?

The only active contract we have in place with Holcomb is an Enfolio II Spot and the interest assignment letter sent by Holcomb does not cover an agreement so broad. I spoke with Susan Herrera at Holcomb [(505) 326-0550] and asked her to send an assignment letter. She didn't seem to really understand what I needed to I also gave her Gerald's number in Legal. Once we receive a good assignment, I will request that the Global Counterparty group set up the CP. Sharon will process the assignment at that point.

Right now it's manageable and I don't want to have a bunch more templates to have to worry about. It's easy enough to remember to change those new GTCs we set up now, so we'll just play it by ear. If too many CPs request these changes that it makes it difficult for us to keep track of, then we'll set up new templates accordingly. Please give me a shout if you have any questions. Thanks!
