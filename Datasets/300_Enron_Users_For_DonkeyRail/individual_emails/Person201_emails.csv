"Tracy, Attached is a spreadsheet model which contains both Black-Scholes and American option valuation models. These are the generally accepted methods for valuation of options on equity. The ""European"" option prices assume that the option holder can exercise his options only at maturity, while the ""American"" style options can be exercised at any time during their life. I have assumed in the examples that the underlying equity units have a market value of $13.00 and that the options are struck at this level. The volatility input is the other main assumption. EOTT has been trading recently with a volatility ranging between 30% to 40% although looking further back, the range is much wider. To run the model, you must be linked with the options library. I am not sure what lan you are connected with, but you can coordinate with Zimin Lu (x36388) for help with loading the option library add-in module. On the ENA lan it is located under O:\research\exotica\xll\exotica.xll. This is loaded in excel using the Tools/Add-Ins and Browse to reach the add-in location. --Stinson x34748 P.S.

This type of analysis is critical to understanding what types of bottlenecks we might encounter in trying to service, for example, the Blockbuster deal. Martin has already come up to speed so that he is able to largely replace an expensive contractor from Lucent who is under contract to support this modelling effor.

"Jeff, In response to your request for a new option valuation model for P+, I have talked with Spencer about his needs for managing the options and have done some analysis of historical posting prices and their relationship to moves in the Nymex. Although you specifically mentioned building a Monte-Carlo type of model, this should probably be avoided if possible because of the substantial recalculation time which would burden both the trader and book administrator. We can accomplish the same goal by extending the current spread option model to the case where one of the legs of the spread is a basket of commodities. For P+, one leg of the spread is a combination of the Nymex Swap and the Posting Basis (which added, gives the Posting Price). The valuation function itself is ready, so all that remains is to incorporate this new function into a test version of the book so we can calculate the P&L impact. We will need to work with Spencer and Mark on this to be sure that we are using the correct inputs and positions. Based on some initial experiments, I don't think that this model will lead to a large change in the value of these options.

"Paul, Vince and I spent some time thinking about the diligence process for the trading analytics. There is a limited amount that can be accomplished in a two day time period. I think a reasonable start would be the following: 1. Obtain an audited history of the trading strategies which have been implemented in order to verify profitability, and P/L volatility of each. 2. Review needed working capital and risk capital requirements and compare these to projections for trading income. 3. Review current level of access to electronic markets and verify that a change of ownership would not have adverse consequences, i.e. are there guarantees of continued access using the current systems? 4. Review feasibility of entry into proposed new markets? It is far from clear that there will be any synergy with most commodity markets given the current limited ""electronic"" liquidity. 5. Review, at least qualitatively, the current trading strategies being used. Try to develop some estimate of how fast the profitability of these strategies will disappear as other's implement similar trading models. What is the trade off between trade quantity and slippage. 6. Review the methodology used to generate new trading strategies which will be needed to replace the current models as they become unprofitable and outdated. 7. Try to determine if there will be any value in transfer of trading technology to Enron's other markets, given the illiquidity of these markets as compared to the financial equity markets.

"Karla, The wording you have below sounds reasonable as we would only use the code for internal valuation purposes. I also checked with Vince regarding the issues we discussed by phone yesterday. He would like to specify a 2 day response time for the software support. Also, he would like to specify that the payment schedule be: 50% at time of initial contract and 50% at the time when the software is released. This would give them an incentive to release the software before the full year is over if they want to accelerate the payment.

There are still limitations as to what you can do with it, so I will need to know so we can try to revise the contract so that you will be legal. For example, in the language regarding release of the source code from escrow, it states that once you have the source code, you just have the ""right to use, copy and modify the Source Code, solely for our internal purposes in connection with support, maintenance and operation of the Software"". Do yall plan to reverse engineer, decompile, etc? Do you plan on using any of their code to create our own product? If so - I think these are going to be a problem.

"Find below a spreadsheet with my very rough calculation of the value of credit support for MG and PaperCo. My approach is as follows: 1. Assume all contracts can be modelled as financial swaps. 2. Spread the notional trading volumes over the estimated swap tenors. 3. Calculate the value of defaulting at each period of the swap (the default option) using Black's formula. 4. Treat the value of the default options as risky cash flows. That is treat this value just like you would an annuity stream.

"Comments: 1. In the sentence between eqn. 3 and eqn. 4, I think ""annualized volatility"" should replace ""annualized standard deviation."" 2. As to the comment, ""Immediately we see something quite counter-intuitive."" I would disagree. I think that its quite intuitive that this model should get closer to the Black-Scholes price as what is defined as the ""jump"" component becomes just part of the main price distribution, which happens if we define a jump to be only a 1-sigma event. The table does show, however, that the results of using this model are very sensitive to exactly how you choose to define a ""jump"" (i.e. 2-sigma or 3-sigma... events), and this is one difficulty in using the model in practice. 3. In the paragraph after the table, I don't understand the argument about hedging the option. Especially about buying a swap which would pay on the difference between the strike and Fs. This seems non-sensical. 4. I could not follow the logic of the last two sentences of the article, so this point should probably be explained more clearly. --Stinson Vince J Kaminski 08/18/2000 08:15 AM To: Grant Masson/HOU/ECT@ECT, Stinson Gibner/HOU/ECT@ECT, Alex Huang/Corp/Enron@ENRON cc: Subject: Alex's paper Minor changes I made to Alex's paper.

Stinson The model looks great except when I changed an input and hit go it blew up. Maybe I'm doing something wrong. One thing that I would like changed is that I want to make the swap product and product that settles against the 2nd last day. So the role should happen on the second last day not the last day. Please change that if you can.

Vince Stinson Gibner 11/30/2000 06:14 PM To: Alex Huang/Corp/Enron@ENRON cc: Vince J Kaminski/HOU/ECT@ECT, Vasant Shanbhogue/HOU/ECT@ECT Subject: Compound Model for Reedy Creek Alex, Paulo and I have continued to look at the model and have come up with a couple of additional changes. 1. The cash flow calculations need to include the overlying option strike payment. Also, Paulo is trying to clarify if the cashflows should be discounted to the valuation date or reported as notional future values. 2. I would suggest trying changing the option valuation from a binomial tree approach to a one-dimensional integration, perhaps using a quadrature method. This may allow us to minimize the size of the delta discontinuities. 3. Edith is supposed to check and see if the theoretical gamma is used for anything. If it is, we will probably need to revisit the gamma calculation since we are not currently including any cross terms for gamma.
