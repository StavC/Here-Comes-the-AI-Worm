"Jim a BIG external factor that is directed to the item (2) ISO Systems & Procedures: At the NERC Electronic Scheduling Task Force meeting today, there was considerable discussion on how this Task Force (which was formed before the OASIS ANOPR was posted) would coordinate on an industry-wide basis, a NERC response to the OASIS Phase II ANOPR. Here are some important points a FERC Staff member (Marv Rosenberg) made at the meeting. These should be kept in mind in developing the Enron proposal and the process of getting buy-in in each of the Regions/RTOs. - FERC prefers a single industry consensus filing. - The ANOPR is intended to tie RTO Order 2000 together with new OASIS II requirements - Does not preclude individual RTOs or entities from submitting proposals. However a diversity of filings will indicate non-consensus and FERC will make its own decisions which will likely not be industry friendly. FERC is asking the industry for communication and Business Practices standards for issuing in a NOPR. FERC is looking for: - more functionality and to be more user-friendly - electronic scheduling - electronic reservations - reduce duplication of information entry for customers - not intended to dictate the Control Area to Control Area communications I asked Marv to clarify this - He explained that although not required, FERC welcomes propsals to address the control area source/sink issues as part of an OASIS II solution (ie Entergy Source/Sink Order) OASIS II should: - continue use of Web",charles.yeung@enron.com,james.steffes@enron.com,"'Jim' : 'person', 'Marv Rosenberg' : 'person'",2,Re: Transmission / Wholesale Market Regional Plans,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,sent,charles.yeung@enron.com

"NERC's Control Area Criteria Task Force (CACTF) paper on the Reliability Model ""unbundles"" definitionally the functions of a control area. Today's control area is required under NERC policy to meet many reliability requirements for short-term, daily and real-time operations. NERC CACTF identified 4 major areas of function: 1) Security Authority Performs short term security analysis for interchange schedules (between control areas) Administers curtailment procedures (NERC TLR) 2) Interchange Authority Responsible for maintaining a net of interchange schedules that balance at control area interfaces in real-time 3) Balancing Authority Provides real-time dispatch to match energy demand and supply Maintains performance measures such as frequency, and voltage requirements Maintains accounting balance sheets for inadvertent energy between control areas 4) Transmission Service Provider Offers transmission access through a tariff Calculates ATC/TTC and other transfer capability amounts Responsible for accounting line losses 5) Market Participants Includes Purchasing Selling Entities, Generators, and Load Serving Entities It is important to remember that the NERC CACTF Relibility Model describes only FUNCTIONs and does not attempt to restructure a vertically integrated control area that may perform any and all of these functions. The CACTF developed these concepts and explored how to provide comparability and eliminate competitive advantages of control areas.

"Kevin Here is a summary of the work of this task force. Bill Rust has been attending the meetings and I have been closley coordinating our positions. The PFTF set out to develop a means to capture native load impacts (not tagged) in load flow models to ensure that parallel flows resulting from native load dispatch are accounted for accurately to assess system security. This has largely been ignored in the past since most TLRs hit only non-firm PTP transactions. However, the NERC TLR procedures (in line with FERC OATT) requires a pro-rata curtailment of native and network service with Firm point-to-point (PTP). Since more and more TLRs at Level 5 (Firm) have been utilized and is expected to rise, providers are being forced by the MIC to demonstrate comparability at these TLR levels. In order to demonstrate comparability - a transparent calculation of Native and Network impacts is needed. In past, this was left to the discretion of each control area. The task force reviewed 7 methods on how to model native gen to native load dispatch. These seven methods can be grouped into three categories: 1) Continue with the existing method that does not consider counterflows. 2) Inlcude counterflows for NNL (Native/Network Load) and PTP and assign to sink control area. 3) Assign NNL counterflows to the control area and PTP counterflows to the purchasing selling entitiy (PSE). Each method tries to simulate real-time dispatch realizing that an interconnection-wide state estimator is",charles.yeung@enron.com,kevin.presto@enron.com,"'Kevin' : 'person', 'Bill Rust' : 'person'",2,"Parallel Flows Task Force (PFTF) Summary - Bill Rust and Charles

AEP noted that flow on some bulk transmission paths is up 500% to 1000% over what it was in the old days. Nothing specific was discussed about how to address this other than to have early and comprehensive coordination among interested parties so that investments could be made. There was also some concern about new generation interconnection and how those costs should be covered. AEP did not like the current system where they conclude that the system pays all costs of interconnection when generators receive all of the benefit. It was questioned whether or not the system didn't receive a benefit as well, but AEP countered that the current approach does not give any incentive to generation to locate appropriately and that in the end, benefits go to the generator out of proportion to the cost imposed on them.

"The individual RTOs have the upper hand as far as dictating what the scheduling practices will be. This is driven by the fact that the RTO efforts have focused on the scheduling needs internal to their borders. The problem the Electronic Scheduling Collaborative (ESC) faces is trying to define standard business practices for OASIS II now - after most RTOs have taken great steps to defining their own internal scheduling practices. In the West, there is a coordination effort to address the seams between the 3 RTOs (there are some in theEast as well). FERC required in Order 2000, under Function 8, for RTOs to address seams issues. At the ESC workshop last week, several RTOs admitted that Function 8 is lowest on their list of priorities. Several, includig a rep from the West admitted that the real hard seams issues, those that cannot be patched, will likely need FERC involvement to ""force"" a compromise or settlement. The problem is that FERC is taking a light handed approach to the seams problems with acting Chairman Hebert opting to rely on the RTOs themselves to address the seams issues. Our argument, of course, is that these are the entities that have the least incentive to patch the seams. So, by August, the ESC intends to file at FERC the disposition of 26 scheduling practices - whether there is a single standard for each practice, or exactly which ones cannot be agreed upon to be standard (e.g. - losses, ramp rates).",charles.yeung@enron.com,cara.semperger@enron.com,'acting Chairman Hebert' : 'person',1,Re: Electronic Scheduling,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,sent,charles.yeung@enron.com

"Jim a BIG external factor that is directed to the item (2) ISO Systems & Procedures: At the NERC Electronic Scheduling Task Force meeting today, there was considerable discussion on how this Task Force (which was formed before the OASIS ANOPR was posted) would coordinate on an industry-wide basis, a NERC response to the OASIS Phase II ANOPR. Here are some important points a FERC Staff member (Marv Rosenberg) made at the meeting. These should be kept in mind in developing the Enron proposal and the process of getting buy-in in each of the Regions/RTOs. - FERC prefers a single industry consensus filing. - The ANOPR is intended to tie RTO Order 2000 together with new OASIS II requirements - Does not preclude individual RTOs or entities from submitting proposals. However a diversity of filings will indicate non-consensus and FERC will make its own decisions which will likely not be industry friendly. FERC is asking the industry for communication and Business Practices standards for issuing in a NOPR. FERC is looking for: - more functionality and to be more user-friendly - electronic scheduling - electronic reservations - reduce duplication of information entry for customers - not intended to dictate the Control Area to Control Area communications I asked Marv to clarify this - He explained that although not required, FERC welcomes propsals to address the control area source/sink issues as part of an OASIS II solution (ie Entergy Source/Sink Order) OASIS II should: - continue use of Web",charles.yeung@enron.com,james.steffes@enron.com,"'Jim' : 'person', 'Marv Rosenberg' : 'person'",2,Re: Transmission / Wholesale Market Regional Plans,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,sent,charles.yeung@enron.com

Big issues were tied into the Stakeholder's recommendation - changes in governance, voting, funding. The idea of expanding NERC's role is not for the sole purpose of getting NERC to develop business practices - but rather get NERC to recognize the market and commercial needs in its reliability rules. Presently, NERC focuses on reliability rules and considers commercial impacts as a secondary issue. This is what the Stakeholders wish to change.

"Kevin Here is a summary of the work of this task force. Bill Rust has been attending the meetings and I have been closley coordinating our positions. The PFTF set out to develop a means to capture native load impacts (not tagged) in load flow models to ensure that parallel flows resulting from native load dispatch are accounted for accurately to assess system security. This has largely been ignored in the past since most TLRs hit only non-firm PTP transactions. However, the NERC TLR procedures (in line with FERC OATT) requires a pro-rata curtailment of native and network service with Firm point-to-point (PTP). Since more and more TLRs at Level 5 (Firm) have been utilized and is expected to rise, providers are being forced by the MIC to demonstrate comparability at these TLR levels. In order to demonstrate comparability - a transparent calculation of Native and Network impacts is needed. In past, this was left to the discretion of each control area. The task force reviewed 7 methods on how to model native gen to native load dispatch. These seven methods can be grouped into three categories: 1) Continue with the existing method that does not consider counterflows. 2) Inlcude counterflows for NNL (Native/Network Load) and PTP and assign to sink control area. 3) Assign NNL counterflows to the control area and PTP counterflows to the purchasing selling entitiy (PSE). Each method tries to simulate real-time dispatch realizing that an interconnection-wide state estimator is",charles.yeung@enron.com,kevin.presto@enron.com,"'Kevin' : 'person', 'Bill Rust' : 'person'",2,"Parallel Flows Task Force (PFTF) Summary - Bill Rust and Charles

"Rick The following discussion is to bring you up to date on the latest NERC activities on reliability legislation that was a subject on the weekly ENRON-NERC team conference call. John Shelk explained that NERC has significantly reduced the length of its proposed ""Title on Reliability"" so as to look more like the PJM approach. Fundamentally, there are still major differences. NERC continues to push for the embodiment of deference by FERC to the ""SRO"" in the legislation. Given the conference call last week with John Q Anderson, Dave Cook and Jeff Skilling, we were concerned how the upcoming meeting on Aug 9 by NERC stakeholders to ""finalize"" the NERC version would impact Jeff's request to speak with the Independent Board members before accepting any form of deference to NERC to become the SRO (or the term we prefer Standards Setting Organization - SSO). The meeting on the 9th should not interfere with Jeff's ability to present issues to the Board. We don't think Jeff needs to contact John Q Anderson or any NERC members about the Aug 9 meeting. However, for the discussions with NERC, John Shelk plans to ""stay the line"" on the Enron position of keeping authority to defer to any SSO with FERC and to keep any language that defers to the SSO out of the legislation. Jeff should still be able to argue for key Board action items, and if Enron is appeased, deference to NERC could still be given - but not through legislation, rather through FERC ""comfort"" that the SSO is doing a good job.

"On Wed, I met at EPSA to discuss with members - the near term future participation of EPSA staff and members at NERC. A roster of participants follows this brief summary. Most members agreed in concept that NERC must continue to be monitored at least in the near term because of their ""monopoly"" on the reliability/commercial rules. There was agreement that NERC had moved into the commercial/non-reliability standards setting partly becuase the incumbants desgined it that way and partly due to a lack of another industry representative forum for FERC to delegate to. Some members were encouraged that GISB was interested in becoming an alternative forum (EISB) and pointed to GISB successes in creating an efficient Bulletin Board for Gas in response to FERC orders.

"It would not be accurate to conclude or assert that the NERC language is ""close"" to congressional approval. Here is the state of play. There are two interrelated tracks at present: the DeLay, et al negotiations of all stakeholders (which I attended and participated in today but did not concern reliability) and the NERC process that is underway to consider how to bring those such as Enron that are not ""on board"" with the so-called ""consensus"" NERC language (Sarah participated in the Tuesday meeting on this issue, where PJM put a proposal on the table that Sarah advises largely tracks our draft; this process will continue next week and a follow up meeting the week after). The interrelationship is that it is likely that IF (a big IF) there is an electric title that is added to the congressional bill that will start moving in the House subcommittee next week, the NERC version will be included as a ""place holder"" with the understanding that if the NERC discussion process yields a different result, it will be substituted. Furthermore, those who oppose the NERC version would be free to continue opposing it on the Hill and elsewhere. So you might say there is a rebuttable ""presumption"" of sorts in favor of the NERC version (which is shorter than the old NERC version) because so many groups favor it, but those who oppose it such as ourselves continue to seek allies for a shorter, streamlined version. Congress is far from approving any final version.",john.shelk@enron.com,charles.yeung@enron.com,"'DeLay, et al' : 'person', 'Sarah' : 'person', 'PJM' : 'person', 'Sarah' : 'person'",4,RE: Senate Reliability Billl,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,received,charles.yeung@enron.com

"I don't know that NERC has ""given up"" on Enron. The timing of next week's meeting to ""resolve"" the legislation reflects the legislative realities that the committees of jurisdiction in Congress will take up the realibility legislation, along with other electricity issues, as early as the second week of September. In fact, congressional staff in the Senate and House are drafting legislative language on electricity issues during the August recess. They have pressed the ""coalition"" for a final work product. I gathered that at least some of what Jeff'spresentation to the NERC board would be about concerns matters beyond the legislation as such, but since they go to the NERC board's operation and independence, may go to our comfort level with NERC as the standards setting organization. Given the issues and concerns that have been addressed and communicated to NERC, and our preference for the PJM model (as Jeff told John Q. Anderson in the conference call), I think NERC got the information it wanted to get out of the call even though it didn't like the answers: i.e., whether Sarah and I have been faithfully representing Enron's position, whether Enron supports an ""SRO"" type organization; and whether there is anything they can do to get us on board. Perhaps we should have another conference call early next week so that Sarah and I have our guidance from everyone going into the August 9th meeting.

"It would not be accurate to conclude or assert that the NERC language is ""close"" to congressional approval. Here is the state of play. There are two interrelated tracks at present: the DeLay, et al negotiations of all stakeholders (which I attended and participated in today but did not concern reliability) and the NERC process that is underway to consider how to bring those such as Enron that are not ""on board"" with the so-called ""consensus"" NERC language (Sarah participated in the Tuesday meeting on this issue, where PJM put a proposal on the table that Sarah advises largely tracks our draft; this process will continue next week and a follow up meeting the week after). The interrelationship is that it is likely that IF (a big IF) there is an electric title that is added to the congressional bill that will start moving in the House subcommittee next week, the NERC version will be included as a ""place holder"" with the understanding that if the NERC discussion process yields a different result, it will be substituted. Furthermore, those who oppose the NERC version would be free to continue opposing it on the Hill and elsewhere. So you might say there is a rebuttable ""presumption"" of sorts in favor of the NERC version (which is shorter than the old NERC version) because so many groups favor it, but those who oppose it such as ourselves continue to seek allies for a shorter, streamlined version. Congress is far from approving any final version.",john.shelk@enron.com,charles.yeung@enron.com,"'DeLay, et al' : 'person', 'Sarah' : 'person', 'PJM' : 'person', 'Sarah' : 'person'",4,RE: Senate Reliability Billl,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,received,charles.yeung@enron.com

Dave Nevius of NERC explained the current draft of the so-called stakeholder ""consensus"" bill, and Bobby Lamb presented the competing proposal being advanced by PJM. After these presentations, Nevius and Lamb responded to numerous questions. Thereafter, EPSA members discussed the relative merits of the two proposals, concluding with a straw poll indicating support for exploring an alternative to NERC's bill. Specifically, EPSA members expressed general dissatisfaction with the new, ""streamlined"" version of the NERC bill. Additionally, serious doubts exist regarding the possibility of revising the language in the NERC bill in any way that would make it acceptable. General observations about the fundamental aspects of the NERC bill indicated that people are not comfortable shifting authority away form FERC to an overly complex, prescriptive organization with uncertain delegation",jgallagher@epsa.org,charles.yeung@enron.com,"'Scott A.

Also, if Enron Online wants Enron in the middle of every transaction as a sleeve (unlike a third party bid/offer platform), then we need to consider that since all MRD transactions are physical, this will add to the FERC costs that Enron will pay (at least until we get a final rule from FERC on costs).

Can you imagine the ""fun"" someone is going to have if a Region, say SPP, MAIN, MAPP, WSCC, or FRCC, has a major blackout this summer and the ""loyal opposition"" ""discovers"" that said region has refused to sign an agreement such as this and not implemented the program required by the agreement. That may even constitute ""willful neglect."" Wouldn't it be even worst if the ""discovery"" showed that the region was not signed because the region wanted to use it's position as a bargaining ploy?
