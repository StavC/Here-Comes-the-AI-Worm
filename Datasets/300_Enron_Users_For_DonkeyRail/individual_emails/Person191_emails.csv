I layered on an additional 5 year commitment on the 240/day to cover some of the gap but we were still short of targets. I then modified the debt term to 20 years which should be acceptable as the project would be supported for that length by the extended term and that covers an additional portion of the gap. However, we are still short of our target and my calculations indicate a need to have 22/day @ $0.25 starting in year 3 and lasting through year 20 to make up the difference. In the alternative, a rate of $0.267 with the 20 year term and 20 year debt note also gets us there. All in all, neither one is that big of a hill to climb so we know what we are looking at.

"Mr. Joergensen, A big ""Howdy"" from your Texas friend. I was so glad to get your voice message the other day (week). It is always nice to pick up a voicemail and have it turn out to be a colleague from the not so distant past. I hope you and your family are doing well. As EBS changed direction, I did as well. I decided to get back to my roots in the gas and gas asset business. I looked inside of Enron and also with some outside companies and decided to work with Transwestern pipeline (an Enron company). I've been here for about a month and all is well. The people here are very nice and very genuine (just like my old friends from London). It is weird to actually have a product to sell - if you know what I mean. I think I'll like it but I'm already missing my travels in your neck of the woods. Also, I'm home so much now, my wife doesn't know what to do with me. I'm still saddened by the demised of our Blockbuster/VOD deal. It was a great concept and it worked. Oh well. We'll see it someday, I'm just not sure who is going to win the race on getting it to the public in bulk. Christian sent an email to me and he seems to be doing fine, loving Rio but still looking for a job. Speaking of that, I hope your job is going well and as secure as it can be in today's climate.

"Mark, ""Godav"" to you too. And great to hear from you again. Yes, certainly the world has changed since we last met. As it turned out I was in the Enron building in London when it all happened on Sep 11. And to all of us in London, that moment has been as defining as it has been to you in the States. - With one exception: We have had terrorism here for a very long time. So much so that I have learned to tell the difference between the sounds of an IRA semtex bomb and a Palestinian fertiliser one... And life goes on. I keep reminding everybody how many people die in the traffic every day, and that I shall have to go someday anyway. So even though London probably is high on the hit list, I have not changed my lifestyle significantly. Now it looks like EBS definitively is closing down in Europe. Personally if find it a shame, since I rather valued the people in the group, but probably it was inevitable. But I am pleased that you have moved into the Oil and Gas part of Enron. Whatever the current woes of Enron Corp, that sector is doing fine as a whole. My own stray into telecomms components did not last long. I was out after 3 months on the back of completely collapsing sales in the US. Now I have ventured into Executive Search, where I am working as COO for a small group with 70 staff in 10 countries. I am not ""hunting"" myself, but rather involved in corporate issues such as reporting contracts and business development.

"Mark: The following are certain Right-of-Way needs and/or questions. 1. Are the ROW records located in Salt Lake City or Long Beach, CA? 2. Does Questar have a ROW data base? If so, can they prepare a report, which would identify product limitation (i.e. Crude Oil specific), multiple line rights, pipeline size limitations, assignability, consent, etc. 3. An Encroachment report. 4. A Rental/Term report. 5. A report identifying any known curative problems. 6. Can they identify whether the following problems that existed in 1997 have been cured? a. BLM issues RE: Contract Purchasers vs. Land Patents b. Pipeline lies outside of defined R/W in certain locations c. Railroad licenses sold to municipal entities that may have required new terms and rental amounts d. Relocations i. Anaheim Hills ii. Morongo Indian Tribe (possible Union Pacific Railroad R/W longitudinal occupation vs. private) e. Franchise Agreements 7.

"I'm glad you can make it. To get to the OU course from I-35, take State Highway 9 East toward campus. Exit left (North) on Jenkins. Go past Lloyd Noble Center and turn right (at signal light) on Constitution. Go about 1/2 mile and turn left onto Par Drive. They will start serving lunch about 11:30 and will put out range balls before then. Some people start showing up around 10:30 or earlier to hit balls before lunch. I'll be there much earlier. We have a shotgun start at 1:00. FYI: The following Sig Eps (26) are currently signed up to play: You, me, Chris Walker, Jon Armstrong, Craig Perkins, Scott Smith, David Newman, Scott Weed, Greg Dial, Bruce Kennedy, Todd Skinner, Brian Cain, Kevin Holland, Thomas Burleson, Rick Sheer, John Payne, Brad McNeese, Jeff James, Bradley Watson, Bradford Watson, Joe Ong, Chip Long, Chris Papasarantou, Brad Culver, Jeff Marley and Brad Schick.
