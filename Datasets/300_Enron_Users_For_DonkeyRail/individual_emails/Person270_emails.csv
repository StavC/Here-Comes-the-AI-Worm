Apologies for that. I was and still am, seeking input on the whole issue of the level of written control procedures we should have and the best way to achieve that. When I first started here I was a little surprised at the lack of written procedures. While I believe the actual control structure is good, there is very little in writing, even in the most generic form. In discussing this with Paul Quilkey, he noted that policy, at least when he was in Houston, was to deliberately minimise the written procedures to prevent it being too transportable. The reason for my query is that I last week looked at SCOR, a control review process marketed by the Aust Financial Markets Association.

I've jotted down what I know about each person and I hope you find it useful. I've organized it from most experienced to least experienced. If you would like to talk me about any of these people or ask me to contact them, just let me know. Andy Dunn - until 2 weeks ago he was a director in the PwC risk management practice. Due to a falling out between Andy and the partners (not client related), he left the firm. He is extremely well respected by both the audit and the non-audit personnel, and his leaving came as an unexpected surprise. I have worked with him on a number of occasions and would highly recommend him to Enron. The downside to Andy is that he lives in Denver, is used to travelling a lot, but, at the last time we spoke (a few months ago), is not interested in leaving Denver. His cell phone (if still in use) is 303 807 0040. Mark (Allan) Smith - Mark is in the PwC energy risk management practice in Houston. We worked very closely together throughout 1999 on projects for Coral Energy and Equiva trading. Prior to working at PwC, Mark was at BP for 15 years where he had many different roles (he worked as a crude trader, products trader, he worked in the risk management department, in the refinery itself as an engineer).

For six months we chased Invasion Debt and finally received enough information to put it on the MPR in August (only after it was placed in Raptor I). Also, about six months ago, John Lavorato asked about an asset called CNR Warrants that showed up on the ""hot list"" but we were told by Canada that they were going to sell it so they did not want it on the MPR. Today, we were told that Kyle Kitagawa wanted to sell an asset called Genoil (approx. 4.7 million shares). Again, we did not know that they owned this investment. We have contacted Donna Lowry about Genoil because Beau Canada is on the restricted list and think Genoil would be, too. A trip to Canada may be necessary in order to reinforce our full disclosure policies regarding the MPR. Please let me know if I can provide any additional information.

"Just remember that the DPR is used as an accounting tool as well. despite my constant reminders that it is a tool for reporting daily trading results and positions against board approved limits. So do approach this as fact-finding; and then I would suggest reviewing any recommendations that you may have with Wes Colwell and the RAC group before any changes are made. Looks like a good group. I hope that all will attend and participate. Did Pam do some due diligence for you before sending this e:mail so that you know this date and time works for everyone?

In order to be able to set up books in RisktRAC, the only role that currently exists is the Risk Controls group, who has access to all books, hierarchies etc (all groups, all commodities). With NetCo coming on line, the Risk Controls group has been asked to approve RisktRAC access to the new NetCo controls group so they can set up the new gas books that have been requested. I am uncomfortable granting access to NetCo personnel, as they would be able to see all the estate info, including Europe, EIM, EGM, ENA etc. Also, it is my understanding that the IT groups are working on splitting out the systems but will not be able to do so until after these books have to be set up (deadline for them is next Monday). As such, I recommend the following: In order to ensure there is a segration between NetCo and the estate, until the systems are segregated, the IT groups should be responsible for setting up books, curves etc. How does that sound?

"Shona Thanks for the meeting yesterday - I think the process does improve the transparency and accountability of issues raised. After the call I mentioned to Ted that the meetings might be 'more efficient' if the specific issues identified during doorstep visits - that underpin report comments - were validated by the direct controller on 'point' for the office/business - in this case Marcelo. Ted replied that no harm came from the current approach and to a certain degree I agree that it is good to get an immediate collective response to issues raised !However, I thought we could discuss this for future meetings ( it could be part of the 'how to do a doorstep review' that my guys requested so they are ready to do their individual reviews next year ) -will call later Additionally, I thought I would confirm with you the actions I took down Marcelo and yourself to identify/communciate the specific control concerns identified that were not part of the core tasks transfered Marcelo to add these to existing process efficiencies ( such as systems improvements etc ) and give a full timeline for all 'doorstep' issues Tim to send details of outward bound Commercial instructions and to validate that no specfic exceptions have been recorded to date.

"Shona: Thank you for your memo. I think it is a good idea to define roles and responsibilities and I appreciate the fact that you have taken the initiative to do so. However, I do have the following comments: 1) I have some accountability to Rick Buy for the success of this effort, therefore I (or my designee) need to be involved in Doorstep pre- planning and post-mortem. I will be involved in reviewing the final report before presentation and will attend the meeting when the report is presented to Buy and Causey. 2) I realize that in the interest of getting a review done timely it is sometimes necessary to ""divide and conquer"". However, where logistically possible, I believe that it makes sense for my people to be involved in meetings held with Commercial personnel. This facilitates understanding operations, document flow, points of contact, report writing as well as furthering our goal of educating ""multi-functional"" people so that we can continue to reduce the resources necessary to perform these reviews. 3) There are still some detailed issues that need to be clarified regarding the database.

"Shona: Thank you for your memo. I think it is a good idea to define roles and responsibilities and I appreciate the fact that you have taken the initiative to do so. However, I do have the following comments: 1) I have some accountability to Rick Buy for the success of this effort, therefore I (or my designee) need to be involved in Doorstep pre- planning and post-mortem. I will be involved in reviewing the final report before presentation and will attend the meeting when the report is presented to Buy and Causey. 2) I realize that in the interest of getting a review done timely it is sometimes necessary to ""divide and conquer"". However, where logistically possible, I believe that it makes sense for my people to be involved in meetings held with Commercial personnel. This facilitates understanding operations, document flow, points of contact, report writing as well as furthering our goal of educating ""multi-functional"" people so that we can continue to reduce the resources necessary to perform these reviews. 3) There are still some detailed issues that need to be clarified regarding the database. Let's schedule another meeting with Cassandra and Donna. Please let me know if you have any questions, Regards, Rick",rick.carson@enron.com,shona.wilson@enron.com,"'Shona' : 'person', 'Rick Buy' : 'person', 'Causey' : 'person', 'Cassandra' : 'person', 'Donna' : 'person'",5,Re: updates to processes,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,received,shona.wilson@enron.com
