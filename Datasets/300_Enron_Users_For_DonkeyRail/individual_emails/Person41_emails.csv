"thanks. Soundlike we're OK. I will need to get access to the global trading directory to post P&L sheet.

Charles Subject: RE: P&L (Sheet 10-3-01) Charlie, Please start saving your files out to o, global_trading, finacial_trading, texas trading. I can get to that and reconcile our p&l's. Our variation from last nights physical part of the p&l is really about $597 when you factor in the the mirant new deal valued at -$2025. We valued the texoma true up $340 different, leading me to believe we have a little diff. in starting positions. I am requesting access to all the global trading files so I can see what you are using for the position. The remaining variance is due to an imbalance on both Katy and Texoma for the 1st (Katy 10,000, Texoma -10,000). Collectively, you are balanced but do have 1/day of risk at each location, which amounted to $200. So, we are pretty close on the p&l.

The only way he knows of is to use a NMR (nuclear magnetic resonance) machine that NASA uses to analyze rocket fuel.

We were told to update the model (and all pricing) so we know where we stand on our valuation at this point. Can you please update the gas price for us when you have a chance?

"Attached is the spreadsheet Eric and I have used to determine the quantity of MMBTU's that need to be sold to Barclay's to account for unwinding 3% of the total KCS hedges. We calculated 3% of the hedged MMBTU's in the small VPP, 3% of the hedged MMBTU's in the large VPP, and 3% of the hedged oil MMBTUE to come up with the total MMBTUE that will be sold to Barclay's. The oil MMBTUE's have been included in the large VPP gas hedge. Additionally, as has been widely discussed, the actual financial volumes hedged are slightly less than the actual physical volumes due to the fact that the payout on some of the properties was paid at less than 100% of index. This lower payout % was compensated for when booked by applying that same % to the volumes at full index price, thus resulting in an exact match on the cash flows hedged. Our calculation of the total gas hedged volumes as a percentage of total physical volumes is on the ""Support"" page Cell S2 and came to 99.4% (FYI). In any case, by applying a 3% multiplier to the hedged volumes (hedged at the full index price), we can determine the quantity of MMBTU's that will make up 3% of the cash flow hedge.

He has experience doing radio spots, tv, print (signs, billboards) for various levels of campaigns. I think he sees the vast marketing potential and national position that GOPUSA has to offer and he wants to be involved.

The scope would be web design, media, advertising, and on and on.

Below are the docs for review. The new funding vehicle will be named KSTAR VPP LIMITED PARTNERSHIP (hoping I can shorten it to LP). I wanted to have your group in the loop because this WILL require a counterparty name change in the system. I am not sure of the effective date yet, but we will make it effective the 1st of the month. I asked legal why we have to change the name and they informed me that because of the financial structure of the deal, the banks want to know that this VPP is a newly formed entity with no prior business and no prior liabilities associated with it. From a financial perspective, all business activity before syndication is done as STAR VPP, LP and all business done after syndication will be done as KSTAR VPP LIMITED PARTNERSHIP. Believe me, I wish we could avoid the name change, but there is no way around it. Once the contract details are fine tuned we can meet up on the process of the name change.

"Charlie, They basically want to fix the NYMEX and Basis for a potential VPP transaction. This is pretty straight forward. Just set up swap model, one for each of the points listed below. Use the indicated 5,000 mmbtu/d as the volume. It will be a 10 year deal, with the quotes split out for each of the first 5 years and then one number for the tail. This would be a good one to talk to Dutch about (individual yearly quotes vs. one swap quote). We might also want to have the same discussion with the basis traders.

"[IMAGE] IntercontinentalExchange is pleased to announce that weather swaps trading will be included in its new version 8 release. These fixed-for-floating financial products will be cash settled on a five-day average temperature, Monday - Friday, for the current week and for the forward week. Temperatures used for the settlement of these products will be those reported by EarthSat, a widely recognized and independent source of weather data. Settlement temperatures provided by EarthSat will be available via the IntercontinentalExchange website. The hub locations for weather trades will be the primary airport weather stations at Chicago-O'Hare, Dallas-Fort Worth, New York-La Guardia, Philadelphia-International and Sacramento-Executive. The standard contract size for all locations will be $10,000 per degree Fahrenheit, with a tic increment of 0.1 degree Fahrenheit or $1,000. There are no payout limits on the contracts. The design and development of these new weather products was done under the guidance of Aquila Energy Marketing Corp., a recognized leader in weather product concepts. In addition, IntercontinentalExchange has worked with Aquila and other major weather market participants, including Reliant Energy, Mirant Americas, and El Paso Merchant Energy, to build consensus and support for these new products. To trade weather swaps you must have our new version 8 release installed on your system. An advisory with details about this new release is being sent to you by separate email.

"Dear Intern Buddy - Thank you for volunteering to assist the Analyst/Associate Program with candidate cultivation this summer. Summer internships are very important to the overall success of our program and we need your help to insure that our interns have enjoyable and meaningful experiences this summer. We have assigned you to be Michael Finger's summer buddy. To kick off the summer, the A/A Program will be hosting a ""Meet the Pool"" party on Thursday June 7th at the Hyatt Regency from 5:00PM to 9:00 PM. We would like for you to use this opportunity to meet your summer buddy and to introduce them to others in the pool. Please make contact with your buddy as soon as possible to make plans to attend the party together. In addition to attending this party together, we would like for you to spend a little time each week with your buddy. We will send out an email next week with some suggested things for you and your buddy to do together. Whether it is lunch or a simple phone call, your continued interaction with these interns could make a difference in the intern's decision to join Enron fulltime. Suggestions from you are always welcomed! As we progress through the summer, please make an attempt to gain insight into your buddy's internship. Any feedback from them regarding their summer experiences will be welcomed, positive or negative. If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me at x35275. Thanks again for your help.

"Yes he is. This is just outrageous. He gets elected to a brand new, six-year term, and then jumps ship when its a 50-50 senate. It's BS. PS - As per your request...
