"NOAA ANNOUNCES NEW ""ENVIRONOMICS"" PROGRAM THAT LINKS WEATHER, CLIMATE TO ECONOMY Data Show Effect of Climate Conditions on Corn and Soybean Yield and Residential Energy Needs October 24, 2001 - NOAA <http://www.noaa.gov/> today unveiled two new indices that evaluate the effect of climate conditions on corn and soybean yield and on residential energy needs. The development of the indices is part of NOAA's ""Environomics"" program <http://lwf.ncdc.noaa.gov/oa/climate/research/environomics/environomics.html>, an effort to better understand the impact of weather and climate on socioeconomic sectors of the nation. The indices were developed by NOAA's National Climatic Data Center <http://lwf.ncdc.noaa.gov/oa/ncdc.html> in Asheville, N.C., which maintains the world's largest weather database. (Click NOAA image for larger view of standardized temperature index for Sept. 2001.) Anecdotal statements about the weather are often used to explain variations in economic activity, and these statements are often based on perceptions about the weather that may or may not be valid. Through NOAA's Environomics program, relationships between the nation's climate and vital economic sectors of the nation are clearly defined using climate indices, which enhance the understanding of how year-to-year variations and trends in weather and climate affect associated sectors.

"NOAA ANNOUNCES NEW ""ENVIRONOMICS"" PROGRAM THAT LINKS WEATHER, CLIMATE TO ECONOMY Data Show Effect of Climate Conditions on Corn and Soybean Yield and Residential Energy Needs October 24, 2001 - NOAA <http://www.noaa.gov/> today unveiled two new indices that evaluate the effect of climate conditions on corn and soybean yield and on residential energy needs. The development of the indices is part of NOAA's ""Environomics"" program <http://lwf.ncdc.noaa.gov/oa/climate/research/environomics/environomics.html>, an effort to better understand the impact of weather and climate on socioeconomic sectors of the nation. The indices were developed by NOAA's National Climatic Data Center <http://lwf.ncdc.noaa.gov/oa/ncdc.html> in Asheville, N.C., which maintains the world's largest weather database. (Click NOAA image for larger view of standardized temperature index for Sept. 2001.) Anecdotal statements about the weather are often used to explain variations in economic activity, and these statements are often based on perceptions about the weather that may or may not be valid. Through NOAA's Environomics program, relationships between the nation's climate and vital economic sectors of the nation are clearly defined using climate indices, which enhance the understanding of how year-to-year variations and trends in weather and climate affect associated sectors.

If the merger between Enron and Dynegy closes, all terms and provisions of the option awards before the close are preserved through and after the close except: (1) number of options in Dynegy will be number of Enron options before the merger times the merger ration of .2685 (2) the strike price for Dynegy options will be the strike price of Enron options before the merger divided by the merger ration of .2685 The proposed transaction is considered an ""approved"" change in control for purposes of the Enron Corp. stock plans.

"Tyrell, I have made some revisions to the latest drafts of the letter agreement and your cover letter. Please review. As I noted earlier, Barry indicated he had some language that he wanted to revise concerning the mark to market. I have not been able to contact him yet. So unless Mark and Barry have talked, probably need to hold these until you or I hear from Barry. Also, if we are going to do any of these transaction with a Canadian party, Peter Keohane and Eric Ledain need to comment on this form. I have sent them an earlier version and I am copying them here. I will be in a meeting until about 3:30 pm central and will be available after that. I again want to reiterate, that if the assignment takes place after the firm transport agreements are signed, Kern could require the assignment to be done via the capacity release bidding procedures of their tariff. I noticed that one of the packages is less than 1 year in term. This means it could also be bid up in excess of max rate. Anything over 1 year could only be bid to max rate. We may want to add a provision that to the extent the capacity is assigned via capacity release and it is bid up beyond max rate, ENA will have no obilgation to take the capacity and make the mark to market payment.

As I noted earlier, Barry indicated he had some language that he wanted to revise concerning the mark to market. I have not been able to contact him yet. So unless Mark and Barry have talked, probably need to hold these until you or I hear from Barry. Also, if we are going to do any of these transaction with a Canadian party, Peter Keohane and Eric Ledain need to comment on this form. I have sent them an earlier version and I am copying them here. I will be in a meeting until about 3:30 pm central and will be available after that. I again want to reiterate, that if the assignment takes place after the firm transport agreements are signed, Kern could require the assignment to be done via the capacity release bidding procedures of their tariff. I noticed that one of the packages is less than 1 year in term. This means it could also be bid up in excess of max rate. Anything over 1 year could only be bid to max rate. We may want to add a provision that to the extent the capacity is assigned via capacity release and it is bid up beyond max rate, ENA will have no obilgation to take the capacity and make the mark to market payment.
