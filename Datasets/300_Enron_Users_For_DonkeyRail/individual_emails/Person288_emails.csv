"Hi - I just wanted to give you a quick run down on the meeting yesterday. Three people spoke at the meeting - Jeff McMahon, Louise and Philippe. There was a lot of attention given to EnronOnline and it's success. Greg Whalley spoke via satellite from London. The basic theme was what it is going to take to survive in today's fast moving markets and how we are going to get there, and that in five years all businesses will be Internet companies or not companies at all..... Greg spoke briefly about what we were going to do to upgrade and expand existing platforms and the fact that no other player in the industry can do this but us because of our financial capabilities, reputation, and IT resources. Louise went over statistics, products offered, etc. on EnronOnline. Philippe discussed all the IT projects in the works - the key one for ENA was enhancement of deal capture, valuation and settlements (no surprises there!). One other common theme was streamlining our current systems. He also confirmed the fact that we were moving from Lotus Notes to Exchange, and discussed the fact that we were running out of space in the building for our equipment (and the ability to keep the room cool) so they were looking to Ardmore for this. Jeff M. stated that we were looking for opportunities to capitalize on inefficiencies in the market, and get into other industries (e.g. MG Metals in Europe). He also stated that Enron was going to Venture Capitalists for financial support and backing. Of course, this means that Enron will have",sheri.thomas@enron.com,sally.beck@enron.com,"'Jeff McMahon' : 'person', 'Louise' : 'person', 'Philippe' : 'person', 'Greg Whalley' : 'person', 'Louise' : 'person', 'Philippe' : 'person'",6,Enron NetWorks offsite,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,sent,sheri.thomas@enron.com
"I just wanted to give you an update on where we are on the PCG wish list. We discussed about a month ago the fact that we had close to 200 items on our list of development/enhancements to our applications. We met on numerous occasions with Mark D. and team to prioritize, etc. However, I think primarily due to the reorg in IT, and Mark leaving the team, we have done a lot of talking over the past three weeks, but nothing has happened to date. Jennifer and I met with Hal Elrod yesterday, and I have met with Bob Hillier a couple of times, and we seem to be on the right track now. I know Bob Hiller is looking for people in his group to support these needs. My concern is growing due to the fact that Andrew Parsons and team will be re-auditing us before the end of the year. The key control weakness of the PCG was the lack of Profiles Manger - I have stressed that this is #1 on the list of things to do. I think we are fairly close, but we will need to start and complete testing over the next several weeks. My hope is that we push Andrew back as far as possible!

We had three US Gas deals, and two Canadian Gas deals). After 4pm, the bridges would automatically roll new EOL deals to the next day.

"You asked yesterday if any of us had any comments on the Analyst PRC process... I thought I would share a few things with you. The primary concern was that an individual was representing ""our"" people, and they 1) did not know them 2) did not know what they did 3) probably could not adequately answer questions about that person and his/her performance and job responsibilities. Although I think the manager's in my group did an excellent job of providing feedback and accomplishments (the two analysts rankings in our group did not change from excellent), they were really uneasy about someone independent of our group representing them. Also, in general, it seems like the analysts are getting conflicting messages about the ""third"" rotation and the option of going back to school, staying with the company, etc. I think a good idea would be to provide some clear, written message to the analysts and us about the program and how it is going to work going forward.

We discussed about a month ago the fact that we had close to 200 items on our list of development/enhancements to our applications. We met on numerous occasions with Mark D. and team to prioritize, etc. However, I think primarily due to the reorg in IT, and Mark leaving the team, we have done a lot of talking over the past three weeks, but nothing has happened to date. Jennifer and I met with Hal Elrod yesterday, and I have met with Bob Hillier a couple of times, and we seem to be on the right track now. I know Bob Hiller is looking for people in his group to support these needs. My concern is growing due to the fact that Andrew Parsons and team will be re-auditing us before the end of the year. The key control weakness of the PCG was the lack of Profiles Manger - I have stressed that this is #1 on the list of things to do. I think we are fairly close, but we will need to start and complete testing over the next several weeks. My hope is that we push Andrew back as far as possible!

"I talked to each of you a couple of weeks ago, and this topic got pushed aside due to some other pressing issues. However, each of you agreed that a standard cutoff time was acceptable for US gas, power and liquids products. The best option will be to agree to cutoff at 4pm each day (just to get an idea of the numbers we were talking about, I looked at yesterday to determine how many deals were traded after 4pm Houston time. We had three US Gas deals, and two Canadian Gas deals). After 4pm, the bridges would automatically roll new EOL deals to the next day. However, for those deals that do not bridge after 4pm, the various risk groups would need to remember that these deals are the following day's business. I am not sure how the procedures in Risk would need to be modified for the trader's position reports, as the official books would not include these late deals. Can Risk run supplemental reports to ensure that the desks have accurate positions each morning?

"Sheri: The physical power products on DynegyDirect have now been approved, with the exception of the West firm product. Thus, go ahead and set up the East power traders to trade physical power on behalf of EPMI. Do not set up any West traders to trade on DynegyDirect until you receive confirmation from me that the West products are okay. Please make clear to the power traders that they may trade ONLY physical power with their EPMI passwords. If they want to trade financial power products, they must obtain an ENA password (since Enron North America, not Enron Power Marketing is the Enron entity that trades derivative products). There are a couple of changes to the power swaps currently posted that need to be made before I can approve the issuance of passwords to trade financial products (plus I want Brent Hendry's sign off as well).

"Sheri - I don't remember being consulted about sending these documents by e-mail (but that doesn't mean it didn't happen - just that I don't remember it).

Clickpaper has been instructed not to send password applications to customers via e-mail. This is something we have been doing since the inception of EnronOnline. The concern is that customers will alter the language in the agreement, sign and return it to us - hopefully, this will not happen, but could be a valid concern. I am hoping you can shed some light on the original decision that was made to allow sending the PAs to customers electronically. One solution that we could implement in the future is to send the file to the customer in .pdf format; however, the customer will need the applicable software to launch the program (we could include a link to download this). The immediate solution is to discontinue this practice until I have discussed it with you. I know you are out of the office until Monday, and I am out the rest of the week as well.

Enron would execute to the counterparty a termination agreement per deal the counterparty wanted to back out. My concerns for the first option are: 1. This potentially would not create a true net effect- timing from the EOL trade and the phone call to execute the OTC could have price differences 2. The confirmation process is impacted, would have to generate 2 confirms, one for each side of the trade 3.

"Sheri: The physical power products on DynegyDirect have now been approved, with the exception of the West firm product. Thus, go ahead and set up the East power traders to trade physical power on behalf of EPMI. Do not set up any West traders to trade on DynegyDirect until you receive confirmation from me that the West products are okay. Please make clear to the power traders that they may trade ONLY physical power with their EPMI passwords. If they want to trade financial power products, they must obtain an ENA password (since Enron North America, not Enron Power Marketing is the Enron entity that trades derivative products). There are a couple of changes to the power swaps currently posted that need to be made before I can approve the issuance of passwords to trade financial products (plus I want Brent Hendry's sign off as well). The following lawyers must approve the commodity groups set out below before you can proceed to set up additional users of Dynegy Direct: Dan Hyvl: Physical Gas Marcus Nettelton: Liquids (products plus on-line General Terms and Conditions to be approved) Brent Hendry: Financial Products The ENA gas traders will only need to receive one password for physical and financial products. However, the liquids traders will, like the EPMI traders, receive an EGL password for physical liquid products and an ENA password for financial liquid products, and will need to be instructed that they need to use the passwords accordingly.

We have emphasized the importance of stressing to our customers that a deal transacted via EnronOnline is a binding/legal transaction, but we have continued to see a few of these deals occur. In summary, we have had a total of 33 killed transactions since inception, the majority of which have been with Aquila (5), Koch (8), and internal trades (13). Obviously, the ones that concern us the most are those transactions with third parties, and most of these have been due to claimed web latency and transactions not appearing on the customer's summary report.
