"Davis' criticism of Texas misdirected, report finds Lynda Gledhill, Mark Martin, Chronicle Staff Writers Tuesday, July 10, 2001 ,2001 San Francisco Chronicle URL: http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2001/07/10/M N48875.DTL Sacramento -- Texas-based electricity generators have received the brunt of criticism from Gov. Gray Davis for gouging California during the power crisis, but financial information released yesterday shows the lion's share of the money went elsewhere. Companies with headquarters in Texas garnered less than 10 percent of California's multibillion-dollar energy purchases, while public and private energy companies from Canada to Georgia to California got the rest. The $424 million that went to Texas companies may still be more than the state should have been charged, and administration officials are attempting to get refunds from a host of companies, both in and out of Texas. Earlier this year, Davis lambasted the Bush administration for not acting against power firms in his home state. ""What's going on here, pure and simple, is unconscionable price-gouging by the big energy producers -- most of them, incidentally, located in Texas,"" he said in May. Yesterday, a spokesman for the governor broadened the verbal assault, saying the Texas firms are representative of the many other out-of-state generators who have also gouged California.

"Group, Here's the raw data from the California poll. Great news, here. As you can see by the progression of the numbers, by slightly changing the message, we went from getting killed by the Davis plan to actually breaking even with it and even beating it significantly. Some takeaways: 1. By using the right words, a competing/alternate plan to the governor's will win in the polls. 2. Education is at least as important as electricity. 3. The thought of wiping out the budget surplus by spending it on the grid, rather than schools and hospitals, tilts the scales in our favor. 4. Finally, by broadening the demand buy-down program to ""consumers,"" we win the argument by a wide margin. Next steps: Take a look at the results. Pay special attention to how the words matter, especially on the questions where our results improved as we altered the message. By late Monday, we'll have the crosstabs. We won't have the full analysis and presentation until Friday, though, so I don't think we should share the poll with anybody until then. We could use a few of the numbers in the business letter and with VERY good friends in the Assembly. The key questions are 19, 21, 24, 45 (look at how a change in wording changed the results), 46 (another example of better wording yielding better results, especially on the March 8 poll), 49, 50, 51 (in particular, March 7-8 poll).

MOORLACH Mr. Moorlach is the Orange County treasurer-tax collector. A recent L.A. Times poll found that Californians still remain unconvinced that our state suffers from a shortage of energy. Perhaps the state's subsidizing of the actual costs for electricity these past five months has caused us to believe that everything is fine. It is not. The state has been spending an average of $57 million, a medium-sized city's annual budget, per day for electricity. Now California is headed toward the same financial catastrophe that was imposed on its shareholder-owned utilities, finding one of them in Chapter 11 bankruptcy and another on the precipice. At this pace, it will not be long before the state will be staring a Chapter 9 bankruptcy filing in the face. That's why I'm gnawed by this ""d,j. vu"" sensation. The similarities and parallels between California of 2001 and Orange County of 1994 are frightening. Here's a refresher. In 1994 the county, through former Treasurer Robert Citron, was borrowing at variable rates and investing at fixed rates. The ""experts"" and the ""politicos"" were comfortable with the investment scheme. No wonder the electorate was convinced that there were no investing improprieties.

"Davis' criticism of Texas misdirected, report finds Lynda Gledhill, Mark Martin, Chronicle Staff Writers Tuesday, July 10, 2001 ,2001 San Francisco Chronicle URL: http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2001/07/10/M N48875.DTL Sacramento -- Texas-based electricity generators have received the brunt of criticism from Gov. Gray Davis for gouging California during the power crisis, but financial information released yesterday shows the lion's share of the money went elsewhere. Companies with headquarters in Texas garnered less than 10 percent of California's multibillion-dollar energy purchases, while public and private energy companies from Canada to Georgia to California got the rest. The $424 million that went to Texas companies may still be more than the state should have been charged, and administration officials are attempting to get refunds from a host of companies, both in and out of Texas. Earlier this year, Davis lambasted the Bush administration for not acting against power firms in his home state. ""What's going on here, pure and simple, is unconscionable price-gouging by the big energy producers -- most of them, incidentally, located in Texas,"" he said in May. Yesterday, a spokesman for the governor broadened the verbal assault, saying the Texas firms are representative of the many other out-of-state generators who have also gouged California.

Here's the result: Kirk Johnson's September 26th article, Debate on Need for New Power Plants Ignores Conservation, leaves readers with the misperception that competitive electricity markets discourage conservation. True customer choice proves otherwise. My company supplies electricity to a number of businesses in Maine. One of these customers is a paper mill that uses more electricity than thousands of homes. When New England power prices temporarily spiked last May, we actually paid the mill to shut down ... which they were more than happy to do. As a result, the customer made money, the grid worked better, and residential customers didn't hear a word about ""brownouts."" The financial rewards in the open market create much better incentives to conserve than do the bureaucratic, one-size-fits-all programs of the regulatory elite. It's proving true in Maine, why not give New York and other states the same choice? Dan Allegretti Enron Corp. If you like it, send it to the Letters to the Editor section at the New York Times.

"The following would be used only in response to media questions regarding PG&E credit exposure. Enron does not comment on specific credit exposures. We are confident we have established adequate reserves related to energy issues in California and regardless of what happens there we are also confident we will meet our 2001 (recurring) earnings per share estimate of $1.70-$1.75. (If pressed on the accuracy of the amount listed in PG&E's declaration) There are lots of numbers being tossed around for all parties that are owed money by PG&E. All of them are subject to to modification as information is corrected or updated. The numbers in PG&E's initial filing were estimates based on six month old PG&E data that may have been assembled very quickly. (If pressed on the amount in the creditor committee letter) Enron will not comment on specific credit exposures. We will not confirm or deny any such numbers rumored to be in confidential correspondence. Any number presented would need to be further examined relative to collateral, reserves and other credit offsets available under the circumstances. Again, we are very confident that no event related to this issue will prevent us from meeting our 2001 (recurring) earnings per share estimate of $1.70-$1.75.

Please, take a look at the information about a meeting last Sunday at Stanford University. The web site address is given below. My wife went to the presentation and told me it was quite critical about Enron. About 40 people attended. 2. I was approached by John Martin, a professor of finance at Baylor, to write jointly an academic paper on Enron for a financial journal. He wanted to work on an article on EBS. I have suggested a different topic: Enron - Case Study of a Company Reinventing Itself. I made a few points to John: a. Enron's evolution did not just happen by accident. It was a result of implementation of a far-reaching strategy developed by the management. b. In the process of its evolution Enron changed its environment. I came up with a term ""proactive evolution"", as opposed to ""reactive evolution."" c. The strategy included many elements, including emphasis on the quality of human resources, changing corporate attitudes to risk taking and employee empowerment. d. There are very few companies that match Enron's experience and accomplishemnts. The paper could become a standard reading at the MBA courses on corporate strategy and would help greatly our recruiting efforts.

August 9, 2000 Wall Street Journal 200 Liberty Street New York, NY 10281 Dear Editor: John Fialka and Rebecca Smith are to be congratulated for the first piece of journalism I am aware of that has attempted to explain what is really behind the energy problems in the overheated West (Deregulation Leaves Electricity Market Ripe for Manipulation by Power Firms, August 4). As this piece makes clear, these crises of capacity and delivery of electricity around the nation are doomed to continue for a simple reason: electricity is a new game, still being played under old rules. It is becoming a competitive market, but the old rules written for a government-sanctioned monopoly market haven't been updated. As a result, some old-line utilities are exploiting and even contributing to the crises with behavior that is not controlled by the old rules. As the story details, utilities can drive prices up, exacerbate the energy shortage by withholding electricity from the grid, or impede the free flow of electricity across lines they control. It's gamesmanship, very profitable and not illegal, but definitely not in the public interest. There is a very simple fix to the problem. Write new rules. Some old laws need to be repealed. Some new oversight over this interstate commodity has to be ",cynthia.sandherr@enron.com,mark.palmer@enron.com,"'Mark' : 'person', 'Bill Paxon' : 'person', '200 Liberty Street New York, NY 10281' : 'address', 'John Fialka' : 'person', 'Rebecca Smith' : 'person'",5,RE: letter to editor of Wall Street Journal,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,received,mark.palmer@enron.com

Specifically I think we should determine a fair market value for the PR we received from the event overall and I would like to transfer pay that amount from Corp to EBS. I know that sounds a little agressive but if you think about it the analysts are very focused on EBS's streaming revenue, which has been tough to come by.

"Mark: just a ""heads up"" that we may be called to react to this attached NYMERX press release since Enron added the provisions they oppose in the release. H.R. 4541 passed the House 377-4 last evening and Enron strongly supports the legislation (I will e-mail Ken Lay's letter to Chairman Combest which expresses our support plus some talking points for your information.) There is a real opportunity to enact this legislation this Congress. The last deal which needs to be cut is with Senator Gramm (he is the only obstacle to enactment in the Senate.) The ""Energy Provisions"" discussed in this press release are NOT IN PLAY and will not be changed in the Senate. It is other provisions which do not directly affect Enron which are being negotiated. Contrary to this release's statement, no House member (other than one member who didn't make it for the vote,Congressman Baker) is asking for changes in the Senate. The overwhelming numbers speak for themselves. All and all, this press release is outlandish. This will be our highest priority next week and changes occur by the hour. Please call if you do indeed get press calls and need our assistance. Many thanks.

"Mark: Although it's oftentimes difficult to quantify or establish a cause and effect relationship between PR and Enron's bottom line, the contributions that the PR Houston team made in mitigating the effects of the largest oil spill in Bolivia's history might be an exception to the rule. As you know, Transredes experienced two oil spills that were classified as crises: a 29 thousand barrel spill in January (Desaguadero) and a smaller one (Chorety) this past July. In both instances, PR staff from Houston were dispatched to Bolivia to develop an lead a crisis communication plan. The January crisis garnered enormous daily coverage and attention throughout the country and region. Under Dennis' leadership, an ambitious communication's plan was designed and implemented to mitigate the spill's repercussions in the international media and NGO community. The failure to manage expectations was critical considering we were also building the Cuiaba pipeline at the same time. During this period, the Enron Stcok price continued to grow from somewhere in the 50's to the 70's. Had the team failed to communicate effectively to all constituents, this could have adversely affected our brand and stock price--since the media and international NGO's were tracking our daily performance. The ability to engage, counsel and coordinate across the business groups and organizations had a significant result on our ability to execute our plan. Dennis was recognized by Shell, our partner in Transedres, for his leadership and personal commitment to the process during the January spill",keith.miceli@enron.com,mark.palmer@enron.com,"'Mark' : 'person', 'Dennis' : 'person', 'Dennis' : 'person'",3,Transredes Oil Spills: Possible PR Cases for your Wednesday Meeting,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,received,mark.palmer@enron.com

"Mark: Although it's oftentimes difficult to quantify or establish a cause and effect relationship between PR and Enron's bottom line, the contributions that the PR Houston team made in mitigating the effects of the largest oil spill in Bolivia's history might be an exception to the rule. As you know, Transredes experienced two oil spills that were classified as crises: a 29 thousand barrel spill in January (Desaguadero) and a smaller one (Chorety) this past July. In both instances, PR staff from Houston were dispatched to Bolivia to develop an lead a crisis communication plan. The January crisis garnered enormous daily coverage and attention throughout the country and region. Under Dennis' leadership, an ambitious communication's plan was designed and implemented to mitigate the spill's repercussions in the international media and NGO community. The failure to manage expectations was critical considering we were also building the Cuiaba pipeline at the same time. During this period, the Enron Stcok price continued to grow from somewhere in the 50's to the 70's. Had the team failed to communicate effectively to all constituents, this could have adversely affected our brand and stock price--since the media and international NGO's were tracking our daily performance. The ability to engage, counsel and coordinate across the business groups and organizations had a significant result on our ability to execute our plan. Dennis was recognized by Shell, our partner in Transedres, for his leadership and personal commitment to the process during the January spill",keith.miceli@enron.com,mark.palmer@enron.com,"'Mark' : 'person', 'Dennis' : 'person', 'Dennis' : 'person'",3,Transredes Oil Spills: Possible PR Cases for your Wednesday Meeting,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,received,mark.palmer@enron.com
