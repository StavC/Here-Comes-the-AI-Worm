"Bill, I will be happy to follow up on this. But I think we at least need to consider the ramifications of entering into brokerage agreements with brokers who accept non-cash credit from their customers. If they are willing to offer credit to Enron, they are bound to do so with others. Enron's funds/accounts will be pooled with all other customers in the event of a financial crisis at the broker. To the extent the broker has granted credit to unworthy trading partners, Enron could have exposure if those partners default, thus causing this financial distress at the broker. I don't wish to overblow this concern (i.e., focus excessively on low probability events), but I think we should at least discuss it a few minutes before we proceed.

"Sara, I think we need to explain the collateral transfer provision to Rose. I don't think she understands what the $0 transfer amount means.We do not want to wait until we have $500,000 of exposure to Global. We are happy to exchange collateral in $250,000 increments. So if Global owes Enron $1, we want the first $250,000 in collateral. If Enron owes Global $1, we are willing to post the first $250,000. The reality is that we will not call if the exposure is immaterial. It's not worth our time. But since we are already taking intra day credit risk, we have no desire to add another $500,000 to that exposure. As far as the cross default goes, we see it as a matter of proportion. Enron has $53 Billion in assets: Moore has $1.3 Billion. Accordingly, a default of $100 Million would have substantially different implications for each of these entities. So to say that they have been willing to go as high as 2 to 1 puzzles me. I don't really know what the basis for that ratio is. Anyway, we will no doubt have to talk through these issues with the counterparty. I am ready when you are.

"The New York office has been speaking to Credit Suisse First Boston for roughly 6 months about a producer hedging deal that is part of a strucutured deal they're putting together. It now looks as if it will get done in the next 3 weeks-1 month so we want to get all the necessary credit issues taken care of. In brief, the deal is a fixed price one, basis TCO (67% of the volumes) and CNG (33%) with a fixed price Nymex component as well. It will settle against the Inside FERC indices for both locations. The term of the deal is from December, 2000 to December 2012. The volumes decline throughout the term from roughly 22,000 mmBtu/d to 13,000 mmBtu/d. The average daily nominal volume is 17,000 mmBtu/d. As I understand it, these volumes are about 65% of the producers' total volumes. I've attached a spreadsheet to this message with more details. There are a couple of contractual and credit issues that CSFB wants to clarify. First, there is a question of the monthly cash settlement. CSFB would like payment to take place on the fifteenth of the month following the date both the floating and fixed prices are known. As I understand it, for the December settlement, which would be known in early December, cash payment would take place on February 15, 2000.

I will inform the ENA commercial team that they will need to allocate the total available line with ECTRIC. I believe separate masters with separate credit thresholds will be required. Though I would appreciate input from legal if we can somehow net Vitol S.A. (Swiss) with its US unit, Vitol S.A. Inc. under one master and thus set only one, global limit without the need to allocate.
