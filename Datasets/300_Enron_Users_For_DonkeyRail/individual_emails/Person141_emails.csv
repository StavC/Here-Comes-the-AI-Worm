"I have not personally talked to James about these issues in Enpower. His concerns regarding swaptions and asian options are accurate. IT is currently working on new volatility curves for swaptions to use. IT is also working on correlations in order for asian options to be valued properly. London trades many more swaptions and asian options than the US; therefore, the impact of not having swaption volatility curves and correlations is greater to them. The majority of options in the U.S. are European monthly and daily exercises and the current volatility curves adequately take care of these deals. The idea of swaption volatility curves has floated around in the US, but other more material items always got in the way and we continue to use the deal specific volatilities for the swaptions we do have. Once the technology is in place to use swaption volatilities we will also adopt. The system was originally built to handle the physical power world that existed in the US and as new markets and new ideas (such as the US becoming more and more of a financial market) we will need to enhance Enpower to follow suit. Swaption vols and asian options are two of these enhancements. Also, it is difficult to get option data out of Enpower. We have in stage an option sensitivity matrix that, once implemented into production. I will be sure that James knows about. It probably will not solve all his problems, but it will give him a starting place. Stacey Enron North America Corp.

"Yes, this is as of 2/28/01. I've run into another problem. The physical swaps on the West desk for 7.1MM is income. Per my conversation with Kori, she said that this was a swap with Cross Commodity book. If that is the case, the Cross commodity book has income of 8,738,809 that she says is related to this 7.1 deal. Unfortunately, I can't have income on both books. Is there an offset somewhere that I am not seeing. Which book should be taking the expense West or Cross Commodity? If I'm unable to get this straighten out by tomorrow morning, I will have to make an accrual of about 15MM on the cross commodity book. Which will need to be explained in further detail.

"Hi Stacey ! Thank You for the report and for visiting us ! The old office is still vacant and we are paying. I proposed today for Neil Austin/London and Thorstein Jenssen/Oslo that we should take an other property consultant to carry the task beside Healey&Baker. Our landlord at the new premises is Regus (www.regus.com). This arrangement is fine and easy to leave. We are staying here for 1-2 years, then apartment type or Oslo/London. Some minor notes to Your very good draft. Ms Heidi Sieppi moved to Oslo today June 6th 2001 to work there for 6 months. Yes, Regus Offices. Small cameras is a very good idea ! (< 100 $ each in Finland) To office profile I would like to add: Helsinki office's one task is to recruit from Finland for Enron. On the business control side: On our expense claims are travelling and minor marketing expenses Sincerely, Juhani -----Original Message----- From: White, Stacey Sent: 04 June 2001 18:02 To: Aalto, Juhani Subject: Status of the Old Office Juhani, Please see the attached Preliminary Finland Doorstep Review.
