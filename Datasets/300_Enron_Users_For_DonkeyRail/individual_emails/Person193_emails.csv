"Sharad As expected we didn't get time to discuss in detail what to do in Houston. We have discussed the subject informally, but I'm laying it out here for clarity, and for Vince/Stinson's information. Here are my thoughts: 1. Exotica. This is the top priority, as you'd rightly identified yourself. a. Learn how to build xlls. b. Catalogue functions in Houston Exotica not yet available in London. c. Catalogue differences between inputs to London and Houston Exotica functions. d. Produce London xll that allows current function calls to be used where possible, and incorporates new functions. e. Update documentation as appropriate. If you do nothing else in your two weeks, I'll be very happy with this. Main contacts are Paulo and Zimin. 2. Understand American Monte Carlo (AMC). The aim is to get a feel for AMC's characteristics. Before we embark on the use of AMC for real option valuation, I'd like to understand how it behaves for financial options. I suggest something like the following: a. Produce AMC code for single GBM for American option. Compare Greeks against those from appropriate tree methods. b. Two GBM spread option model, to compare against 1-d numerical integration method. Although the ""American"" bit of AMC isn't going to be used here, it will be interesting to think about the bucketing issue in price/payoff space and, again, the Greeks. c. Some form of mean reverting model, preferably two factor. d.

"Hi Vince Following our PRC meeting yesterday, here are the high-level facts as I presented them: Ben Parsons, overall: satisfactory. Good interpersonal skills, we have questions on his quant abilities. Reluctant to discuss/share his modelling work, and that which I have seen has too many hand fixes to give me confidence in his rigour. Other EnronCredit.com feedback indicates that he is sometimes prepared to compromise quant analysis to keep the traders happy. Matthew Williams, overall: excellent. Superior quant skills, excellent everywhere else. Recommended for promotion to Senior Specialist. Kirstee Hewitt, overall: excellent. A solid all-round performance, and a huge workload. In recognition of the level of responsibility Kirstee is bearing I'm recommending her for promotion to Senior Specialist. Sharad Agnihotri, overall: excellent. Superior quant skills, excellent everywhere else. Very self-directed and commercial-minded. Already operating at manager level in my opinion. Flagged for promotion next mid-year if performance continues at this level. Slava Danilov, overall: excellent. Superior quant skills, excellent everywhere else. As a non-commercial-type quant he is hard to fault, but will probably never work on a trading desk. Already operating at manager level in terms of his depth and rigour of analysis, and the extent to which he is contributing to the team.

"Hi Vince I'd originally been told you wouldn't be back until Wednesday, and so have another meeting booked for 4:30pm (London time) today. I really need to speak with you about the situation here in London re Anjam. To be blunt, Sharad, Kirstee and I have all been tempted to just walk out of the office until Anjam is removed. The major problems are: 1. I have no authority to demand Anjam should cooperate with Sharad, Kirstee etc. on their work. He does his best to impede their work, and I have no ability to access his drives for data/spreadsheets. 2. Anjam removes me from the cc lists in reply to all emails received by him, in an attempt to remove me from the loop. 3. Anjam continues to ""do business"", and people in London still think he's head of Research. 4. Pending your ""announcement"", people will continue to go to Anjam, and the business will remain dependent on him. 5. We're severely under-resourced. I'm still awaiting your review of the email I drafted for John S, requesting additional resource. I can't make a big recruitment drive until I have the authority to hire more. I honestly feel I can't do my job, and I'm currently asking myself what I'm even doing here. Notwithstanding the above, here is the current picture with our projects: Steve 1.

"All Attached in the latest version of my real options presentation, which I'll be presenting at a Real Options Group conference in Cambridge next month. I've removed the gas storage pricing example, and instead put in a simple example to show that my method can reproduce decision tree approaches (should one wish to do so). This is a response to the heavily decision-tree dominated approach taken by most people at the last conference I spoke at. I want to demonstrate explicitly that my approach covers both decision tree and option pricing as special cases, the synthesis needed for correct real option valuation. My presentation now covers: 1. Decision trees. 2. Binomial option pricing trees. 3. Power station valuation. 4. Power asset development. The option pricing and power examples are based on the (too simplistic) binomial tree method.

"Sharad As expected we didn't get time to discuss in detail what to do in Houston. We have discussed the subject informally, but I'm laying it out here for clarity, and for Vince/Stinson's information. Here are my thoughts: 1. Exotica. This is the top priority, as you'd rightly identified yourself. a. Learn how to build xlls. b. Catalogue functions in Houston Exotica not yet available in London. c. Catalogue differences between inputs to London and Houston Exotica functions. d. Produce London xll that allows current function calls to be used where possible, and incorporates new functions. e. Update documentation as appropriate. If you do nothing else in your two weeks, I'll be very happy with this. Main contacts are Paulo and Zimin. 2. Understand American Monte Carlo (AMC). The aim is to get a feel for AMC's characteristics. Before we embark on the use of AMC for real option valuation, I'd like to understand how it behaves for financial options. I suggest something like the following: a. Produce AMC code for single GBM for American option. Compare Greeks against those from appropriate tree methods. b. Two GBM spread option model, to compare against 1-d numerical integration method. Although the ""American"" bit of AMC isn't going to be used here, it will be interesting to think about the bucketing issue in price/payoff space and, again, the Greeks. c.

"Thanks for the comments Grant. The presentation is for a couple of external conferences that Vince volunteered me for - Vince has OK'd the content, and Stinson raised exactly the same issues as you. Unfortunately I just don't seem to be getting any response from RISK whatsoever on the publication of my article, so these conferences will be the public debut for my real options notation. Of course the discounting/risk neutrality thing is where the real judgement sits. When questions arise I'll take the line that while Research formulates the models using appropriate derivatives/market based valuation methods, we work with our RAC group which considers the discounting to be associated with various risks, and chooses these rates appropriately. The notation makes clear which uncertainties we are exposed to at different stages of the deals, which assists in choosing the rates. In practice I'm not yet at the stage where originators are using my notation yet - another reason I can't say too much about its actual use at the conference. I'm producing various tools for deterministic hydro optimization, GBM swing option valuation, and deterministic DP optimization for genset dispatch which people want right now - I'm working in the background on the kind of modelling my notation demands. People are getting to know me as a guy who can solve their immediate problems, and they'll be more likely to listen when I start rolling out the ""proper"" options-based models. My notation is currently used only in the specs I'm writing for",steven.leppard@enron.com,grant.masson@enron.com,"'Grant' : 'person', 'Vince' : 'person', 'Vince' : 'person', 'Stinson' : 'person'",4,Re: Real options presentation,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,sent,steven.leppard@enron.com
"Hi guys I need some advice. Sharad is in the process of finding differences between your and our versions of Exotica. At some point we will need to migrate London office over to your more up-to-date version, and I'm concerned that there may be RAC-style implications. I'm in favour of using the IT testers to carry out formal regression testing, and they are apparently able to do this.

The deadline for submission has been extended until tomorrow (Friday), so there's less of a hurry. As regard our summer visits, we'll need to speak to Dale over the budget. Personal commitments mean it's difficult for me to take two whole months to visit, so if the cost is prohibitive I may need to make just one shorter visit. I'd obviously like to spend longer, and two visits seems to be the only way I can do it. I believe the situation is similar for Kirstee. I've persuaded Richard to pay for Matt's visit in its entirety, and I've no doubt that RAC/Credit Trading will pick up the bills for Ben and Kirstee. It's difficult to think who'd be the natural group to pay for me. I honestly think I'll have difficulty persuading, e.g. Richard, that it's worth his while to pay for my visit.
