"New Mexico Train De-railment - Most of this week was spent helping customers re-route gas as the train derailment on TW's right-of-way in McKinley County, New Mexico forced Operations to blow down the mainline in the east of Thoreau area. The accident reduced flow to the California border by 250,000 MMBtu/d or 25%. Once the 27 rail cars were removed, a determination was made that line would need to be hydro-tested to ensure no damage had occurred. Approximately 2000 feet of pipe was excavated, the coating inspected and/or replaced, and if test results are good, the line should be back in service sometime during the weekend of November 3. While the pipe is being recoated, the line segment will only operate at 80% of maximum pressure. TW costs and revenue losses are being tracked to enable us to recoup damages from Burlington and/or Enron business interruption insurance. Sempra Trading - The loss of gas supply from TW's east end enabled us to sell a max rate IT agreement for 100,000 MMBtu/d to Sempra during this outage. Duke also moved 40,000 MMBtu/d of alternate volume west at max rates. Transport Options Tariff - The deadline to file protests on TW's Transport Options Program was Monday October 30. Twenty-two parties filed interventions, of which only three were protests: PG&E, SoCal/Sempra, and Dynegy. We expect FERC to schedule a technical conference sometime in the next 30 days.

"Southwest Gas - SWG informed us this week they will most likely not be ready to receive gas from TW by the projected November 1 in-service date; the new date will probably be mid-month. We will still invoice SWG for transportation under their firm contract beginning Nov. 1. Also, upon inspection this week, TW engineering noticed SWG had installed a bypass-valve on their meter station at the new facility. This bypass was not in the originally approved drawings. TW's policy does not allow for a bypass unless the customer has a non-interruptible contract. We are waiting for an explanation from SWG and will likely ask them to remove the extra pipe. Transport Options Program - A meeting to brief FERC Staff about the program was held in Washington this week. Overall, the filing received a very positive response.

"Cal Border backhaul - Operational linepack, slightly reduced demand at the Cal border, and California LDC's returning imbalance gas, all combined to create an excess gas inventory position at the border for TW. We then received a shipper request to backhaul some volume to SouthWest Gas at Las Vegas. The inventory position necessitated that TW sell some of the gas for the backhaul and we negotiated a PG&E based index price. Economics were as follows: 12/18/00 11,500 MMBtu @ $13.18 = $151,570 12/19/00 6,855 MMBtu @ $14.595 = $100,049 Transport 23,000 @ .15 = $ 3,450 Park N Ride 4,645 x $.20 x 2 = $ 1,858 Total $256,927 PNM Park n Ride - Burlington Resources has had difficulty delivering all their gas into San Juan that they nominated this week.

Late Tuesday morning PNM called asking about Park N Ride capability on TW. We negotiated a $.45 rate for 20,000 MMBtu for one day ($9,000). Because the rate was above max, we had to file the deal with FERC.

"Sun Devil Project El Paso Full Requirements contracts - this debate was stricken from FERC's agenda again this week (for the 3rd time) indicating dissent among Commissioners on how best to settle the allocation of El Paso's system serving Arizona and California markets. We may see a draft allocation order circulated prior to the next FERC meeting on 3/14. Az Public Service - Conference call was held 2/28 to discuss the latest proposal. APS remains hesitant to make any project commitment until they have a clearer direction from FERC on their EP full requirements contract. APS is forwarding to TW their likely operating scenarios for the 2000 Mw Red Hawk plant so we can draft an SFV rate design. The Arizona Corporation Commission granted permit approval this week to a new 1000 Mw gas-fired power plant in southeast Arizona. The new Bowie plant sits on the El Paso south system and is slated to be on-line in 2004. The new plant will only add to the capacity pressure on El Paso. Panda Energy - credit discussions were held outlining the provisions ETS would like to see from Panda to support a transport agreement. Panda is forwarding to us the cash waterfall language from their debt agreements that puts the fuel supply (including transport) and electric transmission payments ahead of all others (including bondholders).

"PNM - The FERC accepted TW's new tariff filing for purchasing capacity on PNM's Blanco to Rio Puerco line!!!

They would like to offset the balance owed TW against volume NNG owes El Paso. Market Services is verifying the net volume figures.

"Phil-- Enron is currently evaluating the possibility of installing an NGL peaking facility with appurtenant storage and rail facilities near Needles, California. Ideally, the plant would inject / vaporize normal butane at the rate of 18,750 gallons per hour into a high pressure natural gas transmission system. Current gas pipeline specs are as follows: Operating pressure - 850 - 1000 psig, worst case 750, normal range 800-900 Gas Volume - 650,000 - 750,000 MMBtu/day Expected normal butane (GPA spec) requirement - 450,000 gallons/day (18,750 gal/ per hour) My questions are: 1) Is anyone currently using butanes for peaking service and if so, where? 2) Do we need to blend with air (how much) or can we inject straight normal butane? 3) At what line pressure point do the butanes re-liquefy further downstream of the injection point as the pipeline pressure falls? 4) Is this peaking plant configuration feasible and if so, at what price (ball park here, don't go way out of your way)? (If it's not, what would your suggestion be for a design). I will fax you the normal butane specs as soon as I get them (please email back your fax number). As always, we're on a pretty tight time frame. After you've had a chance to review the above, I'd like to get together and discuss this with you.

"El Paso Blanco Mis-Measurement - The 518,000 MMBtu of gas agreed upon in our settlement letter with El Paso has been paid back to TW as of October 25. Southwest Gas - SWG agreed to amend the start date of their transport contract to November 15. TW resold the space along with an additional 1000 MMBtu/d for a total of 15,000 MMBtu/d to Sempra Energy at $0.15 (slightly above market but equal to the rate SWG was originally paying). Morgan Gottsponer sold Sempra the gas for this transport deal. Burlington Resources' Val Verde Plant - We held another conference call with BR this week to finally resolve the outstanding issue of TW's obligation to take 250,000 MMBtu/d from Burlington's Val Verde plant. Operational restrictions and San Juan temperatures seasonally affect the amount of volume TW is capable of receiving from Val Verde. BR had claimed damages of nearly $3,000,000 from having to sell San Juan gas into less attractive markets because TW could not take all their volume. Upon investigation, there were actually very few days in which TW hampered Burlington's deliveries; but TW does have an exposure here for a contractual commitment that operationally we cannot meet on a year-round basis without spending several million dollars for additional compression. In exchange for Burlington signing an amended operating agreement that meets both parties needs, TW has agreed to refund $100,000 of transport charges to BR for gas they moved this summer down the San Juan lateral.

Earlier today, i could have paid TW $4.00/mmbtu transport, got any FT? $10.50 at the border, $5.50 at TW. Makes your FT west shippers rich.

TIMOTHY LEARY: Because that's the only trip the establishment would let it take. SADDAM HUSSEIN: This was an unprovoked act of rebellion. We were justified in dropping 50 tons of nerve gas on it. RONALD REAGAN: I forgot. HIPPOCRATES: Because of an excess of phlegm in its pancreas. ANDERSEN CONSULTING: Deregulation of the chicken's side of the road was a threatening dominant market position. The chicken was faced with significant challenges to create and develop the competencies required for the newly competitive market. Andersen Consulting, in a partnering relationship with the client, helped the chicken by rethinking its physical distribution strategy and implementation processes. Using the Poultry Integration Model(PIM), Andersen helped the chicken use its skills, methodologies, knowledge, capital and experiences to align the chicken's people, processes and technology in support of its overall strategy within a Program Management framework.

We have scheduled to do this T= hursday, Aug. 30th, at 08:00hrs.

The best case senario is that the check will be of the type that we = can just pull the top, remove the clapper, replace top gasket and top, and = put back in service. This will require another short outage as we can not h= ave the parts on hand until we determine the type of check valve.

"This is in response to our meeting of April-10-2001 in Midland with Agave. Assuming units #761 and #762 are now assigned to LEC-10"" service, the below schematic is showing the capacity of the three remaining units #822, #842 and #845 at Atoka-3. At suction pressure of 225 psig and discharge pressure of 560 psig the capacity is 36 mmcf/d. The 36 mmcf/d is not a fixed capacity, if discharge pressure increases the capacity decreases. Basically it depends on the volume activities between Atoka-3 and Atoka-1 such as BP, Rio Pecos and GPM. Please pass this on to Agave.

The work order was generated with this amount so that the R-O-W folks would intiate a Landowner notification letter ASAP. EOG estimated a 5 - 15 mmcfd volume and they were to supply all materials to re-activate this point. A scope change was intiated and we were to supply the EFM for their meter tube, a verbal cost estimate to Bob in the amount of $35,000 was relayed. A third scope change raised the volume estimate to over 20 mmcfd, which normally means we install additional instrumentation. Operations at this time insisted we add the needed equipment to the work order. The E&C folks then put out the tighter cost estimate of $422,000. This included the following cost revisions: Chromatograph $55,000 H2O Monitor $10,000 H2S Monitor $35,000 EFM $35,000 Flow control $34,000 Positive shut-in $22,000 Flow bypass $12,000 Engi.
