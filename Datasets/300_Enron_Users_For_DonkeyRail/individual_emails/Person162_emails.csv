"Mike: It seems to me that we can proceed one of 2 ways. Those alternatives are as follows: 1. We could write a letter to Texaco and demand payment for the withheld amount. 2. If we are paying them this month, we could withhold the $1.5 million from the amount we are paying them. Of course, we would need to provide them some sort of explanation. My preference at this time would be to do the first item. If you could have someone provide me with the details of the transaction they withheld the money on I could draft the letter.

He did indicate that his original evaluation did not include abandonment costs in the figure he gave me over lunch several weeks ago. He is posturing toward the lower end of the range. However, he did indicate that $14 MM appeared to be minimum type valuation. Given that Duke's price for the pipeline is still in the range Enron that will consider selling the pipeline, would you please begin drafting the purchase sale agreement and the necessary assignments for the transaction. Attached herewith is a document that you reviewed last week regarding the schedule and structure for the transaction.

"jeff, will you fax to him. talk to weil and expect them to back down. thanks -----Original Message----- From: ""Rick Antonoff"" <Rick.Antonoff@cwt.com>@ENRON Sent: Thursday, October 18, 2001 7:13 PM To: Mellencamp, Lisa Cc: David Mitchell Subject: Bethlehem Steel I was able to obtain copies of the petition, utility order and other pleadings in the Bethlehem case via the court's internet site. I would like to see the contract(s) that ENA has with Bethlehem to determine whether there is any basis to deem ENA a utility for purposes of section 366. For our conflicts check, I need to know which Bethlehem company(ies) the ENA contract is with. As far as I see in the motion, only ENA is listed as a utility. Interestingly, in the motion, the debtor states: ""Nothing contained herein shall constitute an admission by the Debtors that a listed entity is a utility entitled to the protections afforded by section 366 or any other provision of the Bankruptcy Code."" Indeed. Nevertheless, for the time being, the order does prohibit the ""Utility Companies,"" which definition includes ENA, from altering, refusing or discontinuing service to, or discriminating against, the Debtors. While arguably ambiguous as to whether ENA is rendering a service or whether closing out the contract is discrimination, prudence dictates complying with the order until we get it changed.

While it is not a problem to spread the total volume ratably across the four locations, the Force Majeure language in past contracts has put the desk at risk during certain events which would allow the Counterparty to cut supply. For example, in August when the hurricane presented a Force Majeure event, Chase cut gas supply to ENA, but ENA was unable to cut an equivalent amount of supply to Chase due to language in the contract. As a result, the physical desk was forced to bear the cost of delivering more supply than it received.

"I know there's a lot of anxiety about severance, reflecting the possibility that the existing Enron severance plan might be changed. I noticed in the merger agreement that a ""floor"" was set on severance. Have you heard anything about what Dynegy has for severance? I know there are exceptions, but I was just curious, as lots of folks are very nervous. From the merger agreement: From and after the Effective Time, Enron employees, excluding those covered by collective bargaining agreements, will be provided severance benefits that are at least comparable in all respects to the severance benefits provided by Dynegy under its severance benefit plans and arrangements for similarly situated employees. For purposes of the foregoing obligation regarding severance, the term ""severance benefit plans and arrangements"" shall not include any individually negotiated agreements. The foregoing notwithstanding, nothing in this Section 7.16 shall obligate Dynegy to provide severance benefits if an employee is offered a comparable position, benefits and salary with a third-party purchaser of the business operation in which the employee works without regard to the form of the third-party purchase",kay.mann@enron.com,t..hodge@enron.com,"'I' : 'person', 'I' : 'person', 'I' : 'person', 'I' : 'person', 'employee' : 'person', 'employee' : 'person'",6,from the merger agreement,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,received,t..hodge@enron.com
