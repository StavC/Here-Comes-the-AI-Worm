"Hey Eva, Sorry for the delay, but it has been absolutely nuts lately. I think the smallest move we have had in the last 2 weeks was 30 cents. Not to mention 8 of the days were close to or more than $1.00. Luckily, most of us have been on the right side through all this. And lest I forget about basis. Demarc, Vent, Chicago all up 70 cents. And PEPL basis trading as high as plus 25 cents. Anyway, I am taking a much deserved vacation. I will be flying to Boston tomorrow and coming back on Christmas. I am looking forward to just hanging out with the family and spending time with my nephew. Let me know if you are going to be in Boston during this time. My cell phone number is 713-306-0760. On a completely different note, we finally got your postcard from Peru. Sorry to hear about the backpack fiasco, but it sounds like you had an incredible. time.

"Andy, The scale effect in the transport model can be explained. I use a European option to do the illustration. I raise the underlying and strike price by the same amount, use the fuel percentage to adjust the strike. The net result is the intrinsic value decreases as the level goes up. If the fuel percentage is not very high, the option premium actually increases with the level, although the intrinsic value decreases. If the fuel percentage is very high (>8%), then we see a decreasing option price. In the transport deal, fuel change is often below 5%, so you will not see a decreasing spread option price when NYMEX moves up. So I think the transport model still does what it should do. Zimin In the following exmaple, I used r=6%, vol=20%, T=100days, see spreadsheet for details. ---------------------- Forwarded by Zimin Lu/HOU/ECT on 10/20/2000 01:24 PM --------------------------- Zimin Lu 10/20/2000 10:45 AM To: Andrew H Lewis/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: Colleen Sullivan/HOU/ECT@ECT, Stinson Gibner/HOU/ECT@ECT Subject: level effect in transport Andy, The following spread sheet domenstrates the leve effect in transport valuation. I add an ""NYMEX add-on"" to both delivery and receipt price curve before fuel adjustment, keep everything else the same.

"Andy, The scale effect in the transport model can be explained. I use a European option to do the illustration. I raise the underlying and strike price by the same amount, use the fuel percentage to adjust the strike. The net result is the intrinsic value decreases as the level goes up. If the fuel percentage is not very high, the option premium actually increases with the level, although the intrinsic value decreases. If the fuel percentage is very high (>8%), then we see a decreasing option price. In the transport deal, fuel change is often below 5%, so you will not see a decreasing spread option price when NYMEX moves up. So I think the transport model still does what it should do.

"PGL is considering sending out RFPs to producers as part of their proposed fix-price lock-in. Specifically, what they are looking at is Nov-Mar fix price Harper purchases that they would then flip to ENA as part of the supply deal. We should discuss a couple of things before PGL starts this process: 1. How much Harper gas can PGL purchase for Nov-Mar? I assume that all of the May-Oct '01 has already been purchased by ENA. 2. What is the basis conversion amount to take fix price Harper and turn it into fix price Chicago? 3. Should we encourage or discourage these producer lock-ins? (i.e. do these deals remove a short Harper basis position that ENA doesn't want?) I'm not sure if PGL is really going to do this, but Raulie would love to get back in the gas buying business. Let me know when we can get together to discuss.
