"Attached is a list of parties the Cal ISO has identified in an earlier report that had ""overcharged"" the market from May - Nov 2000 (the filing was mistakenly put into the FERC docket room). EES is listed as party B8 with $27.9 MM as Excessive Rents. The biggest overcharger was BC Powerex with $176.2 MM.

"Dan Watkiss argues that FERC has no authority to override the state, even though the rules go far beyond what is critical or necessary. Per Christi's thoughts, we may want to gauge Congressional interest in pushing something as an add-on to EPAct '92 that allows only safety / public interest reasons for an EWG to be restricted in its siting by a State.

The Florida issue seems similar to California (or any other state that has idiosyncratic siting issues) in that FERC has encouraged California to speed the siting of generation, but has not ordered it. What I am not sure about is whether the possible DOE or Congressional emergency electricity legislation that Jim sent out yesterday (on demand side management payments) could also include language that would allow the federal government to override the certain state generation siting issues, such as the Florida law. ---------------------- Forwarded by Christi L Nicolay/HOU/ECT on 04/19/2001 08:59 AM --------------------------- ""Dan Watkiss"" <dwatkiss@bracepatt.com> on 04/19/2001 08:15:45 AM To: <Christi.L.Nicolay@enron.com> ",james.steffes@enron.com,steven.kean@enron.com,"'Dan Watkiss' : 'person', 'James D Steffes' : 'person', 'Christi L Nicolay' : 'person', 'Marchris Robinson' : 'person', 'James D Steffes' : 'person', 'Christi L Nicolay' : 'person', 'Dan Watkiss' : 'person', 'dwatkiss@bracepatt.com' : 'email'",8,Re: FLORIDA Matters,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,sent,james.steffes@enron.com

"As we begin to meet with FERC Staff on the Wholesale market issues related to CA problems, I think that we need to put together a list of questions that FERC needs to be asking Western power market participants. The following are some questions that I think are important to have FERC ask; I'm sure there are more. 1. Were California utilities underscheduling load into the PX day ahead market? 2. How many MWs did the CA ISO procure during each hour during the Summer 2000? How does this compare with CA ISO procurement during 1999? 3. Has PG&E changed its bidding behavior associated with its Hydro facilities in 2000? 3. Are there baseload facilities that were operated differently in 2000 than in 1999? 4. Were any generation plants off-line due to unplanned maintenance during Summer 2000? 5. How did the CA ISO demand side program work? Why didn't more load participate? 6. What options did SDG&E have to ""hedge"" its retail rates? What were prices in the CAL PX block forward market on Jan 15, 2000 and May 15, 2000? 7. How high did natural gas prices go in California for generation during Summer 2000? 8. Were other Western power markets prices higher (year-on-year)? 9. Did the CA ISO Board face political pressure to reduce bid caps? Is this appropriate for a FERC jurisdictional entity? 10. What specific details is SDG&E referring to in its Complaint on ""unworkably competitive"" CA ISO markets? Can these be fixed ""quickly""? Please add other questions.

"Jeff -- Some thoughts - 1. Your key assumption seems to be that this Summer the energy supply manager (CDWR buying net short of utility) has enough ""power"" to sell the negawatts. I am not so sure. I belive that a more realistic assumption is that in most hours this Summer, CDWR will be buying energy from the ISO. 2. If my assumption is closer to reality, than CDWR will not be able to sell ""excess"" MWs and pay the customer. Even if you are right, CDWR buys at $80/Mwh (LT contracts delivered today) and sells at $300/Mwh = net benefit to deliver to customer of $220/Mwh [unless you are saying the $80/Mwh goes to retail rates and $300/Mwh to customer = which is what I say in #3]. 3. I think that we should just call a spade a spade. CDWR should give the customer for a negawatt $300/Mwh independent of how they manage their portfolio. The $ should be put into the general expense of power and collected through CPUC approved rates. Had the customer consumed, that Mwh would have cost CDWR at least $300/Mwh (and probably more given the increased load). The state and/or customers still spends the same $. The only argument that one could have is that the customer who conserves ""costs"" other customers $. But these other customers should not feel slighted. Again, CDWR was already going to pay the generators. Why not pay someone who has a real business in CA? 4.

"In the attached article, there is reference to the state taking control of some Utility transmission asset as a quid pro quo for bailing out the Utilities (Senate President Pro Tem John Burton (D-San Francisco), who argues that California should take control of the transmission grid). While our understanding of the current politics is that many politicians don't want that trade, it is not out of the question. Having the state take over transmission would make all transmission non-jurisdictional to FERC within California. Given that the State really wants ""something"", does anyone have any ideas as to what these companies may have as a viable trade? One thought - I remember reading that PG&E NEG had taken out an option on 20,000 MW of turbines last year. Maybe the state could require PG&E NEG to sell (implicit deal) these turbines at cost to anyone siting in CA? I'd appreciate any other thoughts that people have. Not sure where this issue goes over time, but we need to help the politicians come up with a better answer than the transmission plant.

What do people thin about beginning to quietly discuss with members of the California state house that the damages of the summer are not (or don't need to) being charged to end use customers. The utilities are doing a really good job of wrapping themselves with little households. In fact, TURN signed on to this pleading.

"As I've been thinking about our response today, I would like Enron to focus on making sure that the California (WSCC) markets are as good a possible for business over the next 15 to 24 months. Following that idea, I think that the key points are (1) clarifying/raising the soft cap and (2) reducing the burden/risk of the prospective refund period. I know that we had discussed leading off with the debate over market power / retroactive refunds, but I think that (a) FERC is not inclined to do much more on this issue, (b) FERC wants to fix the market as much as it can given the current political realities, and (c) if retroactive refunds become an issue, we still have our full compliment of resources to later fight this fight. I would recommend that the pleading and Alan's testimony be modified to bring these issues to the top of the ticket. We should still include all of our other arguments. Finally, I want to make sure that Enron is taking the right position by quietly supporting a $250/Mwh soft cap with safe harbor fixes? Sue Mara, can you please try and find out what EPSA, IEPCA, and WPTF are going to file? I want to make sure that we are in the ball park on this issue but not getting too soft.

"The attached note is from Enron's hired lobbyist in Sacramento. Looks like the only thing that is going to happen will be a Budget without anything on energy restructuring (could continue to change). There will be some additional negotiating on SBX2 78 over the recess. Enron is looking for a way into those discussions (Jeff Dasovich). We will try to push good language on DA dates and assignment of Utility and CDWR costs. On another note, CDWR has announced its revenue requirements going forward. The numbers are significantly less than had previously been expected (due to lower costs for spot market purchases). The end result, if their figures are correct, is that the March 27 3c/kwh increase would be sufficient going forward (we are trying to validate). The key is that now the Retained Generation proceedings will determine if any more $ is needed from retail customers.

"In the same Decision that the CPUC is considering voting out on suspending Direct Access, the CPUC is considering a SoCal Edison recommendation to suspend further payment of the Negative CTC to marketers. The Decision would find that the earlier Stipulation does not require SCE to make a cash payment in lieu of a bill credit (even though SCE has already paid cash in previous periods for the Negative CTC). The Decision orders SCE to not make cash payments to satisfy the Negative CTC credit. The Decision is unclear as to whether or not this is simply a suspension of payment or would be permanent. The Decision would apply the same findings and rulings to PG&E and SDG&E. The key issue is that rather than having a cash receivable, EES would now have a bill credit receivable. In addition, because EES re-sourced its customers, the Utility account that holds the bill credit is EES, not the customer account. The only method to obtain the economic value of the bill credit is to utilize the Utilities' services. Even if EES physically serves the customers going forward, it may not be the same account that has the bill credit. The outcome of this case would impact our current Complaint, but it is unclear exactly how the CPUC would apply this Decision to that case. We are intending to (a) try to remove this issue from the CPUC Decision, (b) trying to clarify the suspension is not meant as a vehicle to deny us payment, and (c) trying to ",james.steffes@enron.com,"steven.kean@enron.com, michael.tribolet@enron.com, wanda.curry@enron.com,

"Michael Tribolet held a conference call this evening to discuss Enron Wind's legal obligations given SCE's non-payment. In general, given the legal structure of Enron Wind, some action may be required from a partnership perspective. The key next step is action on SB47 - Interim Short-Term Avoided Cost Methodology. Enron Wind is unlikely to take any action if real progress is made by this Friday. If not, a different action plan will occur. This may change if other renewable QFs sue (for instance FP&L - who has retained counsel but don't want to be the first to take action). They will begin to draft some pleadings to prepare for legal action (in case this is necessary).

We've drafted a Stipulation for Enron and PJM that gets most of Enron on board that I'm happy to send to your lawyers, but I want to be realistic about its chances of success - a) appointment of a Settlement Judge (not Technical Staff) to oversee the consolidation process with quarterly updates and right to comment from all parties; b) PJM will agree to modify its system including 1) FTR system, 2) eliminate ICAP obligation, and 3) discussion about central market making functions (day ahead markets). c) a more specific obligation to move forward with the ability for Enron file at FERC on Nov.1.02 to repeal this status with PJM pre-approval on our filing (I went beyond the agreeing not to oppose such a filing). He agreed with me that PJM wouldn't be able to sign. We talked a little about a middle ground, but he and I did not see any real options. Given the time commitments for his lawyers, he is going to file something that would (a) agree to a Settlement Judge, (b) ask FERC not to predetermine any outcomes, especially a merger, and (c) don't hold his RTO hostage to our demands.

"Wednesday morning, June 27 (before the CPUC decision to delay the vote on DA), I gave Marty Sunde this view on exit fees and surcharges for DWR costs in the California market: There is a 75% probability that customers who go to direct access and who used utility service between January and June 2001 will pay an exit fee calculated as the difference between market price and utility rates during that period. The exit fee could also include the going forward costs or alternatively, those costs could be passed along in the form of a uniform surcharge. In other words, with regard to past costs, regulators or legislators would require DA customers to pay the amount they belive had been sucked from the state during the January-June crisis period. I said the ""retroactive ratemaking"" argument is a nicety that California could easily dispense with. Now that we know the CPUC decision will be delayed, I think the probability of exit fees for retroactive costs is even higher - either the DA legislation will pass between now and July 3, or Carl Wood will change the PUC order to get the ""jailbreaking"" customers to pay up.",harry.kingerski@enron.com,james.steffes@enron.com,"'Marty Sunde' : 'person', 'Carl Wood' : 'person'",2,View on Exit Fees,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,received,james.steffes@enron.com

Given that we are already well into the Summer of '01, it now appears that further CDWR contracting will only lock CA into high prices. The original idea was that CDWR could buy power at $80/mwh and ensure that retail rates wouldn't go higher. Neither of these concepts have held true. I think that Enron needs to consider actively oppossing any further contracting and a bond issuance in light of the potential harm that CDWR will do. First, the prices they are getting won't be great for customers. Second, with the ""new"" stranded costs that will be created, direct access in the future won't have a chance.

"I would have responded sooner, but I was on the 9:30 EWS conference call. I am planning to go. I'm pretty sure Jane Tholt, who trades El Paso on the West gas desk, will go. Suzanne Calcagno has also indicated an interest so she may go as well. Jane's major concern at this time is that El Paso doesn't mess with the pooling procedures. Their proposal calls for increasing the number of pools on the system from the current six to twenty, which the Desk feels would impair liquidity. I wouldn't look for a lot of progress at this conference. The EOC full-requirements customers are going to be howling about having their flexibility restricted in any way, and the other firm customers who have CD limits are going to howl about the full requirements customers having a secondary priority superior to theirs. This same proposal was on the table and they couldn't reach a compromise in six months of settlement conferences working with the chief FERC ADR person on the Amoco/Burlington complaint case. Our preference is with the CD customers' position, but if the full requirements customers don't get some kind of accommodation, they will never settle. Then if FERC rules against them, they will take it to the appeals court and maybe further. This is a BIG issue for them.

"Jim, I am not too familiar with the ISO program. I think they treat load curtailments as the equivalent of spinning reserve and pay as if it were spinning reserve? I don't know how participation-friendly the program is for SCs. I know that based on energy price signals we may at times try to agree with the customer to reduce the customers load so that we can resell the energy purchased for that customer.

"This story from today's Gas Daily doesn't help -- note the last sentence: ***Calif. gas and power prices: Joined at the hip? When gas reaches the California border, something happens to the price. The same goes for the power market. But how closely are the prices of gas and power linked? Over the past several months, it has become fashionable to declare that power prices and gas prices are dependent on one another, rising and falling in sync. In a recent FERC public meeting, for instance, transportation differentials were fingered as the main culprits for the cost of wholesale power in California (GD 4/27). At first glance, the evidence seems to support this point. From one perspective, it does appear that the two markets do indeed reach bottoms and ceilings at the same time. But on closer examination, power and gas prices over the last year were often out of sync -- even in California. When we view prices in major wholesale power markets relative to prices in major producing areas serving California, we also find little or no relationship, especially in terms of the magnitude of the change in price. For the last six months, the price of gas in California has generally stayed above the cost of gas in the major producing basins supplying gas to California. The resulting difference in price -- the basis between California gas and producing area gas -- most often exceeded the cost of transporting the gas to California severalfold. On Dec. 11, the cost of gas in California was about 10 times as great as the cost in every producing area from which it receives gas.

"Attached is a paper that was filed at the FERC by Paul Joskow and Ed Kahn. I assume it was attached to SCE's comments in the FERC price caps proceeding. This study appears to be the most definite analysis so far of the question: did market fundamentals or generator market power cause the price run-ups this summer? Joskow/Kahn conclude that although much of the run up was due to gas prices and NOx costs, that the market was unworkably competitive; i.e., the cost run ups do not fully explain the price run ups. Further, they provide what they claim is evidence that individual generators withheld this summer. Joskow/Kahn state: ""Moreover, there is considerable empirical evidence to support a presumption that the high prices experienced in the summer of 2000 were the product of deliberate actions on the part of generators or marketers controlling the dispatch of generating capacity to withhold supply and increase market prices."" Biggest withholders in their analysis are: AES/Williams, Reliant, and Dynegy Marketer/traders are largely but not completely spared criticism in their analysis. Joskow/Kahn recommend that FERC staff undertake a study of the entire WSCC data to ""Determine the role of marketers in the production and bidding behavior of the California generators."" and to find out more why CA imports fell. It will be interesting to see how the CA generators react to this study. My initial read is that this is will be received as an important, influential work.

"Great points. Teece---and the lion's share of the folks on the participants list---are advocates of a minimalist role for government, particularly where markets are a clear and preferably option, as in the case of electricity. That said, I think we're going to have to make a fundamental decision about what the goal of this ""study"" would be, which will determine, to a large degree, whether we choose to pursue it. I'll throw out for comment the notion that the study should be designed to serve one purpose: to influence the policy decision currently under debate ""To de-regulate or not."" As such, I wouldn't see issues like ""PJM or APX"" or ""competitive default supplier or not,"" or ""divest generation with vesting contracts or retain the assets"" being the focus. That debate over critically important implementation details, would seem to come in ""Round 2,"" once the initial debate over ""deregulate or not"" is won. To try to do both, i.e., resolve in the broad policy issue AND make the case for the specific, ""right"" implementation plan, would arguably bog the study down, perhaps interminably. And it seems that time is of the essence in the current environment. In addition, unless the fundamental policy issue is won--and won rather quickly--debating implementation may be moot. Of course, it will be impossible to avoid some level of dicussion on ""how to do it,"" but that would not be the emphasis.
