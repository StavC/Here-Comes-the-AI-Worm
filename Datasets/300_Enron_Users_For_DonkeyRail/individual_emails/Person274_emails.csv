"I recently met with John Sherriff to review year-to-date regulatory affairs costs. We both agreed my team's efforts represent a real bargain! Seriously, John asked me to summarise year-to-date spend for the commercial units, so that they might get a feel for the costs being incurred on their behalf. I do this below. First, just few explanations. First, these are figures through July (7 months). Our burn rate is fairly constant, so you should be able to extrapolate year-end spend from these, with the exception of Central and Southeastern Europe, which started high and has come down. Second, direct costs (payroll, travel, consultants, etc.) incurred by my department year-to-date are $2.27 million. Overhead allocations in (IT, Admin., HR, etc.), which are included in your figures below, represent $2.36 million. Finally, there is a little bit of ""noise"" still in these numbers, e.g., my cost centre, for some reason, is picking up a large share of all Amsterdam payroll costs, even though I only have one person in that office. The figures below are not intended to be all inclusive, and therefore will not necessarily add up $4.63 million. Please feel free to contact me should you have any questions.

"Just a short note. Below, Philip Davies reports on his conversation with the head of energy balancing at the Polish grid company. While this is only one person's view, it should be an informed view. And that view is that a balancing market, which should lead to trading, should be in place for 1 January 2001. Even discounting for optimism, 1 April does not seem unrealistic. There are still hard issues to be resolved regarding long-term PPAs and stranded costs, but given this informed, and bullish, view on when we might have a ""market"" in Poland, I wanted to provide you with this status report.

"Paul - I will ask you to take the lead in preparing a one or two page briefing paper for Steve in anticipation of his meeting with Energy Minister Hain. Plus, throw in the bio. Steve will obviously need to be aware of status of Isle of Grain, Rassau, Severnside, NETA, relevance (or lack thereof) of California to England and Wales model (on this last point, Anna Wlker has asked me to prepare two memos for DTI on i) US energy policy under Republicans, and ii) California situation, so the latter memo will be vetted by Washington DC office, and will subsume most of the substance of relevance of California to England and Wales). We should note that Hain is anti-nuclear (though he now denies it), very green, and thus, we will want Steve to at least talk about our views on climate change (which will paint us as not hewing to the typical US line), and why lagre-scale CCGT is not a bad thing (this is probably most important area, and one that will probably require some explanation for Steve, so he understands the context (irrational as it is) in which Hain is likely to see these types of projects. thanks mcs ---------------------- Forwarded by Mark Schroeder/LON/ECT on 27/01/2001 10:52 --------------------------- From: Steven J Kean@ENRON on 26/01/2001 14:21 CST Sent by: Maureen McVicker@ENRON To: Tom Briggs/NA/Enron@Enron cc: Mark Schroeder/LON/ECT@ECT Subject: Re: Minister hain Yes Steve Kean",mark.schroeder@enron.com,paul.dawson@enron.com,"'Paul' : 'person', 'Energy Minister Hain' : 'person', 'Anna Wlker' : 'person', 'Mark Schroeder' : 'person', 'Steven J Kean' : 'person', 'Maureen McVicker' : 'person', 'Tom Briggs' : 'person', 'Mark Schroeder' : 'person', 'Steve Kean' : 'person'",9,Re: Minister hain,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,sent,mark.schroeder@enron.com

"The UK has a new energy minister, Peter Hain. As you will see from the Electricity Association (UK)'s brief below, he should be regarded as much greener, more interventionist, and populist than his predecessor, Helen Liddell. Ralph Hodge, David Lewis, and I met with Peter Hain, when he was involved in Welsh development issues, to discuss our power project at Rassau in Wales, and found him very supportive of the UK government's stricter consents policy regarding gas-fired power generation, and not at all favourably disposed to projects of the size being proposed for Rassau, i.e., 1200 MW (he asked why we could not make it much smaller). Helen Liddell was scheduled to go to Washington DC in early February, and Hain may now be her replacement, in which case some of our US-based enron colleagues will have an opportunity to meet him. let me know if you need more. thanks mcs ---------------------- Forwarded by Mark Schroeder/LON/ECT on 25/01/2001 10:24 --------------------------- ""Neil Williams"" <Neil_Williams@electricity.org.uk> on 25/01/2001 10:12:44 To: <Angela.lawrence@24sevenNet.com>, <chris.anastasi@british-energy.com>, <jill.kent@british-energy.com>, <linda.smith@british-energy.com>, <peter.haslam@british-energy.com>, <peter.inglis@british-energy.com>, <robert.armour@british-energy.com>, <dburnell@csw.com>, ""Alison Heath"" <Ali",mark.schroeder@enron.com,"mark.frevert@enron.com, michael.brown@enron.com, tom.briggs@enron.com,

I know Peter supposedly has this marked in his diary for cancellation on the day it comes due, and you may well decide that that is the appropriate course of action, but at least wanted to pass this along, because I think any decision to cancel needs your objective evaluation, something I think is lacking in Peter's judgment (how you can decide to cancel without having seen the man's work, plus I do not think Peter appreciates/understands the value, nor the nuances, of the argument that you need a contracts market and retail competition, otherwise he would support this work, since it bears directly on the Acceleration Directives that he is supposed to be pushing in Brussels!).

"For those of us still working in markets that are either not fully liberalised, or where the incumbents still foment scepticism about liberalisation/deregulation, we are often hard pressed to be able to point to examples of benefits of liberalisation in markets other than in the ""Anglo-Saxon world"" (which somehow makes it inapposite to the French, the Germans, the Japanese, etc.).

Around 70 percent of Polish electricity, some 105-110 terawatt hours yearly, is now sold under long-term contracts at fixed prices above market rates. Their existence has effectively blocked market competition. Under the programme, which still needs to be approved by the entire cabinet, some 30 percent of the contracts are to be replaced by a compensation scheme by the end of the year, while the entire wholesale market is to be free for trade as of 2002.

"Greetings Mark: Here is the latest. ENA signed a short-term deal (5 -week term, I believe) with DWR that goes through the end of the month, at which time we have the option to extend the deal to a five-year term. We are discussing other longer-term deals, too. As Steve points out, we've had serious concerns regarding DWR's creditworthiness. (DWR, the Dept. of Water Resources, is the state agency that Davis made the purchaser of power when the utilities hit the financial skids a few months ago and the market stopped selling them power.) The problem has been simple and significant---while our brilliant Governor and Legislature gave DWR the authority to buy power on behalf of the cash-strapped utilities, they neglected to t spell out how DWR would recover its costs of buying the power. Based on comments from us and other suppliers regarding the creditworthiness issue, the California PUC issued an order last week establishing that 1) the PUC would indeed pass DWR's power costs through to ratepayers and 2) the PUC would NOT second-guess (i.e., impose ""reasonabless"" standards) on any contracts signed by DWR as a condition of passing the costs through to ratepayers. With the CPUC decision (and other language that ENA's negotiated into the DWR contract), ENA is close to being comfortable signing the 5-year deal, even in the face of the FERC order. That's predominantly due to the fact that the power price in the",jeff.dasovich@enron.com,mark.schroeder@enron.com,"'Mark' : 'person', 'ENA' : 'person', 'Steve' : 'person', 'Davis' : 'person', 'ENA' : 'person', 'ENA' : 'person'",6,Re: news/updates,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,received,mark.schroeder@enron.com

"Thanks, Mark. Of course in doing the Reuters telephone interview yesterday morning at Eva's request, for more than an hour, I made all of the critical/ explanatory points, and more, you mention below. The temptation of the quote from the Commission official was obviously irresistible for one of the journalists (Pomeroy) however. On the positive side, however, mention of traders' objections to level and incidence of the proposed tariff, its discriminatory effect, and absence of agreement about implementation in Germany are attributable to my briefing of the other journalist, Orgill. The quoted official is giving the Dominique Ristori (a Commission Energy Policy Director of French nationality) party line, but our ""victory"" is attributable to decisions taken in the Cabinet of Loyola de Palacio, the Energy Commissioner, with whom I intervened on behalf of EFET two weeks ago, and who had already been confronted in September by British government objections. As such, it no longer matters objectively what M. Ristori and his spokespersons think about the ""demise of the 2 euros"". As you and I discussed yesterday, we must now move on rapidly to offer an alternative traders/ system users' solution for establishment of non discriminatory cross border transmission tariffs. An EFET paper for this purpose is already in preparation, and I spoke to the Cabinet of Mario Monti (Competition Commissioner) about the principles involved on Wednesday evening this week.

Joe tells me that Investor Relations has received some inquiries about ""what is going on in Europe"" yesterday, due to the bad headline Reuters chose below (aided by a self-serving European Commission official), and Dynegy's Q3 earnings showing red ink for Europe. Ignoring the headline, and the quote from the European Commission civil servant (which I will elaborate upon below), this is a BIG WIN. It is progress for liberalisation, and I intend to tell The Economist just that when I do an interview with a reporter later today. This story is about the DEMISE of the ill-conceived 2Euros/MWh export charge. It stands truth and logic on its head to say, as the unnamed European official does, that the demise of the 2 euros charge was anything like ""harmonisation"" or that its demise sets back European liberalisattion. It is now much more likely that we will get a charging regime that will maintain or increase trade, and certainly will not set back trade as the 2 euros would have.

I'll pass it on to Mark Metts Mark Schroeder@ECT 12/18/2000 05:10 AM To: Steven J Kean/NA/Enron@Enron cc: Subject: water opportunity I meant to send you an article some time ago on the UK water business (now cannot find it). I do not make it my habit to follow this sector, and we have never discussed my following this here in the UK. However, I just wanted you to be aware, and you can pass along as you see fit, that recent developments in the UK water sector should create new business opportunities for Wessex (and, indeed, trade press here reports as much). I am also not trying to ""end run"" either Colin Skellett (CEO) or Keith Harris (reg. affaris at Wessex), both of whom I have a high regad for. just wanted to get this into the right circles. The development is the ""mutualisation"" of water distribution companies. This was proposed last year by Kelda, in England, and turned down by the water regulator. It is essentially securitising the future income streams of the pipes business, servicing bonds, and making the customers the owners (there is essentially no equity stake). Thus, the license obligation to invest in infrastructure is on the customers themselves (raises interesting enforcement problems). The ""services"" part of the business is ""outsourced"" on a competitive basis (this is where Wessex would come in). As I noted, such a proposal has previously been rejected. Now, though, it is proposed to ""mutualise",steven.kean@enron.com,mark.schroeder@enron.com,"'Mark Metts' : 'person', 'Mark Schroeder' : 'person', 'Steven J Kean' : 'person', 'Colin Skellett' : 'person', 'Keith Harris' : 'person'",5,Re: water opportunity,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,received,mark.schroeder@enron.com

"As to whether long term contracting by Cal. is a good idea, the answer is somewhat mixed. We were one of the early parties pointing out the problems with total reliance on the spot market and encouraging more forward contracting. Given the utilities' precarious financial position there were two options: 1) outsource the default provider obligation to the market (this is what we prefer but there was no political support for it), or 2) have the state put its credit behind the purchases. California is pursuing the latter, with CDWR prucahsing the utilities' requirements. In the short term, we have criticized the state's plan because it contemplates state takeover of the grid; state participation in power plant financing, construction, and ownership; and they have not made it clear that CDWR really has the money to pay for all the purchases. I am attaching text I have used as the base for a number of communications with policymakers.

"Mark -- Thanks for the additions. I will add to the Asset / Responsibility Matrix. The definition I have been using is that Regulatory Risk is a subset of Sovereign Risk (with the other element being Political Risk). Regulatory Risk is a ""legal"" action taken by a government or its agent which modifies Enron's business environment, most often directly through modifications in the energy and communications markets, but also in broad areas such as taxes and export - import policies. Political Risk is a ""supra-legal"" action that has the same impact (e.g., expropriation). Currently the Regulatory Risk Working Group (Fiona Grant is member) is trying to put in place a ""standard"" process to review and analyze regualtory risk around the globe - quite an undertaking. When I use the term Regulatory Risk Management, I am primarily talking about such a process. The key elements of any risk management function are (1) identification, (2) assessment, (3) mitigation / transference, and (4) audit. You would probably agree that the most difficult problem is to try and assess the impact of any Regulatory Risk event. The other key goal is to have a Mitigation Plan in place with an assigned person to ""manage"" our activities so that Enron does not face an associated loss. My goal is to try an have this process in place by mid-year. That would include having undertaken a structured review of our current Assets (the reason for the original questions) and the ability to review pending deals.

"Mark, I am pleased to report that everyone has been working extremely hard to collect all of the information that has been requested (and then some) for purposes of the upcoming due diligence visit. I believe that Brian will find everything most interesting and exciting. While discussing the current situation with Awano and Seguchi we touched upon your initial reaction to our valuation and came upon a fundamental realization. Because we have as yet not shared any of the financial projections for Mutsu Ogawara or Ube with you it is not surprising that you would be unaware of how much value we truly believe we have in these projects. Recognizing that Enron will need to review and evaluate the assumptions we have utilized I still wanted to share some fundamental numbers with you in order to put this value into perspective. Taking the Mutsu Ogawara numbers alone and discounting them to a financial closing date at the end of 2003 (utilizing a 15% discount rate) results in a Net Present Value of US$848 million. In other words, if we were to flip this project at financial close it would be worth at least this much. Using a discount rate of 10%, still considered very high for a Japanese investment return and likely attractive to many Japanese investors, the value is in excess of US$1.5 billion. Looked at another way, discounting the NPV back to 2001 at 15% results in a current NPV of $558 million, or more than $34 per current EnCom share! Assess any reasonable probability factor -50% or 33% - and you still get $11 to $17 share.

"Thanks, Mark. Of course in doing the Reuters telephone interview yesterday morning at Eva's request, for more than an hour, I made all of the critical/ explanatory points, and more, you mention below. The temptation of the quote from the Commission official was obviously irresistible for one of the journalists (Pomeroy) however. On the positive side, however, mention of traders' objections to level and incidence of the proposed tariff, its discriminatory effect, and absence of agreement about implementation in Germany are attributable to my briefing of the other journalist, Orgill. The quoted official is giving the Dominique Ristori (a Commission Energy Policy Director of French nationality) party line, but our ""victory"" is attributable to decisions taken in the Cabinet of Loyola de Palacio, the Energy Commissioner, with whom I intervened on behalf of EFET two weeks ago, and who had already been confronted in September by British government objections. As such, it no longer matters objectively what M. Ristori and his spokespersons think about the ""demise of the 2 euros"". As you and I discussed yesterday, we must now move on rapidly to offer an alternative traders/ system users' solution for establishment of non discriminatory cross border transmission tariffs. An EFET paper for this purpose is already in preparation, and I spoke to the Cabinet of Mario Monti (Competition Commissioner) about the principles involved on Wednesday evening this week.

"As to whether long term contracting by Cal. is a good idea, the answer is somewhat mixed. We were one of the early parties pointing out the problems with total reliance on the spot market and encouraging more forward contracting. Given the utilities' precarious financial position there were two options: 1) outsource the default provider obligation to the market (this is what we prefer but there was no political support for it), or 2) have the state put its credit behind the purchases. California is pursuing the latter, with CDWR prucahsing the utilities' requirements. In the short term, we have criticized the state's plan because it contemplates state takeover of the grid; state participation in power plant financing, construction, and ownership; and they have not made it clear that CDWR really has the money to pay for all the purchases. I am attaching text I have used as the base for a number of communications with policymakers.

Joe tells me that Investor Relations has received some inquiries about ""what is going on in Europe"" yesterday, due to the bad headline Reuters chose below (aided by a self-serving European Commission official), and Dynegy's Q3 earnings showing red ink for Europe. Ignoring the headline, and the quote from the European Commission civil servant (which I will elaborate upon below), this is a BIG WIN. It is progress for liberalisation, and I intend to tell The Economist just that when I do an interview with a reporter later today. This story is about the DEMISE of the ill-conceived 2Euros/MWh export charge. It stands truth and logic on its head to say, as the unnamed European official does, that the demise of the 2 euros charge was anything like ""harmonisation"" or that its demise sets back European liberalisattion. It is now much more likely that we will get a charging regime that will maintain or increase trade, and certainly will not set back trade as the 2 euros would have.
