However, as discussed, outside counsel legal support will be required (i) to set up/register the retail entity to do business (subject to confirmation of the outstanding structuring issue, on which I await an answer); (ii) confirm all regulatory/statutory/licensing requirements for a retail affiliate; (iii) review and advise on contracting forms; and (iv) take an advocacy position for us at upcoming regulatory hearings.

Mark ""JOHN G KLAUBERG"" <JKLAUBER@LLGM.COM> 03/14/2001 06:04 PM To: Mark.E.Haedicke@enron.com cc: Subject: Conflicts Question Mark: I am attaching a copy of a brief memo I received from one of my partners in our Houston office about a potential representation of a company called Centrans, which apparently is a partner with Enron in a Guatemala power project. Centrans apparently plans to sell a piece of its interest to a Fund, in which Enron also owns and interest (although I do not know how much). We would represent Centrans in selling its interest to the Fund. I am not sure, but I do not get the sense from my conversation with my partner that Enron plans to take an active role in the Fund purchase. So, from a conflicts analytical standpoint, this would seem to be analogous to LeBoeuf representing a buyer in connection with the sale of an asset to a corporation in which Enron is a shareholder. Do you have any concerns with LeBoeuf representing Centrans on this sale? Are there any unique facts or circumstances here that you may be aware of that could create a potential problem from your standpoint? I assume this transaction would fall within your ""world"" but, if not, is there somebody else that I should check with on this? We understand that Thelen Reid & Priest is representing the Fund.

In any case, I'd certainly like to have some brochures on hand to be able to answer any questions we get about the product. An update on Blackbird and the situation regarding scrutiny of their electronic trading product ....fortunately there was no correspondence generated from Capitol Hill (Combest or Ewing) asking the CFTC to look more closely at Blackbird's product or electronic trading in general. Upon checking with Committee folks, they were satisfied that Blackbird has been fairly straighforward in having an open dialogue with the CFTC....Blackbird has met with some of the Commissioners already and is meeting with Rainer today to walk them through the product and show why its not something that should be treated as an exchange. Also FYI, Ewing's staff director at the subcommittee, Stacey Carey, is now working for ISDA as a government affairs person. This should bode fairly positively for Ewing's awareness and position on OTC derivatives issues, although she is precluded by ethics rules from lobbying the subcommittee or Ewing for 1 year.

"The Brazilian arbitration statute is only four years old, so arbitration is still somewhat of a new concept. However, businesspeople in the more sophisticated commercial centers (Sao Paulo and Rio) are comfortable with it, as are those companies that have been involved in international projects, are subsidiaries of multi-national companies, or that have relied on offshore financing. Governmental and quasi-governmental entities, including utilities, have been resistant to it, in part because there is language in the Brazilian Constituition that could be interpreted to forbid waiving resort to the courts where natural resources (""patrimonial rights"") are involved. I think where we will get pushback on this policy is with respect to the language of the arbitration and the ICC. For that reason, I suggest we go ahead and ""pre-qualify"" the acceptance of Portugese for contacts where less than $5 million is involved, and the acceptance of alternative arbitral bodies (the Canadian Chamber of Commerce and perhaps FIESP) where less than $3 million is involved. -----Original Message----- From: Haedicke, Mark Sent: Tuesday, April 03, 2001 10:50 AM To: Williams, Robert C.

"I wanted to update you on my request to retain Lynn Slade of Modrall Sperling for a power plant development transaction involving the Seminole Tribe of Florida. In requesting Jim Derrick's approval, he asked that I contact Jim McCartney of Vinson & Elkins to discuss such a retention because Jim McCartney who has had extensive Enron experience regarding our right-of-way agreements through Indian country and recently had a mixed experience with Lynn Slade. Jim has been both candid and very helpful. He has recommended that the better approaches would be either to retain Mike Webster, an Indian lawyer in Montana, or find a lawyer in Florida who has had direct experience with Seminoles. More importantly, Jim graciously offered to review the preliminary letter of intent that we are negotiating and offer his comments based on his general Indian law experience. He will charge the limited amount of time that will be required for this review against his general retainer that he has with Jim Derrick. At this preliminary stage, I believe that Jim's review and comments will suffice for purposes of getting advice on the letter of intent and I will continue to pursue identifying a Florida-based lawyer with experience in dealing with the Seminoles.

The continuous and frequent updating of prices - including the operation of the ""Stack Manager"" which automates this process in many ways so that the system can react more quickly than a person. 4. EnronOnline uses multiple levels of contractual language - a single line ""short description"" of abbreviated terms identifying the transaction to the trader, a long description which defines the abbreviated terms and adds additional legal language and general terms and conditions which contain the remaining contractual terms and are accepted only once by the counterparty. 5. The site directs counterparties to different contracts based on the counterparty profile containing both credit information and information concerning the contracts the counterparty already has in place. 6. It may be relevant for any or all of the foregoing that the EnronOnline system is web-based - i.e. the user does not require any system-specific software but just a web browser (and an internet plug-in application) 7. The Master User account gives the counterparty the ability to set up passwords for sub-users for that entity and control the access and trading authority of various password holders. 8. Each user can create customized screens showing only those products in which he or she is interested. 9. The system provides for the submission of offers to transact by counterparties which are automatic",mark.taylor@enron.com,mark.haedicke@enron.com,"'person' : 'person', 'trader' : 'person', 'user' : 'person', 'user' : 'person'",4,Re: Business Methods on EnronOnline,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,received,mark.haedicke@enron.com
"After our discussion this afternoon, I have given some additional thought -- and talked to outside counsel -- about the negative potential consequences of filing an arbitration against El Paso. While I think we should accept the risks, here they are all from our vantage point: First, El Paso could move the Swap Agreements from EPME and claim the Guaranty Agreements do not follow. Second, we could lose on our claims. This would give El Paso the right to move the Swap Agreements from EPME and claim the Guaranty Agreements do not follow. Third, El Paso could fight us on the arbitrability of the Guaranty Agreement claim. We could end up with two proceedings -- our arbitration and a court proceeding El Paso initiates on the Guaranty Agreement claim. Unfortunately, El Paso would have the opportunity to choose the forum on the Guaranty Agreement claim. Fourth, El Paso could counterclaim on the breach of the confidentiality provision. I think they would have a good argument that we have breached that provision by showing the Swap Agreements etc. to people outside the company such as our bankers. I am not clear what damages they could claim based on that alleged breach. I haven't heard anything to suggest there are other claims out there for El Paso to assert, but we haven't done much investigating in that area either. I suppose if El Paso got really mad, they might look back over the negotiations in this deal and others to see if they have any other claims they could construct.",andrew.edison@enron.com,mark.haedicke@enron.com,"'I' : 'person', 'El Paso' : 'person', 'El Paso' : 'person', 'El Paso' : 'person', 'El Paso' : 'person', 'El Paso' : 'person'",6,El Paso Arbitration,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,received,mark.haedicke@enron.com

"Joe Hartsoe, Rick Shapiro, or Jim Steffes can fill you in on the details of what FERC did today. One question you need to think about is how their decision on price caps affects any contracts which we may have indexed to California's spot market. The way it reports the market clearing price will change fundamentally if prices over 150 will be accepted but not used to clear the market for all bids. So, if we are using this as a reference price in our contracts it may trigger the need to look for alternatives. ----- Forwarded by Steven J Kean/NA/Enron on 11/01/2000 03:39 PM ----- Ann M Schmidt 11/01/2000 10:37 AM To: Mark Palmer/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Karen Denne/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Meredith Philipp/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Steven J Kean/NA/Enron@Enron, Elizabeth Linnell/NA/Enron@Enron, Eric Thode/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Laura Schwartz/Corp/Enron@Enron, Jeannie Mandelker/HOU/ECT@ECT, Mary Clark/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Damon Harvey/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT, Keith Miceli/Corp/Enron@Enron, James D Steffes/NA/Enron@Enron, Richard Shapiro/NA/Enron@Enron cc: Subject: USA: FACTBOX-FERC details changes for Calif power market.

"Mark, Rob Milnthorp has asked me to consider whether there is an artful way under our Master Agreements that upon certain occurrences we could elevate our exposure from unsecured to secured, particularly in circumstances where, for whatever reason, we have not received letters of credit or other collateral. My thought is to insert a clause in our Master Agreements in the nature of a ""floating charge"". The problem with this concept is that it may be resisted within the industry. For example, certain counterparties, i.e. a financial institution or a near-financial institution, such as a bank, a brokerage, a trading institution, etc., would not likely be willing to provide us with security over their assets. In general, counterparties will also have concerns with granting security over their assets, particularly as that security may have restricting consequences for their treasury/banking relationships and covenants, and/or on their ability to conduct business, including disposing of assets which may then require our consent. In addition, it would likely be necessary to introduce this concept on a bilateral basis, such that it would also be binding on us in similar circumstances. (Counterparties could go so far as requiring this concept in our Enron Corp. guarantees.) For example, in the natural gas business in Canada at least, older form marketing agreements and agreements used by gas aggregators with gas producers used ""reserved dedication"" covenants, whereby reserves were dedicated to a particular contract.

John characterized our current position as ""the front of the line without a pass"". 2. Ultimately (and obviously), Dell Williamson will decide to whom these turbines are allocated. 3.

"I spoke with Stacey Carey today after the ISDA call. I reiterated that we have been willing to support the process so far on the understanding that we would prefer a bill that gives us parity with financial products and, failing that, the minimum we can accept is a bill which exempts (preferably excludes) energy commodities and hopefully metals from the Act. She confirmed that ISDA will continue to push for the exemption or exclusion. The comments from Treasury to Chris Long recently underscore that our ""Phil Graham card"", to the extent we have one, is a significant political strength for us and we should not play the card until we need to. Stacey agreed with a statement made by Don Moorehead on this morning's call that Graham will not start to move in the process until the House has produced a viable bill. Given that we should probably not seek his help until a bit later in the process - possibly mid September.

"Mark, Further to my e-mail to you of last week on the above subject, I have now reviewed the due diligence which was undertaken by Enron Houston with local Indian Counsel (Crawford Bailey & Co.) on the above topic in January 1997. That due diligence reveals the following: Prior Reserve Bank of India (""RBI"") approval required to do business in India: If Enron is considered to be ""doing business in India"" (which it would, for example, if we had a branch or entity there) we shall require the prior consent of the RBI under Section 29 (1) (a) Foreign Exchange Regulation Act 1973 (""FERA"") e.g. to set up the branch or entity. Please note that at the date of the opinion from Indian counsel (14th January, 1997), Indian counsel opined that no guidelines had been set down as to any conditions necessary to be satisfied by a foreign company in order to obtain approval from the RBI to do business in India. This needs to be revisited as to the requirements. Repatriation of proceeds / Exchange Control: Please note that in the approval which would need to be obtained from the RBI, such approval would state whether the revenues generated in India could be repatriated e.g., to the USA, or not. I assume that we would require such ability to repatriate and so we shall have to ensure that the RBI approval covered it. We also need to check if there are now any limits to such repatriation.
