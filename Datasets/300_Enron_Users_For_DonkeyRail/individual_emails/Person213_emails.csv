"Gerald, In Illinois, the courts have generally held a contract may be assigned to another party if the contract is silent on whether the contract is assignable. However, the case law fails to specifically discuss if consent of the non-assigning party is required for the assignment to be valid.

"First Leg Of Radiohead Dates Begin Mid-June In Texas May 2, 4 a.m. ET, SonicNet Brian Hiatt After playing only two small-scale U.S. shows in support of their last album, Kid A, Radiohead will meet the masses next month on their first full-fledged North American tour in three years. Following the June 5 release of Amnesiac, the formerly reclusive experimental rockers will begin a tour of outdoor amphitheaters on June 18 in Spring, Texas, just north of Houston. From there, the first leg of the U.K. band's tour will move through the West, ending June 30 in Santa Barbara, California. More dates are expected to follow. Radiohead bassist Colin Greenwood has described Amnesiac as falling somewhere between the band's original, guitar-driven sound and the icy electronics of the chart-topping Kid A. ""It's about 50-50,"" Greenwood said earlier this year. ""It's got more traditional Radiohead-type songs together with more experimental, nonlyrical-based instrumental-type stuff as well, and it works as a record in its entirety, which is what we care about.""

"Eric, This looks good to me. One other aspect is the actual process vs what is described in the agreement. Let me give a brief synopsis of what transpires. You may want to make additional changes to the agreement. 1. Specifications, quantities and pricing are agreed upon between Matt Ligon/Daniel & Perry Roberts/HPL. 2. Purchase information records are created within Enron's SAP MM system that ties the specific material to a vendor and a price for consignment inventory purposes. 3. A purchase order is created to order in the initial consigned inventory. The purchase order reflects no values because the vendor still owns the material until it is needed by HPL or the term length agreed upon ends and the purchase order is linked to the purchase information record. 4. The material is received and becomes a vendor owned consigned inventory in our facility. 5. When the material is needed, it is issued out of inventory via a Goods Issue SAP entry. This causes a financial settlement transaction to be routed from SAP MM to Accounts Payable for payment to the vendor. 6. Restocking is made by issuing additional purchase orders for consignment.
