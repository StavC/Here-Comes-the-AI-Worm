"David, I called our Credit Group to look into how large Enron's corporate guaranty is with the Duke pipelines (i.e. TETCO and Algonquin) to make sure that we will pass the credit check that will occur when the capacity is released to us. Two counter-parties, ENA and ENA Upstream, are set up to do capacity release and other transport deals with Duke with a maximum guaranty of $16 million. TETCO has ENA down for$1.7 million that has to cover three months of demand charges. ENA has no other TETCO capacity at the present time, so there should be no problems passing TETCO's automatic credit check during the capacity release process. Please note that for the two structures we just discussed, the capacity needs to be both recallable and reputtable. If Yankee and Legal gets comfortable with the other features of the proposed structure, the gas sales price should also include the TETCO commodity cost reimbursement when Yankee calls on the gas and ENA elects to not re-release the capacity back to Yankee.

"I need your help to make sure that the P&L/cash estimates get updated to record the February and March capacity release revenue that ENA will be receiving from Transwestern under K#24942 (i.e. Ignacio to Blanco I/B Link). It is my understanding that Kim will be flashing the expense at our contract rate of $0.06/Dth, therefore the demand expense that should be flashed is $42,000 for February and $46,500 for March. TW released the capacity at the maximum rate of $0.102/Dth for February and March. TW will keep $0.021/Dth or 50% of the amount above ENA's discounted rate (i.e. $14,700 for February and $16,275 for March). To offset ENA's demand expenses of $0.06/Dth, the invoice will also show a credit of $0.081/Dth or $56,700 for February and $62,775 for March.

"Last year money was to be set aside in reserves to cover the net amount needed to resolve these issues with Transco, BUG , LILCO and Enron. The total dollars required was approximately $4.25 million. An amount of $3.55 million needed for the Transco historical imbalance resolution. The remaining balance was needed for the BUG and LILCO accounting issues that Keyspan brought to our attention last year. Bob Hall has $3.5 million reserved in his area for the Transco historical imbalance. The remaining $50,000 for Transco and approximately $700,000 of additional funds for the accounting issues were to be reserved last year under ""The Office of the Chairman"". Sally Beck and Janet Dietrich arranged for this additional money to be reserved at the ""Chairman"" level since the additional funds were needed to correct an old accounting problem that should not hit the East Desk P&L. Also, the arrangement was that the reserve would be maintained until the settlement payments were made by Enron. As with most stories, there is some good news and some bad news. First, the bad news. After a great deal of investigation, it appears that there currently is no reserve at the ""Office of the Chairman"" for these additional funds. Now, the good news.

Below is a brief description of the other changes: Off-Peak Transaction: Different physical plant burns for weekdays or weekends & holidays Baseload resale of gas back to ENA ENA's balancing capabilities in Canada will level out varying plant burns ENA's balancing charges, if any, are included in the keep whole formula No obligation to sell incremental gas supply into Empire ( i.e. No Part II ) Hourly average of the off-peak LBMP's is used in pricing formula On-Peak Transaction: On-peak LBMP's is used in pricing formulas ENA obligation to sell incremental gas supply into Empire under Part II Plase call me with your comments, Ruth",ruth.concannon@enron.com,"mrosenberg@sithe.com, joliver@sithe.com","'address' : 'address', 'Ruth' : 'person'",2,Sithe / Independence MW Turndown for Off-Peak & On-Peak Periods,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,sent,ruth.concannon@enron.com

"As we discussed yesterday, the TCPL Mainline Service and Pricing Settlement language on the proposed Capacity Turnback Policy may be very important feature of the Settlement if ENA ends up reducing its sale to the plant and is responsible for mitigating the cost of Sithe's transportation upstream of Chippawa. The other features such as FT Make-Up Credits and AOS Credits on Sithe's transport will create new opportunities to generate incremental revenues for ENA and Sithe. The IT Floor Price will directly impact the ""death spiral"" of future capacity decontracting and resulting increased demand charges for Sithe if the IT Floor is placed below 100% of firm tolls. Here are some additional comments and questions on the draft language on TCPL's Turnback Policy: 1) Policy is good only through December 31, 2002, the ending date of the Settlement. There are a couple pipeline expansions (i.e. Iroquois' Eastchester and a rumored alternative to the Canadian portion of Millenium) that have a Fall 2003 in-service date. Will TCPL's ""queue"" for new capacity kick-off the Turnback Policy? Is there a requirement that TCPL's upstream capacity match up with takeaway capacity in the U.S., for example Iroquois's 230,000 dth/d Eastchester project. Sithe's capacity may only partially prevent an additional expansion from Dawn to Waddington. Sithe's capacity, however, would have higher value if the rumored Dawn to Niagara expansion alternative to Millenium becomes a reality.

"Everybody got alot accomplished today on our firedrill. Yeah Team! Here's a quick update: Maria, located the missing ""DRI Operating"" agreements and correspondence. See the fax I sent to your computer. The bad news, it is a 1 year, evergreen agreement with 60 days notice by either party prior to the end of the contract year (i.e. 60 days notice prior to October 31, 2002) to terminate. Looks like paying them for post petition gas and reject the contract may be the best answer for the estate.

Chris, has been reviewing Wade's TCO data and comparing it to pipeline gathering invoices. I can't answer your question about whether we are making money yet, but we are getting really close to the answer. He is getting all the data together for the sales pitch now, so that everything will go smoothly next week. He is also attacking all the other companies that relate to the producers. Wade & Robin & Chris are working on the Dominion producers to try to see if they can approximate the high level summary retroactive reallocation volume adjustments that Chris has prepared. I will forward you Wade's email from Dominion that says that any additional detail is tied up in bankruptcy court.

Jeff Hodge approved the original sale to CMS and was involved with negotiating with MichCon on this and a number of other matters.

The boiler-plate language is identical to the document sent to you earlier. The only changes are to the DCQ, Delivery Points, and Contract Price language for Part I. These changes incorporate Sithe's concerns that the month of October should be divided in two parts, one when the full plant is available and the other when the only one block is available. For invoicing purposes, it has been assumed the GSA sales reduction tied to one block being down for 15 days would keep ENA whole for what the GSA sales volumes would have been if there had not been a MW Turndown transaction.

Kevin Heal from our Calgary Office, represented Enron in the Settlement discussions. Enron elected to abstain when the vote was taken to approve the Settlement. Sithe/Independence voted to oppose and litigate the Settlement.

"Last year money was to be set aside in reserves to cover the net amount needed to resolve these issues with Transco, BUG , LILCO and Enron.

The remaining balance was needed for the BUG and LILCO accounting issues that Keyspan brought to our attention last year. Bob Hall has $3.5 million reserved in his area for the Transco historical imbalance. The remaining $50,000 for Transco and approximately $700,000 of additional funds for the accounting issues were to be reserved last year under ""The Office of the Chairman"". Sally Beck and Janet Dietrich arranged for this additional money to be reserved at the ""Chairman"" level since the additional funds were needed to correct an old accounting problem that should not hit the East Desk P&L. Also, the arrangement was that the reserve would be maintained until the settlement payments were made by Enron. As with most stories, there is some good news and some bad news. First, the bad news.

His comments are as follows: 1. Generally, Hugh is adamant that the proposed offer to sell gas to Bridgeline be solely for the gas and not include any discount component for storage and transportation. 2. He is also firm that we pay for one month of transport and storage to move the gas off-system. He envisions full service under the contracts during this period such that all scheduling and other provisions under the contract are followed as in the normal course of business. The plan would be for us to try to get all of the gas out of storage in month. To the extent that residual gas remains, Bridgeline may be willing to buy it to avoid triggering another month of services under the contracts. 3. Hugh wanted clarification on the segregated account. He wants this concept back in and is not comfortable with any potential lien attachment afforded under Section 7-209 of the Louisiana UCC. 4. Hugh stuck to the issues related to the movement/sale of gas out and storage and did not attempt to link the removal of the gas to rejection of the contracts.

"Ruth, I wanted to give you the details of how we placed these numbers in Sithe's P&L. 1. Instead of reducing the purchase price in Sitara(we would capture this revenue in the P&L in two months with OA, we want to complete the transaction in the current P&L) we have written a physical annuity between ENA and Sithe Power QP7914.2. Please settle this with January's physical purchase. 2. Sithe then receives 50% of this incremental revenue, this was booked in a financial annuity QP7914.1, this should also be settled with January's invoices. 3. We have placed the Power portion of the revenue in Schedule B in the FT-Ontario book(this is due to the Sithe P&L limitations, we will be modifying the book set up for any future deals such as this). A financial annuity was then written between Sithe and Ontario to recognize the schedule B item in the sithe book and keep Ontario flat(TAGG#QP7914.3). 4. The final $550,919 was then granted out to you via origination from the FT-Ontario book(same reasons as above) and an annuity was then written to the FT-Ontario book to keep it flat.(TAGG#QP7914.4). These four deals in TAGG will keep the sithe book flat and should accomplish the goals of your email below. If you have any questions or concerns, please feel free to contact me at 3-7376. Thanks.

It is a maximum rate transport contract that allows discounting of transport rates. I do not know what the maximum transport rate is for Bridgeline, but it is probably one rate for the entire pipeline. No active discounts were found in ENA's records. With the pipeline's cooperation, however, new discounts can be negotiated. 2) Under ENA's firm storage agreement, you must withdraw it from storage at the Storage Delivery/Redelivery Point which is defined as the interconnect between the storage field and Bridgeline Pipeline System. This means that some sort of transportation agreement on Bridgeline must be used if ENA does not sell the inventory in place. 3) Chris is making some preliminary calls to gauge the market interest for purchasing ENA's storage inventory",chris.germany@enron.com,ruth.concannon@enron.com,"'Concannon, Ruth' : 'person', 'Schneider, Chip' : 'person', 'Gray, Barbara N.' : 'person', 'Kelly, Neil' : 'person', 'Bartlett, Jeff' : 'person', 'Sharp, Greg' : 'person', 'Coffey Jr., Jim' : 'person', 'Thompkins, Jason' : 'person', 'Ellenberg, Mark' : 'person', 'McMichael Jr., Ed' : 'person', 'Germany, Chris' : 'person', 'Garza, Maria' : 'person', 'Chip' : 'person', 'Chris' : 'person'",14,"RE: Bridgeline Storage Company, LLC",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,received,ruth.concannon@enron.com

"Ruth, I wanted to give you the details of how we placed these numbers in Sithe's P&L. 1. Instead of reducing the purchase price in Sitara(we would capture this revenue in the P&L in two months with OA, we want to complete the transaction in the current P&L) we have written a physical annuity between ENA and Sithe Power QP7914.2. Please settle this with January's physical purchase. 2. Sithe then receives 50% of this incremental revenue, this was booked in a financial annuity QP7914.1, this should also be settled with January's invoices. 3. We have placed the Power portion of the revenue in Schedule B in the FT-Ontario book(this is due to the Sithe P&L limitations, we will be modifying the book set up for any future deals such as this).

The deadline to submit a response is this afternoon at 5:00 pm with the understanding that a binding precedent agreement with termination outs needs to be executed by tomorrow afternoon (i.e. Thursday, November 29th). I told Julie that I thought it was best if ENEL, rather than ENA, submitted the open season response and signed Tennessee's PA. That way ENEL's RFP response would not get snarled up with any credit concerns that Tennessee had with the Enron Corp. announcements. I told her that we were still an on-going concern and still wanted to sell gas to the project. She appreciated our honesty and reaffirmed that ENEL was still interested in entering into a fuel supply arrangement with ENA. Also, I just received an announcement from Rio Bravo Pipeline that said that ""due to the CFE changing the date on which the bidders must present their Bid Proposals for the Rio Bravo IV Project from December 4, 2001 to December 11, 2001"" that the Rio Bravo Pipeline Open Season was also being pushed back to December 7, 2001.

Firm Gas Storage Service K# 38454 (FS-MA Assign) -- Assignment from New York State Electric & Gas Company Gas Transportation Agreement K# 38535 (FT-A Assign) -- Assignment from New York State Electric & Gas Company Gas Transportation Agreement K# 38539 (FT-A Assign) -- Assignment from New York State Electric & GAs Company All 3 capacity releases from NYSEG are non-recallable. In my opinion, this capacity should be the property of the customers EES was serving behind the NYSEG city gate and the capacity should go with the customers. But, I believe we need to address the LDC tariff issues along with the pipeline issues. Gas Transportation Agreement K#27848 (IT) Supply Aggregation Servic e Agreement K# 80265 (SA) Of all the items shown above, I am more concerned with the Balancing Agreement k#31905. We need to know what has happened to the sales",chris.germany@enron.com,ruth.concannon@enron.com,'Sherry Glazebrook' : 'person',1,RE: Tennessee Gas Pipeline Contracts --  EES,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,received,ruth.concannon@enron.com

"Ruth: In follow-up to our telephone conversation, I am confirming that it is my analysis of the purchase agreement between CES and ENA that ENA must refund to CES any transportation refunds it gets relating to the CES transportation contracts that relate to activity prior to January 1, 2000. Likewise, if there are costs relating to such contracts prior to January 1, 2000, those are the responsibility of CES. I hope this helps to clarify the situation.
