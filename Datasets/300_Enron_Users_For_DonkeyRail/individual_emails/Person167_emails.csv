WAIT FOR A BETTER PROTECTIVE ORDER Ask Harvey Morris where they are on fixing the protective order that is being litigated by others. If the protective order has not changed, then unilaterally postpone production until it is. Pro: Better protection and more time; Con: Even with a more stringent protective order Enron still questions whether the PUC is entitled to financial performance data. Thus, this option does not fully disclose all of Enron's positions and the company may be accused later of simply engaging in delaying tactics. Under this option we file our formal objections as well. 2. TURN OVER THE TRANSACTION DATA AS IS Continue on our present course of turning over transaction data for electricity that was delivered. Pro: PUC will get the data anyway either through FERC, unfair competition, antitrust or price gouging litigation. By turning over the data that will show profits, PUC might slow down investigation there as opposed to interrupting the business by seeking to depose",richard.sanders@enron.com,sbishop@gibbs-bruns.com,"'Fergus, Gary S.' : 'person', 'GFergus@brobeck.com>' : 'email', 'Richard B.

"Richard, FYI. Per my voice-mail of a moment ago, while I appreciate Matt having raised the possibility of ECT making a bad situation worse by finding a ""bug"", I am not inclined to stop the testing. I agree with David Best's sense that if there is a ""bug"" in the product at the time it was loaded from the supplier's mooring facility, and if Mitsubishi or an end-user comes after ECT with a claim that, e.g., the ""bug"" contaminated the ship's later cargoes, the presence of ""bug"" in the product would seem to give us a pretty good argument against the supplier, in this case, a Phillips entity. Please also keep in mind that our testing is not just for a ""bug"", but also to see whether the possibility of the aging of the cargo may have caused the loadport samples to fail. If we stop the testing now, our chances of recovering any settlement from Mitsubishi or the cargo underwriters are remote. In fact, Jim Studdert just advised that he spoke with the local adjuster for our cargo underwriters,and was told, ""I don't think it was an insurable claim if it was contaminated when it was loaded aboard the ship."" This statement was not a surprise to Jim or me. By copy of this, I wonder if Mike could send to me a copy of the general terms and conditions that David Best references below.

Claim Against Underwriters PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL: ATTORNEY-CLIENT COMMUNICATION, ATTORNEY WORK-PRODUCT Richard, This will acknowledge receipt of and thank you for the above-referenced new matter, which you and I first spoke about February 15. I understand that Enron Petrochemicals, Inc. has made a claim against Underwriters for over $900,000 as the result of the contamination of a load of styrene monomer that was discovered on or about November 4, 1999 in a tank facility located in Texas. You asked me initially to investigate Underwriters' claim that they may have been prejudiced by Enron's failure to either obtain a time bar from or sue Baytank, which owns the tank at issue, within one year from the date of the incident. You will recall that I thought little of that defense, for the following reasons: 1.

At least that is what our deal ticket indicated. Conectiv/Delmarva disagreed vehemently, contending that they were the buyer and we were the seller. Last week I obtained the tapes from the broker, Natsource. I previously forwarded the tapes to you. The tapes unequivocally indicate that we were the seller.

Mr. Ramos has made an appearance on behalf of San Juan Gas in the local fashion which provides for an automatic extension of time within which to file a responsive pleading. Mr. Ramos is presently preparing to conduct an initial investigation in order to determine the nature of the responsive pleading to be filed.

According to Bob, since TVA is asking for specific performance, it may not be reasonable for TVA to cover entire period. I will try to talk to him tonight.). If TVA accepts one of our proposals and then we lose the termination argument, what do we do? Supply? Terminate Again? In either case our proposal for 7 years will likely not cap our damages.

"Here is another incident stemming from the A-S 30 inch pipeline rupture of December 4, 2000. Although the facts are still being developed, this customer was also being supplied off of the A-S line and when it went down, HPL had to activate another pipeline to serve this customer from a different source or direction. This line may have had some liquids settled in the line or other sediments which became dislodged and ultimately may have caused a failure at Ameripol's boiler. This resulted in a fire which they claim caused equipment and product damages. Liquids are not identified in the quality specifications for the gas to be delivered to Ameripol, only not more than 20 grains of sulfur or 7 pounds of water vapor. Additionally, the contract does contain a waiver of consequential damages. Gary indicated to me that they told him that about $130,000 of the loss was a result of lost sales due to the inability to produce product.
