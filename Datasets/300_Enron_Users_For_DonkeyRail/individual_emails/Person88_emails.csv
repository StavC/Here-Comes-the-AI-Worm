As you can see from the attached files, all the firm books have the same book code, ""MF"". When accounting pulls the liquidations from TAGG, it is by book code and region. When we pull the ""MF"" book code with ""Financial"" as the region, we will be getting the liquidations for John Arnold's book, Mike Maggi's book, etc. We will have no way to determine which liquidations belong to which book.

The files would contain prices for the swaps, futures and money market instruments that are used to build the curve, and also the corresponding zero coupon rates on a continuous A/365 basis.

The new process flow for ERMS bridging requests and corrections is as follows: 1) All requests for bridge logic corrections and enhancements will need to be forwarded by email through the EOL Product Control Group and should be prioritized as either ""Immediate"" or ""standard"". ""Immediates"" are emergency requests for which other programming efforts being made by the ERMS IT team will be placed on hold, while ""standard"" requests will be placed on ERMS's developmental time-table in the order received. ** Note: Tara Sweitzer will be sending a supplemental email to the various Risk groups of current programming issues for prioritization. 2) Once received, developmental requests will be evaluated by the ERMS IT team.

"All - I talked to Zhiyong Wei, who works for Jeff Johnson, and John Lavorato. It sounds like there are a few issues that need to be resolved. 1. Apparently it has been decided that someone (?) from UBS will be providing a curve beginning on day 1. That person has yet to be identified. 2. There will have to be a daily interpolation of the curve into ERMS on a daily basis. This presents a couple of problems. Someone must approve the interpolation, and the official curve does not come out until 5:00 P.M. Central Time. This means that after the interpolation and system load, it would probably be somewhere north of 6:00 PM before we could start our nightly process. A difficult sell to say the least. 3. There are offers out to two interest rate traders in Houston, but we still have not determined whom we will be working with from a Houston perspective. Hopefully, decisions will be made by Monday. Are you guys aware if there is a preliminary curve that we can use that comes out a bit earlier, and we can just have finance run with the official curve the next day? Bottom Line : It sounds like they have worked out a process, but not necessarily a great one.

For the first few weeks ( to a few months) we continue to use Infinity to update the curves at 2 PM. I will need to have one trader to execute, mark curves and do any deals for foreign exchange (Cd$ etc.). Louise, I hope you have this in your budget and headcount. I will need one junior trader(and maybe two as things grow) to help do this job. I have lined up one of the guys in the old trading desk, if this goes forward. 2. In the first few weeks, Jay Webb and myself are hoping to acquire a lighter, and much simpler interest rate package which will allow us to do what we do, with significantly lower costs. We also will re-design the way we aggregate interest rate risk in the commodity books, to make it simpler and easier. To ensure there is no more discussion ever of drift-reallocation, I propose a method where, every desk head gets back his complete interest rate portfolio drift every month or quarter (less any transaction expenses ).

You were the signatory for ECT at that time. These price curves are used by the pipelines for risk management purposes. Currently, we are implementing a new risk system and would like the ability to use this system across all of ETS' pipes.

"O'neal Winfree currently manages the Texas risk management group for natural gas and is also responsible for the benchmark reporting group. He works closely with the Desk director and other traders to ensure accurate reporting of the positions and P&L's. He has eliminated most OA variances on his desk and has helped the other regions as well. O'neal and his group recently created a new physical P&L reporting tool to assist the risk and trading groups. Scott Palmer is currently the East desk lead and was the central desk lead prior to that. He set up and managed the Wellhead region and created new reporting tools for the traders to manage their supply. He was also responsible for calculating and reporting the Virginia Natural Gas asset management book and worked closely with the structuring group and others at VNG and Sequent to resolve any issues or questions. James Hungerford has been a book administrator on the East region for the past six months. He quickly became an important part of the team by managing up to three traders' P&L's and making numerous improvements to our daily routines such as streamlining the Weapon-X database, automating the new deal checkout and implementing a daily VaR estimate process. Prior to risk management, James was the Operational Analysis coordinator for the east region and worked with risk management and other downstream groups to clean-up all past variances and helped eliminate future problems.",kam.keiser@enron.com,c..gossett@enron.com,"'O'neal Winfree' : 'person', 'Scott Palmer' : 'person', 'James Hungerford' : 'person'",3,promotions,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,received,c..gossett@enron.com

"Jeff, I could be in a tough situation at the desk with personnel. Right now Daren Farmer is evaluating an opportunity with AEP. If he stays and if we get pressure for another round of cuts; I may be in a situation that I have to do something with Dave. If Daren leaves then Dave is really the only one remaining with Waha experience, that is why I decided to move him to the desk. Bottom line to me is that based on discussions with you in the past and my experience, Dave is definitely a keeper for Risk and has gained some physical experience in the last six months that will help me out particularly if Daren leaves. Needless to say there are a lot of variables to manage here but I thought you should be aware it, particularly if I end up in a situation where I have to make more cuts. I am sure you are in a similar situation with some of your folks so you can probably relate to what I am going through. I will catch up with you as this unfolds but if possible don't completely put Dave out of your plans at this point.

As you can see from the attached files, all the firm books have the same book code, ""MF"". When accounting pulls the liquidations from TAGG, it is by book code and region. When we pull the ""MF"" book code with ""Financial"" as the region, we will be getting the liquidations for John Arnold's book, Mike Maggi's book, etc. We will have no way to determine which liquidations belong to which book. I just have a concern that if/when we have variances we would not be able to determine which trader's book was the cause of the variance.

Each of these commodities required significant time spent learning about the new commodity, training with the groups that handle these commodities, and learning a new P&L reporting format for each new commodity.
