"Tim I thought I would give you a simple overview of the gas market. This may help you prepare for Thursday. Everyday roughly 55 Billion Cubic Feet of gas is produced. The bulk of this production is in Texas, Louisiana, and Oklahoma. In the winter, the US daily load is greater than 55 BCF and in the summer, the daily US load is less than 55 BCF. Therefore, storage fields are needed to smooth out the seasonal differences in load. Texas and Louisiana are two of the largest consumers of natural gas. However these states produce more gas than they consume. Most other states consume more gas than they produce. Therefore pipelines were built to solve the regional imbalances. Most of these pipelines originate out of LA and TX and move gas to the areas of greatest demand. Our goal is to gain a handle on where the daily production is moving and if the daily production is growing or shrinking. Very simplistic, but maybe it helps.

"Per our discussion, here is where we are on the Devon / Midcon (now Oneok) Quinduno well issue: For the Devon purchase, we have been showing a price of the NGPL-Midcontinent index + $.01 less $.3276 gathering--the 8.5% fuel was never shown in Sitara and has never been deducted from Devon's purchase price as it should have been. This purchase falls under the ""big"" Devon deal that came to us from CES--it is my understanding that this contract ends in July of this year. Mary Ellenberger handles Devon and should take care of the 8.5% fuel issue retroactively to January 2000. For the Midcon Texas (now Oneok) sale, we have been showing in Sitara the NGPL-Midcontinent index less 8.5% fuel--the $.3276 gathering fee has never showed up in Sitara as a deduction from the sales price as it should have been. Also, Oneok has never paid ENA for this gas all the way back to January 2000 due to the fact that there was no contract. George Smith is taking care of the Midcon (now Oneok) issue. For March forward, Oneok has made it clear to George that they want to negotiate a price with us for this production. They have agreed to take all production between 1/00 and 2/01 at NGPL Index flat less $.3276 gathering , less 8.5% fuel. When this is all cleaned up, the difference between the 8.5% fuel charge we will receive from Devon vs. the $.3276 gathering fee we will not collect from Midcon Texas is the",colleen.sullivan@enron.com,hunter.shively@enron.com,"'Mary Ellenberger' : 'person', 'George Smith' : 'person'",2,Midcon Gas Products./ Devon Summary,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,received,hunter.shively@enron.com

"For December 21, 2000 activity, I reported a weighted average price of $10.77 for all activity at NGPL Nicor. The following Chicago Midpoint Pricing was reported to Gas Daily: December 21, 2000 $10.77 December 22, 2000 $15.76 The December 22, 2000 midpoint reflected a weighted average price for flow on gas days December 22-26, 2000. The reason for the lengthy trading period was due to Nicor Gas Company being closed on Friday, December 22, 2000, as opposed to December 26, 2000 ( the majority of the companies recognized December 26, 2000 as the holiday). Nicor Gas Company made the decision to buy additional gas on December 22nd for flow on December 23-26, 2000. Since I did not trade incremental volumes for this time period, I reported the same prices and volumes that I had previously traded for this time period. I did receive several phone calls from other marketing companies expressing concern that Gas Daily was going to come out with a new posting for the December 22-26, 2000 time period, when in fact, the incremental volume that Nicor purchased made up a small percentage of the total volume for that time period. I phoned Dave Behrman at Gas Daily to determine if this were true, and he replied that they would make a decision once they gathered all third party information.",patrice.mims@enron.com,hunter.shively@enron.com,'Dave Behrman' : 'person',1,"Gas Daily Chicago MidPoint Posting for December 21, 22, and 23,

For those of us who believe that as an unquestioned article of faith, let me give you a little history lesson. You'll see that it can get a lot worse than this. For our little history lesson we'll focus on the S&P 500, because that pretty much represents the entire US equity market. Obviously the NASDAQ has had it a lot worse -- but that's only a subset of the total market, and it's fairly concentrated in a single broad sector: technology. In subsequent commentaries the NASDAQ will get its turn in the historical spotlight. Over the last two quarters the S&P 500 lost 19.23%. As horrific as that has been, that actually only ranks 78th out of the 2409 six-month periods since 1800. Believe it or not, there have been 77 that were worse. There were eight six-month periods in which the S&P 500 lost more than 40%. There were 18 in which it lost more than 30%. The very worst single six-month period was the one ending May, 1932, in which the S&P 500 lost an astonishing 52.92%.

"For December 21, 2000 activity, I reported a weighted average price of $16.00 for activity for December 22-26, 2000. The weighted average trade price via Enron Online will reflect a price of $15.76, but coupled with the volume not transacted online, this price was estimated to be a $16.00 midpoint. Specificially the following trades were transacted over the telephone: Nicor Gas Company $18.16 20,000 Via ANR @ Hampshire Altrade GDD +.05 10,000 NGPL Nicor WPS GDD 5,000 NGPL Nicor Nicor Gas Company $12.00 20,000 NGPL Nicor PG&E $14.00 9,000 NGPL Nicor Kaztex $18.16 4,000 NBPL/Nicor The reason for the interest in this time period is as follows: Nicor Gas Company observed their company holiday on December 22nd, while most companies observed the company holiday on December 26th. As a result, volumes were traded for the December 22-26 time period. Gas Daily published a price of $15.70 for the December 22-26 time period. Nicor Gas Company made a decision to buy gas on December 22nd for the December 23-26 time period.

For those of us who believe that as an unquestioned article of faith, let me give you a little history lesson. You'll see that it can get a lot worse than this. For our little history lesson we'll focus on the S&P 500, because that pretty much represents the entire US equity market. Obviously the NASDAQ has had it a lot worse -- but that's only a subset of the total market, and it's fairly concentrated in a single broad sector: technology. In subsequent commentaries the NASDAQ will get its turn in the historical spotlight. Over the last two quarters the S&P 500 lost 19.23%. As horrific as that has been, that actually only ranks 78th out of the 2409 six-month periods since 1800. Believe it or not, there have been 77 that were worse. There were eight six-month periods in which the S&P 500 lost more than 40%. There were 18 in which it lost more than 30%. The very worst single six-month period was the one ending May, 1932, in which the S&P 500 lost an astonishing 52.92%.

"Per our discussion, here is where we are on the Devon / Midcon (now Oneok) Quinduno well issue: For the Devon purchase, we have been showing a price of the NGPL-Midcontinent index + $.01 less $.3276 gathering--the 8.5% fuel was never shown in Sitara and has never been deducted from Devon's purchase price as it should have been. This purchase falls under the ""big"" Devon deal that came to us from CES--it is my understanding that this contract ends in July of this year. Mary Ellenberger handles Devon and should take care of the 8.5% fuel issue retroactively to January 2000. For the Midcon Texas (now Oneok) sale, we have been showing in Sitara the NGPL-Midcontinent index less 8.5% fuel--the $.3276 gathering fee has never showed up in Sitara as a deduction from the sales price as it should have been. Also, Oneok has never paid ENA for this gas all the way back to January 2000 due to the fact that there was no contract. George Smith is taking care of the Midcon (now Oneok) issue. For March forward, Oneok has made it clear to George that they want to negotiate a price with us for this production. They have agreed to take all production between 1/00 and 2/01 at NGPL Index flat less $.3276 gathering , less 8.5% fuel.

"For December 21, 2000 activity, I reported a weighted average price of $10.77 for all activity at NGPL Nicor.

Nicor Gas Company made the decision to buy additional gas on December 22nd for flow on December 23-26, 2000. Since I did not trade incremental volumes for this time period, I reported the same prices and volumes that I had previously traded for this time period. I did receive several phone calls from other marketing companies expressing concern that Gas Daily was going to come out with a new posting for the December 22-26, 2000 time period, when in fact, the incremental volume that Nicor purchased made up a small percentage of the total volume for that time period.

"On December 21, 2000, I reported a weighted average price of $16.00 for gas flow on December 22-26, 2000. The weighted average trade price via Enron Online will reflect a price of $15.76. This price was increased to $16.00 to encompass trades transacted via the telephone. The reason for the interest in this time period is as follows: Nicor Gas Company was closed for their company holiday on Friday, December 22nd. As a result, volumes delivered at Nicor were traded for the December 22-26 time period. Gas Daily published a price of $15.70 for the December 22-26 time period. Nicor Gas Company made a decision to buy gas on December 22nd (even though they were closed) for the December 23-26 time period, which resulted in a $13.88 posting for the December 23-26th period. I received several phone calls from various marketing companies expressing concern that Gas Daily was going to revise the posting, based on the minimal activity that transacted on December 22nd. While, my practice is to simply take the price as reported on Enron Online, from time-to-time, there will be significant volumes transacted over the telephone that will impact the Enron Online price.
