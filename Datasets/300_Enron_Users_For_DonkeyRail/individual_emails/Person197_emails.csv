Kate Symes 04/20/2001 10:15 AM To: Sharen Cason/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: Subject: Re: 586775 I just spoke with Heather Dunton in Risk, and she said they've had problems valuing index forward deals that settle at the last 5-day NYMEX average. So to remedy the situation, they're taking a fifth of the volume out of the deal each day, beginning five days prior to the expiry date. In this case, the expiry date is 4/25/01, so they began with taking 5 MW out of deal 585480 and putting it into a fixed price forward deal - 586775. Each day Heather will take another fifth of the volume in 585480 and put it into 586775, and she'll average the fixed prices each day to eventually end up with the last 5-day average. That's the long and short of why this new forward deal - 586775 - doesn't need to be confirmed. Our position with Deseret stays the same - it's just split between two deals temporarily. Please call Heather or me with any questions. She's going to add another comment in both deals to indicate the changes she'll be making, so it should be apparent to everyone that 586775 does not need to be confirmed at any point. When we get to the expiry date, Heather will kill that fixed forward deal, since the index price will pull into the system and 585480 will value",sharen.cason@enron.com,kate.symes@enron.com,"'Kate Symes' : 'person', 'Sharen Cason' : 'person', 'Heather Dunton' : 'person', '4/25/01' : 'credit card expiration date'",4,Re: 586775,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,sent,sharen.cason@enron.com

"Sorry for the delay - it's taken me a while to track down the answer to this, because Chris Foster, the trader on this deal, is still unclear as to the answer. Basically, the deal keeps getting cut by the Cal-ISO, which is why Carla goes in and changes the volumes sometimes. But Chris thinks that in the end we might not be cutting the deal financially, just physically on a day-by-day basis. Given that, we only need the first, original confirm sent out - if revised confirms have been sent, let's go ahead and send them the original one and leave it at that. Chris Foster said he would get back with me this afternoon - he's meeting with Real Time and Schedulers right now to sort out this issue. I apologize that this wasn't more clear before.
