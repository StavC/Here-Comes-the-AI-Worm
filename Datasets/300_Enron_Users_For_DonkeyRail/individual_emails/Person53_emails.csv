Check with Settlements to see if they are billing us for Dec and Jan. d Michael Olsen@ENRON 02/14/2001 04:04 PM To: Daren J Farmer/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: Subject: Meter 5097 Daren, Do you know if there should be a deal in place for Midcoast on this meter for January? Currently, it only shows ENA. I understand that a deal was added in December for Midcoast, but that deal was only good for Dec. Thanks.
