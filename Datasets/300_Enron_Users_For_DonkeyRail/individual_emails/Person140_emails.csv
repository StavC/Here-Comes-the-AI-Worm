Subject: RE: LV Cogen Turbine Contracts Jim. Lisa's point is valid. It was confusing to get everything other than technical information for the b/o contract coordinated. ""Others"" had that responsibility. Be that as it may, her questions set before you in her e mail need to be answered. Peter Thompson should get responses to those questions to coordinate and amend into the GE B/O contract, as should Lisa Bills. Her ""general comments"" that follow below are comments that Peter Thompson can incorporate now. I'm not sure if that's clear to everyone. But that is the case (I called Lisa to ask). And, I'd also like to propose that any revision to the B/O contract going forward be clearly defined and tracked with a rev number and date/time so that no confusion exists as to what version is going around. I would also suggest that each revision carry a description of what was added and where the add or change originated. I apologize if it sounds like I'm telling people how to do their job, but we cannot take any more delay to at least having this document shelf - ready to sign when the trigger gets pulled.

"Pursuant to your request, attached please find a clean copy of the most recent draft of the LV Cogen Turbine Agreement (second document below), as well as a blackline (first document below) showing changes to the draft circulated on April 24. This version contains Lisa and Roseann's comments (but for changes to Purchase Amount, Maximum Liability Amount, etc.) as well as your comment to allocate the payments among the 4 Units equally. I have not received confirmation as to whether the April 21 payment was ever made. I have therefore left it in bold. If it has, we can amend the table and reduce the Purchase Amount accordingly. In addition, I have assumed that if there is a Change Order applicable to less than all 4 Units, that the Change Order would specify how future payments are to be allocated. To complete the agreement, we will need to insert the date of execution and Exhibit H-2. I have not distributed this to anyone else.

"I have gone through the Version 3 of the ABB agreement that you forwarded. I have compared it to the other versions and changes I was aware of (the technical areas only). I have attached a red-lined version with edits. Also, here are my notes on each of the changes: Section 5.1 of the Agreement - earlier versions of the Agreement contained the purchase amount here. As I commented by phone, by my calculation the total purchase amount for these two units would be $1,713,000.00, or $856,500.00 each. By my records, the original purchase amount for these units was $782,000.00. A change was made in November 2000 that increased each unit by $49,500.00. Another change in December 2000 increased each unit by $25,000.00. These increase amounts were confirmed by ABB on 11/28/00 and 12/18/00. The Version 3 document eliminates this purchase amount.. However, sections 6.1.2 and 6.1.3 contain amounts of $78,200.00, 10% on the original purchase amount of one unit. Should these values be changed? Exhibit B1: Section 5.1.2 b) and c) - these are revisions requested by the contractor. They are reasonable requests if they can be accommodated by ABB. I don not know if these changes were coordinated directly between the contractor and ABB. Section 9.1 - minimum ambient temperature Minimum ambient temperature should be minus 5 degrees C.

"Hi Pete, There's been a Plan B developed on the LV Co Gen project. We are seriously exploring the possibility of selling the current LV Co Gen turbines to a third party, by selling the equity in a project co which acquires the turbines. Sound familiar? Yes, it is CA Development III, only it is called Salmon somethingorother llc. I anticipate that the most recent version of the LV Co Gen contract will need to be adapted to the CA form - no E Next Generation or ENA as agent. I believe Dale has been working on some tweaks to the form you last worked on for LV Co Gen, and I assume these tweaks belong in the ""new"" Salmon contract. I will forward you the most current form that I've seen, and Dale can protest if he thinks this is the wrong one to work with. Carlos Sole is the lawyer in Houston who will be herding these cats. His number is 713 345 8191. I will be out of the office next week, but will periodically check my voice mail if you have any questions.

"Hi Pete, There's been a Plan B developed on the LV Co Gen project. We are seriously exploring the possibility of selling the current LV Co Gen turbines to a third party, by selling the equity in a project co which acquires the turbines. Sound familiar? Yes, it is CA Development III, only it is called Salmon somethingorother llc. I anticipate that the most recent version of the LV Co Gen contract will need to be adapted to the CA form - no E Next Generation or ENA as agent. I believe Dale has been working on some tweaks to the form you last worked on for LV Co Gen, and I assume these tweaks belong in the ""new"" Salmon contract. I will forward you the most current form that I've seen, and Dale can protest if he thinks this is the wrong one to work with. Carlos Sole is the lawyer in Houston who will be herding these cats.
