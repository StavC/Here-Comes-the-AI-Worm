"Mike, In my opinion Onkyo is just a better quality product than Kenwood, thus the price discrepancy. I (and this is just me) would not buy a Kenwood. I would buy Onkyo, Denon, Yamaha, or Harman Kardon. These are more expensive, but I think better than Sony, Kenwood, JVC, Technics, and Pioneer. The Onkyo 696 is a great receiver. And I know you can beat the Crutchfield price. The sites I would check out are onecall.com, soundcity.com, jandr.com, hifi.com. You also need to look at audioreview.com. You can see other peoples opinions of products they have actually purchased. It is a great site. They will also indicate where they purchased the equipment and how much they paid. On those sites to buy that I mentioned, you need to call and talk to someone. They will give you a better price than advertised on the internet. Give me a call @ 713-853-9573.

Brian, This is an excerpt from an article (attached) that I used to estimate the energy requirements for the new ethanol plants. I thought you might be interested. If you are interested, I can provide you with a complete list of all the plants under construction and a list of planned constructions as well. Jozef Natural Gas . We anticipate that our plant will require a natural gas supply of at least 0.75 billion cubic feet per year at a minimum rate of 100 MCF per hour and at a minimum of 200 psig at the plant site. To access sufficient supplies of natural gas to operate the plant, a connection to a distribution pipeline located underground at our site will be required. We have no current agreement with any third party to construct such a connection. << File: Ethanol EnergyCosts.doc >>",bryant.frihart@enron.com,c..giron@enron.com,"'Lieskovsky, Jozef' : 'person', 'Frihart, Bryant' : 'person', 'Plainview, Nebraska' : 'address', 'Frihart, Bryant' : 'person', 'Lieskovsky, Jozef' : 'person', 'Lieskovsky, Jozef' : 'person', 'Frihart, Bryant' : 'person', 'Jozef' : 'person'",8,FW: Ethanol plant will need gas...,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,received,c..giron@enron.com

I hope good. I just found out that Enron is making Sprint Broadband Direct available to us at a discounted rate. Isn't this the group you are working for now? They will install the equipment for free and charge $24/mo ($14/mo if you sign up for Sprint Long Distance). Do you have this? If so, how do you like it? Did you hear about Jessie? Anyway, I just wanted to ask you about this. I have dial-up now and it really sucks, but I'm a tight-wad and didn't want to pay what DSL costs. Take Care.
