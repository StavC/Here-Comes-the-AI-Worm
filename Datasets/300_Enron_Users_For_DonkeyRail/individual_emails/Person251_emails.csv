"Happy to help with Kristin's week of Doorstep work with EES. I'm glad she will still be in the building/Houston however, because we are all working our tails off up here - plenty of infrastructure work in progress. On that - just a couple of other things to mention. 1. Kim/Leslie decided to keep Ellen W - with a revised/upgraded role - which is good for Ellen. I think Ellen's disappointment was that they told her she was 'good to go' on the Tuesday - and changed their minds on Wednesday - invoking the '12 months' rule. However - Ellen seems over it - and is pleased with her new role. Point to note - it took an external 'inquiry' to make them realise what a potential diamond they had - maybe they may of seen it earlier - just an observation. 2. I'm still a couple of good quality deal capture/documentation people short. I would gladly take any quality candidates you may like to suggest. 3.

His wife has MS in its most severe stages. He was a manager previously, and we jointly made the decision to reclassify him as a senior specialist in order to reduce the expectations on him in his role at work. He needs to be able to leave work at a very reasonable hour each day in order to relieve a caregiver who is with his wife while he works. I made a personnal commitment to him to make sure that his work load would allow a reasonable and predictable end to his work day, and as long as he is in my group I will personally make sure that works for him. I would hope for him that if he ever considered a change that a new boss would be able to do the same. Danny contacted me about Bob, more from the standpoint of asking me what impact it would have on gas if he moved. I suggested that Brent would be better able to address that.

Barry, who will be based in Houston and report functionally to both Jim Fallon and John Echols, will assume responsibility for the on-going day-to-day control and development of EBS's trading support infra-structure.

Barry's responsibilities with regard to Global Trading Support Operations will mirror those of other Controller functions throughout Enron. In this role, Barry will work closely with Sally Beck's Global Risk Management Group to insure that EBS is focused on best practice throughout the front and back office functions, including Risk Book Management, Deal Capture, Contract Administration, Contract Settlements and Trading Accounting. Barry's group will also help ensure operational systems are developed to facilitate the timely and accurate reporting of all trading activities and that key operational procedures and processes are implemented.

"Barry, Thanks for the timely email. I have your name on my list of people to contact this week as Kevin Hannon had mentioned to me just yesterday that our group might be able to help you in translating positions for the new risk system for EBS. You are right that I haven't been spending much time on 44. Martin Lin has been taking the lead in day to day management of most of the current projects that we are supporting. We have been somewhat short handed since Samer Takriti left the group last fall and we were out-bid by McKinsey for Cantekin Dincerler who had helped us with EBS projects as an intern over the summer. However, we do have additional help coming. Iris Mack, a very bright new hire who comes with significant consulting and risk management experience, will be starting with the group next week. I am hoping that, together with Martin, she will allow us to significantly increase the research group presence on 44 and address areas which are currently undersupported. Can I get on your schedule some time next week in order to map out the areas where we could best contribute to the risk management projects and to introduce Iris and Martin to you?

"We are working on the details of Todd's accomodations. I view this as a business trip on which we are allowing him to bring his family. ENA is picking up the cost associated with the family. Sounds as if I need to make sure we moderate expectations on those accomodations, but we will get that handled. That is great that Edith will be in London for part of Todd's stay. Your notes ask for Astros tickets for Wed., April 10th. Monday is actually the 10th; Wednesday is the 12th. The Astros play St. Louis on both of those days., both evening games. I would be happy to give you four tickets for either one of those games. Just let me know whether you actually want the 10th or the 12th. We will definitely plan to get together while you are here in April. I would love to see Jo as well. We will have to work the details. I am planning to be in London next week, arriving the morning of the 20th (Monday) and staying through Thursday, so we should see one another before April. I am working on an agenda right now for next week, so I will be back in touch within the next day or so to confirm some time with you there. --Sally Barry Pearce 03/13/2000 08:37 AM To: Sally Beck/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: Subject: Todd & Things....

"I still agree that this is not the time for promotion to VP. Kristin certainly did an outstanding job in her role within ENA during the first half of the year. I would like to see her develop a broader view across the organization and be able to be more effective in working with others and sharing her knowledge and experience before she is promoted to VP. I guess that the one caveat that I would put out, is to wait and see if there are other names brought forth from other parts of the organization that would make it seem that Kristin should be in that pack. --Sally Barry Pearce @ ENRON COMMUNICATIONS 11/27/2000 06:21 PM To: Sally Beck/HOU/ECT@ECT@ENRON cc: Subject: Re: Kristin Albrecht thanks as we discussed - my feeling is to not promote to VP this time - are you cool with that still? - given that we have no other outstanding candidates for VP in her 'peer group'",sally.beck@enron.com,barry.pearce@enron.com,"'Sally Barry Pearce' : 'person', 'Kristin Albrecht' : 'person'",2,Re: Kristin Albrecht,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,received,barry.pearce@enron.com
