"Hey Joe, Here's the response I got with regards to Tomcat. I've place another call into David and let him know that the information we received included most points except for Tomcat. I'll keep you informed. What I know is that the gas is sourced at MI 587 and moved on KM's firm contract. For as long as CES remembers, they sell the gas to Entex. Entex chooses the pipe off which they take--usually Midcon--also, HPL Channel, or Tejas. KM is invoiced directly. Volume is approx. 2395. The deal with Entex is written up monthly. KM pays on a basket of indices. Entex pays on the highest index.

Duke and Devon met last fall to discuss the imbalance, which according to Devon was approximately 240,000 due to Duke at 8/31/99. Devon acknowledged that an imbalance existed but didn't think it was that high. Both parties seemed to take the position that the other side needed to prove them wrong. According to Duke the imbalance grew by 120,000 in September, 16,000 in October, and another 12,000 in November (all round numbers) bringing the total to approximately 395,000 through the end of November. Based on current month estimates, Duke thinks January sales are 1,000-2,000/day higher than production, and would like to see a cut in sales of 4,000/day effective Friday 1/21/00 in order to balance for the month of January.

Here are some answers to your questions. Waskom is a field in East Texas (Harrison County) where we purchase gas from PennzEnergy at the Bryson C.P. and Jeter #2 wells. The gas is termed up to New Waskom Gas Gathering (NWGG) through June 2001 (the term of the PennzEnergy purchase). We then buy the gas back from NWGG into our Tetco East Texas pool ... also termed up through 6/01. Virginia Field used to be associated with NGPL, but several years ago PennzEnergy worked out a processing arrangement with Corpus Christi Gas Gathering, so the gas is now termed up with CCGM through 6/01 ... priced off of the Houston Ship Channel. Jennings Ranch used to flow into NGPL through a gathering line, but a couple of years ago NGPL sold that line to Midcon Texas, so we now handle it as another Midcon Texas property. Sometimes we sell it at the meter to Midcon Texas (KN), and sometimes we ship it through Midcon to our NGPL South Texas pool. Carthage: Altra picks up their gas in their Cartwheel agreement. The agreement we nominate on is also a cartwheel agreement. It is not much different than a Hub agreement, except it allows title tracking. TGT on the whiteboard refers to Texas Gas ...

Any special transactions that need to be handled via the settlements process 4. Copies of contracts 5.

"Ami, As discussed earlier, the issue is whether all of the Delivery Points appearing on Exhibit C to the 76 Agreement, as amended, are subject to the audit of General Service Customers, or whether the audit should narrow the focus to the Houston, East Texas and Gulf Coast Divisions. Stated differently, the issue is whether quantities of gas required by General Service Customers in the Beaumont Division or the South Texas Division should be considered part of the Basket. Transaction No. 1 - Revision No. 1 under the ENFOLIO Agreement states that the DCQ obligations apply to ""Customer's Houston, East Texas and Gulf Coast Divisions."" Therefore, although this Transaction identifies the Delivery Point(s) as those appearing on Exhibit C to the 76 Agreement, the intent was to exclude Beaumont and South Texas. In an earlier conversation today, Dan Hyvl confirmed that the foregoing was the appropriate analysis of this Transaction. Based on this call, it would appear that, although Exhibit C to the 76 Agreement lists multiple Delivery Points, the intent was to limit the Delivery Point to the Customer group referenced in the heading of the applicable ENFOLIO Agreement. Dan further stated that the boundary lines were redrawn at some time prior to December 29, 1998 (the date of the Restructuring Agreement). We have not seen documentation evidencing these changes. In addition, it was discovered that the ""Texas Coast Division"" (referenced on Exhibit C, as amended) is actually the ""Gulf Coast Division."" Dan mentioned that it would be prudent for all ",jsonnenberg@bracepatt.com,ami.chokshi@enron.com,"'Ami' : 'person', 'Dan Hyvl' : 'person'",2,Exhibit C Delivery Points,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,received,ami.chokshi@enron.com
