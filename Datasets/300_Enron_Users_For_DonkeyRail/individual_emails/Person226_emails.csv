Note the lunch will be delivered at 11:30. Tracy & John, can you arrange the Agenda accordingly and reminder that Eric Gadd will be leaving at 12:00 so his area should be covered before then.

"Danny: Please see your travel itinerary for SGA Conference. Note that Sunday departure was required as no Monday flights would get you in time for conference and were connections (example, American flight departing at 6:10 am with arrival into Palm Beach at 11:50.

"-----Original Message----- From: Corman, Shelley Sent: Wednesday, November 07, 2001 4:07 PM To: Hayslett, Rod Cc: Horton, Stanley; McCarty, Danny Subject: Floor Space Announcement I was very disappointed to not have any advance warning about the announcement that construction on 41 has been put on hold for financial reasons. The Gas Logistics team was ""relocated"" off the 41st floor on October 5. Prior to the move, we had a very efficient, open configuration that let us work together as a unified team. After the move, we are located on 3 different floors. Besides the general impact on team unity, this move also means that our evening staff work alone on separate floors, rather than in a group. It means fewer individuals to cover customer calls. It means having more equipment to cover the day to day business. I have worked hard to calm the team that this arrangement is just temporary and that we will eventually be put back together as a team. Prior to our move I constantly questioned whether our move was necessary. I asked about smaller, more practical changes to fit more people on the floor. And, I specifically asked about whether Enron issues might impact the groups desire to continue to spend $7-$10 million -- even as I reluctantly packed up my boxes. I hope you can appreciate that the current seating arrangement is a serious issue for my team and one that generates constant questions as my staff meetings. Finding out that we moved off of 41 for no reason at an all-employee floor meeting undermines my team's ",danny.mccarty@enron.com,julie.armstrong@enron.com,"'Corman, Shelley' : 'person', 'Hayslett, Rod' : 'person', 'Horton, Stanley' : 'person', 'McCarty, Danny' : 'person'",4,FW: Floor Space Announcement,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,received,julie.armstrong@enron.com
