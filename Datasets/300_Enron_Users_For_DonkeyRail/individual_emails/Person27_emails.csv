"Sorry , I have not given you feedback earlier but I've been on vacation. Randy continues to do an excellent job. He anticipates questions and usually has the answers. He is a very dedicated employee and continues to expand on his knowledge base. He has helped the traders trade the permian and waha points on a daily basis and such commercial experience has proven to be very valuable regarding looking for alternatives to move gas. The only area for improvement that I might suggest would be to challenge others or state his opinion if he has a different opinion from others rather than not say anything or go along with the status quo. He tends to want to be nonconfrontational which is not a bad thing but this is a tough environment and he could get run over if he does not state his opinion.",jane.tholt@enron.com,robert.superty@enron.com,'Randy' : 'person',1,Randy Gay Performance,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,sent,jane.tholt@enron.com

However, I'm not too optimistic about it getting rescheduled for next week.

"Sorry , I have not given you feedback earlier but I've been on vacation. Randy continues to do an excellent job. He anticipates questions and usually has the answers. He is a very dedicated employee and continues to expand on his knowledge base. He has helped the traders trade the permian and waha points on a daily basis and such commercial experience has proven to be very valuable regarding looking for alternatives to move gas. The only area for improvement that I might suggest would be to challenge others or state his opinion if he has a different opinion from others rather than not say anything or go along with the status quo. He tends to want to be nonconfrontational which is not a bad thing but this is a tough environment and he could get run over if he does not state his opinion.",jane.tholt@enron.com,robert.superty@enron.com,'Randy' : 'person',1,Randy Gay Performance,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,sent,jane.tholt@enron.com

"In the final analysis, we did not make a lot of progress in reaching agreement to settle the RP99-507 proceeding on El Paso's capacity allocation proposal at the conference in San Francisco last week. The parties have agreed to proceed on a dual track because of Burlington's concerns about timing. We will reconvene for settlement discussions July 12 and 13 at Southwest Gas's offices in Las Vegas after comments and reply comments are filed as permitted under the procedures agreed to at the May 2 technical conference at FERC. Comments are due June 30 and reply comments on July 7. Amoco and Burlington filed the original complaint on September 21, 1999, and requested fast-track processing under the Commission's new complaint procedures. Burlington is pushing to have the Commission adhere to the fast-track processing of the complaint, maintaining that an order should have been issued within 240 days (I don't know where they got that from -- I can't find any such requirement), and vehemently opposed any attempts to extend the procedural schedule. The tone of the meeting was set when Harvey Morris, representing the CPUC, was allowed to make a statement because he had to leave by 1:30 (the meeting started about 12:30). He started by saying that the CPUC was in complete opposition to the Settlement Proposal circulated by El Paso on June 6, and then outlined all the reasons it was unfair to California shippers and was in violation of the '96 Settlement. After Harvey spoke, El Paso then reviewed its June 6 settlement proposal, which",rebecca.cantrell@enron.com,jane.tholt@enron.com,"'Burlington' : 'person', 'Amoco' : 'person', 'Burlington' : 'person', 'Burlington' : 'person', 'Harvey Morris' : 'person'",5,"El Paso ADR Settlement Conference, June 12-13",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,received,jane.tholt@enron.com

"Jane, I have a few issues with SWG per their email below. 1. SWG says the price on Sitara 518455 (Day 7) should be $9.50 instead of $9.55. If this is correct, could you please change the price in Sitara? 2. On Sitara 386140, SWG says that the trigger amount should be calculated on the physical volume, not the scheduled volume. Can you please let me know which is correct and adjust in Sitara if necessary? Also, SWG will be shorting ENA $198,026.60 for liquidated damages on contract 96003533. Would you like me to fax the backup to Patti Sullivan as I did last month? I have one last question for you on contract 96003533. For November and December gas, SWG is paying on the last day of the month versus the 25th. I checked the contract and it does confirm this information. However, it is my understanding that SWG is a netout customer (they have been receivable only for quite some time). I have checked with contracts and credit and cannot find a netting agreement. Do you know if there is a netting agreement which might override the payment terms on this contract? I have a $2MM dollar invoice with a 1/25 due date that they will not be paying until 1/31.

Would you like me to fax the backup to Patti Sullivan as I did last month? I have one last question for you on contract 96003533. For November and December gas, SWG is paying on the last day of the month versus the 25th. I checked the contract and it does confirm this information. However, it is my understanding that SWG is a netout customer (they have been receivable only for quite some time). I have checked with contracts and credit and cannot find a netting agreement. Do you know if there is a netting agreement which might override the payment terms on this contract? I have a $2MM dollar invoice with a 1/25 due date that they will not be paying until 1/31.
