"Hello Everyone, It is time to get started in our quest to figure out the N.E. Given that we are coming to the end of the heating season our best opportunities to make money over the next little while will be with respect to storage, storage arbitrage, and opportunities surrounding the injection season. Having this in mind I think the best place to start is with the pipe that has the most storage capabilities and flexibility, and I think that is Columbia Gas Transmission. I am inviting everyone to attend a meeting Tuesday at 3:00 (location to follow) to discuss the who, what, where, when, why, and how. In preparation for the meeting we need to have information regarding the pipe: 1) We need the operational capabilities of the pipe. This should include major receipt points, delivery points, through put capability, line pack balances, and storage facilities (both owned by the pipeline as well as third parties). Expect to discuss which regions are the bottle necks, and what operational restrictions or advantages individual locations have. (Rob, Meredith, Bob or Chris could you please try to track down some of this info) 2) We need to talk about trading and transacting in this region. Proper contracts with the pipe, what flexibility we have (or could get), transportation costs within the region, etc....(Rob, Meredith, Bob or Chris could you please try to track down some of this info) 3) Major players on the pipeline LDC's, Industrials, Power Generators, and production companies (i.e.. native production on the pipe) (Adam and Chuck could you please gather this info) 4)",jonathan.mckay@enron.com,"robert.allwein@enron.com, meredith.homco@enron.com, robert.superty@enron.com,

Enron can turn energy usage flexibility into revenue for our customers. When a customer chooses Enron's product, they receive monthly payments in exchange for reducing their energy usage at Enron's request. Requests are made when energy market prices are high, so the energy the customer doesn't use can be sold on the market at a premium. Bad time for the customer? No problem--they can choose not to reduce usage, and pay a ""buy through price"" to Enron instead. Want to learn more?

I will forward this as soon as I receive it. The event in this case is preventative maintenance. It appears that there are stress fractures in certain of Clark's generation equipment. GE is installing equipment to assess the problem. The installation and removal of this equipment will involve an outage totaling 5 days over the next 2 weeks. The question is: Is preventative maintenance a legitimate Force Majeure event under the APEA/Clark contract and thus under the APEA/ENGMC contract?

"Hi Jon, I guess it isn't critical that we see whether the trades are a buy or a sell. The reason that I had requested this was to ensure that I has both sides of the trade but in your case you may be long or short depending on the circumstance. Therefore, if you could just include the Enron trades so that we have an accruate picture of the volume traded by Enron that would fulfill our needs for the pie charts. I understand your concern regarding your position and do not necessarily need this information if there is another way to get to the place we need to be with the pie chart. Unfortunately, I am not in the office on Monday or Tuesday so will not be able to reach you. If you have any further concerns please call me on Wednesday to discuss. Shyla M. Tweet, B. Comm.
