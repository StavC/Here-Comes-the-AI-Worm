"John--Attached is an update of the values in the various transport books as of October 3rd. Please note that the East Desk has already made its changes. All that was done was to move the correlations up--the old percentage and new percentage of each deal is shown on the sheet. I am waiting on a deal by deal breakdown of extrinsic value changes, but I have been told that the change in total for the East Desk was ($5,900,000). They brought this in at the same time they cleared out the $5,700,000 positive that had been withheld, resulting in about a ($200,000) change. Please let me know if you disagree with any of the changes that were made and we will fix them. They really did not seem very controversial since these were all Columbia Gulf transports and the correlations were just set too low. The West Desk's proposal on PGT/Kingsgate is also shown on the worksheet. After speaking with the Canadian office on forward AECO basis, Phillip and Keith believe the Kingsgate / Malin spread should be widened considerably. At this time they are proposing moving the current spread from $.1676 to $.2676, and moving the correlations up to the point that results in a $.0303/MMBtu extrinsic value number. They believe this would put the values in the appropriate places, and would result in very little net impact overall to their books. As of yesterday's close, the impact would be a positive $55,301 change. No changes will be made until you approve it.

"Jeff, here are my questions and comments: Section II. A. Do you think the 2.6 sentence is clear enough--meaning, they couldn't take this to mean they have a 10% daily tolerance on their nomination, just a 10% monthly nomination. Section II.B. 4.1--As discussed, we need to add the words ""LDC or interstate pipeline"" after the word applicable in the third to the last line. Storage section: Need to add a 5% tolerance to their monthly storage nomination. Then, we need to add a mechanism to handle their being off from that first of the month storage nomination. The concept should be this: If they are within 5% of their monthly storage nomination (in the paper pool or bank in Ed McMichael's proposal) but not at exactly 100% of the nomination, this volume variance will be rolled to another month and the proxy schedule amended. The parties must mutually agree to the month the hedges will roll to (protecting us if we have already rolled some hedges for our own benefit), with the financial impact of these hedge changes being borne by CES. If they are outside the 5% monthly nomination, the volume outside the 5% will be handled as follows: If storage takes are less than 95% of the Monthly storage nomination, the volume that falls in this category will be sold to ENA at the lower of (i) the average of the five lowest current month prices as published in Gas Daily for the applicable location; or (ii) the following month's Inside FERC or N",colleen.sullivan@enron.com,jeffrey.hodge@enron.com,"'Jeff' : 'person', 'Ed McMichael' : 'person'",2,"Re: Columbia Energy Services Corporation (""CES"")",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,sent,colleen.sullivan@enron.com

"Per Chris' memo below, it appears to me the question we need to be asking is this: Was this contract number from CES (columbia gulf k#64502) valued in the original deal? Originally Chris was told that this contract was a volumetric FT contract, when in fact it is a 100% demand charge contract. Since it is a deal tied to the Devon production, I don't know how (or if) it was valued by us. Theoretically, we could have taken the difference between the max IT rate (which is what we get to deduct from the producers' price) and the amount of the demand + variable cost of the FT contract and MTM'd $$$. Did we do this? If we did, then I believe we have a true up issue with CES. If we did not value anything, then I think we are O.K. Please advise.

"This is just FYI- I think we really need to ask Dan, Judy and Chris to dedicate some time to map the market area points accurately.

Just so you know, when I print out the market area transport p&l, there are 85 tickets/paths set up, and only 19 of those show a positive p&l. I know that we are not using that much transport that is out of the money--I'm sure this is just a case of no one going in and making sure the mappings for each location in the market area are accurate. I would just go ahead and do this, but I I do not know the market area points and valuations well enough. There are a few simple things I could point out that need fixing (i.e., TCO pool vs TCO citygate--as prices go up and cost of fuel goes up, no one is adjusting the curves between the two points, so your transport starts out in the money and ends up out of the money; another example is CNR--the gathering charge on CNR is now $.44, but we still have our curve set at TCO pool minus $.32.)

"Scott-- Something for you to consider: If the transport people are to have their own books, my belief is that the curve setting used for the transport values ought to be as unbiased as possible. This means using as few ""formula based"" curves as possible and as many Gas Daily publication postings as possible. I'm not sure how you or your traders feel about the following postings, (how realistic they are), but I think they bear watching to see if they could be used for calculating transport p&l. In Gas Daily, under Citygate, Pooling Point Prices, there are Mid Atlantic Citygates postings for both CNG and Columbia Gas. These could potentially be used for CNG North & South Citygates and TCO citygates. The only thing I have to confirm is how these would load since there is no index posted each day--it is a range of prices instead. Historically TCO and CNG citygate postings haven't been much of an issue because we haven't held much transport on CNG and TCO, but with the CES business in our portfolio, the times have changed. Currently we are using ""formula based"" curves set by the traders to calculate CNG and TCO transport p&l, and there sure seems to be a huge difference between the postings and how we are marking the curves. For example, today's Gas Daily postings compared to our curve markings are as follows: GAS DAILY GAS DAILY SPREAD SPREADS per TRADERS CURVES TCO pool $2.985 $1.565 $.10 TCO citygate $4",colleen.sullivan@enron.com,scott.neal@enron.com,'Scott' : 'person',1,Transport formula settles,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,sent,colleen.sullivan@enron.com

"riday July 7, 11:43 am Eastern Time Company Press Release SOURCE: Columbia Gas Transmission Columbia Gas Transmission Files Innovative Capacity Auction Process With FERC FAIRFAX, Va., July 7 /PRNewswire/ -- Continuing its quest to promote creative regulatory policies, Columbia Gas Transmission, a wholly owned subsidiary of Columbia Energy Group, has urged the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to consider an interactive, Internet-based pipeline capacity auction process that enhances Columbia's current open auction process. In a first of its kind filing, Columbia proposes a ``bid/offer'' system for selling capacity similar to on-line natural gas commodity trading systems. The filing was made in response to customer concerns with the current process and is consistent with sentiments expressed in FERC's Order 637, which encourages companies to voluntarily submit ``new and innovative approaches'' to capacity auctions. Since the filing is not required under Order 637, Columbia's proposed auction is separate from Columbia's Order 637 compliance filing made June 15. ``Under the current mechanism, capacity is not always awarded to the party that places the highest value on it,'' said Carl Levander, vice-president of Rates and Regulatory Policy for Columbia Gas Transmission. ``Even though we conduct our current capacity auction over a five-day period, parties often wait until the last 15 minutes to place a bid. Also, since the current process is based on set time periods, customers often call us back after the auction is closed saying they valued the capacity greater than the",scott.neal@enron.com,colleen.sullivan@enron.com,"'FAIRFAX, Va.' : 'postal code', 'Carl Levander' : 'person'",2,transportation markets,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,received,colleen.sullivan@enron.com

"New Power Company is current working on the acquisition of CES' mass market customers. In light of the acquisition, there are issues that surround our relationship with ENA as we step into the supply management agreement. Below are the observations that I have. I would like to get you feedback on these. If necessary, let's get together to discuss the ramifications. 1) We are purchasing customers within only twelve markets. As such, we will only interpret the language of the agreement related to ""existing markets"" as applying to only those twelve markets. For other markets that we conduct business in, we would choose to make a decision on supplier and load management even if it is an LDC identified as an existing market under the agreement. In essence, we see the supply management agreement being bi-furcated since CES is selling C&I to another marketer. 2) My interpretation is that New Power Company will only be on the hook for capacity and storage charges as they apply to mass markets. This would include capacity and/or storage allocations received on CVA, CMD, AGL. In addition, it would include the FSS and SST purchased on COH. It would also include the following transportation agreements: 61822, 61825, 61838, 61990, 64939, 65418, 62164. There are some capacity agreements on TCO for CPA(65041, 65042) and BGE(65108) that were purchased by CES for both C&I and mass markets.

The focus for now should be on putting physical positions in TDS--identifying all issues associated with it, resolve questions on where/how to get the position data, what should be filtered, design of the new screens, etc. Also, for your information--from now on we will be including Jeff Gossett and Russ Severson in our weekly meetings as I believe they can help tremendously with position reporting and how we currently get information from Sitara, CPR, ERMS & TAGG. I will send you all an e-mail on Monday letting you know the time and place of next week's meeting. Normally I want to hold the meetings on Wednesday afternoons; however--next week I may have to move it to Tuesday. I will let you know first thing Monday morning.

"Colleen need your help with this one. Choice is having huge temperature swings causing drastic demand changes. Also, the new Choice SST contract mdq was reduced from 134,000 to 54,000 in April. There are several cold days that are causing ENA to service Choice via IT ($0.05/dkt) and Contract Overruns ($0.21/dkt). Do these charges get passed back to CES? The TCO schedulers are trying to be proactive, by looking at Intraday Temps. Unfortunately, we are having a hard time estimating the actual burn. The CDC posts a forecast, one day before gas flow. CDC does not post intraday temps, we look at the National Weather Service. CDC only posts actuals, once the gas day is ended. Once the gas day is ended, TCO and CDC only allow adjustments on the SST contract as a no-notice storage withdrawal adjustment. Because the burns are increasing during the cold periods, we are overrunning the contracts. Just want to ensure everyone is on the same page before ENA receives TCO's April bill, and CES receives ENA's April bill. I have not discussed this with CES yet, wanted to ensure ENA is on the same page. So far this month: 4/4 IT = 25,589 Overrun = 6000 4/8 IT = 22,226 Overrun = 8000 4/9 IT = 12,404 Overrun = waiting on actuals 4/10 IT = 8,200 Overrun = waiting on actuals Accumulated Estimated Cost IT = $3421 Overrun = $2940 There was",joan.veselack@enron.com,colleen.sullivan@enron.com,'Colleen' : 'person',1,CES contract - Choice Demand Swings in April 2000 - PLEASE READ,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,received,colleen.sullivan@enron.com

"riday July 7, 11:43 am Eastern Time Company Press Release SOURCE: Columbia Gas Transmission Columbia Gas Transmission Files Innovative Capacity Auction Process With FERC FAIRFAX, Va., July 7 /PRNewswire/ -- Continuing its quest to promote creative regulatory policies, Columbia Gas Transmission, a wholly owned subsidiary of Columbia Energy Group, has urged the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to consider an interactive, Internet-based pipeline capacity auction process that enhances Columbia's current open auction process. In a first of its kind filing, Columbia proposes a ``bid/offer'' system for selling capacity similar to on-line natural gas commodity trading systems. The filing was made in response to customer concerns with the current process and is consistent with sentiments expressed in FERC's Order 637, which encourages companies to voluntarily submit ``new and innovative approaches'' to capacity auctions. Since the filing is not required under Order 637, Columbia's proposed auction is separate from Columbia's Order 637 compliance filing made June 15. ``Under the current mechanism, capacity is not always awarded to the party that places the highest value on it,'' said Carl Levander, vice-president of Rates and Regulatory Policy for Columbia Gas Transmission. ``Even though we conduct our current capacity auction over a five-day period, parties often wait until the last 15 minutes to place a bid. Also, since the current process is based on set time periods, customers often call us back after the auction is closed saying they valued the capacity greater than the",scott.neal@enron.com,colleen.sullivan@enron.com,"'FAIRFAX, Va.' : 'postal code', 'Carl Levander' : 'person'",2,transportation markets,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,received,colleen.sullivan@enron.com

"New Power Company is current working on the acquisition of CES' mass market customers. In light of the acquisition, there are issues that surround our relationship with ENA as we step into the supply management agreement. Below are the observations that I have. I would like to get you feedback on these. If necessary, let's get together to discuss the ramifications. 1) We are purchasing customers within only twelve markets. As such, we will only interpret the language of the agreement related to ""existing markets"" as applying to only those twelve markets. For other markets that we conduct business in, we would choose to make a decision on supplier and load management even if it is an LDC identified as an existing market under the agreement. In essence, we see the supply management agreement being bi-furcated since CES is selling C&I to another marketer. 2) My interpretation is that New Power Company will only be on the hook for capacity and storage charges as they apply to mass markets. This would include capacity and/or storage allocations received on CVA, CMD, AGL. In addition, it would include the FSS and SST purchased on COH. It would also include the following transportation agreements: 61822, 61825, 61838, 61990, 64939, 65418, 62164. There are some capacity agreements on TCO for CPA(65041, 65042) and BGE(65108) that were purchased by CES for both C&I and mass markets.

"Colleen, I didn't see the live-update of Gas Daily curves in your meeting notes. Should we add it? Please advise. Thanks Zhiyong -----Original Message----- From: Sullivan, Colleen Sent: Thursday, March 08, 2001 12:41 PM To: Zhiyong Wei/HOU/ECT@ENRON; Husain, Karima; Storey, Geoff Cc: Stephen Stock/HOU/ECT@ENRON; Gossett, Jeffrey; Severson, Russ Subject: REVISED MEETING NOTES Please see the attached revision to the meeting notes. You will see the change indicated in RED under Issue #2, Gas Daily. We want to put this item on HOLD for now because there are more implications to this change that we need to resolve before coding begins. The focus for now should be on putting physical positions in TDS--identifying all issues associated with it, resolve questions on where/how to get the position data, what should be filtered, design of the new screens, etc. Also, for your information--from now on we will be including Jeff Gossett and Russ Severson in our weekly meetings as I believe they can help tremendously with position reporting and how we currently get information from Sitara, CPR, ERMS & TAGG. I will send you all an e-mail on Monday letting you know the time and place of next week's meeting. Normally I want to hold the meetings on Wednesday afternoons; however--next week I may have to move it to Tuesday. I will let you know first thing Monday morning. Let me know if you have any questions or concerns. << File: IT-GT Meeting",zhiyong.wei@enron.com,colleen.sullivan@enron.com,"'Colleen' : 'person', 'Colleen' : 'person', 'Zhiyong Wei' : 'person', 'Husain, Karima' : 'person', 'Storey, Geoff' : 'person', 'Stephen Stock' : 'person', 'Jeff Gossett' : 'person', 'Russ Severson' : 'person'",8,RE: REVISED MEETING NOTES,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,received,colleen.sullivan@enron.com

There is a filtering mechanism for each service by pipeline, time frame and the critical nature of the notices.

"Colleen, thanks for the update - as another part of the nat gas value chain, traded transportation, with and without EOL should be a priority. However, I think we have to ensure that we have rules and procedures accepted by the FERC that will allow the market to work. Jim, can you ensure that Colleen and Julie have the regulatory support needed to ensure that the market gets set up appropriately. Thanks.

I would be happy to meet with you and let you know in more detail what I have been working on, but here is a quick synopsis. We are putting new transportation products out on EOL--this should be ready for December business (assuming Lavo has no objections--I just sent him the information on the product). They are simple products with no computerized interaction between EOL and Sitara or EOL and the pipeline bulletin boards (which we are still required to post through per the pipeline tariffs). Quite honestly, I have no idea how much activity these will generate since each product still has the potential for being ""biddable"" on the pipeline EBBs and there is not an easy solution around that.

"riday July 7, 11:43 am Eastern Time Company Press Release SOURCE: Columbia Gas Transmission Columbia Gas Transmission Files Innovative Capacity Auction Process With FERC FAIRFAX, Va., July 7 /PRNewswire/ -- Continuing its quest to promote creative regulatory policies, Columbia Gas Transmission, a wholly owned subsidiary of Columbia Energy Group, has urged the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to consider an interactive, Internet-based pipeline capacity auction process that enhances Columbia's current open auction process. In a first of its kind filing, Columbia proposes a ``bid/offer'' system for selling capacity similar to on-line natural gas commodity trading systems. The filing was made in response to customer concerns with the current process and is consistent with sentiments expressed in FERC's Order 637, which encourages companies to voluntarily submit ``new and innovative approaches'' to capacity auctions. Since the filing is not required under Order 637, Columbia's proposed auction is separate from Columbia's Order 637 compliance filing made June 15. ``Under the current mechanism, capacity is not always awarded to the party that places the highest value on it,'' said Carl Levander, vice-president of Rates and Regulatory Policy for Columbia Gas Transmission. ``Even though we conduct our current capacity auction over a five-day period, parties often wait until the last 15 minutes to place a bid. Also, since the current process is based on set time periods, customers often call us back after the auction is closed saying they valued the capacity greater than the",scott.neal@enron.com,colleen.sullivan@enron.com,"'FAIRFAX, Va.' : 'postal code', 'Carl Levander' : 'person'",2,transportation markets,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,received,colleen.sullivan@enron.com
