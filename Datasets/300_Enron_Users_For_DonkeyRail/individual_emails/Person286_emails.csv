"Dear Ernesto , Welcome to the pleasure of planning an event for your asshole friends. This has been a long standing tradition that the person that gets sucked or suckered into planning an outing for the group gets bitched at non stop until the event happens. The next step is ""the event"" that will be the turning point of this bitching. There are two outcomes, 1. Everyone has a good time and you will bitch back and it will be lessened to good friendly humor 2. Everyone is pissed b/c they drove 100 miles , they play bad and blame you for picking a bad place to play, they kill you and bury you in a sand trap on the number 12 hole , finish the round and never mention your name again. All I have to say Ernie is good luck on everyone play GOLF well this Sunday. Live the next few days to the fullest , they might be your last.

"I don't see the need to mix franchise and non-franchise on the first round. We're trying to get less confusing - not more. What we do not need is some major change in the draft methodology 2 days before the draft. The system that Kevin initially described is the fairest, least confusing and works fine. The franchise keepers (including me) should pick after those that do not keep anyone. It best simulates the outcome of a non-franchise snake draft. Assuming the franchise keepers retain picks 1 through 5 of a true first round, they would naturally pick last in a second round. This system worked fine last year. Dutch and Jeff have brought up ranking the franchise players instead of a 2nd random drawing for franchise keepers. I would vote for that (even though I would pick last in the 1st round - 28th pick!). There are questions with players that might have been injured part of the year or otherwise, but at least you know exactly where you stand. I believe in using the snake draft and a 2nd drawing for franchise keepers, but I would be fine with ranking the franchise players based on prior year. Jeff Smith is just whining because he kept (potentially) the 10th overall player in Manning and would now potentially has Manning and the 28th pick. This is a large sacrifice, but this is Jeff's fault not the system. Look at the other 4 franchise players - they are all in the top 5 in most draft rankings. Only Smith is complaining.
