"I have reviewed the La Plata Facilities O&O Agreement. Lee, could you please review the same and see if you agree with this assessment? It appears to me that the pigging facilties could qualify as either of the following: Special Services. This would be subject to prior written consent and agreement between the Operator (TW) and the Operating Committee (TW & NWPLRepresentatives). If NWPL agreed, their share of the cost would be in proportion to their ownership interest. If we did obtain their approval, future O&M cost attributable to the pigging facilities could be shared among the owners. (We've agreed to a flat fee for 2000 through 2003 with a 3.5% escalator starting in 2001.) Addition or Expansion. Demonstrate that the pigging will add incremental transmission capacity. We have to give notice to NWPL and they have 60 days to participate. If they participate, they share in the cost at their ownership interest, but they get a share of the incremental capacity at their ownership interest. If they don't indicate a desire to participate in 60 days, we can proceed with the Expansion (without any approval, but also no cost sharing). Also, any incremental O&M associated with an expansion cannot be passed on to any owners not participating in such expansion. I think if we went the Special Services route, we would need to justify the need for these facilities to maintain the integrity and efficiency of the facilities at current levels.

"Along the same lines, we could possibly do an EFBH deal with BRT for a portion of their 80,000/d SJ - EOT deal (DP's to WTX). Again, I'm sure they would argue the obligation to flow warrents a reduction in their rate, but we could look at the economics compared to the cost of facility modifications. Over the last year, BRT hasn't scheduled less than 70,000/d on average under that agreement. -----Original Message----- From: Donoho, Lindy Sent: Wednesday, March 14, 2001 11:03 AM To: Hyatt, Kevin; Harris, Steven Cc: Schoolcraft, Darrell; Frazier, Perry Subject: WT-1 Capacity What if we could contract with Agave under the EFBH Rate Schedule for gas from Red Bluff & Bitter Lakes (located north of WT-1 & south of P-1) to deliveries off the south end of the WTX lateral? Then we could sell westward capacity through WT-1 under Rate Schedule FTS-3. Agave nominates a total of 50,000/d to 60,000/d from these supply sources into the Central Pool, but this gas does not need to flow through WT-1. Maybe Agave's existing 40,000/d East could be done under EFBH (if Agave didn't want to commit to incremental firm), but they would have the obligation to flow - I'm sure they would think that merits a rate adjustment.

Because it does not afford Transwestern an opportunity to pass along these reductions to our upstream parties. When an OFO is issued in the Intraday 2 Cycle, an allocation is passed on to Transwestern through the confirmation process with SoCalGas.

The problem: As you probably remember, several months ago several of us met to discuss the following language in the ROFR portion of Transwestern's tariff: ""if the rate bid exceeds the maximum tariff rate, then the rate will be considered to be the maximum tariff rate,"" and the additional frustrating language ""[a]ll available capacity shall be allocated under these procedures . . .."" At our last meeting, we concluded that probably the best way to ensure that TW could capture the true value of the capacity would be to link the negotiated rate to index prices. However, since this usually involves an unacceptable amount of risk to both the shipper and TW, the marketers haven't done any index-based rates and have no current plans to enter into any such deals. I have been asked by the Commercial Group to revisit this",susan.scott@enron.com,lindy.donoho@enron.com,"'Susan Scott' : 'person', 'Susan Scott' : 'person', 'Drew Fossum' : 'person', 'Maria Pavlou' : 'person'",4,Recourse rate dilemma: the sequel,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,received,lindy.donoho@enron.com

SoCalGas (Dictation Draft from Greg Porter) DICTATION DRAFT FROM GREG PORTER I just spoke with Georgetta Baker, lawyer for SoCalGas, and Rick Miles, FERC's ADR group. We discussed the possibility of mediation based upon both parties representing in pleadings filed in Docket No. RP01-620 (TW Complaint) that both companies were interested in alternate dispute resolution (ADR). After discussing the various types of ADR, we agreed to begin with mediation. Rick Miles will be the mediator. The mediation process that was discussed was an evolutionary one whereby parties would meet in a neutral location to discuss resolution (i.e., settlement) of its claims. Both parties indicated a willingness to settle. Rick Miles will act as a facilitator. Mr. Miles' function will be one of moderating discussions and not evaluative. As the mediation process continues without resolution, Mr. Miles' role will evolve. Later on, if the parties desire, Mr. Miles offered to bring in a FERC staffer that is a subject matter expert to offer his or her views of each party's case.
