"All, The unofficial word on the street is that deal closing is slated for Feb 7 and UBSWenergy launch is Feb 11. Our intention is to launch financial products only for our regions beginning with Summer '02 through Cal '03. As we are successful in signing up counterparties to reach a critical mass, we'll be adding products that are closer to the front of the curve (less correlated to NG.) We need to do this to protect ourselves from ""ambushes"" by single parties when we don't have a critical mass of players that we can lay risk off with. Please note that, as a result, we may ""only"" have a couple of more weeks to play with in terms of studying up and refreshing ourselves on the fundamentals in our respective regions. Therefore, I'd like each of you to fill-in the information listed on the attached document for the region listed by your name. Feel free to use any resources you need (fundies, etc.) and have them finished by next Thurs. (2/7). Someone please nominate yourself to format each paper in the same manner and have them all put together in one binder nice and pretty. Have a goodie.

To that end, she said it's generally not a good idea to file a claim (it goes on our record) unless we know there's damage. So, she suggested that I have a roofer come out and look for possible hail damage and, if there is damage, provide us with his estimate for repair. Then we should file a claim if need be. So, I'm on the lookout for a roofer who will do that for us. If you think we should use Joel, I'll call him.

"Gas and coal article interesting... Indigestion Daniel Fisher, Forbes Magazine, 10.29.01 All those new natural gas-fired electric plants mean more gas demand, right? Maybe not. For natural gas bulls, there was never a surer sign of good times to come than the order book at General Electric Corp. Backlogs in GE's Power Systems group almost tripled to $25 billion in the late 1990s as scores of utilities and freestanding power producers ordered natural gas turbines to supply the nation's growing appetite for electricity. Gas demand had to go up as all those shiny new turbines were connected to the grid. Ah, but there was a flaw in that argument--one that is becoming glaringly clear as the price of gas plunges below $2 per million Btu at the wellhead from as high as $10 last year. (A million Btu of gas equals just about 1,000 cubic feet.) Those new gas plants were supposed to steal business from pollution-spewing coal units, which still supply half the nation's electricity. But in a painstaking study of 788 power plants that supply the bulk of U.S. electricity, Charles Studness, president of Studness Research, found quite the opposite could happen. Studness determined that 79% of the ""new"" electricity supplied to the grid over the past five years came from existing plants, mostly coal-fired units. And there's plenty more where that came from. Studness figures existing coal plants have the potential to increase output by 50 million megawatt-hours a year for the",erik.simpson@enron.com,j..sturm@enron.com,"'Daniel Fisher' : 'person', 'Charles Studness' : 'person'",2,Forbes Article-Gas Fired Power Plants 10-29-01,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,received,j..sturm@enron.com

Negotiations start tomorrow (Wednesday). This will be the first meeting. The second meeting is scheduled for Thursday. After this, a more permanent agenda (meeting times and places) will be established by both sides. The Union has established their list of ""wants"" in preparation for tomorrow's meeting. By Friday the union will have the indications needed if meetings will continue. According to the Union: Midwest is putting out false information which includes: 1) top individuals are on or have been on vacation and 2) that the Union has dropped all grievances. Neither of these statements are true.

The projected February average price is $2.10 per MMBtu at the Henry Hub. * March storage inventories will end at record high levels. Ample gas remains to keep prices low until a rebounding economy and declining supplies can provide a lift. * With return to a normal weather, strong industrial loads will boost overall gas demand slightly over last year's levels. * Diminishing weather-related support and high western storage inventories will drive widening discounts to the Henry Hub in the western producing areas, while weak demand and high storage will limit premiums in the East. **end** Follow above ULR for complete CERA Monthly Briefing (7 printed pages).
