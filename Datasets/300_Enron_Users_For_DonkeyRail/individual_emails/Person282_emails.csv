"Dale --- In answer to you questions: a.) We have traded this directly before and have just looked at it as two individual deals....a baseload purchase at index, and a sale at index plus some number with daily nom flex of zero to whatever is negotiated as the daily max. Example: Sitara deals #246931 and #246926 b.) These would definitely be separate products priced separately. I would expect a 3-day, 5-day, and 10-day product with a different two-way for each. c.) Hopefully the other answers help here. d.) To the extent that the deals are like the ones I mentioned in a.), can they bridge to Sitara (at least the baseload piece)? e.) We'll have to decide at what time the customer would have to give notice (for now let's assume 9:30 am central). The customer can make the nomination daily and would only need to notify us if they/we are going to take the gas under the second part of the deal (the non-baseload). In other words, the default would be zero, unless the customer or Enron (whoever bought the service) nominates by 9:30 am. FYI, the expectation is that there would be 3 products (at this point). The 3-day would naturally be more expensive than the 10-day. If you have any questions, please let me know. I'm hoping, that if we view the product as two separate deals, that will make things much easier system-wise.

"I can't believe you're going to put them outside! 100% of the TIME? That would be soooo difficult to do, I would end up letting them in, I have no discipline when it comes them, with their sweet, sweet faces! I do think you are getting paid back for your lack of understanding for Barbara, it's terrible when those kind of things come back to haunt you. Which house is for sale, John's? Or that woman that never came outside? Did I tell you that they raised my tax value on the Roseland house for 2001 to $231,000...what a joke!!! I#m sure that the purchaser will contest and win, he only paid 190,000 and that is the fair value. Are prices going down in Montrose, what's the problem with the house by you, why isn't it selling? I would love to be able to buy a place that cheap...my land here cost $300,000 US! The house alone here will be another $300,000 when it's finished...incredible. Armin has a small one bedroom apartment that he paid $150,000 US for and we checked into selling it, evidently he bought when prices had peaked...we'd get have that for it if we sell...so I guess we are staying in the landlord business for now.

My family vacation is in July, so we are planning on comig to Houston around the 4th of July and leaving July 18, so either the first part of our trip or the last we have to hook up. Armin's dying for Cafe Adobe!!! And a relaxing vacation. The rest of the year we are here, until Christmas...I want to spend that back in the states (hopefully). I have to tell you what Angus is doing..he cracks me up! He loves to sunbathe, back when we were at the apartment and the sun would come out, he would ask to go outside and sit in a chair on the front porch (of course he would wait until I put a cushion in it). Well here at the office the sun comes in the south window most all day, he loves it. But he has a problem in the morning when it is only shining on the west wall. so each day he goes over to the wall and starts tapping on it with his foot! Like he can bring the sunshine down on the floor to him!!! Then he stares at me to fix it!!! He's so entertaining! So who were you partying with on Tues? What's Greg McClendon up to these days? Does he ever do anything with you or Julie anymore? I never hear about him. Well, back to work for a while!

A small rabbit saw the crow, and asked him, ""Can I also sit like you and do nothing all day long? The crow answered: ""Sure, why not."" So, the rabbit sat on the ground ! below the crow, and rested. All of a sudden, a fox appeared, jumped on the rabbit and ate it. Management Lesson: To be sitting and doing nothing, you must be sitting very, very high up. Lesson Number Two A turkey was chatting with a bull. ""I would love to be able to get to the top of that tree,"" sighed the turkey, ""but I haven't got the energy.",robin.barbe@enron.com,scott.hendrickson@enron.com,"'Robin Barbe' : 'person', 'Chris W.

"So what's happening today? Are you involved in ranking stuff, like Kim? That's all so much fun. I think Armin and I should have a ranking meeting, he would get some low marks in the courteous office behavior..when he gets stressed he turns into...ISOLDE!!!! Maybe if I threaten his bonus he would work to improve that one little imperfection. And of course I need no improvement in ANY catagory, I'm just perfect (I'm sure he will agree..ha ha haaaa). Angus would get the best rating from both of us, he is perfect in our eyes. I think Angus may be in trouble with the workers though...i let him out to do his business while ago and the workers had their lunches sitting out, I'm afraid to ask them if he helped himself to their food...he's really bad about that! He got on my desk one afternoon while Armin and I were outside and dined on some M&M's that were in a cup on my desk...there were only like 5 in the cup and when we came back in, I found one partially licked one on my desk and one on Armin's...of course he was sick that night. We are finally getting warmer wetter again, oops that's weather in english. I was able to take off my coat at lunch time, hopefully tomorrow the thermals can go too. I hope Julie has been having better weather in Prague...but I think not. Have ya'll heard from her? I thought she might call us since she's on the continent...
