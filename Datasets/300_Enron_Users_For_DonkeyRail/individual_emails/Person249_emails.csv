Maybe we can try to hook up one weekend in Houston, if not, I will see before the year is out. PS. Rachel is coming in to town this month and she wants to make sure she gets a chance to see you.

Provided guidance to Virginia on what type of reports would be needed for the Traders along w/ settling up a weekly forum by which she can communicate her issues and results to the traders. ? Helped coordinate a plan of attack on how we would become current on ISO actualizations and on what we would do in the interim. ?

Worked Murray O'neil to provide different reporting units with timely accurate reporting of EPMI's credit position w/ the ISO and PX. ? Provided solutions that helped manage Mid-Marketing expectations with what the group could provide in a timely manner due to our technology constraints. ? Made communication and transfer of knowledge a top priority within the group, which is now paying off dividends.

Subject: MSAP meeting Regarding the meeting on Tuesday - MSAP is the system interface between Stat, Lodestar, HP, and Altra with SAP. Currently we have a contractor monitoring the payment request files against the CSC electronic files, looking for duplicate payments, and sending the files to SAP. He also manages issues that come up with CSC. EES IT is in the process of moving the interface to a SQL server and should be done soon. Since our IT is taking over the system aspects, we need someone permanent to take over the business aspects. Mary Lynne and I were talking about the business functions that go along with monitoring this interface and think it has alot of settlement aspects, which might fit into Murray's world. This meeting is just to talk about the responsibilities, where we think the best place is for it to reside and the transition.",chris.stokley@enron.com,laura.prothro@enron.com,"'Prothro, Laura' : 'person', 'Stokley, Chris' : 'person', 'O'Neil, Murray P.' : 'person', 'Mary Lynne' : 'person'",4,RE: MSAP meeting,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,sent,chris.stokley@enron.com

It seem to go very well, w/ TIm also saying that he had expressed an interest in working in London. He did make sure and state that the London office is the highest cost office in all of Enron, and therefore would probably be the first on to experience layoffs if the economy took a downturn. His thought is that he wants to see if he can get me into something on the floor by mid year, but would support me if I decide to go elsewhere.

"Kimberly, I am more than happy to get this issue resolved, however, this is the first that I have heard about getting a number to the customer by EOB 9/28/01.Here are some of the questions that I have regarding this deal: 1) What index are we settling this contract at. I see that you have both a 10-min Dec price along with an hourly price in the spreadsheet that you sent me. My is that it would be settled at the Dec since that is what the ISO pays at, but I need confirmation that the customer has agreed to this index. 2) Are the prices you have in your spreadsheet settlement quality since the ISO does not publish any changes to their web site that happen after 96hrs. 3) What method are we using to confirm the customers usage other than him sending us a file. 4) When can we expect to get the usage data for Feb.-July 5) Are these spreadsheets the detail behind what was invoiced to the customer. 6) Do you have a copy of the latest contract with this customer that gives the calculation language appropriate to their over-generation. I will get this turned around for you as soon a possible once we get the details ironed out on the process. I understand your urgency in wanting to get this settled as soon as possible and I will make sure that happens going forward. However, I will need your patience on getting this settled for Aug. since I have yet to find a documented process for the proper settlement of this contract.

"After a little more digging, I've found that the deal NYMEX was referring to is the same one we dealt with a month ago. I spoke with Tracy Green, one of our contacts at Avista, and she had been dealing with the same issue all day. Apparently, when Avista first incorrectly reported that we hadn't made a payment, it set off a domino effect of doubts that seems to still be falling. So NYMEX called EDF Mann, our futures clearing broker, today to assure that payment would be made today. Tracy had been speaking with her broker at ABN-AMRO; I had been speaking with ours at Mann; and NYMEX had been communicating through both of these entities to us. I've left a message with John Croddock at NYMEX to discuss this directly with him. His number, if you'd like it for your own purposes, is (212) 299-2146. Other contacts are Tracy Green, Avista, at (509) 495-8535, and Gary (?), ABN, at (212) 859-1212. As far as Avista, ABN, ED&F Mann, and EPMI are considered, the March Palo Verde futures contract has been paid, and paid on time. I'd like to speak with John at NYMEX to tie up any possible loose ends on this. Please let me know if you have any questions or suggestions.

The volumetric totals in one of these two columns is supposed to match the volume in the Settlement Detail file for Charge Type 407. However, I have discovered a couple of (annoying) things in September: In comparing the two columns within the table - For LocationTypes L and C, there is no volumetric difference between the two columns. For LocationType G, there is a volumetric difference of 153.15 (more in the Deviation column than in the Energy column) In comparing IE to the Settlement Statement data - When I use the volumes in the Uninstructed Energy column for all LocationTypes, I have a volumetric difference of 10.52 (less in the IE data). However, when I use the Uninst Energy column for L and C, and the Deviation column for G, I then have a volumetric difference of 142.63 (less in the Settlement Statement Detail data). My question is two- or several-fold: What causes the volumes in the two columns to be different for the G type? I could find no discernable value to make it change anywhere in the data.

Cc: Hughes, Evan; Wood, James; Woodward, Jason Subject: invoicing requirements Murray, Pursuant to our discussion this morning, inclusive in this email are the detail behind a proposed method of invoicing a potential customer. Jim Wood and I discussed a product idea for invoicing the customer based on areas aggregations by congestion zones - as determined by the regional ISO and UDC region, and as define in the contract. This is similar to our current practices of invoicing the customer based on their internal regional alignment. Also, inclusive in the invoice would be an additional charge (when applicable) when the customer's consumption falls below 90% or goes above 110% of their baseline usage. The difference from current practices is that this additional charge (credit) would be assessed to the region and not to an individual site/account for this customer. The question is, can Operations handle this type of billing method and if so, is there a potential additional cost for processing the invoice?

"We have transferred new allocations for Gen and Export Dev based on the changes to the formula that I gave to TJ. Tomorrow we will work on redoing Load Dev using the same formula changes, then we need to finish researching whatever is wrong with Import Deviation and get that one done. Once all four are done and transferred, then we can do the Total 407 part, which will identify remaining dollar variances and allocate that amount to ECTstCA. The code hasn't been fully tested yet, so completion of this part may be delayed until cob Monday. I am finished with September Finals for the non-deviation stuff through the 28th, and will have the last two days done tomorrow morning. I anticipate having all of September completely actualized (for both Preliminary and Final) by cob Tuesday.
