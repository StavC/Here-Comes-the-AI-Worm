"good morning its now official, i registered the team yesterday, and yes we are the Loan Sharks again, so keep those jerseys. however, i still need money from those that havent paid yet. games will start in may and i will get a schedule in late April. what i would like is some feedback on practices. i wont subject you to another survey, but i do want to know if you guys would prefer a weekday or weekend practice. i think sundays work best but if you guys want to do an after work thing then let me know. otherwise sundays it will be. and last but not least, i will be going up to the batting cages at least once a week and i hope to see most of you up there too. take it easy. hartman",chartman@nbsrealtors.com,"eholm@aracnet.com, mark_irwin@beavton.k12.or.us, chris@bram.net,

"Greetings Yes, it is that time of year again. Time to start thinking about another championship season. This is going to be real preliminary, what I need to know is who is interested in playing, then we can get into the gory details. Here though is a basic schedule - Register in mid-February. Season starts in May and we will play 5 games in 5 weeks. Then there is a two week break to make up games. 2nd half starts in July and again 5 games in 5 weeks. The cost is going to be around $50-70 depending on things. Games will be once a week starting anytime between 6:30 and 9:30 or something like that. So, let me know if you want to play or not.

These are the real nice fields and the Pepsi field is marked with Pepsi signs in the outfield. We have played on this field many times. Farragut - is at N. Farragut and N. Kerby (Thomas guide 566 F4). One way to get there is to take I-5 and take the Lombard exit. Head east for a few blocks until you see Kerby then turn north and you cant miss the park.

"Good morning Ok, a few items today. Sorry to those that showed up Saturday for practice and I wasnt there. At 12:30 it was absolutely dumping rain at my house and I just assumed that the field was unplayable and that no one else would want to be out there anyways. So to those brave souls that showed up, I give you my appreciation for your effort and again I apologize for either not calling or showing up myself. Along those lines, tomorrows game has a chance of being rained out. The rainout hotline number to call is 503-823-2233, it is updated after 3 PM. Lastly, I have also made some aerial maps of the parks that we play at this spring. I guess you could say that I have too much time on my hands, but I have access to some cool programs here at work. So hopefully these will help you guys find the parks. See you guys tomorrow, weather permitting. Questions, comments, let me know.

"I was tired of the ""softball"" subject line ok, its been a while since you have heard from me, mostly because i have been out of the office and also out of town. so, without further delay, i need to get some $money$ from you guys so we can get registered. here then is the deal, i need $60 from each of you to cover the fee, game balls, new bats, and fees for a practice field. i also need it fairly quickly, so sorry to pass on my deadlines to you guys, but hey payday is coming up. you can send me a check at home which is chris hartman 4936 SW 60th Place, #2 Portland, OR 97221 or you can call me at home at 503-296-0782 or at work at 503-273-0361 and we can make arrangements. i will come by your house if i have to or if you guys want to meet me downtown for some happy hour we can do that to. whatever it takes, and i will go out of my way to accomodate you. once we are registered, i will then want to find out what people want to do as far as practices go. since last years practices were such a rousing success (the best one had 6 people show up) i want to get your input so we dont waste time or money. and i also want to do some batting cages. anyways i'm getting ahead of myself, just show me the money. and let me know if you have any questions. chris",chartman@nbsrealtors.com,"eholm@aracnet.com, mark_irwin@beavton.k12.or.us, chris@bram.net,

"good morning its now official, i registered the team yesterday, and yes we are the Loan Sharks again, so keep those jerseys. however, i still need money from those that havent paid yet. games will start in may and i will get a schedule in late April. what i would like is some feedback on practices. i wont subject you to another survey, but i do want to know if you guys would prefer a weekday or weekend practice. i think sundays work best but if you guys want to do an after work thing then let me know. otherwise sundays it will be. and last but not least, i will be going up to the batting cages at least once a week and i hope to see most of you up there too. take it easy. hartman",chartman@nbsrealtors.com,"eholm@aracnet.com, mark_irwin@beavton.k12.or.us, chris@bram.net,
