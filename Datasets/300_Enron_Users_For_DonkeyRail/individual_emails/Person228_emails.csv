Britt Whitman at (713) 345-4014. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY ? Multiple MOU Plans Debated ? California State Budget Faces One Last Hurdle Budget There is a small possibility that Sen. Burton will not recess the Senate on Thursday unless the Senate passes the budget that the Assembly passed last night (7-17). However a key Democrat, Sen. Sheila Kuehl, has been is in Italy and is on a 16 hour return flight. No one knows if she has been told to return and without her presence, two Republican votes are still needed to pass any urgency measure for the budget. Kuehl's vote is crucial if they take the bill up on Thursday. MOU Mayhem There are currently three leading MOU plans being resuscitated by the California House and Senate deliberations. Senator Burton is hoping to keep the published schedule and adjourn for a month's recess on Thursday evening. Speaker Hertzberg is reportedly not thrilled with leaving until the Edison issue is resolved. However, rumor is that whether or not they recess on Thursday, their adjournment",twanda.sweet@enron.com,"christopher.calger@enron.com, christian.yoder@enron.com,
