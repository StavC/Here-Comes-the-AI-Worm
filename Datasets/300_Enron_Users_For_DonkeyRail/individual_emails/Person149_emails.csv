"The problem as I see it with respect to a material default argument is that Article 16 re TD&I doesn't set a standard as to how/when such services will be furnished by GE. Does Ex. H-1 set forth such criteria or does it merely describe the types of services furnished? Maybe in Article 16 we could try to put similar timing and cover provisions as found in Article 14 re GE's warranty obligations. As we all know presently TD&I is a touchy subject with all the GTG vendors as a result of record equipment orders and lack of qualified technical reps.

From John's and my perspective, it seems that we should first have an internal call re the consolidation of our assignments from weeks past into Peter's draft contract and then send to GE for their review and follow up call either later this week or next. Steve Swift is OK with this approach. At the moment we seem to be knee deep w/GE and Owner on Arcos and suspect that 9:30 CST (3:30 London time) will be difficult for us to call in.

Does Ex. H-1 set forth such criteria or does it merely describe the types of services furnished? Maybe in Article 16 we could try to put similar timing and cover provisions as found in Article 14 re GE's warranty obligations. As we all know presently TD&I is a touchy subject with all the GTG vendors as a result of record equipment orders and lack of qualified technical reps.

"I was unaware that this was on the table for discussion in World Hunger. My recollection is that Mike Barnas proposed the changes to 20.2 (b), which addresses indemnity for fines and penalties (who can forget the cognizant government?). We agreed to narrow GE's exposure by specifically relating the indemnity obligation to a violation of section 3.8, as opposed to the broader provision in prior contracts.
