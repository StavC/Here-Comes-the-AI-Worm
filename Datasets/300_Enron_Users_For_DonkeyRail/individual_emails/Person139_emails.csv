"Kevin/Paul - Apparently the new/separate curve database will not be copied until Monday 2/4. Therefore, we need to decide who will be responsible for marking curves until such time. Over the last few days our group has attempted to mark curves but has not been able to because the Netco group is still performing this function (in most cases). My suggestion is that Netco employees continue to mark curves until the new database is completed. At that time, there will be two separate processes. The Enron estate process will only be marking curves where we have live (not terminated) positions including vol positions. In the meantime, our group will be focusing on validation of the 11/30 and 12/03 curves as well as any other dates that will be crucial for termination calculation purposes. We will need access to all back-up curve data captured during these time periods. Please let me know if you agree.

PJM East Hub: Summary : Hourly Scalars for East hub were changed, resulting in a ($2.3 million) loss. Reasons : Rob Benson had changed the West hub scalars a few months ago and those scalar changes never got transfered over to the East Hub curves. When the curve management function was moved from excel into the Enpower Curve Management system all the curves derived as a basis off West Hub curves started using the West Hub Scalars. Entergy Back End: Summary : Yesterday, Entergy 05 and beyond curves moved down in the range of $0.50/MWh to $1.65/MWh resulting in a loss of approximately $2.3million (held back because Mike Carson is fixing the curves today) NY Curves: Summary : The onpeak and offpeak curves for NY Zones A, G and J require a thorough clean up especially with regards to the issues that are stated below. The P&L is still to be determined because curves have not been changed. On Peak 1. J-G Spread is marked over G-A Spread starting in Year 2009. 2. J-A Spread blows up year on year, starting in Year 2005. Offpeak 1.

"FYI. Original contract says we charge a peak index component. Somewhere, somehow, somebody appears to want to change to a peak/off-peak split. I cannot believe this.

If the initial deal structure was originally on-peak, it is hard for me to believe that we would change to the split and just give away the $24MM. Are you saying that there was an error in the contract at signing or something else?

I just think that Reliant's management team is ""old school"" and Steve was not being able to effectuate the changes he saw necessary (apparently, they would not even let him trade NG against his positions).

"Kevin & Tim: Last week I spoke to Janet about the probable departure of Sean Holmes from EES Deal Management to EES Europe. Janet discussed several alternatives for Deal Management and asked for my suggestions. My suggestion is as follows: Berney Aucoin would assume oversight of all Retail Power Structurning and Deal Management activities. Initially, keep Deal Management separate under Deb Merrill's direction and Structuring under Edith's direction. DSM, LC, DG would probably need to fall under Berney as well. I would anticipate that the functional separation that currently exists between Deal Managment and Structuring would begin to go away over the next 3 - 6 months as we intersperse our more experienced people and everyone in general gets up the curve. Thus, I would expect that we could merge Deal Managemnt and Strcuturing into one group in the near future. I spoke to Berney and he thinks this makes sense and is up for the job. Edith is still planning to move into a commercial Origination role at year end but I believe we could have a replacement by then. Janet and the EES group have definitely bought into this idea - I think they would like to implement. Janet would expect dual reporting of the Group (to EES and EWS) and I indicated that, if implemented, I did not see a problem and as far as I was concerned nothing would change - Berney reiterated this directly.

The plant is located in PJM - West Hub, one of, if not the most, liquid, transparent and retail friendly supply location. Bring us another deal with legitimate due diligence in PJM - East or Zone J/G and we could attribute some strategic value. We have more than generously valued this generation and it does not interest me from a VAR allocation standpoint or otherwise.. Regarding our role in these generation efforts - I view them as minimal, but it is obvious they see differently. I do not anticipate that our book will acquire generation but I am not sure if we need to staff up to handle this vs. distracting our regional structures with these efforts on an as requested basis.

Specifically, we need to make sure that 1) Legal provides us a detailed gap analysis between contracts (purchase vs. sales), 2) all pricing comes through traditional channels (deal mgmnt/commodity structuring), 3) we know exactly how this is priced in relation to mid-offer, consider residual desk risk and 4) most importantly, we need to know exactly what type of orig. is being anticipated.

"Rogers, Kev wanted me to summarize for you the information that I received from one of the industrials that we have been actively pursuing. TotalFinaElf has about 70MW of ERCOT load at a 85%+ load factor. Doug very aggressively priced these guys due to two things: 1) contact had indicated that he was getting ""low, low 8 heat rate offers"" and 2) our relationship with contact (I used to trade gas at the same bucket shop with their head gas trader). Last week Doug showed them $26.00, load following, +/-10% band, all congestion, all ERCOT pancake charges, et al (T&D only pass through). Evidently that indication by customer wasn't blowing smoke, we ended up ""middle of the pack."" Calpine and Reliant both came in with the same product (converting the heat rate) sub-$25 --- Calpine being the most aggressive. By all indications Calpine is showing 8.2-8.3 heat rates and Reliant 8.3-8.4 at least for this customer. Now whether that translates into equivalent pricing for all low meter, high usage, and high load factor customers we shall soon see given the amount of pricing we have out there. In this case, however, looks like they are willing to give it up on the MTM book to get MWs out the door and have it to trade around real-time in the accrual book next year.

"Our marks are fine (at least through 04 where we occasionally see #'s). I don't think it's appropriate to shut down anything. We need to price the product properly and off-peak needs just as much margin as on-peak given the increase in coal prices and the effects of load growth. Rather than shut down products, increase the price to reflect the current risk in the market. We are chipping away at our off-peak position day by day and we have bought some NYMEX coal. Am I making sense? In addition, I am working with Doug to buy 7x24 from FPL in North Texas (for both desks). We will probably have to pay $3.50-4.00 spread to get 3-5 year 7x24 deal done.

If they want a split then we need to increase the fixed basis. RH -----Original Message----- From: Gahn, Scott Sent: Friday, October 26, 2001 8:29 AM To: Herndon, Rogers Cc: Cross, Edith Subject: Re: OC Contract Question The deal structure was initially all on peak, but migrated to 55/45 on/off peak. That was the split at which the desk wanted all of these deals structured. This was the intent of the deal at contract signing. The contract does not reflect this intent adequately. This has been known and discussed for some time - almost 2 years. But, reorgs and departures have apparently left it unfixed all this time. The last I knew John Wack was working to fix this over a year ago. Let me know if you need anything else.

Cc: Cross, Edith Subject: DASH Signature Kevin - Esith and I will need to get your signature on an unwind transaction today. Basically, we are unwinding two TX sites for Owens Corning. They are currently retail index and wholesale index structures with fixed basis and we allow them to shop prices annually (amazing). They have a better price from Reliant for two years only, but we have told them if they go with Reliant then we unwind the entire deal - our deal is ten years though 9/09. It appears as though the customer (OC) will accept this. The two sites are on our books currently at -$5MM - -$6MM - thus we would be glad to get it off our books. we would keep roughly 50% of the value to cover ""unwind costs, with the rest going to EES Origination.
