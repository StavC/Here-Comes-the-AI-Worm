Answer: They are generally the same; one of the major differences might be firm or interruptible. The standard duration for a short term might be day to day or one month or less and the long term would be any trade over 30 days. In an effort to get started, the ideal contract to utilize would be the ""GISB"" contract, which stands for Gas Industry Standard Board. It's just a standard boiler plate contract that ""the Board"" (comprised of reps from various pipelines, marketing companies, LDC's etc.) put together. It's widely accepted! Just double-check on the firmess of the contract. What is the usual process going from short to longer term contracts? Answer: There is no process, it just depends on what type of trade your end-use customer desires. Can you describe to me in detail what a typical exemplary trade is like?

"Hey girl, Sorry, I received all of your messages, but did not respond, sorry. So little C.J. looks like a ""half-breed"", (that's what you''re trying to say!). Is he cute? I can't wait to see him. Yes, I did talk to Teena yesterday afternoon, she sounded happy. I spoke with Daddy yesterday and told him to sit his butt down and stop trying to go to work, especially if there are no health benefits that he will be losing. Instead of concentrating on that job, I told him to concentrate on his health. He said I was right, and said he was going to seriously consider it. I had to laugh when he said he went to work and fell asleep reading or trying to throw away some paperwork. That was hilarious. Can you imagine the secretary going in and finding ""little bitty"" daddy sitting there asleep. I cracked up. The concert was good, you know those young men ""showed out"". However, the concert was supposed to start at 8 and did not start til 9 and had several acts before them and as a result, did not get out of the concert until 1:15 p.m. I was a tired sister, but it was well worth it.

I deleted the reference to ""must pay within 5 business days"" added to paragraph 3. If Enron does make a demand under this guaranty, there is no way we can make payment within those 5 days (especially since we will need to rely on an outside party to provide data to us). As you know, however, when we receive a demand under a guaranty, we move quickly to verify the request and make payments where appropriate. I completed the information in paragraph 4(a). I deleted the second copy of the reps and warranties of corporate authority. Finally, I reinserted ""excluding choice of law provisions . . . "" language to try to keep the case under Texas law, assuming a dispute ever arises. All told, most of the changes look fine. Thanks.
