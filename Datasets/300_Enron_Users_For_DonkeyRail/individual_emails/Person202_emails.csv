"Dear Frank, Many thanks for helping out on this. Should be pretty straight forward I think because it is not a ""new"" product so much as a slightly revised version of an existing product (US WTI). There has also been a development which makes it even simpler. At first the product was going to be WTI (which is usually in USD and barrels) in JPY and kiloliters but apparently EOL have said kiloliters wont actually work so the only twist is that this product will be in yen and not USD. I have therefore amended the documents I sent yesterday (so I hope you haven't looked at them yet ...) to take the barrel / KL conversion language out (and to remove the glitch from the Business Day definition in the GTCs). Accordingly, this email is exhaustive and you can ignore the one I sent yesterday (which was at the bottom of Alan's email to me). I am attaching a number of documents. (i) The first is an internal memo re two new products Enron Japan wants to put on EOL. The Enron CP will be ENA which is why I need your help before going to Mark. The memo describes the product generally and how it will work (and sets out the background as to why EJ is pushing this initiative). This is FYI only. (ii) & (iii) These are the (ii) draft product descriptions and (iii) GTCs and we need ENA legal sign off re same.

"Dear John, Jonathan and I met with IBJ today to try and push our negotiations through to the end. They are still unwilling to do a CSA with us but very significantly their back / mid office is currently looking at getting systems support in place which would permit them to do a CSA with us in due course. They acknowledged to us of their own volition that the market trend is towards CSAs even in transactions where the counter party is not a bank. They did say though that it would be a few months before they would be set up to do so. Pls note that they did not agree to do a CSA with us as soon as they are set up to do so but they now know we will come knocking at some stage to ask them to do it so I think we have gone as far as we can on this for now. We will therefore move forward on the credit matrix in the meantime, if you are still willing to do so. The bank has a credit rating of A, so I guess this means US$15 million credit limit. On the assumption that it is possible to draft these terms into a contract without a full CSA, I wonder who is best to do this drafting. I should be able to do the negotiations but I am not sure that I am able to do the drafting .... Alan, do you have any suggestions? Most of the other issues are sorted now but they still want to change the ""Threshold Amount"" definition to US$10 million. Is there any flexibility on this? Thanks.

"This is a forward power contract. It is actually a one-off contract so no master agreement (and no CSA at least at the moment). It's an option arrangement whereby we have an option for each of four years (years 2-5 of the deal) to supply power at preagreed terms. We pay the option premium during year one by means of a rebate to the customer of a fixed % of their electricity costs. I guess we just have to include additional provisions to the agreement covering the various credit issues which need to be dealt with, but I am not quite sure where to start in a stand alone agreement situation. Sorry about this. Thanks. Ps. We are under enormous pressure to get this deal done ASAP and in any case by Christmas - this is the first forward power deal we will actually sign.

We are almost done - with our office opening and all the other Enron things which have been going on over the last week together with the Japan ISDA seminar series - all parties got a bit distracted ... but just a few more questions I think. 1. When we spoke over the phone some time ago, you noted that there is no submission to jurisdiction clause in the draft we used and were going to check with Mark H. whether this was because we were happy to have exclusive NY jurisdiction. I wonder what you think about his now, do we need to make an amendment before we finalize the agreement? 2.

"Dear John, Jonathan and I met with IBJ today to try and push our negotiations through to the end. They are still unwilling to do a CSA with us but very significantly their back / mid office is currently looking at getting systems support in place which would permit them to do a CSA with us in due course. They acknowledged to us of their own volition that the market trend is towards CSAs even in transactions where the counter party is not a bank. They did say though that it would be a few months before they would be set up to do so. Pls note that they did not agree to do a CSA with us as soon as they are set up to do so but they now know we will come knocking at some stage to ask them to do it so I think we have gone as far as we can on this for now. We will therefore move forward on the credit matrix in the meantime, if you are still willing to do so. The bank has a credit rating of A, so I guess this means US$15 million credit limit. On the assumption that it is possible to draft these terms into a contract without a full CSA, I wonder who is best to do this drafting. I should be able to do the negotiations but I am not sure that I am able to do the drafting .... Alan, do you have any suggestions?

"Sorry, a fairly basic question. Background: We have two legal entities here in Japan, Enron Japan Corp. (""EJC"") and Enron Japan Marketing Corp. (""EJMC""). EJMC is used just for physical trades for reasons of US tax. The draft ISDA schedule we are working on lists EJC as the Enron trading entity. I am still checking how the lumber, oil and pulp trades will be settled but even if they are all to be settled physically, at some stage we may want to do financially settled trades with IBJ in which case EJC will be the relevant entity.

"Dear John (and Sara this is a follow-up from my email to you of this morning our time), I think Morten-Eric is planning to call you again tomorrow morning and he may mention this but I am still trying to work out the best way to move forward on this. I have also today spoken with David Minns to see if he has done anything like this before. Having today had a closer look at the provisions you included and especially the three at the end (outstanding swap transactions, swaps to roll up under new master and credit provision of master to govern), I am a bit confused. Morten did say that you had said that these could be deleted but I wanted to make sure we were on the same track. In simple terms, this transaction with Nippon Chemi-con is a simple stand alone agreement to supply physical power. (There is not even an option for financial settlement in this one - although there will be in later ones). From the credit terms you have proposed I wonder whether you are thinking that we need a credit support annex or something similar because it will not be enough just to put in those terms you have included, additional provisions will be required so that those terms can work (and we don't have a master so we don't already have any of those). If so, I guess we need to link a CSA into the power contract. If Sara has done this before or can email me something along these lines I am very happy to have a go at it. If on the other hand this is less of an ISDA related issue (which I am starting to ",jane.mcbride@enron.com,john.suttle@enron.com,"'John' : 'person', 'Sara' : 'person', 'email' : 'email', 'Morten-Eric' : 'person', 'David Minns' : 'person', 'Sara' : 'person', 'email' : 'email'",7,Re: credit for Nippon Chemi-con,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,sent,jane.mcbride@enron.com
"Dear Sara, ... yes we are still going on this - I hope you had a nice holiday in California after the Legal Conference. I really enjoyed meeting and chatting with you on the Thursday evening. We are almost done - with our office opening and all the other Enron things which have been going on over the last week together with the Japan ISDA seminar series - all parties got a bit distracted ... but just a few more questions I think. 1. When we spoke over the phone some time ago, you noted that there is no submission to jurisdiction clause in the draft we used and were going to check with Mark H. whether this was because we were happy to have exclusive NY jurisdiction. I wonder what you think about his now, do we need to make an amendment before we finalize the agreement? 2. You were going to check the Waiver of Jury Trial provision they want to include against Enron's form of clause. Was it OK? Thanks Sara. Jane Jane McBride Senior Legal Counsel Enron Japan Corp.

"Dear John, I spoke with Sara this morning and she is going to speak with you again and send me some suggested language. I am a bit confused though and wonder if you can explain. When I first mentioned this to the bank I told them that as (if) their credit rating went down, their credit limit would drop (so by implication there would not necessarily be any event of default). Is this the case or would a drop in their credit rating from ""A"" automatically trigger an event of default. The former will of course make it much easier to sell them our proposal (involving us having the option to post collateral before there can be an event of default). Sorry if I sound a bit vague but this is all still a bit new to me. Secondly, we now have their replies to our comments on the various outstanding issues and I will forward these to you now for your input (including on the threshold amount point).

Email contact was difficult whilst I was travelling. Let me give you some observations that hopefully may assist. All you have to look at are two things; Any Japanese legal restrictions on the potential counterparty trading with Enron Japan Any Japanese legal restrictions on the types of products a Japanese incorporated counterparty may trade. As far a restrictions specific to a non-Japanese product then that is the responsibility of the lawyer in the relevant jurisdiction. For example if there are restrictions under Australian law on a Japanese company trading through EOL with Enron Australia Finance Pty Ltd for Australian power then that is my concern.

"Initial thoughts - Can we use Enron Australia as the counterparty to avoid these issues for now, and then when a book has been established assign all the positions to Enron Japan? Can we get (or maybe give?) the rep if we soften it a bit by taking out the word ""ordinary"" or maybe the entire phrase ""in the ordinary course of its business""? Is there a government agency that can give us an opinion or ""no action"" type of letter to give us some comfort that we are OK? It may not be quick enough to get us through this trade but it might open the door for future business. If the end result is that there is no adequate fix and local counsel advises that we are taking significant potential criminal liability, I would think that both parties would be willing to agree to unwind the trade. If necessary, my suggestion would be to raise the potential for criminal sanctions issue to Mark H. (What are the potential sanctions?)

"Jane: Typically, we have been widely successful in convincing counterpaties (wherever located) to agree to either NY or English law to govern ISDA's because NY and England have well developed bodies of financial law and the courts are more likely to understand derivatives transactions. I also have understood from Terry Taneka at IBJ (and an ISDA director) that Japanese financial institutions regularly agree to NY and English law. I realize here we are talking about a Japanese insurance company counterparty. I think, in this instance, it is ok to agree to Japanese law and courts to get this first Japanese Weather deal documented, but I would like for us to strongly reserve with this company the right to discuss further the choice of law/jurisdiction since I presume we will be negotiating a Master Agreement with them. Also, the submission to jurisdiction clause should be non-exclusive. My previous understanding from Jeremy Pitts of B&M was that ISDA's (and the subject derivative transaction) are enforceable under Japanese law (and that netting is also generally enforceable). I also have understood from B&M that Japanese courts are very preferable to Japanese arbitrations. Please confirm these points with Jeremy before finalizing the document. We will need to finalize our thoughts about the markets we are trying to develop and what the best approach should be to choice of law/jurisdiction going forward. This would be a good topic for Mark E., David, you and I to discuss at our first group meeting.

"Jane, - could you let me know what the Japanese lawyers think of John's argument that this deal is to hedge weather risk arising in the ordinary course of our Japanese business. Seems to me that we honestly believe this to be the case, even though it is too early in the development of our Japanese business to prove it today. Perhaps we should change ""arising"" to ""which will arise""? Does that help? - if that is not a runner, all Mark Taylor's suggestions seemed eminently sensible. Do those work? How about booking the deal from Australia? Tax issues? Does where the deal is booked override the fact that the telephone call was made within Japan? - if none of these work, then cancelling the deal (even if the counterparty is willing) must be the least attractive answer as it is effectively acknowledging fundamental (possibly insuperable) regulatory issues with the weather derivatives trading in Japan. - the other things I would want to understand before reaching a decision would be: - how have other derivatives traders in Japan dealt with this issue? (I presume this is not a problem unique to weather and must have been addressed before in Japan as it has in most other jurisdictions) - how grey an area is this? If we take a reasonable position in this grey area, how real is the risk of both the grey area being resolved against us and criminal sanctions then being invoked against us? - following up on Mark's idea, could we not reduce the (hopefully already minimal) risk",mark.evans@enron.com,jane.mcbride@enron.com,"'Jane' : 'person', 'John' : 'person', 'Mark Taylor' : 'person', 'telephone call' : 'phone number'",4,Re: ...

"Based on Ed's e-mail, given that Darren Delage will be in the Tokyo office entering into trades, we should pursue a back-to-back trading arrangement. That is, Darren would be working for Enron Japan (""EJ"") and would enter into the trades for EJ as principal. Then, EJ would enter into mirror trades with ENA. The tax issue then is a transfer pricing issue. Ed previously advised that the margin should be based on a profit-split method. In his June 23rd memo, he advised: ""Such a profit split would likely be along the lines of the various profit split methods that have been used to allocate profits among branches or local entities of banks and financial institutions that engage in global trading operations. As we expect you are aware from experience in other jurisdictions, there is no clearly agreed upon set of factors to use in profit splits for global trading operations, but typical profit split factors employed have been trader compensation, back office compensation, a location or value factor, and perhaps a risk or capital factor. If our sense is correct that a profit split would ultimately be determined to be the appropriate price method, this could entail a substantial effort to make the necessary functional analysis to develop the profit split. These are initial impressions only and, on your request, we can evaluate the appropriate pricing method for the Japan financial trader operation in detail.""

"Initial thoughts - Can we use Enron Australia as the counterparty to avoid these issues for now, and then when a book has been established assign all the positions to Enron Japan? Can we get (or maybe give?) the rep if we soften it a bit by taking out the word ""ordinary"" or maybe the entire phrase ""in the ordinary course of its business""? Is there a government agency that can give us an opinion or ""no action"" type of letter to give us some comfort that we are OK? It may not be quick enough to get us through this trade but it might open the door for future business. If the end result is that there is no adequate fix and local counsel advises that we are taking significant potential criminal liability, I would think that both parties would be willing to agree to unwind the trade.

"Jane: If you have time in the morning (Nov. 9 Tokyo), I would like to discuss ENA's view of the CSA/Schedule relationship. In a nutshell, we provide that a ratings downgrade is an Additional Event of Default in the Schedule (normally a MAC in the CSA). John's preferance, of course, would be a unilateral event triggering an IBJ default (which I am sure would be difficult to negotiate). I am not certain of the time difference but perhaps you could call me at the office after 4 pm (Nov.8 in Houston) and I could then conference in John. Alternatively, please feel free to contact me at home (after 7 pm Houston time on Nov. 8) at 713-664-3207. I look forward to hearing from you. Regards.

"Jane: Typically, we have been widely successful in convincing counterpaties (wherever located) to agree to either NY or English law to govern ISDA's because NY and England have well developed bodies of financial law and the courts are more likely to understand derivatives transactions. I also have understood from Terry Taneka at IBJ (and an ISDA director) that Japanese financial institutions regularly agree to NY and English law. I realize here we are talking about a Japanese insurance company counterparty. I think, in this instance, it is ok to agree to Japanese law and courts to get this first Japanese Weather deal documented, but I would like for us to strongly reserve with this company the right to discuss further the choice of law/jurisdiction since I presume we will be negotiating a Master Agreement with them. Also, the submission to jurisdiction clause should be non-exclusive. My previous understanding from Jeremy Pitts of B&M was that ISDA's (and the subject derivative transaction) are enforceable under Japanese law (and that netting is also generally enforceable). I also have understood from B&M that Japanese courts are very preferable to Japanese arbitrations. Please confirm these points with Jeremy before finalizing the document. We will need to finalize our thoughts about the markets we are trying to develop and what the best approach should be to choice of law/jurisdiction going forward. This would be a good topic for Mark E., David, you and I to discuss at our first group meeting.

"Jane, - could you let me know what the Japanese lawyers think of John's argument that this deal is to hedge weather risk arising in the ordinary course of our Japanese business. Seems to me that we honestly believe this to be the case, even though it is too early in the development of our Japanese business to prove it today. Perhaps we should change ""arising"" to ""which will arise""? Does that help? - if that is not a runner, all Mark Taylor's suggestions seemed eminently sensible. Do those work? How about booking the deal from Australia? Tax issues? Does where the deal is booked override the fact that the telephone call was made within Japan? - if none of these work, then cancelling the deal (even if the counterparty is willing) must be the least attractive answer as it is effectively acknowledging fundamental (possibly insuperable) regulatory issues with the weather derivatives trading in Japan. - the other things I would want to understand before reaching a decision would be: - how have other derivatives traders in Japan dealt with this issue? (I presume this is not a problem unique to weather and must have been addressed before in Japan as it has in most other jurisdictions) - how grey an area is this? If we take a reasonable position in this grey area, how real is the risk of both the grey area being resolved against us and criminal sanctions then being invoked against us? - following up on Mark's idea, could we not reduce the (hopefully already minimal) risk",mark.evans@enron.com,jane.mcbride@enron.com,"'Jane' : 'person', 'John' : 'person', 'Mark Taylor' : 'person', 'telephone call' : 'phone number'",4,Re: ...
