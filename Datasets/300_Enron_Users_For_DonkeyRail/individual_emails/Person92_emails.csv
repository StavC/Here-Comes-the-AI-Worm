"The following comes to mind: Describe the inputs to VAR and the sources of the inputs Discuss Enron's timing of running the VAR calculation Explain the diversification effect Explain that only Officialized books are included in the VAR calculation Explain how Enron uses the VAR for risk measurement, portfolio performance analysis, individual trader analysis Address Risk Policy limits related to VAR A comparison of Enron's risk appetite, measured in VAR, vs. other financial companies would be interesting How does Enron'e use of VAR as a risk measurement tool compare with our competitors? Explain why the VAR engine would have different positions than our benchmark reports.

"Due to the 4th of July holiday, we have an unusual quarter-end situation on our hands. Here are some of the facts: Enron in Houston is closed on both Monday and Tuesday, July 3rd and 4th. The NYMEX is closed both days as well. Equity markets are closed on Tuesday, July 4th but are open on Monday, July 3rd. Enron Europe is open for business on both days. Technically, the first work day following the month-end is Wednesday, July 5th for the Houston office. Given the facts above, the following will be the month-end process: QUARTER-END PROCESS: Final quarter-end information is due to my team by 5 PM on Wednesday, July 5th. No adjustments < $250,000 will be processed after 5 PM on Wednesday. Adjustments > $250,000 require approval from John Lavorato or John Sherriff. A final DPR for the quarter ended June 30, 2000 will be issued by approximately noon on Thursday, July 6. JULY DPR REPORTING: NO DPR will be issued dated July 3, 2000. For divisions reporting P&L for July 3rd and/or July 4th, a ""Special DPR"" will be issued on July 5th. This ""Special DPR"" will not have a year-to-date column. This is due to the fact that quarter-end information will not be completed prior to issuing the ""Special DPR"".

This is causing you to manually adjust the Gas BM report. Is this for all spreadsheet positions? Some of them? Is the variance significant? Is it off everyday? What do you mean by "" All Transport Models"". Does this mean positions? Are transport positions on the Gas BM report? Are they manual adjustments? Are they in GRMS? Can we capture these with spreadsheets? What is your current methodology in preparing the Gas BM report for roll-offs? Is it currently consistent across all regions or is it handled differently by different traders? Please explain this in further detail. The Basis roll-off was done in the GRMS system in the past. Is this still the case? If not, we need to capture these roll-off adjustments using spreadsheets? Can we make the Fixed Price Canadian Deals adjustments using spreadsheets that can be captured in GRMS? Also, what is the status of capturing IM-Canada positions in the system?

"Dear Mike, As we discussed, you will be heavily involved in constructing and implementing global standards and global reporting. This is a strategic initative requested by the commercial teams as well as Causey. This absolutely must be in place by the end of the year. Essentially, there are three main areas: develop global (minimum) standards develop & implement exception reporting to these standards develop & implement global operation reporting I have put together milestones for us to work by in these projects: Global operating performance This will be the monthly reporting package. Currently we do this for N. America. We need to establish a reporting format for the products/locations currently not included in this package. The package is not intended to be incorporated into the current package, but use it as a guide to create our own. Timeline: Aug 31 - Finalize what will be reported Sept 15 - Finalize reporting lines (who we are getting this info from @ each location and who is receiving and consolidating it) Sept 30 - Close of business for sept 30 we should have our first consolidated reporting package to report Oct 30 - Collect feedback from 1st reporting package and redesign reporting if necessary (continual improvements) Global standards time line (daily reporting) This will be the exception reporting based on the global standards we create. This will be a daily reporting package. Timeline: August 31 - finalize global standards into 2 buckets Quantitative (to be reported daily) Qualitative (to be reviewed within doorstep reviews) Sept 15 - Establish measurable targets for quantitative standards Sept 30 - Finalize reporting format",shona.wilson@enron.com,michael.moscoso@enron.com,'Mike' : 'person',1,timeline for global standards & global reporting implementation,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,received,michael.moscoso@enron.com

"Mike, The reason my mistake was not caught on the benchmark signoff procedure is that the postid in question did not have a net position. The procedure Rahmann showed you is where we check GERMS positions to the position reports we run using Excel queries. If a postid has a net position and is not officialized, it will be caught using this procedure. It will not, however, if the postid does not have a position. I understand the importance of officializing postid's, as does the entire West desk. Thanks.
