If the new business opportunity receives approval from EES management, we see the need to retain outside counsel experienced in internet/web based issues. Presently this need would be with the web, structuring, IP, and antitrust areas. In an effort to find a firm that Enron has used recently for web related matters, I spoke with Mark Taylor and Marianne Castano. For Enron Online development, Mark used Sullivan and Cromwell and Milbank, Tweed for the web/trading effort and V & E for IP matters, For a recent EES internet project Marianne used Vivian Polak of LeBeouf Lamb for web/transactional issues and V & E for IP matters. She was very pleased with Vivian's support. After discussing our specific requirements with Mark and Marianne and reviewing this matter with Vicki Sharp, I spoke with Vivian briefly to confirm if she had the experience we needed.

"The very first time that I laid eyes on Steve Susman , he was clad only in his underwear. Moreover, he was shouting and angrily brandishing his fist at me! The Northern Lights may have seen stranger sights, but I assure you I have not. In 1968 or 1969 (you will understand that I have repressed the actual date), I journeyed to Fort Worth, Texas as a representative of the Texas Law Review to attend some State Bar of Texas committee meeting, one being held, I think, in conjunction with an annual meeting of the Bar. The Law Review had reserved a few rooms at one of the downtown hotels. I arrived late at night, dutifully registered at the hotel's desk, received my room key, took the elevator to the designated floor, walked to my room, inserted the room key, and opened the door. The darkness that shrouded the room was suddenly pierced by a flare of light that revealed to my astonished eyes a bear of a man, almost naked, leaping out of the bed toward me, shaking a very large fist in the vicinity of my face, and demanding to know why I had violated the sanctity of his room! It will surprise none who know Steve to learn that although he was adamantly insisting on an explanation, he refused to be quiet long enough for me to offer him one. Knowing even at my then tender young age a madman when I see one, I exited the scene of the controversy with as much speed as my terrified legs could muster and",james.derrick@enron.com,rwright@wt.net,"'Steve Susman' : 'person', 'Fort Worth, Texas' : 'address'",2,Steve Susman,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,sent,james.derrick@enron.com
"-----Original Message----- From: Armogida, Jim Sent: Thursday, November 15, 2001 11:38 AM To: Butts, Bob; Derrick Jr., James Subject: stock options----application of the conversion ratio to existing options appears incorrect Importance: High Bob--in reviewing the Merger Q & A dated Nov 9 in ""Enron Updates"", I think there has been a typo or a misunderstanding on whoever put together the ""Answers"" about how options will be converted. The existing Answer as to how options will be converted is as follows: ""The number of options will be converted on the same ratio as outstanding shares are converted. Your number of Enron options will be multiplied by 0.2685 to calculate the number of Dynegy options at close. At the closing of the merger, the strike price on your Enron options will be divided (sic) by the merger ratio 0.2685 to determine the strike price of the new Dynegy options."" I believe the strike price should be multiplied by the merger ratio [or at the very least stay the same]. If it is done the way the current ""Answer"" suggests, Enron option holders take a double hit---the shares they have options on are reduced by three quarters and the strike prices [which were already under water] get multiplied by four. I would guess that application of the current ""Answer"" totally eliminates all existing options, as a practical matter. I'm pretty sure I am right. Have the Answer people made a typo or misunderstood how conversion is to take place, or is there a problem with the existing merger",james.derrick@enron.com,"legal <.schuler@enron.com>, mary.joyce@enron.com","'Armogida, Jim' : 'person', 'Butts, Bob' : 'person', 'Derrick Jr.' : 'person', 'Bob' : 'person'",4,"FW: stock options----application of the conversion ratio to

"The very first time that I laid eyes on Steve Susman , he was clad only in his underwear. Moreover, he was shouting and angrily brandishing his fist at me! The Northern Lights may have seen stranger sights, but I assure you I have not. In 1968 or 1969 (you will understand that I have repressed the actual date), I journeyed to Fort Worth, Texas as a representative of the Texas Law Review to attend some State Bar of Texas committee meeting, one being held, I think, in conjunction with an annual meeting of the Bar. The Law Review had reserved a few rooms at one of the downtown hotels. I arrived late at night, dutifully registered at the hotel's desk, received my room key, took the elevator to the designated floor, walked to my room, inserted the room key, and opened the door. The darkness that shrouded the room was suddenly pierced by a flare of light that revealed to my astonished eyes a bear of a man, almost naked, leaping out of the bed toward me, shaking a very large fist in the vicinity of my face, and demanding to know why I had violated the sanctity of his room! It will surprise none who know Steve to learn that although he was adamantly insisting on an explanation, he refused to be quiet long enough for me to offer him one.

They understand that Enron has already retained counsel but are interested in any related representation of officers, directors, affiliates, etc. I told them that I didn't think there was likely to be any opportunity for them at this point, but at Rob's suggestion I thought I would check with you to see if it would be useful for them to contact you.

"Dear Sir: My understanding is that Mr. Rick Bergsieker and you are the only directors of Enron Middle East, Ltd., and that Mr. Darrin Donegan is the current local manager of this company. I also understand that Mr. Bergsieker is not with Enron any more, Enron Middle East is still solvent, and it has very limited indebtedness, other than my outstanding expense claims. PLEASE READ ON. I was an employee of Enron from 9 September 1999 to 5 December 2001 and from 1 February 2001 to the end, my Enron employer was Enron Middle East. During this time, I incurred business related expenses with the prior knowledge and approval of my supervisors totaling US$90,000. I have duly filed and had approved these expense claims, but unfortunately have not received the reimbursement yet. Mr. Clay Harris was my last boss and he is still with Enron (clay.harris@enron.com, EGM LNG team, London). Ms. Kim Hickok (kim.hickok@enron.com) is the current EGM HR person and has the full documentation relating to the claim. PLEASE READ ON. Albeit very limited, Enron Middle East does have some assets. I plead with you to instruct Mr. Donegan to sell Enron Middle East's assets reimburse my pre-agreed, appropriately lodged, and duly approved expense claims, whose non-payment has been ruinous for my family. I thank you for your help at these difficult times.

The CPUC has not said when a new meeting would be held. Although we continue to keep the pressure on, the CPUC vote could be for DA suspension as of July 1. We need to be prepared to take immediate legal action in that event. Here is the plan and what we'd like from customers. Within a few hours of a CPUC vote, we plan to file at the CPUC for an emergency stay and request for rehearing. As part of that filing, we would need to include all of the points we would raise in the court and declarations from each individual aggrieved party. The decalarations would be held completely confidential by the attorney, transmitted directly through our outside attorney and would be filed under protective seal at the Commission.

The parties reached agreement in principle on the open issues (the owner dropped its claims against EECC, EECC relinquished two smaller claims, the Owner will pay EECC's remaining claims). Bracewell's analysis of the claims was very helpful in reaching this result. Marmara: As expected, Black&Veatch has filed a formal notice of arbitration against EECC relative to sums they claim are due them with respect to the Marmara Project. EECC management expects that this will be settled early next year, and that it may provide an opportunity to reach a global settlement with Black & Veatch re Puerto Rico and potential future work.

"fyi -- what do you think? -----Original Message----- From: Hu, Sylvia Sent: Friday, May 18, 2001 3:58 PM To: Walls Jr., Rob Subject: RE: Weed state statues and reporters from Law Library Rob: We'll save: Annual Renewals: $25,000 Library Rent: $10,000 ( $25 x 400 sift free up approx. 400 sift for office space) Labor Cost: $ 9,600 ( 40 hrs. a month, $20 an hour) ____________________________________________________ Total: $44,600 We'll enjoy higher discount and benefit more from our current flat rate contracts with Lexis and Westlaw if internet and online services are our only options. Lexis is set as $55 per ID per month for unlimited usage. We have 175 users in Legal, pay about $9,625 while our actual usage is $35,000 - $40,000 a month. Westlaw is set at $8,000 a month for usage up to $16,000 a month. We pay $8,000 - $9,000 to Westlaw while our usage is about $14,000 a month. Best of all, federal and state statues and rules are more current with government and state websites and on Lexis/Westlaw than printed books. I have custom weblinks of Lexis and Westlaw on our portal. Trainings are offered to let folks to see how we have made search Lexis and Westlaw so easy. My goal is moving us towards a virtual library. I've not gotten any objections with my weeding proposal. I'll wait to Tuesday, 5/22 to proceed with my plan. I welcome your suggestions and advice. Have a nice weekend!
