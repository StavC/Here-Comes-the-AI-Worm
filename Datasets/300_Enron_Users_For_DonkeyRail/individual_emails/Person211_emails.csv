I assume that based on the short term of the agreement, you did not want to include the right to terminate the agreement at any time? (the draft does not so say -- so let me know if you want to add this). 2. The Agreement indicates that payment is $30,000 a month but the term is for 10 weeks or so. So, do you want me to add a statement that this amount will be pro-rated? I ASSUMED SO - SEE EDITS.

Hey Sara, Let's talk in detail Monday but just quickly - its precisely the decision to include the arbitration clause that makes the language prohibitive. I think the gist of the applicable NASD rule is that members cannot draft arbitration clauses which limit the damages that either party would otherwise be entitled to in court. Thus, the solution if Morgan or the others object would be to draft a clause that is consistent with what New York provides -- since New York is the applicable jurisdiction. (I'll find a sample clause I drafted in the past and bring when we meet). Otherwise, these firms could be fined for including such language. I am going to find the applicable rule and make sure that it is still good law but off hand I believe that it is. It will be interesting to note if any of the firms object on this ground.

I am charged by Rick with the policy administration responsibility, and consequently, Veronica and I have been in the process of obtaining updated authorized trader lists. I understand from talking with Legal today that in the past Mike Moscoso from Shona's group maintained this list and provided it to Legal, so I think there are several versions of authorized trader lists floating around. I noticed this since the brokerage agreements and officer's compliance certificate that I have to sign had attached a list that was inconsistent with our records in RAC. Anyway, we're getting the ""official"" list together - hopefully by Monday, at least for the Enron North America traders - and we will provide to both of your groups. Then going forward we'll get the lists posted on the RAC Market Risk Management web site and keep it updated for trader turnover/reassignment so you can both access any time you need to.
