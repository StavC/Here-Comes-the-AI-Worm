"The Gas Daily ""Y"" calc. is slow because of the new Ostrip2 model from Research that Larry requested. George Huan and Luchas Johnson were informed at the time we tested the new model, and agreed to have it migrated to production because Larry wanted it as soon as possible. We asked Zimin for help in speeding the model up, but have not heard from him.

"Jeremy, John and I really need to meet Tuesday for about 30min-1hr with you Dave and Sanjeev, so that we can better understand how the options are being calc'd in the system. We thought we had a pretty good idea after talking on Friday, but tonight we see that we don't. John is about one half million dollars off every night in his prediction of the P/L for Mike's book, and we're afraid our position might not be correct as well. Please give me a call. Thanks, Errol, X5-8274 From: Jeremy Wong/ENRON@enronXgate on 04/09/2001 06:18 PM To: John Griffith/Corp/Enron@Enron cc: Errol McLaughlin/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Dave Wei/ENRON@enronXgate Subject: Vega Issue - Vol. Smile John: The reason for the large Vega numbers on the TopPage report, while there were no corresponding changes in the Volatility curves, is due to the change in the mid. price for the current day versus the prior day. The corresponding volatility skews that are added to the vols. for the 2 days is causing the large vega numbers. For example, for deal number QV5087.2 (exp. date 01-Jan-2002): Current Day Prior Day Mid.
