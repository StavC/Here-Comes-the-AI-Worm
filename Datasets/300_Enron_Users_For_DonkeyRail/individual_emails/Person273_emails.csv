How we prioritize We arrive at these objectives after discussion with heads of the business units and senior management, and we focus on goals that support the priority business goals of the company and build/protect the reputation of the company as a whole. On a quarterly basis (at least) we review these top objectives and ensure that we are staying on target.

"Steve, Diomedes is going to jump all over me for even sending the ESA memo to Metts. I told him that this message affects more than us and he thinks he has free reign within his region. I am vacillating about whether to include the paragraph I put in bold, but I do want everyone to know just how different this is from the sale of one asset. The implications are much broader and we don't want to come off looking dishonest to our own people. And believe me, the rumors are out there. I just don't want to make it worse instead of better and that is my principle concern. In terms of the market finding out, we always say that our assets are always for sale so I don't think we are giving away anything new. I have a draft of the proposed Office of the Chairman letter, (a DC version and a DH version) but need the Skilling input on what our international strategy is. I am caught here between a rock (DC) and a hard place (DH) and I really feel like we need the direction. Both of them have been calling Skilling and we need to take his temperature. If the message it the one Diomedes thinks it is, we definitely will not want to issue an all employee memo. We would be telling about half the international people that there is no future for them.

You wouldn't believe the phonecalls we received from potential customers, partners and others due to the publicity. And employees were stunned by the fabulous production in the lobby.

Rob, will Ken's speech be in good enough shape to either pull bullet points or let Ken peruse the speech beforehand? David heard that Exxon has not signed on to the energy services coalition and wants to know why. I have found out from Joe Hillings the answer and will tell David that Exxon is most welcome to join the coalition and all parties would value their input. Beyond that he can find out from Exxon why they are monopolistic! (I won't say that part). Ken may be asked about our position on China's involvement, which we can handle.

"Steve, Diomedes is going to jump all over me for even sending the ESA memo to Metts. I told him that this message affects more than us and he thinks he has free reign within his region. I am vacillating about whether to include the paragraph I put in bold, but I do want everyone to know just how different this is from the sale of one asset. The implications are much broader and we don't want to come off looking dishonest to our own people. And believe me, the rumors are out there. I just don't want to make it worse instead of better and that is my principle concern. In terms of the market finding out, we always say that our assets are always for sale so I don't think we are giving away anything new. I have a draft of the proposed Office of the Chairman letter, (a DC version and a DH version) but need the Skilling input on what our international strategy is. I am caught here between a rock (DC) and a hard place (DH) and I really feel like we need the direction. Both of them have been calling Skilling and we need to take his temperature. If the message it the one Diomedes thinks it is, we definitely will not want to issue an all employee memo. We would be telling about half the international people that there is no future for them.

"Ken, as you requested, I am participating in the World Economic Forum's task force on Corporate Citizenship/Corporate Responsibility and attended the first meeting last week in Geneva. In addition, Mike Terraso and I met with the World Business Council for Sustainable Development. Here is an update on those meetings and next steps. WEF Goals of the task force are: To assess the business case for and practice and measurement of CSR. To develop recommendations for consideration by members; and To promote cooperation among companies, experts and stakeholders. Companies attending included Van Heusen, 3M, Budimex (a Polish construction company), Deutschebank, ITC (an Indian packaging subsidiary of BAT), Accenture, Arthur D. Little, Suez, Electricite de France, and Siemens. Representatives from these leading NGOs were guests: CERES, Business for Social Responsibility, the Price of Wales International Business Leaders Forum, the Conference Board and the Global Compact. WEF staff Richard Samans, director of the Global Issues Centre for the Global Agenda, and Donna Redel, Managing Director, moderated the meetings. While a few of the companies have been active in CSR, many had not yet examined these issues internally and were just starting to think about the implications. We had the types of discussions that companies typically have when they are embarking on something new, the same discussions we had at Enron over a year ago. I don't think this was negative for a first meeting, and broadening the understanding of and interest in these issues will require a climb up the learning curve for many",kelly.kimberly@enron.com,kenneth.lay@enron.com,"'Ken' : 'person', 'Mike Terraso' : 'person', 'Arthur D.

"Kelly: Thanks for the quick turn-around. The positions we have in the Qs and As have been used for 2 years -- in India by Sanjay, Europe, US, everywhere!! Many people, including Rob B. have seen these positions. Rob's central concern is with respect to the science ( a position which I do not argue and STRONGLY believe that Enron should not argue since we are not scientists and have no general interest in getting involved, as a company, in scientific arguments). The positions articulated in the Qs and As are good for Enron's commercial ventures which I am heading and I believe Rob has nothing to say about what Enron staff are doing to pursue their parochial commercial interests; this is a pure business decision. This intrusion to shape positions that benefit the Sutton-blessed business would be strongly resisted by me. Please see the attached. As you know, Ken was in Davos. Look at this summary that came directly off of the Davos web site -- climate change was seen by business leader at Davos as the greatest challenge during the next century.

"Kelly: Thanks for the quick turn-around. The positions we have in the Qs and As have been used for 2 years -- in India by Sanjay, Europe, US, everywhere!! Many people, including Rob B. have seen these positions. Rob's central concern is with respect to the science ( a position which I do not argue and STRONGLY believe that Enron should not argue since we are not scientists and have no general interest in getting involved, as a company, in scientific arguments). The positions articulated in the Qs and As are good for Enron's commercial ventures which I am heading and I believe Rob has nothing to say about what Enron staff are doing to pursue their parochial commercial interests; this is a pure business decision. This intrusion to shape positions that benefit the Sutton-blessed business would be strongly resisted by me. Please see the attached. As you know, Ken was in Davos. Look at this summary that came directly off of the Davos web site -- climate change was seen by business leader at Davos as the greatest challenge during the next century.

"Kelly: Thanks for the quick turn-around. The positions we have in the Qs and As have been used for 2 years -- in India by Sanjay, Europe, US, everywhere!! Many people, including Rob B. have seen these positions. Rob's central concern is with respect to the science ( a position which I do not argue and STRONGLY believe that Enron should not argue since we are not scientists and have no general interest in getting involved, as a company, in scientific arguments). The positions articulated in the Qs and As are good for Enron's commercial ventures which I am heading and I believe Rob has nothing to say about what Enron staff are doing to pursue their parochial commercial interests; this is a pure business decision. This intrusion to shape positions that benefit the Sutton-blessed business would be strongly resisted by me. Please see the attached. As you know, Ken was in Davos.
