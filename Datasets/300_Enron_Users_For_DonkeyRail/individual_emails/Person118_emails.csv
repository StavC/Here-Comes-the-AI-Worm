"To All - Attached is an updated version of the Intercontinental Exchange Participant Agreement - complete with schedules for transaction costs in various commodities. This form is a new version of the existing Participant Agreement Enron currently has in place and is anticipated to be effective on December 1, 2001. While I have been reviewing the legal terms and conditions, I need some assistance from you - the business personnel - on the pricing stated in the applicable schedules. These price schedules have all been updated from the existing contracts. At your convenience, please review the schedule applicable to your particular commodity or forward it to the appropriate person for review. Please let me know if the pricing is acceptable. Granted, since this is a form agreement we may not have much power to change any pricing, but I at least want each of you to be aware of the changes. Thanks.

"Gentlemen - Attached you will find updated versions of the BETA and FA . These documents incorporate all of the prior changes we discussed and reflect some of the final points we discussed yesterday. As there were many items discussed, but only a very few requiring insertion into the BETA and FA, I hope that I covered them all. I have also attached clean versions of these agreements. If the documents meet with your approval, please have two originals of each document printed for signature by an authorized officer of APB, being sure to attach the final form of the Exhibit A to each original of the FA. Once each document is signed and dated (and the Password is completed in the FA), please fax a copy of each agreement to Bob at 713-646-2126. Enron will countersign the faxed copy and forward a copy to your attention via fax. The originals should also be forwarded to Bob so that they can be physically countersigned by Enron.

"Todd/Joe - Thanks for the time earlier today on this matter. I know that both Bob and I appreciate your attention to these agreement. Consistent with our conversation, I have made changes to both the Fee Agreement and BETA. I have attached marked versions of these documents reflecting my additional changes (all additions marked in caps and bolded). I have also attached ""clean"" drafts which incorporate all prior changes and reflect the last set of Enron additions in caps and bold. On the Fee Agreement, two changes were made that were not discussed, both in relation to the Access Fee. I apologize for not having raised these points, but they were overlooked in my notes. The first of these changes is the deletion of the concept of a partial quarterly payment. The concept behind the Access Fee is that it is an annual fee that is to be collected at the time the Fee Agreement is signed; however, because of our negotiations, we are comfortable allowing the fee to be paid over the year in four equal installments. Accordingly, a partial payment should not occur as we are contemplating a contract running for a full calendar year. Secondly, the last sentence of the Access Fee paragraph has been modified. It is intended by Enron that any entity who has signed a BETA is subject to paying an Access Fee. No subsidiary of APB should be signing a BETA unless a Fee Agreement has been completed. Finally, in the interest of time, I am forwarding the attached without first having had Bob review the changes.

"Bob - Thanks for the information and access id's.

These people will need to review the product definitions/descriptions - if any - on the Tradequote site, as well as any other items associated with these products.

"Bob - My initial response is that the amendment can be provided. I am not sure, however, that we satisfy the rationale behind the collateral/lc by doing this. Remember, until the counterparty actually confirms with Enron (or performs the transaction), Enron does not maintain any direct contractual relationship with the Counterparty. All Enron has is a confirmation from the broker, the party with whom we have contracted through the BrokerClient product. In this situation, both the broker and Enron are really in the same position as if the transaction were a telephone trade by a broker. I will give this a bit more thought and discuss possible options with Mark. Maybe it is as simple as obtaining a document from the counterparty under which they acknowledge (1) the broker is authorized to act on its behalf, (2) the relationship is truly one of agent and principal such that the actions of the broker (e.g., transacting online) are really the actions of the counterparty and (3) the counterparty agrees to be liable to Enron as if the counterparty had, itself, performed the transaction online. The last point could be used to tie any breach of a transaction to the master agreement/GTC's between Enron and the counterparty - the same method that is currently employed to calculate the Liquidated Damages under the BETA.

"Joe - Thanks for the information. As I told Cornelio in relation to the EWS - Legal Project, I am currently only responsible for the LegalOnline project and work on this under the authority of Mark Haedicke. As to the other projects, why and how may name became associated with them is both interesting and incorrect as I am not the ""sponsor"" of any of them. Last week I received the first indication of the need to discuss these projects in line with ENW's budget approval for ENA projects. Since a conference call was scheduled for earlier today to discuss these items, I figured I would gather more information and forward that information to the appropriate member of the Dept. for review, consideration and action. I was advised yesterday that the budget was approved and there was no need for today's conference call. Despite this budget approval (without EWS Legal discussion), ENW personnel have continued to request that I ""approve"" these projects for next year - even if the approval is only as a ""placeholder"" for the budget. I cannot do this and, quite frankly, see no value in obtaining these ""approvals"" if the budget has been approved. If those responsible for these other projects would like me to follow-up with you on these matters and authorize me to do so, I would be more than happy to do so.

No word yet from them. Below is an NDA from Sabre Corporation, which I received today. As you may know, Sabre is mostly known as a Global Distribution Services company (GDS), chiefly providing an electronic distribution channel for airline seats to travel agents and a growing group of internet purveyors. ENW would like to explore ways to help Sabre possibly create a new ticket distribution platform, which may involve imparting the knowledge and systems we have used in the development of EOL. I would characterize our discussions as exploratory. See Supplement 1 or NDA for Sabre's characterization of undertaking. My legal-wannabe eye says you may have issues with paragraph 5, 7 and 9. Let me know if I should provide you with anything further. Brenda Crabtree's number is below. I assume she is with Sabre's legal group. They seem fairly intent on using their NDA.

"Michelle - Since this deal is beginning to heat up again, I wanted to get you back in the loop. The earlier e-mail is a good overview of the structure proposed for ownership. Some minor movement of employees may be required, but it is not anticipated at this time that many, if any, employees will be terminated. A few key individuals have change of control severance agreements, but overall there is no change of control trigger affecting the employee base. I have attached a copy of the Legal Risk Memo I provided to Mark H. in advance of approvals. It contains a summary of the deal and a general outline of the identified issues, including two related to pension issues in Quebec.

"Mark, We sent Chisholm an electronic copy of the LOI and received some comments. in paragraph 2, Chisholm would like to see something other than obligation, as we never state what is our 'current obligation.' I guess the word 'obligation' raises an eyebrow. We explained that the NDA and its conditions would still be in place. Is there a way to tweak the language to more clearly state this and not use 'obligation'? of course the non-solicitation clause was another point of clarification. Currently, Chisholm is using students to develop an internal system and they have been working with other vendors. Therefore, this clause will not work. So we have discussed putting in a Notification clause in that Chisholm will notify us and keep us informed about the status of other vendors. Perhaps something that would read ""Chisholm agrees that it will notify Enron if and when it decides to enter into a formal agreement with any third party vendor etc."" Give me a call if this doesn't make sense.

"Mark: Per our conversation, I understand that the Canadian company has a number of outstanding OTC FX transactions with one or more counterparties. Each of those transactions should be documented by a confirmation which confirms the economic terms of each deal. Each confirmation must be subject to (1) an existing type of master agreement (such as the ISDA, IFEMA, FEOMA), (2) a ""deemed"" version of such an agreement or (3) ""terms and conditions"" appearing in the confirmation itself. It is quite likely that in any of these three types of confirmations, there are provisions for assignment of trades, credit event upon merger, material adverse change, additonal events of default or termination, etc. which may be triggered by the pending acquisiton of the Canadian company. Further, there may be credit issues associated with the transactions and/or master agreements (in the form of specific credit provisions in a confirmation or a credit annex to the master agreement). As a result, a party attempting to ""step into the shoes of the Canadian company"" must review the existing documents, subject to any confidentiality restrictions, in order to evaluate the positions and risks associated with assuming those positions. Thus, we need to conduct a thorough due diligence of the financial trading positions of the Canadian company. Please let me know if you have any questions.

"Mark, Thanks for the feedback. I think that the only open issue is the Section 5 nonsolicitation provision. BEA has a corporate policy against nonsolicitation commitments, primarily because of the administrative burden in keeping track of such obligations. Of course, it would be extremely short sighted of BEA to target a customer's employees. The only way that BEA could consider any such commitment would be to make the provisions mutual. As a practical matter, BEA is more at risk of having a customer solicit its employees - who are experts with the BEA software in which a customer is interested - than is our customer whose employees are experts at the customer's business in which BEA is not engaged. I have attached a revised draft of the NDA letter in which I have incorporated your feedback and added in a mutual nonsolicitation provision. Does this work for you?
