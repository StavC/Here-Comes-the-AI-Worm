"A man was stopped by a game-warden in Northern Michigan recently with two buckets of fish leaving a lake well known for its fishing. The game warden asked the man, ""Do you have a license to catch those fish?"" The man replied to the game warden, ""No, sir. These are my pet fish."" ""Pet fish?!"" the warden asked. ""Yes, sir. Every night I take these here fish down to the lake and let them swim around for a while. I whistle and they jump back into their buckets, and I take em home."" ""That's a bunch of hooey! Fish can't do that!"" The man looked at the game warden for a moment, and then said, ""Here, I'll show you. It really works."" ""O.K. I've GOT to see this!."" The game warden was curious, now. The man poured the fish in to the lake and stood and waited. After several minutes, the game warden turned to the man and said, ""Well?"" ""Well, What?"" the man responded. ""When are you going to call them back?"" The game warden prompted. ""Call who back?"" The man asked. ""The fish."" replied the warden. ""What fish?""

"Chris--I apologize for having to revise the numbers I sent a few minutes ago, but I had made an erroneous assumption about the volume of SONAT storage gas that we could withdraw in March. I will put these values into the spreadsheet that I sent earlier, but this will give you an idea of what the numbers look like. As in my prior message, the above values for storage withdrawals assume that we are maximizing the withdrawals from the so-called ""Directly Assigned Storage"" that ENA schedules on our behalf. I believe that notwithstanding the above storage withdrawal values, we will still have storage inventory left at the end of March since our withdrawals to date have been so low. Both the Storage withdrawals shown above and the Flowing gas should flow on Primary firm capacity since we have been assigned this capacity by AGL. The above numbers also assume that we will be maximizing our withdrawals of AGL's IBSS (Incremental Bundled Storage Service) during March. The IBSS withdrawals are not included in the storage withdrawal volumes shown above, since we schedule the IBSS ourselves at AGL's citygate. Note also that the total daily volume on Sonat--Stg WD plus Flowing-- is higher than in my prior transmittal. The reason is that I am assuming no peaking inventory withdrawals during March versus daily withdrawals of approximately 2,800 dth/day in my prior transmittal. This translates into a higher gas requirement from Enron. Again, sorry for the confusion and this",dkinney@columbiaenergygroup.com,chris.germany@enron.com,'Chris' : 'person',1,AGL March'00 Requirements Revised,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,received,chris.germany@enron.com

His comments are as follows: 1. Generally, Hugh is adamant that the proposed offer to sell gas to Bridgeline be solely for the gas and not include any discount component for storage and transportation. 2. He is also firm that we pay for one month of transport and storage to move the gas off-system. He envisions full service under the contracts during this period such that all scheduling and other provisions under the contract are followed as in the normal course of business. The plan would be for us to try to get all of the gas out of storage in month. To the extent that residual gas remains, Bridgeline may be willing to buy it to avoid triggering another month of services under the contracts. 3. Hugh wanted clarification on the segregated account. He wants this concept back in and is not comfortable with any potential lien attachment afforded under Section 7-209 of the Louisiana UCC. 4. Hugh stuck to the issues related to the movement/sale of gas out and storage and did not attempt to link the removal of the gas to rejection of the contracts. As stated above, however, he was very clear on separating the commodity price from the cost of service on the system. 5.",ruth.concannon@enron.com,chris.germany@enron.com,"'Schneider, Chip' : 'person', 'Bartlett, Jeff' : 'person', 'Concannon, Ruth' : 'person', 'Gray, Barbara N.' : 'person', 'Jayne South' : 'person', 'E-mail' : 'email', 'Mark Ellenberg' : 'person', 'E-mail' : 'email', 'McMichael Jr., Ed' : 'person', 'Sharp, Greg' : 'person', 'Stephen Youngman' : 'person', 'E-mail' : 'email', 'Hugh Connett' : 'person'",13,FW: Today's discussion with Bridgeline,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,received,chris.germany@enron.com

"Jeff (CES) and I just had a nice chat about the Choice program. Jeff mentioned the ""famous contracts"" that should be used for Choice Peaking outside the SST.

This would impact about 40 nominations on TCO side. You would have to ask Kara/Heidi/Kim/Donna... how many nom's on their side. Because of the labor involved and the general consensus not to cut CES EU markets, we have always left these nom's alone. We have found other capacity for Choice gas above the SST capacity (54,000 now and 134,000 in the winter). There are many different options... and we can discuss them over a conference call. The other item to consider, the Choice program requires us to have some STOW to use to balance Choice burns. Currently, I have been doing 50/50 to 60/40 split (pool/stow).

"for the 16th, yes we swung down to nearly zero on storage, but in a few markets we were delivering SST from pool and FT and had to overdeliver.

"Chris, Faye has completed moving all of the facilities on your request, EXCEPT meter 006335 because a deal that is booked on that meter had volumes with a status other than ""expected"" which means we have to work on that behind the scenes. Below is a list of deals that were impacted by her moving all of the other meters. I am bouncing the server and it wil take about 15 minutes to complete. After that, you will have to get completely out of all open Sitara applications (including the Launch Pad) and get back in. Open the deals listed below and make sure the location field on the deal exchange says ""inconsistent"". You should only be concerned with the exchanges for 6/1/00 and forward. Click Edit and then go to the location field and click on the ellipsis. Click OK when the Facility dialogue box opens and the correct zone should appear automatically. Before you tab out of that field, make sure that the deal volume equals the expected volume. If the volumes are not equal, make a note of the expected volumes and how they are broken out because they will default to the deal volume as soon as you tab out. If the volumes are different, update them as necessary and then release the deal. Repeat this for all exchanges for 6/1/00 and forward and for all deals. The second thing you need to do is identify any swaps that are linked to the physical forwards. If none are linked then that's great because you won't have to worry about that. If some exist, you will have to update the swap to reflect the correct zone.
