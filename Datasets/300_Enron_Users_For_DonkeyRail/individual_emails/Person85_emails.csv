The Flipped-Over Rock February 21, 2002 By WILLIAM SAFIRE WASHINGTON -- What wife of a United States senator profited from her close association with a big company that did heavy lobbying of the federal government and then went bust, costing investors billions and workers their jobs? Why, Wendy Gramm, most recently awakened watchdogs would say, wife of the Republican Phil Gramm of Texas, previous chairman of the Banking Committee. As a director of Enron, she was on the audit committee that didn't question the fast-and- loose auditing, and (subtracting the deferred compensation that went into the tank) received about $220,000 over eight years. That's peanuts, say Republicans. The senatorial wife who hit it big was Anne Bingaman, married to New Mexico's Jeff Bingaman, chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee. As lobbyist for the telecommunications comet Global Crossing, which went bankrupt last month, she received $2,500,000 for six months' work during 1999. Both senatorial wives are accomplished executives who parlayed responsible government appointments into lucrative private positions. Wendy Gramm was chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.

"Hey Ben, How is life in Texas? Have you met that guy Rob McDonald I know from DC? He is good friends with my cousin Eddy Quinn. Life has gotten rather boring out here. We have a ton of work to do and work long hours with no days off. This work style in the beginning made time fly but recently the monotony of the routine has gotten mundane. We all live for port calls and push the envelope of ethical billing while in port. I have been shot down by every school I applied for. How about you? They can all blow me as I would probably outperform all of those faggots with high GMATs. That has been my achilles heel. Right now I am focused on the summer and getting off this ship. I hope I get in the marathon because I have been training for so long. There is nothing else to do except that in my free time. If I don't have a goal to shoot for then I could never keep up this training on land. The summer will be the hardest because I am going to want to travel and visit people when I get back. Any plans to be in NY this summer? I have been messing around with stocks too. I have made only a little since the tech crash. I stay away from those Internet companies so I didn't get killed.

"Hi Ben, Many thanks for your thoughtful email and thoughtful visit. It's very important for everyone to put names with faces and to understand the nuances of individuals' circumstances. My colleagues and I very much appreciate your enthusiasm for the Texas Business School and I wish you the best with the application process. I hope to see you next fall.

David Jemison: Thank you for taking the time to meet with me last Friday afternoon. I really enjoyed meeting you and talking about the Texas Business School. My meetings with Professors' Brown, Titman and Ronn were extremely helpful with regards to learning about the energy-finance program and the investment fund. In reference to our discussion about my low GMAT scores, I do not test well on these types of tests, thus I have always had to work a lot harder than most to get where I want to go, therefore I am accustom to working hard to reach my goals. Enron is based on a team-oriented approach, where people with diverse skills come together to formulate innovative ideas and financial products and to solve difficult problems for our customers. The Texas Business School seems to work on this approach, thus I would be able to provide my skills as well as learn from others. I have excelled in this type of environment at Enron and feel that I would continue to excel at the Texas Business School.

By Rick Aristotle Munarriz When is less, more? For publishing software leader Adobe (Nasdaq: ADBE) it means growing operating profits next year by scaling back on research and development. The company announced its guidance at yesterday's 2000 Fall Financial Analyst Meeting. The logic may seem absurd in this era of perpetual obsolescence. The failure to plant seeds today means less of a harvest to reap tomorrow. But Adobe feels that it can still seize the future by trimming research expenditures from 20% to just 19% of projected sales.
