Section 2.1 (d)--Shouldn't it just say ""highway"" as opposed to ""major highway""? 4. Section 2--Need to add the following concept. 90 days after RTO, Purchaser shall identify up to [5] primary or alternative sites for installation of the units (identification to include an expected configuration). Upon 10 day notice, Purchaser shall have the right to substitute sites or change site configurations. The project plans shall be based on the primary configurations identified by Purchaser. 4 months prior to shipment, Purchaser must identify the site where a unit must go. At this point, the site is locked in for that unit. 5. Section 3.3 (c)--insert ""or as reasonably required to implement"" after ""as required by"". 6. Section 3.16--Add in concept of identified sites. Timing of plans should coincide with site identification. 7. Section 5.1.1--Incorprate concept that shipping per unit is based on the lesser of actual costs or $87,000 per unit. I think that FCE agreed to this concept. 8.

"1. Section 11.1--Do we insert adjustment to purchase price for acceptance test here? 2.

Section 14.1.1--Should we say ""electric"" industry standards? 6. Section 14.1.1 (a)--Did we agree to give up? 7. Section14.2--Do we have enough information to write a rough version? 8. Section 15.1--Is payment withheld while working to improve performance? If not, then title transfer seems ok. Otherwise, I don't know. 9. Section 17.2--need to incorporate concept that units at site at time of termination notice and accepted within 2 months of notice get paid for. All other units are terminated. We also have the average price issue. 10. Section 17.4--How do we handle a default by Seller in combination by a purchaser delay.

"I wanted to clarify our game plan for the next couple of weeks. 1. Tomorrow a meeting is taking place with FuelCells to resolve some major outstanding business issues. At this meeting, the point is going to be made that in order to maintain the desired schedule, FCE is going to have to increase its technical effort. Presently, we are concerned that the technical aspects of the purchase order are not in sufficient order to finalize a purchase order by next week (we want to make certain that our deal with FuelCells is largely defined before we make a state filing). We are going to emphasize to FCE that both sides need to devote their technical resources to this goal. One of our priorities is to bring the technical portions of the purchase order up to the level necessary to finalize an order. I need the Tony Leo list today so I can show FuelCells all the information that they owe us before this meeting. 2. We have redrafted the purchase order. However, the P.O. needs refinement to reflect the resolution of the outstanding business terms and to make certain that the technical information and procedures are clearly defined (much of the information that I sent you). Given 1) the proposed payment mechanics and 2) FCE's lack of mature documents, we are concerned that FCE will try to get by with loose technical language to avoid acceptance and ultimately payment issues. Also, we are concerned that once we make our state filing that our negotiating leverage with FCE will go down.

What specific standards should we hold FCE to in coming up with the final design ( I need to put these standards into the P.O.).

"I wanted to clarify our game plan for the next couple of weeks. 1. Tomorrow a meeting is taking place with FuelCells to resolve some major outstanding business issues. At this meeting, the point is going to be made that in order to maintain the desired schedule, FCE is going to have to increase its technical effort. Presently, we are concerned that the technical aspects of the purchase order are not in sufficient order to finalize a purchase order by next week (we want to make certain that our deal with FuelCells is largely defined before we make a state filing). We are going to emphasize to FCE that both sides need to devote their technical resources to this goal. One of our priorities is to bring the technical portions of the purchase order up to the level necessary to finalize an order. I need the Tony Leo list today so I can show FuelCells all the information that they owe us before this meeting. 2. We have redrafted the purchase order. However, the P.O. needs refinement to reflect the resolution of the outstanding business terms and to make certain that the technical information and procedures are clearly defined (much of the information that I sent you). Given 1) the proposed payment mechanics and 2) FCE's lack of mature documents, we are concerned that FCE will try to get by with loose technical language to avoid acceptance and ultimately payment issues. Also, we are concerned that once we make our state filing that our negotiating leverage with FCE will go down.

"Scott, Your question #2 raises a good point. My thought in bracketing the name is optionality. I'm trying to be aware of potential balance sheet issues. As you know, if this contract ends up in such shape that it can be construed as a committment to purchase equipment, we will need to cross the balance sheet bridge. As far as I know, we have not ruled out that possibility, as well as the possibility that ENA or an affilate may be the EPC contractor, or somehow in the title chain. I was thinking that if we use an LLC we have the option to see .he equity in an LLC holding the contractual rights/obligations (for financing purposes or otherwise). In that case, we may want to use an LLC instead of messing with an assignment later. I am very interested in your insight concerning possible structures, and what we need to keep in mind.

Hence, I think that we have to reference the manufacturer. 2. The attachment of the Development Agreement is a Jeff question. In order to mark any 2000 income, we will need to get CRRA to execute the Development Agreement in 2000. In my opinion, we should show CRRA a copy of the LOI with the assumption that the Development Agreement is attached. I would actually send them the draft Development Agreement a couple days after the LOI. Based on how CRRA reacts, I would make an ultimate determination if the agreement needs to be attached to the LOI. 3. I expect at least one EPC contract per project.

"Scott, Your question #2 raises a good point. My thought in bracketing the name is optionality. I'm trying to be aware of potential balance sheet issues. As you know, if this contract ends up in such shape that it can be construed as a committment to purchase equipment, we will need to cross the balance sheet bridge. As far as I know, we have not ruled out that possibility, as well as the possibility that ENA or an affilate may be the EPC contractor, or somehow in the title chain. I was thinking that if we use an LLC we have the option to see .he equity in an LLC holding the contractual rights/obligations (for financing purposes or otherwise). In that case, we may want to use an LLC instead of messing with an assignment later. I am very interested in your insight concerning possible structures, and what we need to keep in mind.

Deal summary: - ENA would sell four LM-6000 turbines to Calpine. - Calpine would be responsible for permitting, constructing, financing and operating the peaking power plant in Eastern PJM. - ENA would enter into a short-terrm tolling agreement to buy power from Calpine for 3 or 5 years. - Profit generator: We buy power from Calpine at lower price than that of ENA bid curve. Work needed to be done : - getting VOM for LM-6000 from Scot Chambers. - getting flat capacity payment ($/kw-mo period) for 3 and 5 years from Structuring group, based on VOM, heat rate, gas curve, dispatch, and location of the plant. - building 20 year economic model to understand Calpine position. While we are waiting for VOM from Scot Chambers, we will use VOM number from other LM-6000 deal (please see attached email sent to Structuring group by Ben). As soon as we hear from Structuring group, I will give you indicative numbers. Sorry for the delay. Thank you. Jinsung Myung (Ext: 37330) PS: If someone needs to have just Eastern PJM curve, we can try to get from Structuring group.

"Hi Scott, I have some questions: The obligation to try to improve performance about the specific performance (ie minimum) standards frequently has a time limit, say 6 months. Do you have a sense for the appropriate time period here? Would it make sense to require them to work longer on the first 2.0 and 2.4 than the rest? Will we have a drawing number for a standard foundation design, or will we need to put words around it. I know we discussed the need for pilings as the most significant change. Do you think that this difference is enough? Did I understand that we want them to pay us at the end for non-standard foundations (as opposed to a credit). On termination, are we going with the average value no matter what the reason for termination, with a rep along the lines of whay you wrote, plus some monitoring ability. On assignment, they mentioned a corporate guaranty. I was thinking of using something broader due to various financing/balance sheet considerations, perhaps tying it to a guaranty from a BBB rated entity. Do we want an option to have them store these, which would then impact payment?

"Scott, Structuring got back to us with some issues we need to clarify to get the pricing from a trader. Capacity - Will Calpine be able to get manufacturer's guarantee for net capacity (or can we re-sell turbines to third party?) - Is it ""unit contingent call"" or there will be a ""liquidated damage protection"" within the tolling agreement? Nodal pricing - What is the exact name of substation in eastern PJM? Structuring could not find ""Parlin"" in eastern PJM (even within eastern PJM, there will a substantial pricing differential among different bus points). Gas delivery point Actually, it is really hard to get the number by today since a trader who will give pricing is not here today. If we don't hear from you or/and if you don't decide yet about above issues, we will make assumptions as follow; - Capacity: 180 MW out of 4 LM-6000 turbine with manufacturer's guarantee and with term of liquidated damage protection included. - Exact substation: East Hub in PJM - Gas delivery point: Transco Zone 6 We will try to get the pricing hopefully by tomorrow.

"Scott, Your question #2 raises a good point. My thought in bracketing the name is optionality. I'm trying to be aware of potential balance sheet issues. As you know, if this contract ends up in such shape that it can be construed as a committment to purchase equipment, we will need to cross the balance sheet bridge. As far as I know, we have not ruled out that possibility, as well as the possibility that ENA or an affilate may be the EPC contractor, or somehow in the title chain. I was thinking that if we use an LLC we have the option to see .he equity in an LLC holding the contractual rights/obligations (for financing purposes or otherwise). In that case, we may want to use an LLC instead of messing with an assignment later. I am very interested in your insight concerning possible structures, and what we need to keep in mind.
