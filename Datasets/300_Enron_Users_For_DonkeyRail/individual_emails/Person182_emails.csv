"Friday 1/19/01 - Received a call from Sheila at Basin regarding a well which may be coming on this weekend (meter 9696). Phone Lee in Gas Control regarding same. Lee informed me that HPL would prefer that the volumes are not brought on until a field tech can pull a sample and verify that there are no liquids involved. Lee further informed me that the same day to Tejas at Hardy was not in the system, and, per Gary Hanks, needed to be corrected. Lee informed me that the volumes were actually split 10M at Hardy/Tejas and 10M at Lomax. I went into Sitara and updated the deal ticket, pathed and nominated over to Pops. Saturday 1/20/01 - 8:30 am Sean paged regarding the nomination at Dow Freeport, he was questioning the validity, as we do not often flow at this meter. I checked and the nomination was good for Saturday's gas day. Sean informed me that the Valero Refinery was up and down and would be going completely down on Sunday. 10:00 am - Sean called regarding Tejas LaPorte, meter 665. Apparently, the meter had a confirmed volume of 20M and HPL/ENA had no deal at the meter. Checked in POPS and discovered that the deal was confirmed at 20M on a deal volume of zero. Informed Sean that the Tejas volume was confirmed. Also, per Sean Koch George West (meter 6722) had a nomination increase of 10M, which he wanted to confirm.

"Per our various discussions, I am sending an email to reiterate the disposition of volumes at Meter 9862, the Lehman Spinaker pay meter. At this time, the General Land Office is transporting their share of production (21.8945% interest) and HPL is purchasing the remaining 78.1055%. The GLO has nominated a transport volume at meter 9848, effective September 1, 2000. During this time, some test gas flowed. I have had the HPL purchase back-dated to coincide with the transport nomination, and have had both deals moved to 9862. The meter should probably be designated a Callout/Swing so that the proper equity percentages can be allocated after the production month by Volume Management. For October production forward, I am going to re-rank/confirm the pay meter to ensure that the GLO receives a volume which should be close to their percentage after actuals close for the month. This should alleviate any large balance swings on their agreement. Anita: For September, I need an accounting arrangement on deal ticket 379424; HPL gathering agmt. at meter 9862. Please unallocate the transport and purchase at 9848. The meter is a daily swing right now. Let me know when you are ready and I will change the allocation methodology. I apologize for the length of this email, I want to make sure that we are all on the same page, to the extent that we need to be, prior to this deal getting too far down the road.
