"Melissa - I think we've finally reached a conclusion on the long term PX Index deals. I've entered the following comment in the six deals still in the system with Constellation at the old index: Constellation and EPMI have agreed to leave deal at PX Index. Counterparties' positions tie out - index price should not be relevant; however, index offset will. Per Bob Badeer, 4/18/01. KS This is exactly how Bob explained it to me, and he said it was exactly as Constellation understood it as well. So if this sounds good to you, I think we're set. If not, please let me know and we can make whatever changes are necessary.
