"Given they are a muni, I am fine with this exception. In practice, we have experienced situations with certain cp's where we have had to come up with certain margining exceptions. WRT amendments, such amendments can be done within the same time period as well. I think that we could add that the cp is required to provide a representation (perhaps an officer's certificate of some sort) stating that they are going to their Board for posting of the collateral. We got that provision from another municipality.

"We're getting on this for you... Hey, hopefully the info below will help you with transitioning back to Houston with respect to the ""go to"" people in credit to help you on your deals. Hotline (x3-1803) GAS TEAM contacts: -Jay Williams (manager)- supports mainly Fred Lagrasta's desk -Russell Diamond- is the gas credit guy that takes care of the domestic portfolio and some of Canada gas -Veronica Espinoza- works with Jay and Russell -Brant Reves- support mainly Bridgeline -Darren Vanek- new addition to the gas team Your best bet for ""instantaneous"" credit answers would be to call the credit hotline. You should probably ask for Russell Diamond to get domestic gas questions answered. Then Jay Williams or Veronica Espinoza as back up. Russell Diamond was the one who worked on Sandia Resources from a WMBE gas perspective. On the legal front, your physical gas paralegal is Debra Perlingiere.

"Rod, Enron North America is looking to enter into power swaps with Kaiser Aluminum & Chemical Corporation starting June 2001. I'm seeing in the credit system that MG plc has forward financial metals positions with Kaiser, however I need clarification on whether the swaps are done with Kaiser Aluminum & Chemical Corporation or Kaiser Aluminum International Inc. Secondly, is there a Master ISDA Agreement governing those swaps? In pulling the mtm monthly breakout, it appears that MG plc is OTM north of $10MM US and the liquidation of that portfolio occurs mostly in cal '02. Given Kaiser's limited credit line, I'd like to look into the potential of setting off financial exposures in the UK and US in cases of default. Kaiser is looking at other businesses with Enron and this could be quite fruitful to tap into in order to increase trading liquidity going forward. In summary, we need to answer at minimum the following: ? confirmation of which Kaiser entity is financial transacting with MG plc ? volatility of the metal positions that go out to Jan '04 to ensure how quickly this out-of-the-money position can move ? what type of paper is confirming the swaps (whether long-form confirms or Master ISDA) ? what credit/legal terms and laws may affect our efforts to establish a Netting Agreement for UK and US financial Can you help me in coordinating a meeting with London legal/credit and Portland credit/Houston legal to discuss pertinent issues associated with a Netting Agreement between Kaiser (single ",tracy.ngo@enron.com,roderick.nelson@enron.com,'Rod' : 'person',1,Kaiser Aluminum & Chemical Corporation - UK and US swaps,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,sent,tracy.ngo@enron.com

"With respect to doing a financial trade out of Energy West Incorporated versus Energy West Resources, Inc., they are not one in the same. Energy West Incorporated is the parent of Energy West Resources, Inc. We currently have an ISDA between Enron Canada Corp. and Energy West Incorporated. Unfortunately, any unsecured credit lines have been taken by the Canadian team via the ISDA in Canada. Since physical power came later, we have had to secure all deals with Energy West Resources, Inc. since our credit appetite for the overall organization has been saturated with financial Canadian deals. Therefore, to the extent that we do any financial business with Energy West Resources, Inc. or Energy West Incorporated with ENA, we will need to get a new ISDA in place, and will need collateral upfront prior to transacting. FYI - the majority of the financial in-the-money exposure with Energy West Incorporated out of Canada will not roll off until 10/01 and 10/03, unless we do additional financial deals out of Canada to offset. Credit is secured and covered in Canada for financial exposure and will watch the exposures accordingly to see if we can ever allocate some of the credit appetite to accommodate physical business out of ENA. John, please let me know how you would like to proceed. I can start with a credit worksheet to the financial team to get the ball rolling.

"We're getting on this for you... Hey, hopefully the info below will help you with transitioning back to Houston with respect to the ""go to"" people in credit to help you on your deals. Hotline (x3-1803) GAS TEAM contacts: -Jay Williams (manager)- supports mainly Fred Lagrasta's desk -Russell Diamond- is the gas credit guy that takes care of the domestic portfolio and some of Canada gas -Veronica Espinoza- works with Jay and Russell -Brant Reves- support mainly Bridgeline -Darren Vanek- new addition to the gas team Your best bet for ""instantaneous"" credit answers would be to call the credit hotline. You should probably ask for Russell Diamond to get domestic gas questions answered. Then Jay Williams or Veronica Espinoza as back up. Russell Diamond was the one who worked on Sandia Resources from a WMBE gas perspective. On the legal front, your physical gas paralegal is Debra Perlingiere. The physical gas attorneys that come to mind are Dan Hyvl and Stacy Dickson. Their boss I believe is Jeff Hodge. Hope this info helps you. Take care. Happy New Year's! Did you party in Houston???

"Tracy, Did you have a chance to read my email response earlier this week? I believe that it is highly unlikely that we will be able to net exposures across non-defaulting (Enron) entities. Paul Simons can (and maybe has by now) given opinion to this idea. Historically, I believe the opinion has long been that such netting (set-off against affiliates of non-defaulting party) in the US should work within the case of contractual default, but outside of bankruptcy. However, in the special case of legal bankruptcy, such netting (though contractually agreed by the parties) may be challenged. Introducing the fact that one of Enron's entities is a UK entity may further cloud the likelihood. Clearly, if the relationship involves more than on Kaiser entity, netting almost certainly will not work. Has Diana not responded to your credit exposure questions regarding the form of governing confirmation and legal entity? I believe that she is in the US, but should be checking in. Perhaps you should try calling her? I think we will find that the transacting entity is a subsidiary of Kaiser Aluminum. Risk management systems for metals are still not ideal. Volumetric/CVAR type analysis may not yield such reliable results.

"Tracy, Did you have a chance to read my email response earlier this week? I believe that it is highly unlikely that we will be able to net exposures across non-defaulting (Enron) entities. Paul Simons can (and maybe has by now) given opinion to this idea. Historically, I believe the opinion has long been that such netting (set-off against affiliates of non-defaulting party) in the US should work within the case of contractual default, but outside of bankruptcy. However, in the special case of legal bankruptcy, such netting (though contractually agreed by the parties) may be challenged. Introducing the fact that one of Enron's entities is a UK entity may further cloud the likelihood. Clearly, if the relationship involves more than on Kaiser entity, netting almost certainly will not work. Has Diana not responded to your credit exposure questions regarding the form of governing confirmation and legal entity? I believe that she is in the US, but should be checking in. Perhaps you should try calling her? I think we will find that the transacting entity is a subsidiary of Kaiser Aluminum. Risk management systems for metals are still not ideal. Volumetric/CVAR type analysis may not yield such reliable results.
