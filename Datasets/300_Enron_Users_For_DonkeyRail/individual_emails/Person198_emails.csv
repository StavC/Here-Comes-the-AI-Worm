"This is the GE ""break-out"" contract. I do not know Brett's timing on signing it. The contract does not contain the ""financing specific"" indemnification provisions, etc. Those will be found in the ""Override Letter"" which will stay in place as long as the turbine contract is in the financing structure. Once the turbines are out of this structure - for instance, if the CAA lenders are taken out by project lenders - the ""Override Letter"" will no longer be in effect and the general, more vanilla ts and cs will apply. I will send you the latest copy of the ""override letter"" also.

"I have made changes for ""97-10"" compliance to the last draft I have of Karen's redline. The gist of the changes is that the Owner is a beneficiary under the contract, but has minimal obligations thereunder. The Construction Manager has most of the obligations, but cannot provide the indemnification EECC is used to seeing from their counterparty. Lisa - there may be spots where you do or do not want the Owner mentioned - I tried to limit it to when the Owner was a beneficiary, but that may strain some of the legal relationships - we may need to change a few of the references. Accounting may have some objections to the way some things are phrased also. I think we can get there with EECC, but it will take some work.

"Team Enron - I spoke with Lisa this morning regarding her comments to the GE language, the substance of which follows. I can discuss this on the call with GE, but I wanted the Enron participants to know what our issues are. 1) Assignment - Generally, if GE is going to require that we list all the possible assignees, the list should be broad enough to encompass the possibilities. The comments below are designed to help make the language as broad and flexible as possible. It would be best if we did not have to list them. A. 22.2(iii) and (iv) - we need to make sure that the definition of ""Facility"" will be generic enough to cover any facility, not merely the one(s) which may be the subject of the particular agreement - also generally we will need to vet any defined term used in our sections to make sure it does not result in greater restriction than we planned ; B. I think we can remove the bracket before 22.2 (iii)(2) and add ""Purchaser"" to the list of folks who can agree to ""convey a power plant project."" Also in that clause, we will need to confirm required ""timing"" of some power plant project development - does it mean only at the time of signing the agreement? It should be for any power plant project in development either at the time of signing the agreement, or any project in development in the future. Insert the number 3 before the last ""and"" in 22.2(iii); C. The paragraph following 22.2(iv)(c) has references to ""(v) and (vi)"" above, which are no ",roseann.engeldorf@enron.com,"kay.mann@enron.com, scott.dieball@enron.com, brian.barto@enron.com,

"Rob made some changes in the e-mail I sent last Friday. He put the info about the Assignment and Assumption Agreement in para. 2 and used more defined terms from the ADA. I think we can use the same A&A agreement to notify WestLB of our intent to assign the P.O. and give notice as to the closing date. However, the current form of A&A agreement has sig. blocks for only ENA and WestLB. Seems like you need a sig. for the assuming party! Particularly since that party is purporting to give notice to WestLB of its intent to pay the purchase price! Rose To effectuate the movement of turbines out of the WestLB LM6000 structures the following needs to take place: 1) ADA - Assignment of the Purchase Option. On at least 5 (five) days notice to WestLB, ENA will assign the Purchase Option for the subject equipment and ancillary agreement to the purchasing entity. This assignment (the ""Assignment"") must release the Lessor (WestLB) from all its obligations under the Turbine Purchase Agreement with respect to the subject equipment and ancillary agreements. This means that GE Packaged Power (a division of GE) and other vendors must release WestLB from its obligations with respect to the subject equipment and contracts. (Kay - Could this be done by an amendment to the scheduled equipment under the various agreements between WestLB and the various vendors? Rose - I believe so, along with entering into the new contracts reference in 3)) The assignment agreement to effect this is explained below",roseann.engeldorf@enron.com,kay.mann@enron.com,"'Rob' : 'person', 'Rose' : 'person', 'Kay' : 'person', 'Rose' : 'person'",4,Turbines Galore,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,sent,roseann.engeldorf@enron.com

"This is the GE ""break-out"" contract. I do not know Brett's timing on signing it. The contract does not contain the ""financing specific"" indemnification provisions, etc. Those will be found in the ""Override Letter"" which will stay in place as long as the turbine contract is in the financing structure.

Rose To effectuate the movement of turbines out of the WestLB LM6000 structures the following needs to take place: 1) ADA - Assignment of the Purchase Option. On at least 5 (five) days notice to WestLB, ENA will assign the Purchase Option for the subject equipment and ancillary agreement to the purchasing entity. This assignment (the ""Assignment"") must release the Lessor (WestLB) from all its obligations under the Turbine Purchase Agreement with respect to the subject equipment and ancillary agreements.

Therefore, either WestLB needs to enter into the agreement with Peoples or Enron can enter into an option agreement. There is room in the WestLB facility for the turbines; however, RAC needs to approve the purchase. Lisa advises that Transaction Support (Herman or Roger) needs to buy in as well. I understand we would like to present a binding agreement to Peoples tomorrow, however, this appears to be problematic given the need to keep the Moore project off the balance sheet.
