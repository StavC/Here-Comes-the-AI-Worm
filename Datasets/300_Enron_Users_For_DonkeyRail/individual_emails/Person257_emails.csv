Extension until this time might require extension of our underlying deal. This would be OK with us. 2. Character of service: The text indicates that PPL would have the right to request deliveries be made to an alternqate point on TW. Why would they want this? This could be a problem if we know the gas wouldn't flow as we would shut in puchases. We would like to make this on a mutually acceptable basis. 3.

"Jeff: Following is a summary of recent EPMI West Power activity with the 3 California utilites PG&E - EEI Master Agreement in place. As part of their recent RFP, we completed 2, 50 MW, 5 year, sale transactions for peak hours at $58.40 and $58.70. They are looking at EOL although they have not transacted on it. They call regularly for shorter dated quotes. We deal with Claudia Grief who works in Joe Henri's group. Overall, we have a very positive relationship and look forward to increasing business. Edison - Almost finished negotiation of a EEI Master Agreement to allow transactions. We are haggling about some credit issues, but expect these to be resolved shortly. We participated in their only RFP. They did not transact with us or, to our knowledge, with others. They got cold feet. We work with Jill Horswell, Sean Baker and Bennie Wu. Since master contracts are not done yet, and no deals have been completed, I would say this relationship is not as good as PG&E but better than SDG&E. I would expect that we will be doing regular cash business by the end of the year. They are looking at EOL. SDG&E - We have participated in 3 RFPs and have not been successful.

"Faith: Here is a spreadsheet that summarizes the individual contributions for West Power Middle Market and West Power Services. A couple thoughts: - Please make sure the dollars are distributed to the individuals so credit is given where credit is due. Although I wish I made the money currently indicated in the tables, obviously the numbers represent the total for all of us. - Services Desk P&L is the responsibility of Greg Wolfe and he is a leading originator for the coverage group. The attached table reflects the sum of both groups. - Some of the contributors to Middle Market West Power are non-commercial (Cocke, Rawson) while others are not technically in the Middle Market Group although the P&L they generate is (Mainzer, Scholtes). - I am concerned that the origination tracking taking place is going to overstate the importance of origination and underestimate the importance of other Middle Market ""Coverage"" behaviors such as number of Master Agreements put in place, number of new accounts brought in, etc. A couple of fairly easy metrics would be: 1) number of EEI/ISDA contracts; 2) number of transactions; 3) number of different counter parties transacting; and 4) number of EOL clients brought in. Quantifying these few items should be relatively simple and go a long way toward measuring coverage.

"Vito: To give you an indication of the current value of your generation, San Juan offers are running about NYMEX less $.20/MMBtu for most forward months.

"Chris -- I am not too optimistic that we are going to get either the CPUC or the California Legislature to provide for competitive default supply. I don't think that the utilities would want it nor do I think that with all of the other problems in California this will occur within the next 12 months. The best chance is simply to get the utilities to recognize (as the call from SCE appears to indicate) that there is price risk with their residual load and to seek to forward contract. We are working (and I think that there is a strong sentiment amongst most California electricity wonks) to remove any barriers to utilities contracting forward. This should put EPMI on a level footing to compete to manage the UDCs price risk with other people in the industry. Government Affairs met today in SF to discuss our goals for the upcoming Legislative session (which promises to be very interesting). Competitive default supply is on the agenda, but I would put it behind utility forward contracting on the list of priorities.

"Chris: I am not a power expert (Sara Shackleton in our group handles the power trades) and would feel better if Christina Yoder took a look at this. I understand he will be back in tomorrow and I have left him a voice mail message about this. With respect to the form of Proposal Letter, I would prefer that you use the form that I have attached. With respect to the proposed Term Sheet, the paragraph before the ""Corrections to Published Prices"" paragraph refers to an Annex A which if this deal is confirmed under an ISDA would not be the correct reference. Also, in the disclaimer at the end, please change all references of ""Williams"" to ""ENA."" Please call me if you have any questions.

"Chris, this sounds good. It would be helpful for us (the overall power business) to have a common set of metrics and reports that evaluate the effectiveness and importance of the mid market effort. I think we all believe this is an important skill or capability that needs to measured and rewarded. Key metrics may include: a)coverage metrics against target customers (ie) customer contact ;b) forward deal flow or hot list; c)completed transactions and origination; and d) EOL customer sign-ons and deal flow.
