Legal is making some minor modifications to the agreement (typos, etc.), but I wanted you to have the opportunity to review the agreement in the meantime. You will notice that it is a binding agreement between EBS and the Counterparties. What EBS askes the counterparties to commit is essentially that they will support the connection and router that they own in accordance with the way that we have engineered the service, and that if they make changes to their network, they will advise us so that we can evaluate the need for any modifications to the setup. Since we are obligated to provide a minimum level of service and a redundant service to the best of our ability, we have to get some commitment from the counterparties in this regard to ensure performance. The agreement furthermore specifies an interconnection order with facility authorization for EBS or its designate to install circuits. The counterparty technical contact should be expecting this language. Meanwhile, we have ordered circuits as we have discussed and are moving down the list of counterparties that have indicated a desire to participate to determine customer-specific network configurations",bob.shults@enron.com,mark.taylor@enron.com,"'Mark' : 'person', 'Bob Shults/HOU/ECT' : 'person', 'David Mims' : 'person', 'Andy Zipper' : 'person', 'Bob Shults' : 'person'",5,Pilot Program Subscriber Agreement,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,sent,bob.shults@enron.com

My comments/questions were: What is the rationale for requiring margin from the broker, given its role as agent for the client? What if the client refuses to accept/acknowledge the trade - I assume the agent is nonetheless liable? The margin will secure the risk between treansaction and confirmation with the counterparty. the broker will pay liquidated damages if counterparty does not accept the trade. (risk is essentially 1-3 days) I assume we will negotiate a fully-fledged agreement with each broker, covering all the usual protections for Enron (indemnities/right of agent to bind its principal/reps and warranties/duties & obligations of agent/liability of agent/margin arrangements) Yes. Mark Taylor is drafting the agreement. the agreement will lay out the margin requirements, liquidated damages, etc. I am not sure that the broker is acting as a agent for the customer as the customer may not even know that the broker is transacting on EnronOnline.

Please pay particuliar attention to Section 3 Transactions.

The confirmations group will be responsible for confirming each day and notifying credit immediately of any discrepancies between Enron and the Broker.

"Bob: Our issues with hedge funds are somewhat complicated. The threshold issue is that they are severely limited by their fundamental documents (the prospectus will spell out what they can invest in) so we have to review those documents before trading. That is more than we do for run-of-the-mill domestic corporates and takes a lot of legal resources that so far have been spent elsewhere. The other issue is more difficult because it is hard to peg down and relates to regulatory uncertainty. About a year ago a major hedge fund (Long Term Capital) got into serious trouble and the regulators stepped in, orchestrating a bail-out. There was much wringing of hands and gnashing of teeth in Washington afterwards and since then there have been a variety of messages coming out of Washington relating to derivatives trading with hedge funds - none of them good. Our view is that the regulators will be paying much closer attention to hedge fund trading of derivatives than in the past and we don't want that spotlight shining on us. [In case you're interested: notwithstanding their name, hedge funds are speculators. Much of the federal regulation of derivatives has assumed that hedging -- as opposed to speculation -- was safer and therefore more palatable. The failure of a large hedge fund might result in damaging ripple effects throughout the financial markets. Hence the regulators' heightened scrutiny.] For both of these reasons, when EnronOnline was launched it was with the internally stated policy that we",mark.taylor@enron.com,bob.shults@enron.com,'Bob' : 'person',1,Re: Hedge Fund and CTA list,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,received,bob.shults@enron.com

The objective of the individual home pages is to allow each commodity group create its own web site (within EnronOnline) and to deliver a more personalized experience for the customers. A significant aspect of the home pages is the addition of content which will be developed at a desk and or company level. The content which we are adding will be much more dynamic and require constant changes. In this light we will need to develop an approval process which protects Enron however does not completely impede our effort to provide current interesting content on the web site. In addition we will need to make sure that we include the neccessary disclaimers to avoid other issues.

"Bob, Thanks for these. My comments/questions were: What is the rationale for requiring margin from the broker, given its role as agent for the client? What if the client refuses to accept/acknowledge the trade - I assume the agent is nonetheless liable? I assume we will negotiate a fully-fledged agreement with each broker, covering all the usual protections for Enron (indemnities/right of agent to bind its principal/reps and warranties/duties & obligations of agent/liability of agent/margin arrangements) I assume that the client will be an approved EOL counterparty with trading access for the particular product We will need to ensure that the client agrees to be bound by each trade concluded through the agent, notwithstanding the intermediation of the agent (it would seem to me that we should create special ETAs/PAs for this purpose - e.g. each trade is effected by the ""click"" of the agent, not the client; the ETA does not contemplate intermediation; the PA relates to the use of passwords by a principal and not its agent) The agent will, in its terms of business with the client, need to ensure that it is authorised to bind the client with respect all trades, whether effected online (including EOL) or offline The agent will need to meet the usual legal/regulatory/financial tests, as if it were acting as principal - e.g. in the case of derivatives trades, the agent must be regulated to carry on its business by the UK SFA [no doubt, the CFTC swap",justin.boyd@enron.com,bob.shults@enron.com,"'Bob' : 'person', 'agent' : 'person', 'client' : 'person', 'client' : 'person', 'agent' : 'person', 'agent' : 'person', 'agent' : 'person', 'agent' : 'person', 'client' : 'person', 'client' : 'person', 'agent' : 'person', 'agent' : 'person', 'agent' : 'person', 'client' : 'person', 'agent' : 'person', 'agent' : 'person', 'client' : 'person', 'client' : 'person', 'agent' : 'person', 'agent' : 'person'",20,Re: Broker Client Process flow,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,received,bob.shults@enron.com

"The system is certainly not set up to accommodate that now but we could probably draft around it on a case by case basis. It strikes me that while we might be able to come up with a legal framework that would allow for this, the credit considerations are more problematic. I would guess that the back office will also be unhappy about having to manually rearrange all of the trades. This really seems like it is similar to the Aquilla problem in some respects. When we suggested allowing one entity to trade for another, Credit was quite concerned because the system wouldn't be able to check the appropriate headroom. I suppose Credit could just assign the lowest headroom for any of the eligible entities to the entire relationship - would that be acceptable to everyone? Another possibility is for the fund to set up a master trading entity which does the trades with us and then does back to back deals with whichever entities need the allocations. That would let them do a large transaction on EOL and then smaller transactions with the other entities. Of course, the master trading entity would need to qualify for credit on its own somehow. Guarantees from anyone other than the owner would be difficult (upstream guarantee problems).

"Bob: Our issues with hedge funds are somewhat complicated. The threshold issue is that they are severely limited by their fundamental documents (the prospectus will spell out what they can invest in) so we have to review those documents before trading. That is more than we do for run-of-the-mill domestic corporates and takes a lot of legal resources that so far have been spent elsewhere. The other issue is more difficult because it is hard to peg down and relates to regulatory uncertainty. About a year ago a major hedge fund (Long Term Capital) got into serious trouble and the regulators stepped in, orchestrating a bail-out. There was much wringing of hands and gnashing of teeth in Washington afterwards and since then there have been a variety of messages coming out of Washington relating to derivatives trading with hedge funds - none of them good. Our view is that the regulators will be paying much closer attention to hedge fund trading of derivatives than in the past and we don't want that spotlight shining on us. [In case you're interested: notwithstanding their name, hedge funds are speculators. Much of the federal regulation of derivatives has assumed that hedging -- as opposed to speculation -- was safer and therefore more palatable. The failure of a large hedge fund might result in damaging ripple effects throughout the financial markets. Hence the regulators' heightened scrutiny.] For both of these reasons, when EnronOnline was launched it was with the internally stated policy that we",mark.taylor@enron.com,bob.shults@enron.com,'Bob' : 'person',1,Re: Hedge Fund and CTA list,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,received,bob.shults@enron.com

"Bob - My initial response is that the amendment can be provided. I am not sure, however, that we satisfy the rationale behind the collateral/lc by doing this. Remember, until the counterparty actually confirms with Enron (or performs the transaction), Enron does not maintain any direct contractual relationship with the Counterparty. All Enron has is a confirmation from the broker, the party with whom we have contracted through the BrokerClient product. In this situation, both the broker and Enron are really in the same position as if the transaction were a telephone trade by a broker. I will give this a bit more thought and discuss possible options with Mark. Maybe it is as simple as obtaining a document from the counterparty under which they acknowledge (1) the broker is authorized to act on its behalf, (2) the relationship is truly one of agent and principal such that the actions of the broker (e.g., transacting online) are really the actions of the counterparty and (3) the counterparty agrees to be liable to Enron as if the counterparty had, itself, performed the transaction online. The last point could be used to tie any breach of a transaction to the master agreement/GTC's between Enron and the counterparty - the same method that is currently employed to calculate the Liquidated Damages under the BETA. Let's talk further next week after I have discussed this with Mark.
