Nymex indicated that they would like to move ahead very quickly on getting a price posting arrangement with them on Access where they will be showing prices all day including the OTC products. Once this is complete they would also like to contemplate an arrangement on a Phase 2 technology sale with them. They are currently scoping our the Phase II requirements. Nymex does not have the resources to build the API (interface with EnronOnline) and would like us to do the development. This type of arrangement requires the desk to make some decisions: Are we willing to post numbers on Access electronically and have the transaction occur on Access? This will give us the risk of being double hit. Are we willing to dedicate technology resources to this effort (and away from other EnronOnline priorities) and will the desk get enough benefits to justify the opportunity costs?

"Looks good. certainly an area we need more focus on. Obviously the most important aspect of lng is how much gas is coming in, what is that relative to last year, and what new capacity is coming longer term. As an aside, nat gas trades as a funciton of the storage spread to last year and five year averages. It would be very useful if all fundamental analysis were geared the same way. The fact that lng shipments are x this week is meaningless. the fact that they are y delta of last year is extremely useful. if you noticed in the fundies meeting, i was trying to move discussion that way. what's switching vis a vis last year. whats production relative to last year. it simplifies the fundamental analysis.

I have been in London since 12/15.I hope the expiry goes smoothly for you. Also I hope your holliday season is going well ( however abridged it is by the NYMEX and Enron) Many of the guys over here asked about nat gas and EOL in the US. I suggested they visit with you when they are over in the US. In particular, Chris Mahoney (gasoil trader) will be in Houston the 27 t0 30. I told him he should come and watch you deal with the AGA number and NX1 at the same time. Chris is a really good guy. His team loves him and will definitely play a large role in turning the crude and products group around. Anyway you were a great pal over the last 12 months and gave me a lot of good advice. I do miss listening to the banter on the gas floor (and the gambling!), but there are a lot of good people in crude and products (especially in London) and I think we will be able to deliver on the goods. I think you are wonderful and I'm very happy we had the chance to work together. Happy New Year! Jen PS I am coming back on the 6th.

"hey man no problem.i know youre a busy man.its getting ahrder to say how to play this thing. sprds are massive contango-minimal inverses in the winter. indeed there shudnt be any problems to supply gas this winter but suply growth hasnt been stellar and prob wont rise from here now.im not a raging bull but the past couple of aga and the cashs trength. and the mkt structure(no sellers in the forward), leads me to beleive there cud be more upside. mkt is prob a range mkt for a time. but overall i think this is a weather bet. if we have a winter it will suport the whole curve if its warm i will be awful-stay in that 2.00-2.50 rnage for spot prices. i think the prompt is out of the woods-if so long as we have normal weather nov cash will be ok -wont trade lower than oct cash as long as we have big incentive to roll storage mar/apr? i bailed. basically washed. in the long term its prob ok but they arent gonna let me make any serious money on it in the next few weeks prob longer so why have it on esp when this winter is such a big discount to next-i guess theres some risk h/j moves higher if they y on y sprds come in much?? not sure so i bailed. i dont disagree with you on the calender sprds but i just dont think the entry pt is attractive. about the only thing im running is nov long agais",steve.lafontaine@bankofamerica.com,john.arnold@enron.com,"'man' : 'person', 'i' : 'person', 'i' : 'person', 'i' : 'person', 'i' : 'person'",5,RE: wheres the love?,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,received,john.arnold@enron.com

"John, Following up on yesterday, there are two additional considerations. First, with regard to the idea of curtailing gas input at the Topock liquefaction plant, the pipeline bottleneck is actually downstream of the plant, so that wouldn't help. Second, it seems there are more of these ""portable pipeline"" units floating around than I thought. Besides the inoperable unit in Amarillo, both Transgas (in Massachusetts) and Minnigasco may have at least one. Moreover, PG&E has one at the end of a long lateral line on its system just south of Sacramento. Apparently it uses it mostly to augment linepack. The specs of that unit are about 4 times higher than the Amarillo one: it puts out 400,000 cubic feet/hour (about 9.6 mmcf/d or almost one contract) at 150 psi. As I said yesterday, these units are the only way that you could get gas into the pipeline system in California. This information I got from Jeff Beale, who runs CH-IV, a small-scale LNG consultant. He said that he'd had some similar calls about LNG, and also that he'd be willing to help Enron source equipment if we were really interested in looking further into transporting LNG into California. Assuming that we could get a few ""portable pipelines"" and some trucks, there are five liquefaction plants that could most conveniently supply LNG: Location Owner Liquefaction Capacity (gal/day) Capacity (mmcf/d) Storage (gal) Storage (mmcf) Topock, AZ El",russell.dyk@enron.com,john.arnold@enron.com,"'John' : 'person', 'Jeff Beale' : 'person', 'Topock, AZ' : 'postal code'",3,LNG to California,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,received,john.arnold@enron.com

Christopher's Wine Warehouse was named the ""BEST WINE STORE"" on page 97 of the September 20-26, 2001 issue. We are thankful to all our loyal friends and neighbors for this recognition of our hard work and dedication to bringing the best wines we can find to Houston's wine lovers. Thanks again for your continued support. We will continue to work hard with our unique selection to, hopefully, be honored again next year. As for the schedule this week, I believe we have perfected our website so that everyone can now view our tastings. We have two versions of the site, one in very easy to navigate form, and one that sings and dances if you have the necessary plug ins. If you don't want to re configure your system, just click on the normal site when you visit us at:www.christopherswine.com . EVERY day this week, starting tomorrow (Tuesday the 25th), we will be hosting our wine tastings. The topics, prices per person, etc, etc, are posted at our site and include the weekly schedules through October. REMEMBER: YOU MUST CALL US TO RESERVE AT 713-524-9144.

"John, here is a power point slide that provides a draft outline of the problem at hand. It is very draft in nature but I wanted to get the working version over to you ASAP. I wanted to get this discussion going via written format so that I (or others who may implement this) can stay focused on what you want and not get into broader research, etc.... I think I can put a model together if we can define what parameters, the interface (levers) and model (transfer functions) to use that would be useful for you as phase I product. I will fire off updates to this document as I make them. If you have a spec doc or ideas that you want to hand write on a print out, please do so and I will update the document. I will like to make sure that I am on the same page before beginning to code the program and to start linking to additional moths (month 2, 3, ..) and different curves, etc. My Job search has gone well with the Crude desk and I am waiting compensation indication from them to make my decision. Also, Kevin Presto feels that I could potentially help his power group with new market or spread trading. John Suarez is a director who came from the power desk to EBS is going back to work for Kevin Presto. I may have an opportunity to build the southeast market by supporting John.

"Aren't you used to me popping in every few years by now?? And are you calling me wacky?? =) Basically, I just started working for a new-ish hedge fund in Boston with Chuck Clough, the former Chief Investment Strategist for Merrill. I got a random phone call yesterday from a woman who is just starting a hedge fund here in Boston. She had heard I was in town and has been trying to get a hold of me to help her start her hedge fund. She finally got my number from someone, who told her I had already started working with Chuck. I'm not sure why she called me anyway, but she basically tried to convince me what a great opportunity it would be to work with her and her ""team."" The only person on her ""team"" that she described was Jeff Gossett. She said that she and her husband had hired him out of Southwest Texas undergrad and he had stayed with her first fund for four years (which she subsequently sold) until Enron recruited him away. The stories of the recruitment seemed a bit wild, like using private jets to fly him to Europe. Anyway, she said that he had quit Enron two weeks ago to join her in this new hedge fund. Having never heard of him and thinking she seemed to be a bit of a crackpot, I was wondering if it was true. I would never leave this opportunity, even if she offered me the world, but I have friends who really want to break into hedge funds, so I was doing some due diligence on ",hrobertson@cloughcapital.com,john.arnold@enron.com,"'Chuck Clough' : 'person', 'woman' : 'person', 'number' : 'phone number', 'Jeff Gossett' : 'person'",4,RE: Hello!,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,received,john.arnold@enron.com
