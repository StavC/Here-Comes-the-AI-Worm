You need to look at the entire Midtex line for each of the days that are out of balance. If we are short at Katy, I would think that we would be long at Dewville. (Many times, our receipts from the Midtex line at Katy are offset by our deliveries to Tufco at the Tap.) This should help you fix the January problem. Also, for December, you may need to ask PG&E where they show the delivery for Western. Is it at HPL Katy, as our records show, or is it at PGE's another point on the Midtex line? In any case, we don't have deliveries to make. The only other remedy is to book the variance on the partnership imbalance.
