Due to a couple of the interconnects constrained into NWPL due to high hydrocarbons there is only one delivery point available to flow into NWPL (Foundation Creek). They are holding space for actual producers behind Foundation Creek to flow into NWPL and the remaining 40% of capacity for the other producers. Cresendo's pro-rata share into NWPL would be 1,000 MMbtu/day. Interruptible transport is flowing into NWPL. Liz also said they are very close to having the Grand Valley point back in spec for quality which will increase our flow into NWPL up to 2,000 MMBtu/day. She's hopeful for the end of the week for this increase. The meter number on NWPL for Foundation Creek is Map Pt. 56 (meter 48010 on Wildhorse). We will be trying 1,000 for tomorrow's gas day into NWPL and will keep everyone informed when we can",joan.quick@enron.com,"scott.josey@enron.com, mark.castiglione@enron.com, arvel.martin@enron.com,

Our Interruptible noms to NWPL for Wed. were not cut due to contractual reasons, we were cut due to a lack of capacity. He said that the San Arroyo #2 compressor was down and without it they cannot make additional deliveries to NWPL. They hope to have it up by friday and will try to provide us some capacity into NWPL. 2. Kent reiterated their position regarding our contract by stating that ""the intent of the original contract was not to take gas through other systems other than the Mesa system"". In addition he stated that we do not have the right to choose which pipeline our gas is delivered to. 3. He also asked whether or not we were willing to negotiate on the current situation or if we wanted to let the 'lawyers fight it out"".

"""Oil"" means crude off, condensate and other liquid hydrocarbons meeting the quality standards and specifications set forth in Article VI hereof. also, do we even need this definition? ***************************************** I don't think so--John was going to do a search.

"""Oil"" means crude off, condensate and other liquid hydrocarbons meeting the quality standards and specifications set forth in Article VI hereof. also, do we even need this definition? ***************************************** I don't think so--John was going to do a search. ""Payment Date"" means, for or with respect to any Month, the last LIBOR Business Day of the next following Month. For example, February 28, 2001 is the Payment Date for the Month of January 2001. i think this reads better if we say: ""Payment Date"" means, for or with respect to any Month, the last LIBOR Business Day of the Month following the production Month. For example, February 28, 2001 is the Payment Date for the production Month of January 2001. ***************************************** Read Section 8.1 where the term is used for payment--it works as is. Section 3.3. Enforcement of Production Payment Documents. Seller shall take all actions as may be appropriate to abide by the provisions of the Production Payment Documents and enforce the provisions of the Production Payment Documents against the Producer. Seller shall not amend any Production Payment Document in any material respect without the consent of Buyer. once again, i think this should state, that consent is only needed when amending something that will change any of the items tied to the Confirm - term, price, volume... we should be able to change capex, or even the oil vols... w/o consent. ***************************************** As long as we are GP of Brazos or the Servicer, this is OK--we can advise them informally--""prior written"" has been deleted and ENA will not",teresa.bushman@enron.com,joan.quick@enron.com,"'John' : 'person', 'Seller' : 'person', 'Seller' : 'person', 'Buyer' : 'person'",4,Re: Master Natural Gas Purchase and Sale Agreement,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,received,joan.quick@enron.com

"Joan, The BOA ticket was established by John Griffith.
