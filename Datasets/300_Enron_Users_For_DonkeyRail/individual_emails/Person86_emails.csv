Definition of Agreement - I am not aware of the term ""annexures"" - I assume it is the equivalent of ""annexes"". 3. Section 2.4.1 Should we specify the size and location of the Enron Link? and the Sports.com link? 4. Section 4.2 ""Enron"" should be deleted before the phrase ""in the event"". 5. Section 8.1 The word ""form"" should be changed to ""from"". 6. Section 8.2.2 The phrase ""will be made available"" should be deleted. 7. I do not know the creditworthiness of Sports.com, but should we require that they maintain general liability insurance to back up the indemnities which they are providing us. 8.

I know we add text to the headlines when we give Reuters credit for them (hence the '[Reuters . . .'). Do you think we can get by with adding the time for the headlines? About the stock quotes, what do you think? I think the way it's currently set out makes it looks like the price on the stock market at 21:35 is exactly 68.61 for ENE. This is okay only if (i) that actually is the case (i.e., it's a Reuters time stamp from NYSE and not our own) and (ii) we're allowed to do that in the contract. What's the verdict?
