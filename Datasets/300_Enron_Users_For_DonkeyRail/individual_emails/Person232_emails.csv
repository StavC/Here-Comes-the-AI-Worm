IT WAS IN THE SUN. Blair to let EU arrest Brits By GEORGE -PASCOE-WATSON Deputy Political Editor TONY Blair was last night slammed for handing EU judges the power to arrest British citizens on trumped-up charges over laws which do not EXIST in the UK. The PM will sign up to an EU-wide arrest warrant today - despite warnings that it is open to abuse and a massive surrender of power. It will mean that anyone can be seized and handed over to a EU country to face trial, even if they have done nothing wrong under British laws. Last night the International Federation of Human Rights Leagues said British citizens will be at the mercy of third rate legal systems like Greece and Portugal. Vice President Michel Tubiana said: ""It presupposes that all judicial systems function well. ""All you can say with certainty is that NO system functions perfectly. ""One cannot rule out the possibility that the European arrest warrant could be widened to other crimes, or abused. ""There is no guarantee preventing this."" Last night Downing Street brushed off the attack and insisted Mr Blair will OK the deal.

"Bill, As per our conversation today, I am sending you an outline of what we intend to be doing in Ercot and in particular on the real-time desk. For 2002 Ercot is split into 4 zones with TCRs between 3 of the zones. The zones are fairly diverse from a supply/demand perspective. Ercot has an average load of 38,000 MW, a peak of 57,000 MW with a breakdown of 30% industrial, 30% commercial and 40% residential. There are already several successful aggregators that are looking to pass on their wholesale risk to a credit-worthy QSE (Qualified Scheduling Entity). Our expectation is that we will be a fully qualified QSE by mid-March with the APX covering us up to that point. Our initial on-line products will include a bal day and next day financial product. (There is no day ahead settlement in this market). There are more than 10 industrial loads with greater than 150 MW concentrated at single meters offering good opportunities for real-time optimization. Our intent is to secure one of these within the next 2 months. I have included some price history to show the hourly volatility and a business plan to show the scope of the opportunity. In addition, we have very solid analytics that use power flow simulations to map out expected outcomes in the real-time market. The initial job opportunity will involve an analysis of the real-time market as it stands today with a view to trading around our information. This will also drive which specific assets we approach to manage. As we are loosely combining our Texas gas and Ercot",doug.gilbert-smith@enron.com,bill.williams@enron.com,'Bill' : 'person',1,ERCOT opportunities,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,sent,doug.gilbert-smith@enron.com

"Frank, Please can you verify for John that this change to VaR makes sense from your perspective given your independent analysis of the price curves. The existing VaR calculation assumes a power to gas correlation in Texas of 47% and the empirical evidence shows something in the order of 93%. I believe that, while we have provided this data, you and Mike have found it to be accurate and agree that VaR should drop by the amount stated below. I realize that, in order to process this change company wide you need to recalculate all the associated matrices and your group is working on that. In the meantime, as this is a material change to the East Power VaR, I would appreciate it if you could convey this to John so that he is aware of the change and is comfortable that it is not simply driven by the Desk but is a reflection of your work following our discussions relating to Power/Gas correlations in ERCOT.

"Danielle, Thank you for the invitation to discuss scheduling activities for the month of August. As I am sure you are aware this company is undergoing a significant period of turmoil. It would therefore be of great help if you could send a list of specific questions so that we may be able to answer them directly. If it would aid your understanding of our activity, we have full requirement obligations in both the North and South zones that were to ramp up starting in July. This load was to reach in excess of 100 MW by September. However, the speed of switching and the location of this load were not known. In addition, we have resources off 2 power plants, both located in the South. One of these plants is consistently subjected to various types of command and control dispatch by the ISO and we are obligated to find a market for any residual energy. I trust this paints a picture of what we do and can help clarify any questions you may have. At this time, I do not feel we are in a position to comment on the actions of other QSEs as any information we have would be purely anecdotal.

"Bill, As per our conversation today, I am sending you an outline of what we intend to be doing in Ercot and in particular on the real-time desk. For 2002 Ercot is split into 4 zones with TCRs between 3 of the zones. The zones are fairly diverse from a supply/demand perspective. Ercot has an average load of 38,000 MW, a peak of 57,000 MW with a breakdown of 30% industrial, 30% commercial and 40% residential. There are already several successful aggregators that are looking to pass on their wholesale risk to a credit-worthy QSE (Qualified Scheduling Entity). Our expectation is that we will be a fully qualified QSE by mid-March with the APX covering us up to that point. Our initial on-line products will include a bal day and next day financial product. (There is no day ahead settlement in this market). There are more than 10 industrial loads with greater than 150 MW concentrated at single meters offering good opportunities for real-time optimization. Our intent is to secure one of these within the next 2 months. I have included some price history to show the hourly volatility and a business plan to show the scope of the opportunity. In addition, we have very solid analytics that use power flow simulations to map out expected outcomes in the real-time market. The initial job opportunity will involve an analysis of the real-time market as it stands today with a view to trading around our information. This will also drive which specific assets we approach to manage. As we are loosely combining our Texas gas and Ercot",doug.gilbert-smith@enron.com,bill.williams@enron.com,'Bill' : 'person',1,ERCOT opportunities,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,sent,doug.gilbert-smith@enron.com

"Jim, I have just reviewed Tabors' proposal for a hybrid solution to RTOs and I do not feel that, at this point in time, this does the ERCOT desk any good whatsoever. It is simply a continuation of what the PUC has already seen from his counterpart, Dr Oren, and does not meet my expectations for a feasible market. I have not been impressed with Tabors understanding of our trading business and do not feel that this latest model forwards our efforts at all. The purpose of the meeting on the 15th is to review the real-time congestion management mechanisms currently proposed and not a forward hybrid market. If we have two associates who are saying the same thing we do not achieve our goal of changing this situation. Furthermore, it simply means we end up signing on to a flawed market design which, I am sure, is not in anyone's best interest; commercially or politically! We have not been implicated in the failings of California's design because we did not sign up to the initial proposal there. It would be very foolish to sign up now to an equally flawed model. I would like to have a quick meeting to discuss this so that we can forge ahead with the ERCOT gameplan. I will not accept a bastardised version of the current proposals as a solution for this market. It does not allow either EES or ENA to operate productively and will ultimately fail. I am confident we can get over any hesitations we have using other market experts to present the case and I know that there has been",doug.gilbert-smith@enron.com,"james.steffes@enron.com, richard.shapiro@enron.com","'Jim' : 'person', 'Tabors' : 'person', 'Dr Oren' : 'person', 'Tabors' : 'person'",4,Tabors visit to ERCOT,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,sent,doug.gilbert-smith@enron.com

"Doug I just sent this to Lloyd. Appreciate your confidence on the matter...as you can see not everybody is onside with things. Unbalanced schedules go hand in hand with LMP - logically we won't/can't get unbalanced schedules in ERCOT without admitting we favor LMP for dispatch. We can and will minimize this point during the discussion about balanced/unbalanced schedules but eventually one leads to the other. Anyway the way in which LMP uses price signals to clear congestion is in our commercial interests.

"Please find attached spreadsheet that compares hot days from May 2000 and May 2001. There are two tabs, one tab contains the days May 16-18, 2000 and the other tab contains the days May 14-18, 2001. Each tab contains both the load data and temp data particular to the days in question. The days most directly comparable are May 17, 2001 (Thursday) and May 18, 2000 (Thursday), although the two days preceding May 18, 2000 were slightly warmer than the two days preceding May 17, 2001. The peak on 5/17/2001, 44,923 MW, is 2.78% higher than the peak on 5/18/2000, 43,709 MW. With similarly warm days before 5/17/2001 as there were before 5/18/2000, the peak would obviously have been even higher. This would put the year-over-year growth in excess of 3%. I believe this falls right in line with the growth rate year-over-year from an earlier analysis, somewhere in the range of 3.5% to 4%.

"Doug -- Following up on our discussion, attached is the single definition of ERCOT Unplanned B product currently traded on EOL.

Attached is a Performance Improvement Plan for your employee(s) who rated in the bottom cluster. The steps below outline the instructions for completing this form. If you have any questions, please contact your HR Representative - Supervisors are encouraged to consider employee input before finalizing the PIP. - The PIP should address the specific performance areas and examples provided in the employee's evaluation. - All PIP's should be reviewed by your Human Resources generalist before being presented to the employee. Performance/Development Area: This is the specific area in which the employee's demonstrated performance needs to improve, or a significant area where additional development is needed. These should be stated in specific, objective, and behavioral terms. Common descriptors have been provided for the supervisor to copy/paste into the Performance Improvement Plan or to modify as needed. See attachment. Specific Action Required: The desired behavior or action of employee. This should usually be a goal or milestone that can be measured or evaluated. Completion Date: Each specific action in the PIP will require varying time periods for completion. Some improvement areas may need to be immediate, such as reducing absenteeism or eliminating inappropriate comments. Other areas will take longer for the employee to complete, such as enhancing technical knowledge.

The definition of UB itself makes clear this product is firm, and the term ""Undelivered"" currently carries the meaning that Buyer must be capable of moving the firm energy from the Delivery Point to more than one potential destination.

"There are two displays on the Portal: View Commercially Significant Constraints (display 1) and View Congestion Notification. Whenever there is a CSC violation on the Commercially Significant Constraints display, the Congestion Notification display will specifically list this violation. These two displays are consistent and updated hourly. The MW loading on each CSC is calculated as MW loading from each zone = (Sum of Resources in the same zone - Sum of Scheduled Load in the same zone)* shift factor The sum of resources is calculated based on QSE's energy schedules and the sum of load is calculated based on the QSE's scheduled load for each zone. However, the real-time BES uses resource scheduled based on QSE's resource plan and ERCOT short-term load forecast. Therefore what is posted on the Portal may be different from the CSC calculation from real-time balancing clearing. That's why for interval ending 1:15 the different zonal MCPEs could not be explained by just using these two displays. As you can see we still have a lot of work ahead of us, especially on the Portal postings. Please let me know if you need anything else.

"Doug, I had two very positive meetings this evening with Tom Martin and Jim Schwieger. They are looking for a Carthage Hub physical trader. Tom is planning on talking I think to Lavorato to discuss the details. It's interesting because with the HPL sale now their physical guys are moving into an environment where they don't have an asset to trade around and have to be flat daily. Gee, I wonder what that's like? Given ERCOT liquidity and vol I had to chuckle on the inside (welcome to the real world). I really appreciate your support during all of this. Some bosses could consider a situation like this a slight against them and bear out their resentment personally or to others to stymie that person's movement. You have been nothing but a class act in that regard, and although I indeed would have liked a look at the ST-ERCOT book, I don't hold that against you. In fact I don't even hold it against management. It's no different than trading. Just because someone smart is selling it doesn't mean it won't get bid up and run through them. I am confident that wherever I end up I will be successful -- no different than any other time in my life. I don't know another way. The one time that I had some short-term hardship last year, you and I agree that I was sold too early, and that too will become self-evident.

The prevailing feeling was that there is no reason to start dereg if the systems cannot handle it. To their credit, however, the politicians stated that we need to know this sooner rather than later as there are significant ramifications if we are to delay it. The committee was cognizant of the financial exposure and also the erosion of public confidence in the event of a further delay. The speed of completing customer switching is expected to ramp up now so that all pilot customers will be switched by mid to late Oct. That leaves one billing cycle before dereg. So, the latest we should know there is going to be a delay is Thanksgiving.
