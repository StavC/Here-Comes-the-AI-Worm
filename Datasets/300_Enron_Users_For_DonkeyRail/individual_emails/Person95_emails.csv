"On the first point the reference to a ""municipal plant"" did not disclose whether it was a legal body corporate. That fine if the check has been made. As far as the US$6m min asset level is concerned it does not specifically relate to Australia counterparties (ie those incorporated in Australia). It relates to companies with whom we trade Australian power irrespective of place of incorporation. Under our power trading licence requirements we are required to take reasonable steps to satisfy ourselves that we are dealing with non-retail type investors. There is a check list in the licence of requirements , the most relevant for companies not trading in Australia is the AUD10m (US$6m) in ""tangible assets"". Tana thank you for your offer. You are really doing an excellent job pulling together a huge amount of information in such an effective. I am loath to do anything that would make your job any more difficult.

"Paul further to my email/voicemail on our attempts to get an Exempt Market Declaration issued to Enron Australia Finance Pty Ltd (EAF). I now have a specific request to put to you. It appears that we would qualify for such a Declaration thereby allowing EAF to use the safe harbour provisions under the Australian Corporations Law for trading through EnronOnline if EAF had get a guarantee from Enron Europe Finance and Trading Ltd. We would be able to take advantage of a specific provision in the policy guideline of the Australian Securities and Investments Commission on the grant of Declarations known as Policy Statement 70. (Below is a summary of the relevant provisions of the Policy Statement.) Would the provision of such a guarantee be possible? Clearly an issue to consider would be any possible impact on EEFT's prudential requirements under the Financial Services Act. If this were an issue perhaps could it be overcome if there was a back to back guaranty from say Enron Corp. to EEFT. This mean that effectively EEFT would have no additional exposure. > > > Paragraph 50(c) of Policy Statement 70 provides that persons authorised to > carry on investment business under the Financial Services Act of the > United Kingdom (other than persons who are ""low risk firms"" for the > purposes of the Financial Supervision Rules 1990 issued by the Securities > Investment Board) will be regulated facility providers.

"Mark I would like to thank you for your review of our draft product description. The benefit of your experience is invaluable in assisting us to develop our forms. I had a couple of reservations about some changes you proposed. In particular the changes to the Swap product description would involve the Fixed and Floating Price in each Calculation Period (half hour) being averaged over a Settlement or Determination Period. The payment obligation would then be multiplied by the Notional Quantity Per Settlement Period to get the amount payable on the Settlement Date. This not the way electricity derivatives are traded on the Australian electricity pool. In addition to being inconsistent with the terminology both within our documentation and industry agreed forms we would have difficulty in having this new trading form adopted by the market. In brief, in Australia electricity trades occur in the following manner: - Trades are calculated on the basis of discrete half hourly Calculation Periods. - Payment obligations for these Calculation Periods are then aggregated on Settlement Date each month. The Settlement Date is defined as the day each month when parties are obliged to make payments under the National Electricity Code. - It is the market custom for the Notional Quantity to be quoted in MWs. This number is then divided in half to calculate to convert it into MWhs, which becomes the Notional Quantity per Calculation Period. (To ensure its consistency with market practice we have determined that amounts should be quoted in MWs then converted in this manner into MWhs.",david.minns@enron.com,david.forster@enron.com,'Mark I' : 'person',1,Re: Australian Power: EOL Long Form Description,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,sent,david.minns@enron.com

"This will indeed be a St Patrick's Day for us to remember in years to come. Now that I am back in the office from Adelaide let me give some more considered replies. It appears there has been a bit a communication mix-up no doubt not helped by me being out of the office. So l let me go back to the beginning. Enron Australia Finance Pty. Ltd. is authorised to trade Australian power derivatives with counterparties so long as it follows certain procedures laid out by the Government. These require "" that before entering into a contract with a counterparty, the registered facility provider (ie Enron Australia Finance) must be satisfied on reasonable grounds: (a) about the creditworthiness of the counterparty; and (b) that the counterparty is contracting on its own account."" This obligation is imposed on EAF and makes no difference whether the counterparty has an Australian presence or not. In the case of EAF there was also a requirement for us to provide counterparties with an Enron Corp. guaranty. (Although this strict legal obligation provision was deleted in July 1999.) Hence one of the issues that was addressed in our legal checklist was a procedure to vet potential counterparties. We have procedures in place in the Sydney office to do this. I understood that this activity would still be done in Sydney ie our list of 26 counterparties. the alternative was to develop procedures if it was to done else where. On Tuesday we will submitt the formal notification we need to make to the Australian Securities and Investments Commission that we are adopting a screen based trading",david.minns@enron.com,heidi.mason@enron.com,'I' : 'person',1,Re: Australian Status,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,sent,david.minns@enron.com

Quite the contrary we see the grant of the Exempt Market Declaration as critical and appreciate their efforts to date. (Considering Paul Q's well known aversion to blunt talking I thought it wise to foreshadow what we wanted to cover, as follows.) We understand that unless we can comply with the exact requirements of Policy Statement 70 (para 50) then ASIC believes it is required to make new policy and could not act within the time frame we require. The Minister's office indicated he could not attend the launch of a product that was the subject of an EMD application. Withdrawing the application whilst we clarify the credit issues would remove this timing pressure from ASIC.

"Tana, thanks for expediting this Tana. The list for Australian weather is fine. As I mentioned I will be following up with credit on the collateral requirementsfor some counterparties. On Japanese weather I would suggest we do not load up the following Ergon, Macquarie Generation and Snowy . These are government power utilities and their ability to trade in products not linked to their business is limited. Hence they should be only trading Australian power and weather. Also I would ask that Citipower be restricted to Australian power and weather. They are a Trust and the Trust Deed grants the trustee the power to trade devivatives to hedge its Australian power operations. I would like to check this one out further.

"David, Thanks for your email. I noted a few points which I hope may be helpful: - re: your comment: ""Obviously we are in a position to have different GTCs for different counterparties"" - Please note that we are able to carry up to two versions of the GTC Online - One with the collateral clause and one without - and the assignment of GTC has been done by the credit dept. based on creditworthiness of the customer. Of course, this does not impact our ability to enter into separate Master Agreements or side letters which amend the terms of the GTC for specific customers - we just can't carry copies of this amendment electronically on EnronOnline. - Will you look after registering EnronOnline as a business name? - I have asked Paul Goddard to check regarding the trademarking activities and internet domain registration undertaken so far for EnronOnline in Australia. - Can you provide some details as to the criteria required in assessing the ""Exempt Futures Market Declaration""? Does this apply to ourselves as well as our customers? Will we need to incorporate this into our review of Australian customers and/or any customers outside of Australia who wish to trade Australian power (if any)? - Please note that the new EnronOnline home page screen states ""EnronOnline prices are firm"". I assume this does not cause any problems for Austrlian law regarding the legal definition of ""Invitation to Treat"", ""Offer"" and ""Acceptance""? Please note also the related information on the ""Click for Details"" link on the homepage. - The comments in the Mallesons document regard",david.forster@enron.com,david.minns@enron.com,"'David' : 'person', 'email' : 'email', 'Paul Goddard' : 'person'",3,Re: EnronOnline,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,received,david.minns@enron.com

I am the lead contact in ENA Legal for counterparty approvals and day to day trading issues for EnronOnline. I coordinate responses for the whole Legal Trading Group (financial, physical, power and emerging markets) with the EnronOnline and Credit teams. I understand from my EnronOnline team that I am going to need to approve financial trading for all my Houston based counterparties a week from Friday. Right now that list stands at about 600 counterparties (already trading). I was hoping you could direct me as to what restrictions, if any, we might have for financial trading in Australia. Are there any restricted counterparties, such as governmentals, utilities, banks, dealers, etc., or any restrictions on the products traded (initially I know we are only trading financial power, although I'm sure the list will expand over time). Have your GTC's been drafted with cross-border trading in mind? Similarly, I assume there will be Australian counterparties signing up to trade, and the commercial team will want them approved to trade the whole range of EnronOnline products. Are there any provisions we must add to the form of North American product GTCs if our counterparties trade a North American product from Australia? Do we have any tax issues or language we need to cover? Our standard form of GTC includes New York law and arbitration. Will that be enforceable in Australia?

"David, Can you forward a copy to me of your current GTC? I note that the language is similar to other EnronOnline Products, which is good for consistency. However, I note that there has been a subsitution of Calculation Period where other products use Determination Period. However, I gather that for power, Calculation Period is 1/2 hour, whereas for other Products, Determination Period is generally one month. I hope this does not cause problems if the GTC language has been borrowed from other Products. Would the following amendments clarify the MW/Mwh/Calculation Period relationship? Current: The Counterparty will submit a volume in megawatts (MW) via EnronOnline. This number will be divided in half to convert it into MWh. This number will be used to calculate the Notional Quantity per Calculation Period. Suggestion: The Counterparty will submit a volume in megawatts (MW) via EnronOnline. This number will be divided in half to convert it into total MWh delivered in each 1/2 hour Calculation Period, which shall be the Notional Quantity. Current: The Index shall be the spot price at the Victoria . . . Suggestion: The Index shall be the spot price published for each 1/2 hour at the Victoria . . .

"Several things are not very clear to me and I need to run them by you. 1. From your email it appears to me that there would be no legal reason prohibiting your Australian based counterparties from trading all of the products we offer, however, except for financial Australian power, the contracting Enron entity will have to be the party referenced on the particular product. It appears that the only product Credit has currently opened the Australian based counterparties to trade anyway is Australian financial power. 2. Will you be approving the Australian based counterparties for trading? Dave Forster appears to want me to approve Australian based counterparties too, which doesn't make sense to me and Mark Taylor. What are your thoughts on this? I guess EnronOnline just does not want a third Legal contract they are going to have to deal with on an ongoing basis. FYI, I currently do not approve the London based counterparties. 3. The Australian company number. Does that have to go on every confirmation done with an Australian counterparty? If it does we will need to make sure that it gets put on every confirmation. It is my understanding that the confirmations for online trading will be generated from Houston so we will have to provide every company number to the Houston Confirmation Desk. FYI, tomorrow at the end of the day is my drop dead time to get all the counterparies approved, because the information will have to be loaded in by London when they arrive for work Friday morning.",tana.jones@enron.com,david.minns@enron.com,"'email' : 'email', 'Dave Forster' : 'person', 'Mark Taylor' : 'person'",3,Online Trading,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,received,david.minns@enron.com

Will we need to incorporate this into our review of Australian customers and/or any customers outside of Australia who wish to trade Australian power (if any)? - Please note that the new EnronOnline home page screen states ""EnronOnline prices are firm"".

"David, I am attaching my September 9, 1999 memo on the tax issues associated with the financial trader in Sydney. It clearly summarizes not only our internal discussions at that time but also the advice that PWC-Sydney gave regarding using a mark-up. Please let me know when you and Heidi would be available to discuss the mark-up in more detail so that we can quickly resolve this issue and execute the agreement.

"David, Mark Taylor asked me to talk to you about getting your ISDA Masters inputted into our Financial Trading Database. This databse is the central master database where we keep records of the financial agreements in either draft form or that have been executed. London currently updates this database to manage its (and Singapore's) financial contracts and I would like to get the Australian agreements plugged into the system. This database serves a number of purposes. First, it is our core memory of contract negotiations. Anyone in Legal and Credit around the world can take a look at this database and determine who we have entered into contract with and what negotiation issues may be at issue. It is critical as we become a global trading company that we are consistent in the legal positions we take on these financial contracts. For instance, it would be quite problematic if someone in Houston was negotiating a contract with an ISDA counterparty and asserted that a certain position was critical, if we find out a lawyer in another office was negotiating with the same counterparty and gave on the same position the day before. We need to make a somewhat coordinated effort on the counterparty front. In addition, with so many masters and so many counterparties there is just no way to keep track of what we have said or done unless we have a database. Further, we use the information in the database to respond to inside auditing, reporting and insurance inquiries. For online trading, I check the database to see if we have a financial master agreement and what trading restrictions we may or may not have in place.",tana.jones@enron.com,david.minns@enron.com,"'David' : 'person', 'Mark Taylor' : 'person'",2,Financial Trading Legal Database,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,received,david.minns@enron.com

"David and Heidi, Hope you enjoyed your Easter holiday and your Anzac holiday! With respect to your question of whether the financial trader services can = be=20 charged at cost or must have a 7.5% mark-up, I received advice from Chris= =20 Catt at PWC-Sydney last summer that there needed to be a mark-up for these= =20 services. Given the skills required by the financial trader and the risk= =20 associated with the transactions, Chris advised that there needed to be a= =20 mark-up over cost based on a recent ruling by the ATO. The ATO issued TR 1999/1 in January 1999, which provides a safe-harbor for = de=20 minimis services that are provided by an Australian company and meet certai= n=20 monetary limitations. Under the de miminis safe harbor, where the costs=20 associated with all services provided by Enron Australia Pty Limited to=20 offshore affiliates do not exceed A$500,000 in a year, the safe harbor=20 mark-up of 7.5% may be available. Paragraph 86 of the ruling sets forth th= e=20 requirements as follows: ""As mentioned in paragraph 77, the Commissioner will apply a similar=20 administrative practice in de minimis cases where the total direct and=20 indirect costs of supplying services to Australian or foreign associated=20 enterprises, as appropriate, is not more than $500,000 in a year.

"Today we will: 1) Upload the GTC today with the revision noted below 2) Update the Australian Customer Profiles in accordance with the completed Credit/Legal/Contracts review. 3) Update the non-Australian Customer Profiles such that non-Australian customers have only read access.

Note: It is highly desireable to avoid making changes to GTC's once they are published - and certainly once they have been accepted by a company (i.e. a company which does not already have a signed Master Agreement with Enron), as this requires an awkward change notification process.
