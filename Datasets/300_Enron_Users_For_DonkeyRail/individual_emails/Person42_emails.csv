"Attached is FERC authorization for EPMI and EES to purchase power from industrials NATIONWIDE (effective March 6, 2001--Does not expire). The industrial does not have to obtain its own power marketer license from FERC (subject to EPMI and EES making certain after the fact quarterlty filings for the industrials). Specifics: Owners of generating facilities located at business locations and used primarily for back-up for self-generation (who will be ""public utilities"" subject to the Federal Power Act only while they sell at wholesale) can sell power at wholesale from such facilities to EPMI and EES without prior notice under section 205 of FPA (would usually require 60 day advance notice filing). -- Waives certain parts of the filing requirements for the industrial; however, the industrial will still be subject to shortened filing requirements for dispositions of facilities and interlocking positions while they are selling at wholesale. -- EPMI and EES will make the FERC quarterly filings on behalf of the industrials for any of these purchases. Our report must show the names of the industrial; aggregate amount of capacity and/or energy purchased from each seller; and the aggregate compensation paid to each seller. Accounting/commercial folks for EPMI and EES-- please make sure these purchases are flagged in the accounting system, since the report will be separate from our big quarterly reports. -- This does not authorize the retail industrial customer to violate any rules or tariffs of its host utility.

"TVA and Entergy filed answers to the numerous protests to Entergy's source and sink filing. TVA responded specifically to Enron and VEPCO's filings basically stating that the NERC letter was limited to the TVA/Enron dispute and inapplicable to the Entergy issue. TVA also made accusations that Enron in effect secretly talked with NERC to get a task force made up of members ""predisposed to Enron's point of view."" TVA said that the task force ignored TVA's requests to meet with it and that the task force went beyond current NERC policy. Finally, TVA understands that ""Enron has prevented SERC"" from bringing the matter to NERC ADR. Entergy's answer largely cites past FERC orders that approved the source and sink on tags (and denied Enron's Capacity Reservation Tariff) and basically states that the protests are a collateral attack on Order No. 888 (as we have known, the OATT does require ultimate source and sink on firm and allows them on non-firm). Entergy's filing, however, is lacking in substantive reasons why reliability would be so much better served by requiring this at the reservation level, when NERC has stated it is not necessary for reliability until the 20/30 minute ahead tag. Entergy says it can do a better job of listing actual ATCs and will prevent Entergy from overselling its system (although since Entergy's ATCs are usually low or 0 coming in over the ties, I question how many times Entergy",christi.nicolay@enron.com,"joe.hartsoe@enron.com, richard.shapiro@enron.com, sarah.novosel@enron.com,

If Enron is already in the queue (or considered in a queue) before a TP's interconnection procedures are filed at FERC, we don't want to have to resubmit something within 15 days in order to remain in the queue. I don't think this is necessary and all are protected because pre-existing requests will be posted on OASIS on the queue. 4.3 Enron has argued for 60 days consistent with the OATT times (lost unfortunately). It may look odd for PGE to ask for 90 days. PGE is protected because if it legitimately takes longer than 60 days, you send a notification. 6 ((I realize that this language was included in CP&L, but recommend these changes for PGE.) 6.1 Add after ""as modified by the Commission"" ""if Customer chooses to commence construction."" 6.2 Modify last sentence -- The Agreement will provide milestones toward placing the generator in service that the Interconnection Customer must make reasonable progress toward or it will lose its queue priority (after notification and opportunity to remedy.)

"Attached are filings made this week at FERC to seek permission for EPMI and EES to make certain FERC-required filings (including quarterly power marketer filings) on behalf of industrials with on site generation that sell power into the grid to us. The filings will allow Enron to make it easier for these industrials to sell to us from their administrative filing viewpoint. We expect to receive authorization within 60 days. Generally, industrials with on site generation are required to obtain a FERC power marketer license and comply with FERC's reporting requirements, similar to EPMI and EES' FERC filing requirements. EPMI and EES will be able to file specific industrial purchases in a combined report, rather than requiring the industrials to file their separate reports with FERC. Please contact me if you plan a deal to purchase power from an industrial. We need to consider additional costs/back office transaction flags that may be required in order for us to track these purchases. Thanks.

Enron was working with VEPCO to site an IPP (Enron owned) in VEPCO. We did not come to terms on the PPA this summer. Enron would like to keep its ability to site the plant with the associated queue position. VEPCO basically has ""tied"" our queue position to a PPA with VEPCO and, therefore, kicked Enron out of the queue when we did not execute a PPA. VEPCO recently filed interconnection procedures with FERC that have not been approved yet (these procedures were not in place when we got in the queue--there were only very general ""ask to interconnect"" procedures then). The only place that any ""milestones"" are mentioned is in the Interconnection Agreement (which, of course, VEPCO and Enron never executed).

"(1) As expected, GridSouth and Southern oppose EPMI's request to condition market based rates on RTO participation. GridSouth argues that this is a collateral attack on the ""voluntary"" nature of Order No. 2000. Southern also makes the same argument, but adds that the argument is premature due to Southern's ""significant progress"" in developing an RTO. Southern also attacks our citations to the FERC Staff Investigation stating that the Investigation is based on ""perception,"" not fact, and contains conclusions that are ""ill-formed."" Southern concludes that the ""Southeastern bulk power market worked quite well"" this summer because there were no price spikes. Finally, Southern disputes our request for a settlement judge stating that the Commission should give Southern guidance first. (2) GridSouth responds to the Joint Muni, EPMI, etal. motion to hold the RTO filing in abeyance: Grid South does not oppose additional stakeholder meetings during a 60 day period. It would like the assistance of FERC Dispute Resolution staff and additional guidance from the Commission during that period. GridSouth will provide the Commission a report on the process within 20 days after the conclusion of the this period. (3) Southern requests that the Commission grant its declaratory order request that it can be an RTO States that delays were due to discussions with investment community about spin off of transmission assets.

"FERC has clarified several aspects of interconnection policy in recent orders: EPMI and DENA received a favorable FERC order after protesting numerous aspects of Arizona Public Service's proposed interconnection procedure (IP) and agreement (IA), including a must run provision for generators located in APS-specified load pockets and an unusual liability provision that basically insulated APS from most, if not all, of its actions. FERC held in favor of generators in the following provisions: -- Generators are not required to execute a transmission agreement in order to seek interconnection -- Immaterial changes to the request will not result in loss of queue spot -- Specific milestones must be added -- 60 days (rather than 30) allowed for execution (or FERC filing) of IA -- Generators will not be charged twice for imbalances if serving load -- Required system protection facilities must be identified in the study -- Elimination of the must run requirement (can be negotiated with a generator, subject to APS' filing with justification for proposal) -- Credits must be applied to any transmission service, firm or non-firm -- APS limited to obtaining information from generators that is necessary to satisfy APS reporting obligations, plus APS agrees to inform a generator of information that affects the generator -- APS' liability provision was eliminated in its entirety FERC issued some guidance on how evaluations are performed. In VEPCO, all pending higher-queued requests are included in the evaluation.

"On 11/1/00, FERC Staff issued reports on its Investigation of Bulk Power Markets in the Eastern Interconnection. These reports were the result of a Commission order earlier this summer. Enron's Federal regulatory staff (Christi, Charles Yeung, and Sarah Novosel) provided a great deal of information for this investigation and Joe Hartsoe and Donna Fulton discussed many of the problems with the grid with the new head of Staff, Scott Miller (who recently joined FERC from PG&E Gen). While the Commission is under no obligation to take any of Staff's recommendations, the Commission typically looks to Staff for guidance on transmission and market issues. Importantly, Staff concludes that the Commission should consider these options for the Southeast and Midwest -- all of which Enron has been asking FERC to implement for several years: Reduce the advantages of network service over point to point service by requiring that native load be served under the same tariff as other transmission services to eliminate the current incentives that VIUs have to favor their native load through the calculation of ATC and handling of interconnection requests. While the Staff Hotline is used productively, the Commission can direct Staff to conduct formal investigations into entities that have a pattern of complaints. The Commission could require TPs to submit tariff provisions containing a pro forma interconnection process specific to interconnection, rather than simply relying on the Tennessee Power order that utilizes the OATT timelines and procedures. Require TPs to retain real-time transmission data on market functions pertaining to daily load, internal generation to meet that load",christi.nicolay@enron.com,"richard.shapiro@enron.com, sarah.novosel@enron.com, joe.hartsoe@enron.com,

"(1) As expected, GridSouth and Southern oppose EPMI's request to condition market based rates on RTO participation. GridSouth argues that this is a collateral attack on the ""voluntary"" nature of Order No. 2000. Southern also makes the same argument, but adds that the argument is premature due to Southern's ""significant progress"" in developing an RTO. Southern also attacks our citations to the FERC Staff Investigation stating that the Investigation is based on ""perception,"" not fact, and contains conclusions that are ""ill-formed."" Southern concludes that the ""Southeastern bulk power market worked quite well"" this summer because there were no price spikes. Finally, Southern disputes our request for a settlement judge stating that the Commission should give Southern guidance first. (2) GridSouth responds to the Joint Muni, EPMI, etal. motion to hold the RTO filing in abeyance: Grid South does not oppose additional stakeholder meetings during a 60 day period. It would like the assistance of FERC Dispute Resolution staff and additional guidance from the Commission during that period. GridSouth will provide the Commission a report on the process within 20 days after the conclusion of the this period. (3) Southern requests that the Commission grant its declaratory order request that it can be an RTO States that delays were due to discussions with investment community about spin off of transmission assets.

"On March 14, 01, FERC issued an ""Order removing obstacles to increased electric generation and gas supply in the West.."" (Docket No. EL01-47). Most significantly, FERC authorizes industrials in WSCC to sell power to licensed power marketers (like EPMI and EES) effective 3/14/01 through 12/31/01. The industrial does not have to obtain its own power marketer license from FERC (subject to EPMI and EES making filings for the industrials). (This is similar to the authorization that EPMI and EES requested nationwide earlier this year -- we should hear from FERC on that request by mid-May.) In addition, FERC authorizes DSM sales at wholesale at market based rates. Specifics: Owners of generating facilities located at business locations in the WSCC and used primarily for back-up for self-generation (who will be ""public utilities"" subject to the Federal Power Act only while they sell at wholesale) can sell power at wholesale from such facilities to non-affiliated entities (like EPMI or EES) without prior notice under section 205 of FPA (would usually require 60 day advance notice filing). -- Waives certain parts of the filing requirements for the industrial; however, the industrial will still be subject to shortened filing requirements for dispositions of facilities and interlocking positions while they are selling at wholesale. -- EPMI and EES will make the FERC quarterly filings on behalf of the industrials for any of these purchases.

"I just spoke with Steve Doss and explained how to get a power marketer certificate at FERC (and EWG filing if necessary depending on who West Linn's partner is for plant ownership) and the 60 day (generally) time required (Although I think that FERC would be inclined to wave the 60 days based on the supply shortage in the West). I also explained that EPMI is making a filing this week at FERC that would allow EPMI to provide some FERC filing services on behalf of industrial customers in order to facilitate their sales to the grid (when approved, hopefully in about 60 days). He said that West Linn has not built the 2 cogens yet (43 MWs each of which West Linn would use appr. 17 MWs/hour), but that it is interested in setting up its licenses before the start of retail access on 10/1/01 in Oregon. (An item to think about--I don't know anything about the Oregon retail program or current rate structure with PGE, but generally the lack of retail open access will not prevent an industrial on site generator from selling to the grid, unless its host utility rate schedule precludes it from doing so). I am sending him a FERC order issued last year dealing with industrials selling to the grid (InPower order), plus will send him the EPMI filing when we make it later this week.

"NOTE TO STEVE, RICK, JOE AND JIM -- ENRON CONTINUES TO HAVE ISSUES WITH INTERCONNECTION. THE FERC STAFF INVESTIGATION ALSO SAID THAT INTERCONNECTION POLICY (OR LACK THEREOF) CAN BE USED IN A DISCRIMINATORY MANNER. DO NOT NAME VEPCO, BUT THIS IS A VERY RECENT EXAMPLE THAT YOU MAY WANT TO DISCUSS AT LUNCH. The developers are working to fix this with VEPCO commercial people, so I have not been asked to call FERC yet. --------- I discussed this with developer, Reagan Rorschach today. Enron was working with VEPCO to site an IPP (Enron owned) in VEPCO. We did not come to terms on the PPA this summer. Enron would like to keep its ability to site the plant with the associated queue position. VEPCO basically has ""tied"" our queue position to a PPA with VEPCO and, therefore, kicked Enron out of the queue when we did not execute a PPA. VEPCO recently filed interconnection procedures with FERC that have not been approved yet (these procedures were not in place when we got in the queue--there were only very general ""ask to interconnect"" procedures then). The only place that any ""milestones"" are mentioned is in the Interconnection Agreement (which, of course, VEPCO and Enron never executed).

Both Duquesne and GPU have divested their generation assets, and both have already suffered problems with their POLR service. The implicit reason for the GPU-First Energy merger is that GPU has lost hundreds of millions over the last two years (and promises to do so indefinitely without help) providing POLR service. First Energy can offer both hedging help, but generation in off-peak times (only off-peak because of system congestion in PJM). Enron has an opportunity here to do some good things. However, from a credit perspective, we should be aware that GPU is in a risky position. Duquesne divested of their generation selling their assets to Orion/Constellation. In turn, Duquesne contracted with Orion to provide energy to meet their load. As part of this contract, Duquesne did two things that are questionable from a business perspective. When turning over their assets to Orion, they also transferred the FTRs to Orion. Thus, Duquesne's load no longer holds the FTRs making it difficult to hedge transmission risk. Second, Duquesne did not contract for capacity. For this reason, they are having problems joing an RTO because they have no capacity resources, and Orion is holding them hostage over this",christi.nicolay@enron.com,"william.bradford@enron.com, joe.gordon@enron.com, elizabeth.sager@enron.com,

"Great job on MISO Mike! From: Mike Roan/ENRON@enronXgate on 07/03/2001 09:50 AM To: Christi L Nicolay/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: Subject: RTO Update Christi, my 2 weekly RTO/ISO update is attached. MISO Enron had a big win in MISO during June. The MISO CMWG (Congestion Management Working Group) met during June to discuss and agree on a set of principles that will guide day 2 CM deliberation. In summary the principles mirror Enron's market design framework (the draft principles are attached). The key changes from MISO's model of last November are (and the key changes that will benefit Enron): - Full LMP model to assist real time dispatch (across all control areas). There is ongoing discussion about delegation of MISO responsibilities to control area operators. - No balancing requirement in the day ahead market. Participants will have choice about whether they balance generation and load commitments ahead of time or use the 'spot' or balancing market. - Forward instruments based on actual dispatch patterns rather than forecast patterns minimising uplift charges. There is ongoing discussion on the type of instrument (ie FGR/FTR or some combination). I continue to work with a small group of likeminded parties to ensure that these principles are realised in market design (the group appears to have a majority vote on the CMWG). The real remaining risk is that transmission owners will veto and decisions made within the CMWG. To minimise this risk I am beginning meetings with",christi.nicolay@enron.com,mike.roan@enron.com,"'Mike Roan' : 'person', 'Christi L Nicolay' : 'person'",2,Good job Mike,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,sent,christi.nicolay@enron.com

Gas Turbines Help Meet New Power Peaks for TVA By DAVE FLESSNER Business Editor The Tennessee Valley Authority hasn't started building any new coal or nuclear power plants in more than 25 years. But the federal utility is still adding to its power to meet the growing demand for electricity. In each of the next three years, TVA is adding eight gas-fired turbines to help meet ever-higher electricity peaks in the summer months. The new units won't run most of the time, unlike the base-load plants erected during the first half-century of TVA's history. But TVA is still spending more than $700 million for all of the new plants and contracting to spend more money ",christi.nicolay@enron.com,"joe.hartsoe@enron.com, cynthia.sandherr@enron.com, steven.kean@enron.com,

I would like to send these to Kim Bruno at FERC later today. An additional FYI.

She is to meet with Dave Forster and Mark Taylor on Friday, July 13th at 9am. John Shelk from our DC office told me when people on the Hill say ""Enron OnLine"" they mean not only the online trading platform itself, but the broader subject of financial products and energy trading, whether online or otherwise.

"On 11/1/00, FERC Staff issued reports on its Investigation of Bulk Power Markets in the Eastern Interconnection. These reports were the result of a Commission order earlier this summer. Enron's Federal regulatory staff (Christi, Charles Yeung, and Sarah Novosel) provided a great deal of information for this investigation and Joe Hartsoe and Donna Fulton discussed many of the problems with the grid with the new head of Staff, Scott Miller (who recently joined FERC from PG&E Gen). While the Commission is under no obligation to take any of Staff's recommendations, the Commission typically looks to Staff for guidance on transmission and market issues. Importantly, Staff concludes that the Commission should consider these options for the Southeast and Midwest -- all of which Enron has been asking FERC to implement for several years: Reduce the advantages of network service over point to point service by requiring that native load be served under the same tariff as other transmission services to eliminate the current incentives that VIUs have to favor their native load through the calculation of ATC and handling of interconnection requests. While the Staff Hotline is used productively, the Commission can direct Staff to conduct formal investigations into entities that have a pattern of complaints. The Commission could require TPs to submit tariff provisions containing a pro forma interconnection process specific to interconnection, rather than simply relying on the Tennessee Power order that utilizes the OATT timelines and procedures. Require TPs to retain real-time transmission data on market functions pertaining to daily load, internal generation to meet that load",christi.nicolay@enron.com,"richard.shapiro@enron.com, sarah.novosel@enron.com, joe.hartsoe@enron.com,

I am available for your federal/FERC regulatory questions and can point you to the correct state/regional regulatory people. When initially deciding where to site a plant, there are several federal regulatory issues to consider: First, you will need to obtain the utility's interconnection policy and a pro forma interconnection agreement from the utility. For most utilities, you will need to call them to obtain their policy and agreement. Some utilities have this available on their OASIS computer site or web page. The OASIS sites have areas that do not require a password, but if the information is not available in that area, you should contact the power trading desk transmission personnel to assist in locating the information.

"FERC has clarified several aspects of interconnection policy in recent orders: EPMI and DENA received a favorable FERC order after protesting numerous aspects of Arizona Public Service's proposed interconnection procedure (IP) and agreement (IA), including a must run provision for generators located in APS-specified load pockets and an unusual liability provision that basically insulated APS from most, if not all, of its actions. FERC held in favor of generators in the following provisions: -- Generators are not required to execute a transmission agreement in order to seek interconnection -- Immaterial changes to the request will not result in loss of queue spot -- Specific milestones must be added -- 60 days (rather than 30) allowed for execution (or FERC filing) of IA -- Generators will not be charged twice for imbalances if serving load -- Required system protection facilities must be identified in the study -- Elimination of the must run requirement (can be negotiated with a generator, subject to APS' filing with justification for proposal) -- Credits must be applied to any transmission service, firm or non-firm -- APS limited to obtaining information from generators that is necessary to satisfy APS reporting obligations, plus APS agrees to inform a generator of information that affects the generator -- APS' liability provision was eliminated in its entirety FERC issued some guidance on how evaluations are performed.

"I think I know what you're talking about. I know you weren't asking for a response but I can give a few quick observations based on my well highlighted Order No. 888 and 888-A (without any review or knowledge of subsequent cases). In Order No. 888, FERC allowed stranded costs to be directly assigned to the departing customer either through a transmission surcharge or an exit fee. Par. 31,036 at 31,797. So in general, customers can't avoid paying for stranded costs simply by bypassing. FERC allowed utilities to file for recovery of stranded costs for requirements contracts executed on or before July 11, 1994, if they did not contain explicit stranded cost provisions or provisions prohibiting stranded cost recovery. Id. at 31,810. There appears to be a loophole that, if applicable, would allow bypass. For contracts that don't contain an explicit stranded cost provision and that allow the customer to terminate service upon notice, if the customer gives notice that it would no longer purchase its requirements from the incumbent utility, the FERC does not allow the utility to amend the contract to add a stranded cost provision. However, in that case, the utility could seek to recover stranded costs through its rates for transmission services to the customer provided it could rebut the presumption that it had no reasonable expectation of continuing to serve. Id. at note 679. Accordingly, the customer could avoid the stranded costs if it could bypass transmission service.

"Just to clarify. The product that is traded in New York is a financial swap that settles against the Day Ahead clearing price. It is changes to HQ's physical deliveries (0 to 1500 MW) into NY that can swing the clearing price by at least $20. This is not just due to the price that HQ sells their energy for, but is mostly due to the impact on congestion in NY of HQ deliveries. When HQ is not delivering high volumes, NY is generally uncongested and the price for the entire state is set by gas generation in the East. When HQ delivers high volumes, the system becomes congested and the west price is set by much lower cost resources and the east price is set by gas generation. The impact on the NY West price (Zone A) is at least $15 dollars. Since the majority of the OTC trades are settled against this price, it gives HQ tremendous ability to trade financially and then influence the settlement price. Large generators in New York west could also do this but it would be quite costly for them to withhold 1000 MW of generation and this would be easily noticed. HQ however, has hydro generation and can easily store their water for delivery another day. HQ trades directly in the New York OTC market as HQ Energy Services (US) Inc.. The general market realizes the impact that HQ can have on the clearing price and will often pull out of the market when HQ is trading.

If Enron is already in the queue (or considered in a queue) before a TP's interconnection procedures are filed at FERC, we don't want to have to resubmit something within 15 days in order to remain in the queue. I don't think this is necessary and all are protected because pre-existing requests will be posted on OASIS on the queue. 4.3 Enron has argued for 60 days consistent with the OATT times (lost unfortunately). It may look odd for PGE to ask for 90 days. PGE is protected because if it legitimately takes longer than 60 days, you send a notification. 6 ((I realize that this language was included in CP&L, but recommend these changes for PGE.) 6.1 Add after ""as modified by the Commission"" ""if Customer chooses to commence construction."" 6.2 Modify last sentence -- The Agreement will provide milestones toward placing the generator in service that the Interconnection Customer must make reasonable progress toward or it will lose its queue priority (after notification and opportunity to remedy.)

Judge Edgar has been assigned the matter. *The lawsuit concerns the interpretation of an option contract EPMI and TVA entered into on December 6, 1995 (Master Option Purchase Agreement (MOPA). *The sole issue presented by the declaratory judgement is the obligations of TVA and EPMI under the MOPA in the circumstances where EPMI is unable to schedule for delivery, or deliver, energy requested by TVA under the MOPA at the Scheduled Delivery Point (SDP) if the available transfer capability at the SDP is not sufficient to allow the schedule or delivery. EPMI believes that the MOPA unambiguously addresses the issue. *A trial date in late June 2000 has been set. *EPMI filed a Motion for Summary Judgement on November 18, 1999.",elizabeth.sager@enron.com,christi.nicolay@enron.com,"'Christi' : 'person', 'Judge Edgar' : 'person'",2,Re: TVA Action,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,received,christi.nicolay@enron.com

I don't think this is necessary and all are protected because pre-existing requests will be posted on OASIS on the queue. 4.3 Enron has argued for 60 days consistent with the OATT times (lost unfortunately).

PGE is protected because if it legitimately takes longer than 60 days, you send a notification. 6 ((I realize that this language was included in CP&L, but recommend these changes for PGE.) 6.1 Add after ""as modified by the Commission"" ""if Customer chooses to commence construction."" 6.2 Modify last sentence -- The Agreement will provide milestones toward placing the generator in service that the Interconnection Customer must make reasonable progress toward or it will lose its queue priority (after notification and opportunity to remedy.)

"Just to clarify. The product that is traded in New York is a financial swap that settles against the Day Ahead clearing price. It is changes to HQ's physical deliveries (0 to 1500 MW) into NY that can swing the clearing price by at least $20. This is not just due to the price that HQ sells their energy for, but is mostly due to the impact on congestion in NY of HQ deliveries. When HQ is not delivering high volumes, NY is generally uncongested and the price for the entire state is set by gas generation in the East. When HQ delivers high volumes, the system becomes congested and the west price is set by much lower cost resources and the east price is set by gas generation. The impact on the NY West price (Zone A) is at least $15 dollars. Since the majority of the OTC trades are settled against this price, it gives HQ tremendous ability to trade financially and then influence the settlement price. Large generators in New York west could also do this but it would be quite costly for them to withhold 1000 MW of generation and this would be easily noticed. HQ however, has hydro generation and can easily store their water for delivery another day. HQ trades directly in the New York OTC market as HQ Energy Services (US) Inc.. The general market realizes the impact that HQ can have on the clearing price and will often pull out of the market when HQ is trading. I have heard from a couple of sources that HQ is using Select to trade for them to avoid this problem but I can",tom.may@enron.com,christi.nicolay@enron.com,,0,Re: HQ Energy Mkt.

"Christi, As I have been thinking about this problem, my opposition to a standard model is declining, partly out of frustration with the slow progress being made. I think, however, that we ought to think about the potential consequences of recommending a standard model. If we simply endorse PJM, then we may inadvertently get its warts as well -- no secondary transmission market, ICAP market, etc. I think we are considering the same thing approach as was reported by Charles Yeung's in his note on Tuesday's Inter-RTO Coordination (Seams) Conference: ""Harvey Reed, Constellation Power, suggested that FERC impose a standard tariff for all RTOs to work from that did not restrict RTOs from filing different proposals, but would limit their ability to diverge from a single market model."" In addition to the standard model, there needs to be a deadline for either filing the tariff or for filing the standard tariff. Without a ""feet to the fire"" feature, nothing the grand stall will continue. In arguing for a standard model, the PJM system could be the core of a proposal but we should specific modifications to address our concerns. On the transmission rights issue, for instance, a simple ""don't allocate"" solution won't work. The lack of the secondary market for NY TCCs or PJM FTRs goes both to the lack of information and to the way the rights are defined. If as Harvey Reed suggests, RTOs can submit alternative approaches, at least there will be pressure to get moving.",steve.walton@enron.com,christi.nicolay@enron.com,"'Christi' : 'person', 'Charles Yeung' : 'person', 'Harvey Reed' : 'person', 'Harvey Reed' : 'person'",4,Re: INTERIM MODEL TALKING POINTS,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,received,christi.nicolay@enron.com
