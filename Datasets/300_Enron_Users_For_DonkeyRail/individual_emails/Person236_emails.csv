"Ben, The unit deliveries that go with revised milestone 10 are units # 21&22 that actually occur by March 30, 2001. I've already pushed back payments as far as I can for Units 19,20, 23, & 24, by splitting the 10% into two 5% payments from the earlier agreed to 2/15 date. So the deferral of 5% of contract to 7/30/01 more than accomodates the later ship dates. The value for delaying ~ $ 17.5 mm for 75 days is already benefitting by $ 365,000 assuming 10% cost of money. That's the best we can do. Sorry if I didn't make myself clear. Please call if we need to discuss further before concluding the Change Order.

"Peter/Kay, Attached is revised ESA Facility Agreement. This includes the Optional Electric Output Guarantee for the Brazil site conditions. Since the spread between the 8 unit average guarantee and the single unit is greater than in the base contract the LD sample calc needed some work, which I took care of. Kay/Kent, I also took a swipe at the 17.4 Termination language rework. See if I what I came up with works...if so, we can use on all other Facility Agreements. I've added John Ayres to distribution. John and I will be reviewing the contract Monday AM at 8:30 in his office. Kay, it would be good if you could join us ...as we're in the home stretch.

One, this amendment only covers 4 Standard Base Exhaust Stacks, so to reference the dwgs for the Heavy Base Exhaust Stacks and Extensions isn't necessary and could be confusing to somebody ""down the road"". The other adds the October 31, 2000 delivery date for the stacks. How's the other Amendment related to Brazil?

"Ben, The unit deliveries that go with revised milestone 10 are units # 21&22 that actually occur by March 30, 2001. I've already pushed back payments as far as I can for Units 19,20, 23, & 24, by splitting the 10% into two 5% payments from the earlier agreed to 2/15 date. So the deferral of 5% of contract to 7/30/01 more than accomodates the later ship dates. The value for delaying ~ $ 17.5 mm for 75 days is already benefitting by $ 365,000 assuming 10% cost of money.

"Rebecca, John Ayres and I met today. He wishes to add the interconnect piping between the chiller and cooling tower options in Exhibit N-2 for the ESA Electrobolt Project. This adds a total of $ 266,400 to the Jan 15, 2001 payment (equal to $ 33,280 per unit). There will be no effect on the 12/27/00 payment amount. I've edited your spread sheet to show this. John Ayres asked if he could have a stripped down version of the Spread sheet showing only the ESA amounts. Kay, You'll notice that the Cooling Tower Option is Exhibit N-2 was changed to add this interconnect piping to the scope. I hope this helps.

"Sounds good. We went to Palacios last weekend. The water was very silty from the rain, and the tide was low. There were a few black drum, but not much else.

"Lee, The best way to go about it would be to send the invoice to Jody, but copy the Enron project folks you have been dealing with. Are we ready to sign the Fountain Valley contract? I would think that we could sign the change order at the same time, and payment terms can be whatever the Enron project team has bought in to. The banks won't care. Have you seen sig pages for ESA yet?

Also, we've still got a change order needed for Fountain Valley for the 6 Power System Stabilizers and 2 Exhaust Stacks. LV is also saying they will need 4 Power System Stabilizers, but haven't confirmed their order.
