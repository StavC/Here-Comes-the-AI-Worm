The Market Rules were still being discussed and had not been approved by ANEEL, making it impossible for us to implement EOL, from a regulatory standpoint. Recently (about a couple of weeks ago), ANEEL issued Resolution 290/00, approving the Market Rules, subject to certain amendments. The amendments will be implemented in stages over the course of the next few years. After Resolution 290 was issued and the regulatory issues were partially resolved, the EOL team decided to work on the project again. I am now in the course of adapting the ETA, GTC and Password Application for use in Brazil. I will probably have drafts for comments within the next 10 days.

Marc, We have sought, and paid for, advice from Indian counsel concerning commodity derivative transactions with Indian counterparites.

The result of that advice is that we will require an opinion from DPC's outside counsel that the proposed transaction is enforceable against DPC before the transaction can proceed.

"Sorry about the delay. Here are my responses: 1. Yes, this is primarily a tax issue. However, there are some countries with strange laws regarding internet usage and we have covered some of those issues with specific PA provisions for those countries. 2. No. Only one user from each counterparty has to accept the GTC and that only the first time they trade that product. The GTC's are arranged by ""Product Type"" so you only have to agree to it once for that type - regardless of how many products there are - so for example you only agree to the financial derivatives GTC once no matter how many different types of swaps and options you subsequently trade. 3. No. But if that would be helpful it can be arranged. 4. This one doesn't make much sense to me. EnronOnline itself doesn't make any money. There is no advertizing, and EnronOnline doesn't trade - the trades are all done by the various Enron trading entities. EnronOnline is actually providing them a service. 5. I really have no idea. I guess we would have to print out the records and have one of the IT people testify that they had not been modified. 6. So far we haven't deleted anything. If we need to keep the records for a long time we probably can but this has not been discussed.

Chuck Grassley introduced legislation last night to overhaul the nation's bankruptcy system. The bill he introduced - S.220 - is identical to the final conference report approved last year by the Senate and House of Representatives but pocket-vetoed by President Clinton. Grassley said that he looks forward to Senate action on the measure which had veto-proof support last year. Senators voted 70-28 for the final package, and the House gave the conference report unanimous approval in December. Rep. George Gekas is expected to reintroduce the legislation in the House. The Senate Majority Leader has indicated that the bankruptcy reform bill could be ready for consideration by the Senate as early as next week. Grassley said the proposal which he sponsored last year with Sen. Robert Torricelli of New Jersey ""is unfinished business that has strong bipartisan support in Congress and at the grassroots."" The reform measure is aimed at reducing the number of bankruptcies filed each year by fixing weaknesses in the code and designing a more balanced, fair approach",mark.taylor@enron.com,carol.clair@enron.com,"'Mark Taylor' : 'person', 'Stacy Carey' : 'person', 'Sen.

"Mark, you may recall my memo to you in April, 1999 which indicated that for netting purposes, the conditions included: 1. The transaction must be governed by a market standard master agreement or occur on a French regulated market 2. One of the parties must be (a) an ""investment firm"" within the meaning of the law of 2nd of July, 1996, (b) an instituion or firm benefitting from the provisions of article 25 of the Law or (c) a non-resident entity having a ""comparable status"" The term ""investment firm"" embodies financial type institutions which recieve and transmit order for financial instruments for third parties. There are 12 categories of article 25 firms (including Bank of France, insurance companies, broker types, etc.) .For example, one murky designation includes ""persons who supply an investment service which is ancillary to their professional activity, provided the rules governing such activity do not prohibt the carrying on of investment services"". Slaughter and May has advised that they could assist us in determining whether our French counterparty fit this category and it definitely needs to be discussed with the counterparty (and extract a rep from them as well). There are other categories as well. I have a copy of the law if you would like to review. The non-resident entity having ""comparable status"" is the category WE were trying for fit into without much success. Tana tells me that I have given you misinformation.

"Dear Mark Taylor, Please review the language below; it is a first attempt at making a non binding proposal to Noble Drilling. Please return your approved language asap. Thanks John A. Peyton Dear Mark Mey, We appreciate your interest in our new dayrate financial products. For your consideration, we would like to indicatively propose a transaction in which Enron North America would purchase a Financial Call Option (""Cap"") from Noble Drilling Corporation for the Calculation Period April 1, 2001 through June 30, 2001 for one Rig. The Strike Price would be $65,000 per (Rig*Day) and the premium which we would pay to Noble Drilling Corporation (within Five Business Days of the Trade Date) would be US Dollars $200,000. The Commodity Reference Price would be the arithmetic mean of the high and low Rig Day Rates for JU-300'-IC as published by Offshore Data Services, Inc., or its successor, in the last issue of Gulf of Mexico Weekly Rig Locator, or any successor publication, published during the applicable Calculation Period, on the page entitled ""Gulf of Mexico Rig Utilization and Day Rates"". The Payment Date(s) would be the fifth (5th) Business Day following the date on which the Floating Price is determinable. We have authority to enter into the above transaction and would be able to move quickly toward providing you with an executable contract. Because the market for dayrates is highly volatile and because we may have made similar proposals to other counterparties, this indicative proposal is only good until August 31st, 2000.

"Mark, In the context of our aim to introduce (physically-settled) base metals via EOL, I have reviewed MG's existing customer base. There are a small number of counterparties from jurisdictions that have not been reviewed from here and I'd be grateful if you could let me know whether these have been reviewed by you , and also whether any of these jurisdictions are ""restricted"" from a US perspective.

"Another ""unusual"" thought (subject to usual MG concerns): Could we move the NYMEX trades out of ENA's name and have the MG entity ""own"" the trades for itself as a clearing member thereby allowing MG to post 50% LCs on its own trades? MG would not be acting as our clearing broker but for their own account. Of course, we would have to verify that this would work and consider regulatory oversight issues.

It seems to me that we both need to finalize the structure as well as co-ordinate across various groups such that we all know what each is doing with the view to funding on time by the end of next week. 1. As soon as possible next week (i.e. Monday) we need to finalize the swap structure including the credit and covenant package. 2. If there is not already a Term Sheet in place, it may be useful to have one prepared. Frankly, it seems from my various discussions with Global Finance, Credit, Origination, Enron Corp., Royal Bank of Canada and its external counsel and our external counsel, that there are certain agreements, documents, deliverables and covenants that are being expected by, or exchanged between, the parties, but which are not being communicated among each other and we are therefore working at cross purposes.

"Mark, One of the current priorities of Casino Willamette is our Services Desk, a relatively new concept whereby we supposedly do a bunch of California scheduling coordination services for customers who are too unsophisticated to deal with California complexity, earn a reasonable little fee and, here is the kicker, the whole enterprise is seen as involving ""very little risk."" It is seen as picking up a fair bit of change off the floor with no risk, as though a slot machine broke and a bunch of quarters rolled around on the floor and all we have to do is scrape them up. Not big money, but safe money. ""Pays the overhead,"" one often hears traders remark. I have drafted a series of confirms over last year to document a variety of transactions and am in the process of reviewing them with an eye to constant improvement. I am having a series of discussions with traders, schedulers and settlement folks and one risk that keeps coming up in their minds, which I am not really sure I have covered in our documents is referred to as ""system outage risk."" Interaction with the Cal PX and the California ISO is all online electronic. Scheduling power into the California market is all an online business. So let us say that one bright spring morning we have agreed with our 17 SC customers to schedule a variety of power products into and out of the California system, and right at the critical moment when all of this scheduling stuff is supposed to click, the whole damn system collapses?
