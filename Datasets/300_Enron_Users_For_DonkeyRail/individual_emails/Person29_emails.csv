"Please be advised of a serious problem with Terminal Server! We were all kicked out of Terminal Server consistently on Sunday. At first it happened about every half hour (9am to 10:30a.m). Then it happened every 5 minutes. Communication seemed slow. We paged and called the Portland IT Team at 11:30 (Diana & Chip). At 12noon Diana said Chip and Paul Kane were working on it. At around 12:30 Paul Kane called back and said ""Vince"" in Houston was working on it. We asked for Vince's Phone number and Paul stated that Vince would call us instead. Vince called at about 1:00 and said everything was now working. Five minutes later we were still getting kicked out. We then paged and called Chip and he said he was trying to get ahold of Houston. At 1:30 we called the Resolution Center. They indicated they had no clue we were having problems. At 1: 45 we called Greg Marsalis in Houston and he said he was unaware of who was working on it, but was going to look into it. Greg did look into it and said they were still not able to pinpoint the problem. At this writing,(3:10p.m.) we are still not able to use Terminal Server and consequently are unable to transact with the ISO or to enter deals in enpower. This has also affected our connection to PX Trade App. We are effectively prevented from taking advantage of market conditions in California. Earlier I had started to initiate some congestion relief on the Palo Verde tie . Cong was $225 to $250 at Palo and I was confident I could take advantage by moving power",phillip.platter@enron.com,"jeff.richter@enron.com, tim.belden@enron.com, john.forney@enron.com,

The only problem is once we enter deals in enpower at detailed points, The enpower to caps report does not balance.

"Dennis, I'm attempting to understand how the UC-Davis deal, if done, will impact us . How is this different than all of the other retail contracts that you service? One concern that I had was if they opted to go for direct access and still had provisions to change their load on short notice(real time) this would cause some big problems for our real time group. To my knowledge, we don't currently have any contracts like this. Is this the reason UC-Davis wasn't included in the original deal with the UC System? Can you give me a call or an e-mail?

"Please be advised of a serious problem with Terminal Server! We were all kicked out of Terminal Server consistently on Sunday. At first it happened about every half hour (9am to 10:30a.m). Then it happened every 5 minutes. Communication seemed slow. We paged and called the Portland IT Team at 11:30 (Diana & Chip). At 12noon Diana said Chip and Paul Kane were working on it. At around 12:30 Paul Kane called back and said ""Vince"" in Houston was working on it. We asked for Vince's Phone number and Paul stated that Vince would call us instead. Vince called at about 1:00 and said everything was now working. Five minutes later we were still getting kicked out. We then paged and called Chip and he said he was trying to get ahold of Houston. At 1:30 we called the Resolution Center. They indicated they had no clue we were having problems. At 1: 45 we called Greg Marsalis in Houston and he said he was unaware of who was working on it, but was going to look into it. Greg did look into it and said they were still not able to pinpoint the problem. At this writing,(3:10p.m.) we are still not able to use Terminal Server and consequently are unable to transact with the ISO or to enter deals in enpower. This has also affected our connection to PX Trade App. We are effectively prevented from taking advantage of market conditions in California. Earlier I had started to initiate some congestion relief on the Palo Verde tie . Cong was $225 to $250 at Palo and I was confident I could take advantage by moving power",phillip.platter@enron.com,"jeff.richter@enron.com, tim.belden@enron.com, john.forney@enron.com,

I would suggest you contact our Human Resources area and complete an application so a current one will be on file.

"-----Original Message----- From: Platter [mailto:platter.oregon@verizon.net] Sent: Thursday, December 13, 2001 8:42 PM To: lkapustka@oppd.com Subject: Resume' - Phillip Platter - Enron Power Marketing Dear Ms. Kapustka, Last year I believe you had a conversation with my sister Molly Elvig about any opportunities for me at OPPD. I got in touch with Dave Dietz ( it may have been Dave Ried) at that time and it was apparent then that there weren't opportunities available. Since then, I have expanded on my experience in the power industry with Enron in Portland, Oregon. As you may know, Enron has filed for bankruptcy which has resulted in very uncertain times for many Enron employees including myself. While I am still employed in Enron's trading operations and believe we will be back trading as soon as we find a buyer, I have decided to seek other opportunities. I believe my experience at Enron, especially in power trading and scheduling, would provide me with a great foundation for success at OPPD. The past 11 months I have been trading next day power in the California market. My primary responsibilities included making markets on EnronOnline for off peak and odd-lot power. My average daily trading volume for these products ranged from 60 to 90 trades per day. I also had responsibility for managing the scheduling function which had been my main focus for the prior 3 years. Much of my time has been spent analyzing the market fundamentals including plant outages, transmission constraints, gas prices, weather,",platter.oregon@verizon.net,phillip.platter@enron.com,"'lkapustka@oppd.com' : 'email', 'Phillip Platter' : 'person', 'Ms. Kapustka' : 'person', 'Molly Elvig' : 'person', 'Dave Dietz' : 'person', 'Dave Ried' : 'person', 'Portland, Oregon' : 'postal code'",7,FW: Resume' - Phillip Platter - Enron Power Marketing,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,received,phillip.platter@enron.com
"Dear Phil Platter, Thank you for your gift of $100.00 to The September 11th Fund. The Fund was established by United Way of New York City and The New York Community Trust to respond to the immediate and longer-term needs of victims, their families, and communities affected by the tragic events of September 11, 2001. Within 11 days of the attacks, checks were being written to victims and their families by experienced relief agencies using cash grants from The September 11th Fund. Right now, your contribution is helping to provide emergency cash assistance, legal counseling, grief therapy, job training and placement, and other vital services for victims, families and others directly affected. Your gift is helping people and communities rebuild their lives. On behalf of Joshua Gotbaum, chief executive officer of The September 11th Fund, we invite you to visit http://www.september11fund.org for up-to-date information and to sign up for e-mail updates on how your contribution to The September 11th Fund is helping to fund recovery efforts. If your employer has a matching gift program for The September 11th Fund and requires verification of your gift, this e-mail will serve as that verification. Please contact your company's human resource or community affairs department if you have any questions. Again, thank you for your continued support of The September 11th Fund and of community foundations and United Ways across the country.

"-----Original Message----- From: KAPUSTKA, LAURA L [mailto:lkapustka@oppd.com] Sent: Monday, December 17, 2001 5:35 AM To: Platter Subject: RE: Resume' - Phillip Platter - Enron Power Marketing Phillip - Thanks for the e-mail. I spoke with David Reid (Division Manager - Energy Marketing & Trading) regarding open trading positions. He indicated that he has one opening for a energy marketer (shift position) that will be posted internally first. If he doesn't get any qualified applicants, he will look externally. I would suggest you contact our Human Resources area and complete an application so a current one will be on file. I will watch for the position to be posted and let you know when it is opened to current employees - that will give you an idea of the time frame for filling the position. Good luck!
