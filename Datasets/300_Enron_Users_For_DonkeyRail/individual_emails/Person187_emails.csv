"Justin - Further to our conversation yesterday I have reviewed the existing HDD Swap GTC's. In contrast to the Financial GTC's which when read with the ETA are drafted on the basis that the GTC's only apply if an ISDA has not been executed, the HDD Swap GTC's have been drafted to work in unison with the ISDA framework. The HDD Swap GTC together with the specific documentation for each transaction constitutes a Confirmation under the ISDA Form. I have made some drafting changes in this regard the most important of which is the carve out of the language in the ETA which provides that GTC's will only apply if an ISDA has been executed. Incidentally - with respect to the ETA - it seems to provide that the relevant GTC's will apply in respect of a Transaction if an ISDA is not in place on the trade date of such transaction, however it does not seem to make any provision for circumstances where an ISDA/Master Agreement is entered into subsequent to the execution of a Transaction. In such circumstances on a literal interpretation of the ETA, the pre-existing Transaction would continued to be governed by the GTC but future Transactions would be governed by the ISDA/Master Agreement. From a netting perspective this is not ideal. Is this the intention ? Give me a shout when you have had a chance to review the attached.

"As I understand it from a tax and legal perspectibe transactions booked in ENA should be executed by a trader sitting in Houston. As far as I am aware there is no brokerage or agency arrangement with either EFT or EnronCredit.com in this regard and therefore traders sitting in London should not execute these transactions independently of the traders sitting in Houston. From a booking perspective in this type of situation generally a separate trading book should be mainatined by ENA. It may be acceptable for EnronCredit.com to risk manage ENA's credit derivaties postions provided the requisite service agreement has been put in place - this is really a question for ENA - Mark ?. I do not know if such a service agreement is in place. Where a transaction is booked into ENA and not bt-backed with .Com the market risk will reside with ENA - a btb with .Com would be necessary to consolidate the mtm of the ENA credit derivatives business in .Com. In view of the fact that Bryan is viewing all credit derivatives business as a global book, all credit derivatives business entered into by Enron entities other than EnronCredit.com should be back-to-backed with .Com. In situations where ENA has sold protection and .Com has bought protection on the same name this internal structure will permit ENA immediately Delivering on the Portfolio of Deliverable Obligations it as received as the Seller of protection to .Com which can in turn can Deliver on to the counterparty",denis.o'connell@enron.com,bryan.seyfried@enron.com,"'Mark' : 'person', 'Bryan' : 'person'",2,Re: ENA / Enron Credit.com,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,sent,denis.o'connell@enron.com

"Anna, I have reviewed the existing ECTRIC, Norweigan Branch HDD Swap GTC's. In contrast to the Financial GTC's which when read with the ETA are drafted on the basis that the GTC's only apply if an ISDA has not been executed, the HDD Swap GTC's have been drafted to work in unison with the ISDA framework. The HDD Swap GTC together with the specific documentation for each transaction constitutes a Confirmation under the ISDA Master Agreement. As such every counterparty should be required to accept the GTC's regardless of whether or not they have an ISDA Master Agreement in place. If an ISDA Master has been executed this will govern the HDD Swaps as modified by the terms of the relevant GTC's. If no ISDA Master is in place the GTC's will govern. I have made some drafting changes in respect of the existing HDD Swap GTC's which I have forwarded to Mark and Justin for comments. I will revert to you in due course with respect to any changes.

"As I understand it from a tax and legal perspectibe transactions booked in ENA should be executed by a trader sitting in Houston. As far as I am aware there is no brokerage or agency arrangement with either EFT or EnronCredit.com in this regard and therefore traders sitting in London should not execute these transactions independently of the traders sitting in Houston. From a booking perspective in this type of situation generally a separate trading book should be mainatined by ENA. It may be acceptable for EnronCredit.com to risk manage ENA's credit derivaties postions provided the requisite service agreement has been put in place - this is really a question for ENA - Mark ?. I do not know if such a service agreement is in place. Where a transaction is booked into ENA and not bt-backed with .Com the market risk will reside with ENA - a btb with .Com would be necessary to consolidate the mtm of the ENA credit derivatives business in .Com. In view of the fact that Bryan is viewing all credit derivatives business as a global book, all credit derivatives business entered into by Enron entities other than EnronCredit.com should be back-to-backed with .Com. In situations where ENA has sold protection and .Com has bought protection on the same name this internal structure will permit ENA immediately Delivering on the Portfolio of Deliverable Obligations it as received as the Seller of protection to .Com which can in turn can Deliver on to the counterparty",denis.o'connell@enron.com,bryan.seyfried@enron.com,"'Mark' : 'person', 'Bryan' : 'person'",2,Re: ENA / Enron Credit.com,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,sent,denis.o'connell@enron.com

"As I understand it from a tax and legal perspectibe transactions booked in ENA should be executed by a trader sitting in Houston. As far as I am aware there is no brokerage or agency arrangement with either EFT or EnronCredit.com in this regard and therefore traders sitting in London should not execute these transactions independently of the traders sitting in Houston. From a booking perspective in this type of situation generally a separate trading book should be mainatined by ENA. It may be acceptable for EnronCredit.com to risk manage ENA's credit derivaties postions provided the requisite service agreement has been put in place - this is really a question for ENA - Mark ?. I do not know if such a service agreement is in place. Where a transaction is booked into ENA and not bt-backed with .Com the market risk will reside with ENA - a btb with .Com would be necessary to consolidate the mtm of the ENA credit derivatives business in .Com. In view of the fact that Bryan is viewing all credit derivatives business as a global book, all credit derivatives business entered into by Enron entities other than EnronCredit.com should be back-to-backed with .Com. In situations where ENA has sold protection and .Com has bought protection on the same name this internal structure will permit ENA immediately Delivering on the Portfolio of Deliverable Obligations it as received as the Seller of protection to .Com which can in turn can Deliver on to the counterparty",denis.o'connell@enron.com,bryan.seyfried@enron.com,"'Mark' : 'person', 'Bryan' : 'person'",2,Re: ENA / Enron Credit.com,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,sent,denis.o'connell@enron.com

"Justin - Further to our conversation yesterday I have reviewed the existing HDD Swap GTC's. In contrast to the Financial GTC's which when read with the ETA are drafted on the basis that the GTC's only apply if an ISDA has not been executed, the HDD Swap GTC's have been drafted to work in unison with the ISDA framework. The HDD Swap GTC together with the specific documentation for each transaction constitutes a Confirmation under the ISDA Form. I have made some drafting changes in this regard the most important of which is the carve out of the language in the ETA which provides that GTC's will only apply if an ISDA has been executed. Incidentally - with respect to the ETA - it seems to provide that the relevant GTC's will apply in respect of a Transaction if an ISDA is not in place on the trade date of such transaction, however it does not seem to make any provision for circumstances where an ISDA/Master Agreement is entered into subsequent to the execution of a Transaction. In such circumstances on a literal interpretation of the ETA, the pre-existing Transaction would continued to be governed by the GTC but future Transactions would be governed by the ISDA/Master Agreement.

"Denis - Deutsche Bank recently completed an ISDA with ENA. On the heals of this agreement, they are now working on getting access to EOL for financial trading. They originally provided five pages of comments to the ETA and Password Application, but it was clear from the comments they really did not understand how EOL was presented for use. I provided a letter to them better explaining the way EOL works. They have recently provided additional comments to both documents. Tana suggested that you may have worked on an ETA with Deutsche Bank for EnronCredit. Accordingly, before I move forward and respond to/negotiate the changes, I wanted to check with you and see if this was accurate and, if so, whether or not you agreed to changes in the document. If so, could you please give me a heads up as to what areas were modified and were big issues. Let me know at your convenience. Cheers!!

"I agree with Denis' remarks especially about there being a single book and hence the need for matching terms and back-to-back trades.

"Denis - Deutsche Bank recently completed an ISDA with ENA. On the heals of this agreement, they are now working on getting access to EOL for financial trading. They originally provided five pages of comments to the ETA and Password Application, but it was clear from the comments they really did not understand how EOL was presented for use. I provided a letter to them better explaining the way EOL works. They have recently provided additional comments to both documents. Tana suggested that you may have worked on an ETA with Deutsche Bank for EnronCredit. Accordingly, before I move forward and respond to/negotiate the changes, I wanted to check with you and see if this was accurate and, if so, whether or not you agreed to changes in the document.
