The Remaining Purchase Amount Refund Amount allows us to deduct interest, a benefit of ~2.24%. Can GE give us any discount in excess of 2.24%? If so, we should opt for the GE Accelerated Payment.

"I've attached my comments by redlining Change Order #2 to the Blue Dog turbine contract. The main points were 1) to replace EE&CC with ENA as the Agent to E-Next Generation LLC and 2) to have 30 days to pay the invoice. The E-Next Generation payment process is to receive ONE advance each month on the 15th, therefore I could not guarantee payment within 10 days of receipt of invoice. -Catherine x3-9943 -----Original Message----- From: Barto, Brian Sent: Thursday, February 01, 2001 11:44 AM To: Clark, Catherine; Mann, Kay Subject: Catherine: Lisa phoned me and said she would give you a heads up that this second change order needed review and quick turn around.

"You raise a very interesting question on how EECC and ENA will interface in the future. I understand that ENA now has a Technical Support Group (something like that), and some of the folks are EECC personnel who have transferred to ENA. I do not know their function or role. As for the integration of EECC legal comments into a document, I would say that it would depend on the comment. Essentially, the deals are ENA deals, not EECC deals, which means ENA has decision making responsibility. Also, ENA is the project sponsor/owner (until sold), and NEPCO is usually the contractor. The conflicts arise when NEPCO (usually not EECC on ENA deals) is asked to wrap certain contracts, so EECC or NEPCO takes a position as a contractor. So it is difficult for EECC to act as the owner's engineer and the EPC contractor. Another interface issue is that EECC contracts personnel do not typically involve the EECC lawyers in major equipment contracts until the end of the negotiation process. Perhaps this has changed since I left, but that was how things worked when I was with EECC. On the finance/deal lawyer front, my question is who deals with the lenders and their counsel once the financing vehicle is in place? I'll let you know if I think of anything else. I suspect Sheila will have some insight, also.
