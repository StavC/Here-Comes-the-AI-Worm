"Mary, HPLC currently has a gas purchase agreement (global #96014987) in place with Calpine that extends through 5/31/2001. Sitara deal no. 133259 correctly has this contract attached to it. Effective 11/1/1998 the contract was amended releasing Gouger wells no. 5 & 6. These wells were apparently the only producing wells behind this point. Evidence being no measured volumes in MIPS. There are however other non producing wells behind this point. Is your Sept & Oct UA4 issue the direct result of volumes being scheduled at meter no. 4229? If so, for November, the nom at this point will be taken to 1mmbtu/d until the wells behind this point began to produce. As far as meter 6835 (Roos #1 C/P) is concerned, HPLC also has a contract (#96003771) in place with Cokinos Nat Gas that is currently in an ""evergreen"" status. The aforementioned wells were released from the Calpine contract; however, they were not added behind meter 6835.

"Mary, HPLC meter number 0984229 was physically remove from service in December, 1999. Typically, before HPL physically pulls a meter, production has ceased at minimum for 6 months or the production has been released. In the case of the Roos common point, the producing wells were released and attached to meter 0989740 in 11/98 and the remaining wells are non-producing.

Once that is done, I will need to research in the system how those wellheads were allocated and paid and reallocate to your Calpine deal.

"Mary, HPLC meter number 0984229 was physically remove from service in December, 1999.

"Vance: Per our conversation, we have two possible options to resolve this deal, depending on whether the wellheads are producing or not. Producing: If that is the case, the purchase from Calpine, and any contracts hedged to it will need to be backed up in the system to a wellhead level. Once that is done, I will need to research in the system how those wellheads were allocated and paid and reallocate to your Calpine deal. This will probably have to go back to HPLC's ownership of HPLR's gathering assets. Non-producing: Should we determine that the Common Point and any wells behind it have been shut-in, or P&A'd, we will need to reallocate this deal to zero, and unwind any hedges against it (or, move the hedges to another deal, if possible. Since the deal is older, we probably sold lower priced contracts against the production and a buy-back today would possibly result in a financial loss). In either case, the deal needs to be cleaned up back to the date of last flow at meter 4229, which I am currently looking into. I will email you as soon as I ascertain that date. In lieu of the past couple of days, we may need to look at all of the deals which were impacted by HPLC's aquisition of HPLR's gathering to ensure that they are being captured properly, both at a book level and at a state filing level.

"Vance, The issue is that the 4229 meter has been terminated in the system, per Cheryl Jones, effective 2/00. Therefore, any purchases at that point, for 02/00 forward, are UA4 and are probably having a negative impact on your accrual. I think perhaps this deal should be backed up to a wellhead level? There have not been any measured volumes at 4229 since its termination, so, I don't know where exactly the term Calpine deal is, physically. Your assistance in clearing this up is greatly appreciated.

"Vance: Per our conversation, we have two possible options to resolve this deal, depending on whether the wellheads are producing or not. Producing: If that is the case, the purchase from Calpine, and any contracts hedged to it will need to be backed up in the system to a wellhead level. Once that is done, I will need to research in the system how those wellheads were allocated and paid and reallocate to your Calpine deal. This will probably have to go back to HPLC's ownership of HPLR's gathering assets. Non-producing: Should we determine that the Common Point and any wells behind it have been shut-in, or P&A'd, we will need to reallocate this deal to zero, and unwind any hedges against it (or, move the hedges to another deal, if possible. Since the deal is older, we probably sold lower priced contracts against the production and a buy-back today would possibly result in a financial loss). In either case, the deal needs to be cleaned up back to the date of last flow at meter 4229, which I am currently looking into. I will email you as soon as I ascertain that date. In lieu of the past couple of days, we may need to look at all of the deals which were impacted by HPLC's aquisition of HPLR's gathering to ensure that they are being captured properly, both at a book level and at a state filing level. Please let me know what your thoughts are as to how to accomplish this.
