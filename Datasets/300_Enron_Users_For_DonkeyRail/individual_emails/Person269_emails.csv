"Attached is a Client Alert, which discusses amendments to the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 that were signed this week by the President. As you know, the HSR Act imposes a premerger notification obligation for mergers and acquisitions exceeding certain size thresholds. The amendments take effect as of February 1, 2001 and govern transactions that close on or after that date. As anticipated, the amendments increase the size-of-transaction threshold from $15 million to $50 million, and they eliminate the 15% prong of the size-of-transaction threshold. They also eliminate the size-of-person threshold for transactions with a value exceeding $200 million. Congress projects that about half of filings will be eliminated under the new thresholds. The amendments also adopt a three-tier filing fee structure, with filing fees increased for larger transactions. John L.

"Attached is a Client Alert, which discusses amendments to the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 that were signed this week by the President. As you know, the HSR Act imposes a premerger notification obligation for mergers and acquisitions exceeding certain size thresholds. The amendments take effect as of February 1, 2001 and govern transactions that close on or after that date. As anticipated, the amendments increase the size-of-transaction threshold from $15 million to $50 million, and they eliminate the 15% prong of the size-of-transaction threshold. They also eliminate the size-of-person threshold for transactions with a value exceeding $200 million. Congress projects that about half of filings will be eliminated under the new thresholds. The amendments also adopt a three-tier filing fee structure, with filing fees increased for larger transactions. John L.

I propose going back to George with the proposal that simultaneously with the execution of the unanimous consent that ENA be permitted to exercise its puts under the two LLC, which can be done with InterGen's consent and InterGen's receipt of an acknowledgment from GE that the exercise of the put will not in any manner prejudice the rights under the Facility Agreements (which in view of the transfer of the turbines and the Facility Agreements being permitted by GE, such a request may be superfluous, but I'd like to have it anyway). I considered also recommending a release from ENA's obligations under the Letter Agreements, but I think that may be pushing too far. Let me know your thoughts.
