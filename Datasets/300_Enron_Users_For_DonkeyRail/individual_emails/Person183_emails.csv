"Dear Frank, Many thanks for helping out on this. Should be pretty straight forward I think because it is not a ""new"" product so much as a slightly revised version of an existing product (US WTI). There has also been a development which makes it even simpler. At first the product was going to be WTI (which is usually in USD and barrels) in JPY and kiloliters but apparently EOL have said kiloliters wont actually work so the only twist is that this product will be in yen and not USD. I have therefore amended the documents I sent yesterday (so I hope you haven't looked at them yet ...) to take the barrel / KL conversion language out (and to remove the glitch from the Business Day definition in the GTCs). Accordingly, this email is exhaustive and you can ignore the one I sent yesterday (which was at the bottom of Alan's email to me). I am attaching a number of documents. (i) The first is an internal memo re two new products Enron Japan wants to put on EOL. The Enron CP will be ENA which is why I need your help before going to Mark. The memo describes the product generally and how it will work (and sets out the background as to why EJ is pushing this initiative). This is FYI only. (ii) & (iii) These are the (ii) draft product descriptions and (iii) GTCs and we need ENA legal sign off re same. If you are happy with these then I will pass to Mark Taylor for final approval (assuming",jane.mcbride@enron.com,frank.sayre@enron.com,"'Frank' : 'person', 'email' : 'email', 'Alan's email' : 'email', 'Mark Taylor' : 'person'",4,RE: EOL - New Product - JPY denominated WTI Swap,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,received,frank.sayre@enron.com

In general, we need to make clear that we are replacing the credit support provider under the ISDA. Otherwise, I am concerned that we could face a possible default under the ISDA once the VRI parental guaranty is terminated. Otherwise, the letter looks very agreeable to me. I am anticipating we can get this executed today so please keep in touch with me in regards to any further changes you would like to make.

A form of the legal opinion is attached to the confirm. As to point #1, we have no way of confirming this on our own and I understand from Brent Hendry that because of various peculiarities with Bermuda law, our only way of gaining comfort on this is through the legal opinion process. As to point #2, we have gotten some comfort from our legal counsel on this but again it is appropriate to have AIG's counsel opine as to this.
