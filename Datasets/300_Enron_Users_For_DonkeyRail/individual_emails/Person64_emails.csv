"Keoni, I thought your email regarding the running of CONG with a heuristic rather than optimal solution may address and solve the problem. I have not yet been able to pull up ""corrected"" prices but hopefully they will now reflect our bids. The problems I referred to in my phone message last week were similar to what my original email detailed. Basically, we were awarded mw's on a congestion management schedule and the published prices did not match our bids. Will the change in running the ""solutions"" change this? Our volume management group will then be inputing our bid price rather than the published congestion management price--as those prices are not yet published correctly. I will be in the office this week and can be reached at your convenience.

FYI - Roger called today to inform us of a [Mark Hall] [transmission capacity] bottleneck at Palo Verde. Apparently, El Paso cannot take more than 50 mw into their system at Palo in any given hour; therefore, we [Mark Hall] [will] need to monitor El Paso's net schedule to [Mark Hall] insure [Mark Hall] (sic) that it does not exceed this. This poses some obstacles and opportunities related to the lending agreement. If El Paso is taking a net of 50 mw in at PV, you'll need to procure energy at Four Corners or Greenlee [Mark Hall] [or buy transmission/do a buy/resell with SRP-PNM-TNP-APS-etc.] to fill the lending short [Mark Hall] note-EPE will still deliver us energy at PV- , then enter a zero priced buy-resale [Mark Hall] in enpower to get the energy from an alternate delivery point to PV.

Certainly the ability to go long or short into R/T will be important and hopefully the CISO will follow through on its efforts to ""strive for simplicity and transparency."" Any idea what the penalties for being long or short in R/T might be? In the CISO's proposal the first two ""goals"" for the real time market appear to be at odds with each other. Also, I think we should push to rid ourselves of 10-minute dispatch at tie points. I understand the CAISO keeping the ADS in-state but it has not worked at tie-points.

In an effort to curb El Paso settlements issues, I've requested several sets of tapes over the past few days. As you know, these are the most reliable resource we have in determining the truth behind our everyday dealings. However, none of the taped conversations I've listened to recently have made mention of the time they were being traded for; many didn't name a delivery point; and some left out a price. Because mistakes are almost inevitable in a job as abstruse as yours, re-confirming deals just after making them is a valuable habit to form. A quick summary at the end of the conversation can potentially clear up discrepancies at the moment they're created, or serve as a tool for resolving them if they make it further than that. (This looks good --though no one will know what you mean by abstruse--you might want to clear up the language regarding summarizing at the end of the deal.

"Group, We have had some issues with EpmiCalPool deals recently and I wanted to provide information for newer members of the group and a quick reminder for crusty veterans as we head into the Thanksgiving Holiday. I have also decided to change our protocol for entering multiple EpmiCalPool deals. Please pay special attention to #5 below. So, some basic rules about EpmiCalPool deals. 1. EpmiCalPool deals are BUY-RESALE deals--(a transmission deal will work but is not the preferred method) 2. We only BUY from the EpmiCalPool-no exceptions-. 3. EpmiCalPool deals have a $0 price in the buy and sell portions. Please do not enter a price on an EpmiCalPool deal. 4. EpmiCalPool deals must have a delivery point of an CISO tie point or an CISO congestion zone. Good delivery points would be: Malin, COB N/S, COB S/N, NOB N/S, NOB S/N, Cascade, Captain Jack, Summit, Four Corners 345, Mead 230, Paloverde, NP-15, ZP-26, SP-15. Bad delivery points would include: Mid-C, Hotsprings, Hidalgo, BC Border. 5. IMPORTANT CHANGES TO BUSINESS PRACTICE HERE EpmiCalPool deals are used to simulate the purchase of transmission from the California ISO. a.) If you have a wheel from tie point to tie point for example Malin to Four Corners for congestion management--than an EpmiCalPool deal from Malin to Four Corners would be appropriate. For seperate wheels from tie point to tie point we will NOT be putting",bill.williams@enron.com,"john.anderson@enron.com, todd.bland@enron.com, craig.dean@enron.com,

Please record this information in the dispatch log. This can be accessed through the 'Albertapower' site. Scroll down from Fundamentals to Admin, and at the bottom of the page is the dispatch log. The fundamentals site can be found at http://albertapower/xnav/default.htm ? SD4 has all of its power offered into the Pool at $5. That's 353MW @ $5.

"For all cuts the following procedures apply... 1.) Notes as usual 2.) In the Enpower Path Confirmation, we need to make cuts as Path Confirms. Enter comments in the confirmed section. We will be zeroing Enpower deals out on Monday (hint: NOTES are VERY important--All CUTS must be notated and the notes must be put in the accordion folders). 3.) Try to have the counterparties continue any paths around us. Just ""bow out"" gracefully if you have no other options with the words ""L - D's."" 4.) If we are cut by a generator/utility going into California, we must call the HA desk at California and tell them the increment that we will be underscheduling our load by. For example, EPE will be cutting all schedules going into California on light load (100 mws). If we cannot resupply the schedules we need to tell the state that we are underscheduling our load by 100 mws. THIS IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT. We have posted an LC with Cali for this reason. Also, EPE will be long RT 100 mws off-peak as they are no longer selling to us. 25 mws should be sold to TEP to cover a forward schedule. Stacy has set this up at PV. Please do this as a direct bill with EPE. As of Jan 01, 2002 we will no longer be marketing for EPE.

"Sound reasonable? Or should I be more firm? A reminder.... In an effort to curb El Paso settlements issues, I've requested several sets of tapes over the past few days. As you know, these are the most reliable resource we have in determining the truth behind our everyday dealings. However, none of the taped conversations I've listened to recently have made mention of the time they were being traded for; many didn't name a delivery point; and some left out a price. Because mistakes are almost inevitable in a job as abstruse as yours, re-confirming deals just after making them is a valuable habit to form. A quick summary at the end of the conversation can potentially clear up discrepancies at the moment they're created, or serve as a tool for resolving them if they make it further than that.

"An interesting anecdote about your good friend Gray....

THE STATE Renewed Ethics Attacks Put Davis on the Defensive * Politics: The governor's conflict-of-interest problems with his energy advisors give GOP rival Bill Jones a ray of hope for his struggling campaign by MARK Z. BARABAK, TIMES POLITICAL WRITER In 1998, when Gray Davis first ran for governor, his Republican rival tested a series of attacks on Davis' ethical conduct. There were charges that he improperly used state workers in a previous campaign, accusations that he placed cronies on the state payroll and questions about possible conflicts surrounding Davis' voracious fund-raising activities. But when voters heard the allegations, they simply shrugged them off. The response was, ""He's a politician. Of course he does stuff like that,"" recalled one GOP strategist who sat in on the voter interviews conducted for Republican nominee Dan Lungren. The campaign shelved its line of attack and Democrat Davis romped to a landslide victory. Now he is under renewed assault for alleged ethical lapses, this time surrounding the state's electricity crisis. The issue has put the governor and his campaign aides on the defensive just as the state's power crunch appears to have finally eased.

"Two things - 1. Weather Tracking - Did we decide to ask Fundamentals about tracking forecasted-to-actual temperatures? Or would you me to organize this specifically for Real Time? 2. BPA Transmission Losses - Would you prefer that we pay back losses on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis? For billing purposes and general clarity, I think we should keep loss charges separate from actual transmission costs (i.e. pay them back in an annuity each day, week, or month as opposed to adding them into each reservation charge - too much room for error).
