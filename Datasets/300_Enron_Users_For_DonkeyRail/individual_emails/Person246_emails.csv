First of all, all new laptops came with both CD and floppy drives so if he is the orginal owner have him check in the bag. If it was a redeployed system he may not have received all the pieces. With that said, an internal floppy drive will run about $75 for the Compaq M700 laptop.

First of all, all new laptops came with both CD and floppy drives so if he is the orginal owner have him check in the bag. If it was a redeployed system he may not have received all the pieces. With that said, an internal floppy drive will run about $75 for the Compaq M700 laptop.

If PG&E fails to comply with our request for assurance of creditworthiness, the ""Termination"" provisions of Section 16.1(b) of our General Terms and Conditions will be triggered. If PG&E fails to perform any obligation under a service agreement, TW may terminate the agreement under the following procedure: 1) TW serves written notice on PG&E that it is in default, and that TW intends to terminate the agreement, 2) PG&E gets 30 days to remedy the default, 3) if PG&E does not remedy the default within 30 days, the agreement shall become null and void, after we obtain the requisite regulatory approvals, which Shelley advises me would include obtaining abandonment authority from FERC.

I believe Drew and Shelley concur (and they are welcome to add their comments, of course). If PG&E fails to comply with our request for assurance of creditworthiness, the ""Termination"" provisions of Section 16.1(b) of our General Terms and Conditions will be triggered. If PG&E fails to perform any obligation under a service agreement, TW may terminate the agreement under the following procedure: 1) TW serves written notice on PG&E that it is in default, and that TW intends to terminate the agreement, 2) PG&E gets 30 days to remedy the default, 3) if PG&E does not remedy the default within 30 days, the agreement shall become null and void, after we obtain the requisite regulatory approvals, which Shelley advises me would include obtaining abandonment authority from FERC.
