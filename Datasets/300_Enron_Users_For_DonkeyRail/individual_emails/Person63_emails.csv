We are starting on your drafting work now that we have received the engagement letter. We have a few questions that need answering, as follows: 1. I need David to send me materials on Morgan Stanley Trust Co. so that we can properly designate the right entity by correct name, etc. If they have any suggested or required language for our documents, I need to see that as well. Finally, I need for David to confirm with Morgan Stanley's fiduciary people whether Morgan Stanley can serve as a co-agent under a Statutory Durable Power of Attorney and whether there are any constraints or limitations in doing so that would impact our drafting. David can follow-up directly with me if that suits you. 2. I want to remind you to send me a photocopy of Caron's ""old"" trust document, so that we may consider whether it fits the current plan and can serve as a receptacle under the current plan. Sending it out today 3. We talked about setting up Debbie and MSDW as co-executor and co-trustees under your Will, with Caron as back-up to Debbie in that position. However, we are also going to create a generation-skipping trust right away for Caron. Who should be the initial trustee(s) of Caron's trust?
