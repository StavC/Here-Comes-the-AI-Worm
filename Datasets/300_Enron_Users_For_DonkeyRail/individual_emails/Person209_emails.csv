"The attached spreadsheet allows you to easily calculate Eco's year-end LNG inventory for a variety of cases that vary dispatch rate, # days of outage for CT1, and number of cargoes diverted between now and year-end. Simply enter your assumption for number of days of CT1 outage in cell A16 and the number of cargoes you want to divert in cell A23. The year-end inventory is automatically calculated. A negative number means that you require more LNG than you are entitled to receive. Assuming that you want the LNG tank full at year-end: 1. Eco will be able to receive 100% of the remaining 6 cargoes if the CT1 outage is 60 days or less 2. 175 days of CT1 outage are required to result in Eco being able to divert 1 cargo and still have a full tank at year-end 3. a 60-175 day outage for CT1 results in surplus LNG but whether or not it is enough to market depends on how much the outage exceeds 60 days The above figures assume a 76% dispatch and 95% availability on days that Eco is not assumed to be in an outage.

"Stephanie, Transwestern has been in discussions with ENA since very early December regarding the sale of the Enron Compression Services gas. The ECS off take is supposed to be 11,000 per day. The fact that ECS was not able to nominate their gas has been problematic for Transwestern in that it causes our line pack to be higher than it otherwise would be. When we began discussions, we were open to the idea of getting the full volume out of our system by the end of the month. If a nomination could have been made that resulted in a sale starting at the beginning of this week, ECS could have sold the entire 363,000 in December. At some point, it becomes unrealistic to expect to be able to do that. It has taken ECS so long to arrange for an agent that a now we are looking at selling the entire volume in just 12 days (~30,000/day). I was expecting the following two things from ENA, 1) confirmation from you that ECS was set up to sell their gas, and 2) a start date for a sale with some advanced notice. I would then have conferred with operations to see if it would be possible to move the entire 363,000 in December. I did not expect ENA to arrange the sale before circling back with TW. If I had known that you were about to close a sale, I could have arranged to be pulled out of my meetings Tuesday afternoon. I have advised Patti Sullivan that TW is able to deliver 25,000/d through the end of the month. The balance can be delivered in January.

"Mariella, Below is the pricing for ProCaribe's LPG purchase. There are four price tranches. The two fixed price tranches of 2600MT and 1768 MT represent volumes sold and yet-to-be-sold during the time frame April 16th to May 31st. Note that ProCaribe's revenue stream for the portion of LPG sold during the second half of April (~1400 MT) was based on Mont Belvieu of $0.543/gallon. Month-to-date Mont Belvieu for May is $0.5145/gallon. ProCaribe's revenue for volumes sold in May (~2900 MT) will be based on the average Mont Belvieu price for the entire month. Pricing of this cargo has worked out such that ProCaribe will make approximately 1-cent per gallon more margin than it would had they purchased LPG at a 7-cent per gallon premium to average Mont Belvieu for the month in which the sales occurred.

"Suzanne, I have entered into 2 swap transactions with Lee Jackson to alter the pricing formula for ProCaribe's latest LPG cargo. The swaps will be entered into your LPG book. The swaps are as follows: On 8/31/01 you ""sold"" 1,510,900 gallons (2900MT) of September MB NON TET Propane at a price of $0.41250 per gallon. On 8/29/01 you ""sold"" 1,146,200 gallons (2200MT) of October MB NON TET Propane at a price of $0.41875 per gallon. For the sake of clarity: ""Sold"" means that you will pay Lee the average of the month MB NON TET propane price for the months of September and October (""floating price"") for the volumes specified above. In turn, Lee will pay you the fixed prices stated above for the volumes above. As a result of these swaps, the price ProCaribe pays you for the recent cargo will be as follows: 2,900 MT (1,510,900 gallons) @ Average September Non-TET Mont Belvieu plus 7.063 cents per gallon ($0.41250 + $0.07063 = $0.48313) 2,200 MT (1,146,200 gallons) @ Average October Non-TET Mont Belvieu plus 6.438 cents per gallon ($0.41875 + $0.06438 = $0.48313) Remainder of Cargo (approx. 3400 MT) @ Average Mont Belvieu for 3 days around bill of lading plus 7 cents per gallon ($0.41313 + $0.07 = $0.48313) Note that NET OF THE SWAPS, you will receive a fixed price of $0.48",paul.y'barbo@enron.com,"b..clapp@enron.com, miguel.maltes@enron.com","'Suzanne' : 'person', 'Lee Jackson' : 'person'",2,ProCaribe - Hedge of August Cargo,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,sent,paul.y'barbo@enron.com

For smaller lot sizes (8,600 - 11,800 MT), the rates are abt.: $50 - $60 W. Africa to Med and $60 - $80 W. Africa to Caribs however, the larger cargoes (20,000 - 30,000 MT) curently moving are as follows: $30 - $40 W. Africa to Med and $40 - $60 W. Africa to Caribs So, in comparison to the Med, the additional freight incurred on moving a 8,600 MT cargo to Puerto Rico vs a 20,000 MT cargo to the Med is $40.00, or for an 11,800 MT cargo $20.00. Granted, these are not negotiated numbers, so they could be slightly better. Let me know your thoughts. Just keep in mind that PDVSA is there to supply an October cargo at +7.

"Kim, Thank you for your time on Wednesday. I enjoyed meeting you and appreciated the discussion regarding pipeline economics. I was thinking about the capacity you sold in 2003 on an Index to Index basis. On the attached diagram, the boxes colored black represent my understanding of your current position (you are locked-in to $1.00/MMBtu for the Calif. Border Index minus San Juan Index but exposed to San Juan Basin gas prices for the fuel required to deliver 20,000 MMBtu/d to the Calif. Border). You can easily lock-in your cost of fuel gas as shown by the swap colored in red. I believe that you did this capacity trade when gas prices were higher, therefore you could fix your fuel cost at today's lower prices and earn a higher margin on your capacity sale than originally expected. The decision to unwind the Index to Index hedge that you did with ENA is a tougher call. The unwind would be accomplished by the swap colored blue. Which do you prefer: 1. $1.00/MMBtu or 2. $0.40 + (Calif. Border minus San Juan Indices) per MMBtu ? Unwinding at $0.60/MMBtu, you must believe that Calif. Border Index minus San Juan Index will be greater than $0.60/MMBtu. I am not very familar with those pricing points so I can not give an educated opinion. Anyway, I hope that this is useful.

"Note: It is not too early to be thinking about the possibilty of buying a replacement Winter LNG cargo for the Eco project (see Article 12.3 (b) (iv) of the Cabot contract). My interpretation of the contract is that you avoid the Commodity Charge, Commodity Surcharge, Demand Charge, and Demand Surcharge on one Standard Cargo if Cabot cannot commit to Delivery of the Winter Cargo. For 2002, these add up to over $7.00/MMBtu based on current estimates of how 2001 prices will settle. December/January Nymex prices are ~$5.60/MMBtu. I believe that should mean that Puerto Rico should be able to land a cargo at near $5.00.

"Based on today's closing NYMEX prices there is $1.9 MM of price difference between EcoElectrica's 2002 Winter Cargo Commodity Charge plus Commodity Surcharge and the delivered cost of 83,000 CBM of LNG. That is $5.61 vs $4.61. This assumes we pay a day rate of $50,000/day for the vessel, Jan '02 NYMEX is $5.41, and the FOB price for LNG is $2.66. Let's stay in touch about the possibilty of landing a spot cargo into Puerto Rico in January. As we discussed, how we play this with Cabot is a big issue. There could be an additional $4.7 MM of value that could be captured by Eco if Cabot were unable to release its right to not deliver a Winter Cargo. Also, let's continue to think about how we make the logistics work and how we can get Cabot's cooperation if needed. Also, note that Eco may need 2 cargoes of this size to make it until the Early Spring Cargo.

This reduced the VaR on the TW fuel book from $841k to $421K. I did not remove the natural long position that was physically contracted (10,000/d) from Caminus. To summarize, we had 20,000/d of natural long, 20,000 was swapped to a fix price, and 10,000 was physically contracted to perfect the fixed price hedges.

"Paul, The information that follows was provided by Luis Ayala Col?n Sucrs., Inc, the PDVSA shipping agency in Puerto Rico. These are actual port costs using the LPG/C Nelly Maersk which is the vessel servicing Empire Gas Company this year. The following are the port costs estimates (quite close): 1. Barrels discharge per trip at CORCO - 30,000 bbls., Tropigas - 24,000 bbls., Liquilux - 20,000 bbls., One trip is three ports and another trip is two ports per month. 2. Discharge rates were given to us on an hourly basis and the agents took the average time per docking: CORCO - 48 hours or 625 bbls/hr., Tropigas - 28 hours or 857 bbls/hr., Liquilux - 20 hours or 1,000 bbls/hr., 3. Port costs at: Tallaboa $18,000 CORCO $18,000 Tropigas $13,000 Liquilux $17,000 Liquilux port costs are per the Port of Ponce tariffs which are different from the Puerto Rico Ports Authority tariffs which apply to Tallaboa, Guayanilla and San Juan. At San Juan (Tropigas) the tug boats cost less due to the fact that all tug boats companies are docked within the San Juan bay. 4. Port costs are not included in the vessel costs. 5. Port costs includes dockage, wharfage, harbor pilots, tug boats, and harbor fees. ProCaribe charges the dockage and warfage to the shipping agent.

"Thanks so much and GREAT WORK! Miguel, can you translate the pricing below (given the decreasing tendency of MtB) into terminal margins per gallon? How does this compare to our normally expected margin of 5 cents or so? You can do this for sales for which prices are known; if you wish, estimate the rest. Thanks -----Original Message----- From: Y'Barbo, Paul Sent: Tuesday, May 22, 2001 5:19 PM To: Mahan, Mariella Cc: Maltes, Miguel; Curran, Greg; Haeussler, Federico Subject: FW: LPG Cargo - Pricing Update Mariella, Below is the pricing for ProCaribe's LPG purchase. There are four price tranches. The two fixed price tranches of 2600MT and 1768 MT represent volumes sold and yet-to-be-sold during the time frame April 16th to May 31st. Note that ProCaribe's revenue stream for the portion of LPG sold during the second half of April (~1400 MT) was based on Mont Belvieu of $0.543/gallon. Month-to-date Mont Belvieu for May is $0.5145/gallon. ProCaribe's revenue for volumes sold in May (~2900 MT) will be based on the average Mont Belvieu price for the entire month. Pricing of this cargo has worked out such that ProCaribe will make approximately 1-cent per gallon more margin than it would had they purchased LPG at a 7-cent per gallon premium to average Mont Belvieu for the month in which the sales occurred.
