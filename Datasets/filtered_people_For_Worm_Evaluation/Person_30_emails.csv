"Suzanne,  I glanced at the presentation.  It looks good.   Two comments: 1.  Could we use our older machines for home use?  They are still very good  they just aren't the newest technology.  All are fast, CD ready  with plenty  of memory.  It could knock the cost down significantly. 2.  I would have the cost of Houston only to start with as a pilot.  That  would reduce our initial costs significantly even for NA.  I recommend that  you at least know what that cost is as a fall back position.  Good luck.

Up until recent CATS maintenance shutdown on 15 May, they were making up for  reduced production volumes by nominating to supply gas at the NBP which they  are entitled but not obliged to do.  Since return from outage at the end of  May they have declined to nominate at the NBP.    From 1 January to 15 May, the Sellers use of the NBP delivery option kept  underdeliveries to 350 mmcf (ie one day's maximum quantity) in total.  Since  returning from the maintenance shutdown, underdeliveries have totalled 850  mmcf ( averaging 77mcf/d ).  We believe that following the sharp rise in market prices during the  maintenance period, they have decided to default on the contract rather than  make up deliveries from other sources.   They have an effective cap on the  penalties of about 5 pence per therm (after taking into account the value of  the liquids) and therefore they are not making up the volumes when the daily  price is substantially higher than about 16 pence per therm.  Prior to the CATS shutdown, we had made them a proposal to enable them to  deliver additional volumes at  another alternative to avoid default but they  have not responded yet.  You mentioned that in your negotiations with Phillips they had committed to  getting us all the gas regardless of the cap on the penalties.  This has cost  us about $1.5 million to date and they seem to be institutionalising their  non performance.    Perhaps a phone call by you might help.

Agip is  particularly adversely effected (as Agip in particular lacks reserves in the  area).  I understand the development of Jade by BG and Phillips and the  squeeze down of Texaco and OMV, the other Jade owners, by Agip  to sell their  gas to Agip was driven by this lack of reserves.  You will recall that liquidated damages was a big issue they wanted to retain  them rather than actual damages and we insisted that they remained at the  same absolute level as in the old agreement, so I believe they are 40% of the  new price (my memory is fading also).  I do recall that they all insisted  that they would deliver the gas.  However, as with most companies the players  have all moved on and a contract is a contract, afterall this was our  approach.  Also I am sure they intended to maximise production from J-Block  and did not forsee a shortage of production.   It would be interesting to know if this is an agreed policy by them or  whether one of the sellers is blocking the NBP sale by refusing to  co-operate, they could do this because of the Common Stream Agreement.   Presumably they have not yet split the 3 agreements yet.  As to opportunity if they are short of reserves, perhaps they can buy  themselves out of the situation, especially while the contract is in the  money.  With my adversarial hat on perhaps BG want revenge for their loss in the  appeal courts?   This is probably nearest to the truth.

Mike     Stephen R Horn 06/06/2000 07:05 PM To: Mike McConnell/HOU/ECT@ECT, Jay Fitzgerald/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Allan  Sommer/Corp/Enron@Enron cc: Ellen Fowler/HOU/ECT@ECT, Drew Ries/HOU/ECT@ECT  Subject: InfrastructureWorld.com--Memo from Larry Izzo  Please read the attached memo from Larry Izzo. He is obviously wanting to  resurface Infrastructure World.  As you will note in the last paragraph, he  is basically staking out a position that EECC is going to have to spend $2  million on project management software development and  that he can capture  free optionality of doing a deal with infrastructure world.  On the surface of it, this does not make sense on several dimensions:  1. It is not clear to me why EECC has to spend $2 million on project  management software development. By definition, such software would want to  be collaborative  and I don't understand the logic of why we would do it  ourselves.  2. If there is a seperate carve-out of project management software that is  required for what we do that is separate from what existing functionality of  Cepren, Buzzsaw and Bidcom is doing; we may have an opportunity to do joint  development with any of these players. The question is picking who we think  would be a winner and figuring out if there is a deal to be done. Allan and  Drew, together with the EECC, have orchestrated meetings next week with these  three companies to figure out ways that EECC may be able to work together  with one of them. I would note that Bechtel is an investor in Cephren so it  is not clear that they expected these to entities to be directly competitive.  It is not clear that Infrastructure World is preferable to one of these other  alternatives.  3. It is obviously not my call as to whether EECC needs or will spend $2  million for Project Management software development (although I am  skeptical). From an investment perspective, there has not been that much that  has progressed on Infrastructure World in the last six to eight weeks. The  principal change has been a significant revaluation  and critical assessment  of B2B business plans and particularly revenue models. I would thus say that  two months ago my assessment given the Bechtel/Hull involvement that there  was a 75% ability to do legitimate VC at $5 to $10 million pre-money (as  opposed to the $15 million that it was done at). I would say that the  probability would be 25% of $5 to $10 million with significant risk of doing  subsequent rounds. I would thus have a view that we should pass from an  investment perspective.

Since return from outage at the end of  May they have declined to nominate at the NBP.

We believe that following the sharp rise in market prices during the  maintenance period, they have decided to default on the contract rather than  make up deliveries from other sources.   They have an effective cap on the  penalties of about 5 pence per therm (after taking into account the value of  the liquids) and therefore they are not making up the volumes when the daily  price is substantially higher than about 16 pence per therm.  Prior to the CATS shutdown, we had made them a proposal to enable them to  deliver additional volumes at  another alternative to avoid default but they  have not responded yet.  You mentioned that in your negotiations with Phillips they had committed to  getting us all the gas regardless of the cap on the penalties.

"Philippe,  I did talk to Skilling about this.  I must have forgotten to call you.  Jeff  really does want it around, you were correct.  Is there a compromise solution  here?  Maybe a smaller room with a control center vs an entire floor?  Think  about items like that and lets discuss.  At this point in time, lets not  assume we have the option to move it from the new building, at least not all  of it.  One key consideration is the cost savings by moving it to Ardmore.

Thursday's schedule is fairly set, and we are working  on Friday.  Thursday morning through to the afternoon we would present to you  the current state of the business and the initiatives/proposition/etc for  enron.co.jp.  This would take us through mid afternoon.  We would then go  over to EPower and we would ask you to give a talk on the state of technology  at Enron and the initiatives within Net Works.  We would bring EJ over to  EPower for your talk.  Afterwards we would have drinks with the main  commercial team at EPower and EJ.  Dinner to be arranged for a smaller  group.  On Friday, we would like to use the time to set up some meetings with  key IT/tech companies here in Japan.  To date, we have not yet met any of  these companies, but there is currently an extraordinary amount of activity  in the country.  We are looking to leverage some of Enron's banking  relationships to get as high a level meeting as possible with the likes of  Softbank.  We are also asking for other suggestions from the banks.  We are  also considering a potential talk with the American Chamber of Commerce on  Enron and Enron Technology.

We are clearly trying to avoid the traps that we ran into in  Europe and in the US.  Faster, quicker, smarter.  Thursday sounds great and  just let me know about Friday.

Remember,  I  am not a technologist and therefore can't discuss technology specific  applications just the business concepts and potential ideas and  opportunities.  We clearly want your business insight wrt the setup and focus  of the business.  I will send you a presentation that we recently gave to  Sherriff.  It is mostly up to date although continually changing.  This will  help give you a feeling for what the landscape looks like.  On Wed, however,  I would like to take you through our web presentation and how this fits into  our overall strategy.  A couple of other questions about the trip.  Do you want me to make any  presentations while i am there or simply talk about our plans?  I don't think  presentations are necessary unless you would feel more comfortable or have  something particularly appropriate.  The discussion with EPower/EJ on  Thursday afternoon would be good if you could speak about Net Works and what  Enron is doing across the focus areas.  On Friday, I believe that in the  proposed meeting with Softbank a presentation is not necessary.  For the  ACCJ, if you had a couple of slides on Enron and our e-comm initiatives this  would be great.  We could put this together here if you would like as I have  a couple of your recent presentations.  Let me know.  Also, what is the  appropriate dress code.  The Japanese still dress up.  I'm afraid suits are  de rigour.  I am assuming suits but i didn't want to make any assumptions  about new cultures.  Do you have any cultural facts that you can fax me about  the do's and don'ts of both cultures?  We could try and find something, but I  think you will find that the Japanese are trying to become more western.   Despite what you have heard, this place is not as foreign as rumored.  Do I  have clear instruction how to take the train from the airport.  All of us get  back and forth on the train and the bus.  We can get you a driver, but you  won't get here any faster and is quite expensive (US$500 one way).  I  normally get a driver, I am uncomfortable in new countries that I can't speak  any of the language.  If there is a way to get lost, I'll find a way.  One more item, could you please have your assistant set up a message for me  at the hotel.  I am usually very stiff and sore after a long trip and it  really helps.  Make sure it gives me a enough time to arrive to the hotel  after the trip.  I would also prefer a female if that is acceptable to the  Japanese culture.  Ono will set something set up here.

Thursday morning through to the afternoon we would present to you  the current state of the business and the initiatives/proposition/etc for  enron.co.jp.  This would take us through mid afternoon.  We would then go  over to EPower and we would ask you to give a talk on the state of technology  at Enron and the initiatives within Net Works.  We would bring EJ over to  EPower for your talk.  Afterwards we would have drinks with the main  commercial team at EPower and EJ.  Dinner to be arranged for a smaller  group.  On Friday, we would like to use the time to set up some meetings with  key IT/tech companies here in Japan.  To date, we have not yet met any of  these companies, but there is currently an extraordinary amount of activity  in the country.  We are looking to leverage some of Enron's banking  relationships to get as high a level meeting as possible with the likes of  Softbank.  We are also asking for other suggestions from the banks.  We are  also considering a potential talk with the American Chamber of Commerce on  Enron and Enron Technology.  The ACCJ is one of the most active and largest  chambers in the world and bring in some quite interesting speakers.  We will  have more on this.  For the weekend we have recd some suggestions from the Hotel and will pass  these along to you shortly.  I will be travelling with you on Sunday on the trip to Seoul.

"Greg,  a couple of other thoughts and ideas for Monday's meeting.  I would like to discuss the entire process chain as part of the timelines,  personnel responsibilities and key action items.  I think this is another  good way to find any potential gaps and help prioritize various items and  assignments. Andrew Parsons Sr. Director (and superior performer) is a great and very  smart guy that can add a lot of value to the effort.  You will like him and  he will be a very valuable resource to add to the team - even if it is for a  couple of weeks.  He wrote the IT compliance process chain and could reverse  engineer difficult parts that are unique to the Ariba platform.  He has  others on his team that could help and I've asked him to think about his  existing AA resources that are available (some are working on ClickPaper  already). Other resources that have been identified to potential added firepower in the  short run:  Beth Pearlman, John Tollefson (IT), Bob Schultz (LK said she  could spare him without delaying phase 2 roll out), Dave Forester (not a good  option because it would definitely set back phase 2 roll out), Mary  Solmenson, Scott Mills, Berry Pearce, David Port, David Sweeny, Sally Beck  (advice and discuss additional resources). I did ask Louise to jump in (and i know you did too) to help on some quick  thoughts on process and lessons learned. I saw the process maps for EOL and I think they, or the simplified early  versions, are very important and key to a successful launch for ClickPaper. I went by to see Mark Palmer (he was out) and left him a voice mail on the  marketing effort and what Margarat Allen is doing.  I wanted him to make sure  that he understood the importance and priority of this effort. I also talked with Beth Pearlman about helping out (or assigning John  Tollefson) and I told her that we would be talking about this on Monday  afternoon.

From:  Greg Piper @ ENRON                           07/07/2000 06:49 PM    To: Mike McConnell/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: Jeffrey McMahon/HOU/ECT@ECT, Greg Whalley  Subject: Re: ClickPaper.com     First, thanks for jumping in on this.  I am confident we can get it done even  though it will be a fire drill.  We had a control or process matrix meeting today and it is all there, it was  just being held or managed in four places.  It will all  be pulled together  by Monday in one place (one complete document) and will have about 15 major  categories with specific tasks under each category with status, person  responsible, comments and date to be completed.  It will also have a complete  timeline. We can review that Monday and agree on its content.  Louise agreed  to review it as well.  As it relates to the people you mentioned, let me know how and/or who you  want to pull in after we agree on the control document.  That way we will  know which areas I have holes and how we can fill them.  Salley Beck called (she mentioned you had called her as well) and we agreed  that the ClickPaper's back office representative would officially be Scott  Earnest (he has been unofficially it for months and we have been working with  him for months).  She is going to get in place people to be our Product  Control Group for CP launch on July 24th.  Scott and Salley will work to  source it so that we have 3 or 4 people trained and ready on the 24th to  receive password applications, create customer profiles on ClickPaper and  start the applications through credit, legal and tax and finally get out user  IDs to clients.  We will leverage off the EOL process but not use their  people unless there is some emergency.  Remember, we are only setting up  people for paper so the process is somewhat simplified.  We also have a help desk person starting next week.  I don't have his name  yet, but we have him and one more on the way.  We will create for them a  brief manual and train them on the system as fast as we can.  I did have a good meeting with Louise and Dave.  We walked inch by inch  through getting a user ID and password to getting a trade done.  We have a  few holes, but it is not that far away.  She is going to think about a  process document for this and get back to me Monday.  I have a detailed EOL  one and we will give it our shot this weekend.  Let me know what Mark Palmer says.  He knows we have been using Margaret.  We  will sit down with Margaret again on Monday and detail for her the PR plan  and what she needs to do.  We still plan to go out with a fairly inclusive  mailing ( a letter) that does not include temporary IDs/passwords.  We will  tell them that the launch is coming and as special customers, we want to use  this time to get them pre-registered.  Besides, there is no way to test a  1000 temporary IDs anyway.  We will send those out later.  as I said earlier,  the goal is to replace the splash screen with the unsecure area (or garden as  Lousie would call it) by next for Friday or the following Monday. That way  people can surf the content and get registered.  On legal, I have been using Travis McCullough for at least four months and we  had a detailed discussion today about the contracts, what is needed and the  deadline. There is legal work left to do ( the current draft of the password  application doesn't work), but if Taylor can help, that would be great.  We  will get our commercial comments back to Travis by Monday.  I have a meeting Monday with Bill Bradford and Ted Murphy (with Bob Crane and  Hal as well) to discuss the issue of a manual interface and the control  issues associated with it.  Credit is fine, we have been working with  Bradford for months, but Murphy needs to understand the issues with manual  posting. I will also make sure they check with Rick Buy on his approval and  views.  The entire ENA Paper group has the link to our site and we will have all  their comments by the end of next week. They will also be given the complete  Net Works and ClickPaper story on Thursday at their offsite and are ready to  help the roll out.  We also have them scheduled to come in Saturday, July  22nd for the final testing of the system.  Remember, the 24th is a one (Enron)-to-many launch with a financial market  only.  ClickPaper is not the counterparty in the trade section, Enron is so  it is simply a new distribution channel for Enron's existing financial  offering.  Later, we will build it out for physical (probably sooner rather  than later).  Finally, I will incorporate the EOL link or transaction loop  but Louise said today that is October or November.  It will only be  many-to-many if someone comes in and makes a compelling case ($$$) to do so.  Thanks.  See you tomorrow.

We also have a help desk person starting next week.  I don't have his name  yet, but we have him and one more on the way.  We will create for them a  brief manual and train them on the system as fast as we can.  I did have a good meeting with Louise and Dave.  We walked inch by inch  through getting a user ID and password to getting a trade done.  We have a  few holes, but it is not that far away.  She is going to think about a  process document for this and get back to me Monday.  I have a detailed EOL  one and we will give it our shot this weekend.  Let me know what Mark Palmer says.  He knows we have been using Margaret.  We  will sit down with Margaret again on Monday and detail for her the PR plan  and what she needs to do.  We still plan to go out with a fairly inclusive  mailing ( a letter) that does not include temporary IDs/passwords.  We will  tell them that the launch is coming and as special customers, we want to use  this time to get them pre-registered.  Besides, there is no way to test a  1000 temporary IDs anyway.  We will send those out later.  as I said earlier,  the goal is to replace the splash screen with the unsecure area (or garden as  Lousie would call it) by next for Friday or the following Monday. That way  people can surf the content and get registered.  On legal, I have been using Travis McCullough for at least four months and we  had a detailed discussion today about the contracts, what is needed and the  deadline. There is legal work left to do ( the current draft of the password  application doesn't work), but if Taylor can help, that would be great.  We  will get our commercial comments back to Travis by Monday.  I have a meeting Monday with Bill Bradford and Ted Murphy (with Bob Crane and  Hal as well) to discuss the issue of a manual interface and the control  issues associated with it.  Credit is fine, we have been working with  Bradford for months, but Murphy needs to understand the issues with manual  posting. I will also make sure they check with Rick Buy on his approval and  views.  The entire ENA Paper group has the link to our site and we will have all  their comments by the end of next week. They will also be given the complete  Net Works and ClickPaper story on Thursday at their offsite and are ready to  help the roll out.  We also have them scheduled to come in Saturday, July  22nd for the final testing of the system.  Remember, the 24th is a one (Enron)-to-many launch with a financial market  only.  ClickPaper is not the counterparty in the trade section, Enron is so  it is simply a new distribution channel for Enron's existing financial  offering.  Later, we will build it out for physical (probably sooner rather  than later).  Finally, I will incorporate the EOL link or transaction loop  but Louise said today that is October or November.  It will only be  many-to-many if someone comes in and makes a compelling case ($$$) to do so.  Thanks.  See you tomorrow.  GP     To: Greg Piper/Corp/Enron@Enron cc:   Subject: ClickPaper.com   Greg,  a couple of other thoughts and ideas for Monday's meeting.  I would like to discuss the entire process chain as part of the timelines,  personnel responsibilities and key action items.  I think this is another  good way to find any potential gaps and help prioritize various items and  assignments. Andrew Parsons Sr. Director (and superior performer) is a great and very  smart guy that can add a lot of value to the effort.  You will like him and  he will be a very valuable resource to add to the team - even if it is for a  couple of weeks.  He wrote the IT compliance process chain and could reverse  engineer difficult parts that are unique to the Ariba platform.  He has  others on his team that could help and I've asked him to think about his  existing AA resources that are available (some are working on ClickPaper  already). Other resources that have been identified to potential added firepower in the  short run:  Beth Pearlman, John Tollefson (IT), Bob Schultz (LK said she  could spare him without delaying phase 2 roll out), Dave Forester (not a good  option because it would definitely set back phase 2 roll out), Mary  Solmenson, Scott Mills, Berry Pearce, David Port, David Sweeny, Sally Beck  (advice and discuss additional resources). I did ask Louise to jump in (and i know you did too) to help on some quick  thoughts on process and lessons learned. I saw the process maps for EOL and I think they, or the simplified early  versions, are very important and key to a successful launch for ClickPaper. I went by to see Mark Palmer (he was out) and left him a voice mail on the  marketing effort and what Margarat Allen is doing.  I wanted him to make sure  that he understood the importance and priority of this effort. I also talked with Beth Pearlman about helping out (or assigning John  Tollefson) and I told her that we would be talking about this on Monday  afternoon. Do we need to have Alan Aronowitz or Mark Taylor look over the agreements to  add a trading perspective?  A few thoughts,  see you tomorrow.  mike         ",philippe.bibi@enron.com,mike.mcconnell@enron.com,Re: ClickPaper.com,2000-07-10 02:25:00-07:00,sent

"Mike, Thanks for the response.  Yes, I would like a complete review of your  initiatives.  Please call Cathy at 36898 and get on my calendar for a 1 hour  update.  Thanks, mike   To: Mike McConnell/HOU/ECT@ECT cc:   Subject: Re: eCommerce Commercial & Origination List    Mike, In addition to our e-commerce activity (energy.enron.com), my team has a  number of ""e-business"" initiatives either under development or  consideration.  These initiatives relate to using internet technologies to  improve customer satisfaction, improve productivity, shorten the sales cycle,  etc, not directly to transacting per se.  For example, we are creating a  customer portal that will allow our existing customers to get access to a  variety of information--such as billing, energy usage, project status,  general news, etc.--all through a single browser view that can be customized  to present only the information that the customer's interested in.  Another  application we're exploring would use internet technology to streamline the  deal process through on-line collaboration with our prospective customers.   Although these wouldn't be considered traditional e-commerce initiatives,  they're examples of using the internet to create more value through better  execution in our business.    Do you want to start tracking these kinds of initiatives too?  There may be  opportunities in other BU's to use similar applications or otherwise take  advantage of our learning.

We are particularly interested in including a presentation on how Enron has  leveraged core competencies to take on a new role in the Internet economy,  including the Net Works initiative to create B2B websites for other  businesses and industries. We would be delighted to have you speak on this  subject at either the Atlanta or Chicago Summit.  I understand that you have already agreed to participate as a speaker in the  21st Century Internet Summit that will take place September 20-22 in Laguna  Niguel CA. That event, which has been organised by my colleague Lisa Weiner,  is targeted to an audience of CIOs in its focus on technology, whereas the  E-Business Summit targets CEOs in its emphasis on strategic business  transformation.  Thank you for your consideration of this invitation and I look forward to  following up with you following the holiday weekend.

"I am working on the presentation for the analyst meetings that are taking  place July 24-26.  Enron Net Works is being featured and as part of the  overall story Skilling wants to see some basic information on your businesses  (and a few other possible verticals and market places).  Please provide me  with these 3 specific items of information.  1.  Total market size for your business:  e.g.  Pulp and Paper is approx.  $300 billion. 2.  Your target market share of that total 3.  Targeted (or other comparable) margin that you would (or could) expect to  see  I realize this is subjective but I do need an answer to all 3 questions.  Put  any explanation that you feel is important or needed.  Also please quote the  source of the global market size.  When I get all the information, I'll go  through it with everyone.  We  also need to get the global size of the markets that we are considering  moving into and if you know any of these below, please let me know.

America) came to us from Cargill and knows a lot  of people there.  He has a couple of names that I have passed on internally  for consideration but I am sure they didn't go to the right place.  On a  recent trip to Sao Paulo, many of the ag products came up in meetings as good  opportunities for Enron to go in and change that industry.  Coffee, Orange  Juice, grains and sugar were brought up a lot.  D'Arcy may have traded an ag book for Cargill, I can't remember.  Anyway, I am passing this message and names on to you for consideration.  A  phone call to D'Arcy might also be worth a few minutes of your time.

If you don't mind, rather than send you a year old plan for a business that  didn't get off the ground, I suggest that I work (on my own time) on a  document that will speak better to Enron's needs, presenting the air  logistics industry background and mapping it to potential opportunities that  utilize Enron's core strengths.

It'll give you an excuse to sleep late in your own bed!  I envision a panel of the heads of e-business and technology at several major companies, including Don Paul from Chevron, John Leggate from BP Amoco, Bob Peebler from Haliburton and one or two others, to discuss a range of key issues.  Little if any advance preparation would be needed on your part.  We're trying to get either or both Keith Krach from Ariba and Mark Hoffman from Commerce One to provide the opener.  If both accept, we will probably have one deliver in the morning and the other at lunch.  Or maybe we'll have a mud wrestling contest.  Finally, we're much closer to Interactive Texas and wanted to see if there is anything you'd like mentioned about Enron technology initiatives during Jeff's introduction.  My wife Suzanne will be doing the intro.  She will have a wealth of broader market statistics, but you may have some milestones you'd like mentioned about EOL's progress or something else suited to this Texas business and government audience.

"Mark and David,  Below is my first stab at the organization memo.  I didn't over focus on  specific wording and I am not sure how you want to address the various groups  that will be affected.  I believe we need to address all of them by name and  they should probably be in alpha order as to not upset anyone on the order.  I also didn't know any other information that you may want to include with  regard to the successes from the group year to date.   Greg, Jeff and I are getting together for lunch tomorrow to discuss the New  Works organization.    I think that this should come from Enron's office of the Chairman vs. the  business units because it does affect 2 different lines of business and it  will have more impact and clarity for the other groups especially, my  departure from Net Works.

"David,   Thanks for the comments and updates.  I didn't know exactly how it was  structured.   I am waiting on the revised draft from Frevert.  After I get  that one I will circulate it to Greg for his additions for the Net Works  pieces.    I don't believe that we are going to add Shankman to the executive committee  right now.  I am assuming the same is for Lavo.  There may be an appropriate  time in the near future to make changes to the committee and they may be  considered then. I don't think they want to add any additional people at this  time.  Mark may have a different opinion and if he does, I am sure he will   add it.  I do think we should add that Mark is Chairman of all the organizations.

"David,  Attached for your information is an email from the CEO of Six Foot Studios.   This guy is the brother-in- law of Robin Gibbs, one of the top litigators in  the country.  Robin and his firm is used a great deal in our key cases for  Enron.  This looks like a cool company but I have no idea if you have any  interest in his company or it's products.  I do, however, need someone to  follow-up with him, even if it is a polite discussion that we don't have any  interest.  We need to respond in some manner.  I forwarded this a while ago  but he didn't hear anything.  He is successfully getting in to companies in Houston and Compaq is a big  supporter.  I hope there is an opportunity here.

Also, does anyone have the document showing the taxes and results by store? I only have the ""here's what we did, here's what we found"" letter.

It'll give you an excuse to sleep late in your own bed!  I envision a panel of the heads of e-business and technology at several major companies, including Don Paul from Chevron, John Leggate from BP Amoco, Bob Peebler from Haliburton and one or two others, to discuss a range of key issues.  Little if any advance preparation would be needed on your part.  We're trying to get either or both Keith Krach from Ariba and Mark Hoffman from Commerce One to provide the opener.  If both accept, we will probably have one deliver in the morning and the other at lunch.  Or maybe we'll have a mud wrestling contest.  Finally, we're much closer to Interactive Texas and wanted to see if there is anything you'd like mentioned about Enron technology initiatives during Jeff's introduction.  My wife Suzanne will be doing the intro.  She will have a wealth of broader market statistics, but you may have some milestones you'd like mentioned about EOL's progress or something else suited to this Texas business and government audience.  Look forward to your reply.

Mike, your efforts to communicate both updating events vis-a-vis the weekly call and overtures outside the group have been a great initiative and much appreciated.  It's made an important, productive impression on Enron employees ""outside""of Networks.  Look forward to further discussions all around.

Due to agenda constraints, Joe Kishkill has not yet had the opportunity to review.  As part of structuring the regional effort, it would be important to streamline and coordinate the due diligence and market study efforts. There appears to be some confusion between Houston and S?o Paulo over who is responsible for what. We may need to formally announce D'Arcy's and my roles, including the need to channel information through us into and out of the region.  Please let us know your thoughts.

We publish LNG Express and the related website www.LNGExpress.com.  LNG is a unique form of natural gas trade, representing some $20 billion per year and growing at 7-8%/year.  The industry is a fairly insular community.  Our publication, website, industry reports, databanks, annual conferences and consulting services have grown to be possibly the most visible.  LNG has a growing spot and short-term contract market. There is currently no exchange for global trades.  Nor is there an exchange for carrier vessel capacity, excess plant capacity, e-procurement or remote gas leases. LNGExpress.com could be platform for such an exchange with content and readers already established.  We might also assist Enron sign up exclusive agreements with LNG suppliers and/or buyers.  Please let me know your thoughts ASAP.  I suspect this window of opportunity will close quickly.

"Lea,  I like this and it gives us something to start with.  Let's us this as a ""living"" document and expand it with the thought that we  can present this to Ken as a presentation.  A few thoughts: Add a section of what the collection will not be. e.g.:  not so contemporary  that majority of people will have a very negative reaction.  Understanding  that not everyone will ever agree on everything Address a few ideas on key locations and options per key areas.  For  example:  5 key large major areas could contain the following themes - 1  large painting by commissioned contemporary recognized artists.  Present a  few artists as options and ideas.  Key trading areas:  could be modern and  high energy to reflect the culture or the opposite, more serene commentary as  a balance.  pick artists as an idea. Address key themes:  trading are will have xxxx, individual business unit  common areas can be distinct to their culture with guidelines such as xxxx.   Describe the area reserved for Enron  memorabilia? General theme considerations and guidelines: Innovation, global, as you've  already addressed List out options with front entry area (Nevelson) Address old building and what we are going to do with the collection:  for  example art work will be more consistent within business units and will be  re-aligned, common areas will link with new concepts and themes A few thoughts on budget and generally how it will be spent as a guideline:   e.g.:  20% will be spent on 5 key areas, 10% on trading floor areas.....

"Greg,  I didn't realize you were doing that, that's great.  I am sure they need your  help, so few people are willing to give back to their old collegiate   experiences.  My thanks as a Sig Ep.    I just changed jobs within Enron  (again) and have had a wild and difficult  morning and your email made me chuckle.  I have done a few things at OU, and  may be coming up in Sept. for a speech, and I'm not sure what pictures you  are talking about.  The business school took some pictures and so did the  Energy Management Program (the old PLM school) but I have not seen them nor  do i know what they did with any they took.  If you are talking about a  formal picture, I could provide one with my corporate bio if you need it for  some reason.   Thanks for the chuckle, mike  PS:  I have been called a lot of things including ""that God damned  McConnell""  but that is as close as it gets.

It has been an interesting experience. Some months back, it came to my attention that you have on occasion dropped by the house. I am not sure what you said or did, but some of those actives now think you are God. In fact, they put together a brochure that helped them win the President's Trophy, signifying the best fraternity at OU, and pictures of your visit were prominent in the brochure. We were kind of hoping that some more copies could be printed, but I am not sure where we stand. Just the same, I thought you would get a kick out of knowing that some of these guys are now getting down on their knees and saying their nightly prayers to you. It has created a bit of a problem in the pledgeship program. If you recall, many of the fraternity's principles were based on God, and some of the pledges seem to think Carter Ashton Jenkins was referring to you. I think with some hard work, this will not be an insurmountable problem, however.  HFF,  Greg  ",gkarnes@aol.com,mike.mcconnell@enron.com,Re: Sig Ep stuff,2000-08-16 05:44:00-07:00,sent
"George,   Thanks for the email.  Congrats on the getting non-binding bid, I think.   When we get a chance, after Sempra closes, please set up a meeting with all  of us and Frevert to discuss in detail.  Also include Jeff Donahue. You are  aware of my concerns and issues and we need to discuss them in great detail  before we move forward with Pacificorp.

Pacificorp advertises that each  machine is capable of producing synfuel at the annual rate of 1.5 - 2.0 mm  tons,  for a total of 6 - 8 mm annual tons.    We will meet with Pacificorp early next week in Portland to discuss a due  diligence schedule and ground rules for the sale.  We will obviously require  one or more qualified monetizers to work with us on this deal from day one.   If we line up more then one monetizer it would be helpful if we appoint a  single monetizer to be the lead, otherwise we may end up facing conflicting  demands from each monetizer.  Our ideal structure would have the monetizers immediately owning 100% of the  equity in the machines, while we provide the sites, coal supply, and synfuel  sales.  We need to work with the monetizers to identify qualified operators,  while not taking any operating risk ourselves.  Given the ""lease""  issue surrounding the Sempra deal, we need to make sure we  structure Pacificorp (and AIG) as a mtm deal.    We currently have a site team that has identified appropriate sites, and is  starting the preliminary engineering and permitting work on each site.  The  sites include river terminals and mines in West Virginia and Kentucky.  We expect to finalize Sempra this week ( 2 - machines on an accrual basis).    ""Team Synfuel"" will then focus their activities on AIG (3 - machines) and  Pacificorp (4 - machines) in order to close at least one of the deals by the  end of October.  Our goal remains to secure 4 - 6 machines by the end of the  year.

We believe Enron could benefit from using our highly scalable software to manage VPNs Enterprise-wide by:  1) Speeding up the setup and provisioning time for tens of thousands of VPNs. 2) Uniquely Vendor-Independent: Supporting all types of VPNs (Remote Access/Site-to-site/Extranet), based on equipment, products and technologies from Cisco IOS, PIX, Altiga, Nortel and Check Point. 3) Reducing training and support needs by using our easy-to-use, web-based GUI based on high-level policies, hiding low-level, vendor-specific interfaces. 4) Providing significantly higher levels of security and control VPNs via advanced features such as random policy auditing and proactive service monitoring.  We would be very interested in meeting with someone at Enron to find out how you would like to proceed. Who would you suggest we contact?

I was very moved by it and you know I feel the same way.  I have become very reflective with the more ""success"" that I have been fortunate enough to receive.  I am so thankful and appreciative and although I have always been religious and spiritual, it has grown more deeply.  I see so many people that have lost their perspective and I pray that I will remain grounded and truly appreciate the blessings that our family has received.  Chris and I often discuss how we can help others and what can we do to really make a difference.  The Jones and the McConnells are truly very lucky.   Thanks, and give my love to your family.

"Mike,  As a result of the recent reorganization, initially I will be responsible for  the Weather and Insurance trading activities.  I look forward to working with  you in these efforts.  What I really wanted to talk to you about is the JDF Walk.  Last year we  discovered that our 2 1/2 year old son, Brandon, had diabetes.  As you  remember, and certainly can relate to, this changed our lives forever.  In  retrospect, I am glad that I got involved in Enron's effort even though it  was in the last 3-4 weeks.  We have continued to stay involved with JDF by  attending several events, by visiting the JDF office, and by JDF's proactive  phone out-reach.  I would like to hear your take on sponsoring a team through  Enron vs. directly through JDF.  I know that Enron matches the contributions  if sponsored through Enron; is this possible if we were to go the other route?  Please call or email as I know we are approaching the campaign time.

I further  suggested that Enron could approach this business by leveraging EOL to act as  a non vessel owning common carrier, trading physical capacity while readying  the market (and ourselves!) for financial trading.

As Senior Vice President of Capital Markets at Chase Manhattan Bank, I launched an extremely successful derivative products/structured finance business in Texas and contiguous states. At Continental Bank, Citicorp and Motorola, Inc., I was responsible for a variety of innovative marketing and financial initiatives which included establishing new businesses, restructuring existing businesses and refinancing established or newly acquired businesses.  Attached is a copy of my resume. Qualities which have contributed to my success are:  ? Entrepreneurial. 3 of my last 4 positions were start ups or turnarounds. Experience with early stage ventures and acquisition identification. ? Partnership. Ability to build strong relationships by providing solid counsel and negotiating skills. Established and maintained excellent working relationships with other senior operating managers. ? General Management. Have held full P&L responsibilities. Established policies, programs and procedures to achieve growth objectives, including recruitment, evaluation and development of personnel. ? Core Competencies. Development and refinement of organization infrastructure, including external marketing, joint venture relationships, internal operations management, strategic planning and new product development. Have identified and concluded acquisitions. International experience.  I would appreciate the opportunity to speak with you about opportunities at Enron. I will call Cathy this Friday to see if there is an appropriate time when we may speak next week.  Sincerely,  Michael E.

"Can you please arrange for this message to be sent to all of Enron - Houston  this evening.  It should have Mike McConnell's letterhead and we would like  an opportunity to preview the final message before it goes out.  Please  contact me at X-36898 if you have any questions.  Thanks.    Cathy Phillips   It is my sincere honor to once again lead the Enron team in this year's  Juvenile Diabetes Foundation (JDF) walk scheduled to take place on Sunday,  November 5, 2000, at the Sam Houston Race Park.  I continue to serve on the  board of JDF representing Enron and will be Enron's corporate executive for  this year's fundraising efforts.  As many of you may already know, I am an insulin dependent diabetic myself.   Even though I know how difficult this disease can be to manage with the  multiple finger pricks for blood samples and several shots each day, I cannot  imagine how difficult it is for a small child with this disease.  Taking  insulin does not cure the disease nor prevent the development of  complications; insulin is simply their life support system and without it  they would die.  Enron continues to be a major corporate sponsor for JDF again this year.  JDF  is a very efficient organization in which approximately 84% of all money  raised goes directly to research.  Enron's goal this year is to raise  $225,000 and we need your help.  Enron has been the number 1 walk team for 5  years in a row and we are not ready to give up first place!  We need team  leaders, walkers and volunteers to help us reach our goal.  The theme for the  walk this year is ""Knock Out Diabetes"" and we would like to have you join us  for this great event.  The Walk is truly a blast and we had about 500 Enron  people participate last year and everyone enjoyed it.  If you are interested in volunteering to be a walker or a team leader, or if  you would like to make a pledge, you may call any of the steering committee  members listed below.  If you are interested in being a team leader, please  contact one of the following people immediately so that you may be included  in the first important and informative training session taking place this  week.

The car is great and it arrived in a time of chaos and was a very  pleasant distraction.  I am gathering information on my BMW so that I can sell that to the  dealership at the same time I pick up my new car.  I will have all my lease  information with me.  I have a few months left on the lease and will have all  the needed information to complete the transaction.  If you would, please  forward this to or let me know who I should deal with at the North side  dealership.  I don't want another Bob Brooks situation to occur.  Also I  don't want him dealing with the purchase of my BMW since I believe he is in  that part of the dealership now.   I expect a fair price for my car and with  our history, I don't want him involved in pricing my car.  I am confident  that someone else will be better to deal with and will give me a fair deal  with my cash purchase for the CL.  I guess I just need a name at the  dealership.

In the paper, I identified the hurdles we  would need to overcome in order to create a market for trading air cargo  capacity futures, none of which were deemed insurmountable.  I further  suggested that Enron could approach this business by leveraging EOL to act as  a non vessel owning common carrier, trading physical capacity while readying  the market (and ourselves!) for financial trading.  I am very interested in moving this business idea along here within Net  Works.  I have some ideas regarding likely industry partners that could move  us along rather quickly.

Josh Heupel,  who  completed 50% of his passes last week, but was inconsistent and  off-target  at times, bounced back with his usual superb showing against the Indians.  Heupel completed 24 of 32 passes (75%) for 301 yards, one interception,  and  three TDs. In the process, he tied former Sooner QB (now OU running backs  coach) Cale Gundy's career record for TD passes with 35. It took Gundy  four  years to set the record, while Heupel equaled it in only one year and two  games.  The Sooner special teams, which were solid but not spectacular against  UTEP,  had their moments against Arkansas State. The punt return game was  outstanding, as J.T. Thatcher broke Jarrail Jackson's single-game record  for  punt return yardage, set last season against Missouri. Thatcher's stellar  day included a 66-yard punt return for a TD and an interception from his  safety spot on defense.  ?

"Mike - I think we are doing a good job of isolating ourselves from the direct  risk of owning synfuel machines.  The equity owners are the ones at risk for  any amendments to Section 29 of the tax code.  Further, we have identified  the ""Class A"" machines in the market, those with the strongest PLR 's, legal  facts, and credit worthy owners, and have concentrated our activities on only  those machines.    We will be responsible for supplying coal to the machines, a short position  we enjoy today with our term sales of equity coal to Florida Powers' synfuel  group and traded coal to Sempra, and act as sales agent (obviously with  obligations to sell) for the resultant synfuel. The deals we are currently  negotiating with AIG and PacifiCorp are even more favorable then our Sempra  deal in that we will not be acting as operator of the machines.  We also  expect to receive mark to market  accounting treatment on the new deals.  As  point of reference we think AIG will be worth about $25 mm and PacifiCorp  north of $50 mm.  Although we have yet to mtm the Sempra deal, it is worth  about $25 mm on a mtm basis.   Between the above three deals we have over $100 mm of potential income this  year.  In addition we will enter into long term short positions with the  machines, which will allow us to expand our physical flows, and continue to  grow our business.  As an example, this year we will deliver about 12 - 15 mm  tons of eastern coal.  If we successfully conclude the AIG and PacifiCorp  deals, we will move an additional 11 - 13 mm tpy of eastern coal.  Sempra  will add another 2 mm tpy, for a total of 13 - 15 mm tpy.  We will be in a  position to virtually double our physical flows of eastern coal next year.  Synfuel has already had a significant impact on a number of regional markets.  Not only do we want to be in the synfuel business, we need to be in the  business in order to understand, anticipate, and take advantage of rapidly  changing market dynamics.  Synfuel represents a significant, fundamental  change in the coal business.  This changing market  will present new  opportunities for us to develop and exploit.  The key obviously is to be a  major player in both the synfuel and underlying coal markets in order to take  advantage of the information flows generated by each market.   We are already in the process of meeting with international customers about  supplying them with synfuel.  We have received a favorable reaction from both  the international utilities and steel mills.  We will gain a significant  competitive advantage in the international market by being in a position to  offer synfuel not only through Pier IX in Virginia (Sempra), but also through  New Orleans (AIG and PacifiCorp - via terminal sites on the Ohio River  system).  We have asked our regulatory people to stay on top of any activity in  Washington, and to date synfuel has not been a significant political issue.   Jordan has directed our outside tax people to monitor the IRS' temperature,   and their response to any letters they receive regarding synfuel from members  of Congress or the industry. The noise in the system has been primarily  generated by Arch Coal Co. who are not active in the synfuel market; and the  State of West Virginia, who would like to tax the production of synfuel.   The tax issue is one we will try to solve by pushing back on the equity.   Arch is no match for the combined legal and lobbying capabilities of the  large players now in the synfuel business - Florida Power, SCANA, PGE, AIG,  Sempra, PacifiCorp, Kentucky Utilities, TECO, Keystone Conemaugh, DQE,  Norfolk Southern, Fannie Mae, Drummond, Peabody (Lehman Bros.), Alliance  (Chase), Massey (Fluor) and Southern Company Services. In addition Aquila.  PSE&G, Duke, CP&L, VEPCO, Santee Cooper and others are working to locate  machines at their river terminal and generation sites.  I will be in Pittsburgh and West Virginia all of next week.  I would like to  schedule a meeting time for the group, and I will call in - preferably Monday  mid - afternoon or Tuesday late afternoon.  Angie will coordinate with  everyone to set a convenient time.

Note that in spite of the positive report, the Dabho breakwater is  still seriously behind schedule and, unless something changes radically, we  will be entering the 2002 monsoon period with only about two-thirds of the  breakwater complete.  DPC may not be able to take its 2002 volumes and will  either face take-or-pay or (hopefully) force3 majuere relief if the  breakwater delay can be attributed to construction force majeure.

Dan    EGYPT: Egypt agrees to reduce natural gas price.  09/18/2000 Reuters English News Service (C) Reuters Limited 2000.  CAIRO, Sept 18 (Reuters) - Egypt's Oil Minister Sameh Fahmy said on Monday the ministry had agreed with international companies to reduce the price of natural gas produced locally.  He told reporters after a cabinet meeting that approved the agreement that it would be submitted to parliament, which opens a new session on December 13 after general elections. Fahmy said the new gas pricing deal, which cuts the price Egypt pays to foreign companies for their share of gas produced in the country, would save the government $250 million a year.  He gave no details of the pricing structure, but said it would take effect from July, 2000, apparently referring to the start of Egypt's fiscal year (July-June).  The cabinet also approved plans to export natural gas and liquefied natural gas (LNG) to Turkey and Europe, he said.  Information Minister Safwat el-Sherif said Egypt would earn an initial $265 million a year from exporting gas by pipeline and about $280 million a year from LNG exports.  In July, Spanish electricity generator Union Fenosa signed a long-term gas contract with the state Egyptian General Petroleum Corporation to buy 40 billion therms of gas a year.  Spain's third biggest power utility is to receive the gas by pipeline. It said it had also agreed to invest $1 billion to build a liquefaction plant in Egypt by 2004.  In June BP-Amoco announced plans to develop an LNG plant to process and ship LNG to Mediterranean and other markets. BG International said in April it had agreed with EGPC and Italy's Edison International to build an LNG plant for export to unspecified buyers in the Mediterranean region.  East Mediterranean Gas, a joint venture of EGPC, Israel's Merhav Group, said in May it had begun talks with the Israel Electric Corp for laying an underwater pipeline to supply Egyptian gas to Israel.  It said it planned to build a 780-km (468-mile) pipeline able to carry up to 15 billion cubic metres of gas a year from Egypt to Turkey, with exits to Israel.  Egypt puts its proven reserves of natural gas at 42.5 trillion cubic feet and total reserves at around 120 trillion.

I was asked to contact you directly by my friend Abrar Sait, whom with I am sure you are acquainted.  I am currently a Vice President and Senior Officer of Chematch.com, a Houston-based online bulk petrochemical, polymer and fuel products trading exchange.  We founded the firm over one year ago, and things have been going quite well.  However, the landscape for our business model, industry market penetration, as well as increased competition has eroded the chance for strong revenue success of this company, and I wish to return to Enron, but staying within the dynamic, challenging high-tech areas, such as Broadband Services.  My responsibilities here at Chematch.com have been multiple-fold.  I have been directly responsible for the creation of the business strategy/plan (and its changes), the pro-forma financial statements and projections that permutate with the strategy, key strategic alliances with best of breed industry participants, venture capital raising process for 3 Series of funding, the Investment Banking presentations/diligence/IPO work, and currently head up Petrochem.net, the sister company within Chematch.com.  Prior to joining Enron, I graduated from the University of Chicago with a Master of Business Administration in Analytic Finance and Accounting.  Prior to b-school, I worked on Wall Street for 3 1/2 years in investment banking and capital markets.  Attached is a copy of my resume.  It could be a bit more detailed, but I prefer to keep it lean as it is easier to read, and I can always talk it through in detail.  My goal is to procure a challenging leadership position within a business developement role, such as Mergers & Acquisition, Venture Capital, or liasing between deal structuring and commercial marketers.

IN summary:  - The Prime mInister and Oil Minister are open to discuss this project, in the context of clear future needs, estimated at 400 BCF by 2005. As a matter of fact, the Oil Minister - Wa'el Sabri - brought in his senior team to the meeting and scheduled a working session with Enron for September 27, at 10:00 AM  - In addition, the Royal Court (Diwan) support this development and has sent to the meetings Dr. Bassem Awadallah, the Economic Advisor to King Abdullah  - The Amoco deal is dead: they had an axclusivity arrangement which ended recently and they had in mind a pricing scheme linked to the ""fuel being used currently"" or to oil prices, both of which were totally unacceptable to JOrdan  - Whatever deal there is will need to compete against the odds that the deal with Irak, which provides Jordan with virtually ""free"" oil, will keep as it is. In fact, it is this deal which has allowed the Government to procrastinate on the AMOCO discussions  - Jordan is comfortable that there is gas in Risha, close to the Irak border. Schlumberger are currently exploring in that region. The thing is that the government is convinced that whatever gas they may find in Risha should not prevent them fromstriking a deal for an import scheme  - The government has been approached by the Saleh Kamel group of saudi arabia, which believes thay may be able to set up a new company which will develop gas fields in the northwestern part of saudi (Tabouk) and export it to Jordan. This is still at a very preliminary stage, but appears to be of great interest to the jordanians  - IN addition, British Gas approached the minister with a new scheme, relying on gas discovered ""off the coast of Gaza and Israel, which will require a shorter pipeline. the thing is that the Jordanians feel uncomfortable with imports through Israel at this stage of the ""peace process""!  So here we are, welcome to pitch into this situation. I used the argument of speed of development and this is something we need to check with the Egyptians.  The course of action is as follows:  1. ENRON is to issue a letter to the Jordan Energy Minister (ASAP) stating the opportunity and formally requesting discussions. No MIDDLEMAN PLEASE...THIS WAS CLEARLY STATED BY THE PM and the Minister!. The address is: H.E. Eng.

Policy on Noncompetition.  I  would appreciate if you would check with your CEO/COO regarding this e-mail  and respond to me by Friday, September 29 if you have questions or concerns.   Enron APACHI may need to commit to the following provisions (that bind Enron  affiliates) by Monday, October 2.  Given the consolidating power generation market in Asia Pacific, Enron Asia  Pacific/Africa/China (Enron APACHI) is proposing to enter into a transaction  with Marubeni and Sithe Asia to combine the respective power generation  portfolios into a single company (Newco).  Newco would be charged with making  the shareholders' investments as liquid as possible to allow for sale of the  shareholders' respective stakes in Newco.    The shareholders believe that Newco must not be seen by the market as a  ""dumping ground"" for existing power projects but rather as the vehicle  through which the investors will continue to pursue power generation  opportunities in Asia.  As a result, Enron APACHI proposes to include  competition restrictions in the Marubeni/Enron Shareholder Agreement that  would bind their respective affiliates.    The following is a summary of these competition provisions:  Enron affiliates (with the exceptions stated below) could only develop or own  power projects in the Asia Pacific Region (as defined below) after first  offering the opportunity to Newco.  If Newco declines the opportunity, Enron  would be free to own the project itself or offer the project to third parties  provided that the terms do not materially improve.  Development or ownership  does not include the provision of construction, O&M, offtaker or risk  management services.  There are a number of exceptions to this rule:  (a) small projects involving  20 MW or less; (b) projects in which Enron owns less than a 1/3 interest; (c)  projects initiated by our SK joint venture; (d) Korean projects using natural  gas produced by Enron; (e) projects obtained in a corporate acquisition in  which Asia generation is less than 20% of the value of the acquisition; and  (f) situations in which any Enron company would be exposed to fiduciary  liability to another shareholder in complying with the competition  restriction.  ""Affiliates"" will be defined to exclude Enron affiliates which are  publicly-owned (e.g., Azurix).  ""Asia Pacific Region"" will be defined to include Brunei, China (including  Hong Kong and Macau), South Korea, North Korea, Taiwan, Vietnam, Laos,  Cambodia, Thailand, Myanmar, the Philippines, Malaysia, Indonesia, East  Timor, Singapore, Papua New Guinea and the Pacific Islands (including Guam,  Saipan, the Federated States of Micronesia, and Fiji, but excluding Hawaii).   It does not include Japan and Australia.  The competition clause would survive until the earlier of (a) Enron selling  its interest in Newco or (b) December 31, 2003.

Imagine this -  as of today, Austin has taken more than 16,425 shots and more than 27,300  finger sticks.  It never gets easier for him and it will never go away until  a cure is found.   Diabetes is the leading cause of kidney failure, adult  blindness and non-traumatic amputations, a leading cause of nerve damage,  heart attack and stroke.  Until a cure is found, his health is better today  than it will be tomorrow.   Please let me know if I can count on you to walk with me or help raise funds  for Juvenile Diabetes.  84% of the money raised goes directly to diabetes  research.   My commitment to you is this - walk with me - I guarantee you a  morning of fun, good times and the opportunity to meet a large, dynamic group  of people committed to finding a cure.  Sponsor me - you will help millions  of kids like mine that are desperately looking for a cure.    The walk is on Sunday, November 5, 9:00 AM - 4.5 miles at Sam Houston Race  Park.

Can you help me set up  the Enron match and then contact a coordinator so that we can show our  support.    Mike, Thanks for you sponsorship of this effort! ---------------------- Forwarded by Marty Sunde/HOU/EES on 09/22/2000 08:24  AM ---------------------------  Mike McConnell@ENRON 09/08/2000 09:59 PM   Sent by: Enron Announcements@ENRON To: All Enron Houston cc:   Subject: Juvenile Diabetes Foundation Fundraising  It is my sincere honor to once again lead the Enron team in this year's  Juvenile Diabetes Foundation (JDF) walk scheduled to take place on Sunday,  November 5, 2000, at the Sam Houston Race Park.  I continue to serve on the  board of JDF representing Enron and will be Enron's corporate executive for  this year's fundraising efforts.  As many of you may already know, I am an insulin dependent diabetic myself.   Even though I know how difficult this disease can be to manage with the  multiple finger pricks for blood samples and several shots each day, I cannot  imagine how difficult it is for a small child with this disease.  Taking  insulin does not cure the disease nor prevent the development of  complications; insulin is simply their life support system and without it  they would die.  Enron continues to be a major corporate sponsor for JDF again this year.  JDF  is a very efficient organization in which approximately 84% of all money  raised goes directly to research.  Enron's goal this year is to raise  $225,000 and we need your help.  Enron has been the number 1 walk team for 5  years in a row and we are not ready to give up first place!  We need team  leaders, walkers and volunteers to help us reach our goal.  The theme for the  walk this year is ""Knock Out Diabetes"" and we would like to have you join us  for this great event.  The Walk is truly a blast and we had about 500 Enron  people participate last year and everyone enjoyed it.  If you are interested in volunteering to be a walker or a team leader, or if  you would like to make a pledge, you may call any of the steering committee  members listed below.  If you are interested in being a team leader, please  contact one of the following people immediately so that you may be included  in the first important and informative training session taking place this  week.  Thank you very much for your support.

TO: Houston Area Employees Participating in the Domestic Medical Plan Benefits  You may have recently received communication from United HealthCare (UHC)  concerning Memorial Hermann Health Systems' (MHHS) decision to terminate  their contract with UHC  in the Houston/Beaumont area.  This communication  also included the names of physicians who will be dropped from the network  due to this action.  It is our intent to help you understand the situation.  It is our understanding that Memorial Herman Health Systems asked for a 40%  increase in fees - a substantial increase that would have been passed on to  you and Enron!  When United HealthCare attempted to negotiate with a counter  proposal, Memorial Hermann cancelled their contract.  While this contractual arrangement was between the hospital system and UHC,  Enron continues to support UHC in their ongoing contract negotiation  efforts.  At this time, it is only UHC which has been affected, however, it  is our understanding that Cigna has also been contacted by the hospital group  and may be in contract negotiations at this time as well.    Many doctors have obtained admission privileges to other area hospitals  within the UHC Network or have contracted directly with UHC including those  with admission privileges to The Woodlands, Sugarland and Clear Lake  Hospitals, to name a few.  In a further effort to limit disruption to our  affected employees and families who are enrolled in the UHC Network or EPO  options, Enron has authorized UHC to process claims incurred between  September 28 and December 31, 2000 as if the termination of the Memorial  Hermann Health Systems from the network had not occurred and In-Network  benefits applied.  Office visits will have a $10 copayment and all other  charges will be covered at 90%.  Hospital admissions will still need to be  pre-certified with UHC.  These steps have decreased the number of participants' affected by Primary  Care Physician disruption from 1,050 to 127.  If You Need Medical Attention:  You or your doctor/hospital must call UHC's  customer service number so proper benefits can be verified.  In some cases  the hospital or doctor may request payment at the time service is performed.   If this should happen, please obtain an itemized statement and submit it to  UHC with a claim form for prompt reimbursement.  Claim forms can be obtained  by calling 1-800-332-7979 or in Houston at 713-853-7979 ( press 1).  Open enrollment materials will be coming soon.  Take this opportunity to  consider your elections for 2001.    United HealthCare and Enron HR are committed to assisting Enron employees  through this transition.

The second paragraph of Wade's note below sums up  the current situation.  Bottom  line, if Metgas is sold down by Enron India  from 100% to 50%, we would lose the right to control unilaterally decisions  related to the use of the Dabhol LNG terminal.

Metgas  is the only company that has any access to DPC's terminal. As you know, DPC  is owned today by Enron (65), MSEB (15), GE (10) and Bechtel (10). At year  end, Enron's 65 will be split to Enron (50) and new investor (15). Any  changes to the terminal or the TARA have to be approved by DPC, which is  heavily influenced, but not controlled, by Enron.  The real asset that Enron has today is the TARA, and Enron has this through  Metgas. Under the TARA, Metgas has right to have DPC regassify any gas that  Metgas delivers to DPC. In addition, Metgas has rights to increase size of  terminal at its cost. So whoever owns and controls Metgas is who has the real  value here. Today, Metgas is 100% owned and controlled by Enron, so Enron has  control. But in any sale of Metgas, Enron's control will be lessened. Under  current plans to avoid debt consolidation, we will reduce Enron's equity  position to 50% or less, which means we are at best sharing control with  someone else, or maybe a group of someone else's. If Enron is uncomfortable  with this because it views access to Metgas terminal as part of larger LNG  role, we should discuss ASAP.  AG -- please allow time on Wednesday's agenda to discuss these issues with  Rick and Clay.

For fuel  supply, they can supply Nahptha to Dabhol and LNG to Metgas.  They will have  BOD positions pro rata with their ownership.   Finally, in the case of  Dabhol, there are significant minority shareholder protections given the way  the the various voting procedures are designed.  I am not as familiar with  the Metgas voting procedures, but there is certainly the opportunity to  negotiated something there since it is still in development.  Also, there  should be attractive commercial returns with each project.  I feel that these opportunities certainly meets their investment criteria.

Policy on Noncompetition.  I  would appreciate if you would check with your CEO/COO regarding this e-mail  and respond to me by Friday, September 29 if you have questions or concerns.   Enron APACHI may need to commit to the following provisions (that bind Enron  affiliates) by Monday, October 2.  Given the consolidating power generation market in Asia Pacific, Enron Asia  Pacific/Africa/China (Enron APACHI) is proposing to enter into a transaction  with Marubeni and Sithe Asia to combine the respective power generation  portfolios into a single company (Newco).  Newco would be charged with making  the shareholders' investments as liquid as possible to allow for sale of the  shareholders' respective stakes in Newco.    The shareholders believe that Newco must not be seen by the market as a  ""dumping ground"" for existing power projects but rather as the vehicle  through which the investors will continue to pursue power generation  opportunities in Asia.  As a result, Enron APACHI proposes to include  competition restrictions in the Marubeni/Enron Shareholder Agreement that  would bind their respective affiliates.    The following is a summary of these competition provisions:  Enron affiliates (with the exceptions stated below) could only develop or own  power projects in the Asia Pacific Region (as defined below) after first  offering the opportunity to Newco.  If Newco declines the opportunity, Enron  would be free to own the project itself or offer the project to third parties  provided that the terms do not materially improve.  Development or ownership  does not include the provision of construction, O&M, offtaker or risk  management services.  There are a number of exceptions to this rule:  (a) small projects involving  20 MW or less; (b) projects in which Enron owns less than a 1/3 interest; (c)  projects initiated by our SK joint venture; (d) Korean projects using natural  gas produced by Enron; (e) projects obtained in a corporate acquisition in  which Asia generation is less than 20% of the value of the acquisition; and  (f) situations in which any Enron company would be exposed to fiduciary  liability to another shareholder in complying with the competition  restriction.  ""Affiliates"" will be defined to exclude Enron affiliates which are  publicly-owned (e.g., Azurix).  ""Asia Pacific Region"" will be defined to include Brunei, China (including  Hong Kong and Macau), South Korea, North Korea, Taiwan, Vietnam, Laos,  Cambodia, Thailand, Myanmar, the Philippines, Malaysia, Indonesia, East  Timor, Singapore, Papua New Guinea and the Pacific Islands (including Guam,  Saipan, the Federated States of Micronesia, and Fiji, but excluding Hawaii).   It does not include Japan and Australia.  The competition clause would survive until the earlier of (a) Enron selling  its interest in Newco or (b) December 31, 2003.

Policy on Noncompetition.  I  would appreciate if you would check with your CEO/COO regarding this e-mail  and respond to me by Friday, September 29 if you have questions or concerns.   Enron APACHI may need to commit to the following provisions (that bind Enron  affiliates) by Monday, October 2.  Given the consolidating power generation market in Asia Pacific, Enron Asia  Pacific/Africa/China (Enron APACHI) is proposing to enter into a transaction  with Marubeni and Sithe Asia to combine the respective power generation  portfolios into a single company (Newco).  Newco would be charged with making  the shareholders' investments as liquid as possible to allow for sale of the  shareholders' respective stakes in Newco.    The shareholders believe that Newco must not be seen by the market as a  ""dumping ground"" for existing power projects but rather as the vehicle  through which the investors will continue to pursue power generation  opportunities in Asia.  As a result, Enron APACHI proposes to include  competition restrictions in the Marubeni/Enron Shareholder Agreement that  would bind their respective affiliates.    The following is a summary of these competition provisions:  Enron affiliates (with the exceptions stated below) could only develop or own  power projects in the Asia Pacific Region (as defined below) after first  offering the opportunity to Newco.  If Newco declines the opportunity, Enron  would be free to own the project itself or offer the project to third parties  provided that the terms do not materially improve.  Development or ownership  does not include the provision of construction, O&M, offtaker or risk  management services.  There are a number of exceptions to this rule:  (a) small projects involving  20 MW or less; (b) projects in which Enron owns less than a 1/3 interest; (c)  projects initiated by our SK joint venture; (d) Korean projects using natural  gas produced by Enron; (e) projects obtained in a corporate acquisition in  which Asia generation is less than 20% of the value of the acquisition; and  (f) situations in which any Enron company would be exposed to fiduciary  liability to another shareholder in complying with the competition  restriction.  ""Affiliates"" will be defined to exclude Enron affiliates which are  publicly-owned (e.g., Azurix).  ""Asia Pacific Region"" will be defined to include Brunei, China (including  Hong Kong and Macau), South Korea, North Korea, Taiwan, Vietnam, Laos,  Cambodia, Thailand, Myanmar, the Philippines, Malaysia, Indonesia, East  Timor, Singapore, Papua New Guinea and the Pacific Islands (including Guam,  Saipan, the Federated States of Micronesia, and Fiji, but excluding Hawaii).   It does not include Japan and Australia.  The competition clause would survive until the earlier of (a) Enron selling  its interest in Newco or (b) December 31, 2003.

"Sally,  Thanks for the email and update.  I agree that we must do something quickly  to resolve this.  I believe that you should interview for summer interns as  an extension to your upcoming planned recruiting trip.  I know you were very  happy with the summer interns from the energy management program at OU that  you got last year ( I was surprised and the school was thrilled  that you  offered all 5 permanent positions upon graduation).   We cant lose that  momentum.  I am sure that each school's program is different and that most  don't interview for summer interns this early in the year but from what I  have learned about the OU schedule, we will lose all the top candidates if we  wait.  I am sure that is not what Charlene and Celeste were trying to  accomplish with their guidelines.  Please keep me up informed on this matter.  Thanks and good luck with the students.  mike        Enron North America Corp.    From:  Sally Beck                           10/02/2000 07:13 PM    To: Charlene Jackson/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Celeste Roberts/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: Richard Causey/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Mike McConnell/HOU/ECT@ECT  Subject: Hiring Practices for Summer Interns   While recruiting on campus recently I became aware that a decision was made  at the Program level to not interview this fall for 2001 summer interns.  In  talking with students and faculty at The University of Texas and University  of Oklahoma, it became clear that there is concern over the feasibility of an  internship with Enron, as other top firms will be recruiting this fall for  summer 2001 interns.  I have communicated my concerns to Lexi Elliott and her  manager, Shelley Jones, and was told by both that the decision to delay  interviews for summer interns was made at a Program level based on Enron's  staffing.  When I asked about the competitive data available regarding the  practice of other firms on summer intern interviews, I was even more  concerned to discover that neither Lexi nor Shelley had that data.  It would  seem critical to know what the competition is doing in terms of summer intern  interview schedules in order to understand the risk that could be created for  Enron by not interviewing this fall for these important feeder positions for  our Analyst and Associates programs.    I have had conversations over the last two weeks with Lexi and Shelley, with  no resolution.  When they could not provide the competitive data to either  confirm or eliminate my concerns, I volunteered to have James Scribner, a   Senior Director on my team, obtain this market information.  Lexi and Shelley  either did not have the time to gather this data, or were not sure how to do  so.  They were pleased to have some help in getting our hands on this  critical information.  I now have information at hand with regard to firms  that will be recruiting at UT and OU this fall for summer intern positions.    And based on this information, I believe that Enron is at risk for not hiring  top students as interns for the summer of 2001 if we do not interview for  these positions this fall.    While my research only touches on two of the schools at which Enron recruits,  I want to raise concern over this as a potential problem at many, if not all  campuses that we have targeted for recruiting.    As administrators of the  program, you rely on the involvement of senior members of the company to  carry the Enron message to campus.  I believe that we also have an obligation  to make this a two-way messaging system.  I strongly believe that we must  address this potential risk for Enron extremely quickly, as teams will be on  campuses across the country to conduct interviews in a matter of days.  I  suspect that many Enron participants in the recruiting process are unaware of  the Program's decision regarding the timing of interviews for summer  internships.  In working with Rick Causey and Mike McConnell, executive  sponsors for UT and OU, respectively, they are as concerned as I about the  decision on interviewing summer interns.  I have copied both of them on this  note to the two of you.   Please let me know how this can be resolved.  With the help of James Scribner  and others, we have already compiled a list of students at UT and OU that  should be targeted for summer internships.  I will offer as much of my time  as is feasible to work with staff members of the Program to devise creative  ways to turn this around.

Main cause is the fuel crisis in Europe, particularly in Spain,  where  combination of prices kept low under government pressure, and blockade of  terminals by strikers, have cut  the cash flow of GM,  putting into peril the  above plan;  and this is worsened by the attitude of the owner, who seems to  be unable to face the situation. He is now stopping his management effort to  sell the company,  which was the only viable solution;  the company being  unable financially to sustain the burden of carrying the strategic   inventories, a direct consequence of the increase of the trading volume in  the early 2000.    As a reminder, we have 20 million USD of strategic inventories in the name  (and paper control) of ECTRIC Spain. We need however to urgently get 3 more  documents  to have paper  title/possession of these, with always the risk  that a Spanish liquidator contest our position. We could initiate the sale of these inventories, however as they are used by  GM in their strategic inventory figure, we immediately make GM unable to  continue their operations, as they will loose their operating licence and  stop payments...  GM general manager was here today, he was asking if Enron could step in and  save the company ;  however,  it doesnot seem to be possible without  increasing our exposure, which we have no appetite for..  We are going to meet asap GM President to put all possible pressure on him to  accept to sell the company to a third party (Tamoil/BP are  potential  buyers), and sign the few documents missing, giving us full control of ECTRIC  Spain. We will then monitor situation on a daily basis;  fear that we will be  in a difficult corner if Spanish conflict is not ending, and if company  cannot get sold.

I do not intend to circulate outside HR other than  to then 7 of you, Cindy O and the other HR leads. This essentially reflects  what I hope you already know that your HR lead support is:  ENA - Me with Sheila Knudsen (I ultimately hope Cindy Skinner will move to  take this lead sometime next year). EGM - Cindy Skinner and Shanna Funkhouser (We believe Shanna will develop to  lead this in the next 12 months) EIM - Me and Fran Mayes (the plan would be for Fran to eventually take lead  on this when she is ready).   Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns.  David  ****************************************************************************** *************************************************************************  TO: ALL ENA HR CC: Olson, Delainey, Lavorato, Frevert, McMahon, Bowen, McConnell, Shankman,  R. Jones, M.Barnard, M.Joyce, D.Lynch, B.VanCleve From: Oxley  Western Hemisphere Wholesale Energy HR Group Organisation Change  When we launched our HR Franchise Team structure in February this year we did  so with the commitment to continually refine and challenge ourselves to  ensure we were optimising the resources we have available to help our  businesses achieve and exceed their goals. In fact you will recall in  communicating the changes in February, we actually highlighted what we  anticipated would be a need to make further refinements and changes to  maximise our effectiveness.  A great deal has happened in these last 6 months and I am delighted that the  Franchise team concept has contributed so much towards our far greater  partnership with our individual business groups and our own outlook,  priorities and objectives. We truly have revolutionised how we provide HR  services and advice. More importantly, the business has recognised us for the  huge progress we have made to date. This success is an outstanding  achievement and one that I hope you join me in being extremely proud of.  As is always the case at Enron, continuous change is the norm and so as to  illustrate this point quite effectively the businesses previously part of ENA  have over the last 2 months, essentially been split into three: Enron Global  Markets, set up to focus on the Global Fuels markets which were previously  part of Enron Europe and CALME,  Coal, Financial Tarding and  Insurance/Weather which were all previously part of ENA. EGM is now led by  Mike McConnell and Jeff Shankman. Enron Industrial Markets, set up to focus  on the Industrial markets and expand our activities across new Industrial  sectors which will build on the success of the Paper, Pulp and Lumber  business previously part of ENA and immediately develop a steel market. EIM  is led by Jeff McMahon and Ray Bowen. Enron North America remains the largest  of these three businesses even after these changes and will now focus all of  its efforts on the highly successful Gas and Power markets in North America,  including Canada and Mexico. ENA continues to be led by Dave Delainey and  John Lavorato. Mark Frevert, following his return from Europe, has been  instrumental in the restructuring of these businesses and is Chairman of each  of these as well as Enron Europe, which collectively now constitute Enron's  entire activities in the Wholesale commodity markets.  These changes in the businesses we support clearly force us to re-examine the  HR business model and adjust our strategy accordingly. Fortunately, our  flexible organisation structure lends itself extremely well to realign along  these new business lines and as such the changes illustrated below in the  attached org chart are far easier for us to make than they might otherwise  have been. In addition, given the immense value and positive client feedback  we have received on our efforts to concentrate our HR resources on Franchise  skill lines, this also provides us with an opportunity to reinforce and  refine our efforts in developing market intelligence, employment  propositions, compensation ideas and best practices, as well as the  innovatively sourced talent pipelines in each of these areas to pro-actively  provide our clients with a competitive advantage.  I believe the changes outlined on the attached org chart are self  explanatory, however if you have any questions please feel free to raise them  either with your team leads or me. Given that we have a staff meeting  scheduled for Friday I would plan to walk through these changes with you and  answer any questions at that time.  Finally, to reinforce our goals and prepare you all for the next 6 months, I  would like to underline the overall commitment to continue to change and flex  our resources to anticipate, meet and exceed our businesses needs. This will  clearly mean further organisation changes as we move forward. This is not  Change for change's sake, but change, and our ability to change quickly and  as often as necessary, is essential for us to remain a competitive and  effective HR resource for our clients.

For example,= =20 Harvard does not allow an organization to come on campus and speak to first= =20 year students until January.  As indicated, the firms that generally recrui= t=20 in the fall are the Accounting firms and they are primarily recruiting for= =20 ""spring"" internships.  The recruiting strategy at Enron is no different this year than it was last= =20 year with respect to summer interns.   Presentations were made in January &= =20 February and offers were made in February and March.  The only school that= =20 did not follow the normal process was OU under the direction of George Hope= . =20 We did, of course, recruit summer interns in the fall for the tax group=20 because they are competing directly with the Accounting Firms.  Utilizing this strategy did not impair Enron=01,s ability to hire quality s= ummer=20 interns.  This past summer Enron had 76 summer Analysts (undergraduate) and= =20 40 summer Associates (graduate).  We intentionally limited the number of=20 summer hires to ensure that the individuals hired received meaningful=20 assignments.  Approximately 85% of these individuals received permanent=20 offers to join Enron.  =20  The reason Enron has not had a problem recruiting quality undergraduate=20 summer interns is primarily because many organizations do not hire=20 undergraduates for summer positions.  They generally focus on MBAs,=20 particularly the investment banks and consulting firms which are the firms= =20 that Jeff Skilling identifies as Enron's competitors.  Because the=20 undergraduates are not actively recruited by our competition we have=20 continued to have a special focus on these individuals (i.e. the reason the= re=20 were 76 undergraduates and only 40 MBAs).  With respect to OU and UT specifically since those were the schools about= =20 which you raised a concern, let me address your concerns.  In your e-mail y= ou=20 indicated that you had research conducted at UT and OU.  You did not howeve= r,=20 provide the results of the research or the person to whom they had spoken= =20 therefore I had Lexi Elliott contact both UT and OU.  While OU has not gotten back to her, following is the information obtained= =20 from UT.  o The contact at UT Career Services is Cindy Henson. =20 o According to Cindy, approximately 5% of companies actively recruiting on= =20 campus conduct interviews in the fall for ""summer"" internships.  Cindy=20 attributes  this to the fact that these companies cannot come in the spring= ,=20 or, in the case of Andersen Consulting, have a tremendous need and conduct= =20 all interviews  at one time. =20 o In conclusion, Cindy estimated that 95% of companies actively recruiting = on=20 campus recruit in the spring for summer internships.  We have not received information from OU therefore I am unable to provide t= he=20 statistics at this time.  I will provide as soon as I am in receipt of such= =20 information. =20  It appears that the information your source obtained is considerably=20 different than what we were told.  If you would provide the name of the=20 individual to whom they spoke I will follow up to determine the reason for= =20 the discrepancies.  While I understand your concern with respect to OU, they appear to be=20 different than most of the other schools at which we recruit.  If you belie= ve=20 that it is critical to recruit summer interns at OU in the fall we are=20 supportive; however, because Lexi has other school interviews that are=20 already scheduled she will not be in a position to facilitate the interview= =20 process during the trip you have scheduled currently.  As you are aware, in= =20 most instances, the dates for presentations and interviews are dictated by= =20 the respective universities and were secured in early August. If you would= =20 like for her to try and secure an interview schedule for a later date this= =20 fall she can certainly work with your schedule and her current schedule to= =20 support your efforts.  I hope this has been helpful.  I can understand and appreciate your=20 frustration if you are not getting answers from the recruiter or her=20 manager.

"Gary,  Thanks for the email.  Here is my attempt to type out a response.  I hope it  helps.  1.  It was a matrix organization.  The IT personnel reported into the Global  Tech. group but we did that for communication and consistency  purposes  rather than simply control.  They attended business unit staff meetings and  the BU had a great influence in the review process and gave constant  feedback.  It was vitally important for the ""customer"" to be happy and that  the IT person completed the projects from the BU.  When it came to the review  process itself, GT ranked all the employees and peers but the business unit  had the greatest influence on where the person actually ranked and was rated.  2.  When Enron Net Works was formed, nothing really changed on the day to day  working of the IT world.  IT (Global Technology) was folded into the newly  created 5th business unit at Enron.  Remember Global Technology had more that  IT alone.  We had an eCommerce commercial group, a principal investments  group and was developing eCommerce or Technology origination roles developing  around the world.  Philippe Bibi is the CTO for Enron and Enron Net Works.  He is in the office  of the chairman of ENW with Greg Whalley, CEO and Louise Kitchen, the newly  appointed COO.  Both LK and GW are non IT people.  There are many VPs on the  next level that are IT executives.  3.  In a nut shell, Scott grinned when I told him of my 2 weeks experience  and title as CEO with Enron's goal of becoming the largest B2B player in the  world.  He chuckled and said something like, ""That sounds like Enron, it  always looks at things differently.  He then stated that my CEO title and  Enron's approach was very unusual but that it would be more common place  soon,  as this was the way of the future and Enron was the first to recognize  it and change its culture"".  4.  When i used the word cannibalize, I meant that if we didn't change the  business ourselves, than our competition would do this for us.  For example,  we were the leading trader of natural gas in the US by far but we initiated  EnronOnline and completely changed the way we traded natural gas and did it  for free.  Thus we cannibalized our own successful business even when it was  going great.  We are looking at all of our businesses for changes like that.  Gary, I hoped that helped.  Please don't hesitate to contact me if you have  any other questions.

They are good background. And thanks so much for meeting with Julia and me this week. It was most  interesting and helpful. I'm confused on a couple of points, so would you mind answering a few more questions?  1. You said that after Enron created the Global Technology group, you ""seeded people out into the business units, and the way we did that is we had those people be totally accountable both to us and to the business unit head."" So,  at that point it was a sort of matrix organization, with IT people dispersed thoughout the business units but at the same time accountable to a central IT organization for things such as standards, is that correct?  2. Then, this spring when Net Works was formed, did those 1,500 IT people essentially leave the business units to join a more traditional IT  organization? Roughly how many non-IT people, and of what types, are part of Net Works? Two  of the three top managers in Net Works are non-IT (from trading), correct? Does  any given IT person now still live in a matrix world with responsibilities to IT  and to a business unit?  3. For some reason, my recorder messed up and I couldn't decipher what you  said about Scott McNealy's reaction to your background, etc. at the breakfast.  Could you repeat that?  4. You said: ""We had to cannibalize our own businesses. So what I think you'll see five years from now is that the IT world will look totally different.""  What did you mean by ""cannibalize our own business""?.  Thanks again.  Regards, Gary Anthes  Gary H.

"Gary,  There were two such events.  On the Scott McNelly side, I realized that we  weren't too late to change our approach and take a commercial view on  technology.  None of the other companies were thinking our new way at all  plus when someone of the caliber and reputation of McNelly gives you a  general approval and confirmation, as a new guy, that meant a lot.  It  inspired me to keep going on a ""nontraditional"" path.  The other big  impact  moment was listening and having a brief conversation with John Chambers of  Cisco.  It was at the eCommerce Summit in Washington DC and he gave his, ""its  a matter of survival"" speech.  That really hit me and our conversation was  also similar about my new job and Enron's new approach.  He gave me a  positive response and also gave me some advice that included an observation  that the incumbent IT people may not have the abilities to help me lead Enron  in the eCommerce world.  It was going to take a different kind of  technologist.  That moment had the most impact on me of the two.   I saw John  again and spoke with him at an Economist  conference in Laguna Nigel and told  him of his original impact and I think he appreciated the story.  He also was  very nice to give me some time to talk after that speech as well.  I hope that clarified things,  good luck with the piece.

As I expressed in our recent  telephone conversation,  I view Metgas as a key asset that could be of great  value to the EGM LNG network.  I believe that Enron should reconsider whether  or not a Metgas selldown is a wise move at this time for the following  reasons:    1.  The Dabhol LNG terminal is ideally located for future LNG arbitrage  plays, i.e., halfway between middle east and far east LNG suppliers.   Opportunites for Mideast/Far East swaps or shipping backhauls could generate  significant value for EGM.  2.  Metgas currently holds exclusive rights to use Dabhol's LNG terminal for  imports of LNG into India, and it will be at least several years (if ever)  before a second LNG terminal is built in India.  We should not be giving this  strategic position away.  3.  The fact that our competitors (e.g., Petronas, BP, BG etc.) want to buy  in is an indicator that we have something of value.  Even a partial selldown  (and granting of voting rights) to one of these players could serously  compromise our optionality and ability to maximize value to Enron.   4. I suspect that the market value of Metgas at this time (given that there  is still significant developement risk) is fairly small relative to its  network value to EGM.   If, in spite of my arguments, a decison is made to sell down Metgas, there  are two things that we could do to limit the damage:  1.  Prior to the sale, sign an agreement between EGM and Metgas that provides  EGM with exclusive rights to use the terminal, and  2.  EGM should step into the Metgas/Malaysia LNG contract (i.e., EGM should  buy from Malaysia and resell to Metgas) to ensure that we maintain maximum  optionality in this contract.  We could do this in a way that gives us  control of the contract but passes Metgas risk through EGM and back to  Malaysia.  I understand that the time fuse for this selldown is very short---immediate  action is needed if you want a vote on this.

The partners will build a natural-gas-fired power station whose 500-megawatt capacity will represent 30 percent of the country's current electricity demand, said Fenosa in a note, confirmed with the company.      The generator will run on liquefied natural gas when it starts operating in 2002, switching to fuel from the re- gasification plant when it starts operating in 2003.      Fenosa has had an alliance with International Power Plc, formerly National Power Plc, since 1998. That alliance focuses on Europe, the U.S. and Australia, a Fenosa spokeswoman said today.      Enron was the first U.S. utility to receive licenses to buy, sell and import electricity in Spain, after the government started opening energy markets to competition in 1998. It's also licensed to market natural gas.      The Texas-based utility is building a gas-fired power plant in southern Spain, has a wind turbine factory near Toledo, and plans another windmill factory in Catalonia.  --Brooke Nelson in the Madrid bureau (34 91) 700-9600 or b.nelson@bloomberg.net   /ph  Story illustration: UNF SM <Equity> COMP D to chart Fenosa's performance against the IBEX index.

In a release, Fenosa said the deal involves the construction of a combined-cycle power plant with a 500MW potency, which will use natural gas from a regasification plant on the island nation.   The 500MW potency is equivalent to 30% of the Caribbean island's electricity demand.   The deal also includes a complimentary project, Fenosa said. This is the construction of a regasification plant on the republic's coastline, with a capacity for treating gas equivalent to the consumption of various groups of combined-cycle plants with a potency of 1300MW.   The investment for these two projects is seen at around $550 million, of which $100 million could come from Dominican companies, Fenosa said.   Fenosa and Enron estimate that construction of the two projects will begin  in early 2001, with the power plant coming online in 2002. It will operate with combustible liquid until 2003, at which time the regasification plant comes online.

"Erin, here are a couple of responses.  Please rewrite as you see fit.   Mike  1. Agriculture.    We are currently looking at and studying the industry.  We  have traded some commodities as well.  We believe that there may be large  opportunities to apply the Enron model to the agriculture industry.  We have  spent quite a bit of time an effort and are currently developing our  strategy.  This is very early in development but we have high expectations in  this area.  I don't feel comfortable going into more detail at this time.   Gary Hickerson is responsible Enron's ag business.  2.  Rail.  We are looking at numerous opportunities in the rail and  transportation businesses.  I haven't seen a lot on the electricity piece of  rail.

We discussed this last week and I thought the  consensus was to slow this process down and exclude partners who could impede  our strategic global LNG interests -- for example Petronas and BP Amoco.   I  now understand that we are making presentatations on the equity sale to  potential investors next week in Singapore (BP, Petronas, CEPA, Mitsubishi,  etc).     I don't like the notion that we must disclose our TIGA to SPA to potential  investors.  There are several aspects of that SPA which gives us strategic  advantage over other competitors - for example the diversion clause of 0.5  MMTA.  I like even less the thought that one of our partners will see the  Master Supply Agreement (MSA) to MetGas.  Once a competitor sees the MSA they  will have some insight on how to undermine our supply aggregation efforts and  how Enron manages its Global LNG risk book.  This is a serious concern and we  must ensure that it doesn't happen -- first by exclusion and then by  negotiation (i.e. in the shareholders agreement we don't give investors with  less than 10% equity the right to see contracts -- by the way Petronas does  this routinely with its partners in MLNG TIGA).

There is no  forward Panama Parity market, but we have been able to produce a forward  curve by updating the historical PP prices. This process helps the Panama  City office be able to deal with the local regulators and get dispatched  more.  2) Ecoelectrica in Puerto Rico called and needed historical NYMEX NX3 natural  gas prices back to 1993 due to a dispute with their power purchaser because  their contract is poorly written. Knowledge of these numbers will help them  make a better case with their customer.  3) The Buenos Aires office called and needed help with their EOL rollout and  hedge prices tied to NYMEX crude for a crude producer in Argentina. 4) The Guatemala office (PQPC) called with a sulfur issue on the latest cargo  delivery. This lead to numerous discussions with the independent inspectors  and fuel supplier. The issue is of particular importance at PQPC because of  the recent financing of the project and the scrutiny regarding the emissions  at the plant.  5) Mariella Mahan's group called looking for help on physical and financial  resid into Nicaragua regarding their bid/negotiation with ENEL on the  privatization of some power plants in Nicaragua. The plants currently buy  from Esso and we hope to improve their fuel prices by up to a $1/barrel. That  would create an annual savings of over $1.5MM per year. This involved a  lengthy conference call, existing contract review and several forward curves. 6) The weather group was looking for historical propane prices for a new  product to be offered to Conoco. 7) The San Paulo office called looking for a twenty year forward curve for  crude and three grades of resid to help them with an LDC project them  operate.  8) The Metgas office in India called looking for a one year naphtha hedge  tied to crude.  9) ENA called to talk about using jet fuel instead of low sulfur diesel in a  proposed peaker in Florida. I went through a cost/benefit analysis with them  and they went back to using the LS diesel curve for the project.  10) Rob Bradley called looking for help with the Enron Washington, DC office  who was fighting off a challenge from the NYMEX who wants EOL regulated like  an exchange. We were able to provide Chris Long numerical data that helped  Enron's case and ultimately Enron got the initial ruling they were looking  for.   All of the above were in addition to our normal daily duties (battles) with  the five EI power plants and their fuel deliveries, along with the new  business ventures we are involved in. If you want specific big money savings  for other Enron entities or projects I would refer you to the previous memos  I have sent you regarding India, Guatemala and Panama which exceeded $20MM.  Hopefully, the daily requests that we service for other Enron groups leads to  better projects with better actual returns and less overall problems.   If you need additional information I would be glad to provide it. ",jeffrey.shankman@enron.com,mike.mcconnell@enron.com,Re: follow-up to EBR,2000-10-18 03:10:00-07:00,sent

Specifically,  Enron  Energy Services' (EES) business has grown dramatically and that requires  considerable additional engineering and construction resources both to  develop solutions for customers and to deliver those solutions to customers.   Additionally, in light of Enron's continued emphasis on increasing our return  on invested capital, we have been engaged in fewer large scale construction  projects around the world.  Historically, these projects have been a primary  focus of EECC's activities.  Consequently we are making the following  organizational changes concerning EECC:  EECC's pipeline construction group, led by Jerry Martin, will become part of  Enron Transportation Services.   NEPCO will continue to operate as a stand alone entity focused on power plant  construction services to Enron entities and third parties. The remainder of EECC will become part of EES.  Larry Izzo will report to the  EES Office of the Chairman.    These changes will better align our intellectual capital with the growth  opportunities within Enron and provide new and exciting opportunities for our  employees.

Wade Cline and Tim Det. are both  high on him.  Jeff Donahue is not so sure but will meet with him on Friday.   During my lunch with Jeff, we discussed that we need a Corp. Dev guy  dedicated to us full time but if he reported to him, that would be great.  I  think we could use that co-ordination with his group as long as we didn't get  a part time guy in the process.  He could also report to us obviously (like  Larry) but i think in this case a dual role makes a  lot of sense.  What do  you think?  If you like Don, he could be an immediate candidate to start doing our Corp  Dev work, but that is of course not the best reason.  I thought he was all  right and he did have a good understanding of our products and is an  innovative thinker.  He has also worked as a trader and although it doesn't  seem possible by his personality, having some background is a plus.

"Gary,  1.  Correct 2.  Global tech drove and directed the PRC (performance review committee) for  all of it's employees.  Enron ranks all of it's employees 2 times a year.   The employees are examined and given feedback on their performance.  It is a  very lengthy process but it is very fair and insures and identifies excellent  performance.  The criteria for the rankings comes from a person's  accomplishments, characteristics and customer feedback from numerous  sources.  It is all on computer and when we discuss a persons performance and  ranking, that feedback (primarily from the business unit) is a key driver.   Plus, there are business unit reps on the PRC. 3.  I guess the way i would describe it would be that on every major  expenditure and project, the commercial people involved helped drive the  process as well as our group looking at it the same way.  An example would be  that traditionally any IT group or technologist is in love this the latest  and greatest technology.  and could look at embedding a new system in the  company because it is the latest technology and is very cool.   I would ask  what commercial function does it perform and how does it give us a  competitive advantage.  It was a very customer driven (internal and external  customers) process.  It was also a mind set and paradigm shift internally  within the group because they started looking at themselves adding to the  bottom line rather than simply a cost center.  I hope that helps.

Although we have less than two weeks  left, we still have several exciting fundraising activities taking place.   All walkers should continue getting pledges and watch for further  instructions on turning in the walk forms.  Everyone has done an incredible  job this year.  Great news, we are getting very close to reaching our goal,  but if we want to continue to be the number one walk team in Houston, we need  to continue with our fundraising efforts.  Please plan to join us for the  following activities this week:   Silent/Cyber Auction - The JDF Silent Cyber Auction will open for bids on  Wednesday, October 25th, at 8:00 a.m. and will close on Thursday, October  26th, at 4:00 p.m.  You may access the Cyber Auction to place your bids at  8:00 a.m. on Wednesday, October 25th, by launching the website at  http://ecinside.enron.net/apps/jdf.nsf  or go to the Enron home page on the  Intranet and click on the JDF Cyber Auction.  For more information, contact  Sophie Patel at ext. 35055 or Eddie Sera at ext. 30480.    Bake Sale and Raffles - Just in time for the Holidays!  On Friday, October  27th, we will have several groups selling delicious baked goods on the second  floor level of the Enron Building outside the Energizer.  In addition, we  will have representatives from some of our walk teams available for the  purchase of raffle tickets at the same location.  For all that are not signed up, please join us in the walk.  You still have  time.  It will take 2 minutes to fill out a walk form, you get a great  Enron/JDF T-shirt for collecting or donating $25 or more, and will join  hundreds of Enron employees and approximately 10,000 Houstonians for the walk  on Sunday, November 5th, at the Sam Houston Race Park.  I promise this will  be a blast.  The Enron tent will be great again this year!  We will begin  with a continental breakfast prior to the walk and when everyone returns from  the walk we will have music, balloons for the children and wonderful Frankie  Mandola's hamburgers, hot dogs and fries.  Parking at the Sam Houston Race  Park is free.  You will be part of something very worthwhile and it will make  you feel great.  This is a world class event.  Please contact any of the following Steering Committee members to make a  donation, sign up as a walker, or ask any questions you may have.  Come join  the fun.

This year's  offsite has been scheduled for 20/21 November at the woodlands.  We picked  these dates and reserved (and paid for) the Woodlands earlier this year  because almost all members of the worldwide LNG team will be in the US at  this time for either the San Antonio conference or Gastech.  Given the recent reorganization and changes in Enron's international  direction, I feel that this meeting is more vital than usual.  I assume that some members of the group will want to take vacation later in  the week because of Thanksgiving---therefore, I plan to compress the offsite  into a one-day meeting on 20 November and leave 21 Nov for ad-hoc team  meetings and/or golf for those who want to stay another day.  This would be a perfect opportunity to educate the entire team on ""mark to  market"" mechanics, the LNG ""book"", enron online and any other similar topics  that may be appropriate.

As flattered as I  am, I believe that our current Chief Technology Officer, Philippe Bibi, is  more appropriate as a nominee from Enron.

In August I was asked to take on  another assignment as CEO of Enron Global Markets.  Although this was an even  more challenging position I will say that it was a tough decision to leave  the technology world.

We discussed the subjects of Enron looking at the purchase  of GATX Terminals Corporation and the hiring of an individual from GATX  Terminals.  As I mentioned earlier, I know an individual who has worked for GATX  approximately 20 years in several capacities who is interested in joining the  Enron team.  His name is Steve Denney and he resides in Chicago, IL.  He  travels each week to Houston for his current job as President of GAXT  Products Services (GPS).  Capacities within the GATX organization that Steve  has held include:  President of GATX Products Services (GPS) Executive Vice President Domestic Sales and Marking for GATX Terminals Southern Region Business Unit Manager (Texas, Louisiana, and Florida) for  GATX Terminals General Manager of Calnev Pipe Line Company (a subsidiary of GATX Terminals)  I have worked with Steve in different capacities since 1991, and think he  would be a GREAT asset to the Enron organization.  I would like to introduce  the two of you to see if there is a fit for Steve within our company.  You  expressed interest earlier today when we talked.  If you are still  interested, could you please advise me on what steps to take from here?  I appreciate your time in considering Steve as an employee and look forward  to pursuing him as an Enron team member.

He  joined us around the middle of the year, so we did not have much data when we  conducted our mid-year review.  He is an entrepreneur with strengths in logistics and systems.  He has both  technical and commercial backgrounds.  During this year, he used is background in logistics and management to  identify $1.8MM in recurring annual savings for Ventane, one of Enron's  businesses in Venezuela.  I had initially placed him with Dan Reck because of Antonio's background in  logistics.  However, it appears that Dan is more interested in bringing on  people with a background in trading, which is not Antonio's strength.  I encourage you to closely examine his resume and I appreciate any good ideas.  I'm also looking forward to getting together with you soon.  Many thanks.

As we discussed, I am attaching a brief introduction to Nexstar Financial and a copy of our latest press release. Nexstar is a financial services company that is currently offering mortgage lending products. We began the company in May 1999 and have spent the last 18 months building a state of the art high tech (web) high touch (telephone) customer communication/service center located in St. Louis Missouri.. We specialize in working with Fortune 500 companies to provide superior mortgage products to their relocating employees as well as to their  general employee population.   Our management team of industry leaders launched Nexstar after holding senior positions with some of the most prominent mortgage companies in the business today. Our Chairman, Marvin Moskowitz was Chairman of the parent company of Prudential Home Mortgage while it grew to industry prominence in  providing mortgage products to corporate America.  Rick Thornberry, our CEO and President, most recently held the COO and President positions at Citi Mortgage.  I serve as Managing Director of Business Development at Nexstar and served as Managing Director of Sales at Citi Mortgage responsible for the Corporate Relocation and Employee Program. Previous to Citi I served in several executive positions with Prudential Home Mortgage.  Helen Garrity is Managing Director of Sales and Marketing. She joined Nexstar from her position as SVP of Norwest Mortgage, where she led the corporate and affinity mortgage programs.  Our experienced and visionary management team has been joined by some of the brightest individuals in the mortgage industry.  Since May 1999, our collective team has succeeded in designing and implementing the most advanced mortgage program available to corporations and co-brand partners today, resulting in an easier mortgage process with reduced customer expenses and savings to the corporation.   I'd love to have the opportunity to meet with the appropriate people at Enron to demonstrate the benefits Nexstar offers for Enron's relocating and general employee population.   Please give me a call at your earliest convenience to discuss Nexstar and how we could bring value to Enron.

Plan is for Mike to  get an answer from Siemens (probably this week or next) on spec.  If Siemens  amenable to relax First Gas' spec to plant, request First Gas to relax it's  spec to us.  Mike will report to you as soon as he has heard from Siemens.    If either Siemens or First Gas recalcitrant, move to litigation strategy.   This would mean at next cargo delivery (due mid-November):  (1)  if cargo  ""off spec"" demand separate test using ""ashing"" technique (more likely to  pass) and if it passes using ""ashing"" declare on spec and arbitrate dispute  over acceptance of ""ashing"" as industry standard; (2) if cargo rejected  (either because First Gas refuses to accept ""ashing"" or because off spec even  with ""ashing"") resale cargo and force First Gas to locate alternative  supplies; dispute First Gas invoice for cost of cover.   Mike mentioned a  possible dispute over storage which could also arise with the next delivery.   This could bring us into a dispute with First Gas even if the cargo is on  spec.  Our plan is to get back to you in any event next week when you return with a  status report.  Please let me know if you have any questions.  Cheers.  And congratulations on the Sooners' win.

The goal since March 2000 has been to reduce our credit exposure to GM,  taking into account that a too forceful action would have killed the company  and transform our exposure into a straight loss. We decided a specific course of action, splitting the unsecured exposure  (product already delivered), from the financing of strategic inventories,  without which GM cannot operate.   For the first part(unsecured exposure), it couldnot be a straight downhill  run, because the company needed regular supply to keep its customers, so we  worked a -stair- plan bringing this exposure today to USD 14.5 million, with  a 9.9 million payment October 31st and a last instalment of  4.6 million by  end november. We are not delivering any more product directly to GM but use ECTRIC Spain  (ESSL), or pre-payment. The use of ESSL being not practical for the rack  customer(bottom barrel retail customers), we insist on prepayment for those,  and use ESSL for Kuwait Petroleum Corp and Continental, practically no credit  risk customers. It must be kept in mind that this pre-payment policy ,may at  one stage or another, dry up GM treasury to a point where they will not be  able to repay fully the agreed instalments, especially the end october one.So  it is a choice between getting the -old- debt repaid first, but give shorter  terms of credit for new deliveries, say usd 3 million per 10 days period or  so.    For the second (strategic inventories), we estimated that the best strategy  would be to have these inventories (93.000 mt : book value usd  20.6 million) in a vehicle we have some control on. We decided on the already existing  ESSL, however ESSL could not handle commercial operations without an  operating licence in Spain, and we  got it in June, thanks to GM strong  efforts. ESSL is 50/50 Joint Venture company in which each paid their share  of Equity, however the 42.500 metric tons GM share inventories have been  financed 100 pct by Enron,and Enron is ""lending"" its 42.500 MT to GM, on an  industry accepted practice of buy/sale monthly contracts. In consequence, we  asked GM to sign a Deed of Transfer of the whole to ESSL, which was done, but  a discrepancy between seller legal entity (Garcia Munte Trading versus Garcia  Munte Petroleos) and the advice from our Spanish lawyers to have this deed  notarized, as well as having direct storage agreements with the terminal, has  delayed sofar the completion of the legal paperwork. We are now putting as a pre requisite before any new agreement to have this  paper work signed.  The main reason to get this additional protection is to  protect Enron interests in case of GM bankrupcy, as there is no clear legal  opinion on the attitude a Spanish judge may have on such a complex case.  It is necessary also to put into the equation that in case of GM bankrupcy,  and in case a judge doesn't consider ESSL title solid enough, meaning we  loose the control of the 93.000 metric tons  (or 42.500),  we have in the  books a total hedge value of usd 6.6 million (difference between today's  market value of usd  295 per metric ton versus original value of usd 225 per  metric ton).  Position today : We had a meeting with GM in London october 23rd, our minutes  of which is enclosed. We received from GM a long proposal for a new  cooperation in Spanish that is being presently translated, at first sight it  seems that this proposal doesn t match our own vision of the meeting.  However, it seems the best strategy is still to avoid to despair GM to the  point they will stop to repay,  and continue to battle for getting documents  in good legal order. This is a narrow path, and all parties need to have a  clear understanding of the parameters involved (hopefully explained above)  before we go to the next meeting.

I can certainly understand that.  I seem to have a l lot of that  on this trip.  I am sitting here on the plane, a little tipsy after a couple  glasses of wine, and my mind turns to you and the kids.   I wish I could be  there now to see the kids all dressed up in their costumes ready to go out  trick or treating.  I bet they look great.  As i sit here and feel a little sorry for myself then i come back to reality  and realize just how lucky we really are.  I turned to Ken Rice at the  ceremony yesterday and said, ""What is an Okie and a boy from Nebraska doing  at a Japanese barrel ceremony with Thomas Foley, former Speaker of the House,  breaking a barrel of saki in front of 300 Japanese executives and TV.

Enron can trade gasoline as a commodity the same as natural gas and  electricity.  The idea is any one can buy an amount of gasoline at a  pre-determined price with a certain premium for an extended period.  Which  means there is an expiration date for the investor or buyer.    When the gasoline price is low, such as last year, people are able to buy a  certain amount of gasoline from Enron,( Enron is to negotiate with gasoline  producer for an amount and certain price (whole sale) that Enron believes  they can sold in a certain period of time through market study and be able to  make the profit), say  3000 gallons regular unleaded and with 10% (the profit  margin to be determined  by Enron) premium.  The buyer will receive a debit  or credit card to be used to purchase the gasoline and  the amount will be  automatically recorded  each time when they fill up the cars until the amount  of pre-purchased gasoline is used up in that period of time (prior to the  expiration date).  The buyers (or customer) can also sell the unused gasoline  back to Enron anytime before the expiration day the same price they bought  from Enron for profit if the market gas price is lower or take a loss if the  market price is higher.   By doing this, Enron creates a market that can  allow customers to short the gasoline when the market is high.    There are many other ways to trade the gasoline. Nevertheless, the potential  market ( if a minimum of 50% household can sign up) is tremendous.  I  sincerely believe that Enron has the capability to make it happen through  existing Enron online e-business. We hope this idea has not been thought out  before for its feasibility.

"Mike, As you know, I have arranged for a meeting on December 6th among the Art Committee and Jeff Skilling.  I feel that you should run this meeting.  I would like to accomplish the following:  1) Discuss our Vision for the collection 2) Introduce Ned and Barry 3) Describe art locations in/outside the buildings 4) Discuss progress made to date and timetable 5) Discuss the process:  To what extent Jeff wants to be part of the decision process going forward (i.e. is he comfortable approving our Vision and having us implement? ...Or does he want veto power on each piece?)  The latter would be cumbersome, and I personally would prefer the former, but we definitely need clarification on this before we can proceed. Questions right now for you: 1)   Would you like to invite Ken to join us in the meeting? 2) Ned cannot make it that day (first available day is Dec. 18th) so should we postpone?  Barry is a ""maybe"".  Remember they are there to help us shape a high quality collection and to make sure that we do not make any purchasing ""mistakes"". 3) I have a first draft of the presentation, when can we meet to discuss it? Following on our last meeting with Gensler, I am assembling a detailed list of potential art locations by floor (including dimensions when possible) so that we have a Master from which to work.  I will run it by Bonnie McCloud and Bill Donovan to assure its accuracy. Lastly, I have asked Bill Viola (the video artist for the work we are considering) to come down to Houston to meet with us and with Gensler to discuss where his piece might fit in the new building.  I have also placed a call  Rob and Gregg at Pelli to let them know that I would like for them to meet with a wonderful up and coming artist (Olafur Eliasson) who would like to propose a ""water piece"" for the circular drive.  You will recall that Pelli would very much like to have a water piece there.  Eliasson is very well respected and innovative: He's created waterfalls that flow ""up"" and wonderful minimal installation pieces that are quite beautiful.  I've asked his gallery to let us know if he could meet with Pelli in Connecticut or in Houston on their next trip. Lastly, Enron has purchased the Alex Katz painting that is currently hanging in 50M.  Please call me so I can brief you on how that happened.  I look forward to hearing from you soon.

That the LNG group will have to  bear all expenses until that time just like EFI had to for liquid fuels.

I am also an MBA  student.  I am currently taking a class in marketing and my group will be  doing a presentation on E-commerce and how it is affecting the way businesses  are marketing to their customers (and even how they decide what customers to  market to).  I came across your powerpoint presentation on the EnronOnline  website and found the information to be extremely relevant and useful to what  we plan on covering.  Would it be possible to get a copy of that presentation  from you?  Also, would you be able to provide more insight on how you feel  the internet has made an impact on the energy industry?  I recently heard  that a couple of other utilities (I believe Duke and Sempra) are also putting  together plans for e-commerce websites.  What are your thoughts on that?  Any insight and information you could provide would be greatly appreciated.

Since that time, we have completed a merger with one of our primary competitors, launched our bulk shipping/e-chartering exchange and now have begun trading on the site.  We currently have support from charterers representing approximately 10% of the global petroleum shipping spot market volume and from ship owners representing approximately 15% of the large tanker fleet.  I saw that Enron announced last month its entry into the freight futures market for bulk petroleum shipping.  Given this event and our marketplace momentum, I thought it may make sense to have a more strategic discussion around possible opportunities between Enron and SeaLogistics.  Please let me know your interest in discussing further a potential joint opportunity.  Best regards,  Brad  W.

Some of these turnkeys, like Venezuela  LNG, we are currently working on but there's some uncertainty in their minds  whether or not we'll be allowed to do the project.  Let me clarify the  current situation.    Lou Pai and I have briefed Jeff Skilling as part of the 2001 budget process  and obtained his approval for EECC to continue with the following role:    EECC will manage Enron's technical and engineering risk for large asset  construction projects.  EECC can perform the Enron turnkeys when we mutually  agree that we have the market price and schedule. EECC will shut down third party work (not related to Enron projects except  for NEPCO and power projects). EECC will leverage its approach to technical engineering and construction  risk management to develop new products and services, for example, lender's  engineering due diligence, etc. EECC will develop an Enron Construction Risk Book for all Enron projects,  including NEPCO.  (This process is underway with the help of Rick Buy's group  and should be completed by mid-December.) EECC will transition NEPCO into our project power company.  I'm beginning  this transition by moving the Enron Brazil projects and their project teams  under the NEPCO umbrella.  However, NEPCO cannot manage the Arcos project in  Spain, which has already begun engineering, and I will grandfather Arcos (and  probably the second project in Spain) inside EECC.  As before, business units can bid for outside prices and schedules.  I think  in that regard nothing has changed.  I would like to continue working with  your teams to continue looking for the best deal for Enron on every project,  whether that's an EECC/NEPCO EPC or an outside EPC.  I think we expect to  manage the outside contractors when a decision is made that the best choice  for a particular project is a third party contractor.  I would like to follow  up and meet with you in due course to answer any other questions.

Anthes (Nov. 20, 2000) Wall Street analysts and oil industry executives were thick  among the legion of skeptics who thought Enron Corp. President and Chief  Operating Officer Jeff Skilling was nuts to launch a Web site for the trading  of natural gas and electricity over the Internet.  That was last November, before EnronOnline locked up more than $120 billion  in transactions in its first few months of operation, quickly establishing  itself as the world's largest e-commerce company. As of Oct. 11, just prior  to Enron's report of its third-quarter earnings, EnronOnline had executed  more than 350,000 transactions, representing a gross value of $183 billion.  Since then, the $40 billion Houston-based energy giant has elbowed its way  into several new diversified markets. And it plans to continue its push into  many more, ranging from railcar cargo space to broadband networking and  data-storage capacity.  In doing so, Enron is turbocharging its transformation from a stodgy,  old-line fuel company to an entirely new kind of business-to-business market  maker, with information technology and an all-out emphasis on  entrepreneurship at the heart of its New Economy operations. Enron has been  so successful in leveraging IT to pioneer new markets that others are trying  to emulate its approach.         First to Market  ""Enron often introduces a product before the competition even senses a market  exists,"" the company says in its latest annual report. A prime example:  online trading of data-network capacity.  Indeed, ""there's a low degree of awareness [among carriers] about the  bandwidth-trading business,"" and Enron is ahead of the game, says Seth Libby,  an analyst at The Yankee Group in Boston.  At present, there are only a handful of network professionals who are aware  of these capacity commoditization plans, says Libby. But not for long,  asserts Enron President?? Jeff Skilling. ""Within five years, the bandwidth  market may be bigger than the gas and electric markets,"" he says. ""So for us,  it could be as big as the rest of our existing energy business."" That's  currently a $35 billion business.  But critics say trading bandwidth is much more complicated than trading gas,  especially for a company with little depth in telecommunications. And critics  add that although carriers stand to benefit from the ability to buy and sell  capacity, they might prefer to do it through some channel that's independent  of the control of a single market maker like Enron.  ""Enron's argument is that its trading capabilities are the differentiator,  and that it need not have deep telecom expertise,"" says Lisa Pierce, an  analyst at Giga Information Group in Stamford, Conn. ""But I'm not convinced  it's that simple. Technology isn't a long-term competitive differentiator.""  Houston-based Enron Broadband Services Inc., formed last year, offers IP  transport on its 15,000-mile fiber-optic network. Enron Broadband Services  also trades - that is, makes a market by buying and selling - network  capacity to and from other data carriers, conducting some of the transactions  on EnronOnline.  Enron Broadband Services also offers content-oriented services, such as a  video-on-demand service it will market with Dallas-based Blockbuster Inc. to  home viewers starting next month.  ""When we started the gas business, they told us we were nuts,"" Skilling says.  ""They said, 'You're going to sell gas but not own production? How does that  work?' Then we did electricity and they said we were nuts again, and even  louder than before. They said this stuff moves at the speed of light; you can  never create a market. Then in telecommunications, they said we were nuts  again.""  Despite its share of skeptics, some experts like Enron's prospects in this  space. ""I think aspects of this have the potential to be very big,"" says  Libby. ""The carriers like the idea of instantaneous provisioning. And I think  it has a lot of potential [for] . . . selling it to businesses and giving  them the ability to cut their costs significantly by buying it as they need  it.""       ""We aspire to that kind of model,"" says Fred Buehler, director of electronic  business at Eastman Chemical Co. in Kingsport, Tenn.  ""In every sector, there will be one or two innovators who get out front and  do things differently to create shareholder value,"" Buehler says. ""We're  trying to be one of them.""  Market Maker  Stroll through the gas-trading section on the 32nd floor of Enron's  glistening 50-story headquarters, and the company's technological  sophistication is immediately evident. Traders like 26-year-old John Arnold,  who personally executes about $1 billion per day in trades, have real-time  access to virtually any information that might affect their split-second  buy-and-sell decisions.  That information might be a meteorologist's prediction of a  colder-than-normal winter across the Plains states or a live news report of  political instability in an oil-producing country in the Middle East.  Behind the scenes, all of Arnold's trades are instantly analyzed and  processed by a sophisticated, proprietary risk-management system and then  updated across multiple back-end computer systems worldwide. Less than a year  after launching the operation, 60% of the world's gas is traded on  EnronOnline.  ""What we are doing, no one in the industry did 10 years ago. Eighty percent  of our income this year is from businesses that didn't exist 10 years ago,""  says Skilling.  For example, EnronOnline contributed heavily to its parent company's  third-quarter earnings, which were up 31% to $292 million, compared with the  same period last year.  ""The change is technology-driven,"" Skilling adds. ""We couldn't do what we do  without massive amounts of computing capability."" In this regard, Enron joins  a short list of companies that includes Wal-Mart Stores Inc., FedEx Corp. and  American Airlines Inc., which famously pioneered various mission-critical IT  techniques to leapfrog competitors and create a whole new class of IT-enabled  industry leaders.  Among Enron's boldest ideas is its use of a single, powerful software-based  trading platform to insert itself as a principal buyer or seller in hundreds  of different markets. Currently, Enron trades more than 1,000 different  commodities, such as gold, natural gas and metals, on EnronOnline.  ""The core of our business is our business model, which is a centralized  risk-management and market-making business model. It just so happens that the  Internet is just perfect for improving the efficiency of that model,""  Skilling says.  But as a market maker, EnronOnline stands alone. For starters, unlike most  other Internet marketplaces, it's free. There are no transaction fees or  catalog, inventory or subscription costs for users.  ""Enron has broken away from the pack in the last year, in terms of their  capital growth,"" says Ian Wylie, vice president of e-business at BP Amoco PLC  in London. ""And e-business is responsible for a lot of this change.""  Even more unusual is Enron's role as a principal in each transaction. That  means Enron is either the buyer or seller in every trade in which it's  involved, unlike market makers that simply act as matchmakers between buyers  and sellers.  In fact, Skilling, as well as Mike McConnell, who heads EnronOnline's global  expansion efforts as president and CEO of Enron Global Markets LLC, dismisses  much of the current hyperactivity surrounding other fee-based  business-to-business exchanges as a flash in the pan.  ""[Many of the] B2B guys think all you have to do is set up a bulletin board  and people will start transacting, but it doesn't work that way,"" Skilling  says. ""You need to know you can deliver if push comes to shove.""  As either the seller or buyer in all of its trades, Enron, an established  brand name with 32,000 miles of pipeline and deep financial pockets,  guarantees delivery or payment on all trades that are executed on  EnronOnline.  ""We're creating markets that were highly illiquid, so someone has to put  their reputation on the line to say, 'We'll deliver,' "" Skilling says.  But guaranteeing delivery also requires having guaranteed access to physical  assets such as network bandwidth and papermaking plants. Guaranteed access  also ensures marketplace liquidity. For Enron, this is where the bricks and  mortar come in.  For example, to help drive its liquidity in the pulp and paper market, Enron  paid $72 million in July for Garden State Paper Co., a recycled-newsprint  mill in Garfield, N.J.  Skilling's current market fancy is metals, and in May, Enron bought MG PLC, a  London-based metals marketer. ""You have to break the liquidity logjam, and to  do that, you have to take a risk position,"" Skilling says.  But once the logjam is cleared, Enron is just as likely to sell off the  brick-and-mortar assets it acquired and use the cash to invest in new  business.  For example, to finance its new bandwidth-trading operation, Enron is selling  Portland General Electric Co., a Portland, Ore.-based power producer that it  bought in 1997, so it could bring liquidity to and guarantee trades in the  online electricity market.  Eventually, Enron may end up trading commodities that aren't even considered  commodities - at least not at the moment - such as data storage capacity or  empty railcar space.  ""Might we move into sauces or meats or grains? Potentially,"" says McConnell,  who was Enron's de facto CIO before moving into his current role.  ""You have to be creative every day,"" McConnell says. ""You have to be  open-minded to trying new things.""  But what remains constant throughout all the upsizing and downsizing is  Enron's core IT-enabled business model, which is what puts it in a class of  its own, analysts say.  ""People have talked a lot about systems that they're about to roll out, but  there is just not much out there for direct trading,"" says Mike Heim, an  energy analyst at A.G. Edwards & Sons Inc. in St. Louis. ""Enron rolled out  its technology 10 months ago, and still there isn't much else out there.  There hasn't been much competition [because] there isn't anybody in the same  class.""  But just last month, Houston-based Dynegy Inc. launched Dynegydirect, an  Internet-based, commission-free trading site for energy and communications  commodities.  Also last month, IntercontinentalExchange in Atlanta, whose partners include  BP Amoco and The Hague-based Royal Dutch/Shell Group, added natural gas and  power to its online trading system, which already included precious metals  and crude oil.  Skilling doesn't get called ""nuts"" much anymore. In fact, he's a darling on  Wall Street, where Enron's stock has soared from around $40 per share last  November to $81 as of this Nov. 2. As a result, Enron - by all accounts, an  Old Economy gas pipeline company until 12 months ago - is widely regarded as  a New Economy pioneer.  Says Skilling, ""We like to say we were B2B before there was B2B.""   Thriving On the Unconventional  As head of two Enron pipeline subsidiaries, Mike McConnell knew a lot more  about gas flows than he did about data flows last year when he got a surprise  call from Enron President and Chief Operating Officer Jeff Skilling.  Recalls McConnell, ""Jeff went into this whole thought process about how the  Internet is changing everything. He said, 'We need to make Enron an  e-business, and I need a guy that can run this as a business. We need to  change the way we view technology.'  ""I thought he was a little crazy and I said, 'Jeff, I'm not a technology  person at all,' He said, 'No, seriously - this is going to be big.' So I took  over as CEO of Enron Global Technology,"" and thus became the company's de  facto CIO, McConnell explains.  Appointing a person with no technology background to the top IT post is an  unusual move. But Enron often defies convention and typically thrives as a  result. Indeed, Enron boasts an entrepreneurial culture that's unusual in  large, long-established companies, and in utilities firms in particular.  McConnell relates the tale of how 29-year-old Louise Kitchen, Enron's head  gas trader in Europe, spearheaded the creation of an online gas-trading  system, recruiting IT people from elsewhere in the company to do the  development work. Word of the Web-based platform, EnronOnline, which is  literally remaking the company, didn't reach top management until a few weeks  before it went live.  Kitchen enlisted the support of Enron's initially skeptical top traders, and  she scoured the company for software developers and other experts. Her small  army of volunteers worked nights and weekends on the project while carrying  on with their regular jobs.  ""It's an amazing story about not getting corporate approval and going through  all the bureaucracy,"" McConnell says. ""No one went to the board and said, 'We  want to change the way we trade.' You just do it.""  Glowing Endorsement  Soon after McConnell became the de facto CIO of the $40 billion energy  company, he joined eight of Sun Microsystems Inc.'s top Houston customers at  a breakfast hosted by Sun CEO Scott McNealy.  ""I was very nervous,"" recalls McConnell, 40. ""I mean, McNealy is the guy, and  here I know nothing about technology. I'd been on the job maybe two weeks.""  McNealy asked the attendees - all but McConnell were middle-aged CIOs with  many years of IT experience - to introduce themselves in turn.  ""When Scott came to me, I said, 'I'm the CEO of Global Technology, and we  want to be the leader in B2B commerce in the world.' He kind of sat back and  said, 'How long have you been in the IT business?' "" McConnell explains. ""  'About nine days,' I said, 'and we are going to take a little bit different  approach to technology.' Scott chuckled and said, 'That sounds like Enron; it  always looks at things differently.' He then stated that my CEO title and  Enron's approach were very unusual but that it would be more commonplace  soon, as this was the way of the future.""  McConnell says McNealy's endorsement had ""a huge impact"" on how he structured  IT at Enron during the following year.  ""I realized that we weren't too late to change our approach and take a  commercial view of technology,"" he says - a view of IT as an integral part of  the business, not as something that supports business functions. ""None of the  other companies were thinking our new way at all.""  Taking a commercial view of IT has led to a blurring of the line that  traditionally separates IT organizations from the business units they  support. When McConnell became CEO of Global Technology, Enron had five CIOs  who were predominantly operating independently inside the company's major  lines of business.  ""Each CIO had his own agenda, his own thought process, his own goals, and  they did not communicate at all,"" he says.  McConnell established corporate standards for IT, created a management team  that included the five CIOs and put all IT people under a new chief  technology officer, Philippe Bibi.  But IT is far from centralized at Enron. ""We wanted to make people think  about technology not as IT and support, but as an extension of your  business,"" he explains. ""So we seeded people out into the business units.  [IT] directs the performance review process, but the business units have the  greatest influence on where the person actually ranks and is rated.""  Firms like Enron that merge IT departments with the business units they serve  will be the winners among fast-paced e-businesses, says IT organization  expert Robert Zawacki, president of Zawacki and Associates in Colorado  Springs and a professor emeritus at the University of Colorado, also in  Colorado Springs. ""We need more entrepreneurial leaders in IT, and  [McConnell] is certainly one,"" he says.  IT makes it easier to be entrepreneurial, says McConnell, who is now  president and CEO of Enron Global Markets. ""We really do like to try things  and see what happens, and when you have an electronic platform like  [EnronOnline] that we can model into different sectors, it's very inexpensive  to try it. We are not afraid; if it's not working, we'll just stop."" - Gary  H.

"Dear Mr McConnell  Thank you for your e-mail. To reply to your queries: Meier Graefe was the name of the man who directed the print publishing business of Pan in the 1890's. 'Pan' was the name under which the business issued a literary and arts magazine in Berlin, but with a special focus on French art. Pan issued sets of lithographs and etchings, mostly specially commissioned from the artists and drawn especially for Pan, as in the case of the Cross and Signac, to accompany the the text of the magazine. These prints are referred to as the Pan 'album'.  The Signac is from the regular edition of the Pan album, and as such is not numbered. Only the de-luxe edition was numbered (see Cross). Neither Signac nor Cross are signed in the stone. Both are very well known and fully documented works by the artists.  I will look forward to hearing further from you.

Background: First we wanted to do something new that would promote Enron positively.  (There are a lot of conferences with happenings for power traders) Most of the participants were traders or very interested in trading. Could we do any deals that evening? We invited them because they should start  doing deals with Enron. Several of the companies attending needed to change their risk policy to do  weather deals.  Lottery: We made a lottery that was similar to a weather deal. But we made the option  premium to 15,-  Nok and max payment if the option stroked to 100,- NOK. Our  counterparties should not loose a lot of money, so they paid the premium  upfront and they was not allowed to sell any options.  The counter parties, that were the traders and not the companies, did their  first weather deals with Enron.  It was important that the traders could go  short or long or both. (Buy both put and call, for the traders that was  afraid of their possitions) Some bought 10 contracts and they really felt  that they traded weather deals.   The most positive in my opinion was that over 20 companies have traders that  have done weather deals already.

If we had 1/3 of our GSA price  linked to Brent our exposure for 20 years would be about 30 million barrels  notional or about 14 million barrels PV.  At 5% our exposure would still be 5  million notional or 2.3 million PV.  According to John, he would not be  comfortable doing anything past 2012 and even out that far he would not  consider doing more than about 1 million PV barrels in the years 2010 -  2012.  Given these comments, I would say that the size of our deal basically  precludes a look at Crude Oil hedges at this time.  As far as the economics  of the deal are concerned, we basically cannot even get an Offer to use to  figure out our economics.  I am confident that if we pushed the issue to see  if we could get a 20 year offer even for a small portion of the volumes that  the hedging costs would be too high, and therefore have left it at that for  the time being.

Please see below in blue our observations and  answers. Let's talk later today if you have further questions.  Saludos  Guido and Emilio    Enron Offtake Agreement  Section 2 Should this agreement start at commercial hand over of the plant under the  EPC agreement.  Benefit here is LDs under the EPC for late delivery go to  project company and project company has no obligation to lng buyers.  In  addition it preserves your 20 year offtake which should still match your GSA.   The agreement should start at commercial hand over of the plant as you say.  The draft as it is now has only outer limits as to when that should happen  (that being the earlier of 40 months after Financial  Close or NTP or Dec 31  2004). We will add to this list ""the earlier of"" something like: ""the date on  which the plant has produced LNG at at least 90% of its capacity for a period  of 10 consecutive days"". We suggest putting something like this as opposed to  ""commercial hand over"" because this is in the plant's/contractor's control  and they could, for example, on purpose not meet a noise level requirement  for 4 months  for example and delay commencement of the offtake contract  while the project sells LNG at higher prices than in the term sheets.  With regards to the EPC LDs we agree that they should go only to the project  but we, as offtakers, can not wait for ever for the project to be completed  with out receiving gas or damages for something that is somehow (directly or  indirectly) under the project's control. We have 4 months limits to how much  the project can be delayed on top of all the conservatism that EECC (or  another EPC Contractor) already built in.    Section 6 I would like to see some language in this section describing the pricing  formula associated with expansions.  Structure could be set as in this  contract where Pg is to reflect GSA costs and where the combined value of  Pcpi and Pa should be derived to provide an equity return to the sponsors of  18%.   We agree that would be better, but we included this section knowing that is  something that is going to be a very difficult sell with PDVSA, because they  don't want us to sell down and then keep ""controlling"" new  LNG businesses in  Jose. They will oppose this clause as they violently opposed the limited  exclusivity at Jose that we managed to include in the GSA. We think that  adding a restriction to the asset's returns now in the draft will make it  very tough to sell to PDVSA the entire Clause. Thus, jeopardizing our chance  to control the output of future plants or expansions. We never intended to  use these off-take agreements as a vehicle to control future LNG volumes.  Nevertheless, we felt it was a good chance for us to start getting partial  control of the output. Pushing it too much will back fire and PDVSA will  clearly realize what our intent is.  Section 7 Where is the bonus calculation?  We did not include it now on purpose. We  will include it when ever they ""remind"" us to do so. We want to have another  fight about the bonus. Where is the min price? The minimum price is in. We say that one of the   terms in the price is Pg x En where En is never less than one I thought you guys were going to trade out CPI for a fixed number? We are  going to try to do it, but that is first a GSA issue, and we don't want to  put it here as something firm before we change it in the GSA. We precisely  bracketed the CPI percentage in the formula because of our thought that we  want to make it zero   Have you decided that a WTI index percentage does not help the economics? No,  we don't have the definitive answer from structuring yet, but our guess and  based on our meeting with RAC the other day, in which they told us about the  mess created by an oil escalation in Cuiba (Brazil power plant), we are  pretty much convinced that oil escalation without oil based LNG sales is not  convenient. But since we don't have a definitive answer yet we still included  oil as a possible escalator with a zero weighting (that should have been  bracketed in the term-sheet, though, and it will).    Section 10 you have incorporated the GSA default rate for late payment as opposed to the  Equilibrium rate.  Is this your intent to have a mismatch?  Yes, we did it on purpose because this will apply also to PDVSA as  off-taker, and they have a record of paying late so we want them to suffer if  they do.  you have all new taxes being borne by the project company.  Will the banks  accept this as the project company will be thinly capitalized.  See section  18 of the Arcos CTA for ideas if this is an issue.  The exporter of record will be the project, so the buyer has no business in  Venezuela other than paying port fees. We do not see any kind of taxes that  could be imposed on Buyer by Venezuela that would eventually be transferred  to the project. Banks should be fine with this as this is a risk that  projects typically take all the time (the heavy crude projects are some  examples in Venezuela). In addition, the GSA provides for a number of reliefs  for the Project Company that will help Banks and equity holders to feel  safer. Although, a large portion of the underlying risk is always there.   Other where are the LD calculations explained?  I think you need LDs for GSA  default and another for plant default.  GSA default should match LD's in GSA  contract less compensation to plant debt recovery.  In stead of writing an explicit LD calculation our lawyers suggested that  the sole use of New York law to rule the deal was simpler and better. New  York law provides for full market based damages (market price of commodity  plus extra costs) which is the maximum you can get in a negotiation for an LD  clause. So, from a legal and commercial point of view we much rather have it  as it is. We are still discussing w/ Brent Price and Cris Sherman if this is  sellable to AA for MTM, but our initial view is that it should be since the  level of LD can not be better. GSA default is market based (provided that  PDVSA, as we expect, accepts the change we will propose) so the Project  Company will be able to pay market based damages. For interruption of gas  supply from PDV for Force Majeure reasons our insurance team is finding out  if the market will cover such risk so that the project can afford not being  relieved from performance in such event (this will obviously be to a maximum  dollar limit to be determined and for a maximum period of time, say 36 months  - we need time to give you precision on this, but some sort of coverage will  be available).   suppose the plant produces 5% less that it is supposed to due to design or  tech problems (not a FM issue) at commercial hand over.  What happens under  the offtake agreements?  Will the banks accept this revenue short fall?  Will  we have to create a reserve?  This may be a big issue with the banks for  technology reasons and lack of experience in this industry.   Under the off-take agreements the project pays market based damages if it  does not meet the contracted volume. We believe that the contracted volume  that we included in the term sheets though has enough of a cushion for banks  and equity holders to bear the risk. We are contracting for contractually  guaranteed production under the EPC which is 3% lower than expected. On top  of that we are considering LNG production with the richest inlet gas possible  (meaning a lower LNG volume). This volume is 5% lower than the guaranteed  production with ""Normal"" or expected feed composition. Combining these two we  have a contracted quantity that is 8% lower than the expected production with  expected feed. On top of this it is important to note that every single LNG  plant in the world ended up with a production capacity that is at least 10%  above what was expected (mostly due to EPC Contractors and tech partners  making very safe assumptions on guaranteed volumes to avoid LDs). Also the  EPC contract being negotiated provides for pretty severe LD in case of  production shortfalls that are enough to pay for debt and make equity-holders  whole. They don't provide though, for damages payable under off-take  contracts (nobody will take this potentially huge exposure on LDs). However,  as we explained, we believe that this is a risk that is typically taken by  producers and that we have already taken a very conservative assumption in  the volume contracted and that should be beard by the Project Co. Banks will  most definitely also take a conservative volume assumption, as we already  did.   What happens if plant starts producing less for a few weeks until problem is  resolved? what compensation do the offtakers get? do the banks suffer here as  well?  The term sheet establishes an annual quantity as the only standard to  determine failure to deliver by Seller. It also establishes that deliveries  should be at rates and intervals that are reasonably constant. The bottom  line is that the termsheets do not go into all the detail about timing of  defaults and price differentials. It sets, however, a reasonable standard by  which if at the end of the year seller did not deliver the full annual  quantity and a particular month can be identified where the deficiency occur  based on the ""reasonable constant deliveries"" provision, damages will be  payable based on prices during such month. Yes banks suffer here to the  extent that the cause of the short fall is not insurable.  Nevertheless,  short periods (weeks) of failures to deliver by seller will really not affect  the Project Company ability to pay the Banks.  It will have to be some  prolonged period for Banks to be affected.     Under a plant FM issue you may not get BI cover for the first 60 days.  Will  the banks accept this or will they want a reserve established.  Is this in  your model?  We are not sure off what the banks are going to require in this regard  (although, we agree that some sort of reserve or LC is to be expected). Our  model assumes the cost of an LC for 6 month debt service (which should be  plenty). The issue here is if MTM is going to be able to live with the same  or longer grace period for damages to kick in under the termsheet and weather  damages (not BI) are insurable and to what extent if FM relief is not  permitted for MTM reasons. The question that follows is: if damages exceed  the insured limits in a FM event that does not relief the project from its  obligation to deliver, have the damages have to be senior to debt payments  for AA to allow MTM to be permitted? If this is so, are the banks going to be  willing to live with this?, probably not.  insert something on planned maintenance timing and scheduling.  It is briefly covered in section 9 second paragraph. This will be expended  in later drafts once the PA is signed and we are home free with regard to  PDVSA.  insert termination section  In light of the fact that we will end up being more of an off-taker than an  asset owner in this project our lawyers suggest that we will get better  protection if early termination is ruled by what is provided under NY law  than if we try to right an early termination clause. They point out also that  90% of LNG contracts are done in this way, having NY law rule the game. They  point out also that from the project point of view banks are very used to and  prefer having early termination be ruled by NY law.    put something in about the buyer willing to accept entering direct agreements  for financing requirements?  We will     Eric Gonzales@ECT 11/28/2000 03:40 AM To: Guido Caranti/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT, Emilio  Vicens/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENt cc: Larry Lawyer/NA/Enron@Enron, Cris Sherman/HOU/ECT@ECT, Brent A  Price/HOU/ECT@ECT, Eric Groves/HOU/ECT@ECT, Daniel R  Rogers/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT   Subject: Re: Jose LNG - Off-take Comments     Enron Offtake Agreement  Section 2 Should this agreement start at commercial hand over of the plant under the  EPC agreement.

What can J Wilson do thru  2010?  I want the crude desk to make us a price and present an acceptable  volume.    If we have to suggest to PDVSA only doing a crude index through 2012, I  strongly believe we should try if we can create some additional value thru  this structure.  Tell me if you would like me to give him a call to explain  what the effort potentially create.  Thanks Eric         Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp.

If we had 1/3 of our GSA price  linked to Brent our exposure for 20 years would be about 30 million barrels  notional or about 14 million barrels PV.  At 5% our exposure would still be 5  million notional or 2.3 million PV.  According to John, he would not be  comfortable doing anything past 2012 and even out that far he would not  consider doing more than about 1 million PV barrels in the years 2010 -  2012.  Given these comments, I would say that the size of our deal basically  precludes a look at Crude Oil hedges at this time.  As far as the economics  of the deal are concerned, we basically cannot even get an Offer to use to  figure out our economics.  I am confident that if we pushed the issue to see  if we could get a 20 year offer even for a small portion of the volumes that  the hedging costs would be too high, and therefore have left it at that for  the time being.   Please advise if you have any thoughts on the issue.

Please see below in blue our observations and  answers. Let's talk later today if you have further questions.  Saludos  Guido and Emilio    Enron Offtake Agreement  Section 2 Should this agreement start at commercial hand over of the plant under the  EPC agreement.  Benefit here is LDs under the EPC for late delivery go to  project company and project company has no obligation to lng buyers.  In  addition it preserves your 20 year offtake which should still match your GSA.   The agreement should start at commercial hand over of the plant as you say.  The draft as it is now has only outer limits as to when that should happen  (that being the earlier of 40 months after Financial  Close or NTP or Dec 31  2004). We will add to this list ""the earlier of"" something like: ""the date on  which the plant has produced LNG at at least 90% of its capacity for a period  of 10 consecutive days"". We suggest putting something like this as opposed to  ""commercial hand over"" because this is in the plant's/contractor's control  and they could, for example, on purpose not meet a noise level requirement  for 4 months  for example and delay commencement of the offtake contract  while the project sells LNG at higher prices than in the term sheets.  With regards to the EPC LDs we agree that they should go only to the project  but we, as offtakers, can not wait for ever for the project to be completed  with out receiving gas or damages for something that is somehow (directly or  indirectly) under the project's control. We have 4 months limits to how much  the project can be delayed on top of all the conservatism that EECC (or  another EPC Contractor) already built in.    Section 6 I would like to see some language in this section describing the pricing  formula associated with expansions.  Structure could be set as in this  contract where Pg is to reflect GSA costs and where the combined value of  Pcpi and Pa should be derived to provide an equity return to the sponsors of  18%.   We agree that would be better, but we included this section knowing that is  something that is going to be a very difficult sell with PDVSA, because they  don't want us to sell down and then keep ""controlling"" new  LNG businesses in  Jose. They will oppose this clause as they violently opposed the limited  exclusivity at Jose that we managed to include in the GSA. We think that  adding a restriction to the asset's returns now in the draft will make it  very tough to sell to PDVSA the entire Clause. Thus, jeopardizing our chance  to control the output of future plants or expansions. We never intended to  use these off-take agreements as a vehicle to control future LNG volumes.  Nevertheless, we felt it was a good chance for us to start getting partial  control of the output. Pushing it too much will back fire and PDVSA will  clearly realize what our intent is.  Section 7 Where is the bonus calculation?  We did not include it now on purpose. We  will include it when ever they ""remind"" us to do so. We want to have another  fight about the bonus. Where is the min price? The minimum price is in. We say that one of the   terms in the price is Pg x En where En is never less than one I thought you guys were going to trade out CPI for a fixed number? We are  going to try to do it, but that is first a GSA issue, and we don't want to  put it here as something firm before we change it in the GSA. We precisely  bracketed the CPI percentage in the formula because of our thought that we  want to make it zero   Have you decided that a WTI index percentage does not help the economics? No,  we don't have the definitive answer from structuring yet, but our guess and  based on our meeting with RAC the other day, in which they told us about the  mess created by an oil escalation in Cuiba (Brazil power plant), we are  pretty much convinced that oil escalation without oil based LNG sales is not  convenient. But since we don't have a definitive answer yet we still included  oil as a possible escalator with a zero weighting (that should have been  bracketed in the term-sheet, though, and it will).    Section 10 you have incorporated the GSA default rate for late payment as opposed to the  Equilibrium rate.  Is this your intent to have a mismatch?  Yes, we did it on purpose because this will apply also to PDVSA as  off-taker, and they have a record of paying late so we want them to suffer if  they do.  you have all new taxes being borne by the project company.  Will the banks  accept this as the project company will be thinly capitalized.  See section  18 of the Arcos CTA for ideas if this is an issue.  The exporter of record will be the project, so the buyer has no business in  Venezuela other than paying port fees. We do not see any kind of taxes that  could be imposed on Buyer by Venezuela that would eventually be transferred  to the project. Banks should be fine with this as this is a risk that  projects typically take all the time (the heavy crude projects are some  examples in Venezuela). In addition, the GSA provides for a number of reliefs  for the Project Company that will help Banks and equity holders to feel  safer. Although, a large portion of the underlying risk is always there.   Other where are the LD calculations explained?  I think you need LDs for GSA  default and another for plant default.  GSA default should match LD's in GSA  contract less compensation to plant debt recovery.  In stead of writing an explicit LD calculation our lawyers suggested that  the sole use of New York law to rule the deal was simpler and better. New  York law provides for full market based damages (market price of commodity  plus extra costs) which is the maximum you can get in a negotiation for an LD  clause. So, from a legal and commercial point of view we much rather have it  as it is. We are still discussing w/ Brent Price and Cris Sherman if this is  sellable to AA for MTM, but our initial view is that it should be since the  level of LD can not be better. GSA default is market based (provided that  PDVSA, as we expect, accepts the change we will propose) so the Project  Company will be able to pay market based damages. For interruption of gas  supply from PDV for Force Majeure reasons our insurance team is finding out  if the market will cover such risk so that the project can afford not being  relieved from performance in such event (this will obviously be to a maximum  dollar limit to be determined and for a maximum period of time, say 36 months  - we need time to give you precision on this, but some sort of coverage will  be available).   suppose the plant produces 5% less that it is supposed to due to design or  tech problems (not a FM issue) at commercial hand over.  What happens under  the offtake agreements?  Will the banks accept this revenue short fall?  Will  we have to create a reserve?  This may be a big issue with the banks for  technology reasons and lack of experience in this industry.   Under the off-take agreements the project pays market based damages if it  does not meet the contracted volume. We believe that the contracted volume  that we included in the term sheets though has enough of a cushion for banks  and equity holders to bear the risk. We are contracting for contractually  guaranteed production under the EPC which is 3% lower than expected. On top  of that we are considering LNG production with the richest inlet gas possible  (meaning a lower LNG volume). This volume is 5% lower than the guaranteed  production with ""Normal"" or expected feed composition. Combining these two we  have a contracted quantity that is 8% lower than the expected production with  expected feed. On top of this it is important to note that every single LNG  plant in the world ended up with a production capacity that is at least 10%  above what was expected (mostly due to EPC Contractors and tech partners  making very safe assumptions on guaranteed volumes to avoid LDs). Also the  EPC contract being negotiated provides for pretty severe LD in case of  production shortfalls that are enough to pay for debt and make equity-holders  whole. They don't provide though, for damages payable under off-take  contracts (nobody will take this potentially huge exposure on LDs). However,  as we explained, we believe that this is a risk that is typically taken by  producers and that we have already taken a very conservative assumption in  the volume contracted and that should be beard by the Project Co. Banks will  most definitely also take a conservative volume assumption, as we already  did.   What happens if plant starts producing less for a few weeks until problem is  resolved? what compensation do the offtakers get? do the banks suffer here as  well?  The term sheet establishes an annual quantity as the only standard to  determine failure to deliver by Seller. It also establishes that deliveries  should be at rates and intervals that are reasonably constant. The bottom  line is that the termsheets do not go into all the detail about timing of  defaults and price differentials. It sets, however, a reasonable standard by  which if at the end of the year seller did not deliver the full annual  quantity and a particular month can be identified where the deficiency occur  based on the ""reasonable constant deliveries"" provision, damages will be  payable based on prices during such month. Yes banks suffer here to the  extent that the cause of the short fall is not insurable.  Nevertheless,  short periods (weeks) of failures to deliver by seller will really not affect  the Project Company ability to pay the Banks.  It will have to be some  prolonged period for Banks to be affected.     Under a plant FM issue you may not get BI cover for the first 60 days.  Will  the banks accept this or will they want a reserve established.  Is this in  your model?  We are not sure off what the banks are going to require in this regard  (although, we agree that some sort of reserve or LC is to be expected). Our  model assumes the cost of an LC for 6 month debt service (which should be  plenty). The issue here is if MTM is going to be able to live with the same  or longer grace period for damages to kick in under the termsheet and weather  damages (not BI) are insurable and to what extent if FM relief is not  permitted for MTM reasons. The question that follows is: if damages exceed  the insured limits in a FM event that does not relief the project from its  obligation to deliver, have the damages have to be senior to debt payments  for AA to allow MTM to be permitted? If this is so, are the banks going to be  willing to live with this?, probably not.  insert something on planned maintenance timing and scheduling.  It is briefly covered in section 9 second paragraph. This will be expended  in later drafts once the PA is signed and we are home free with regard to  PDVSA.  insert termination section  In light of the fact that we will end up being more of an off-taker than an  asset owner in this project our lawyers suggest that we will get better  protection if early termination is ruled by what is provided under NY law  than if we try to right an early termination clause. They point out also that  90% of LNG contracts are done in this way, having NY law rule the game. They  point out also that from the project point of view banks are very used to and  prefer having early termination be ruled by NY law.    put something in about the buyer willing to accept entering direct agreements  for financing requirements?  We will     Eric Gonzales@ECT 11/28/2000 03:40 AM To: Guido Caranti/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT, Emilio  Vicens/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENt cc: Larry Lawyer/NA/Enron@Enron, Cris Sherman/HOU/ECT@ECT, Brent A  Price/HOU/ECT@ECT, Eric Groves/HOU/ECT@ECT, Daniel R  Rogers/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT   Subject: Re: Jose LNG - Off-take Comments     Enron Offtake Agreement  Section 2 Should this agreement start at commercial hand over of the plant under the  EPC agreement.

"I understand that you will be meeting with Dale Lawrence and Casey Olson from  Oxy on Thursday, and that Terry will be briefing you on the Saudi project  opportunities first thing Thursday am and will be participating with you in  the meeting.  After re-reading the Saudi proposals today, I offer the following thoughts  and suggestions for your meeting.  Terry can fill you in on more details.  Background  The Saudi Gas initiative was kicked off by the Crown Prince during a visit to  the US in the fall of 1999.  The intent was to encourage foreign investors to  bring capital and technology into the country to build a privatized gas,  power and water infrastructure system and to create jobs and investment  opportunities for Saudis.  The initiative is being led by the Foreign  Minister because the Crown Prince is aware of resistance from Aramco, the Oil  Ministry, Saudi Electric Co and Saudi Water Co.  In spite of continuing  resistance from these very powerful groups, the initiative is moving forward  essentially on schedule.  When the initiative was first announced, Enron tried to get onto the  shortlist but was told that we would not qualify because we did not have  adequate international upstream expertise.  At the same time, Oxy tried to  get onto the shortlist but was told that they did not have adequate  downstream/infrastructure expertise.  Oxy approached us to form a  partnership, which we did in good faith but with no written agreement.  We  still have not signed an agreement with Oxy, but we have traded many drafts  and are within days of executing an agreed MOU.  We have been working  together in good faith on orally agreed terms consistent with the draft MOU.  Oxy and Enron are a good fit because Oxy shares many of the Enron values  (urgency, bottom-line focus, objective is money, not necessarily booked  reserves, etc.)  Oxy has made it clear that they are primarily interested in  upstream investment in Saudi and we have made it clear that we are not  interested in upstream investment.  Oxy understands the recent changes in  philosophy in Enron and is ok with this, but at the same time they are  worried that we may not want to put any capital in Saudi and thus could  jeopardize Oxy's competitiveness in the upcoming beauty pageant.  Oxy maintains that throughout the process, Dr. Irani's personal friendship  with the Saudi Foreign Minister has been a big driving force in moving our  proposals forward.  There is probably some truth to this.  However, at the  same time, it is clear to both Oxy and to Enron that the Saudi bureaucracy is  more intrigued with Enron than with Oxy and want to find a role for us.   Since all of our presentations to the Saudis have been joint Oxy/Enron  presentations, the Saudis view us as linked together.   This is a huge deal for Oxy and the dream of a lifetime for Irani.  They are  afraid that if Enron drops out (which we have the clear right to do), the  Saudis may disqualify Oxy.  I believe that their fears are justified----I  can't imagine the Saudis allowing Oxy to proceed alone without Enron.   Proposed Way Forward  We and Oxy have been shortlisted, along with several other oil companies for  two projects:  -Core Project 2, which is an E & P opportunity on the Red Sea coast near  Jordan, combined with a gas/liquids processing plant, a pipeline, a potential  power/water plant and a potential petrochemicals facility.  The market area  on the Red Sea coast has huge growth potential.  -Core Project 3, which is an E & P opportunity in SE Saudi near the UAE  border, combined with a pipeline to eastern Saudi, a liquids plant, and  several potential downstream facilities.  There is the potential to export  this gas to the UAE/Dolphin, but it is a long shot.  Terry can give you details on both of these proposed projects.  Each of these projects will require several billion dollars of capital and  they each have large upstream components.  The marketing network potential  (both within Saudi and internationally) is huge, but the dilemma is to carve  out a role for Enron that fits with our corporate philosophy.  I understand that Dale Lawrence has proposed to you that we tell the Saudis  that Oxy/Enron want to proceed as joint partners and then settle up ""behind  the veil"" such that the upstream capital and risk are Oxy responsibilities.   I don't like this approach because the press won't see beyond the veil and  will report it as Enron being a 50/50 partner in one or two $4 billion deals  in Saudi.  On the other hand, I want to be in these projects because the potential in  Saudi is huge and the EGM spin-offs (liquids, etc.) could also be huge.  I  believe that there is a simple way to address both our needs and Oxy's needs.   The Saudi proposals break both Core Project 2 and Core Project 3 into two  pieces:  -an upstream E & P and gas processing venture, under a traditional PSC  arrangement with Aramco as the controlling partner and the foreign partner as  operator, and  -various downstream pipeline, power, water and potentially distribution  companies in which Aramco will not be a participant, but that other Saudi  investors may want a piece of.  These downstream ventures will buy gas from  the upstream ventures and will be subject to pipeline and privatisation  regulatory regimes that have not yet been invented.  I suggest that we propose to the Saudis that Enron and Oxy will be working as  partners, but that Oxy will be the sole investor and operator for all  upstream components.  Enron, on the other hand, will undertake to be the  developer and operator for the pipelines and downstream facilities, but will  structure such projects as opportunities for various  Saudi investors  supported by Project financing and with IPO's as soon as possible.  In  structuring such projects, Enron would work with the Saudi government to  develop appropriate regulatory regimes.   Enron, as developer and operator,  would forego the right to any equity in such projects in order to maximize  the investment opportunities for Saudis but would instead cover its  development costs and earn a profit via operating and development fees to the  downstream ventures and success fees at financial close and/or other  milestones.  This approach would give Oxy the hard capital investment in Saudi that they  want, while giving Enron the opportunity to earn a return on intellectual  capital.  It would give us the chance that we want for a dialogue with the  Saudis to define the basis for a robust market-oriented system----similar to  the opportunity that Enron Japan hopes to develop through working with the  Japanese government.  It would also give us an on the ground relationship  with government authorities that control policies for the export and  marketing of Saudi's crudes and liquids.  We could also offer to be the  exporter/offtaker for any liquids produced by Oxy.  Terry and Rob are going to kick this around a bit tonight and may have a more  well thought out approach by Thursday, but I wanted to get these basic  thoughts to you to give you, Terry and Rob some food for thought.

This is  going to be worse than what we had already forecasted at 250mb/month.   Essentially, what I take from this message is that they are agreeing to cut  the highest cost power out ( which is the Santa Rita power plant) and it is  only going to run @ 3mbd or less.   So instead of 250mb month that I had told  Scott Earnest it will now only be more like 100mb.

MANILA, PHILIPPINES | Friday-Saturday, December 15-16, 2000      Meralco settles access dispute with Napocor     With a new agreement signed Tuesday night, power distribution firm Manila  Electric Company (Meralco) and state-owned National Power Corporation  (Napocor) finally settled their dispute over alleged violations on ""open  access transmission.""      As a result, Meralco paid Napocor 684 million Philippine pesos ($13.661  million at PhP50.071=$1), representing its unpaid electricity bills for the  June 26 to July 25 billing period.      Meralco's bills actually amounted to PhP5.3 billion ($105.85 million), but it  paid only PhP4.6 billion ($91.87 million), claiming it incurred unnecessary  losses when the state utility failed to allow the output of its independent  power producer (IPPs) to come on stream. Meralco claimed Napocor should  absorb these losses.      Meralco paid about PhP20 million ($399,433) in accrued interests as Napocor,  for its part, claimed it failed to meet its own obligations because of  Meralco's non-payment.      In an interview with BusinessWorld, Napocor treasurer Laura F. Salandanan  said Meralco's payment eased the pressure on Napocor's very tight cash flows  as December always mean bigger debt servicing.      Under the letter of agreement signed by Napocor president Federico E. Puno  and Meralco executive vice-president and chief operating officer Jesus P.  Francisco, the full capacity of Meralco's IPP, particularly the 440-megawatt  (MW) Mauban coal-fired power plant operated by the Quezon Power (Phils.),  Ltd., will be able to come on stream.      On the other hand, minimal dispatch will be used for the 1,000-MW Sta. Rosa  combined cycle power plant operated by First Gas Power Corp.      In a separate interview, Napocor's department manager of utility economics  Jesusito Sulit said the two parties agreed to such a compromise since energy  from the Sta. Rita plant is higher because it uses condensate fuel in the  absence of the natural gas. Electricity produced from coal-fired power  plants, on the other hand, is less expensive.      Since the natural gas that will be fed to the Sta. Rita plant will come only  by January 2002, the agreement will be implemented retroactive to October 26,  2000 to December 26, 2001.      Mr. Sulit said Napocor will replace the Sta. Rita output by providing Meralco  with less expensive power and, at the same time, offer a discount rate of as  much as PhP1.16 per kilowatt hour (kWh).      This discount, Mr. Sulit said, will mean savings for Meralco because it no  longer needs to pay for the fuel requirements of Sta. Rita plant. Under the  power purchase deal between the two firms, Meralco spends for fuel used by  the plant.      First Gas, for its part, will still receive payments despite the unutilized  capacity of its plants because of the presence of the take-or-pay agreement.      For Napocor, it will be assured of a captured market and consequently  additional revenues in terms of higher energy sales.      Mr. Sulit said consumers are also expected to benefit not necessarily from a  much lower power rates but from an assurance that electricity bills will not  increase as much.

"Mike-  As we discussed, the timing of the Gaza Transfer Agreement has once again  become critical.  This e-mail will give you some background as to the  situation.  We financially closed the $90MM loan for the Gaza project last June. There  was a CP from the banks that the remaining $20MM of equity would not need to  be in the Project company until a date in the future.  This was done because  the project was placing a $20MM IPO locally and it was not possible to  complete the IPO before the debt financing.  The IPO has been successfully  subscribed; however, Enron has been blocking the transfer of the IPO funds  into the project company as we must have certain minor share transfers  completed prior to the transfer of the IPO funds in order to solidify our  U.S. tax deferral structure.    One of the covenants of the debt financing is that we must maintain a certain  debt to equity ratio in order to be able to draw more debt.  The project has  now reached the point in which it can no longer draw debt proceeds until the  remaining $20MM of equity (the IPO funds) are transferred into the project  account as these equity funds are required in order to allow for our  debt/equity ratio to be preserved.  The timing of this issue is being driven  by the fact that the project has to pay interest and commitment fees to the  bank on the 3rd of January.  The only source of these payments are the IPO  funds that must be transferred.  As mentioned above, Enron requires several minor share transfers in order to  preserve the U.S. tax deferral structure (5 or 10 shares need to be exchanged  in several companies in the chain).  These transfers must take place before  the IPO funds are put into the Project Company.  The language of these minor  transfers have been agreed among the partnership.  However, the partners are  refusing to execute these minor transfers until Enron executes the Transfer  Agreement.  When the Gaza project was being conceived, the former CALME management agreed  to the Transfer Agreement and this agreement was memorialized in detail in  the Joint Venture Agreement among the parties.  The Transfer Agreement  provides no party may have a change in control of their ownership in the  project without the consent of the other parties.  The JVA expressly states  that this transfer restriction is to be entered into by Enron Corp. and that  the restrictions on change of control apply all the way up the ownership  chain to Enron Corp. as well as to the other partners ultimate parent  entities.    A draft of this Transfer Agreement has been previously reviewed by Mark  Metts.  Mark indicated that he was not comfortable with the nature of the  agreement; however, this was last summer when Enron was re-evaluating its  position with respect to its international assets and it was thought that the  Gaza project may have soon not been part of Enron.     The Gaza team has spent a great deal of time over the past six months trying  to either soften the nature of the Transfer Agreement or to make the  restriction apply to some entity lower in the ownership chain than Enron  Corp.  These efforts have been unsuccessful as the partners claim that the  Transfer Agreement was a ""pillar"" of the deal that we had and furthermore  that this deal had been agreed directly with very senior Enron personnel.  Therefore, it appears that we must deal with the Transfer Agreement now in  order to allow Enron to preserve its tax deferral position, transfer the IPO  funds and ultimately allow the project to meet its debt service obligations  to the bank on January 3rd.  We have tried to bring this issue to a close  sooner, but the parnters have delayed resolution until now.  The timing of  this is unfortunate, but probably not accidental from our partners position.  You may reach me at any time at 502.458.4985 (through Thursday afternoon) or  at 713.522.4802 (home) or 713.818.9019 (mobile) beginning Thursday evening.

Volumes were booked at 31,000 barrels  per day with delivery starting June, 1999 through Dec., 2002.  Fuel  deliveries did not begin until April, 2000 and have averaged between  10,000-12,000 barrels per day, well below the volumetric level that was  booked.   This deficiency is due to delayed plant start-up and reduced  consumption and has resulted in approximately $1 million per month in accrual  losses to the Global Products group since April, 2000.  To make matters  worse, the power purchaser from First Gas has recently announced that they  are going to minimally dispatch the power plant to which this transaction is  linked through the end of 2001.  To properly reflect the current volumetric levels associated with First Gas,  we need to take volumes from the 31,000 barrels per day level that was  originally booked to approximately 6,000 barrels per day for the remainder of  the deal.  In addition, freight charges related to this deal have doubled since April,  2000 increasing from the $.70 originally booked to the current $1.45.  Per  conversations with John Chismar he expects freight to remain at this level  for the foreseeable future.  To properly reflect the current costs of this deal, we need to increase the  Dubai spread to which this deal was booked from $2.91 to approximately  $3.65.  Initial estimates of the loss resulting from both the volumetric and  cost proposed write-down of First Gas is $30 million.  We are continuing to  refine this number and will update you when we get a final amount.  On a final note, Arthur Andersen has repeatedly reviewed First Gas throughout  2000 and to this point we have been able to spin enough of an argument to  justify delaying a writedown.  Given the current market conditions discussed  above (which are publicly known), the size of the writedown and the fact that  their next review will be for year-end earnings, I believe Arthur Andersen is  going to require us to write down at least a substantial portion of First Gas  before they will sign-off on earnings.  Obviously, I have not recently  discussed this with AA&Co. but I do anticipate this being an earnings issue.  Please call me if you wish to discuss further.  I appreciate any help you can  give us in this matter.    ",brent.price@enron.com,mike.mcconnell@enron.com,Re: First Gas Writedown,2000-12-28 03:05:00-08:00,sent

These shipments are of 2 categories:   in-gauge cargo and out-of-gauge cargo, as explained below.  1. It will be recalled that upon the intervention of US Ambassador Indyk, PM  Barak gave us permission to transport plant goods to Gaza last October, and 4  trailers made it to the site. But fighting at the Karni crossing which  involved 10 Israeli tanks and the first reported use by the Palestinians of  anti-tank weapons put an end to these shipments.   2. For a second time, Ambassador Indyk obtained approval to transport plant  cargo to Gaza last week from PM Barak upon the recommendation of Israel's  Deputy Defense Minister, Ephraim Sneh. This initially applies to in-gauge  equipment that can be transported on a back- to- back basis; i.e., at the  border crossing a Palestinian truck replaces the Israeli truck and the  license plates are also changed, but the cargo stays on the same trailer.  Then the cargo gets hauled to the project site.  3. On Monday, Dec 25, 00 tralires of in-gauge imports from Ashdod, and from  IK Metal industry in Israel, will go to the site. (See the message from the  freight forwarder, below.) The 3-day Muslim holiday of Id al-Fitr will cause  these transports to be interrupted next week, after which they will resume.   4. The out-of-gauge equipment (e.g., gas turbines) cannot be transported in  this manner due to the lack of the necessary equipment on the Palestinian  side. Such equipment must go into Gaza in Israeli convoys with Israeli  heavy-lift equipment and Israeli operators. Before the disturbances that  started around the end of September, the Israelis and Palestinians worked out  a deal wherein the Israeli Army escorted the convoys to Netsarim Road (an  Israeli settlement in Gaza) and the Palestinian forces guarded the convoy  from that point until it was unloaded at the site. That is how the first 2  gas turbines were transported to the site.   In the present circumstances, two hurdles must be overcome; a) Israeli  transportation subcontractors are apparently unwilling to entrust the safety  of their equipment and personnel to Palestinian forces, b) the Israeli and  Palestinian forces have to work out a suitable arrangement for escorting the  Israeli convoys in Gaza. I had asked Samir Shawa to bring the latter issue to  the attention of the Palestinian authorities and he did. Last week, however,  Samir informed me that the Palestinian officer who was working on this matter  got killed accidentally. Samir was hopeful that the 2 sides will work it out.  Until this issue is resolved, it will be difficult to bring out -of- gauge  cargo into Gaza.  5. We will continue to work with the US Embassy, the Palestinian authorities,  and PEC  to get all plant cargo to the site. We hope that the political and  security situation will make this feasible.   I share Wail's concern and we are trying to use the present window of  opportunity to get plant goods to the site ASAP. We are pressuring AP and its  freight forwarder to get going.  6. Today, I received an e-mail from First Secretary of the US Embassy, John  Lister, regarding a follow-up meeting between Indyk and Sneh last Friday.  At  this meeting, Sneh reconfirmed the support of the GOI for this project. I  shall forward that e-mail to you.

Volumes were booked at 31,000 barrels  per day with delivery starting June, 1999 through Dec., 2002.  Fuel  deliveries did not begin until April, 2000 and have averaged between  10,000-12,000 barrels per day, well below the volumetric level that was  booked.   This deficiency is due to delayed plant start-up and reduced  consumption and has resulted in approximately $1 million per month in accrual  losses to the Global Products group since April, 2000.  To make matters  worse, the power purchaser from First Gas has recently announced that they  are going to minimally dispatch the power plant to which this transaction is  linked through the end of 2001.  To properly reflect the current volumetric levels associated with First Gas,  we need to take volumes from the 31,000 barrels per day level that was  originally booked to approximately 6,000 barrels per day for the remainder of  the deal.  In addition, freight charges related to this deal have doubled since April,  2000 increasing from the $.70 originally booked to the current $1.45.  Per  conversations with John Chismar he expects freight to remain at this level  for the foreseeable future.  To properly reflect the current costs of this deal, we need to increase the  Dubai spread to which this deal was booked from $2.91 to approximately  $3.65.  Initial estimates of the loss resulting from both the volumetric and  cost proposed write-down of First Gas is $30 million.  We are continuing to  refine this number and will update you when we get a final amount.  On a final note, Arthur Andersen has repeatedly reviewed First Gas throughout  2000 and to this point we have been able to spin enough of an argument to  justify delaying a writedown.  Given the current market conditions discussed  above (which are publicly known), the size of the writedown and the fact that  their next review will be for year-end earnings, I believe Arthur Andersen is  going to require us to write down at least a substantial portion of First Gas  before they will sign-off on earnings.  Obviously, I have not recently  discussed this with AA&Co. but I do anticipate this being an earnings issue.  Please call me if you wish to discuss further.  I appreciate any help you can  give us in this matter.       ",mike.mcconnell@enron.com,brent.price@enron.com,Re: First Gas Writedown,2000-12-28 08:01:00-08:00,received

I believe it is critical for very senior Enron people to make a  direct pitch to the President of the country as soon as we can arrange one.   We need to let the President know directly the benefits of the project and  the strong commitment of Enron to the development of the project.  We have  alreday done this several times, but it is time to do it again.  I recommend a visit in early January of maybe Frevert or you Mike (maybe  both). We can also use this visit to have meetings with the new President of  PDVSA and, hopefully, if there is an official Minister appointed with the new  Minister.  It is not easy to fit in the President's agenda, so please advise  the course of action and tentative dates.

"FYI ---------------------- Forwarded by Mike McConnell/HOU/ECT on 12/28/2000  04:08 PM --------------------------- From: Terence H Thorn@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT on 12/22/2000 01:28 PM To: Rick Bergsieker/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT cc: Mike McConnell/HOU/ECT@ECT  Subject: Oxy meeting  We just finished the meeting  with Dale Laurance and Casey Olson. Here's a  recap.  Oxy wanted to meet with Mike for two reasons:   1) Make sure Enron and Oxy had a project team in place asap and the  resources are committed to do a world class job on the January 29 submission  and subsequent presentations. As Mike noted- we are in sudden death overtime  and the 29th could be the end of the tournament.  2) Revisit the ""street talk"" about Enron redeploying capital.  Mike walked through the EGM organization, talked about our stock multiple   and how an announcement that we were putting huge dollars in Saudi  would  hurt our stock price.  Dale talked about their low multiple (between 4 and 5), noted that the market  viewed Oxy as a company that could do deals, buy and sell assets, but really  wasn't a growth company. They now have a stable cash flow, but need a  new  beach head in the Middle East to demonstrate they are growing. The point of  this conversation was to tell us that debt reduction is also a top priority  so they were also not interested in a big announcement about money being  dumped into Saudi Arabia  They characterized the Saudi perspective as being one where they are looking  for strategic partners who will be there for a long time and invest capital.  They agree on a division of labor: Oxy can do E&P, processing and  petrochemicals and look to us for pipelines and power plants although Oxy can  do those too. They realize that only Enron has the marketing, structuring   and regulatory expertise.   Casey did revisit his conversation with you about in the end Enron ends up as  some type of ""merchant banker."" That's OK in the end- Dale even said they  would take over our part of any project-- but we can't project that role  initially. We need to be on the same side of the table as Oxy.   The point here is that we have to be in step with a consistent approach to  the projects. They expect our competitors to say they'll finance things on  balance sheet and we need initially to say the same thing although later we  will open discussions on other ways to finance. Mike and I agree that this is  probably the biggest sticking point in the discussion today. Oxy believes  that such an initial statement will never be public and we aren't really  locked in an on-balance sheet approach. Maybe  we can do this, maybe we can't.  They see this as a year long process with PDA's stretching well into next  year, and 2002 when the real money would be spent. The short term crisis is   January 29 and we need a submission with lots of pages: we were criticized  that although our proposal was well thought through and technically superb,  it didn't have enough pages- reams of paper to impress  the technocrats.  We  will also need to prepare a smaller 15 page digest to be used for our  official February presentation and a three page walk around summary. Casey  thinks the production center has to be in the US.  We also all agreed that the Jan 29  questions allow us to lay out all of our  downstream concerns and establish a placeholder for issues that must be  resolved during the PDA discussions before we would do a project. I have had  the greatest success around the world when we don't try to force immediately  on a country  a perfect gas or electric market but adapt to ""local  conditions"" and implement the most important first couple of steps with the  rest to follow later. In this respect,  our projects can include suggested  regulatory concepts that if successful can be used elsewhere in the Kingdom.  Over and over we came back to the project team which they want on the ground  in Saudi.  Casey will be 100% Saudi for the foreseeable future and can make  all decisions. Who will be our lead person with the same authority? They  don't want to deal with someone who later says Houston changed it's mind ( a  little arrogant). When can we identify bodies and assignments and location?  They want full time dedicated people. Either Dale or Casey noted that the old  Enron would have parachuted a team in by now (Like South America where we  landed in a swamp and spent the next five years beating alligators over the  head with a stick). This is a very complicated political and technical  effort,. The leader has to be good at both. Casey was excited that Rob would  be assigned to the project (I guess you discussed this with him).  They both were quick to say that the working relationship to date has been  excellent and that they appreciate the effort we have put into this.  Mike committed that we would go balls to the wall for the 29th deadline, I  committed that I would designate a project team by the first week in January  (we had our first conference call yesterday), but Mike said he wanted to  think about the decision point person and process ( we aren't about to  sacrifice a deliberative strategic/consensus  thought process because they  are in a hurry).  We spent a lot of time talking about the process. We agree that the Saudi's  will eliminate one or two participants, that each project will have subparts  with different combinations and leads of companies with a master JV on top.     They minimized the capital investment although they are prepared to spent  $200-300 million over the next 3-5 years. They see core project 2 costing  $600 million, 60% Oxy/Enron assuming one other partner and Enron half of  that. We aren't talking billions (spoken like a true major).  They are sure Exxon /Mobil will be our Red Sea partner if only to earn face   with possibly Marathon as the other. Exxon is more interested in the chemical  focus which Oxy will concede to them. Mike noted was that our worst nightmare  was a partner (Exxon) who would throw away money just to have a presence).   We were assured that Oxy's only goal was to make money and if he projects  didn't, they would walk away.  The real danger in the upstream is the risk money for exploration. Oxy hopes  to hedge this risk with downstream investments (pipelines and plants) and  hopes that if the exploration is successful and reserves are added it will  lead to a whole new series of projects.  They are very proud of Oxy's role in this, claim that they were instrumental  in getting Petry Parkman and Morgan selected as advisors, that Irani is the  most respected American Arab business man and has  great access in the  Kingdom, and that they already know what investments partners are acceptable  to the Saudi's.  We  all left great friends in good Christmas spirit.  From our perspective:   Saudi is the largest economy in the Middle east and the driver in  international oil and liquids markets   Enron needs to get inside and establish relationships with the key Saudi  people. We need a foot print in the Kingdom with which to earn their  respect.  Can we do it with minimal capital investment?   Saudi is about to embark of a complete electric and gas restructuring,  regulatory included. They want the repatriation of petro dollars and dollars  held offshore by Saudi nationals.  The country can be a tremendous source of  capital.   It looks like 2001 can be managed with a minimum burn rate with the most  intense period of activity being in January. We  need to set up the team for  the January effort. I'll have this done by Jan 1. There is the question of  sorting out conflicts with other ME priorities.   Although it may be too soon to answer (we don't know yet what is possible  but we can shape that outcome), what is the end game, what do we want out of  Saudi Arabia?    We seem to have a clear division of labor and strategy with Oxy although we  need to sort out what we say about on balance sheet financing. We also need  to keep in mind that our other yet to be met partners will have a lot to say.   Oxy wants to take the lead on the Core Venture 2 (Red Sea). I agree- this is  a perfect laboratory to address all of the market structure issues that will  make the Kingdom a great place to do business.      Mike- I'm sure you can add more. Rick -it's up to you if you want to send  this around to the Saudi team.  Merry Christmas.    ",jeffrey.shankman@enron.com,mike.mcconnell@enron.com,Oxy meeting,2000-12-28 08:08:00-08:00,sent

Unfortunately, the message-taker was not efficient, thus if you could specify again your question I would be happy to research it out for you.  Please let me know.  How was your Christmas and New Years holidays?  I returned home for the holidays to Pennsylvania.  It was wonderful to visit again with family and friends.  But I will have admit it was quite shocking to arrive off the plane to a high of 6 degrees.  I guess I have become quite acclimated to the temp orate climate here in San Francisco.

I am not an expert, so you should not publish any of my  comments, but should contact an expert in the treatment of diabetes.  You quoted Mike McConnell as stating that weight gain is a normal symptom of  untreated diabetes.  My experience is that weight gain is often a CAUSE of  diabetes, whereas weight loss is often a SYMPTOM.  It would be useful to  clarify this, as some people with undiagnosed diabetes could delay seeking  help on the basis of the quotation made.  The quote ""...insulin is not a cure nor does it prevent the development of  complications.  It is merely life support.""  is totally at odds with the  experience of the diabetics I have known, and could be quite alarming to  someone recently diagnosed.  Most people on insulin need make only very small  changes to their lifestyle and diet.  Properly managed diabetes eliminates  almost all complications - the body effectively functions normally with the  addition of insulin.  damage caused prior to diagnosis can not be reversed of  course.  The suggestion that insulin is merely life support is alarming -  insulin is life support, but not ""merely"" life support.  Life can be lived  fully, and while there are probably some activities that can not be  participated in, I have not met a diabetic who has experienced this.  No  complex equipment is needed, the treatment is very quick, portable,  inconspicuous, etc.  It can not be compared to dialysis for renal failure,  for example, which is much closer to ""merely life support"".  Even so, many  people on dialysis still live good lives.  I think it would be very useful for you folks to publish something that helps  people diagnose both types of diabetes, how they can avoid the adult onset  type, and the effect on lifestyle of diabetes.  Perhaps you could find some  nice statistics such as the most common method of diagnosis is when the  patient goes into a comma due to high blood sugar (at least in some  countries), diabetes is the leading cause of non-accidental amputations,  adult blindness, renal failure, etc, and that the materials for a blood test  cost about $1.  yours  Tom Halliburton     ",mary.clark@enron.com,mike.mcconnell@enron.com,Re: Enron Business on diabetes,2001-01-05 05:43:00-08:00,sent

We founded the firm over one year ago, and things have been going  quite well.  However, the landscape for our business model, industry market penetration,  as well as increased competition has eroded the chance for strong revenue  success of this company, and I wish to return to Enron, but staying within  the dynamic, challenging high-tech areas, such as Enron Global Markets.  My responsibilities here at Chematch.com have been multiple-fold.? I have  been directly responsible for the creation of the business strategy/plan (and  its changes), the pro-forma financial statements and projections that  permutate with the strategy, key strategic alliances with best of breed  industry participants, venture capital raising process for three series of  funding, the Investment Banking presentations/diligence/IPO work.  I currently head up all of the Chematch.com content, information and  analytics efforts, for both cash and paper markets.? I also head up  Petrochem.net, the sister company within Chematch.com.

A win by Switzer would mean the two men would be dead even. He won.  Bud Wilkinson was replaced by his defensive coordinator, Gomer Jones, who had a difficult time replacing a legend, and was replaced by Jim Mackenzie.

The Brazilian=20 government is likely to release its 2001-2002 forecast in December or Janua= ry=20 2001.  The 1999 plantings garnered expectations of a 2001-2002 crop yield o= f=20 44-46 million bags.  However, recent weather problems have caused a=20 significant downgrade of this forecast to between 33 and 40 million bags.  Other sources in contact with coffee growers in Brazil report the potential= =20 for even greater damage to the 2001-2002 crop, in the range of up to a 50= =20 percent drop, or 22-23 million bags.  Agronomists from Cooxupe, the largest= =20 coffee cooperative in Brazil, have already pegged their first estimate at= =20 27.8 million bags.  Again, however, it is critical to remember that growers= =20 tend to exaggerate weather damage, which is then further exacerbated by=20 market rumors.

A shortage of significant rainfall between now and the= =20 end of December could bring yield down to a 30 percent loss from the=20 forecast, in the range of 33-36 million bags.

"Virginia,  Hello.  I was originally inquiring about purchasing a Cross or Signac  impressionist lithograph.  I found them and purchased both from a gallery in  London, William Weston.  They should be delivered this week.  They are  beautiful and will add a lot to our collection.  By the way the Lichtenstein  is up and hanging in our formal living room and it is magnificent.  I have  also purchased an Appel in the last month.  I am interested in several artists.  Actually, a lot.  I will be looking for  one or more of the following.  My concept is that overtime I would like to  own one of all the following artists and they are all depending when I find  something that we really like.  I listed all of our (sometimes mine vs. my  wife's favorites and priorities).  They are kind of in rank order but as I  stated if I find the piece that I like we will purchase it.  I want signed  and numbered.  I realize that some were not signed by the artist but it is an  important fact in my buying decision.  I also realize that some may not have  done any works on paper or they are outrageously expensive.  For example, I  would like to know if Rothko or Kline did any work on paper.    At least that is what I am thinking now.  Bonnard (colorful only) Lautrec Suerat (any works on paper? - I don't know that he did any) Other impressionist or post impressionist lithos Braque Moore Arp Rouault Modrian Rothko Kline Motherwell  By the way, I am interested in re-looking at a Picasso (although we have 2)  that your gallery had a couple of years ago.  It was a cubist piece from the  1920s and I believe you called the technique a ""push wa"" (pronunciation Vs an  attempt at the proper spelling).  It was for sale in a couple of galleries in  SF and was about $20,000.  Is there 1 available?  Also I am still thinking  about the Matisse we discussed before but as you can see, I have a lot of  other artists I am interested in and it may remain on the back burner because  we already have one.

Enron  has suspended work to close  project financing and we have significantly reduced the MetGas staff.  The  Team will focus on completing the acquisition of all major permits and  clearances over the next few weeks.  The go forward plan is to either package  MetGas ""as is"" and sell it off or use it as leverage in the negotiation of  the DPC workout with the Indian government.    I will be relocating from India back to Houston  in the near future.  In  anticipation of this relocation I am exploring possible job opportunities  within the Enron family of companies.    I believe I can add value to your team's efforts in developing the LNG  projects in both Venezuela and the Bahamas.  I have experience related to  both projects and I can hit the ground running.   In addition, I bring prior  ECT experience and success as a deal maker / originator, extensive experience  in LNG including the development of production facilities, regasification and  related harbour facilities and experience negotiating LNG Sale & Purchase  Agreements as both a buyer or seller. Coupled to this experience is my  knowledge of what it takes to structure assets and the pertinent commercial  documents such that the asset can be project financed.

We expect the case to  go to court in the fourth quarter of this year.  As I previously advised, Kinder Morgan has been very patient with us during  this process.  At some point in time we will have to address their claims,  which by definition will have to go through us in order to reach Sempra.  Let me know if I can provide any additional information.

"Yesterday's meeting in Bombay among OLNG, DPC and Denton Hall (OLNG's lawyer)  went very well.  DPC did a great job of describing the current situation in a  balanced manner (yes, there are both positives and negatives).  OLNG was  pleased with the information they received.  One concept that became apparent is that there may be two agendas within  Oman----(a) OLNG's agenda, which is to cooperate to make the project a  success, even if it involves some renegotiation and (b) Shell's agenda, which  may be to force the project into default to create an opportunity for Shell  to step in and take control of the only LNG terminal that will be built on  the west coast of India in the foreseeable future.  The Omani government is contemplating a visit to Delhi to initiate  government-to-government talks to help sort this out.  Dabhol is one of  several projects that Oman had hoped would successfully build ties with  India---and each of the projects has run into snags because India has not  held up its end of the deal.  I had seperate talks with Wade/Jim about the forward path within Enron.  The  three of us believe that DPC should consider either going short LNG or  replacing at least a portion of its LNG contracts with an EGM supply  contract, with EGM deciding what to do about coverage (i.e., short or long).  On a separate note, I met today with the head of Adgas in Abu Dhabi to  explain the status of DPC.  They are happy that we are keeping them informed  of potential problems, even though there has not been any default under their  contract with DPC/MSEB.  At the end of the meeting, they volunteered their  willingness to work with Enron to re-deploy the DPC cargoes if needed.  They  recognize that pricing may have to change to accomplish this.

This will  not be talk but we will get these people in place by specific deadlines.  We  will pay all of those people's expenses and they will be on board with the  hiring and will be expected to be a valuable team player and resource to  their group.  On the Norway front, we need to implement the same organization structure.   We have talked a lot about Thor and better communication, but we need to make  a change.  We will have weekly calls with him and the weather group to make  sure that we are all on the same page and he is up to speed with where we are  going.  Jeff did have a video call with Thor to talk about his email and it  went well.  Upon my return I learned that Thor and the London group put out a  press release about putting out pricing on 1,000 cities and even changing the  index.  Neither Mark or Jeff were even aware of this event nor was it even  brought up in the call as something that was going to happen.  Also the  hiring of xxxxxx as a weather  originator, without any discussion, also  illustrates the lack of communication or desire to work together.  I am not  saying that Mark or Thor are totally to blame, they both deserve credit for  not working together, but  we are going to change the future and make sure  that it will work better.  I know that all of Thor's group is very loyal to  Thor and may not want to transition into EGM and if that is the case, we can  make it work via London.  I think the key is our approach to Thor and that  this isn't meant as a reflection on him but is a consistent change with how  we are running all of our businesses around the world.  The weather piece of  his business is very small and isn't going to effect his P&L significantly  (he'll actually be net positive!)  Please give me a call and we will discuss the issues surrounding this new  structure and the best way to communicate it to those involved to make this  the most effective.  This email is going just to you and Jeff and won't be shared with anyone else.  mike ",jeffrey.shankman@enron.com,mike.mcconnell@enron.com,Weather organization,2001-02-21 03:18:00-08:00,sent

SHEA TELEPHONE (281) 367-5955 FAX (281) 292-7905   February 22, 2001  Via e-mail  Mr. & Mrs. Mike McConnell 13451 Belhaven Drive Houston, TX  77069  RE: Proposed Unimproved Property Contract by and between Flair Construction Co., Inc., as Seller, and Mike and Chris McConnell, as Buyer  Dear Mike:  We have read and reviewed the above referenced Contract and your letter to us regarding same dated February 20, 2001.  We want to respond to the questions and issues raised in your letter as well as make some suggestions and comments about the proposed Contract itself.  First, the Contract being used is the standard type of Contract used for the proposed transaction.  The Contract is promulgated by the Texas Real Estate Commission and is to be used by all licensed Real Estate Brokers and Agents. We are interested in knowing, however, if the Contract was filled out by Mr. Larry Williams of Prudential Gary Greene Realtors.  If so, does Mr. Williams represent you or Flair Construction Co., Inc.?  Please advise us accordingly.  As we discussed, we think it is most important that you have the opportunity to read and review the Construction Agreement that Flair Construction Co., Inc. intends on using for the construction of your home.  The fact that Flair is both the Developer, as well as the potential Builder, raises some issues.  Usually, Builders have agreements with the Developer regarding the purchase of lots and building on same.  Often, lots are reserved to certain Builders and if you purchase those lots you are required to use the designated Builders.  However, often lots are free to be purchased by potential homeowners who then can choose the Builder they want.  We are interested in knowing if the lots you are purchasing are actually reserved to Flair Construction Co. Inc., or is Flair just requiring you to use them to build your home since they are selling you the lots in question?  As you point out in your letter, if you sign the Contract as it now reads, you are captive to the Builder and are not free to negotiate with other Builders.  It appears to us that you will be one of the first homeowners in this new subdivision.  We think it is critically important that you get a copy of the Deed Restrictions even before you sign the Contract to make sure that there are restrictions in place regarding the size of homes to be built, size of lots, etc.  We want to make sure that your home is not horribly atypical for the neighborhood.  We do not know if The Lakes of Sterling Gate Estates is in the City of Houston or within its extraterritorial jurisdiction.  This is something you may want to find out as soon as possible.  If it is outside the city limits, is there already a MUD district in place to provide water and sewer services?  Since this is a brand new subdivision your concern regarding its future development and tax rate is very legitimate.  Usually, until the subdivision is fairly well built out, the Developer controls the Community Association as well as the Architectural Control Committee.  Therefore, if this subdivision does not take off you will be under the control of the Developer.  We recommend in the strongest terms possible that you talk with recent customers of Flair Construction Co. Inc., to make sure that they were happy with the construction of their homes, as well as warranty work.  Some Builders are far better than others as it relates to follow-up warranty work after their customers move into their homes.  We normally recommend that homeowners do not move into their homes until all punch list items are completed to the satisfaction of the homeowner.  The foregoing was our general comments regarding the proposed Contract.  We will now make more specific comments and suggestions in chronological order regarding the Contract:  1. Paragraph 2. PROPERTY.  As we previously stated, we think it is important that you acquire copies of the Restrictive Covenants and Deed Restrictions as soon as possible.  You will be responsible to pay assessments to the Property Owners Association.  Since Flair is both the Builder and Developer, you may want to ask Mr. Kent for an estimate of what your Community Association Fees will be.  2. Paragraph 5. EARNEST MONEY.  We suggest that the earnest money be paid to the Title Company and not to Flair Construction Co. Inc.  3. Paragraph 6. TITLE POLICY AND SURVEY.  (6)  The standard printed exception as to discrepancies, conflicts, shortages in area or boundary lines, encroachments or protrusions or overlapping improvements is in your Owners Policy.  In other words, the title policy does not cover these types of discrepancies or conflicts.  However, if a survey is completed and an additional fifteen percent (15%) of the policy premium is paid, the title company will probably delete this exception.  This is something you may want to consider.  However, this cost would be yours to incur.  If, however, it is subsequently discovered that there are such discrepancies and conflicts or shortages, then you will have title insurance coverage accordingly.  4. Paragraph 6. TITLE POLICY AND SURVEY, last paragraph.  Make sure you are provided a copy of the Commitment for Title Insurance as soon as possible.  5. Paragraph 6. TITLE POLICY AND SURVEY B (3).  It appears to us that the only survey you will be provided with by the Seller is one for the new recorded plat of the subdivision.  Therefore, the Seller is not providing you a survey of your actual lots.  If you were to have the standard printed exception as to discrepancies and conflicts deleted, we believe you would need a survey of your lots.  You will have seven (7) days after you receive the Commitment and/or the survey to object in writing to any matters disclosed or you will be deemed to waive such objections accordingly. Therefore, please make sure that we have the opportunity to review the survey and commitment as soon as possible after you receive same.  6. Paragraph 6. TITLE POLICY AND SURVEY (6).  We agree that this paragraph relating to the Sellers right to continue to show the property for sale should be deleted.  7. Paragraph 7. PROPERTY CONDITION: B (1).  We suggest that this paragraph be checked and utilized rather than paragraph 7B (2) which states that you will be accepting the property in its present condition.  Paragraph 7B (1) states that you will pay a fee, usually very small, like $100.00, for the unrestricted right to terminate the contract in the event the property is not suitable for the purposes for which you intend on using it.  In other words, you can have whatever inspectors you deem necessary to look at the property to make sure that it is satisfactory for your home construction. We often suggest that an independent inspector be hired by the homeowner to inspect and review the construction of the home as it progresses.  In addition, there may be some environmental issues or soil condition questions that an inspector might raise if given the opportunity.  As the Contract now reads, you are simply accepting the property as is and have no right to send an inspector out to the property accordingly.  8. Paragraph 8. BROKERS' FEES.  You may want an affirmative statement that you as the Buyer will not be responsible for or pay any Brokers' fees.  9. Paragraph 11. SPECIAL PROVISIONS.  It is written in that the closing on these lots will be as soon as roads are in place or on March 1, 2001, whichever is later.  However, we do not know what roads are being addressed and think that this sentence needs far more specificity.  The second sentence regarding your obligation to use Flair Homes has already been addressed earlier.  The third sentence regarding when construction must start should be revised to give you more time as you make reference in your letter.  However, we also suggest that the Builder be put under an obligation to start construction within thirty (30) days after the date you notify him that you are ready for construction to begin.  10. Paragraph 13. ROLLBACK TAXES.  If there was ever an agricultural or timber exemption on this property, you need to know.  Otherwise, you will be obligated to pay rollback taxes on the property which may go back five (5) years.  11. Paragraph 18. ESCROW.  As we indicated earlier, we believe your earnest money should be paid to the title company.  In light of the fact that the earnest money is in excess of $50,000.00 and the closing date on the lots is somewhat uncertain, we suggest that you ask the title company to deposit the earnest money in an interest bearing account and that you receive a credit accordingly.  Please call us after you read and review this letter.         Very truly yours,           Donald S.

"Dear Mike:  On Friday, February 23, 2001 we received by fax a copy of the Residential Construction Contract Mr. Kent intends on using in connection with the construction of your home.  Upon receipt we noticed that it was not a Cost Plus Contract.  Therefore, we spoke with him about this matter.  He indicated that although he believes he will be doing the home on a cost plus basis, no final agreement regarding this matter had yet been made.  The Residential Construction Contract form he uses is a Greater Houston Builders Association form which is, for the most part, a good one although it is written primarily to protect the builder.  Therefore, we may ask that a number of minor changes be made to the Contract as it relates to notice requirements to you regarding problems in construction and some changes in the indemnity language.  In addition, there may be some other changes we request.  Under any circumstance, we can dictate a letter to Mr. Kent at the appropriate time.  Mr. Kent also indicated that he will make sure we receive a copy of the Deed Restrictions as soon as possible.  We assume that you will acquire financing for the construction of the home itself.  When you close, Flair Construction Co., Inc. will also have to provide to you a Disclosure Statement which spells out some of your rights and responsibilities under Texas law and a Contractors List of Subcontractors and Suppliers which tells you the names and addresses of the Subcontractors Flair intends on using.  We are sure that the construction lender will require that these documents be provided at the appropriate time.

"Cheryl,  Thanks for the update.  I like the progress.  I realize that we can not cover us 100% for the future contract but at least  it will help.  What I think we need is some way to protect us incase he gives  us a very high bid price to build the house  because we are captive.  What do  you suggest as a possible remedy?  Some sort of checks on allowing others to  bid?   Some sort of out on re-purchasing the lot at a set price?  Without a  cost plus methodology we could be very vulnerable here.  What do you think?  A few of the other issues you addressed in the earlier fax.  2. Earnest money:  I like putting it in title company vs. Flair.   3. Title policy:  Lets go ahead and take the additional coverage, I think it  is prudent especially with the new subdivision. How much does an additional  15% cost?  I don't have any idea. 4.  have provided 5.  not sure i understand this 6.  yes, delete  7. definitely change and check b1 and hire an inspector 8. add in clarifying statement 9. agree to add builder obligation.  I am fine with a quick closing date and  needs specificity.  Does he have an estimated time of completion? 10.

Upon receipt we noticed that it was not a Cost Plus Contract.  Therefore, we spoke with him about this matter.  He indicated that although he believes he will be doing the home on a cost plus basis, no final agreement regarding this matter had yet been made.  The Residential Construction Contract form he uses is a Greater Houston Builders Association form which is, for the most part, a good one although it is written primarily to protect the builder.  Therefore, we may ask that a number of minor changes be made to the Contract as it relates to notice requirements to you regarding problems in construction and some changes in the indemnity language.  In addition, there may be some other changes we request.  Under any circumstance, we can dictate a letter to Mr. Kent at the appropriate time.  Mr. Kent also indicated that he will make sure we receive a copy of the Deed Restrictions as soon as possible.  We assume that you will acquire financing for the construction of the home itself.  When you close, Flair Construction Co., Inc. will also have to provide to you a Disclosure Statement which spells out some of your rights and responsibilities under Texas law and a Contractors List of Subcontractors and Suppliers which tells you the names and addresses of the Subcontractors Flair intends on using.  We are sure that the construction lender will require that these documents be provided at the appropriate time.  Should you have any questions or comments, please call us.

I am currently a Development Support Manager with  EES in the Integrated Asset Management (IAM).   Recently, I  had the good  fortune to meet, Ron Hosmer.  He represents a company called IdleAire  Technologies, Inc..  IdleAire is a startup company started in 1999.    IdleAire has developed a system to eliminate truckdrivers from having to idle  their trucks while on long haul overnight stops.  Their plan is to electrify  truckstops and install remote HVAC units to eliminate truck idling.  Also,  these units provide cable TV and internet services.  They have already  piloted the technology in several truckstops in the Knoxville, TN area.  IdleAire's  goal is to:   ""........evolve the nation's truck stops and travel centers into the largest  truck stop electrification network in the world. We are taking truck stop  electrification to the next level. Our travel center conversions provide  heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) at every parking space. We  also provide drivers in-cab telephone, Internet and television.""  Idle Air has caught the attention of many interest groups in Washington,  D.C.  Ron tells me that they have already gained support from Tennessee  congressmen, including Jimmy Duncan and  Van Hilleary.   Also, former House  Speaker, Newt Gingrich is on the board of directors of IdleAire  Technologies.  These individuals support this technology because it reduces  emissions and helps state quality for CMAQ funds.    I had mentioned to Ron, that I worked for Enron and informed him about what  we do.  He and I both felt that Enron may be interested in developing a  strategic partnership to take their technology to market.   Ron said that  they are looking for a strategic partner with energy related experience and  the capital to invest in this project.    Enron would benefit in several ways:  1.  Greater than average returns.  2.  Increased publicity and recognition in Enron's environmental role.  (EPA  Energy Star Label, EPA Climate Protection Award, etc....)   3.  Increase markets for electricity and possibly gas.  4.  Maintain Enron's title of innovation leader.  5.  Open a whole new market the energy services group. (EES)  I believe this opportunity is very synergistic with Enron's business model.   If you would be interested in talking with Ron, I would be happy to introduce  him to you.  They have a  very comprehensive business plan that lays out  their business in detail.   I have arranged for him to provide us with an  executive summary of the business.  You can also find out more about the  company by visiting their website at:  www.idleaire.com  Thanks for your time.

"I've pulled together some general ideas on marketing within ENE and how it  would ideally be structured for GRM.  Marketing & Origination Model  For GRM, our success is entirely dependent on a developing a team of  dedicated marketers who specialize in delivering insurance risk management  solutions to clients. The business model is a risk aggregation play  (gathering first loss and co-share pieces of insurable risks we understand).  We risk impairing our ability to create a portfolio of risks that can be  managed, repackaged and placed in the capital or insurance markets at large  if we don't have direct influence over the deal flow being generated. To  accomplish this my ideal marketing/origination model working with other Enron  business units would be:  Client Originator: Centralized in a long term origination team in ENA, EGM,  EIM (as opposed to midmarket function) with industry specific expertise, e.g.  oil    & gas, power, coal, forest products, etc. The CO would be responsible  for maximizing client profitability for Enron in an investment banking  capacity, making sure we have an inside track to the client's strategic  initiatives/business opportunities and making sure we package complete  solutions using  all ENE product areas. The CO also needs a financial  incentive (see below) to take responsibility for making sure each individual  product area is servicing the client where possible, particularly when a  package solution is not viable, e.g like outsourcing. The CO should be  involved with all product marketing calls if possible, but would not act as  gate keeper, rather act more as a control valve creating a steady flow of  ideas, products and services to the client.  Product Marketer: Centralized in a product marketing team, with industry  knowledge and product specific expertise. While the PM will call on clients  for      independent origination of new business opportunities, ideally the  bulk of the opportunities should be marketing to clients identified by the CM  to have a need for GRM's products or services. The marketing is done in  partnership with the CO, but the driver of the transaction would be the PM.  Execution would be handle by the PM's business unit with a portion of  revenues devoted to the CO for their origination of the opportunity. However,  if a particular group or CO  does not play ball or does not generate any  business leads, the PM would still be free to originate business  independently.  Shared Resources Centralized in a group like Fundamentals, Research, Weather  Desk, etc. Especially useful in upstream where the deals require extensive     engineering work and technical support. We currently use Walt Hamilton,  Senior Reserve Engineer who works for Craig Fox in Enron Capital Resources,  not full-time but nearly full time. Once we have a few deals booked, an  engineer will also need to maintain the position by reviewing the reserves on  a regular basis. I would envision having Walt on our payroll, working for us  but remaining part of a resource pool that could be shared depending on deal  flow and priorities set by Craig.   Shared P&L  Tough to implement, but unless there is a real financial  incentive, CO's will naturally focus on deals they originate and the earnings  stay in their group.  I've worked with splits ranging from 80/20 if we do all  the work and it is a simple referral, to 50/50 if the transaction opportunity  is further developed by the time we get involved, typically as part of a  structured package solution.  This is best case, but in case you're wondering, I haven't lost my senses.  Enron is not currently the ideal company to take this approach and I don't  believe GRM is the ideal guinea pig to make the change. Some hybrid solution  is probably better for us, tailoring the effort based on the particular group  we work with. In the case of EGM business units, I think this is the way to  go since we can influence our own people. In the case of ENA or other Enron  companies, we need to be more selective, with the worst case being we go it  alone and duplicate efforts. This is the path we're on today with ECR's  upstream business, however it is not how we are proceeding with EIM where we  are trying to build bridges with forest products and steel, or ENA's power  desk, where we have the double trigger product for them to market.  Soap Box  A little background and my general view of marketing at Enron after nearly 3  years here. In my banking career I've worked both as a relationship manager,  marketing all the bank's product areas to a targeted client base, as well as  a product specialist working with a relationship manager to service that  client base and execute product specific business. Our competitors, whether  investment banks or commercial banks, seemed to have a similar setup,  although they varied in design from broad geographical marketing assignments  to industry specific assignments.  For me, this type of marketing and  origination setup was easy to leverage, meaning my product specialist teams  could hire the best and remain small and efficient.  Enron is the first company I've worked for that doesn't have a coordinated  origination and  marketing approach to clients. Instead, the culture here is  clearly based on free access to all clients, i.e. no gate keepers, no  ownership of the client and hence no one individual accountable for  maximizing the profitability of business closed with a client. Several  different product/trading areas can all call on the same client with little  or no coordination and have no game plan to maximize profitability. A clear  benefit of not having relationship managers is speed to market with new  products and new ideas combined with specialist knowledge about the product  or service being sold. (In fact, I believe this has been a direct contributor  to our ranking as the most innovative company in America.) A clear drawback  is duplication of effort and weak implementation of cross-selling.....given  lip-service by most marketing and origination teams I have worked with.  Nevertheless, given Enron's successful track record, it appears the benefits  outweigh the drawbacks and it is a system I've comfortably adjusted to.  Enough of the soap box. Just wanted to share my general Enron marketing  thoughts and a little of my bias.  I don't know if this was specific enough for you so let me know if you need  more detail. Consider this part of a dialogue.  New Name?  I'm also exploring alternative names for the group that identify our role  more readily.  What do you think of the name Insurance Risk Management Group  or Insurance Risk Management Solutions?   The latter ties into Enron's new  way of describing its business activities...Logistical Solutions. I met with  Dennis Vegas to discuss branding and general marketing of our activities and  he said Logistical Solutions will be in our annual report and a major theme  going forward.   Hope you had a nice holiday. Speak to you next week.  Per",mike.mcconnell@enron.com,per.sekse@enron.com,GRM Marketing & Origination,2001-03-16 11:04:00-08:00,received

In a meeting between Jeff Skilling and President Chavez in late-2000 (I  was in the meeting), Jeff invited Chavez to Enron Field as our guess.  Obviously, Chavez was only visiting the city for a just hours and I believe  the season started just a few days later. In any case, we have already done  some previous lobby to get President Chavez to the Stadium. This may help  whoever is managing the contant with the Astros (probably David T.). I will probably not get much additional input from Caracas. Nevertheless, I  strongly suggest that we position Enron as close as we can to this  opportunity (we will later see if President Chavez actually make it to  Houston); 2. In addition, in previous trips to Houston and in several ocassions, I  believe Chavez has always met with George Bush senior and Mr. Mosbacher. I  would not be surprised if he do it again. Probably your team can also target  these efforts and keep the action at all fronts; Please keep me informed. I would like to be involved as much as possible to  move this ahead.

This will mean that we will repay to the CATS parties  approximately $150 million plus interest and court costs, putting the final  figure at an estimated $155-160 million.  We expect to be invoiced for the  principal amount in the next week or so; sorting costs and interest may take  as long as 60 days.  The written opinion reflects a determination on the part  of the Lords to rule against us regardless of what the contract says.  The  opinion seeks to conclude ""what rational businessmen could have intended""  rather than applying the provisions of the contract.    For example, Lord Hoffman (author of the primary opinion) makes it clear that  the  ""retrospective consequences"" of discovering a latent defect after  payments have been made (and would therefore need to be refunded) are  unacceptable.  His view seems to be that because we were not ready to flow  J-Block gas during the period of the T-6 leak, we are not damaged and  therefore not entitled to relief under the contract.  Furthermore, he says  that the Commencement Date notice sent by the CATS parties was in the nature  of a declaration and as long as it is sent in good faith it is effective.  As far as the price reduction formula in Clause 7.5, Lord Hoffman opines that  the clause is not operative until TGTL had tied in the J-Block field.  The  contract makes no reference to this requirement.  Hoffman's view is that it  is only upon tie-in that the CATS parties' obligation to provide the  Transportation Service is triggered and therefore there can be no price  reduction for not providing the service unless tie-in is complete. This  statement is in stark contrast with Hoffman's earlier statement in the  opinion that upon the giving of the Commencement Date notice the CATS parties  have an absolute obligation to provide the Transportation Service.  Equally disappointing and surprising is the fact that the Lords rejected our  submission for reimbursement of our costs incurred in connection with the  restitution issue.  As you may recall, restitution was the primary issue upon  which the CATS parties obtained leave to appeal, and they conceded the point  at the commencement of the hearing.  Reimbursement of these costs should have  been a given.   Although I have not yet been able to speak to our most senior barrister, our  other counsel have assessed the opinion as ""appalling"" and ""pathetic,"" and  describe the situation as one where Enron has been ""stitched up"".   Unfortunately, given that this is the court of last resort in this country  (except of course the Court of Human Rights), there is not an avenue for  recourse.  In conclusion may I say that although we did not get the result we wanted or  expected from the House of Lords, I very much appreciate all the support from  each of you for these past six years.  The case has been a roller coaster  ride;  I hope our earlier victory in the Court of Appeal will evidence in  fact that some tribunals in this country recognize that we did get it right.   Please call me if you wish to discuss the case in any further detail, or if  you wish to have a copy of the opinion.  My telephone number is 011 44 207  783 6582.  Many thanks.

You may find our conclusions of interest. Best regards,  Bob Nimocks  President  Zeus Development Corporation  www.zeusdevelopment.com  2424 Wilcrest Dr., Suite 250  Houston, TX 77042  Direct: 713-952-9529  Main: 888-GR8-DATA (478-3282)  e-mail: bnimocks@zeusdevelopment.com   ***********************************  TITLE:  LNG's Role in North American & Caribbean Gas Supply  DATE/LOCATION:  Washington D.C., June 27-29  SUMMARY:  The winter of 2000/2001 confirmed the shift in the United States  from a buyer's to a seller's market. Gas supplies for North America ran short  as demand rose from colder weather, higher electricity demand and shortages  in storage from the previous year.  More and more supply is shifting from the  U.S. Gulf Coast to Western Canada as offshore exploration in the Gulf of  Mexico has proven disappointing.  U.S. demand for power generation is  expected to keep gas demand high through the summer of 2001, siphoning off  gas that would have been destined for storage.   Meanwhile during the long gas bubble of the 1980s, drilling rigs and  experienced field personnel dwindled from thousands to several hundred.  The  current rig count for North American gas exploration and production is near  full capacity at just over 600 rigs, so the industry is constrained on how  quickly it can recover.   The U.S. has not experienced shortages of natural gas like this since the  1970s and early 1980s when it was feared that the nation would run out of gas  in 10 years.  Four LNG import terminals were built to supply natural gas from  North Africa (Algeria).  These terminals are capable of supplying up to 5% of  total U.S. gas consumption (about one trillion cubic feet per year).  Plans  are underway to have all four terminals fully operational by the end of 2002;  however, more are needed.   Conventional wisdom is that no new terminals would be built in the United  States due to EPA laws and local citizen protests to any facility perceived  to be unsightly or dangerous.  Now, El Paso (a company that was burned by  Congress in the 1980s by the ruling that take-or-pay LNG contracts with  Algeria were invalid) is challenging conventional wisdom. They have announced  plans for six new terminals to be built in North America: three in the United  States and three in Mexico.    New LNG plants in Venezuela, Algeria and  Northern Australia might supply these terminals.  Other companies, such as Enron and AEC, have announced plans to build  terminals in the Caribbean to supply gas to independent power production  (IPP) plants ranging from 400 to 1000 megawatts.  Moreover, LNG facilities on  Caribbean Islands close to Florida might export gas or electricity via  undersea pipeline and cable.  Floating offshore LNG terminals may also offer  a means to bring LNG into the United States with less environmental and  community concern.   The June 27-29 conference, entitled ""LNG's Role in North American & Caribbean  Gas Supply,"" will cover the dynamics that are leading to North American gas  supply shortages, how long they are expected to last, and what source of  natural gas are available from conventional sources to meet demand.  The  conference will then focus on opportunities for LNG, including the capacities  and timing of current terminals, the prospects for new mainland and offshore  terminals, and the opportunity for broader terminal networks in the  Caribbean, including those facilities that might supply gas or electricity to  the United States.   * * *  ",eric.gonzales@enron.com,mike.mcconnell@enron.com,LNG's Role in North American & Caribbean Gas Supply,2001-04-09 05:27:00-07:00,sent

This will mean that we will repay to the CATS parties approximately $150 million plus interest and court costs, putting the final figure at an estimated $155-160 million.  We expect to be invoiced for the principal amount in the next week or so; sorting costs and interest may take as long as 60 days.  The written opinion reflects a determination on the part of the Lords to rule against us regardless of what the contract says.  The opinion seeks to conclude ""what rational businessmen could have intended"" rather than applying the provisions of the contract.    For example, Lord Hoffman (author of the primary opinion) makes it clear that the  ""retrospective consequences"" of discovering a latent defect after payments have been made (and would therefore need to be refunded) are unacceptable.  His view seems to be that because we were not ready to flow J-Block gas during the period of the T-6 leak, we are not damaged and therefore not entitled to relief under the contract.  Furthermore, he says that the Commencement Date notice sent by the CATS parties was in the nature of a declaration and as long as it is sent in good faith it is effective.  As far as the price reduction formula in Clause 7.5, Lord Hoffman opines that the clause is not operative until TGTL had tied in the J-Block field.  The contract makes no reference to this requirement.  Hoffman's view is that it is only upon tie-in that the CATS parties' obligation to provide the Transportation Service is triggered and therefore there can be no price reduction for not providing the service unless tie-in is complete. This statement is in stark contrast with Hoffman's earlier statement in the opinion that upon the giving of the Commencement Date notice the CATS parties have an absolute obligation to provide the Transportation Service.  Equally disappointing and surprising is the fact that the Lords rejected our submission for reimbursement of our costs incurred in connection with the restitution issue.  As you may recall, restitution was the primary issue upon which the CATS parties obtained leave to appeal, and they conceded the point at the commencement of the hearing.  Reimbursement of these costs should have been a given.   Although I have not yet been able to speak to our most senior barrister, our other counsel have assessed the opinion as ""appalling"" and ""pathetic,"" and describe the situation as one where Enron has been ""stitched up"".  Unfortunately, given that this is the court of last resort in this country (except of course the Court of Human Rights), there is not an avenue for recourse.  In conclusion may I say that although we did not get the result we wanted or expected from the House of Lords, I very much appreciate all the support from each of you for these past six years.  The case has been a roller coaster ride;  I hope our earlier victory in the Court of Appeal will evidence in fact that some tribunals in this country recognize that we did get it right.

Gas supplies for North America ran short  as demand rose from colder weather, higher electricity demand and shortages  in storage from the previous year.  More and more supply is shifting from the  U.S. Gulf Coast to Western Canada as offshore exploration in the Gulf of  Mexico has proven disappointing.  U.S. demand for power generation is  expected to keep gas demand high through the summer of 2001, siphoning off  gas that would have been destined for storage.   Meanwhile during the long gas bubble of the 1980s, drilling rigs and  experienced field personnel dwindled from thousands to several hundred.  The  current rig count for North American gas exploration and production is near  full capacity at just over 600 rigs, so the industry is constrained on how  quickly it can recover.   The U.S. has not experienced shortages of natural gas like this since the  1970s and early 1980s when it was feared that the nation would run out of gas  in 10 years.  Four LNG import terminals were built to supply natural gas from  North Africa (Algeria).  These terminals are capable of supplying up to 5% of  total U.S. gas consumption (about one trillion cubic feet per year).  Plans  are underway to have all four terminals fully operational by the end of 2002;  however, more are needed.   Conventional wisdom is that no new terminals would be built in the United  States due to EPA laws and local citizen protests to any facility perceived  to be unsightly or dangerous.  Now, El Paso (a company that was burned by  Congress in the 1980s by the ruling that take-or-pay LNG contracts with  Algeria were invalid) is challenging conventional wisdom. They have announced  plans for six new terminals to be built in North America: three in the United  States and three in Mexico.    New LNG plants in Venezuela, Algeria and  Northern Australia might supply these terminals.  Other companies, such as Enron and AEC, have announced plans to build  terminals in the Caribbean to supply gas to independent power production  (IPP) plants ranging from 400 to 1000 megawatts.  Moreover, LNG facilities on  Caribbean Islands close to Florida might export gas or electricity via  undersea pipeline and cable.  Floating offshore LNG terminals may also offer  a means to bring LNG into the United States with less environmental and  community concern.   The June 27-29 conference, entitled ""LNG's Role in North American & Caribbean  Gas Supply,"" will cover the dynamics that are leading to North American gas  supply shortages, how long they are expected to last, and what source of  natural gas are available from conventional sources to meet demand.  The  conference will then focus on opportunities for LNG, including the capacities  and timing of current terminals, the prospects for new mainland and offshore  terminals, and the opportunity for broader terminal networks in the  Caribbean, including those facilities that might supply gas or electricity to  the United States.   * * *   ",bnimocks@zeusdevelopment.com,mike.mcconnell@enron.com,Re: Introduction to Eric Gonzales,2001-04-25 10:12:00-07:00,sent

The reason why I called is that I have some questions that I will like your  input on before I take a decision. I will try to call you later today but  here are some of the questions.  You and Jeff talks about a senior position for me. What do you mean by that  and what will Joe's position be. Will he still be the ""president"" or will he  take a more active role on the origination side. What will Jeremy's role be.  Today he does all these senior structuring deals with EGM products.  Focus. There are very many commodities to look at here but since we have  limited resources at this stage we need some focus in the beginning. If we  look at everything at once - nothing will happen.  There are two areas that looks ""easy"" to start with. Softs and Liquids. How  willing are EGM to focus on these in the beginning. The reason for I call  these areas ""easy"" is that there are big and very liquid liquids and soft  markets here and it therefore will possible to do transactions early to get  some momentum in the business. The other markets have large potential but  will take much longer time to develop. I look at Equity/FX/Interest as  something Darren will continue focus on.  When some of these markets start to develop and we will have some marketing  activities/trading going on where will the books probably be and to whom will  we report. If we do Softs will it be to Gary or will it be to Jeff. How will  it be integrated. I have no problem with say reporting liquids etc to John  Nowlan, Softs to Gary, weather to Mark. I think this will be a good solution  because it will force them to follow us up and it will be easier to  communicate strategies back and forth etc. The situation today on weather is  something that I do not like. We have the book, but we do not have any real  support from Houston or real responsibility. If that is the situation we will  soon have a lot of problems. It is not a secret within Enron that the  Singapore oil situation, coal in Asia/Australia and the weather in  Scandinavia/Europe are not optimal. For me to take a decision I will need to  know that there are support and willingness from all the heads of EGMs  different commodities for developing the possibilities in this region, not  only from you and Jeff. I do not want to use all my time fighting internal  battles, but I know that it will be hard work to make a business grow.  Staff. In my power trading group today I have 2 managers and 9 AAs. The  managers + 2 Asso are what I call marketing guys and the rest are analysts  (some with trading potential). We have no one with trading background in EGM  products so that need to be recruited. At the same time many of these AAs  have started within the last 6 months so they are not fully Enronized so it  would be a good idea to send over some AAs or managers to teach people models  etc.   You mentioned Singapore in the TC, what will happen with them?  How does EGM reward people for starting up businesses. It was almost  impossible to get someone to help me building up the power here (both London  and Houston). People, especially not traders, do not want to leave a  profitable book or origination activities. Quite many got the feedback in  last PRC that they need a number to their name, both P&L and number of  originated deals, so they did not dare to leave. How will that be handled  here?  I think my main strength is trading, and I prefer to do trading, but I have  quite good origination skills. Iknow that in a start up process you need to  do both and I am more than willing to do that.   This was a lot of questions but to get some feedback on them are necessary  for me to take a decision. I will probably go to London on Wednesday and  Thursday next week to speak with Sherriff etc. I will try to call you later  today  Regards   Morten Erik      ",jeffrey.shankman@enron.com,mike.mcconnell@enron.com,Tokyo opportunities,2001-05-03 03:55:00-07:00,sent

You should have received an EGM overview  yesterday and it will be an excellent brief on what we are doing and our  general direction.  I am very interested in having both you and Joe look at  that and provide feedback on the opportunities in Japan.     We can talk about all of your issues later, when we are more prepared, but on  the PRC issue, the key is not simply P&L but on transactions and growing the  business.

I will be in CA next week meeting with Socal and PGE.  With  Socal, we plan to discuss their storage capabilities - to take vaporized LNG  and provide a balancing service.  With PG&E we'll be looking for points where  they could take gas into their system.  We wanted to be fairly specific, but  not tip our hand regarding project timing or exact location.  Socal is  scheduled to release their system study (to receive LNG) tomorrow.  I've requested a meeting next Friday in San Francisco with Jeff Dasovich  (regulatory) and Sandi McCubbin (legislative) to explain our concept and get  their input.  On Thursday, we meet with Samuel Wehn, works for Dave Parquet,  who will tell us how he's permitted power plants in CA.  We'll ask for  suggestions on local law & engineering firms, plus see what Sam can do to  help us.  Any instructions?  If not, I'll proceed as planned.

As we discussed, I am interested in opportunities within your group,  specifically the LNG arena.  I interviewed and discussed this issue with Greg  Curran and Doug J Arnell on Tuesday the 8th.  I strongly believe in the  mutual benefits derived both from my learning and ability to contribute to  your efforts.    I am currently in my second rotation working for Dan Leff and Dick Leibert  in EES.  I have been at Enron since 1996.  In my former role, I served as the  controller for GPG Operations Support (CO 423).  There I managed 25 cost  centers which perform O&M, Procurement, Document Mgmt, and Regulatory  Services for GPG and other assets across the globe.  My role was the sole  source for general administration, budgeting, planning, and financial  reporting.  This included management of $19.5M on a gross basis and  overseeing the day-to-day operation of the Mustang timesheet system.  I also  represented my organization as a Subject Matter Expert (SME) for the July  2000 implementation of SAP within GPG.    In my first rotation in Enron Energy Services I performed analysis,  forecasting, and pricing of power and gas risk management instruments.   Currently I am working on projects ranging from Customer Satisfaction, system  development and implementation, budgeting/space management, California Crisis  Taskforce to new business ventures and cost savings initiatives.  Although an  American citizen by birth, I have also spent 14 years living in the  Caribbean.  I am a team player and a very motivated, high energy individual.   My experience, the responsibilities bestowed, along my willingness to give  110% will provide a valuable asset to a group.  I would like to generate a  dialogue with you regarding the issue.  If there are any questions or  requests of me, please feel free to let me know.

"FYI---one of the many,many articles that have come out over the past few  days.  This one captures the essence of most of them.  See in particular the  part I have highlighted.  General reaction in the business community is that Enron must be crazy to  have worked this hard to beat the competition, only to withdraw just as the  project becomes real.  The phones continue to ring constantly.  At the same time, we have just received the official notification from the  Saudis that we have been awarded, after what is being described as ""fierce  competition"", a piece of Core Venture 2.  We have already wired this with Oxy  and will exit this week in a manner that hopefully protects the relationships  that we have built with the Saudis----but the timing (exactly the same time  that we are withdrawing from Dolphin and filing a termination notice for  Dabhol) does not help.  As you might expect, the mood in the office is terrible----the team is proud  of the fact that they started with nothing two years ago have accomplished  the impossible against great odds (beating the competition in Dolphin, Saudi,  SADAF and Oman, as well as putting together a world-class LNG supply system  for Dabhol) only to have it all fall apart with what is perceived as limited  redeployment potential and little PRC support because of the ""ex EI"" stigma.  Over the next several days we must work through the UOG Dolphin press  announcements, Saudi (we must notify Saudi of our intentions by Wednesday),  explanations regarding Dolphin to all of those that have helped us (e.g.,  U.S. embassy and our local sponsors) and, as luck would have it, the Dubai  government wants to proceed with the Jebel Ali Aluminum/electricity deal (I  suspect that they will change their mind over the next several days as events  unfold).    In addition, we have employee meetings on Tuesday to reduce the size of the  Dubai/Houston team from 35 to 11.  The next several days are not going to be fun....

Firms Line Up to Swim With Dolphin in Abu Dhabi.  05/17/2001 The Oil Daily (c) 2001 Energy Intelligence Group. All rights reserved.  It's all go in Abu Dhabi, where Enron's decision to sell its 24.5% stake in the Dolphin group has opened the door for other oil companies to join the $8 billion project to pipe natural gas from Qatar to the United Arab Emirates (UAE).  At the same time, the oil-rich emirate has launched a tender to sell 28% of Zakum Development Co. (Zadco), which is producing 500,000 barrels per day from the offshore Upper Zakum field. Total Fina Elf, Exxon Mobil, Royal Dutch/Shell, and BP have been invited to bid, and a decision is expected at the beginning of next year. Having been in the cards for a long time, Enron's little-noticed withdrawal from Dolphin was made official about three weeks ago, when it gave the mandatory 30-day notice to its two partners in the consortium, Total and UAE Offsets Group (UOG). Total and UOG will formally announce the news at a press conference in Abu Dhabi on May 21, EIG understands.  Enron's share of Dolphin will be sold back to UOG, which is headed by Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed al Nayhan, who is a UAE Armed Forces chief and a key figure in the Abu Dhabi ruling family. UOG already holds 51% of the project and will then sell whatever portion of its aggregated 75.5% stake it likes. Total, which will operate the upstream side of the project in Qatar, retains its 24.5% interest.  Who else will join is a matter of wild speculation, but there is certainly no shortage of interested parties.  ""The whole industry wants to get involved,"" a source close to the project said.  Among the chasing pack, Conoco is making a strong pitch to join Dolphin, which would compliment its assets in Dubai, where it is operator of 180,000 b/d Dubai Petroleum Co., consolidating its position in the Gulf. Occidental, which like Conoco has no presence in Abu Dhabi, is also sniffing around. And then there are the heavyweights - Exxon, Shell, and BP - all of which are interested and have the advantage of having been in Abu Dhabi's oil sector for more than 20 years.  ""I think we'll see a veritable feeding frenzy,"" said one analyst in the region. ""There are all kind of oily types coming to Abu Dhabi.""  After the Enron experience, UOG's priority will be to find a partner that is reliable and seems unlikely to be taken over by a larger company during the course of the 20-year project, people familiar with the company say. This line of thinking would appear to favor the super majors, although smaller players may have more to gain and thus more to offer.  The Dolphin departure ends an unhappy chapter for Enron in the Gulf and is part of the group's strategy to divest some of its overseas assets. Enron seemed unable to decide what it wanted to do in Qatar: At first it planned to sell liquefied natural gas (LNG) to Israel, then it switched its attention to selling LNG to India. By the time it joined Dolphin two years ago, Enron had made several enemies in Qatar who would not forgive it for commitments that were never fulfilled.  Ironically, Enron has pulled out of Dolphin just when the project looks certain to go ahead. In March, the partners signed the crucial ""term sheet"" for the $1.5 billion upstream part of the project, which calls for the production of 2 billion cubic feet of gas per day from Qatar's giant North field. The deal is due to be finalized by autumn. Dolphin is on course to deliver the first volumes of Qatari gas to Abu Dhabi in 2005.  Abu Dhabi is also pushing ahead with its plan to sell 28% of Zadco, which is 88% owned by state oil company Adnoc and 12% by Japan Oil Development Co. Zadco is a long-running saga: In October 2000, 14.67% was due to be sold to BP and 13.33% to Total, but for reasons known only to itself, the Supreme Petroleum Council decided against the idea.

I've taken the liberty to attach below the name of an individual who has a distinguished business career and since leaving Pittston as an executive VP in 1998, has started his on fund as well as developing other business ventures.  He is very well connected and highly regarded in the Wall Street financial community.  I don't know where it may lead but I am of the opinion it would be of benefit for you both to at least have a discussion and explore opportunities.

What percentage of our coal transactions or business is online? Speed changes on a typical transaction post and pre online? Other changes you see or products to develop International effects Total coal moved (physical and financial) especially online Other competing exchanges and why ours is better Other proEnron facts that illustrate our growing business especially as it  relates to paradigm changes or online changes  Please feed me this info and if there is something specific that you don't  want me to say let me know that too but go ahead and give me the answer.

I think when you read Randy's CV, you will be very  impressed. I would go so far as to say that he was the smartest person I knew  at Koch, and when you see the list of accomplishments that he had there, as  well as what he was doing with Dreyfuss and Electricite de France, you will  agree with me that he would be a terrific addition to Enron Global Markets.  The even better news regarding Randy is that he recently left Dreyfuss due to  issues with the EDF JV, so he is available immediately and he is very  interested. He currently lives in London and I think that he knows Joe Gold.  Please let me know if you would like me to do anything to help facilitate  this further.  I think George is interested if there was a specific  opportunity for him here that he felt was an even better fit than what he is  doing with Koch. The fact that he is moving to Houston makes it pretty easy  for us to keep having discussions with him. I would say, however, if I had to  choose which among the two of them would have the most immediate impact if  hired by Enron, it would have to be Randy, given his experience.

We expect it to include:    1) a 4-year date certain to eliminate MTBE, with EPA determining the phaseout  schedule 2)  a lifting of the 2% oxygenate standard upon perfunctory petition by State  governors within 90 days from date of enactment 3)  and environmental ""anti-backsliding"" provision focused only on air-toxics  and using a 2000 baseline with a 27.5% percent standard (the way I understand  it right now, RFG must perform 27.5% better than 2000 baseline for  conventional gasoline) 4) provisions for MTBE producer ""transition assistance""  Brief analysis:    We'll have more details shortly, but the bill looks a little better than  previous efforts.  A number of bills have been introduced this Congress, but  this will probably be the leading effort.    As you know, Enron has led efforts to include the ""transition assistance""  piece -- which is still largely undefined in the legislation -- but we are  pleased with the inclusion of a ""placeholder"" while the Senate decides on the  best approach.  We will continue to lead the development of such incentives  (which will likely take the form of EPA/DOE funding for MTBE producers who  convert plants to produce iso-octane or alkylate).  An MTBE ban is of course not good, but a ""date certain"" gives producers more  flexibility to determine their options rather than reduce production under  several steps of a phase out.   Allowing states to get a waiver of the oxy  standard is probably a given in any legislation, but will face some  opposition from the ethanol community -- who just want a simple MTBE ban.  The anti-backsliding provision is still being refined, but looks fairly  lame.  We need more details to make an accurate assessment, but its likely  that environmental groups will want a bit more.  One political factor -- with Sen. Jim Jeffords leaving the Republican party,  Democrats will be given control of the Senate Environment Committee, which  will consider this bill.  They will likely allow Jeffords to chair the  committee.  The significance is that Sen. Bob Smith (R-NH) is the current  chair, and has been able to use that position to drive his past bills on MTBE  -- in losing the chairmanship, his legislation may face a longer road through  Committee.

For a P&L that is  this small (and negative) we are all spending too much time on this.  There  is more to this story but I think we should just drop it and move on to  bigger and better things.  I am certainly not wedded to any of this but would rather focus on all the  other issues and problems on my plate.  Let's discuss upon your return on our  weekly call.

This is the inside cover message and  should be 300+ words. I hope that you will be able to squeeze this into your  busy schedule.  Here is a suggested outline.  If you want to fill in the outline with  information, I will be happy to turn it into a letter for you.   I.  An overview of EWS/EGM as we move forward.   II. A short-term retrospective about EGM activities and successes             III. Future plans/initiatives for EGM      (strategic vision of the group, opportunities, expectations, etc.)   Please feel free to modify as you see fit.  I have attached Greg Whalley's  letter from our last issue to give you an idea of the format. Let me know if  there is anything I can do to help you.  I need your letter by June 15, if  possible.   << File: Ensisde Whalley Letter. April 01.doc >>   Hope to hear from you soon.

We expect it to include:    1) a 4-year date certain to eliminate MTBE, with EPA determining the phaseout  schedule 2)  a lifting of the 2% oxygenate standard upon perfunctory petition by State  governors within 90 days from date of enactment 3)  and environmental ""anti-backsliding"" provision focused only on air-toxics  and using a 2000 baseline with a 27.5% percent standard (the way I understand  it right now, RFG must perform 27.5% better than 2000 baseline for  conventional gasoline) 4) provisions for MTBE producer ""transition assistance""  Brief analysis:    We'll have more details shortly, but the bill looks a little better than  previous efforts.  A number of bills have been introduced this Congress, but  this will probably be the leading effort.    As you know, Enron has led efforts to include the ""transition assistance""  piece -- which is still largely undefined in the legislation -- but we are  pleased with the inclusion of a ""placeholder"" while the Senate decides on the  best approach.  We will continue to lead the development of such incentives  (which will likely take the form of EPA/DOE funding for MTBE producers who  convert plants to produce iso-octane or alkylate).  An MTBE ban is of course not good, but a ""date certain"" gives producers more  flexibility to determine their options rather than reduce production under  several steps of a phase out.   Allowing states to get a waiver of the oxy  standard is probably a given in any legislation, but will face some  opposition from the ethanol community -- who just want a simple MTBE ban.  The anti-backsliding provision is still being refined, but looks fairly  lame.  We need more details to make an accurate assessment, but its likely  that environmental groups will want a bit more.  One political factor -- with Sen. Jim Jeffords leaving the Republican party,  Democrats will be given control of the Senate Environment Committee, which  will consider this bill.  They will likely allow Jeffords to chair the  committee.  The significance is that Sen. Bob Smith (R-NH) is the current  chair, and has been able to use that position to drive his past bills on MTBE  -- in losing the chairmanship, his legislation may face a longer road through  Committee.

Subject: RE: Lewandowski ""Industry""  Jeff-  Can you believe it! What's there not to love. It is the  finest mural/painting of its kind I have seen available since the great TH Benton mural cycle purchased by Equitable. Historically and qualitatively, Lewandowski is at the top of the second tier of industrial/precisionist/ social realist painters after artists like Benton and Charles Sheeler. This is a ""machine age"" masterpiece that epitomizes the glorification of the worker and industry- a message Enron should appreciate.  The Lewandowski is a 103"" x 67 oil on canvas executed in 1942. It came off the wall of a building in Milwaukee where Lewandowski lived and worked during the 1930s-40s. The condition is quite good with almost no inpainting and a few horizontal crinkles in the canvas.  The Greenville County Museum of Art had the Lewandowski on final approval,but they hesitated today and I just committed to buy it as it sat at the museum.  The price is $275,000.00 which is higher than any of Lewandowski's other works, but this is monumental and unlike any other work. I hope youw ill agree taht the price is reasonable for a painting of such scale, quality, and historical significance.  Lewandowski's good early industrial watercolors of this era, 18"" x 24"" +/-, have sold for $50,000.00+++. The ""Circuit Breakers"" painting I own that you have seen at the gallery is priced at $150,000.00 and it is close to being sold. I think Southwestern Bell has a Lewandowski watercolor and I know I recently saw an 1939 industrial  Lewandowski painting hanging at the Dallas Museum of Art.  The Lewandowski will be shipped to me from the Greenville County Museum in the coming weeks and I hope you and others at Enron can arrange to see it.  -Michael > -----Original Message----- > From: Jeffrey.A.Shankman@enron.com [mailto:Jeffrey.A.Shankman@enron.com] > Sent: Thursday, May 31, 2001 3:35 PM > To: mr@michaelrosenfeldglry.com > Subject: RE: Lewandowski ""Industry"" > > > Love, Love, Love.

"Darrell,  I attempted to call you a few minutes ago (late night your time - but there  was no voicemail).  I didn't want to wait several more days before I contact  you.  I'm out all weekend.  Eric shared with me some of your concerns about resources for a Korea LNG  opportunity.  I certainly understand your view but wanted to share some of my  thoughts.  Rick and/or Clay know the Asian LNG industry better than anyone  else in the company.  They are very good and I have a lot of faith in them  and their ability to assess opportunities and develop projects.  They are  lacking wholesale type of transaction experience that a few of the guys that  have recently come into the group have.  That is why we have brought them  in.   We have a very strong team and i like the mix a lot.    Eric is the person we chose to run the group for many reasons but it wasn't'  done as a lack of faith in Rick or his original team.  The biggest  opportunities and the viewpoint we must take in this business is running it  like a wholesale unit and running it as a portfolio of transactions and  books.  That certainly doesn't  mean that 20 years of experience doesn't have  enormous value especially in the non-Atlantic markets.  Rick is in the  process of coming back to Houston after the shut down of our middle east  projects and strategy.  Rick is also in the process of assessing what exactly  he would like to do in the time of transition.  My very sincere hope is that  he will stay in the LNG group and perform a very important role especially in  this type of development or deal making role.  Especially  in a big deal in  Japan, Korea or something in the Asian area.  We will discuss this next week  when he comes to town.    I need Eric to be in Houston right now due to our Elba Island, Venezuela and  Bahamas immediate activity.  He will certainly be engaged in everything but  he can not be focuses as much as you need in Korea or Joe needs in Japan.  Please give me a call next week and we can discuss this in more detail.

"Mike, ? You will probably receive a call from the  top JDRF Legislative Volunteer,  Leah Mullin. Her husband, Leo Mullin, is CEO of  Delta Airlines and they have  a diabetic son. They are also very friendly with  the Brennemans. ? Leah would like to enlist the help of  yourself and any Enron  powers-that-be for support from Dick Cheney for stem cell  funding. ? As you know, from our many mailouts, this is  a hot topic! We are very  afraid that Pres Bush and VP Cheney might ban stem cell  research, thus  negating all chances of our cure for diabetes. ? I hope that you can help Leah when she  calls. I have sung your praises to  her (and just about everyone from Washington  to Timbucktu). Thanks, Mike.

Looks like Chitwood will no longer be involved, and Rothwell has a new team.  ----- Forwarded by Khush Nariman/HOU/NorthAmerica/MCKINSEY on 06/06/2001 08:08 AM ----- (Embedded image moved to file: pic12193.gif) Wednesday, June 6, 2001 Source: Associated Press Leased Line   Two senior executives to retire in company split   KINGSPORT, Tenn. (AP) _ Two senior executives will retire as part of a management restructuring at Eastman Chemical Co. coinciding with the division of the chemical and plastics giant into two separate companies by year's end.   Eastman Chairman and CEO Earnest Deavenport Jr. said Tuesday that Dr. James L. Chitwood and Garland S. Williamson will follow him into retirement on Dec. 31.   That is the date Eastman Chemical has set for its tax-free spinoff into two companies _ a specialty chemicals, coatings and adhesives company called Eastman Co., and a plastics and acetate fibers commodities company yet to be named.   Chitwood, 58, is senior vice president for corporate strategy and chief technology officer. Williamson, 57, is senior vice president for worldwide operations and chief health, safety and environmental officer.   Chitwood has worked for Eastman for 33 years; Williamson for 34 years. Deavenport cited Chitwood's contributions to research and development and Williamson's efforts to reduce costs.   ""We very much appreciate the contributions these two executives have made to Eastman,"" Deavenport said.   Brian Ferguson, who will head the new Eastman Co., said his management team will include: Betty DeVinney, 56, senior vice president for human resources and communications; Theresa Lee, 48, senior vice president and general counsel; Roger Mowen, 55, senior vice president for e-commerce and marketing, and James Rogers, 50, chief operating and financial officer.   Allan Rothwell, who be CEO of the new plastics spinoff, said David Cotey, 44, will be vice president and general counsel; Richard Johnson, 52, group vice president for fibers; Fielding Rolston, 60, senior vice president of human resources; Thomas Smith, 57, group vice president for plastics, and Albert Wargo, 47, vice president, chief financial officer and treasurer.   Based in Kingsport, Eastman has about 15,000 employees in 30 countries and 2000 sales of $5.3 billion.   Its stock price closed on the New York Stock Exchange at $51.17 Tuesday, up 38 cents.        +-------------------------------------------------------------+ | This message may contain confidential and/or privileged     | | information.

I  would appreciate your cooperation with the key move issues that are outlined  below:  IMPORTANT - A special building tour has been scheduled for the EGM business  unit heads receiving this message.  Jeff and I, along with Bill Donovan,  would like to invite you to join us for a tour on this Friday morning, June  8th, from 8:30 to 9:30 a.m.  Even if you have already had an opportunity to  visit the new building, we think this would be a great opportunity for all of  us to see the space together and discuss any issues at that time.  Please  contact Cathy Phillips at X-36898 if you plan to attend the tour. New building floor plan modification requests will no longer be accepted.   Any change requests that have already been received are currently being  considered and will be conveyed to the appropriate business unit head. If vacant positions exist and they will be filled before the move on August  3rd, they need to be identified on all reports and floor plans with their  name, NH (for new hire) and an approximate hire date.  Example:  Bob Smith NH  7/25 Any space/move related questions or issues that may arise should be addressed  by Cathy Phillips.  Please do not contact Susan Lopez for any space related  issues.  Jeff and I have asked Cathy and Jennifer Burns to be responsible for  the allocation of space in the new building and they are keeping us well  informed as to the progress and any issues as they arise. Jeff and I are very aware that space is very tight in the new building and we  will be addressing growth and additional space needs and issues in the near  future. A limited number of Turret phones will be available in the new building.  The  Turret phones will be assigned to traders and their assistants only.   Everyone else on the floor will receive a new upgraded version of the Lucent  phone (with the existing phone numbers).  Please contact Jennifer Burns if  you have any questions or issues related to phones. All private team rooms, offices and conference rooms have been assigned and  there are no more available for assignment to the individual groups or  people.  On the 3rd floor we will have the following public conference space  available by making reservations (specific scheduling details to follow  later): 1 Mega conference room 1 Large conference room with videoconference capabilities 1 Large conference room - no videoconference  3 Team rooms File space on the floor is being upgraded and allocations of file space will  be made for each group.  Every attempt is being made to have the assigned  file space as close to each individual group as possible. At this time, details related to food deliveries and distribution have not  been resolved.  Your patience and flexibility with all food related issues  will be appreciated.  It is highly probable that food service in the new  building will be very difficult at first and as we get closer to the move  date, more information will be provided related to food service, deliveries  and distribution. Since Jeff and I both already keep Cathy and Jennifer very busy, we would  appreciate it if you would send all your comments, questions, or issues to  them via e-mail.  They have agreed to make themselves available every Monday  at 4:30 p.m. to meet with anyone to discuss their questions.  Please make  arrangements with them directly to meet regarding your issues. There will be a 60 day freeze on any building changes once we move into the  new building.  I understand that this is a difficult process and that there are a lot of  questions and issues, but Jeff and I are convinced that this will be great  and everything will work out in time.

"Clay and I have completed our review visits in Korea and Japan.  I will be  available in Houston starting the afternoom of 14 June and continuing through  about end-June for PRC's and to discuss and finalize the Pacific Basin LNG  strategy and organization issues that we highlighted when you were in Korea.   As we discussed in Korea, I believe that if we intend to develop a Pacific  Basin LNG business, (including the US west coast), we need to define and  articulate a vision and strategy to the LNG group by the end of June or we  risk having our Pacific team members drift away to our competitors.  There is a lot happening in the Pacific and our key people are well known and  well thought of.  There is a genuine feeling within the team at this time  that Enron's LNG focus is on North America/Atlantic basin and that there is  little top management support for the commitment of time and resources to  build a more global business.    I'd like to set up a meeting with you to discuss this, preferably on 21 or 22  June (i.e., right after the PRC reviews).

"Mark and Greg, =20  FYI, below is an update from John Nowlan on Q3 issues surrounding the crude=  and products P&L.  I thought you would find this informative as to what is=  going on.  Mike  3rd Quarter update Recent steps taken to manage crude and products As you are aware the big changes this year have come from breaking the vari= ous businesses into their respective area and giving the lead to managing t= he business to a specific individual e.g. J. Goughary - Gasoline, C. Mahone= y - Distillates, N. Clarke - Resid, S. Bland - Petchems, B. White and D. Sc= hroeder - Crude.  This was done to give more business focus and ensure as w= e build the mid marketing and origination groups we have the right trading = structure.  As for origination and mid marketing we have been very successf= ul building out the USA org and now will be looking to add some talent in E= urope.  Origination likewise we have been successful in the crude and produ= cts area with Randy's team.  On the petchem side, I have been interviewing = extensively over the past week and hope to have one very strong addition fo= r Doug, Tim O'Neal, and two very highly rated associates coming from EBS. A= s for the trading itself, I imposed trading limits on all traders 3 weeks a= go and, as will be addressed next, we are not losing much if any money on o= ur daily trading rather the losses are coming from primarily one huge struc= tured position.  Lastly, we have been quite aggressive in divesting of any = individuals, which were not helping us to achieve the goals, which we have = set forth.  Bill Briggs, Phil Clifford and Andrea Hauser will all be leavin= g the group.  3rd Quarter loss explanation Losses to date:  $40.23 million $30.79 is in the ERAC book (i.e. Don's big P+ and Nymex swap position) ?=09$23.34 is due to Vega, Theta and Gammas Vega:  $4.30 Theta:  $16.72 Gamma:  $2.30 ?=09$5.2 due to curve shift $5.2 million in distillates ?=09$1.3 million we discovered in a mis -marked curve when Bill Briggs was = terminated. ?=09$5.52 million is curve shift (inventories we are holding globally in a = falling market)  P+ issues and management Two key problems: 1.=09Correlation marked on the Cal 02 is still too low, we need to raise th= is correlation. 2.=09Nymex option position, which was put in the book to hedge the P+ posit= ion, is too large and mis -marked, i.e. the market is 3.20 and we are marke= d at 2.85. Solutions and steps forward: We have $15 million to correct some of this problem and that was getting do= ne late last week.  Don has been talking to Koch and BP in restructuring th= e P+ book and moving a portion of the CAL 01 and early 02 position out as f= ar as 03 so we have smaller, more manageable positions.  Ideally over the n= ext week we hope to get the book to a position where the theta bleed goes f= rom $270k/day down to around $100k/day.  This is worth $5.1 million a month=  to us.  Lastly, once we get through the next few months a significant piec= e of our exposure rolls off.  In summary, the ""day trading"" the group has done has been steady in a very = choppy market; it is the ERAC structure, which is tainting us.  It would be=  useful to you if Rob, Don and I got together with you to go over all the s= pecifics some time this week, as it is difficult to handle by Email.

The greatest impact has been to the property insurers with loss estimates in the billions. Liability insurers have seen a lesser impact in projected losses but rates are also expected to rise.  Our initial budget assumptions could not foresee this event. After consultation with our insurance market resources, we have deemed it necessary to increase our premium projections by an additional $9million for Property and $3million for Excess Liability. Enron's Worker's Compensation, Auto Liability, and General Liability are insulated from market fluctuations due to the use of our captive to fund these exposures.  Our budget only contemplates actual premiums. In the event the property deductible increases beyond the capabilities of the business units, we may be required to arrange a funding or other mechanism to manage the deductible. We are prepared to discuss this with you on an individual basis.  You will be receiving a revised budget from Corporate Financial Planning incorporating these increases.

There is also fear for instability in Saudi Arabia, where little information is available about the capabilities and intentions of Islamic extremist elements.  Consensus opinion has been built in Washington that Iraq was involved in the 11 September terrorist attacks on the US, exacerbating fears that the situation in the region could spiral out of control.    According to a senior US intelligence official, US policymakers have become increasingly concerned about the prospects for instability in the Middle East and South Asia.  Washington is focused particularly on the potential for a major conflict between Pakistan and India, and intelligence officials are attempting to track the location and control of nuclear weapons in the region.  Secretary of State Powell's trip to the two countries, although portrayed publicly as part of the effort to ensure support for US military action in Afghanistan, is in fact intended to address tensions between Islamabad and New Delhi, which have grown in recent days.  (India shelled several Pakistani military outposts in the disputed Kashmir territory today; an Indian army general described it as a ""punitive action."")  Washington is also significantly more concerned than media coverage would suggest over the potential for major unrest in Saudi Arabia.  This fear is heightened by a lack of detailed information available on the royal family's grip on power and the capabilities of Islamic extremist elements in Saudi Arabia, which share similar goals: removal of the Saudi dynasty, establishment of a true Islamic state, and the removal of the US military presence.  Saudi and US officials regard bin Ladin as one of the prime perpetrators of Islamic extremist violence in Saudi Arabia and elsewhere in the region.  Bin Ladin has been outspoken in his criticism of what he calls 'military occupation' of Saudi Arabia.  Unrest in Saudi Arabia could have a relatively dramatic impact on regional stability and the global economy because of its leading role both in the Arab world and in OPEC.  US government officials are now generally convinced that the Iraqi government played a role in supporting the 11 September terrorist strikes in the US.  The well-publicized difference of opinion between senior State and Defense Department officials over the handling of the Iraq question has been reported accurately in the media. Concern is growing within Washington that the situation in the Middle East could spiral out of control if Iraq were drawn into the military conflict precipitously, if major hostilities between Pakistan and India were to break out, or if the Saudi royal family's grip on power were to loosen.",mike.mcconnell@enron.com,a..shankman@enron.com,"FW: Increasing Washington Concerns over Potential Instability in  Pakistan, India, and Saudi Arabia",2001-10-15 14:36:07-07:00,received

As per our 2002 plan we have already begun the review of Europe to determine the economic feasibility of a terminal with the objective of making a determination in Q1 2002.  I agree with Michael in that it would be my preference for you and John to iron this out as opposed to having conflicts at the working levels among our groups.  Obviously, we need the EEL gas desk to make a sharp market for current and future LNG deliveries.  My pitch to John would be that we would like to have a similar relationship with EEL as we do with ENA.  (i.e. they make a market for pipeline gas and we develop terminals, we take terminal positions, we build and manage the global Enron merchant portfolio, etc.)  Two obvious benefits to our current structure are a coherent global LNG strategy and one risk book to manage the associated business risks.

"Jim,  I will make my self available for a meeting if it can really happen.  This is very difficult for me do pull off but I'll be there if he can meet.  I am very skeptical that he would have a meeting to tell us that our project is dead or let us vent our frustration of wasting several years and $15 million putting together this project.

The ambassador responded initially that Chavez's schedule had been ""set for months"" and that changing the schedule would be difficult.  After further discussion, he said Chavez would certainly be interested in discussing the project, and that they might be able to make time on the schedule at about 1100 hours on Tuesday 23 Oct.  We provided a brief overview of the status of the project, and he asked that we provide as soon as possible names and bio information for whoever would meet with Chavez if this comes off.  He promised to get back to us as quick as he can.  Please let us know who will be available from Houston for a possible Tuesday morning meeting here.  Thanks.

Moody's is working with us to re-affirm.  There is no issue on liquidity or credit issues.  I am listening to the analyst call right now which these issues are being discussed.

"what do you think?   -----Original Message----- From:  Gonzales, Eric   Sent: Friday, October 26, 2001 9:02 AM To: Shankman, Jeffrey A. Subject:   Jeff,  As discussed yesterday, provided below is the note I mentioned.  Please call to discuss.  I would like to get this inter-company relationship agreed today.  Eric      x52711      In an effort to promote an internal operating business structure that maximizes the value opportunities for Enron in respect to European LNG activities, provided below is an agreed group interaction protocol.  Defined points of contact LNG's European commercial lead: Clay Harris Continental Commercial Nat Gas lead: Steve Sapling  Clay Harris and Steve Asplin shall meet at a minimum weekly to discuss current ongoing business and relevant future transaction prospects.    Prospective transactions with existing European LNG Market Participants The LNG group shall continue to advance the execution of Master LNG Purchase and Sales Agreements with these relevant European LNG players: Distrigas, Tractabel, GdF, Gas Natural, Repsol, Enagas, Botas, Enel, SNAM/ENI, Edison, Iberdrola, Union Fenosa, Endesa, etc.  Clay Harris and Steve Asplin will coordinate these activities, which will be further coordinated with the relevant EEL country representatives.  The LNG group shall always use Steve Asplin and these relationship managers to coordinate meetings to discuss LNG opportunities on a regional and global basis.  An invitation to join these meetings should and shall always be extended to both groups when LNG opportunities are to be discussed.  European ex-ship LNG transactions shall not require intermediation by the EEL nat gas trading desk. However, the LNG group shall always keep the relevant EEL trading desks aware of the proposed transactions in advance.   LNG Sales into France and Belgium The groups will maintain daily contact regarding prospective LNG terminal capacity positions and LNG sales.  The two group's main short term interaction objective shall be for the facilitation of market making for the prospective LNG deliveries by the LNG group.  An important factor that all parties must appreciate is that Enron's activities in Belgium are extremely sensitive to relationship issues with Distrigas.  LNG Sales into Spain At this point in its development, the natural gas market in Spain is unique to other continental markets given the limited access to source pipelines and the significant market share of LNG.  As such, a coordinated effort to source, create and execute transactions is imperative for Enron's success.  To create an atmosphere of thorough communication, the EEL nat gas group will ensure that an invitation is extended to the LNG group for its gas marekting meetings and discussions, and that the LNG group is completely informed regarding potential transactions.  The LNG group will ensure that the EEL nat gas group is kept fully informed and included in potential sourcing activities.  The overriding goal shall be to ensure that transactions are completed that create the maximum possible value for Enron Corp.  Current Proposed Spanish Transaction As discussed above, in order to capture the current prospective transaction opportunities in Spain, EEL and Global LNG have agreed to jointly take the proposed length position (0.7BCM/yr for 2 to 5 years) in Spain.  The P&L shall be managed on a complete open book basis (i.e. groups will exchange all relevant term sheets associated with LNG purchases, nat gas sales, re-gas and transit costs, and shipping).  Any margins generated shall be split between the groups.  Determination of the relevant margins shall take into account the market value of LNG groups prior existing LNG charter positions, as well as prior existing EEL  trading desk positions nat gas group.    The final determination of the value split shall be made on a fully open book basis by Eric Gonzales and Eric Shaw.",mike.mcconnell@enron.com,a..shankman@enron.com,FW: eel/egm lng,2001-10-26 10:44:58-07:00,received
