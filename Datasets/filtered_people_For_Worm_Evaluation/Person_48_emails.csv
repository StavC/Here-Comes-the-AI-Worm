"Mr. Rogers, Just to quickly address your questions in advance of our call in the morning, I offer the following:  1.  The debt amount contemplated was based on assumptions given by Enron. The rate given was $375 /kW or $120MM in debt.  This would be obtained via a 144A Bond offering without any subdebt.  2.  There are three operating fees listed in the proforma currently: Management fee ($600k/yr) to the Owners as contracted, O&M Fee ($300k/yr) to the Operator contemplated to be TECO Power Services (""TPS"") and the TPS Parts Company for a spare engine.  The TPS Spare engine may be eliminated provided we can get comfort via other methods.  The financing fees were estimates based on discussions with Enron and our engaging CSFB.  3.  The Maintenance Reserve account is accrued based on operating hours of the plant and planned major maintenance, as estimated by TPS (the O&M Operator).  This reserve may be eliminated as we currently are estimating that this plant will never reach a major outage.  I look forward to discussing these issues with you in the morning.

"---------------------- Forwarded by Benjamin Rogers/HOU/ECT on 12/16/99 10:= 16=20 AM ---------------------------   =20 =09Enron North America Corp. =09 =09From:  Enron NA Office of the Chairman                           12/16/9= 9=20 01:15 AM =09  To: All Enron North America cc: =20 Subject: Organizational Changes   To:  Enron North America Corp.  From:  Cliff Baxter and Kevin Hannon   In July, as part of the Enron North America (ENA) reorganization, the=20 implementation of several objectives were highlighted as critical to the=20 continued growth of ENA including: 1) accelerate the development of our=20 people, 2) significantly expand our customer network and associated markets= ,=20 and 3) accelerate and enhance the information flow between groups, both=20 within ENA and across Enron. Consistent with these objectives and with the= =20 corporate goal of fostering =01&One Enron=018, we would like to announce th= e=20 following organizational changes in the Coverage/Origination Groups and the= =20 Commercial Transactions Group within ENA.  1) Coverage/Origination:  To ensure a consistent strategy, the free flowing of resources and product= =20 technology and the appropriate focus in the midstream and downstream=20 businesses, the following coverage/origination groups will be consolidated= =20 under the leadership of Dave Delainey : a) power development solutions for electric and gas utilities, municipals,= =20 co-ops, energy service companies and IPP=01,s; b) the Downstream Coverage/Origination groups which focus on delivering a= =20 broad range of products and services to the heavy industrial customers=20 including  pulp and paper, chemicals, plastics, refined products, metals an= d=20 mining, heavy manufacturing, industrial gases, fertilizers, transportation,= =20 textiles and glass manufacturing the Eastern and Western U.S. Midstream=20 Coverage/ Origination groups which focus on energy, finance and industries.  Downstream Coverage/Origination  As energy deregulation continues in North America, it is becoming clear tha= t=20 the heavy industrial segment will be an important customer market for both= =20 ENA and Enron Corp.  Further, it is clear that ENA can significantly expand= =20 its industrial customer network and create more innovative industrial=20 solutions by having a group that can deploy all the capabilities of Enron= =20 Corp.  Against this backdrop, the Downstream Coverage/Origination function= =20 will expand its product offering to include not only ENA=01,s existing ener= gy=20 commodities, energy services, finance, assets and pulp and paper capabiliti= es=20 but also EES=01,s energy outsourcing capability and Global Fuel=01,s chemic= als,=20 plastics and refined products risk management capability.  These additional= =20 capabilities will be offered in conjunction with EES and the Global Fuels= =20 groups. Given the size and importance of this Enron initiative, Greg Piper= =20 will be returning from Portland to manage this business. Under Greg=01,s=20 leadership, the Downstream Origination effort will be segmented into three= =20 sub-groups given the nature of these industries and our product offering: a) Pulp and Paper =01) Edward Ondarza will continue to manage the coverage= =20 activities in the Pulp and Paper business. This group will be responsible f= or=20 the provision of innovative=20 products and services in the pulp and paper industry including the provisio= n=20 of paper risk management products; b) Chemicals, Plastics and Refined Products =01) We have asked Jim Ajello t= o=20 lead the coverage activities in this business.  This group will be=20 responsible for the provision of innovative products and services in the=20 chemicals and refined products industries; c) Non-Integrated Industrials =01) Bruce Garner, formerly leader of Bankers= =20 Trust=01,s global metals and mining group in London, has joined ENA to lead=  the=20 coverage activities in this business.  This group will be responsible for t= he=20 provision of innovative products and services for the metals and mining,=20 heavy manufacturing, industrial gases, fertilizers, transportation, textile= s=20 and glass manufacturing industries.     Midstream Coverage/Origination  a) Eastern Coverage/Origination =01) This group=01, activities will focus o= n=20 energy, finance and power development solutions for electric and gas=20 utilities, municipals, co-ops and energy service companies in the Eastern= =20 Interconnect. We have asked  Janet Dietrich to assume the leadership of thi= s=20 group; b) Western Coverage/Origination =01) This group=01,s activities will focus = on=20 energy, finance and power development solutions for electric and gas=20 utilities, municipals, co-ops and energy service companies in the WSCC. The= y=20 will also continue to manage all Qualified Facilities (QF) restructuring=20 opportunities in the Western U.S.  We have asked Chris Calger to assume the= =20 leadership of this coverage group. Chris will relocate to Portland from=20 Calgary where he currently leads the Canadian downstream origination effort= s; c) IPP Merchant Coverage/Origination =01) This group=01,s activities will f= ocus on=20 the provision of structured energy, finance and asset solutions for the=20 emerging merchant power generators who control large portfolio=01,s of merc= hant=20 power generation either through development or acquisition. We have asked = =20 Mike Miller to assume the leadership of this group.  In addition, Mike will= =20 continue to manage the power development activities in the Eastern=20 Interconnect; d) Eastern QF Restructuring =01) This group will focus on the QF restructur= ing=20 opportunities in the Eastern Interconnect including the existing=20 restructuring and re-capitalization of the East Coast Power assets.  We hav= e=20 asked Dave Duran to assume the leadership of this business. Greg Blair,=20 formerly of Enron Asia=01,s development group, Doug Clifford, formerly of= =20 Citizens power, and Dick Lydecker, formerly of Cogen Technology, will join= =20 this newly formed business.  2) Commercial Transactions:=20  The Commercial Transactions Group (CTG), co-headed by Ray Bowen and Jeff=20 Donahue, was formed to provide a centralized resource for the execution of= =20 transactions within ENA =01) and thereby, improve ENA=01,s efficiency in ex= ecuting=20 transactions and free-up the origination groups to increase their intensity= =20 of client coverage.  CTG consists of six primary functions: Transaction=20 Development, Capital Structuring and Portfolio Management, Commodity=20 Structuring and Transportation, Transactional Support/Accounting, Technical= =20 Analysis and Upstream Asset Management.  The Transaction Development Group will be responsible for deal leadership,= =20 execution and optimization of all aspects of a transaction in conjunction= =20 with the originator. The function will be divided into four teams, each of= =20 which will be dedicated to between two and four origination groups.  This= =20 dedication to specific groups should provide a closer link, better service= =20 and greater accountability with the origination groups; however, the CTG=20 resources are designed to be a fungible and flexible resource allocated to= =20 the highest value transactions across the coverage functions:  a) Midstream Transaction Development will be dedicated to the Eastern and= =20 Western Coverage/Origination Groups.  The senior members of this group=20 include Billy Lemmons, George McCormick, Erin Norris and Russ Porter. Billy= =20 Lemmons joined Enron in 1992.  Most recently, he was the Vice-President of= =20 Capital Structuring and Risk Management for EES. Russ Porter joins us today= =20 from Dynegy where he was a manager with responsibilities for power=20 origination. b) Downstream Transaction Development will be dedicated to ENA=01,s industr= ial=20 origination efforts in Pulp and Paper, Petrochemicals and Refining,=20 Environmental Energy, Metals and Mining and other industries as coverage is= =20 established.  The senior members of this team include Rodney Malcolm, Jay= =20 Boudreaux, Finley Biggerstaff and Chris Helfrich.  We anticipate announcing= =20 two to four more additions to this team within the next few weeks. c) Generation Transaction Development will be dedicated to the IPP Merchant= =20 Services and power plant development and QF Restructuring groups.  The seni= or=20 members of this team include Thomas Suffield, Andy Kelemen, Kelly Mahmoud a= nd=20 John House. Thomas Suffield joined Enron in 1996. Most recently, he was the= =20 Vice-President of Origination for the Latin American group in Azurix.  We= =20 anticipate announcing two more additions to this team within the next few= =20 weeks. d) Upstream Transaction Development will be dedicated to the Producer=20 Finance, Coal and Gas Assets groups.  The senior members of this team inclu= de=20 Brad Dunn, John Curtin and Chris Hilgert.  We hope to announce the addition= =20 of at least one VP to this group prior to yearend.  Ray Bowen will have primary oversight responsibilities for the Upstream and= =20 Downstream Transaction Development teams with Jeff Donahue having primary= =20 responsibilities for the Midstream and Generation teams.  Andrea Reed will= =20 continue to head Capital Structuring and Portfolio Management: all junior= =20 commercial resources within the Transaction Development teams will have dua= l=20 responsibilities to both their Transaction Development teams and to the=20 Capital Structuring Group.  The remaining four groups within CTG will remai= n=20 largely unchanged.  In addition, the Origination and the Transaction=20 Development teams and their respective origination groups will be located= =20 together.  We believe that these changes will significantly enhance our market coverag= e=20 and industry knowledge in all ENA=01,s markets particularly in the industri= al=20 markets. It will also provide a closer partnership and accountability betwe= en=20 the Coverage/Origination Groups and the CTG Groups.=20  Please help us in continuing to build on the success we have enjoyed in Nor= th=20 America by working with us to implement these changes.

They want to see if we have anything to offer.  In the meantime, they will go  forward with their RFP.  Do not factor in any cost for the gas pipeline.  The local distribution  company will absorbe the cost and go at risk for new incremental load.  The cost to go through the LDC is 15 cents/mmbtu on a variable or usage  basis.  10 cents for transport and 5 cents for service fee.  Peoples gas  aggregates gas purchases for a number of customers in the region and  purchases gas month to month.  RPU pays a fixed gas price that changes month  to month.  We would need to add 15 cents/mmbtu to gas price from our curves.  Substation work should be approximately $5.8MM and no higher than $6mm.  As a point of reference, RPU's estimate for a fully installed LM-2500 is  $17MM.  They break this out to $11.8MM for turbine and generator, $1.2 MM  engineering cost, $400k winter package and $3.6MM other stuff.  RPU will have a gas pressure guarantee of 300# so we need to have a  calculation done on the cost of compression to step up from 300 to 600.  My  guess is that it will be around $1mm.

"Scott,  Structuring got back to us with some issues we need to clarify to get the  pricing from a trader.  Capacity  - Will Calpine be able to get manufacturer's guarantee for net capacity (or  can we re-sell turbines to third party?)  - Is it ""unit contingent call"" or there will be a kind of ""liquidated damage  protection"" within the tolling agreement?  Nodal pricing  - What is the exact name of substation in eastern PJM? Structuring could not  find ""Parlin"" (even within eastern PJM, there will a substantial pricing  differential among different bus points).  Gas delivery point  Actually, it is really hard to get the number by today since a trader who  will give pricing is not here today and such a short period of notice. If we  don't hear from you or/and if you don't decide yet, we will make assumption  as follows;  - Capacity: 180 MW out of 4 LM-6000 turbine with manufacturer's guarantee and  with term of liquidated damage protection included. - Exact substation: East Hub in PJM - Gas delivery point: Transco Zone 6  We will try to get the pricing hopefully by tomorrow.

"Ben,  Another issue I have in my mind is how we handle revenue after 3 and 5 years.  Since Calpine will have only 3 or 5 year tolling agreement, it is appropriate  to assume Calpine's revenue will come purely from market. Therefore, we may  just need one line of revenue, rather than breaking into capacity payment and  energy payment. Let's talk to Scott when he gets back to Houston.

David Jemison:      Thank you for taking the time to meet with me last Friday afternoon.  I really enjoyed meeting you and talking about the Texas Business School.  My meetings with Professors' Brown, Titman and Ronn were extremely helpful with regards to learning about the energy-finance program and the investment fund.     In reference to our discussion about my low GMAT scores, I do not test well on these types of tests, thus I have always had to work a lot harder than most to get where I want to go, therefore I am accustom to working hard to reach my goals.  Enron is based on a team-oriented approach, where people with diverse skills come together to formulate innovative ideas and financial products and to solve difficult problems for our customers.  The Texas Business School seems to work on this approach, thus I would be able to provide my skills as well as learn from others.  I have excelled in this type of environment at Enron and feel that I would continue to excel at the Texas Business School.  I am fully committed to become successful and do well within the energy-finance program and will work hard to be able to learn from and contribute to the program.     After talking with you and others at the School, I am certain that the Texas Business School would be a perfect fit for me.  With my experiences from State Street Bank and Enron, I would be able to contribute a great deal to the program and continue to add to the program after graduation.  Thanks again for taking the time to meet with me and to show an interest in my career goals.

"Greetings, Mr. Rogers  We are now in possession of your TEXASMBA admission application.  Though it has not yet completed the formal review process, you are correct in your assessment that your GMAT score may prove to be a tremendous negative in your overall competitive profile.  Before I conclude our final review, I would ask that you further clarify to me the nature of the learning disability you mention in your fourth essay. I am especially interested in how this disability directly affects your performance in a timed, test situation, as well as the traditional classroom setting.  Also, you mention in your essay that you have ""... overcome this disability ...""   I would ask that you cite for me the specific steps you have taken to accomplish this feat, and by what measures you may make this claim.  Finally, I would ask that you summarize for me the reasons why you feel your level of academic performance at Catholic University of America will not be replicated in the graduate business classroom here at The TEXAS Graduate School of Business.  As you consider your responses to these questions, I am placing your application on ""hold"".  No final decision will be made until you are satisfied that you have provide whatever additional information you feel appropriate and merited.  I look forward to hearing from you, and thank you for your interest in The TEXAS Graduate School of Business.  ********************************** Dr. Carl H.

Dr. Harris:      After receiving an e-mail from Meg Brooks, she has informed me that she as sent my e-mail on to you.  I wanted to make sure that I have properly provided enough information to the Admissions office regarding my low GMAT score.  Three weeks ago I visited the school to participate in a information session, Admissions Visit and to visit with Professors' Sheridan Titman, Ehud Ronn, Keith Brown and David Jemison.  The discussions I had with Professors Titman and Ronn were to discuss the Energy Finance Program, which I intend to pursue at the school and as a career after graduation.  After talking with them, they seemed to think that I would be a good fit with the School and especially the Energy Finance Program.  Due to my disability towards tests such as the GMAT, I feel that the GMAT is not a good indicator of how I will perform at UT.  Through the experiences I have had with State Street Bank and especially with Enron, two very competitive environments, I know that I will continue to be successful at the Texas Business School.     Please let me know if  you want me to provide this documentation on my disability or if you what to meet in person I will come to Austin to meet with you.  I know that UT would be a perfect fit for the skills I have attained to help me contribute to the program as well as learn the skills I need to build on and further my career in the energy-finance industry..     Thank you in advance for taking the time to review my application.  I hope that I have provided all the information you need to make an informed decision.

"Greetings, Mr. Rogers  Your initial response to my request for a information regarding your disability  is adequate at this time.  As for your comment regarding the prospects for an improved GMAT exam score -- if you do not feel you will be able to improve your score through a retake, I am unclear why you are making the attempt.  We have no interest in you retaking the test just to retake the test.  Only if you strongly feel your score can be improved should you even consider the attempt.  Only you know if your first score is truly reflective of the best score you can receive -- disability or not.  That is the reason the option to retake the test was presented to you as it was.  My advice is do not retake the test if you feel your current score is the best examination result you can achieve.  If, however, and for whatever reason you feel your current score does not reflect your best examination results -- then do proceed with the reexamination.  Regardless of your decision, I remain available for whatever assistance I might provide as you now continue to consider the options before you.  ********************************** Dr. Carl H.

After consulting with OEC, the previous fees were not believed to be at  ""market"". 2. Annual Maintenance was recalculated after having more time to do a bottom  up estimate. 3.

Feel free to= =20 call me (34292) if you still have any question.  Yvan     1_  We will value Teco as a series of hourly Spread options.=20 Legitimate points of concern:=20 a) Are we valuing an index deal or a physical deal?   b) If it is a physical deal can the plant realistically react on an hourl= y=20 basis?  Answer: The deal Enron enters into is based on an spread between PJM index= =20 and the appropriate OIL curve (New York Harbor + basis). However, the trigg= er=20 for the default of the contract (which is really what we are concerned with= )=20 is a function of the plant cash flows compared to the debt level. The plant= =20 cash flows depend on the physical operations of the plant and its capacity = to=20 dispatch during the most expensive hours of the year. Therefore the questio= n=20 of whether the plant can or cannot ramp up quickly enough to dispatch=20 economically is very pertinent to our valuation.=20 I would argue that the plant will always (or almost always) be able to=20 dispatch economically for the following 2 reasons. In the first place, its= =20 operational ramp up time is only 10 minutes. Secondly, the scalar curve we= =20 use is fairly well behaved and doesn=01,t swing around a mean position (see= =20 graph below), hence allowing sufficient preparation for the dispatchers. Th= e=20 chances of dispatchers being caught by surprise when prices spike up or dow= n=20 should therefore be relatively small, and the plant should be able to follo= w=20 the real time prices pretty well.      2_ The power curve we use is PJM west. Even though the plant is located in= =20 the south east end of PJM (i.e. the del Marva peninsula), we prefer not to= =20 use the east curve which is too thinly traded to be meaningful.=20  4_ So far we have only used monthly vol for power. Should we start using=20 daily vol as well, then the blending formula would be: 'fvol =3D Sqr((dblMvol * dblMvol * (jDate - jToday) + dblDvol * dblDvol * 1= 5) /=20 (jDate - jToday + 15))  with  jDate the first of the considered month of dispatch  dblMvol the monthly vol  dblDvol the daily vol  6_ We are assuming 50% flat correlation for 20 years (a much more=20 conservative assumption than 15%). However we run sensitivities where the= =20 correlation goes from 30% to 70%.  7_ Yes, we are deducting all operative expenses from the valuation.=20 Origination is currently trying to reconcile the differences in operations= =20 expenses between their numbers and those used by credits.  8_ The valuation model (coded by Alex Huang, Research) is based on a=20 bidimensional tree, and therefore doesn=01,t use the SPRDOPT function. Howe= ver,=20 we checked that the SPRDOPT function from the structuring model and the tre= e=20 based model yielded the same values for the spread option.  9_ The strike for the spread option is the sum of the OIL price + the VOM.          ***************************************************************************= *** ***************************************************************************= *** *********************888         Please send me an excel spreadsheet which depicts the value that you see=20 associated with the heat rate spread option.  I want to make sure that I=20 understand exactly how you propose valuing the transaction and how this val= ue=20 would be booked.  As such, please provide the following detail:  Will we be valuing/booking a series of monthly call options or a series of= =20 daily call options? What power curve are we valuing the deal against - PJM East or West Hub? Please send me the current fuel curve that you are converting to $/MWh to= =20 value the deal? What volatilities are you using to value the options - monthly volatilities= =20 or intra-day volatilities or a blend of the two (if blending please show me= =20 what formula you using to blend the two vols)? What expiration date are you using, i.e.: for monthly call options the 15th= =20 of the relevant month, and for daily options? What correlation are you assuming, 15% flat for twenty years? Are you deducting all operating expenses from the value of the option? Are you using the ""SPRDOPT"" Exotic Options function to value the option? Are you using the $/MWh VOM dollar amount as your strike? Has Don provided the fixed payment stream?  This stream should be covering= =20 both P&I and not just principal.  Yvan, and Ben, please provide answers to these question via written=20 correspondence so that their is limited probability of misunderstanding. = =20 Thank you both very much for your time and help thus far.  Furthermore, I= =20 would like to reiterate that RAC's goal, prior to quoting any credit reserv= e,=20 is to be 100% confident that: (i) the methodology that is being employed is= =20 consistent among the internal groups; and (ii) the inherent value of the=20 price risk management contracts matches.

"Greetings, Mr. Rogers  My apologies for the delay in responding to your last inquiry - but the entire TEXASMBA Admissions Team is still intently focused on the still remaining pool of fall 2000 applicants requiring consideration for this year's class.  However, let me briefly respond to your note by suggesting that you also address one of the more visible point of need in your competitive admission profile -- that being your GMAT.  I believe you had indicated previously that you chose not to utilize GMAT's services and accommodations for non-standard test takers such as yourself.   I suggest you consider the merits of changing your position in this decision.  As one of the competitive points of consideration within your application profile, it could be to your benefit to address your currently non-competitive score by accepting GMAT's accommodations.   I suggest you request a copy of GMAT's ""Supplement for Testing with Disabilities"" for additional insights into the nature and personal acceptability of these accommodations.

"Hey Ben,  How is life in Texas?  Have you met that guy Rob McDonald I know from DC? He is good friends with my cousin Eddy Quinn.  Life has gotten rather boring out here. We have a ton of work to do and work long hours with no days off. This work style in the beginning made time fly but recently the monotony of the routine has gotten mundane.  We all live for port calls and push the envelope of ethical billing while in port.  I have been shot down by every school I applied for.  How about you?  They can all blow me as I would probably outperform all of those faggots with high GMATs.  That has been my achilles heel.  Right now I am focused on the summer and getting off this ship.  I hope I get in the marathon because I have been training for so long. There is nothing else to do except that in my free time.  If I don't have a goal to shoot for then I could never keep up this training on land.  The summer will be the hardest because I am going to want to travel and visit people when I get back.  Any plans to be in NY this summer?  I have been messing around with stocks too.  I have made only a little since the tech crash.  I stay away from those Internet companies so I didn't get killed.

"Maybe the message is garbled but 4 7FA's and 2 STG's (probably two 2 X 1  CCGT's) should be nominally $470,000,000 based on the Pittsburg CCGT out in  California (but includes no real EPC contractor margin/contingency so will  not match what Nepco or other third parties might bid), would nominally be  480 MW at 95F for each 2 X 1 so about 960 MW for all. I think this works out  to about $489/kW. This based on about $34,000,000 for each GE7FA so pricing  will adjust if market price higher or lower.  I honestly don't and have not seen a 501G price. I did see 701G prices in  Asia and they appeared to be about 5% lower per kilowatt than 701F and  GE9FA's. In this hot market they maybe at a premium due to better heat rate  and larger unit size. I would suggest $515/kW as a go by. I have called John  Garrison to see what current pricing and delivery is - also to see if  performance might be a touch better than our maybe two year old model. Do we  want to get an estimate from Nepco or a benchmark from my estimator's? I  would need a charge number/tasking letter.

It was adjusted from Lowell,  Mass Nepco estimate and we changed format to more closely match  Homestead  form.  Biggest differences 'tween original Plano and original Homestead were:  Homestead had dual fuel     +4M Homestead had additional piling and foundation bulks  +1.8M Homestead was connecting to a complicated t-line config +1.5M Homestead had an FPL substation    +5M Homestead did not need as much gas pipeline    -2.1M Homestead used 6% margin     +4.4M Homestead had lower capacity due to additional chilling  +1.5% (not capital  cost but does change $/kW)  Differences from original Plano to new Plano is that Nepco has estimated a  union job for Lowell. This impacts indirects upward by about $5M and  construction up above my earlier guesstimate by about $4M. I had doubled the  cost per manhour which Nepco also did but additionally they added manhours  for productivity loss. Additionally I moved new Plano margin to 6%.  New Homestead went up due to raw water pretreatment and first stage RO but we  dropped the substation cost so total estimated cost went down by a coupla of  million.  Numbers still just should be used for screening, no commitment.   These summaries should not be passed around.

Unless there  is a compelling reason, we need to conform your Florida model to this model  as (i) it is already an accepted methodology used by the organization, (ii)  it is used as the basis upon which we determine accrual income for our  existing merchant portfolio, and (iii) it will result in more favorable cost  profile in terms of $/kW month than other methodologies.  Please let me know if you have any issues relative to this approach. If not,  please adjust the Florida model and provide me with the results which Mike  and I need to present to Delainey on Friday. It would also be helpful to have  the bid and ask from the desk (5 yr. term) for this presentation. Lastly,  FYI, we have released ICF Kaiser to prepare a forecast specific to the LM6000  configuration (6x and w/wo a 74.9mW steam turbine), which we can then use to  compare to the forecasted cost basis of your model.

Did I miss something or did we not get our share this weekend?  Apparently the weekend only caused Bryan to reflect on his current state of affairs. By chance it was just the welts on his forehead from crushing cans that caused him to start boozing all by his lonesome yesterday. Or perhaps he just wanted to enjoy the perks of first class. Let's hope it was the latter and had nothing to do with the frightful prospect of being a married man in just 6 weeks.

(As per Dave Don Miller's GENCO group should be able to supply us  with their comparable #'s).  Also run the model based on MAIN and ECAR curves ( we have already run the  #'s on Cinergy and West NY).     Produce a graph showing the different curves, including ICF-Kaiser.    Also show a graph comparing Moore's tariff build up (based on the 30 yr  curve) for Fixed and Variable O&M,    principal, interest. etc.  (Jonathan  Hoff should be of great help here).  Miguel:  Get market comps from the Confidential-CSFB study that Don Miller  has giving Asset Pricing comps for Power   Plants (GENCO related).  Also look  to get any other market/asset sales info. we showed to Orion.  Meet with the desk to get the MAIN and ECAR curves Dave has requested we  run. (for Kate's proforma).    Since Miguel is out after Thursday, Adam  should coordinate and follow up in  Miguel's absence.  He also gave us go ahead for the DASH and RAROC. Kate was cleaning up the  DASH and the model to pass on to  Underwriting.  Joe D. and Lisa B. are following up on the Syn. Lease structure getting with  the banks.

In the deal, Enron will provide both gas and electric commodities to Hades' facilities throughout and under North America.  John D. Rockefeller, former CEO of energy monopolist Standard Oil, is now head of Hades' energy management division.  Said Rockefeller, ""Obviously Hell has significant heating demands.  While eternal flames are a great idea in concept, they require vast and reliable fuel resources.  Enron was the only supplier willing to make a deal with my boss, and, as a former monopolist, I just like the way they do business.""  A spokesperson for Enron said the two cultures were able to work easily together during negotiations.  According to the company, ""The deal fits both companies exceptionally well.  With Hades' ability to attract and retain new customers, we see this as a fabulous growth opportunity for millennia to come.""  According to several energy industry insiders, Hades' high heating demand with very little need for summer air conditioning make it a very attractive energy portfolio addition.  Hades is a multinational corporation with millions of sites worldwide and approximately 173 quintillion customers.  The entity boasts sustained high growth rates over the last two thousand years.  Enron is one of the world's leading energy and communications companies. The company owns approximately $37 billion in energy and communications assets.  Enron ranks in the top quarter of Fortune's ""Best 100 Companies to Work For if You Can Keep A Job There and Don't Mind Working 80 Hours A Week,"" and is among the most respected corporations in America, as ranked by customers with respect-us-or-get-curtailed clauses in their energy supply contracts.

I will try to call you later today, but will send this note just in case I miss you.  While I am interested in following up with Tim about our project in the NW, there are two other more pressing reasons for talking with the right guys at Enron. First, we have just secured the rights to a 1600 MW plant in Texas - permitting complete and just about ready for financing. We are also close to securing the rights to a 800 MW project in Oklahoma. So we would like to talk about tolling, etc. for both of those plants.  Also, word on the street is that Enron is not only selling existing generating stations, but also its projects under development. I think I saw a report that your CEO denied this. But, if there is any truth in the statement, we would like to follow up, especially concerning the development sites. It may be possible for us to take over development and have a tie back to Enron for the marketing (and perhaps the operations) of the project.

"My responses to one set of PG&E questions would be as follows.  Dean is  answering the other one and will send back to you directly.  * What is Enron's intent re: continuing involvement?  PG&E is concerned about any potential requirements that they might be required to either purchase fuel from Enron or engage Enron as the power marketer.  RESPONSE: Enron is very flexible re continuing involvement:  scheduling  coordination, fuel supply, power marketing, etc.  We are also flexible re the  time period and the terms of the continuing involvement.  Whatever  arrangement is developed would be mutually beneficial.    * What is status of EPC negotiations.  Will they be required to engage NEPCO as the EPC contractor?  Does the EPC contractor have control over the turbines?  RESPONSE: o EPC negotiations are complete with NEPCO.  Contract has not been  executed, but has been ""put on the shelf"" awaiting decision on successful  bidder for the purchase of the Pastoria project from ENA.  Successful bidder  and NEPCO will each have the option of executing the EPC agreement.    o Successful bidder is under no obligation to engage NEPCO.    o West LB has control of the turbines.  They can be assigned either to the  LLC or to ENA.  (If assigned to ENA, it was because the successful bidder for  the Pastoria project did not want the turbines with the acquisition.)  If  assigned to the LLC as part of the acquisition, the LLC can then assign the  turbines to the ultimate EPC contractor.       * They also questioned whether there would be any ""agricultural restrictions""?  RESPONSE: The project site is presently under a Williamson Act contract to  maintain agricultural use in exchange for lower taxes.  Last week, the Kern  County Board of Supervisors voted to cancel the Williamson Act contract to  allow for industrial use, which started a 180 day public comment period.   However, the Governor has on his desk a bill for signature that would reduce  the public comment period for the cancellation to the same time frame as the  request for rehearing period for the CEC Final Decision.  (The Governor has  until 9/30 sign the bill and is expected to do so because of the overwhelming  support of the bill in the Assembly and the Senate.)  The cancellation will  be contingent upon a successful CEC decision and a payment of a Williamson  Act cancellation fee.

They are planning to bid on the peakers and LV Cogen on Friday.

Dean is  answering the other one and will send back to you directly.  * What is Enron's intent re: continuing involvement?  PG&E is concerned about any potential requirements that they might be required to either purchase fuel from Enron or engage Enron as the power marketer.  RESPONSE: Enron is very flexible re continuing involvement:  scheduling  coordination, fuel supply, power marketing, etc.  We are also flexible re the  time period and the terms of the continuing involvement.  Whatever  arrangement is developed would be mutually beneficial.    * What is status of EPC negotiations.  Will they be required to engage NEPCO as the EPC contractor?  Does the EPC contractor have control over the turbines?  RESPONSE: o EPC negotiations are complete with NEPCO.  Contract has not been  executed, but has been ""put on the shelf"" awaiting decision on successful  bidder for the purchase of the Pastoria project from ENA.  Successful bidder  and NEPCO will each have the option of executing the EPC agreement.    o Successful bidder is under no obligation to engage NEPCO.    o West LB has control of the turbines.  They can be assigned either to the  LLC or to ENA.  (If assigned to ENA, it was because the successful bidder for  the Pastoria project did not want the turbines with the acquisition.)  If  assigned to the LLC as part of the acquisition, the LLC can then assign the  turbines to the ultimate EPC contractor.       * They also questioned whether there would be any ""agricultural restrictions""?  RESPONSE: The project site is presently under a Williamson Act contract to  maintain agricultural use in exchange for lower taxes.  Last week, the Kern  County Board of Supervisors voted to cancel the Williamson Act contract to  allow for industrial use, which started a 180 day public comment period.   However, the Governor has on his desk a bill for signature that would reduce  the public comment period for the cancellation to the same time frame as the  request for rehearing period for the CEC Final Decision.  (The Governor has  until 9/30 sign the bill and is expected to do so because of the overwhelming  support of the bill in the Assembly and the Senate.)  The cancellation will  be contingent upon a successful CEC decision and a payment of a Williamson  Act cancellation fee.

"Professor Titman:  I hope you had an enjoyable summer and it didn't go too quickly.   I hope  you remember who I am from last years application process.  I enjoyed meeting  you last year and talking with  you regarding the curriculum and admissions  process.  I wanted to let you know that I am still very much interested in  attending the Business School.    I took your advice this summer and took a graduate level finance class  (Financial Management), which I received an A.  I was very pleased with  myself, because I had not taken this type of class in quite some time.  I  have decided to take another graduate level finance class (Macroeconomics),  which I am currently taking and runs through December.    I also sent my information regarding my learning disability into GMAC to try  and receive a ""special testing status"" for the GMAT.   I am currently waiting  to hear back from them with their decision.  As you can see, I am still very much interested in attending the Business  School for next year and I'm in the process of doing whatever I can to  increase my application profile.  I am also sending an e-mail to Carl Harris,  who heads up the admissions process  to inform him of these recent  developments.   Please let me know if there is anything else you think I need to do to  enhance my application profile.

"Dear Ben:  Its nice hearing that you are doing well and that you are taking MBA finance classes --- are these at U. of Houston?  The admissions people mentioned that your GMAT score was too low when you applied last year.  They said that if you had a higher GMAT score we could consider you as a special case because of your background in energy finance.  Basically, my impression was that you didn't need to have a score close to the 660 median, but you need to improve a lot.  I would also recommend that you work more on the quantitative sections, since it is clear to me that your verbal skills are quite good.

By Tom Jacobs  British-based drug producer SmithKline Beecham (NYSE: SBH) announced today that it would swallow New Jersey's oral products maker Block Drug (Nasdaq: BLOCA) for $1.24 billion. SmithKline will pay $53 a share for Block, which closed Friday at $50.63, up 0.75%. SmithKline ended the week at $67.44, a mere 5% under its 52-week high.  SmithKline is expanding its consumer business while competitors such as Bristol-Myers Squibb (NYSE: BMY) are shedding theirs to focus on drugs. SmithKline already earns one-third of its revenues from consumer products, which include Aquafresh toothpaste, and now adds Block's Sensodyne toothpaste and Polident denture cleaner brands. Commentators speculate that SmithKline is keeping a consumer division to better deliver non-prescription versions of its own drugs that have lost patent protection, or that the Block buyout better positions SmithKline to spin off its consumer division.  At the same time, the British drug powerhouse is pushing into genomics: It has joined a new public-private consortium to fund efforts to decode mouse DNA within the next six months. The $53 million Mouse Sequencing Consortium includes SmithKline, Affymetrix (Nasdaq: AFFX), the Merck Genome Research Institute, the U.S. National Institutes of Health, and the British-based Wellcome Trust. Like its sibling the SNP Consortium, the Mouse confab hopes to speed genomic data into the public domain. Celera Genomics (NYSE: CRA) and other companies are competing to sequence the mouse genome and SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphisms) to sell in proprietary databases. http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=147835  Surrounding these events is the pending merger of SmithKline with larger drug maker Glaxo Wellcome (NYSE: GLX). The two await regulatory approval to create the world's second-largest pharmaceutical firm with a $180 billion market cap. Perhaps because of their experience -- the Federal Trade Commission has delayed the merger twice and now won't rule until the end of the year -- SmithKline hasn't announced a target date to close the Block deal. _________________________________________________________________  NEWS TO GO  Reuters reports that General Motors (NYSE: GM) and Fiat are joining forces for talks to purchase some or all of ailing South Korean car maker Daewoo. Daewoo Motor is one of 12 units of Daewoo Group, which creditors rescued in August and seek to shore up. Ford beat out GM in June for exclusive talks with Daewoo, but Ford ended negotiations in September. GM and Daewoo Motors have been around the block before -- several times. Their 15-year alliance ended in 1992.  City delivery speedsters Kozmo.com and Urbanfetch.com are talking a Kozmo buyout again, according to The New York Times. Kozmo has not been the most ardent suitor: It sued Urbanfetch before it opened last year and settled out of court. The parties have bailed from previous talks at the last minute. The Times' sources state that the new company would hope to go public in the next year -- if the Internet IPO market turns up.  Facing tomorrow's announcement of latest quarter earnings, biotech drug maker Biogen (Nasdaq: BGEN) licensed five new drug targets from genomics drug discovery company CuraGen (Nasdaq: CRGN). Biogen has been criticized for the weakness of its drug development pipeline, and the CuraGen deal gives Biogen a jump start at the early stages of the pipeline -- five targets against which to test possible drug candidates. Biogen also announced a management realignment Friday.  A new gene bank, the First Genetic Trust, will open to allay people's reluctance to share their genetic data with researchers. Arthur Holden, chair of the SNP Consortium and Mouse Consortium (see lead story above), will form the bank with David Wang, former head of genomics and bioinformatics at Motorola (NYSE: MOT), and Andrea Califano, former computational biology director at IBM (NYSE: IBM). The bank would perform two main functions designed to keep individual information private, assuage fears that information could be used to deny employment or insurance, and increase efficiency. The bank would provide analysis results to researchers, but not the individual genetic data, and patients could authorize the bank to give their doctors access to a patient's DNA account for prescription purposes instead of having to test patients each time. http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=147836  Enjoy Friday's Foolish market wrap-up with one swift click! http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=147837 _________________________________________________________________  EDITOR'S PICK  Your favorite stock takes a nosedive and you want to sell it, take a tax loss, and buy it back at the lower price.

By LouAnn Lofton  Biotech company Biogen (Nasdaq: BGEN) reported its third-quarter (ended September 30) results yesterday after the bell. The company's revenues climbed by 12% to $233.7 million. Net income for the quarter was $68.3 million, or 10% higher than the $62 million Biogen earned in the year-ago period.  Earnings per share came in ahead of estimates by a penny at $0.44. The consensus First Call/Thompson Financial estimate for the company was $0.43. In its third quarter last year, Biogen earned $0.39 a share.  Biogen's main revenue driver is Avonex, a drug used in the treatment of multiple sclerosis. For its third quarter, sales of Avonex rose 18% to $193 million. In fiscal 1999, Avonex sales accounted for 78% of Biogen's revenues. The company said that more than 93,000 patients worldwide are now using the drug. It did acknowledge in a conference call, though, that the U.S. market for Avonex is slowing.  Avonex also faces increased overseas competition in the multiple sclerosis drug market. Here in the U.S., Avonex is protected from competition until 2003. Biogen is working to develop additional drugs (which it hopes will turn into additional sources of revenue) through projects such as collaborations with Irish drug company Elan (NYSE: ELN). The company also recently licensed five new drug targets from CuraGen (Nasdaq: CRGN).  Biogen's president and chief executive officer, James C. Mullen, said, ""We continue with aggressive development of our pipeline products. During the past quarter, we intensified our investment in the important new platform technology of genomics and expanded our long-term pipeline capabilities and basic research programs with several collaborative agreements.""

Registration ends today! http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=150885 _________________________________________________________________  NEWS TO GO  Hard driver manufacturer Seagate Technology (NYSE: SEG) announced its fiscal 2001 first-quarter earnings yesterday after the close. Pro forma net income for the quarter was $62 million on revenue of $1.748 billion. Pro forma diluted earnings per share came in at $0.26, which bested the Street's expectations by a nickel.  PacifiCare Health Systems (Nasdaq: PHSY), a provider of managed healthcare, told the Street yesterday that it sees its third-quarter results coming in significantly below expectations. The company expects earnings per share for the third quarter to come in between breakeven and a loss of as much as $0.10 a share. Analysts were looking for PacifiCare to report third-quarter earnings per share of $1.90, according to First Call/Thompson Financial. The company blamed higher-than-expected medical costs for its shortfall.  The on-again, off-again talks between online delivery service companies Urbanfetch.com and Kozmo.com are off again. Urbanfetch.com said yesterday that it's halted negotiations to be acquired by competitor Kozmo.com. Ross Stevens, the chief executive of Urbanfetch.com, said, ""We just didn't think Kozmo had a profitable model, and we didn't think that Urbanfetch Express would get the attention it needed.""  Ford Motor Company (NYSE: F) says that an analysis of accidents involving its Explorer sport utility vehicles was flawed, according to The Washington Post. The analysis, which was carried out by the Post and reported in Monday's edition of the paper, found that Explorers have higher rates of tire-related crashes even when the trucks are equipped with non-recalled Goodyear tires. The analysis was carried out by looking at which plants produced the Explorers, and what type of tire came on the trucks from that particular plant. According to Ford, the plants the company originally thought were putting just Goodyear tires on Explorers were actually putting Firestone tires on about 4% of the vehicles. Ford's vice president of communications, Jason Vines, was quoted as saying that this new information ""repudiates the premise of the analysis.""

Barkley   REDBACK RAMPS UP The network equipment maker quadruples revenues and reports its first pro forma profit.  By Chris Rugaber  Network equipment maker Redback Networks (Nasdaq: RBAK) reported third-quarter results after yesterday's market close, almost quadrupling revenues to $80.6 million from last year's $20.6 million. On a pro forma basis, Redback eked out $3.2 million in profit, or $0.02 per share, ahead of analysts' consensus estimates of a $0.02 per share loss.  Including costs related to its acquisitions of Siara Systems and Abatis Systems, as well as stock compensation expenses, the company reported a loss of $308.1 million, or $2.50 per share.  Redback makes subscriber management systems that enable telecom service providers to handle heavy traffic on high-speed networks, including cable, DSL, and wireless connections. The company also recently began ramping up sales of its optical networking products, which are being used in regional fiber optic networks.  The company, which was a Daily Double this spring, added 70 new customers during the quarter, bringing its total to more than 300. This is particularly important for a company like Redback, since many small networking equipment companies rely inordinately on only a few customers, and can get slammed if just one or two buyers delay or cancel a purchase. This may still be an issue for Redback, however. While the company added Qwest Communications' (NYSE: Q) U S West unit as a new customer, the former Baby Bell accounted for 24% of the company's revenues in the quarter. http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=152397  Redback's CFO Craig Genter told analysts in a conference call that revenues should hit $100 million next quarter, and continue to grow 20% each quarter next year. As a result, the company expects sales to hit $645 million in 2001. While such growth is impressive, at a market cap of $19 billion, the market clearly expects great things from the company. _________________________________________________________________  NEWS TO GO  Among the many companies reporting earnings last night was Advanced Micro Devices (NYSE: AMD), which beat analysts' consensus estimates by two pennies. The microprocessor and flash memory maker reported net income (excluding onetime charges) of $219 million, or $0.64 per share, and sales of $1.2 billion. For more info, check out yesterday's news report. http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=152398  Motorcycle maker Harley Davidson (NYSE: HDI) reported a solid third quarter yesterday. Net income reached $83 million, or $0.27 per share, a 27% increase over last year's $65.4 million, or $0.21 per share. Sales were up 15% to $714.1 million. The company, which makes over 25% of the heavyweight bikes sold worldwide, shipped 48,077 motorcycles in the quarter, 13% more than the year-earlier period, and expects to ship 203,000 this year. However, sales did fall 38% in the company's Buell division, which makes a lightweight bike called the Blast, and which just maybe doesn't appeal to Harley's regular customers. For more information on Harley Davidson, check out the Drip Portfolio's recent analysis of the company. http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=152399  Fiber optic cable and components maker Corning (NYSE: GLW) announced yesterday that third-quarter earnings would beat analysts' estimates, thanks to strong demand. The company expects to report earnings per share (EPS) of $0.34-$0.35 for the quarter, 75% above last year's figure and ahead of consensus estimates of $0.30 per share. For more information on fiber optics components, be sure to check out our new Internet Report on the subject. http://www.lnksrv.com/m.asp?i=152400  Warehouse club operator Costco Wholesale (Nasdaq: COST) reported a 9% increase in fourth-quarter profit yesterday. Earnings reached $200.2 million, or $0.43 per share, 10% higher than the $0.39 per share reached a year ago. Sales rose 20% to $10.6 billion for the quarter. Same-store sales -- sales at warehouses open at least a year -- were up 9%. http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=152401  Fast food company Tricon Global Restaurants (NYSE: YUM) announced mixed third-quarter results last night, with net income up 2.7% to $115 million, or $0.77 per share, ahead of analysts' consensus estimates of $0.70. However, revenues declined 8.5% to $1.66 billion from $1.81 billion in the year-earlier period. The operator of Pizza Hut, Taco Bell, and KFC restaurants also reported that same-store sales rose 1% at Pizza Hut, fell 2% at Taco Bell (probably thanks to all that great publicity over recalled shells), and were ""little changed"" at KFC. http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=152402  Finally, home improvement chain Home Depot (NYSE: HD) warned today that third-quarter earnings will be below expectations, thanks to lower prices for lumber and other building materials. Profits should reach $0.28 per share, less than the $0.31 per share expected by analysts. Same-store sales should increase 4%, below the 5% to 7% the company previously forecasted.

The opposite of talking is waiting."" -- Fran Lebowitz   GATEWAY BUSTS OUT WITH STRONG Q3 The personal computer maker reported third-quarter earnings after the close yesterday, reaffirming its beyond-the-box strategy.  By Mike Trigg  Personal computer (PC) maker Gateway (NYSE: GTW) announced earnings in line with Street expectations after the market's close yesterday, citing strong consumer and small business sales and continued growth in Europe. After warnings from stalwart technology firms Intel (Nasdaq: INTC), Dell (Nasdaq: DELL), and Apple (Nasdaq: AAPL) sent PC stocks tumbling in recent weeks, the news was an affirmation of the company's beyond-the-box business strategy.  Gateway reported fiscal third-quarter (ended September 30) net income of $152.6 million, or $0.46 per share, compared to $113.2 million, or $0.35 per share, one year ago. A quick look at profits shows this was its third consecutive quarter of 30%-plus net income growth.  On the revenue side, the San Diego, Ca. company reported sales of $2.53 billion, an increase of 16% from $2.18 billion in the same period a year ago. As a percentage of sales, gross margins improved one percentage point from the year-ago period to 23.1%. Here, we begin to see the effect of the company's strategy of diversifying its product offering.  More than 50% of sales from the quarter came from hardware, software, and services other than the PC. This exceeded company expectations, which called for 45% by the end of the fourth quarter. By gaining traction with its beyond-the-box strategy, the company sets itself up for further margin expansion. Non-PC products and services are high-margin businesses, thus allowing a greater proportion of sales to trickle down to the bottom line. CFO John Todd discussed this subject in the conference call last night, noting the company sees a day when the majority of revenues come from products and services outside the box.  Internationally, revenues in the Middle East, Europe, and Africa increased 13%. The company indicated that, without currency difficulties, top-line growth would have seen a 27% year-over-year improvement. Moreover, Gateway's Asia Pacific arm saw an 8% growth in revenue and was adversely affected by problems with suppliers of disk drives, which have since been solved.  This quarter was especially good for Gateway. Next quarter is typically its strongest, and the company is comfortable with the consensus estimate calling for 48% profit growth. The consumer segment and software revenue related to the PC will continue to drive growth in coming quarters _________________________________________________________________  NEWS TO GO  Internet router provider Juniper Networks (Nasdaq: JNPR) announced fiscal third-quarter net income of $58.2 million, or $0.17 per share, compared to a loss of $1.6 million, or $0.01 per share, year-over-year. The Street consensus called for the company to earn $0.09 per share. Revenue was $201.2 million, a 78% sequential increase. CEO Scott Kriens cited strong demand among service providers to handle the increased amount of Internet traffic. The company directly competes with Cisco (Nasdaq: CSCO) and is gaining serious market traction in the space, which apparently hasn't been affected by the technology slowdown.  Data availability software provider Veritas (Nasdaq: VRTS) reported better-than-expected earnings after the market's close yesterday, citing continued international strength, steady revenue, and market share growth in the Windows NT space, and expansion of its Unix business. Veritas' fiscal third-quarter net income excluding adjustments was $70.3 million, or $0.16 per share, compared to $38.9 million, or $0.09 per share, a year ago. The Street consensus called for the company to earn $0.14 per share. CFO Ken Lonchar added in a prepared release that the company continues to see strong growth of its Hewlett-Packard (NYSE: HWP) business.  Internet advertising company DoubleClick (Nasdaq: DCLK) announced third-quarter earnings after the close yesterday in line with Street expectations.

Specifically, the media unit reported revenue of $64.3 million, an 86% increase. The number of advertisers fell 10% from the prior quarter. Moreover, it maintained a bearish outlook for the rest of the year, adding that current conditions likely won't change till the second quarter of next year.  Communications chip maker PMC-Sierra (Nasdaq: PMCS) reported that fiscal third-quarter profits had tripled, citing strong sales to makers of computer networking gear. The company also forecasted that sales would rise 15% in the next period.

Jackson   CHEVRON GUZZLES TEXACO Two U.S. oil powers agreed this weekend to form the world's fourth-largest oil and gas company.  By Tom Jacobs  The Texaco (NYSE: TX) board yesterday approved Chevron's (NYSE: CHV) $35.1 billion stock purchase offer. The deal between the No. 2 and No. 3 U.S. oil companies would create the fourth-largest world oil and gas concern, Chevron Texaco, and increase competition for world leader Exxon Mobil (NYSE: XOM).  Chevron will pay 0.77 of a share for each Texaco share and assume $8 billion in debt, for a total of $45.4 billion. The per-share price -- slightly higher than the 0.765 that Chevron offered in 1999 talks that stalled -- values Texaco at $64.87, an 18% premium to its Friday close of $55.13. Chevron shareholders will have 61% control of Chevron Texaco and nine of the 15 board seats.  Attention immediately focused on regulatory and political obstacles to the marriage. The new company would have major control of West Coast refining capacity and gas stations. Middle East upheavals could bring political scrutiny as well. But the new company's $85 billion market capitalization appears puny compared to BP Amoco's (NYSE: BP) $207 billion, and the smaller Chevron Texaco would arguably pose less of a threat to world gas prices.  Texaco abruptly broke off prior merger talks in June 1999, allegedly due to bad chemistry between former Chevron CEO Kenneth Derr and Texaco Chairman Peter Bijur. Derr has since retired. The new CEO, David O'Reilly, assumed command nine months ago and reportedly has good relations with Bijur, including several golf dates. Reilly would be CEO of the new combined entity and Bijur would stay on as number two.  The deal came just days after Texaco purchased General Motors' (NYSE: GM) interest in GM Ovonic, a joint venture between GM and Ovonic Battery Company, a subsidiary of Energy Conversion Devices (Nasdaq: ENER). Ovonic Battery was the originator of nickel metal hydride (NiMH) batteries for electric and hybrid vehicles. The joint venture develops production and manufacturing processes to commercialize the NiMH battery technology for use in 2003 model year cars. Texaco's share of the joint venture is 50%, adding to its 20% ownership of Energy Conversion Devices. There is no information whether the Chevron purchase will affect this deal.  All told, the deal looks good for Texaco. Though both companies' revenues are approximately $36 billion, Texaco's profits are 60% of Chevron's. On Friday's huge up day, Texaco closed at $55.13, off $1.88, while Chevron shed $3.06 to finish at $84.25. _________________________________________________________________  NEWS TO GO  European regulators switched course Friday and approved Vivendi's (NYSE: V) $34 billion acquisition of Canada's Seagram (NYSE: VO), after the European Commission indicated it might subject the deal to a time-consuming further investigation. The key shift occurred when Vivendi agreed not to discriminate against competitors seeking access to Seagram's Universal unit's film and music libraries. Observers are surprised that this deal practically flew by in comparison with the five-month probe of the Time Warner (NYSE: TWX)-America Online (NYSE: AOL) deal.  Qualcomm's (Nasdaq: QCOM) on-again, off-again affair with China Unicom over increased Chinese penetration of Qualcomm's CDMA (code division multiple access) wireless technology is back on. The companies announced that they will join Shenzhen Zhongxing Telecom, the leading Chinese CDMA phone equipment manufacturer, to produce a CDMA handset for sale in China. A cool feature is that it allows users to remove subscriber identification module cards and switch phones, and retain their number and service. Would be a good idea for the U.S., wouldn't it? Dream on.  Continental Airlines (NYSE: CAL) announced today third-quarter earnings of $2.24 a share, a 54% jump over last year. This exceeded First Call consensus estimates of $2.19 a share (click here for a Foolish take on earnings estimates). The company trumpeted its 22nd consecutive profitable quarter. Passenger revenue increased in every geographic market, ranging from 12.2% domestically and 27.9% for transatlantic traffic. http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=155936  Continental may be smiling, but Delta Airlines (NYSE: DAL) isn't. Its pilots' contract proposal seeks huge pay increases and parity with pilots for United Airlines (NYSE: UAL). The pilots agreed in 1996 to a 2% pay cut and other work concessions to assist Delta's turnaround. They now want 30-49% raises over three years, which would bring basic pay for a 777 captain with 12 years experience to $267,600. (Would we feel safer?) Gregg Holm, a spokesman for the Air Line Pilots Association, called this ""United [Airlines] plus.""

Suppose your errors were counted and published every day, like those of a baseball player."" -- Anonymous   BROADVISION SAYS, ""THANK YOU, PAINEWEBBER"" BroadVision lands on the S&P 500. Index fund managers set phasers to &""Buy.""  By Rick Aristotle Munarriz  ""Thank you, PaineWebber!""  That's the heartfelt gratitude coming from the BroadVision (Nasdaq: BVSN) camp this morning after the e-commerce software specialist was named the latest addition to the S&P 500.  The vacancy sign lit up after German financial titan UBS (NYSE: UBS) agreed to acquire index member PaineWebber (NYSE: PWJ), the fourth-largest domestic brokerage services company. The transition will take place on Monday.  In a world where quality companies are acquired or fade away, next week's index adjustment is hardly a rare event. Turnover comes with the territory. There have been 178 company changes within the S&P 500 over the pas five years, with no less than two dozen switches in any given year during that time. http://www.lnksrv.com/m.asp?i=157948  The process isn't that far removed from such events as getting into a hot New York City nightspot during peak party hours or landing Green Bay Packers season tickets. Someone has to bow out first, by will or misconduct, and then the thorough selection process begins. Making it to the end of the velvet rope or the top of the waiting list is an honor. While BroadVision's shares are nearly 75% off their March highs, the index inclusion provides some sort of market validation.  Since the S&P 500 is a weighted index, BroadVision's new role may seem inconsequential. The stock will make up just 0.05% (or 1/2,000th) of the index's total market capitalization. But the numbers add up in a hurry. With speculators trying to jump the gun before the index-based vehicles adjust their portfolios, the buy orders should be streaming in this week. For instance, the $105 billion Vanguard 500 Index Fund alone will have to buy up at least a $50 million stake in BroadVision come Monday.  So PaineWebber, whose mutual funds were ranked 100 out of 101 fund families by SmartMoney this year, finally found a way to enrich investors -- BroadVision's shareholders. http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=157949 _________________________________________________________________  NEWS TO GO  Earning disappointments are a disease and McAfee (Nasdaq: MCAF) has the cure. The anti-virus software company reported a narrower loss than expected (before non-cash charges) on an 86% spike in revenues. Users have taken to safe computing as a result of well-publicized viral outbreaks such as the ""I Love You"" virus earlier this year. Traffic at the McAfee site has now grown to 400,000 daily, and the company has lined up 650,000 paying subscribers. McAfee is majority-owned by Network Associates (Nasdaq: NETA), which also announced better-than-expected earnings.  From a whisper number to a scream, shares of chip maker Altera (Nasdaq: ALTR) should open lower this morning after the company reported third-quarter results. While the $0.28-a-share showing was in line with estimates, it came a penny shy of Wall Street's whisper number. If no one wants to step in and pick up shares at half the price they were fetching just last month, Altera will. The company doubled its buyback plans from 24 million shares to 48 million. That means that as much as 9% of the outstanding stock might be bought back in the open market. http://www.lnksrv.com/m.asp?i=157950  Drive-in theaters might have become flea market stomping grounds, but drive-in restaurants are motoring. Burger-to-your-car chain Sonic (Nasdaq: SONC) closed out a strong fiscal 2000 with earnings of $1.75 a share. The fast-food firm earned $1.41 the year before. Unit production remains lettuce-crisp. Sonic has grown same-store sales for 14 consecutive years now.  Merrill Lynch (NYSE: MER) reported analyst-topping earnings despite a slowdown in its investment banking division. Earnings climbed by 52% to $0.94 a share -- eight pennies above projections. With tensions running high given recent market volatility, the company was able to grow commissions to 26% of quarterly revenues. In boxing terms, this is a TKO.  Historians marvel at Galileo, and now Marvell Tech (Nasdaq: MRVL) wants Galileo Tech (Nasdaq: GALT). In a $2.7 billion proposed stock swap, Marvell will offer 0.674 of a share for each share of the Israeli semiconductor company. Though the original Galileo -- 17th century Italian philosopher and astronomer Galileo Galilei -- was an independent thinker, Galileo Tech will no longer be an independent company.

Because if you are interested in refreshing and are within the guarantee, you can sit through again for free and get extra help from your instructor. You have the right to re-take the course as long as you have taken all of your practice tests, attended all classes or made up if you missed, done all homework and took your actual exam within 30 days.

By LouAnn Lofton  Digital subscriber line (DSL) solutions provider Copper Mountain Networks (Nasdaq: CMTN) announced its third-quarter results yesterday after the bell. The company also provided some guidance for its fourth quarter and for its next fiscal year that sent its stock tumbling more than 50% to around $12 in after-hours trading. Copper Mountain closed in regular trading yesterday at $26.88, far below the 52-week high it reached back in July of $125.72.  For its third quarter, Copper Mountain had revenues of $93.5 million, 192% ahead of the $32 million it earned in the same quarter a year ago. Pro forma net income, which excludes two charges, was $15.8 million. The company's net income last year in the third quarter was $5.3 million.  Copper Mountain's pro forma earnings per diluted share came in a penny ahead of the consensus estimate at $0.27. Third-quarter earnings per share a year ago were $0.09.  Now, for the stuff that sent the company's stock plummeting in after-hours trading. Rick Gilbert, Copper Mountain's president and chief executive officer, said, ""In light of recent reductions in capital expenditure forecasts from many of our CLEC [Competitive Local Exchange Carriers] customers, we expect revenue and earnings to decline in the fourth quarter of 2000 on a sequential basis.""  Just how big will the ""decline"" be? Copper Mountain now expects sales to be $60 million for the fourth quarter. It sees pro forma earnings per share coming in between $0.04 and $0.06. Analysts had been looking for $0.28 a share.  Gilbert went on to talk about his company's expected fiscal 2001 results. While pointing out that giving guidance that far out is very difficult, he said he expects sales for fiscal 2001 to be between $300 million and $330 million. Earnings per share should be between $0.16 and $0.25. Street analysts were expecting $1.37 a share for Copper Mountain's fiscal 2001.  AFTER-HOURS COVERAGE  INTEL VS. ADVANCED MICRO By Brian Lund Intel's revenue warning in September turned out to be cosmetic. Revenue growth was still strong, margins improved meaningfully, and earnings came in at original expectations. Intel continues to dominate its main competitor, AMD. FULL STORY http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=159576 _________________________________________________________________  NEWS TO GO  RF Micro Devices (Nasdaq: RFMD), the wireless communications amplifying chip maker, announced its second-quarter earnings yesterday, and also talked about its expected third-quarter results. For its Q2, the company met estimates with $0.10 a share. Net income was $17.7 million on revenues of $102.2 million. Last year in the second quarter, RF Micro Devices earned $12.5 million on revenues of $68.9 million, or $0.07. The company then said it was lowering expectations for the third quarter because of low demand for its products, as well as product delays. It expects earnings per share to be between $0.04 and $0.05 a share. Analysts were looking for $0.11 a share.  International Business Machines (NYSE: IBM) reported its third-quarter earnings after the market's close yesterday. Sales grew by 3% to $21.8 billion. This wasn't enough to satisfy analysts, who were looking for sales to come in at $22.4 billion. Net income for the quarter rose to $2 billion, from $1.7 billion in the same quarter last year. Earnings per share were $1.08, versus $0.90 a share last year. This EPS number met the consensus estimate as reported by First Call/Thompson Financial. IBM blamed at least some of the weak revenue growth on an anemic euro. The company claimed its sales would have risen 6% without those negative currency effects.  Chip maker Xilinx (Nasdaq: XLNX) announced its second-quarter earnings yesterday after the bell. The company's revenues grew 83% to $437.4 million, from $238.8 million in its second quarter last year. Net income was $114.1 million, compared to $59.2 million a year ago. Earnings per share beat the consensus estimate by two cents, coming in at $0.32, versus $0.17 last year.  Handspring (Nasdaq: HAND) reported its first-quarter results yesterday afternoon. The company's loss was narrower than expected. Excluding some deferred stock compensation costs, Handspring lost $8 million, or $0.08 a share. Analysts polled by First Call/Thompson Financial expected it to lose $0.12 a share. Including those costs, the company lost $0.17 a share, or $16.4 million. Handspring's revenues for the quarter were $70.5 million.  Covad Communications Group (Nasdaq: COVD) announced its third-quarter earnings results yesterday. Revenues were $66.7 million, compared to revenues in the year-ago period of $19.1 million. Covad's net loss was $189.9 million, versus a loss of $54.1 million the year before. The company's net loss of $1.22 per share was greater than the consensus estimate of $1.18 per share. In Covad's third quarter last year, it lost $0.47 a share. Covad's chief executive officer, Robert Knowling, pointed to his company's clients as the reason the shortfall. ""Due to the weakness in the capital markets, nine of our channel partners have experienced financing difficulties and have slipped in their ability to stay current with their accounts receivable. To conservatively account for this, despite billing $78.1 million in revenue for the third quarter, only $66.7 million was recorded.""

Invest with a brand you know and  trust!  http://www.lnksrv.com/m.asp?i=3D159942   ASK THE FOOL  -- Q. I've just learned that Levi Strauss is a private company, so I can't buy shares of it. What other major companies are privately held?  -- A. Take a gander at these biggies: Cargill, Mars, Bertelsmann AG, Bechtel, Publix Supermarkets, IKEA International, Amway, Penske, S.C. Johnson & Sons, Montgomery Ward Holding Co., Packard Bell NEC, Enterprise Rent-A-Car, Hallmark Cards, Borden, McCain Foods, Hyatt, Hechinger and Domino's Pizza. Some of these firms offer shares to employees, but individual investors are out of luck.  -- Q. I've noticed that stocks jump in price when they're added to the S&P 500 Index. Why is this, and is there any way to learn which companies will be added in the future?  -- A. You've noticed correctly. When it was announced recently that America Online would be added to the S&P 500, its shares quickly rose about 12 percent.  Stocks get added to these indexes to replace ones deemed no longer worthy of being included, or ones that have merged with other companies and therefore disappear. The announcements draw the attention of investors, sending share prices up. And once the companies are added, index funds that will have to own these stocks begin snapping up shares.  Unfortunately, the stocks begin moving as soon as the announcements are made, before they're even officially added. So there's little time to sneak in and benefit. But if you've invested in high-quality, growing companies, chances are you may eventually see some of them added to important indexes.  Got some questions of your own for the Fool?

Stocks don't become more inexpensive when they split. True, you get more shares. But each is worth less. Imagine you own 100 shares of Sisyphus Transport Corp. (ticker: UPDWN). They're trading at $60 each and total $6,000. When Sisyphus splits 2-for-1, you'll own 200 shares, worth about $30 each. Total value: (drum roll, please) $6,000. Yawn.  Some people drool over stocks about to split, thinking the price will surge. Stock prices sometimes do pop a little on news of splits. But these are artificial moves, sustainable only if the businesses grow to justify them. The real reason to smile at a split announcement is because it signals that management is bullish. They're not likely to split their stock if they expect the price to go down.  Splits come in many varieties, such as 3-for-2 or 4-for-1. There's even a ""reverse split,"" when you end up with fewer shares, with each worth more. Reverse splits are usually employed by companies in trouble, to avoid looking like the penny stocks they are. If a stock is trading at a red-flag-raising $2 per share and it does a reverse 1-for-10 split, the price will rise to $20 and those who held 100 shares will then own 10.  Companies often split their stock so that the price will remain psychologically appealing. Sometimes, not splitting would mean that few people could afford even a single share. If Microsoft hadn't split seven times in the last decade, each share would be worth more than $6,500.  With stocks, just as with any purchase, examine what you're getting for the price. Study the company and compare the stock price to other numbers, such as earnings. A low price might be inviting, but a $200 stock can be much more of a bargain than a $20 one. If your funds are limited, you can just buy fewer shares.  It's always fun to suddenly own more shares, but splits are like getting change for a dollar. They're not cause for celebration. _________________________________________________________________  IN THE SPOTLIGHT  -- If you'd like to learn more about various indexes such as the S&P 500 (and what companies are in them), pop over to our collection of index resources. http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=3D159945  -- Do your friends and relatives (and us) a favor -- introduce them to the Fool.

By Chris Rugaber  Finnish mobile handset manufacturer and Rule Maker Nokia (NYSE: NOK) reported third-quarter earnings this morning, coming in significantly higher than analysts' expectations. The company also issued positive forecasts for next quarter and for mobile phone sales in 2001. Nokia was scheduled to report earnings next week, but apparently decided to do so earlier in response to the recent volatility in technology and telecom shares. http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=161169  Sales rose 50% over last year's third quarter to 7.57 billion euros ($6.38 billion), while net income jumped 40% to 892 million euros ($752.22 million), or 0.19 per share. Pretax profit increased 43% to 1.34 billion euros ($1.13 billion), ahead of analysts' forecasts of 1.06 billion.  Nokia's shares had declined about 40% since the company's July warning that third-quarter profit would be lower than the second quarter's, due to product delays. Today's report, and the company's optimistic outlook, reversed that trend, with shares up 18% in European trading.  Mobile phone sales, which account for almost three-quarters of the company's revenues, increased 59%, while operating profits for the division were up 42% to 1.07 billion euros ($900 million). Operating margin decreased to 19.6%, from 21.9%, though the company remains far ahead of No. 2 mobile phone maker Motorola (NYSE: MOT), which recently posted a 6% operating margin for its cell phone division.  Nokia introduced seven new handset models in the third quarter, and the company believes it increased its handset market share, which stood at 27.5% at the end of the second quarter. Motorola controlled 15.6% and Ericsson (Nasdaq: ERICY), which reports earnings tomorrow, held 10.3%.  While other mobile phone companies, such as Motorola and Matsushita, have reduced their projections for industrywide handset sales, Nokia maintained a positive outlook. ""Our view of the market development fundamentals remains unchanged, with more than 400 million mobile phones estimated to be sold in 2000,"" said CEO Jorma Olilla in a prepared statement. ""For 2001 we expect the mobile phone market to be in the region of 550 million units."" Olilla also stated that as a result of these figures, the company expects there will be 1 billion mobile phone users by 2002.  Sales in the company's wireless infrastructure unit were also strong, with revenues up 34% to 1.92 billion euros and operating margins improving to 18.1% from 17.3%. Overall, the company expects ""record-breaking"" earnings per share (EPS) for the fourth quarter, and 25-35% sales growth in 2001.  AFTER-HOURS COVERAGE  TECH HEAVIES REPORT EARNINGS By The Motley Fool Staff A number of top companies reported earnings last night after the bell. Check out our after-hours coverage for news on Microsoft (Nasdaq: MSFT), Akamai (Nasdaq: AKAM), America Online (NYSE: AOL), Apple (Nasdaq: AAPL), and several other companies, many that don't begin with A. FULL STORY>> http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=161170 _________________________________________________________________  NEWS TO GO  Network switch-maker Extreme Networks (Nasdaq: EXTR) announced first-quarter fiscal 2001 earnings last night, clocking in with net income (excluding amortization costs) of $9 million, or $0.08 per share, ahead of analysts' estimates of $0.06 share, and double the year-ago figure of $4 million, or $0.04 per share. Sales were up 29% sequentially to $119.3 million, 153% higher than last year's third-quarter revenue of $47.2 million. Shares of the company fell initially in after-hours trading, but rebounded after the company increased its earnings forecasts for fiscal 2001 and 2002.  Communications chip designer Broadcom (Nasdaq: BRCM) joined the earnings parade after yesterday's market close. Sales for the company's third quarter more than doubled, to $319.6 million, while earnings (excluding acquisition and other costs) jumped to $78.7 million, or $0.30 per share, from last year's $28.7 million, or $0.12 per share. Consensus analysts' estimates were for the company to earn $0.24 per share. Broadcom designs chips for cable modems, digital set-top boxes, and other high-speed networking equipment.  Wireless communications software company Phone.com (Nasdaq: PHCM) also reported earnings last night, and the developer of the Wireless Application Protocol, or WAP, increased revenues 62% sequentially, to $46.5 million. The company's net loss, excluding amortization and other costs, was $10.4 million, or $0.13 per diluted share, ahead of consensus estimates for a $0.20 per share loss. Phone.com's new partner, Software.com (Nasdaq: SWCM), with which it expects to merge next month, also announced earnings. Sales reached $37.6 million, a 27% sequential increase, and earnings before acquisition and other costs were $7.4 million, or $0.13 per share, ahead of estimates of $0.03 per share.  And now for some non-earnings news: According to a Bloomberg report, telecom carrier WorldCom (Nasdaq: WCOM) is planning to create a tracking stock for its consumer long-distance business. The company indicated during its July earnings conference call that it was considering several options for its slow-growing voice operation, including a tracking stock. While WorldCom did not comment on yesterday's report, final word may come when the company releases earnings on October 26. Like other long-distance carriers, WorldCom is seeking to highlight the healthy growth of its data and Internet services by separating out the stagnant consumer long-distance unit, which grew revenues by only 1% last quarter.

Even a blind pig finds an acorn sometimes."" -- Bill Clinton, after shooting a golf round of 79, fulfilling a lifelong ambition to break 80   COMMERCE ONE REPORTS Q3 Internet B2B company Commerce One posted solid Q3 results after the market's close yesterday and now forecasts profitability by the second quarter of next fiscal year.  By Mike Trigg  Internet marketplace software provider Commerce One (Nasdaq: CMRC) reported impressive third-quarter results after the market's close yesterday, highlighted by new customer additions and the signing of several global mega-exchanges. The announcement came one day after business-to-business (B2B) juggernaut Ariba (Nasdaq: ARBA) declared its own results, becoming the first B2B company to report a breakeven quarter.  Commerce One's fiscal third quarter (ended September 30) net loss, excluding charges, was $14.7 million, or $0.09 per share, compared to $10.3 million, or $0.07 per share, in the same period one year ago. The Street consensus called for a loss of $0.12 per share. The positive results prompted management to revise its initial projection, now calling for profitability by next year's fiscal second quarter (ends June 30).  However, revenue figures tell the real story because B2B companies are still in a stage of hypergrowth. Commerce One's revenues increased from $62.7 million in the previous period to $112.7 million. That's 80% sequential growth. The revenue mix was 58% licenses (65% last quarter), with services accounting for the remaining 42% (35% last quarter). Nevertheless, as I mentioned earlier this week, deferred revenues and the amount of network revenues within service revenues were two important factors to track. Let's take a look at those quickly. http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=162547  Commerce One reported network revenues of $10.1 million, a sequential increase of $3 million. This number is important because it represents the amount of revenue sharing that occurred on active marketplaces and will substantially increase as more exchanges go live. Moreover, it currently represents mostly auction and subscription fees. However, as exchanges mature, it will include a greater amount of value-added and transaction-based revenue.  Deferred revenues took a jump from $62 million in the previous period to $95 million. Deferred revenues are a good liability because they represent cash that has been realized before at least a portion of the services have been completed. It's an important figure because it provides up-front investment capital and signifies management isn't overstating business. This quarter's increase can in part be attributed to the company's partnership with SAP (NYSE: SAP); however, management would not disclose to what amount.  The alliance with SAP continued to show major traction, despite being just 90 days old. Through the joint partnership, the company announced several mega-exchanges that include eHitex (high tech), Enporion (utility), Quadrem (mining and metals), and ForestExpress (paper and forest products). This gives the company 60% market share for top vertical exchanges. To hear Ariba CEO Keith Krach comment on the Commerce One and SAP alliance, check out Paul Commins' recent Rule Breaker column. http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=162548  Overall, the company posted a solid quarter and continued to execute, growing its total of 72 marketplaces to 107. Meanwhile, the number of live exchanges improved to 47, and the customer count improved by 96 to 316. The quarter was particularly impressive considering the acquisition of AppNet was only on the books for two weeks, and significant contributions will be made in the services portion of revenue upon a full quarter of contribution. _________________________________________________________________  NEWS TO GO  Fiber optic equipment maker Corvis Corp. (Nasdaq: CORV) announced better-than-expected fiscal third-quarter earnings after the market's close yesterday. The company reported a pro forma loss, excluding goodwill expense and equity-based pay, of $23.9 million, or $0.07 per share. The Street consensus called for a loss of $0.09 per share. Revenue came in at $22.9 million. However, the company still relies heavily on Broadwing (NYSE: BRW), which began commercial deployment of Corvis' suite of optical products in the quarter. Corvis closed at $59.60 per share in the regular session and jumped as high as $71 per share in after-hours trading.  Internet auction company eBay Inc. (Nasdaq: EBAY) announced its third-quarter earnings, exceeding Street expectations. The company said its earnings, excluding charges, were $19.1 million, or $0.07 per share, compared to $3 million, or $0.01 per share, in the year-ago period. The Street consensus estimate was $0.04 per share. Revenues improved year-over-year from $58.5 million to $113.4 million. In a conference call yesterday, eBay management stated the positive results were due to increased exposure in new geographic regions and additional product areas. Also, it cited a shift toward higher-margin products, such as cars.  Voice recognition software provider SpeechWorks (Nasdaq: SPWX) reported third-quarter earnings after the market's close yesterday, with revenues improving nearly threefold year-over-year and earnings that exceeded Street expectations. The Boston-based company reported a loss, excluding charges, of $5.4 million, or $0.20 per share, compared to a pro forma loss of $3.7 million, or $0.19 per share, in the same period last year. The Street consensus forecasted a loss of $0.23 per share. The company reported revenue of $8.6 million, a 237% year-over-year increase.  The world's largest maker of cellular phones, Ericsson (Nasdaq: ERICY), reported fiscal third-quarter earnings this morning and cut sales forecasts and profit figures for full-year 2000. The company attributed the revised outlook to losses in its mobile phone division and will now place a greater emphasis on wireless network equipment. The Swedish company is losing valuable market share to Finnish phone maker Nokia (NYSE: NOK), which yesterday predicted profitability in the fourth quarter. It also announced that it would move Swedish and U.S. phone production to Asia, Latin America, and Eastern Europe. Stay tuned for more on this story.

The correction curves are not published with the Test Reports.  The  calculations are given using the correction data only.  The curves and  detailed explanations are located in the purchase contracts.  2. The run hours are estimated based on the emissions limits, the guaranteed  emissions output of the equipment and average heat rates.      For example at Wheatland:   The NOx cap is 249 tons/year * 2000 = 498,000 lbs./yr.  (permit limits)  The NOx output of each unit is 0.092lbs /MMBtu  (Mfg. guarantee)  The Fuel Use is 1,486 MMBtu/hr HHV   (Based on avg. heat rate)  NOx /hr = 0.092 lbs/MMBtu * 1,486 MMBtu/hr   = 136.7 lbs/hr.    Plant NOx = 136.7 lbs/hr * 4       = 546.8 lbs/hr   Run Hours = 498,000 lbs/hr / 546.8 lbs/hr         = 911 hrs.  These numbers are approximate and are conservative.  3. Regarding the performance issue with Wheatland Unit#3;    I did find a  reference in the test report stating that units 3 & 4 were underfired due to  the MW limiter in the WDPF.  Unit 3 was loaded at only 96.2% of base load and  Unit 4 at 98.4%.  This along with Mitch's comments (The output guarantee was  for the facility and each unit could have been fine tuned differently) more  than likely contributed to the output differences.  4. The gas pressure issue at Wheatland in June was a one time excursion per  Chris Norris.  There have been no pressure problems since then.

Patterson   GENERAL ELECTRIC TO PURCHASE HONEYWELL General Electric announced plans to buy Honeywell for nearly $48.4 billion in stock and debt.  By Mike Trigg  Fairfield, Conn.-based General Electric (NYSE: GE) announced plans to purchase aerospace systems company Honeywell (NYSE: HON) for nearly $48.4 billion in stock and debt, GE's biggest deal ever. In addition, General Electric Chairman and CEO Jack Welch agreed to stay on through next year in order to see the acquisition through.  Under terms of the agreement, General Electric will pay 1.005 shares for the automated controls maker, or about $55.12 per share based on Honeywell's closing price Friday. The equity and debt mix is about $45 billion and $3.4 billion, respectively. According to General Electric, the deal will add at least $0.10 per share in its first full year and is being accounted for as a pooling of interest.  After planning to step down as chairman in April, it's a bonus Welch will be staying on to supervise the transition, calming Street concerns. He's been on the job for over two decades, overseeing tremendous company success, and is considered a top-notch corporate executive. The company still plans on going through with earlier plans to name a successor, expected sometime before the year's end. In European trading, General Electric was up, while Honeywell traded down.  The announcement comes only days after aerospace parts company United Technologies (NYSE: UTX) and Honeywell were in similar talks for a deal reportedly worth $40 billion. It would have created an aerospace parts company with over $48 billion in annual sales based on last fiscal year's figures. According to reports, United Technologies stepped away from the table, unwilling to engage in a bidding war after learning General Electric had entered the picture.  Likewise, this deal comes less than a year after AlligedSignal bought Honeywell and became Honeywell International. Of course, integration is always a concern with any acquisition, and this one will have its fair share of changes, with surely more to come. According to a Honeywell spokesperson, its headquarters in Morristown, N.J. will be closed and about 500 employees will potentially lose their jobs. Three Honeywell officials will be added to GE's board, including CEO Michael Bonsignore.  Overall, the acquisition creates an industrial Goliath that specializes in aerospace, chemicals, and plastics products and systems, among others. According to Welch, Honeywell's core businesses -- avionics, automated controls, performance materials, and microturbine technology -- are a perfect fit with four of General Electric's major business lines. _________________________________________________________________  NEWS TO GO  Optical networking company Corning (NYSE: GLW) announced fiscal third-quarter results this morning with profits more than doubling. The company cited increased demand for optical fiber and components used in communication networks. Corning reported pro forma earnings of $317 million, or $0.35 per share, compared to $148.1 million, or $0.17 per share, in the year-ago period. The announcement was in line with the company's recently raised forecast of $0.34 to $0.35 per share, with the Street consensus calling for $0.34 per share. Revenues came in at $1.9 billion, a 54% increase from the year-ago figure of $1.25 billion.  Over the weekend, Lucent Technologies' (NYSE: LU) board of directors named Henry Schacht the company's new chairman and CEO. According to a press release, a need for a new set of skills at this point in the company's life was the reason for replacing existing Chairman and CEO Richard McGinn. Schacht is returning to a position he held from 1995 to 1997. He will work with senior management to run day-to-day operations and will begin a search for his successor. The change could not come at a better time, as Bill man recently commented. After yet another earnings warning earlier this month, Lucent shareholders were calling for the McGinn's removal. Hooray for them, I suppose. http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=164345  According to The Wall Street Journal, AT&T (NYSE: T) is contemplating a plan, ""Project Grand Slam"", that would split the company into four businesses: consumer long distance, wireless, business, and broadband. The Business Services division, its largest and most profitable, would become the new AT&T. It would create brand and licensing arrangements with the three other businesses. That division generated 39% of the company's total 1999 revenue, or $25 billion. The proposal will be discussed at the telecommunication provider's board meeting Monday and, if approved, could be announced as soon as Wednesday.

"Ben:    Here are my answers to the Allegheny Questions below.  Please confirm the  details with Dave Kellermeyer where necessary.  Question 1:   Does the Lincoln facility have an air operating permit from the  Illinois Environmental Protection Agency?  If so, please provide a copy. If  not,    please explain status.  Answer:  I believe that the application for the Title V Operating Permit for  the Lincoln Energy Center was submitted to the IEPA in the Spring of 2000.   Dave   Kellermeyer can definitively answer whether this Operating Permit has  been issued/received from the IEPA.  Question 2: Were any wetlands impacted by the construction of the facility  and, if so, what permits were obtained?  Will any wetlands be impacted by  future   expansion plans?  ENSR's conclusion on this issue seemed unclear,  particularly with respect to the 30 acre parcel.  See 02.03.09C.  Answer:  The ENSR Wetlands Delineation activities conducted during the period  of December 1998 through February 1999 determined the following:    1.  No wetlands existed on the 50 acre parcel upon which the Lincoln  Energy Center was ultimately constructed.    2.  An agricultural wetland area existed within the parcel of land  adjacent to the western boundary of the Lincoln Energy Center 50 acre     parcel.    3.  After reviewing the ENSR wetland delineation information, the Will  County NRCS confirmed the existence and boundary location of the     agricultural wetland and  concurred with the ENSR conclusion that the  agricultural wetland boundary was completely contained within the    parcel  of land adjacent to the western boundary of the Lincoln Energy Center 50 acre  parcel.  With regard to wetlands impacted during construction of the Facility, the  construction of the Facility's natural gas pipeline lateral was routed  through several existing wetland areas.  The potential impact of this  lateral's construction on existing wetlands was mitigated through a  directional drilling program implemented during the pipeline construction  activity.  The Site Development permits required for this pipeline  construction activity were obtained from the Will County Land Use  Department.    With regard to future Facility expansion plans, no impact to wetlands is  expected provided that such expansion occurs within the existing boundaries  of the 50 acre Facility parcel.  As a note to Question 2 above, I could not locate a reference to a 30 acre  parcel within the ENSR Wetland Investigation Report described as 02.03.09C.   Perhaps this is a typo and should be 50 acres.  Call/see me to discuss this information.  I will be in the office tomorrow  (10/24) until 2 pm and then in Chicago on Wed-Thursday.  I will access my  email via laptop while I am out of the office.  Fred      Benjamin Rogers 10/23/2000 03:22 PM To: Fred Mitro/HOU/ECT@ECT cc:   Subject:   More Questions.  Thanks!

Game on!  By Rick Aristotle Munarriz  The game's afoot for software specialist Activision (Nasdaq: ATVI). The popular video game maker trounced analyst estimates like a Quake baddie in one of its console ports. http://www.lnksrv.com/m.asp?i=165621  Earnings more than quadrupled to $0.17 a share, a stunning eight cents above Wall Street projections. Revenues climbed by 25% to $144.4 million with the peak holiday shopping season right around the corner.  But, as we noted last week, delays in mass shipments of the highly anticipated PlayStation 2 might hose down some of that red-hot momentum with the video game powerhouses. Without enough systems to meet seasonal demand, and few gamers willing to stockpile games for platforms on the way out, how will Activision perform? http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=165622  The company is now hiking its annual bottom-line forecast by seven cents to $0.63 a share. The only problem is that the company used up eight of those upwardly revised coppers this past quarter. That means that the game maker is looking to fall a penny short in either the December or March reporting period.  That might happen later rather than sooner. Since mid-September the company's Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2 has been the top-selling title for the top-selling PlayStation system. While we are now just two days away from the PlayStation 2 launch, the extreme skating title should continue to roll along nicely in the near term.  Activision -- the subject of StockTalk last April -- is the country's second-largest developer of game console software, behind only Electronic Arts (Nasdaq: ERTS). The company is looking for flat growth over the year ahead but a 50% spike come calendar year 2002. http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=165623  So the past looks great. The long-term appears equally aglow. It's the near-term that might have investors fumbling for the pause button. _________________________________________________________________  NEWS TO GO  Winning the battle but Lucent (NYSE: LU) the war, the telecommunications titan reported earnings of $0.18 a share, a penny above estimates. The problem? Analysts were looking for a $0.29 showing before the company gave Wall Street downward guidance due to soft equipment sales. That prompted the bar being lowered to a height of $0.17 a share. Over the weekend, the company's board of directors fired its CEO. Reserve the right to do the same to anyone who naively tells you that Lucent is back on track because it topped fourth-quarter projections. http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=165624 http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=165625  Twenty-five million Welcomes. This morning America Online (NYSE: AOL) announced that it reached the 25 million subscriber mark for its namesake online service. It was simply a matter of time -- and of scatter software marketing -- since the company had announced that it had 24.6 million users at the end of the September quarter. On the merger front, today's Wall Street Journal is reporting that the review deadline for its Time Warner (NYSE: TWX) acquisition has been extended by two weeks. The stateside antitrust authorities continue to ponder the ramifications of the mega media merger.  National Semiconductor (NYSE: NSM) is laying its chips on the table and the stock is falling as it may. The company has warned that its second and third quarters might fall short of its fiscal first-quarter showing. The company earned $0.76 a share on $640 million in revenues for the period.  It was another ""pfine"" quarter for Pfizer (NYSE: PFE). The pharmaceuticals powerhouse reported earnings of $0.27 a share on revenues of $7.2 billion. The results came in two cents ahead of expectations. For the year, the company is comfortable with targets of $30 billion in revenue and $1.01 a share in earnings.

By LouAnn Lofton  Nortel Networks (NYSE: NT) announced third-quarter results yesterday after the market's closing bell. The company met earnings expectations, but perceived top-line growth weakness sent shares of the Canadian telecommunications company plummeting as much as 20% in after-hours trading.  Nortel's income from operations, which excludes certain acquisition costs, was $574 million, or $0.18 a share. In last year's third quarter, the company's operating income was $314 million, and earnings per share (EPS) was $0.11. Analysts as polled by First Call/Thompson Financial were looking for $0.17 a share.  Revenues for Nortel increased 42% over last year's $5.15 billion to $7.31 billion. Many analysts, though, were looking for Nortel's revenues to come in between $7.5 and $7.63 billion. It was this ""shortfall"" that sent Nortel's shares down in after-hours trading.  Nortel saw its strongest growth from its optical networking business, where revenues grew by 90% compared to last year. Its wireless Internet solutions business also did very well, with revenues up 50% in this quarter versus the year-ago quarter.  The company reiterated that it sees its revenue growth for 2000 in the low-40% range. It raised its target for EPS from operations growth to the same range as revenue growth, up from the previously expected high-30% level.  John Roth, Nortel's president and chief executive officer, said, ""We are extremely pleased with the strong growth in the quarter, which reflected our continued strength and leadership in the key growth areas of Optical Internet, Wireless Internet, Local Internet and eBusiness Solutions. Carriers and service providers around the world continued the drive to provide a broad range of wireless, internet and eBusiness services to their customers."" _________________________________________________________________  AFTER-HOURS COVERAGE  AMAZON'S SOLID THIRD QUARTER By LouAnn Lofton E-commerce company Amazon.com reported its third-quarter results today after the bell. Its pro forma net loss widened, but the company's revenues and loss per share came in ahead of expectations. Other positives included a growing gross margin, key expenses shrinking, and an expanding customer base. The company also used less cash in its operations for the quarter than it did last year. This hurdle behind it, all eyes now turn to the all-important holiday shopping season. FULL STORY>> http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=167606  SIEBEL KEEPS ROCKIN' By Mike Trigg CRM juggernaut Siebel Systems announced great earnings tonight. The results were a reflection of the company's dominance in the fast-paced software space. Again, it showed excellent traction in the middle-market and abroad, which will be major growth drivers down the road. FULL STORY>> http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=167607  EXCITE@HOME'S THIRD QUARTER By Nico Detourn The company added a record number of subscribers during the quarter, which added plausibility to its ambitious year-end sub target. But finding a new CEO, and its relationship with AT&T, may have more influence on near-term perception of the company than will the details its operational performance. FULL STORY>> http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=167608 _________________________________________________________________  NEWS TO GO  Compaq Computer (NYSE: CPQ) reported third-quarter results yesterday after the market's close. The computer maker said that net income for the quarter, including an investment gain, was $550 million, or $0.31 a share. Minus the gain, Compaq earned $0.30 a share, which was ahead of analysts' expectations by a penny. Sales grew 22% to $11.2 billion. Michael Capellas, Compaq's chief executive officer, said, ""Our revenue was the highest in Compaq's history."" In a conference call, Compaq CFO Jesse Greene said that the weak euro will negatively impact Compaq's fourth-quarter results by up to $100 million in pre-tax profits. Compaq now expects earnings per share in the fourth quarter to be about $0.37, below the current estimate of $0.41.  Chip maker LSI Logic (NYSE: LSI) announced third-quarter earnings yesterday. Net income, excluding special items, more than doubled to $114 million, from $55 million last year. On a per-share basis, LSI Logic earned $0.33, compared to $0.17 in the year-ago period. The consensus estimate according to First Call/Thompson Financial for LSI Logic's third period was $0.32. Revenues at the company increased 35% to $728 million. Wilfred Corrigan, LSI's chief executive officer, said the company is comfortable with fourth-quarter estimates of $0.36 a share.  Long-distance telephone company AT&T (NYSE: T) reported third-quarter results this morning. Earnings, excluding onetime items, fell 12% to $1.44 billion, or $0.38 a share, from $1.63 billion, or $0.50 a share, last year. Analysts were expecting $0.36 a share. AT&T's sales rose 4% to $16.98 billion. Strong wireless and data sales were overshadowed by AT&T's declining sales of its long-distance services to residential customers. Sales to consumers fell 11%, while corporate sales increased 2.5%. AT&T also announced that, as rumored, it will break up into four smaller companies. The restructuring is expected to be done in 2002.  Entertainment and media company Viacom (NYSE: VIA) announced third-quarter earnings this morning. Viacom's net income was $33 million, down from last year's $97 million. On a per-share basis, Viacom earned $0.02, compared to $0.14 in the year-ago period. Analysts had expected Viacom to lose $0.02 a share. Sales at the company grew 79% to $6 billion from $3.3 billion last year. Higher taxes and costs associated with the company's purchase of CBS affected results, though Viacom did see strong advertising revenue growth.

"Sections:   2.11 last question: Yes plant can operate without a gas nomination in place  for that day. As mentioned      a gas nomination and a notice of flow to Gas Control are both requested  by Midwestern      but not required.   2.12   Interruptible transport maximum under current contract is 125,000/day.      First 85,000/day is at discounted rate.      Physical capacity of interconnect is 190,000/day.   2.15   As mentioned above the maximum physical capacity of the interconnect  between the plant and      Midwestern is 190,000 mmbtu/day or about 7900/hour.  Our current  transportation contract       maximum is 125,000/day (first 85,000/day discounted) because with  current plant size the      maximum hourly flow rate is 5500/hour.  Additional Interruptible  transport from Pipeline      could easily be granted.    2.16   All daily imbalances hit the OBA (Operational Balancing Agreement) at  the plant site.  There is      no charge for the OBA, or for the daily imbalances.  Imbalances are  cumulative for the month      and are cashed-out at each month end in accordance to Midwestern tariff  provisions.       Per Midwestern, holder of OBA is asked to minimize  size of imbalance  in accordance       to integrity off Midwestern's system.  If a daily imbalance, or   cumulative imbalance      begins to threaten integrity of system, Midwestern can call and ask you  to reduce imbalance.      After that warning the pipe can issue a point specific OFO, which could  lead to penalties      for failure to minimize any imbalances.       Since inception of plant 5/00 -  we have never encountered any balancing  problems/penalties.

"Ben,  I spoke to Ross Newlin regarding the vibration problems.  The Westinghouse  engineers corrected the problem to the point that it was below alarm limits.   There is no plan to repair the problem during the November outage since it  requires significant run time and the economics are not there for a November  run.  However, West. has committed to come back to the plant in January when  we can schedule some run time.  Ross will try to track down the minutes of  the outage planning meeting to document this.  I'll forward them to you when  I get them.

Just $2.99 per order.  http://www.lnksrv.com/m.asp?i=3D168091   ASK THE FOOL  -- Q. What's a mock portfolio?  -- A. Mock portfolios are a great tool for people new to investing and for those trying out new investing methods. You simply go through all the motions of investing, stopping short of actually plunking down your hard-earned cash. Research some companies, decide which ones you'd buy, and then set up a pretend portfolio, either on paper or online. (Many websites offer online portfolio tracking -- and we're one of them.) Keep track of details such as when you ""bought"" the shares and at what price. Then track your performance, aiming to beat the market. http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=3D168092  -- Q. I've heard you sing the praises of the Standard & Poor's (S&P) 500 index fund on your radio show, but I'm wondering what other indexes are out there.  -- A. A bunch of indexes exist, with each one representing a particular group of companies. We'll highlight just a few. The most famous one is the Dow Jones Industrial Index, which includes 30 flagship American giants, such as Exxon, Wal-Mart, Merck, Coca-Cola and Microsoft. The S&P 500 also focuses on large companies, including 500 of America's biggest and best.  The Russell 3000 Index includes 3,000 of the largest U.S. companies based on market capitalization (current share price multiplied by number of shares outstanding). These 3,000 constitute about 98 percent of the U.S. market. For a measure of small-cap companies, look to the Russell 2000. It's composed of the 2,000 smallest companies in the Russell 3000. The Wilshire 5000 is just about the broadest index of American companies. It began with 5,000 but now contains more than 7,000.  There are many more indexes. Some are for international regions such as Latin America or the Far East. Others address sectors such as utilities, semiconductors, the Internet and fried chicken. (Just kidding about the chicken.)

The first winner of the Jester was Guy Kawasaki's new book, ""Rules for Revolutionaries"" (HarperBusiness, $15). In it, he lays out some bold guidelines for those who want to bring about business revolutions. Here are a few: http://www.lnksrv.com/m.asp?i=3D168095  1. ""Don't worry, be crappy."" Yes, you read that right. It's Kawasaki's inimitable way of reminding us that it can take almost forever to perfect something, and that it's often best to release a not-quite-perfect product and then work on improving its next generation. He illustrates this with the 1984 Macintosh computer, which was shipped in a less-than-perfect configuration: only 128K of RAM, no hard drive, no documentation, and so on. Waiting to perfect the product would have meant giving the competition an edge and losing the confidence of software developers.  2. ""Eat your own dog food."" This sounds crazy, but think about it. By using your own company's products or services, you'll understand what the customer experience is like and you'll be able to flag problems quickly. Forrest Mars Sr., the man who built Mars Inc., did taste his own company's dog food (literally), a practice that continues today at the company. Kawasaki offers the example of Gillette, which maintains a shaving laboratory where 300 employees per day come in unshaven and test the company's and competitors' products. Similarly, bicycle manufacturer Cannondale encourages its employees to commute by Cannondale bikes, so that they can offer feedback on products.  3. ""Eat like a bird, poop like an elephant."" (Really, we're not making this stuff up!) Birds actually eat a lot -- sometimes 50 percent of their weight every day. And elephants can poop 165 pounds per day. The idea here is that you should soak up as much information as you can find and then share it.  If you're looking for a well-written, engaging book to help you stay on the cutting edge of the best thinking and writing on personal finance and investing, keep an eye out for Jester Award winners.

By Chris Rugaber  Internet content aggregator InfoSpace (Nasdaq: INSP) reported third-quarter financial results after yesterday's market close. The company almost tripled revenues, and posted operating profits of $9.47 million, or $0.03 per share, up from $2.97 million, or $0.01 per share, in last year's third quarter. Analysts expected the company to break even, before acquisition and amortization costs. Including those expenses, InfoSpace lost $48.7 million, or $0.17 per share.  Revenues jumped to $57.7 million, from $19.9 million in the year-earlier period, thanks in part to increasing sales to wireless service providers, such as Verizon (NYSE: VZ), Alltel (NYSE: AT), and Cingular Wireless, the partnership between SBC Communications (NYSE: SBC) and BellSouth (NYSE: BLS). InfoSpace enables wireless carriers to provide content and services such as news, maps, and email for their wireless Web offerings. The company reported that it counts 20 wireless carriers worldwide as its customers. http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=169495  InfoSpace also provides broadband and wireline Internet services, and the company recently expanded its reach with its purchase of website operator Go2Net, which closed during the quarter. ""InfoSpace is better positioned than ever to leverage four parallel areas with massive promise: wireless, merchant, broadband, and wireline consumer services,"" said CEO Arun Sarin in a prepared statement. http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=169496  After skyrocketing last winter, the company's stock fell almost as swiftly, declining 62% so far this year. Nevertheless, shares rose in overnight trading as high as $24.50, from yesterday's close at $20.31. _________________________________________________________________  NEWS TO GO  Just as PlayStation 2 units go on sale in the U.S., Sony Corp. (NYSE: SNE) reported a 57% drop in profits for its fiscal second quarter. Net income was down to 19.8 billion yen ($183 million), from 46.5 billion yen ($430 million) in the year-earlier period. Analysts' estimates were for 26.6 billion yen in profit. Revenue rose only 3.7% to 1.69 trillion yen. Sales of the company's electronic products were strong, and accounted for 80% of sales in the quarter, but were offset by a 17% drop in revenue from game operations and an 18% drop in sales from the music division.  Electronic manufacturing services company SCI Systems (NYSE: SCI) announced a 22% increase in sales and a 24% jump in earnings yesterday for its first quarter 2001 (ended September 24). Net income reached $50.5 million, or $0.34 per share, compared to $0.28 in the year-ago period. ""Continued telecommunication product diversification and a lower sales concentration in PC finished products led to higher operating margins in the quarter,"" CEO Gene Sapp noted in a prepared statement.  Biotech company Chiron Corp. (Nasdaq: CHIR) reported a 30% jump in third-quarter profits after yesterday's market close. Net income reached $43.1 million, or $0.23 per share, up from $33 million, or $0.17 per share, in the year-earlier period, and ahead of analysts' estimates of $0.17 per share. Sales of the company's vaccines rose 11% to $78 million, while the company's lead drug, Proleukin, brought in $21 million in revenue, compared to $19 million in last year's third quarter. Some analysts expected sales of Proleukin to reach $30 million. The company's shares dropped about $2, or 4%, in after-hours trading.  Internet security and name-registration company VeriSign (Nasdaq: VRSN) blew away third-quarter estimates, reporting an operating profit last night (excluding acquisition costs) of $38.4 million, or $0.18 per share, significantly higher than the $0.06 per share analysts expected.

Will they be enough to reverse this week's mass sell-off in the sector?   By Dave Marino-Nachison  An upbeat fiscal first-quarter earnings report from fiber optic components leader JDS Uniphase (Nasdaq: JSDU) following last night's bell perked up investors in after-hours trading, pumping the stock 12%, after a 25% plummet on Wednesday. JDSU and other fiber optics companies, such as Sycamore Networks (Nasdaq: SCMR) and Ciena (Nasdaq: CIEN), have been capsized by the wake of Nortel's (NYSE: NT) earnings report from earlier in the week. (Nortel is a major customer of JDSU.)  Nortel's optical networking division didn't grow as quickly as some analysts hoped, which compounded another recent disappointment from Lucent (NYSE: LU). But Rule Maker JDSU's results sparkled: Revenues rose 171% year-over-year and, at $785 million, overcame the projections of market watchers. Pro forma net income rose 29% to $0.18 per share, beating Street forecasts by two pennies. http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=171083 http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=171084  Now JDSU expects to earn $0.80 per share -- a dime better than expected -- for the fiscal year, CFO Tony Muller reportedly said on a conference call. He also pointed investors toward top-line growth of between 115% and 120%. ""Optical demand is good and healthy,"" a Robertson Stephens analyst told Bloomberg.  ""We believe demand remains strong,'' COO Charles Abbe was quoted as saying. He maintains the company isn't seeing the inventory channel grow fat at the expense of future sales: ""We can't find any meaningful evidence of an industry slowdown.'' Look for Q2 pro forma earnings of $0.19 or $0.20 per share, execs said, compared with $0.17 as projected by Wall Street.  While short-term market movements are of little interest to Fools, today's trading should prove interesting as investors work to make sense of the recent rash of seemingly conflicting indications. While some might say the fiber optic sector was merely due for a ""correction"" of sorts, of greater importance are clues about the sort of demand that lies ahead to justify or confound even today's damaged -- but still extremely high -- valuations.  Demand for the components that speed data transmissions and fatten networks to meet skyrocketing bandwidth needs isn't expected to slow significantly for the next several years. For more information, check out a column Richard McCaffery wrote back in July. http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=171085 _________________________________________________________________  NEWS TO GO  Kellogg (NYSE: K) agreed to buy Keebler Foods (NYSE: KBL) for $3.86 billion, or $42 a share, a 4.4% premium over Keebler's $40.44 close yesterday. Kellogg will triple its debt load to swallow Keebler, but buying the No. 2 cookie and cracker maker helps it diversify its core breakfast cereals business, which has seen no growth for a decade. Keebler and No. 1 snack maker Nabisco Holdings Corp. (NYSE: NA) compete in a market growing at 4% a year. Philip Morris (NYSE: MO) will join its Kraft division with its planned purchase of Nabisco Holdings, not to be confused with Nabisco Group Holdings (NYSE: NGH), to be purchased by R.J. Reynolds (NYSE: RJR).  Leading biopharmaceutical company Amgen (Nasdaq: AMGN) reported a pro forma 12% increase in revenues and an 18% increase in earnings for the quarter ending September 30. However, the company forecasted slower sales for its two main revenue producers, Epogen and Neupogen, and said that approval of its Kineret rheumatoid arthritis treatment could be delayed until the second half of next year. Amgen's shares dropped to $59.50 in after-market trading, from $68.50 at the day's close.  Big-shot hedge fund manager Jeffrey Vinik announced that he was returning most of the $4.2 billion in assets of Vinik Asset Management so he can spend more time with his family. Most investors remember Vinik, 41, as the manager appointed to replace legendary Peter Lynch at Fidelity's Magellan Fund. Vinik Asset Management reportedly turned in a four-year 645% return to investors, 440% after fees.  Beleaguered Belgian voice recognition software maker Lernout & Hauspie Speech Products (Nasdaq: LHSP) announced it would resolve confidentiality agreements and release to Securities and Exchange Commission and European Easdaq exchange investigators the names of 30 investors in closely held companies that Lernout says are customers. These Belgian and Singaporean companies figure prominently into accusations of impropriety concerning Lernout's Asian divisions' revenues. The Wall Street Journal has run several stories hitting the company hard for alleged questionable accounting, but the company has maintained that its practices are legal and common in Europe, but misunderstood by Americans. The disclosure news sank the stock price another 35%. _________________________________________________________________  EDITORS' PICK  Jeff Fischer redefines retirement as ""financial independence"" and talks about reaching this desirable time in life -- maybe sooner than you think! http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=171086 _______________________________________________________________  -News & Commentary  http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=171087  -Fool Community  http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=171088  -Post of the Day  http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=171089  -Latest Fribble  http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=171090  -Latest Market Numbers  http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=171091 ____________________________________________________________  My Portfolio: http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=171092 My Discussion Boards: http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=171093 My Fool: http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=171094 Fool.com Home: http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=171095 My E-Mail Settings: http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=171096    Sponsored By: BUYandHOLD  Hey Fool!

I am not sure whether you would prefer to  package them with your follow up items or send them independently.  Bracketed  items require attention.   1)  Both the Remote Control Operation Agreement and the Interconnection  Agreement with IPL were filed with the FERC.  [File stamped copies were sent  to Hoff (and you) and should be incorporated into DealBench.];  2)  Regarding the question concerning document number 02.03.13 (Indiana  Utility Regulatory Commission (""IURC"") Petition and Approval) - According to  our local counsel (Parvin Price at Bose McKinney), no approval or other  authorization from the IURC is required in connection with a change in  ownership.  If our transaction was structured as a disposition of assets,  however, IURC consent would be required.  [He also mentioned that: (i) the  new buyer should contact the IURC (if they were ""smart"") to notify them of  the change in control following closing (this may have been his pitch for  further business) and (ii) pursuant to the IURC Order dated 8/99 West Fork  has certain on-going reporting requirements (he wondered whether we had  delivered these reports - this is probably a Gus or Dave question).];  3)  Regarding any obligation or covenant of West Fork under the PILOT  Agreement, I have exchanged voicemails with John Gregg (our local counsel in  Indiana).  He briefly indicated that there is some ""local expectation.""  But  said that he wanted to check into it further.  [I will provide an update  Monday.]; and  4)  A question was raised with respect to the use of the easement from  Carnanhan to West Fork dated 11/30/99  (Recorded in DR 271, P 688).  [Keenan  will need to provide an answer on this one.]  I sent him an email requesting  a response on this one.  These were the only outstanding DPL items that were on my list.  I would  expect that Keenan, Kellermeyer and Eghneim will be able to provide answers  to questions 4 and 2, respectively, no later than noon on Monday.  I will  endeavour to meet the same time schedule on question 3.  Please feel free to  call with any questions.

By Tom Jacobs  Patience is a virtue -- especially for foreign businesses in China. According to Reuters, Shell Chemicals topped off 12 years of negotiations with China National Offshore Oil Corp. by signing a $4.05 billion petrochemical contract over the weekend. The Chinese Xinhua news agency heralded the deal as the largest joint venture yet between China and a foreign partner. Shell is majority-owned by Netherlands-based energy powerhouse Royal Dutch Petroleum (NYSE: RD), now facing increased worldwide competition from the proposed merger between Chevron (NYSE: CHV) and Texaco (NYSE: TX). http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=172918  The companies will build a petrochemical complex in the southern city of Huizhou, Guangdong province, which will at first produce ethylene and petrochemical products. Reuters reports Xinhua's assertion that the new project brings technology for China to make low-end chemical products. The $4.05 billion involves only the Huizhou complex, for which construction will begin in 2003. More cash will be pumped into a subsequent phase involving oil refineries, according to Xinhua.  The deal supports one view that foreign business deals with China and many Asian nations require years of relationship development. Shell already operates more than 20 oil and chemical projects in China, but even after talks extended from 1988 to an agreed-upon framework in 1997, it took until this weekend to ink the final details.  Xinhua reports $330 billion in foreign direct investment in China since economic liberalization began in the 1970s. Front-page placement on the People's Daily showcases China's current commitment to foreign deals. Others this year include Motorola's (NYSE: MOT) $1.9 billion chip-making complex contract, announced in August, and the on-again, off-again CDMA phone deal with Qualcomm (Nasdaq: QCOM). _________________________________________________________________  NEWS TO GO  Publishers Reed Elsevier (47% owned by Elsevier (NYSE: ENL)) and Thomson Corp. announced a $4.45 billion cash purchase of rival educational publisher Harcourt General (NYSE: H) on Friday. Reed plans to keep Harcourt's medical, scientific, and technical businesses. It will also retain the elementary and secondary school textbook operations, but sell Harcourt's higher-education and professional businesses to Thomson for $2.06 billion. Harcourt closed Friday up 9.05% to $56.81. http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=172919  The Wall Street Journal reports that Microsoft (Nasdaq: MSFT) and News Corp. (NYSE: NWS) are in talks over a possible Microsoft $1 billion investment in Sky Global, News Corp.'s global satellite TV asset and investment arm. News Corp. had hoped to spin off Sky Global this year, but the move has been reportedly postponed until next year due to the softening market for public offerings.  DaimlerChrysler (NYSE: DCX) said it would shut down seven North American manufacturing plants for a week -- four in the U.S. and three in Canada. Spokesman Juergen Wittman told Reuters: ""We want to catch up with demand. We need to balance our inventory."" Wittman also said the action has nothing do with earnings or Friday's 1.4 million unit Dodge, Chrysler, and Plymouth minivan recall due to seal leaks.  The Wall Street Journal reports that Loral Space & Communications (NYSE: LOR) CEO Bernard Schwartz is in talks with Societe Europeene des Satellites about injecting cash or partnering with the weakened company. Loral has been hit by stumbles of its 40%-owned low-earth orbit satellite venture, Globalstar (Nasdaq: GSTRF) -- whose satellite communications system has seen a slower subscriber ramp -- and the hangover from the failed Iridium satellite telephony venture. The Journal reported that Schwartz promises not to put more cash into Globalstar unless it makes sense compared to other stand-alone investments. Loral has already pumped in $1 billion of the $4.3 billion Globalstar cash diet, and is slated to assume $500 million in debt by the end of the year. Loral's share price closed Friday at $5.19 -- less than Globalstar's finish at $6.

Is the flight plan due north?  By Rick Aristotle Munarriz  Online travel specialist Expedia (Nasdaq: EXPE) has been cleared for takeoff this morning after stellar fiscal first-quarter results. Revenues soared 115% to $76.5 million on $467 million in gross travel bookings.  Even more impressive was the fact that the company generated positive operating cash flow. That may not last in the near term as the company expects to ramp up marketing efforts that will bulk up operating expenses. However, Expedia is still on track to be profitable on an earnings basis by the summer of 2002.  The quarterly loss absent noncash charges was just $1.6 million, or $0.04 a share. That was substantially better than projections, which were calling for a deficit between $0.25 and $0.27 a share.  The analyst-besting results continue the e-travel trend set by Travelocity.com (Nasdaq: TVLY) two weeks ago. But probably the most encouraging metric for the online travel industry as a whole -- a gauge that seems to be buried deep in the data -- is the rising conversion rate, or what Travelocity calls the ""lookers-to-bookers"" ratio.  On a sequential basis, Expedia's conversion rate climbed from 4.1% to 4.6%. Over the past year, Travelocity users have gone from a 3.8% conversion ratio to a stunning 6.8%.  Why is this so important? It vindicates the industry. While jaded cybersurfers seem less willing to click on banner ads or fall for spam, they have clearly embraced the notion of booking travel online in growing numbers. Since e-travel is fully scalable and information-intensive (not inventory warehouse-based) the incremental growth is the best way to assure a smooth flight to eventual profitability.  Expedia closed out the quarter with $122.3 million in cash. Half of that came from recent financing that included the deep pockets of Microsoft (Nasdaq: MSFT), which still owns 70% of the company after a November 1999 spin-off. The greenbacks? Well, that just makes for a bigger seat cushion for the company as it glides past the next few quarters. And you know what they say about airline seat cushions, don't you? In case of emergency, they can be used as a flotation device. _________________________________________________________________  NEWS TO GO  Santa Claus isn't the only one decked out in red this time of year. Leading playthings online retailer eToys (Nasdaq: ETYS) reported wider losses for the September quarter. However, the company expects the deficit to narrow for the critical December period with improving results next year en route to breaking even come 2002. Like Amazon.com (Nasdaq: AMZN) last week, eToys will be mailing out a print catalog this season to lure holiday shoppers online.  All's well that's Alcatel (NYSE: ALA). Europe's second-leading telecommunications equipment maker bucked the trend set earlier by companies such as Lucent (NYSE: LU) and Nortel (NYSE: NT) and reported stronger-than-projected results. Profits more than tripled as the French company upgraded its sales outlook for the year.  Are HMO stocks feeling better? Quarterly profits rose at Humana (NYSE: HUM) while analysts expected bottom-line results to be in line with last year's showing. The company credits its tighter cost controls and the flexibility to raise premiums as the catalysts for the healthy showing.  HEALTHSOUTH (NYSE: HRC) also came in for its quarterly checkup and reported record revenues and profits of $0.18 a share -- in line with analyst expectations. Like Humana, HEALTHSOUTH was also encouraged by favorable pricing trends. Hey! That means we're paying more for HMO service, doesn't it? I thought so.

By LouAnn Lofton  In an effort to boost its sagging stock price, and unlock greater opportunities for the parts of its business that are growing the quickest, telecommunications company WorldCom (Nasdaq: WCOM) announced restructuring plans this morning. The company, which has seen its stock tumble from a 52-week high in November 1999 of $61.33 to its current price of around $23, will create a tracking stock for its MCI business. The ticker for the new stock will be MCIT.  WorldCom shareholders will receive one share of MCI for every 25 shares of WorldCom they own. The distribution of MCI stock is expected to happen by the end of the first half of 2001.  Tracked under the new MCIT ticker will be WorldCom's slowest-growing divisions. The bulk of the operations that will be reflected with the tracking stock are WorldCom's long-distance and dial-up Internet services for consumers and small businesses. These parts of WorldCom's business generate about $16 billion in annual revenues.  The split leaves WorldCom with the best-performing and highest-growth businesses. That includes its Internet and data businesses, its international business, and its wireless business. These divisions of WorldCom contribute annual revenues of around $23 billion, with $16 billion coming from the company's data, Internet, and international operations.  WorldCom also issued earnings guidance this morning. The company said it sees fourth-quarter earnings per share coming in between $0.34 and $0.37. Analysts as polled by First Call/Thompson Financial were looking for $0.49 a share. The company pointed to ""intense pricing pressures, unfavorable foreign exchange rates and the shift of consumer voice to wireless technologies"" as the reasons for the shortfall. It also lowered expectations for its next fiscal year.  WorldCom's decision to split its businesses comes not long after a similar move from competitor AT&T (NYSE: T), which announced last week that it will split itself into four parts. http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=177644 _________________________________________________________________  NEWS TO GO  Health insurance company Aetna (NYSE: AET) announced third-quarter earnings this morning. Operating earnings, excluding onetime items, dropped to $158.1 million from $184.1 million last year. On a per-share basis, that translates into $1.10 a share, versus $1.21 a year ago. Analysts were expecting $0.90 a share. Revenues climbed 15% to $8.1 billion. In last year's third quarter, Aetna's revenues were $7.1 billion.  Airborne Freight (NYSE: ABF) reported a third-quarter loss last night that was greater than had been expected. The company lost $5.5 million in the quarter, or $0.11 a share. It warned analysts in September to look for a loss of between $0.05 and $0.10 a share. Previously, analysts had expected a profit of $0.28 a share. After the September warning, the consensus estimate fell to a loss of $0.07 a share. Airborne Freight blamed high fuel costs and softness in its core domestic business for the shortfall. In last year's third quarter, Airborne Freight earned $21.6 million, or $0.44 a share.  Broadband company Covered Communications (Nasdaq: COVD) acknowledged today that CEO Robert Knowling will resign. This comes just two weeks after Covad reported a wider-than-expected loss for the third quarter. The company's stock has been pounded this year, falling from a high of $66.63 to around $5 a share. Frank Marshall, one of Covad's directors, has been named interim CEO. Former chief and founder Charles McMinn will assume the role of chairman.  Computer Sciences (NYSE: CSC), the information technology services company, announced that it's inked a $2.2 billion agreement with British defense contractor BAE Systems. The agreement is for six years and replaces a current agreement between the two which expires in March 2004. Under the deal, Computer Sciences will manage BAE's IT infrastructure in the United Kingdom and here in the states.

I'm interested in REITs (Real Estate Investment Trusts), but I don't understand what ""FFO"" refers to. Can you explain?  -- A. REITs look and act much like ordinary stocks, but peek under their hoods and you'll see a different kind of company. REITs typically own many properties, such as offices, hotels or apartments. With most companies, net income is a useful number to evaluate, reflecting the profits left over from sales after all expenses have been subtracted. With REITs, though, net income isn't as meaningful.  According to accounting rules, the value of REIT properties is decreased over time, with depreciation charged against net income, reducing it. In reality, however, these properties are probably not falling in value and may even be appreciating. So a REIT's net income tends to understate its health. This is why, with REITs, you should look at the ""funds from operation,"" or FFO, instead. They ignore the effect of depreciation and other non-cash charges to help you see a REIT's true performance.  -- Q. I often see S&P futures referred to on CNBC. Can you explain what futures are and why they're important?  -- A. Futures are typically for commodities like lumber, soybeans and orange juice. They represent contracts between two parties to buy or sell a certain amount for a specified price at a set future date. (Fail to pay attention, and you risk having to take delivery of truckloads of pork bellies!)  With S&P 500 futures, each day the party who bet wrong is obligated to pony up cash based on the price of the S&P 500. Futures are bought by some investors to protect themselves against unfavorable price swings or by speculators betting on where the market is going. They can be very risky.  Un-Foolish short-term investors pay a lot of attention to S&P futures, as they can indicate the market's likely moves before trading begins for the day. We don't fret about futures, though, remembering that for most of this century, the S&P 500 has advanced about 11 percent per year, on average.  Got some questions of your own for the Fool?

In truth, though, debt can be both bad and good.  First, the bad. If a company is saddled with a lot of debt, it's locked into interest payments that it must make. If it doesn't have the cash to cover these at any point, it's in deep doodoo. Many individuals can probably relate to this, having experienced the dark side of debt when racking up charges on credit cards.  Now, the good. Consider that most people would never be able to buy their homes without debt. Without car and school loans, many of us would probably be driving used cars and taking correspondence courses we found on matchbook covers.  Debt can be a boon for businesses, too. Many great companies, such as Federal Express and the Walt Disney Co., came to life because of early loans to their founders. Established companies can make good use of debt, as well, borrowing to expand operations and grow business. Interest payments also decrease a company's taxable income, as they're deductible. Investors willing to consider companies with debt need to evaluate whether the debt taken on is manageable and whether the capital raised and invested is earning more than it costs.  Perhaps you're worried about the debt load of Fingernail-on-Blackboard Car Alarm Co. (ticker: AIEEE). Glance at the notes in the annual report and you may find that the effective interest rate for its debt is just 5 percent. If AIEEE is putting the borrowed funds to work earning say, 8 percent, then things aren't so bad.  When companies need money, they typically have two main choices: They can issue more stock or debt. Issuing stock can dilute the value of existing shares. Issuing debt can sometimes be more efficient, as its after-tax cost can be much cheaper than equity. All things being equal, though, we prefer to see little debt on a balance sheet.  Companies that can grow without using debt or issuing extra stock are in a more powerful position than other firms. Still, you needn't balk at the first sight of debt. Just evaluate it carefully. _________________________________________________________________  IN THE SPOTLIGHT  -- Fool Phil Weiss explained in greater detail about the good, bad, and ugly aspects of debt in two Rule Maker articles.

By Chris Rugaber  To the surprise of some observers, many U.S. and international automakers reported sales declines for the month of October, with the exception of General Motors (NYSE: GM), which benefited from heavy discounts. Figures from Autodata Corp. show that industrywide sales fell 0.9% from October of last year, while forecasts were for a 3.6% increase, according to a Bloomberg report.  Sales of Ford's (NYSE: F) North American-built vehicles dropped 6.3%, partly due to a 16% decline in sales of its Explorer model. Ford cut production of the Explorer in September in order to redirect tires to the company's Explorer recall effort. The Chrysler arm of DaimlerChrysler (NYSE: DCX) reported an 8.4% drop, while Honda's (NYSE: HMC) sales fell 5.6% and Toyota (NYSE: TM) experienced a 5.7% downturn. The monthly sales decline was Honda's first since August 1998, and Toyota's first since December 1999.  GM bucked the trend, reporting a 7% increase in sales. The world's largest automaker increased its U.S. market share to 30.3%, up 2.1% since last October. What effect this will have on the company's bottom line is unclear, given that the company aggressively utilized cash-back incentives and low-rate loans, partly in response to similar efforts from Chrysler. Yesterday, GM announced new promotions for its full-size pickups, while Chrysler said earlier this week that it would offer new discounts for its 2001 minivans.  October's slowdown comes after robust sales earlier this year, and the industry is still on track to beat last year's sales record. Nevertheless, according to a Wall Street Journal report, industry observers now forecast a decline next year, from an estimated 17.2 million units in 2000 to 16.5 million in 2001, and a 5% decline in production from the ""Big Three"" U.S. automakers. _________________________________________________________________  NEWS TO GO  Media conglomerate Seagram (NYSE: VO) benefited from strong music and film sales in its fiscal first quarter (ended September 30), with profit from operations reaching $21 million, or $0.05 per share, beating analysts' estimates of $0.03 per share. Revenues dipped 2.9%, however, to $5.34 billion, which the company attributed to the strong dollar and the sales of several businesses. Paris-based Vivendi (NYSE: V) plans to purchase Seagram and this may be the company's last report as an independent entity. Shareholders for Seagram and Vivendi are scheduled to vote on the transaction on December 5, with the acquisition expected to close several days later.  Gap Inc. (NYSE: GPS) reported another decline in same-store sales yesterday. The largest U.S. clothing chain announced that October same-store sales dropped 2%, thanks to discounts on back-to-school merchandise. CFO Heidi Kunz said that the company expects a ""significant"" decline in gross margin for the third quarter (ended October 28), according to a Bloomberg report, and that earnings will be between $0.20 and $0.22 per share, below current estimates of $0.23 per share. Prior to lowering expectations in August, estimates were for the company to earn $0.41 per share. http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=179470  Domestic queen Martha Stewart Omnimedia (NYSE: MSO) reported strong revenue and earnings growth this morning, thanks to sales increases in the company's publishing, television, and Internet/direct commerce divisions. Net income more than doubled from the year-ago period to $3.8 million, or $0.08 per share, handily beating analysts' estimates of $0.01 per share. Revenue increased 24.2% to $61.9 million, from $49.8 million in last year's third quarter.  Laser-maker Coherent (Nasdaq: COHR) cut through fourth-quarter analysts' estimates last night, reporting strong sales and earnings growth and sending the company's shares up in after-hours trading. Sales jumped 18% over last year's fourth quarter to $155 million, and net income, excluding an extraordinary gain, was up 56% to $11.4 million, or $0.45 per share. The company was expected to earn $0.36 per share. Revenues for the full year were up 21% to $568.3 million, and earnings were up 61% to $36.3 million. Coherent also reported an after-tax gain of $32.3 million from its 60% ownership in a German subsidiary that went public in September. _________________________________________________________________  EDITORS' PICK  David Gardner urges you to set a date and plan to be financially independent when you retire. http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=179471 _______________________________________________________________  -News & Commentary  http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=179472  -Fool Community  http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=179473  -Post of the Day  http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=179474  -Latest Fribble  http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=179475  -Latest Market Numbers  http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=179476 ____________________________________________________________  My Portfolio: http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=179477 My Discussion Boards: http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=179478 My Fool: http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=179479 Fool.com Home: http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=179480 My E-Mail Settings: http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=179481     Sponsored By: American Express  Trade online with American Express and receive low  commissions, personalized planning tools, free news and  research and 24/7 customer service.

Small people always do that, but the really great make you believe that you too can become great."" --Mark Twain   PRICELINE THINS ITS RANKS The Internet discount company announced a third-quarter loss, the resignation of its CFO, and a restructuring plan.  By Mike Trigg  Embattled name-your-price Internet discount company priceline.com (Nasdaq: PCLN) announced a third-quarter loss after the market's close yesterday that met lowered Street expectations. In addition, the company announced the resignation of CFO Heidi Miller and a restructuring plan that includes cutting 16% of its workforce.  Priceline posted a fiscal third-quarter (ended September 30) net loss of $2 million, or $0.01 per share, compared to a lose of $11.9 million, or $0.08 per share, a year ago. Revenue came in at $341 million, slightly below expectations. Moreover, the company forecasts a sequential revenue decline for the fourth quarter, continuing to see signs of weak demand.  President and CEO Daniel Schulman blamed the revenue shortfall on negative publicity and problems with its airline ticket business. Priceline continues to be dogged by consumer complaints, highlighted by the revelation that popular company spokesman William Shatner has never used the services himself. In the airline business, the company has experienced adverse effects from rising fuel prices and airlines' own discounts.  Looking to perform some damage control, the company also announced a number of restructuring moves. Priceline announced it would fire 87 of its 535 employees, forcing it to take a charge for an undisclosed amount that will hurt fourth-quarter results. Also, the company will take a $9 million non-cash charge due to a change in a warrant held by Delta Air Lines (NYSE: DAL).  The company finished the quarter with $131 million in cash and short-term investments, not all that bad depending on the burn rate, although no guidance has been given. Nevertheless, the debate still wages on with this company regarding the survivability of is business model. With 80% of its revenues derived from airline ticket sales, it comes as no surprise that even the slightest misstep can cause damage. Of course, shutting different business lines down, such as Priceline WebHouse Club, only makes matters worse and leads many to question whether this notion of diversification is fact or fiction. At this point, we can only wait and see. _________________________________________________________________  NEWS TO GO  Mobile phone equipment company Qualcomm (Nasdaq: QCOM) reported better-than-expected fiscal fourth-quarter results after the market's close yesterday. However, revenues fell short of expectations because of slow demand in its largest market, South Korea. The San Diego-based company reported net income of $200.8 million, or $0.25 per share, compared to $182.9 million, or $0.24 per share, in the same period last year. That beat the Street consensus estimate by a penny. Revenues fell to $635 million from the year-ago figure of $716 million, a decrease of 11%. The revenue shortfall was caused by the South Korean government, which banned mobile phone discounts, cutting demand. Chairman and CEO Irwin Jacobs reiterated that CDMA-based wireless data and Internet access applications would fuel industry growth.  Information technology and consulting company Computer Sciences (NYSE: CSC) reported second-quarter earnings that met Street expectations, citing strong U.S. and international sales despite difficult conditions in Australia and Europe. The company reported earnings of $109 million, or $0.64 per share, compared to $93.1 million, or $0.55 per share, a year ago. While suffering from a weak euro, revenue still came in at $2.5 billion, a 12% increase from the year-ago period. Key announcements in the quarter include a $3 billion contract from Nortel Networks (NYSE: NT)  During an investors conference in Atlanta, United Parcel Service (NYSE: UPS) discussed the company's current performance and outlook. It noted that it's in-line to meet Street expectations for the fourth quarter, but that there could be a slowdown in the growth rate. For the coming year, company goals include revenue growth of 10%, earnings per share growth in the mid-teens, and a return on equity of about 30%. The world's largest express carrier is also expecting a strong holiday season with peak day deliveries of 19 million or greater.  The number three media company, Viacom (NYSE: VIA), announced today it has agreed to acquire privately held BET Holding II, the parent company of Black Entertainment Television. The deal is valued at $3 billion in stock and debt. BET Chairman and majority owner Robert Johnson will remain chairman and CEO of the cable channel geared to African Americans. It joins a Viacom portfolio that includes CBS, MTV, VH1, Nickelodeon, Paramount films, Infinity Broadcasting Corp., and King World Productions. Viacom Chairman and CEO Sumner Redstone noted regarding the purchase that the addition of Robert Johnson, Black Entertainment Television, and other holdings would contribute significantly to the company's existing brands and management expertise.

Huxley, biologist   CONTINENTAL, NORTHWEST DEAL DURING TRIAL With their federal court trial at hand, the two major air carriers do a deal.  By Tom Jacobs  Feeling the heat of the Department of Justice's (DOJ) antitrust trial against them, defendants Northwest Airlines (Nasdaq: NWAC) and Continental Airlines (NYSE: CAL) announced today an agreement intended to end the dispute. The DOJ sued the airlines in 1998 over a deal giving Northwest 54% voting control over Continental -- preventing Continental's takeover by Delta Air Lines (NYSE: DAL). Under the deal, Continental would buy back Northwest's common stock. The parties will ask the federal judge to delay the trial, which started last week, while the carriers work out the details.  A CAREFUL DEAL The deal has two goals: to address the DOJ's belief that the Northwest-Continental combination would lead to higher prices for consumers, and to retain the benefits of the two air powers' alliance.  The pact extends the alliance through 2025 and changes the Northwest-Continental relationship. According to the deal, Northwest will pay $450 million for 6.69 million Continental Class A shares, and hold on to 2.6 million Class B shares. Continental will recapitalize, reclassifying each Class A share into 1.32 shares of Class B common stock. Continental will issue Northwest a special series of preferred stock, which will give Northwest blocking rights over certain Continental business combinations and change of control between Continental and a third party. Continental can redeem its preferred stock under certain conditions, such as a change of control at Northwest.  A DELICATE BALANCE The industry and the government are groping in the post-deregulation era to weigh the needs of consumers against cutthroat worldwide airline competition. For example, the DOJ is separately reviewing United Airlines' (NYSE: UAL) $4.3 billion purchase of US Airways Group (NYSE: U). All the airlines have formed alliances similar to Northwest's and Continental's, involving the now-common practice of code-sharing, which means putting customers who buy tickets with one airline on the other airline's flights, and offering reciprocal frequent-flyer programs and airport lounge rights.  The trial began last week after a week's delay, during which settlement talks continued. But the trial pressure ultimately caused a change at Northwest, which rejected earlier this year Continental's buyback offer. At that time the two agreed to reduce Northwest's power over Continental's daily operations -- but it apparently didn't satisfy the DOJ.  Pending the judge's decision on the seven-day delay, Continental and Northwest plan to execute the agreement in one week. They expect it will take two months to close the deal, which would be subject to settlement of the litigation with the DOJ. _________________________________________________________________  NEWS TO GO  The Wall Street Journal reported that tobacco companies Lorillard Tobacco, owned by Loews Corp. (NYSE: LTR), and Liggett Group, owned by Miami's Vector Group (NYSE: VGR), will announce a $8 billion settlement in federal court tobacco litigation in Brooklyn. The move is said to include a 30-year payment schedule, with Lorillard paying the bulk -- $7.5 billion. The Journal reports that the parties hope to insulate themselves from liability from the Florida state court $144.87 billion judgment. The two tobacco companies split from their colleagues after the Florida verdict and have been negotiating with other plaintiffs' groups seeking a class action before U.S. Judge Jack Weinstein of Brooklyn, famed for his handling of mass tort litigation cases such as the Agent Orange and asbestos class-action lawsuits.  Santa Clara, Calif. computer chip maker Transmeta reportedly plans to hold its initial public offering this week. Transmeta makes microprocessors said to use less power and extend battery life in PC notebooks and Internet appliances. Expected investor demand led Transmeta last Friday to raise its projected IPO share price range to $16-$18 from $11-$13. Apparently, interest remains high despite last week's big news that IBM (NYSE: IBM) canceled plans to use a Transmeta chip in a new laptop computer.  Computer networking product maker 3Com (Nasdaq: COMS) agreed to settle shareholder lawsuits related to its 1997 $8.5 billion merger with U.S. Robotics. The settlement will be for $259 million. Shareholders alleged that 3Com inflated its stock price by giving rosy financial projections and delaying -- or hiding -- the news of a huge backlog of unsold U.S. Robotics modems, while executives of both companies sold 4 million shares with 3Com stock at its peak. Those who bought 3Com stock between April 23 and November 5, 1997, are eligible to share in the settlement.  After last week's decision by media giant Bertelsmann AG to ally with Napster and finance its move to a royalty-paying music service, two top executives of Bertelsmann's BMG Entertainment unit quit. Chairman Michael Dornemann and President Strauss Zelnick said they would depart, reportedly unhappy with new directions at Bertelsmann and BMG's reduced role in television and the Internet. Under Zelnick, BMG's album market share increased 50%, from 13% to 20%, and the company grew to own more than 200 record labels in 54 countries. Zelnick exits with a sweet severance package estimated at between $20 million and $50 million.

I have come to realize that it bears a very close resemblance to the first."" -- Ronald Reagan   ADOBE SWEET ADOBE The publishing giant sees higher margins ahead. Solid 2001 in store?  By Rick Aristotle Munarriz  When is less, more? For publishing software leader Adobe (Nasdaq: ADBE) it means growing operating profits next year by scaling back on research and development. The company announced its guidance at yesterday's 2000 Fall Financial Analyst Meeting.  The logic may seem absurd in this era of perpetual obsolescence. The failure to plant seeds today means less of a harvest to reap tomorrow. But Adobe feels that it can still seize the future by trimming research expenditures from 20% to just 19% of projected sales.  ""Our R&D investment is larger than the annual revenues of most of our competitors, and we do think that gives us a competitive advantage,"" Adobe President Bruce Chizen told Fool analyst Zeke Ashton back in September. So even if the company does hold back on research, it should still remain ahead of the pack. http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=184234  Like hue-tinkering on Adobe Photoshop, it appears that the prospects are brighter than the 20% growth analysts were projecting. The company expects revenue growth of at least 25% next year. With operating margins now set to climb from 31% to 32%, estimates are now poised to be revised about a dime above the $2.56 consensus.  In the meeting -- which ran just over two hours long -- the company shared its enthusiasm over its role in the new economy. Adobe has gone from a leader in the realm of desktop publishing for print media to serving as the software backbone for online and network publishing. Its ePaper Solutions segment is expected to provide a 65% growth spurt in sales next year. That's a stark contrast to the print publishing side. There the company is looking for just a 10% hike in revenue. Adobe has always known how to touch up a picture, and this horizon seems to have a crusty glow. http://www.lnksrv.com/m.asp?i=184235 _________________________________________________________________  NEWS TO GO  It's election day. Time to voice your vote. Like, what matters more, the top or the bottom line? VoiceStream Wireless (Nasdaq: VSTR) reported revenue of $562.2 million, well ahead of analyst expectations and 317% higher than last year's $134.9 million showing. Strong subscriber growth led the way. But bloated expenses found the company also producing a much wider loss than was projected. The company is in the process of being acquired by Germany's Deutsche Telekom (NYSE: DT).  Knocking chips off the global building blocks, two sources abroad warned of lower chip prices earlier today. First it was Douglas Lee, an executive director at Goldman Sachs in Asia, predicting that DRAM prices will continue to fall well into next year. Then Germany's largest semiconductor maker, Infineon Technologies (NYSE: IFX), warned of weaker demand and consequently lower prices in its memory business during the current quarter. However, Infineon reported a strong close to its fiscal year and maintains a positive outlook through the next three years thanks to growth in other high-margin businesses.  General Electric (NYSE: GE)? No. Not quite. But Dollar General (NYSE: DG) and Emerson Electric (NYSE: EMR) reported earnings this morning. Both companies held their ground with results that were in-line with analyst expectations.  Casino gaming equipment maker International Game Technology (NYSE: IGT) has beaten the house. The company trumped the quarterly estimate of $0.63 a share by reporting earnings of $0.66 before charges. The strong hand was there for the taking. All one had to do is count cards. Two weeks ago Anchor Gaming (Nasdaq: SLOT) also topped projections on the hot demand for its video gaming machines themed to television shows such as Jeopardy! and I Dream of Jeanie. Those devices are being rolled out as a joint venture involving both companies. How popular are IGT's slots and video-gaming machines? The company topped the billion-dollar mark in revenue this year.

By LouAnn Lofton  Rule Breaking biotechnology company Human Genome Sciences (Nasdaq: HGSI) reported third-quarter (ended September 30) earnings yesterday after the market's close. Revenues climbed for the drug development company, while losses widened. http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=185959  Human Genome's third-quarter revenues increased to $8.1 million, compared to $7.4 million in last year's third quarter. Included in this amount is a licensing fee the company received from MedImmune (Nadaq: MEDI), related to a SmithKline Beecham (NYSE: SBH) vaccine development deal.  The company lost $147 million in the quarter, including a onetime write-off related to the $134.1 million acquisition of Principia Pharmaceutical. Excluding this charge, Human Genome lost $13 million, or $0.12 a share. In the year-ago period, it lost $9.7 million, or $0.11 per share. Analysts as polled by First Call/Thompson Financial had expected Human Genome to lose $0.13 a share, excluding charges, so the company beat that by a penny.  Human Genome Sciences had $849.5 million in cash and short-term investments as of the close of the quarter. This compares to the $466.2 million it had in cash and short-term investments at the end of December 1999.  After the end of the third quarter, the company sold more stock to the public and raised an additional $950 million in cash. Counting that amount, Human Genome's current amount of cash and short-term investments is about $1.8 billion. The company now has about 124.8 million shares of outstanding common stock, compared to 112.1 million at the close of the third quarter.  William A. Haseltine, Human Genome's chairman and chief executive officer, said in a statement, ""We are pleased that our recent efforts have brought several HGS drugs closer to the patients who need them. At the same time, we focused on enabling scientists at HGS and our partners to discover and develop additional drugs that may aid more patients to lead healthier, more active lives."" _________________________________________________________________  NEWS TO GO  Online auction house eBay (Nasdaq: EBAY) is cutting some of its offline workers. About 15% of the employees at the eBay-owned Butterfields fine-art auction company will be losing their jobs. That equals about 32 people. eBay cut 13 jobs at the Chicago Butterfields office back in July. eBay spokesman Kevin Pursglove said, ""The management team at Butterfields came to the conclusion that they will continue to move the business to the online area.""  Good-bye, MotherNature.com (Nasdaq: MTHR). Just after we lost Pets.com (Nasdaq: IPET) and that annoyingly cute little sock puppet, MotherNature.com announced that it, too, is shutting its doors. MotherNature.com is the second venture backed by CMGI (Nasdaq: CMGI) to go belly-up this week. The other, online furniture retailer Furniture.com, announced that it's closing on Monday. MotherNature.com spent time looking for a buyer for its online vitamins and health products business, but could find no takers. The company's board of directors approved a plan to liquidate and dissolve the company on Tuesday.  Preppy-chic designer and retailer Polo Ralph Lauren (NYSE: RL) announced second-quarter results this morning. The company's sales grew by 8% to $586.2 million, compared to $543.9 million last year. Net income, before restructuring and other special charges, was $48.8 million, versus $55.3 million in the year-ago period. Earnings per diluted share on this basis were $0.50, down from last year's $0.56. The company said the reduction in net income and earnings per share was expected because of a delay in recognizing some European sales results, as well as a shift with the timing of some of its shipments.  AOL Latin America (Nasdaq: AOLA) reported first-quarter results yesterday. The Internet services provider, which is a joint venture between America Online (NYSE: AOL) and the Cisneros Group of Companies, lost $0.36 a share, or $98.1 million. Analysts had expected a loss of $0.37 a share. Revenues in the quarter were $4.6 million. AOL Latin America said it added 191,000 users in the quarter, bringing its total number of members to 314,000.

I'm embarrassed to ask such a basic question, but here goes. What does it mean when I hear, ""AT&T is up 2 1/2 today""? Is that dollars per share, or what?  -- A. Don't be embarrassed. Most of us were never taught these things in school. Asking about them is the only way to learn.  Prices of stocks are always in dollars per share. They're not always in whole numbers, though. The world of stock prices is full of fractions, all the way down to 64ths and occasionally even smaller ones. So if the film editing firm Splice Girls Inc. (ticker: SPLIC) is listed at 28, that means it last traded at $28 per share. Similarly, 15 17/32 means 15.53125 or $15.53 per share.  Another way to think of it is to consider how much total market value the company has gained or lost with each price move. Find how many shares outstanding the company has. (Do this via online stock research tools, your newspaper or the firm's financial statements.) Multiply that number by the share price. If SPLIC has 200 million shares outstanding and drops by $2 per share, the company has lost $400 million in market value.  -- Q. What are buy-side and sell-side analysts?  -- A. Buy-side analysts work in-house for institutions such as mutual funds or pension funds. They study possible investments and recommend which securities the institutions should buy or sell. Sell-side analysts work for brokerages, trying to sell their ideas to institutions. If an institution likes a brokerage's research, it might do business (placing trades) through that brokerage.  The research of sell-side analysts also makes its way to individual investors, through brokerages.  Got some questions of your own for the Fool?

Another way is to calculate its inverse, which is its ""earnings yield.""  Consider the example of Fryyndar and Ulf Scandinavian Pharmaceuticals (ticker: FANDU), whose motto is ""Vars+god och sv,lj!"" (That's Swedish for ""Here, swallow this pill!"") To calculate its P/E ratio, you simply divide the current stock price by the annual earnings per share (EPS). If its current annual EPS is $3 and the stock is trading for $111 per share, the P/E is $111 divided by $3, or 37. While 37 might seem steep, it's not meaningful until you compare it with the P/E ratios of industry peers and consider its growth prospects. A high P/E means the market is assuming rapid growth. (Is that assumption reasonable?)  To calculate Fryyndar and Ulf's earnings yield, just reverse the P/E ratio, dividing the annual EPS by the current stock price. $3 divided by $111 equals 0.027, or 2.7 percent. Compared to risk-free Treasury bond rates of roughly 5 percent, this doesn't appear to be a bargain. But remember: Whereas bond rates are fixed, earnings typically grow. Imagine that FANDU is expected to increase earnings by 10 percent per year. If so, in 10 years EPS should grow to $7.78. Assuming we bought shares when they were at $111, the earnings yield for us has now become 7 percent, considerably better. ($7.78 divided by $111 is 0.07.)  It can be instructive to see how long it takes for the growing earnings yield to pass the current 30-year bond rate, which is now about 5.5 percent. FANDU passes it in six years.  If your desired rate of return on your invested dollars is 15 percent, it will take FANDU 18 years to reach that target -- if earnings actually grow at the estimated pace, that is. Perhaps you can find another investment that will get you there more quickly. With riskier companies, you might look for them to pass your target rate sooner rather than later.  The earnings yield is just one of many investor tools. It can help you think more effectively about your expectations for investments. _________________________________________________________________  IN THE SPOTLIGHT  -- Learn more about the earnings yield in this classic ""Fool on the Hill"" article. http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=3D186702  -- Another ""Fool on the Hill"" article takes a close look at some myths surrounding Wall Street analysts. http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=3D186703  -- And now that we've raised some questions about analysts, permit us to introduce you to our own.

These change= s=20 are intended to accomplish four key objectives:  First, we need to realign all our wholesale businesses around the successfu= l=20 business model developed over the last decade in North America and Europe. = =20 This model relies on extensive physical and transactional networks built=20 around a relatively small strategic asset position.  Second, we need to significantly streamline corporate reporting=20 relationships.  Particularly with Joe Sutton=01,s departure, the ability to= =20 directly manage the day-to-day activities of 15 independent business units= =20 has become increasingly difficult.  Third, we need to accomplish these changes without, in any way, compromisin= g=20 the ongoing profitability of all our businesses and without delaying or=20 hindering our effort to monetize a significant portion of our lower-yieldin= g=20 asset positions.  And fourth, as always, we need to take advantage of the reorganization to= =20 redeploy our talent into our highest value opportunities.  ENRON WHOLESALE SERVICES  Today, we are forming Enron Wholesale Services (EWS) which will consolidate= =20 our global wholesale businesses.  The closer alignment of our wholesale=20 businesses will accomplish the following: (1) enhanced communication and=20 coordination across business units, (2) more rapid deployment of people to= =20 higher valued opportunities, (3) more effective prioritization of=20 opportunities across the wholesale business, and (4) more rapid extension o= f=20 Enron=01,s wholesale business model and capabilities into new industries an= d=20 markets.  Enron Wholesale Services will include our current North American, European= =20 (including Japan and Australia), Global Markets, and Industrial Markets=20 operations, and will be expanded to include Enron=01,s Net Works business u= nit=20 as well as a new unit =01) Enron Global Assets.  In addition, Enron=01,s me= rchant=20 businesses outside of North America and Europe will be integrated into this= =20 new structure as described below.  Mark Frevert, currently Chairman of each of our wholesale units, will assum= e=20 the role of Chairman and CEO of Enron Wholesale Services.  Greg Whalley,=20 currently Chairman and CEO of Enron Net Works, will join Mark in the Office= =20 of the Chairman as President and Chief Operating Officer.  Providing further impetus for these organizational changes, several of our= =20 international business unit leaders have elected to move into new leadershi= p=20 positions:  Rebecca McDonald, currently CEO of Enron APACHI, will join EWS as President= =20 and CEO of Enron Global Assets. Enron Global Assets will have responsibilit= y=20 for managing all of Enron=01,s existing energy asset portfolio outside of N= orth=20 America and Europe.  Joining Rebecca in the Office of the Chairman as COO= =20 will be Jim Hughes, currently COO of Enron APACHI.  Rebecca and Jim will=20 report to the EWS Office of the Chairman.  Sanjay Bhatnagar, currently CEO of Enron India, has joined EBS as CEO for t= he=20 Middle East and Asia region.  Sanjay will be responsible for building our= =20 broadband business in this region and the current EBS team in this region= =20 will report to Sanjay.  In this role, Sanjay will report to the EBS office = of=20 the Chairman.  In addition, Sanjay will continue to remain responsible for= =20 Enron=01,s wholesale energy business in India and will transition this busi= ness=20 into Enron Global Assets in the near future. =20 Diomedes Christodoulou, currently Co-CEO of Enron South America, has joined= =20 EBS as Chief Commercial Officer.  Diomedes will be located in London and wi= ll=20 focus his origination activities on global opportunities, with near term=20 attention to the wholesale and enterprise sectors.  Diomedes will report to= =20 the EBS Office of the Chairman.  Jim Bannantine, currently Co-CEO of Enron South America, will be joining EE= S=20 to lead EES=01, commercial efforts outside North America and Europe.  In or= der=20 to ensure a smooth transition for our South American businesses and to=20 facilitate our asset sales activities, Jim will remain in South America for= =20 at least the next several months and continue to serve as CEO of Enron Sout= h=20 America.  Throughout the transition, Jim will report to Cliff Baxter and to= =20 the Office of the Chairman of Enron Wholesale Services.  Following the=20 transition, Jim will join EES.  In addition to these changes in our international asset operations=20 activities, we are making the following changes in our merchant wholesale= =20 businesses and the commercial support functions:  Enron Net Works Louise Kitchen will assume Greg=01,s previous responsibilities as President=  and=20 CEO of Enron Net Works, reporting into Mark and Greg. =20  Enron Americas Concurrent with the transfer to Enron Global Assets of responsibility for= =20 operating Enron=01,s South and Central America asset base, all trading,=20 marketing, and new asset development activities in these regions will repor= t=20 into a new entity, Enron Americas.  Enron Americas will have responsibility= =20 for all wholesale merchant businesses across North, Central and South=20 America.  Dave Delainey, President and CEO, and John Lavorato, Chief=20 Operating Officer will comprise the Office of the Chairman for Enron=20 Americas.  Enron Europe The Enron Europe organization, which includes Enron=01,s businesses in Aust= ralia=20 and Japan, and Enron Metals, remains unchanged under the leadership of John= =20 Sherriff, President and CEO, and Michael Brown, Chief Operating Officer.  Enron Global Markets Enron Global Markets, under the leadership of Mike McConnell, President and= =20 CEO, and Jeff Shankman, Chief Operating Officer, will continue to have=20 responsibility for Enron=01,s Middle East and LNG operations.  With the=20 exception of Ecoelectrica in Puerto Rico, all operating power plants and=20 associated personnel in the Caribbean and Central America will transfer to= =20 Enron Global Assets.  Enron Global Markets will also continue to manage the= =20 commodity businesses in crude and products, coal, weather, insurance,=20 equities, interest rates, foreign exchange, and agricultural products.  Enron Industrial Markets Enron Industrial Markets=01, organization, under the leadership of Jeff McM= ahon,=20 President & CEO, and Ray Bowen, Chief Operating Officer, remains unchanged.  Commercial Support for EWS The commercial support functions for EWS will remain with, and be managed b= y,=20 the individual business units.  We are creating no incremental overhead in= =20 the creation of EWS, and in fact hope to reduce our operating costs by more= =20 efficient utilization and sharing of resources across EWS.  To this end we have asked several people to take on an expanded role across= =20 EWS in addition to their ongoing roles within their business units.  These= =20 newly defined roles are as follows:  Mid and Back Office Operations =01) Sally Beck will lead Mid and Back Offic= e=20 Operations across EWS.  These services will become part of Enron Net Works,= =20 with Sally reporting to Louise Kitchen and Rick Causey, Executive Vice=20 President and Chief Accounting Officer.  This alignment creates a coordinat= ed=20 services organization with IT and e-commerce platforms to support the=20 wholesale businesses and to maximize opportunities to commercialize these= =20 services.  Mid and Back Office services for all commercial activities will= =20 continue to be organized with dedicated operations controllers responsible= =20 for specific commodities and/or geographic locations. Legal =01) Mark Haedicke will serve in the role of General Counsel for EWS. Regulatory and Government Affairs =01) This function will remain organized = on a=20 regional basis.  Rick Shapiro will support all EWS businesses operating in= =20 the Americas, and Mark Schroeder, who is based in London, will support all= =20 European and Eastern Hemisphere operations.  Rick and Mark will also contin= ue=20 to support all other Enron businesses operating in their respective regions= =20 and will continue to report to Steve Kean, Executive Vice President and Chi= ef=20 of Staff. Public Relations =01) This function is also organized primarily on a region= al=20 basis.  Eric Thode will have responsibility for North American activity,=20 Enron Net Works, and Enron Industrial Markets.  Jackie Gentle will continue= =20 in her role for Enron Europe (including Japan and Australia) and John Amble= r=20 will have responsibility for activity outside North America and Europe as= =20 well as providing support for Enron Global Markets and Enron Global Assets.=  =20 These individuals will also continue to have a split reporting relationship= =20 to Mark Palmer, Vice President of Communications.

Attached for your review is an organization chart for Enron Wholesale=20 Services which summarizes the changes described here.  As this organization= =20 continues to evolve we will keep you informed of any additional changes.  ENRON GLOBAL EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION AND ENRON WIND   As part of our company-wide initiative to examine our assets and investmen= ts=20 around the world, we are considering a variety of options with respect to= =20 EGEP and EWC.  As a consequence, we are putting these businesses under Clif= f=20 Baxter=01,s direction.  Jeff Sherrick, CEO of EGEP, and Jim Noles, CEO of E= nron=20 Wind, will report to Cliff.

REPORTS DROP IN EARNINGS The company's profits decline due to a ratings downturn at the Fox TV network.  By Chris Rugaber  Multinational media conglomerate News Corp. (NYSE: NWS) reported a decline in profits for its fiscal first quarter last night, thanks to an accounting change and reduced ad revenues from its Fox TV network.  After-tax operating profit fell to $149 million, or $0.14 per American depositary receipt (ADR), from $165 million, or $0.16 per ADR, in the year-earlier period. (Like most other non-U.S. based companies, News Corp. shares trade as ADRs.) The reduced profits did meet average analysts' estimates. Revenues rose 2.6% to $3.24 billion.  Thanks to a change in accounting for the company's film business, News Corp. took a non-cash charge of $417 million, resulting in a net loss for the quarter of $268 million, or $0.27 per ADR. All Hollywood studios have been adjusting their finances to reflect new accounting standards, which affect marketing and development costs, among other things.  The decline in News Corp.'s operating profits was primarily a result of lower ratings and advertising revenue for the Fox TV network, which suffered from the success of CBS's Survivor and the Olympics on NBC. The No. 4 U.S. network posted an operating loss of $31 million, compared to $20 million in operating earnings a year earlier. The network also reported higher production and marketing costs, which may explain all those promotions for the new series Dark Angel.  As a result, News Corp.'s separately traded U.S. media subsidiary, the Fox Entertainment Group (NYSE: FOX), which owns the television network and the 20th Century Fox film studio, reported a 16% drop in fiscal first-quarter operating profit. While the film studio's cash flow almost doubled to $119 million, from $62 million a year ago -- thanks largely to the success of the movie X-Men -- this did not offset the declines in television ad revenues.  Overall, profits declined in three of the six operating divisions of the company -- television, magazines, and newspapers -- while earnings improved for the movie studio, cable, and publishing businesses. CEO Rupert Murdoch noted in a conference call that the company planned to proceed with an IPO of its satellite unit, Sky Global Networks, in the first calendar quarter of next year. _________________________________________________________________  NEWS TO GO  The tougher climate for online businesses claimed more casualties yesterday, as B2B holding company Internet Capital Group (Nasdaq: ICGE) announced that it would cut 50 jobs, or 35% of its workforce, and take a charge of $25 million to $30 million to pay for the cuts. The company's shares fell $3.50 in after-hours trading to $12.75, on top of a 90% drop so far this year. Investors in the company may be relieved to know that, according to CEO Walter Buckley, ""We're very much moving from a land grab area to an execution area.""  The drama continues at speech-recognition company Lernout & Hauspie (Nasdaq: LHSP), makers of Dragon and Dictaphone software, as the company's co-founders stepped down from their executive positions today. The company will also delay its 10-Q filing as it restates results for 1998, 1999, and the first half of this year due to errors the company found in an internal audit. But wait, there's more bad news: The company also said that third-quarter revenue would fall short of previous forecasts by about 24%.  ABC's hit show Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? continues to reward parent company Disney (NYSE: DIS), which today reported a fiscal fourth-quarter profit of $167 million, or $0.11 per share, thanks in part to increased ad sales at ABC. Excluding the company's Internet properties, Disney earned $0.20 per share, $0.02 ahead of consensus estimates. The company lost $126 million, or $0.02 per share, in last year's fiscal fourth quarter. Revenues rose 5.8% to $6.12 billion. For the full year, the company reported revenue growth of 9% to $25 billion, and net income of $1.9 billion, or $1.92 per share.  Warren Buffett's holding company Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A) announced last night that it will purchase paint maker Benjamin Moore for about $1 billion in cash. Berkshire will pay $37.82 per share for the company, a 51% premium to yesterday's closing price. New Jersey-based Benjamin Moore makes home exterior and interior paints, and is the second housing-related acquisition for Berkshire in recent months. The company purchased carpet-maker Shaw Industries in September. _________________________________________________________________  EDITORS' PICK  Is the hype surrounding Web-hosting giant Exodus really too good to be true?

Patton   NVIDIA KEEPS CHIPPIN' Nvidia has overtaken ATI Technologies as the largest maker of graphic-enhancing chips for desktop computers.  By Mike Trigg  Computer graphic chip maker Nvidia (Nasdaq: NVDA) reported better-than-expected third-quarter results after the market's close yesterday, citing market share gains attributable to original equipment manufacturers' (OEM) and system builders' rapid adoption of its GPU technologies. The company maintained a robust growth outlook, expanding out of its core desktop business.  Nvidia's fiscal third-quarter (ended October 31) net income was $28.1 million, or $0.35 per share, compared to $10.6 million, or $0.15 per share, in the comparable period a year ago. The Street consensus estimate called for the company to earn $0.32 per share. Moreover, revenues came in at $198.2 million, more than doubling year-over-year from $97 million. And operating income grew 142% to $36.6 million.  According to a new study this week by Mercury Research, Nvidia has overtaken ATI Technologies (Nasdaq: ATYT) as the largest maker of graphic-enhancing chips for desktop computers. For the third quarter, Nvidia chips were in 48% of all desktop computers, increasing more than twofold from a year ago.  Meanwhile, ATI's desktop market share slipped five percentage points to 34%. However, in the laptop market, ATI expanded its market share from 29% in the same period a year ago to 57%, highlighted by new contracts with IBM (NYSE: IBM) and Dell (Nasdaq: DELL). Despite losing money in the last two quarters, ATI expects to re-enter the black in the current quarter (ends November 30). Nevertheless, Nvidia's gains continue to look impressive in comparison to the competition.  The Santa Clara, Calif.-based Nvidia has made significant gains winning over longtime ATI customers, including Compaq Computer (NYSE: CPQ) and Gateway (NYSE: GTW). According to the Street, the shift has occurred because Nvidia has been more successful at rolling out improved chips every six months. In a press release yesterday, CEO and President Jen-Hsun Huang cited its newest GeForce chip, the GeForce2 Ultra, as cause for its expanding leadership position.  The other competitive force, 3Dfx Interactive (Nasdaq: TDFX), is coming off a disappointing July quarter when revenue was less than half of what the Street expected. The company attributed the shortfall to component shortages and ""competitive and retail seasonality factors."" Similarly, the company announced it would report disappointing results for the quarter ending in October.  AFTER-HOURS COVERAGE  DELL ANNOUNCES Q3  Direct PC seller Dell announced third-quarter results after the market's close today, in line with the consensus Street expectation. With speculation throughout the day looming that Dell had ""juiced"" revenue numbers at quarter's end, shares traded down roughly 6% to close at $28.38. The company also reconfirmed earlier guidance that called for sales to rise 27% year-over-year, slightly below the 30% growth the company was expecting earlier in the year. FULL STORY>> http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=189395 _________________________________________________________________  NEWS TO GO  Guess what? Sexy jeans retailer Guess (NYSE: GES) announced third-quarter profits after the market's close well below Street expectations, citing excess inventory and a difficult retail environment. Guess reported third-quarter profits of $5.6 million, or $0.13 per share, compared to $14.2 million, or $0.33 per share, in the year-ago period. That's well below the Street consensus expecting $0.36 per share. Inventory levels at quarter's end were $164.2 million, up from $94.2 million last year. Total revenue increased 39% year-over-year to $216.4 million. Guess also revised its fourth-quarter outlook, now calling for earnings to be $0.08 per share to $0.10 per share. The Street estimate called for $0.36 per share.  Construction and industrial supplies distributor Hughes Supply (NYSE: HUG) reported that it would miss third-quarter and full-year estimates. The company expects earnings between $0.75 per share and $0.79 per share, down from $0.87 per share in the same period last year. The consensus Street estimate had called for $0.93 per share. Sales for the quarter should come in at $860 million, about 10% lower than expected. The company expects full-year sales growth of 9% to 11%, and full-year earnings between $2.75 per share and $2.80 per share. The slower-than-expected growth was attributed to commodity pricing exposure for many plumbing and building materials products.  You learn real good! Computer training company Learning Tree International (Nasdaq: LTRE) posted solid fourth-quarter and full-year results after the market's close yesterday. Learning Tree reported earnings of $9.1 million, or $0.40 per share, compared to $5.7 million, or $0.26 per share, one year ago. That's well ahead of the Street consensus of $0.36 per share. Moreover, the Orlando, Florida-based company pulled in $56 million in sales, increasing 21% from $48.5 million in the same period last year. For the entire fiscal year, Learning Tree earned $50.4 million, or $1.65 per share, compared to $14.7 million, or $0.57 per share, last year.  Managed healthcare service provider PacifiCare Health Systems (Nasdaq: PHSY) reported a significant drop in third-quarter net income, citing rising medical costs related to the company's transition from capitated contracts to per-diem, fee-for-service or shared-risk arrangements with hospitals. The Santa Ana, Calif.-based company turned in earnings of $5.2 million, or $0.15 per share, compared to $69.3 million, or $1.54 per share, in the year-ago period. The Street consensus called for a $0.07-per-share loss. Results reported for the quarter include a $3.8 million credit, or $0.11 per share, related to the early termination of a license agreement. Results for the same period last year reflected a $1.7 million net charge, or a $0.04-per-share loss, for impairment and disposition activities. Revenue were $2.87 billion, increasing 14% from $2.52 billion.

By Tom Jacobs  Holding company Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A) announced Q3 earnings Friday of $523 per Class A share, 90% over last year's $276. While earnings from operations jumped from last year's $103 to $197, Berkshire also reaped substantial investment gains. Class A shares closed Friday unchanged at $62,200, while the Class B shares (non-voting shares worth 1/30th of each Class A) for the commoners finished up $11 at $2043.  Warren Buffett and Charles Munger steer Berkshire, whose wholly owned businesses include insurance, aviation, newspaper, candy, shoe, jewelry, and home furnishing companies. Berkshire also maintains large stock holdings in energy and name-brand U.S. stocks, such as Gillette (NYSE: G) and Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO). Because of Berkshire's holdings and insurance business, not many analysts follow the company -- The Motley Fool has one -- and the quarterly numbers are not as simple as they seem. For one thing, Berkshire's numbers vary considerably quarter-to-quarter, and much of the insurance business action occurs in the fourth quarter. http://www.lnksrv.com/m.asp?i=191757 http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=191758  A big factor for an insurance business is float -- money paid in premiums that the insurer invests in hopes of a greater gain against future payout for claims. Berkshire's float increased by a healthy $1.3 billion in Q3. But underwriting losses at its General Re unit -- which have plagued Berkshire in the last several years --continued, with another $135 million loss on a contract there. However, Buffett believes that the loss will mean future investment benefits, stating, ""From time to time we will have such transactions in the future and we will post you of their effects upon our current earnings. When priced properly, this pain-today, gain-tomorrow business is welcomed by us and benefits our shareholders."" I'm one of those, and you gotta love words like that from a CEO.  Buffett observed that advertising spent for Berkshire's GEICO insurance unit has not realized more than a nominal gain in policyholders. GEICO plans to cut back advertising for now, and Buffett believes that increased rates will lead to some improvement in profitability next year.  The quarter saw more Berkshire moves into home furnishings, with proposed purchases of Shaw Industries (NYSE: SHX) and Benjamin Moore Paint. Berkshire shareholders tend to be rabid about their company and are already debating the numbers. http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=191759 _________________________________________________________________  NEWS TO GO  Fresh pork and processed meat producer and marketer Smithfield Foods (NYSE: SFD) offered to acquire all outstanding stock of No. 1 U.S. beef producer IBP (NYSE: IBP). The other white meat maker would pay $4.1 billion in stock and assumed debt for what's for dinner. This means Smithfield pays $25 per IBP share, 20% above IBP's Friday close of $20.88.  The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers meets this week in Marina del Rey, California, with its 800 members leading up to adding as many as 14 new domain names to join existing Internet suffixes .org, .com, .net, .edu, and .gov. New names would mean competition for VeriSign (Nasdaq: VRSN) ) whose Network Solutions purchase gave it control over the database for .com, .org, and .net. -- with full pricing and registration power. ICANN received 44 complete applications at $50,000 a crack. Some names reported include .web, .biz, .ecom, and .info for general topics; .nom, .per, and .i for personal home pages; and .health, .museum, and .union for specific content. (And .tom9 for -- just kidding!) ICANN has taken some heat for rejecting .kids and .xxx for porn sites, but ICANN staff held firm, saying that defining kids' sites would be problematic, and that porn sites couldn't be forced to take an .xxx suffix. The board's 19 members will act Thursday and it's reported that the new domains will be operational in Q2 2001.  Netpliance (Nasdaq: NPLI) announced Sunday it would cut 38% of its workforce and refocus its business away from its poor-selling I-Opener Internet appliance, which combined the device with Internet access and Netpliance's consumer portal. Netpliance reported Friday a $41.9 million loss, or $0.69 per share, versus a loss of $6.5 million, or $0.20 per share, a year ago. The company intends to reorganize into two business units: Netpliance.net, offering next-generation services and hosted applications to broadband service providers, and Netpliance IPG, which will develop core infrastructure products to be installed in data centers, points-of-presence, and residential access devices. Though the company had $76.6 million in cash at the end of the September quarter, it's hard to see how it can expect to make headway in this area already filled with cash-rich competitors.  A federal court in Delaware has ruled against GeneChip DNA array maker Affymetrix (Nasdaq: AFFX) in favor of the U.K.'s Oxford Gene Technology in a patent infringement case involving technology fundamental to Affymetrix's product technology. Two weeks ago a British appeals court ruled in favor of Affymetrix that it had a license when it purchased part of Beckman Coulter (NYSE: BEC) in 1999. According to reports, the U.S. court agreed with the British court on the Beckman Coulter-Affymetrix license transfer, so the sole issue is a 17-month period when Affymetrix paid no royalties to Oxford. Oxford sought $40 million -- which will not be tripled because the court reportedly found that Affymetrix did not willfully or knowingly infringe the patents. Affymetrix expects about $190 million in revenues from its GeneChip arrays and related equipment this year. CEO Stephen Fodor stated that ""We don't think [the decision] will have a long-term effect. Our future is secure. So we're now talking about the past -- of about 17 months at the most and no trebling of damages.''  Reuters reports that chip giant Intel (Nasdaq: INTC) will announce two new Celeron processors chips, running at 733 megahertz and 766 megahertz, to further its hold on the sub-$1,000 PC market in the face of stiffening competition from Advanced Micro Devices (NYSE: AMD). AMD currently has the speediest chip on the market and is said to be undercutting Intel on price by 25%. The 766 will cost $170 per thousand and the 733 will cost $112 per thousand, giving you a pretty good idea of where the prices are in a low-cost PC box. Intel said that Compaq (NYSE: CPQ) and Hewlett-Packard (NYSE: HWP) will introduce systems using the chips. _________________________________________________________________  EDITORS' PICK  Todd Lebor shares four simple yet profound investing mantras he learned from his Grandfather. http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=191760 _______________________________________________________________  -News & Commentary  http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=191761  -Fool Community  http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=191762  -Post of the Day  http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=191763  -Latest Fribble  http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=191764  -Latest Market Numbers  http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=191765 ____________________________________________________________  My Portfolio: http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=191766 My Discussion Boards: http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=191767 My Fool: http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=191768 Fool.com Home: http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=191769 My E-Mail Settings: http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=191770    Sponsored By: InvestorPlace.com  Cisco.

By Rick Aristotle Munarriz  4M? Minnesota Mining & Manufacturing (NYSE: MMM) will add touchscreen specialist MicroTouch (Nasdaq: MTSI) to its conglomerate in a $160 million acquisition.  For MicroTouch shareholders, the $21-a-share cash buyout price finds the stock fetching levels it hasn't seen since 1997. The landscape was much kinder then. Demand for the company's touchscreen offerings ran high. Through 1998, sales growth was running at an annualized clip of 35% over the five previous years.  Then the fundamentals went insane in the resistive membrane. So far this year the company has had to close down its Australian office and look into fiduciary improprieties in Taiwan. The company has divested itself of its once-promising Ibid digital whiteboards and its Factura high-tech kiosks. The touchscreen operations that remain have grown the top line by a paltry 5% over the first nine months of the year. http://www.lnksrv.com/m.asp?i=193903 http://www.lnksrv.com/m.asp?i=193904 http://www.lnksrv.com/m.asp?i=193905  Last week the company reported that it was engaged in sale negotiations. 3M was a logical suitor since the company had entered into the touchscreen market with its acquisition of Dynapro Systems over the summer.  Dow component 3M trades at two times trailing revenues and it is buying out MicroTouch at roughly the total sales over the past year. But will the deal be accretive to the bottom line? MicroTouch is struggling with profitability right now. But if 3M is able to steer MicroTouch back into the operating groove the company mastered in 1998, then, yes, definitely. The Post-It reminder to pick up MicroTouch in order to become the top dog in the touchscreen space will be worth it. http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=193906 _________________________________________________________________  NEWS TO GO  Super Selection at Everyday Low Gross Margins! That's not the official Wal-Mart (NYSE: WMT) slogan, but the company that Sam Walton founded on producing financial results through whirlwind inventory turnover on meager markups reported earnings in-line with projections this morning. Sales climbed by 13% to $45.7 billion while earnings per share rose two pennies to $0.31 a share -- a 6% gain. Uh-oh. That's falling net margins. However, same-store sales climbed by 5% and the company's international sales shot up 26%.  It's a big day for other retailers too. Home Depot (NYSE: HD) is set to erect its quarterly report while Target (NYSE: TGT) has its earnings conference call slated for 10:30 a.m. ET. After yesterday's close, Too (NYSE: TOO) reported earnings that came in a penny ahead of estimates. The specialty retailer that was spun off by Limited (NYSE: LTD) also expressed comfort with the December quarter forecasts.  Meanwhile, the investing community is fumbling for a Staples (Nasdaq: SPLS) remover after the company reported earnings that came in below analyst projections. The office supply superstore chain also said that profits would fall short of expectations for the current quarter. However, it does see growth of at least 30% next year.  Medic! The bleeding at WebMD (Nasdaq: HLTH) is running more profuse than once feared. The company reported a wider-than-expected loss for its quarterly checkup. As the company begins to digest recent acquisitions, WebMD is looking at a deficit next year of between $75 million and $100 million. The prognosis calls for massive restructuring that finds the company having to reduce previous revenue guidance for 2001. Thankfully the company is cash-rich and debt-free. No one is calling Dr. Koop for a second opinion, yet.  Stop the presses -- Cisco (Nasdaq: CSCO) is buying a company. OK, keep the presses rolling, the networking titan does this all the time. The target of Cisco's affections is Australian high-speed chipset developer Radiata in a $295 million transaction. Onward.

By LouAnn Lofton  Integrated circuit maker Analog Devices (NYSE: ADI) reported fourth-quarter and fiscal year-end results yesterday after the bell. The company earned $0.54 a share in the fourth quarter, ahead of the First Call/Thompson Financial consensus estimate by $0.04. In last year's fourth quarter, Analog Devices earned $0.20.  Sales for the quarter were up 87% to $806 million from $431 million in the year-ago period. Net income increased to $206.5 million, compared to $73.2 million last year. The company's gross margin improved during the quarter to 58.6% from 52.2%.  For the fiscal year, Analog Devices earned $588.8 million on sales of $2.58 billion. In the previous fiscal year, the company's sales were $1.45 billion, and its net income was $204.8 million. On a per-share basis, Analog Devices earned $1.54 a share in fiscal 2000, versus $0.57 in fiscal 1999.  The company also announced yesterday that it will be repurchasing up to 15 million shares of its common stock. Currently, there are about 356 million shares of Analog Devices common stock outstanding. The shares are being bought back for use in the company's stock option plans, as well as other employee stock-based benefit plans.  Looking ahead to the first quarter of its new fiscal year, Analog Devices expects 7-10% sequential revenue growth. The company sees first-quarter earnings per share to come in between $0.58 and $0.60 a share. The current consensus estimate for Analog Devices' first quarter is $0.54. The company says it believes its revenue growth will be constrained by supply, not demand.  Analog Devices' President and CEO Jerald G. Fishman said, ""Our first look for the entire year of fiscal 2001 is also very encouraging. We currently believe that fiscal 2001's revenues could exceed fiscal 2000's by more than 50%, which would result in fiscal 2001 revenues of more than $3.8 billion."" _________________________________________________________________  NEWS TO GO  In an SEC filing yesterday, it was disclosed that the man who has for so long believed in Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO) also apparently believes at least a little in Pepsi (NYSE: PEP). Warren Buffett's company Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A) has acquired about a 1% stake in Tricon Global Restaurants (NYSE: YUM), the Pepsi spin-off that includes fast-food restaurants Pizza Hut, Taco Bell, and KFC. Close to 98% of those restaurants serve Pepsi products. Buffett owns 8.1% of Coca-Cola and is also a director for the company.  Ford Motor Company (NYSE: F) said yesterday that it will allow customers ordering new 2001 Explorers to elect to have Goodyear tires on their vehicles over the standard Firestones. This move formally allows customers to have the new Explorers delivered with Goodyear tires, as opposed to switching off the Firestones for the Goodyears before the purchase. It's estimated that between 5-10% of Explorer customers have been asking dealers to change the tires on their new trucks before driving them off of the lot, thanks to the Firestone recall of 6.5 million tires. In states where the tire problems were the worst, up to 40% of customers have been asking for the switch.  E-commerce software company BEA Systems (Nasdaq: BEAS) reported third-quarter earnings yesterday after the bell. The company's pro forma net income was $31.3 million, or $0.07 a share. Last year, the company's pro forma net income was $10.4 million, or $0.03 a share. BEA beat the consensus estimate according to First Call/Thompson Financial by a penny. Revenues grew 77% to $244 million, from last year's $126.5 million.  Optical networking company Sycamore Networks (Nasdaq: SCMR) announced fiscal first-quarter results after the market's close yesterday. Sycamore's pro forma net income was $6 million, or $0.02 a diluted share, for the quarter. Last year, it lost $4.1 million, or $0.02 a share, in the first quarter. The company earned a penny more than analysts had expected. Revenues grew by 517% to $120.4 million, compared to the year-ago period's $19.5 million. _________________________________________________________________  EDITORS' PICK  Our writers love to share their opinions, so we asked them to provide a list of blue-chip stocks they find interesting. http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=195696 _______________________________________________________________  -News & Commentary  http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=195697  -Fool Community  http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=195698  -Post of the Day  http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=195699  -Latest Fribble  http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=195700  -Latest Market Numbers  http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=195701 ____________________________________________________________  My Portfolio: http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=195702 My Discussion Boards: http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=195703 My Fool: http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=195704 Fool.com Home: http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=195705 My E-Mail Settings: http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=195706    Sponsored By: iShares  iShares(SM).

I want to open a brokerage account, but the firms I called require between $1,000 and $5,000 upfront, just to open an account. What can I do?  -- A. Many brokerages don't have minimums. Details about and ratings for scores of discount brokerages, both traditional and online, can be found in SmartMoney magazine, the American Association of Individual Investors Journal and other periodicals. Online brokerages are also reviewed and rated at gomez.com. http://www.lnksrv.com/m.asp?i=3D196114  Note that commissions for discount brokerages have fallen to as low as $5 or $10 per trade. (And some of them are offering free trades to those with certain minimum balances.) This is a far cry from the typical discount commission of $30 to $50 a few years ago and the hundreds of dollars that some full-service brokerages will still charge you today.  -- Q. I'm 14 years old. How much risk should I apply to what I'm investing?  -- A. We love questions like this! If only all 14-year olds were learning about investing.  Anyone can afford to take on some risk by investing in stocks -- as long as the money won't be withdrawn within the next five or more years. If the money you're investing is for college, stocks aren't a good idea, as the market could drop in the short term. Those investing for the long haul can patiently ride out downturns. Short-term investors should stick to safer plays, like money market funds.  You're smart to start young. Let's say you invest $500 and it earns the average annual market rate of 11 percent. In 30 years, when you're only 44, it'll become $11,446. Sock it away until retirement at 65 and it'll be nearly $100,000. Add to it over the years and you're looking at early retirement!

She may thank you one day from the bottom of her wallet.  Many women (and men, too) are steering clear of the stock market, and they're paying a high price for it. Consider these facts. Wives tend to be less involved than husbands in household investing and retirement planning. Most married women outlive their husbands. Fully 80 percent of all widows in poverty became poor only after the death of their husbands. In 1992, 87 percent of the elderly poor in America were women.  If we've now depressed you, hold on. There's good news, too. More women are investing today than in the past. A 1997 study commissioned by the National Association of Securities Dealers found that 47 percent of investors were women, up from 37 percent in 1990.  When women invest, they can do very well. According to recent National Association of Investors Corp. (NAIC) statistics, the average annual lifetime return for all-women investment clubs was 17.9 percent, compared with 15.6 percent for all-men clubs (in 1997). Brad Barber and Terrance Odean, professors at the University of California at Davis business school, offer an explanation. In a 1998 study, they found that men are more likely than women to be overconfident and to trade frequently. Single men, for example, traded 67 percent more than single women, reaping lower returns.  Here are some guidelines for women -- and heck, men -- interested in getting started:  1. Take the time to learn first. Don't jump into any investment without understanding it and being comfortable with it. Read ""One Up on Wall Street"" by Peter Lynch or our ""You Have More Than You Think."" http://www.lnksrv.com/m.asp?i=3D196117 http://www.lnksrv.com/m.asp?i=3D196118  2. Don't be afraid to take on some risk. Sticking to low-risk choices like bonds or money market funds dooms you to lower returns. As long as you're investing for five to ten or more years, you can afford to ride out any short-term market downturns.  3. Consider forming an investment club. Learn how with the NAIC at better-investing.org. http://www.lnksrv.com/m.asp?i=3D196119 _________________________________________________________________  IN THE SPOTLIGHT  -- Thinking about opening a new brokerage account?

By Chris Rugaber  Leading semiconductor equipment maker Applied Materials (Nasdaq: AMAT) reported strong fourth-quarter results after the closing bell yesterday, doubling profits on an 81% increase in sales. However, the company also warned that fiscal first-quarter earnings would miss current forecasts.  Nevertheless, the company's fourth quarter (ended October 29) was solid, to say the least. Net income jumped to $663.8 million, or $0.77 per share, from $303.8 million, or $0.37 per share, in last year's fourth quarter. Analysts expected the company to earn $0.76 per share. Sales reached $2.92 billion, up from $1.61 billion, while new orders more than doubled to $3.6 billion and backlog increased to $4.38 billion, from $3.69 billion last year. Margins also improved, with gross margin increasing to 51.7%, up from 49.6% in the year-earlier period, and net margin rising to 22.7%, 3.9 points higher than the year-earlier figure.  Despite the strong showing, the company is cautious about future results, which is not too surprising given the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry. While Applied Materials benefited from capacity increases at many chipmakers earlier this year, concerns over slowing mobile phone and PC sales have muddied the waters regarding revenue and earnings for the second half of next year. ""Conditions in our industry have become more complex and uncertain,"" Chief Financial Officer Joseph Bronson told Bloomberg News. ""It is unclear what the impact of this uncertainty will be on our markets.""  For next quarter, the company stated that earnings per share (EPS) were likely to come in between $0.75 and $0.78, below current analysts' estimates of $0.80. Revenue should be between $2.9 billion and $2.95 billion, below previous expectations of $3.12 billion.  Investors that have held on through Applied Materials' ups and downs have done pretty well over the years, though recent times have been tougher. For more information about the company, check out a Daily Double from Rick Munarriz this past spring. http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=198636 http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=198637 _________________________________________________________________  NEWS TO GO  In a long-expected move, AT&T (NYSE: T) announced yesterday that it would spin off cable TV programming division Liberty Media (NYSE: LMG.A), which it received as part of its purchase of cable giant Tele-Communications, Inc. last year. While the decision is dependent on a favorable tax ruling, AT&T plans to convert the company's tracking stock to an asset-based equity and distribute shares to holders of the tracking stock in the second quarter of 2001. By selling Liberty, which owns stakes in the E! Entertainment Network and Courtroom Television Network, AT&T may satisfy regulatory conditions placed on it for the approval of its purchase of cable operator MediaOne Group.  The mega-merger between America Online (NYSE: AOL) and Time Warner (NYSE: TWX) may be delayed past the two companies' self-imposed deadline of December 21, according to a report in today's Wall Street Journal. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) wants the two companies to strike a cable-access deal with an Internet service provider (ISP) as a condition of the merger, and last week the FTC delayed a vote on the merger until November 30 to give the two companies time to strike a deal with an ISP. Nevertheless, the FTC would have to approve a cable-access deal before the merger vote, and may not be able to do so in time. The Journal also reported that the two companies disagreed on strategy, as Time Warner wanted last week's vote to proceed, while AOL did not. An AOL vice president denied that there were any disagreements.  Retailer Nordstrom (NYSE: JWN) reported dismal third-quarter earnings after yesterday's market close. The company, under new management led by Nordstrom family members, saw profit from operations drop 41% to $23.4 million, or $0.18 per share, from $39.7 million, or $0.29 per share, in the year-earlier period. Sales rose 13%, to $1.25 billion, from $1.11 billion. The company used steep price markdowns to clear out summer and fall merchandise, and also saw an increase in operating expenses, with sales, general and administrative (SG&A) costs jumping to 34.8% of revenue from 31.7% a year earlier.  The world's second-largest auction house, Sotheby's (NYSE: BID), reported a disappointing third quarter and warned that fourth-quarter and fiscal 2000 earnings would be below last year's. Third-quarter sales dropped 6%, from $45.3 million last year to $42.6 million, and losses from operations increased to $0.45 per share, from $0.41. In addition, the company took a pre-tax charge of $184.8 million, or $2.68 per share, as a result of its settlement of shareholder lawsuits and an antitrust investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice. The company pleaded guilty last month to conspiring with its rival Christie's on auction commission fees.

If you have formed a conclusion from the facts and if you know your judgment is sound, act on it -- even though others may hesitate or differ."" -- Benjamin Graham   VA LINUX DOWN, BUT NOT OUT Open-source software provider VA Linux reported first-quarter results, meeting revised expectations.  By Mike Trigg  VA Linux (Nasdaq: LNUX), which makes software and computers using the Linux operating system, reported its first-quarter outcome after the market's close yesterday, in-line with revised estimates. It was less than two weeks ago when the Freemont, California-based company warned results would fall short of expectations, citing slow sales growth from dot-com customers. The market reacted harshly from that news with shares plummeting 42% in one day.  Excluding non-cash items, VA Linux's fiscal first-quarter (ended October 27) net loss was $7 million, or $0.15 per share, compared to a net loss of $7.2 million, or $0.27 per share, in the year-ago period. The Street had expected a loss of $0.09 per share prior to the warning. On the top line, the open-source software provider reported $56.1 million in revenues, compared to $14.8 million in the same period last year.  ""While top and bottom-line results did not meet our expectations for the quarter, we remain optimistic about our prospects for growth in the future. We remain committed to profitability, excluding non-cash charges, no later than the end of calendar 2001, and we anticipate revenue for fiscal 2001 to be approximately 2.25 times fiscal 2000 revenue,'' said President and CEO Dr. Larry M. Augustin.  VA Linux's stock, which closed last night at $12, is down significantly from its 52-week high of $320. Clearly, the days of unabashed enthusiasm for Linux stocks are gone. However, investors continue to keep companies like VA Linux on the radar, and being profitable one year from now would help the company's prospects.  Management's ability to control costs while growing revenues is critical. The other key to success will be monitoring the commercial acceptance of Linux-based products, particularly among Fortune 1000 companies. The fact remains that Linux products are still something that appeal more to techies, and until that changes investors will continue to have doubts about VA Linux's ability to succeed _________________________________________________________________  NEWS TO GO  Caffeine haven Starbucks (Nasdaq: SBUX) announced fourth-quarter earnings after the market's close yesterday. The company (excluding non-cash items) reported income of $43.8 million, or $0.22 per share, compared to $32.4 million, or $0.17 per share, a year ago. That's a 35% increase. The Street consensus called for the company to earn $0.22 per share. Revenues for the quarter were $582 million, compared to $475 million a year ago. Including non-cash charges to write down Internet investments, Starbucks' profit was $0.01 per share. Same-sales stores grew 10%.  Southeastern U.S. local-phone company BellSouth Corp. (NYSE: BLS) announced it expects earnings per share to grow between 7% and 9% next year. The company previously forecasted 13% to 15% growth. According to a spokesperson, the new estimate includes the cost of entering Colombia and adding more customers for digital subscriber line (DSL) Internet access, which was not factored into the original forecast. BellSouth expects customers for DSL service to expand threefold to 600,000 next year, reducing earnings by $0.07 per share. Colombian acquisitions are expected to cut earnings another $0.06 per share for the year.  Computer networking chipmaker Marvell Technology Group (Nasdaq: MRVL) reported third-quarter results after the market's close last night, exceeding Street expectations. Marvell's net income was $1.8 million, or $0.02 per share. Excluding stock compensation costs, profit was $3.4 million, or $0.04 per share, compared to $5.5 million, or $0.07 per share, a year ago, exceeding Street expectations by a penny. Revenue came in at $36.2 million, a 54% year-over-year increase.  Semiconductor company Dallas Semiconductor (NYSE: DS) announced that Chairman, CEO, and President Vin Prothro died yesterday after suffering a heart attack. Prothro founded the company in 1984 and had served in his current duties since its inception. The company announced its board would meet soon to start the process of naming a successor. The 58-year-old Prothro had no history of heart problems. Before trading was halted, Dallas Semiconductor shares dropped $1.19 to $36.88.

By Tom Jacobs  Reuters reports that soft drink giant Coca-Cola Co. (NYSE: KO) has offered $16 billion for Quaker Oats Co. (NYSE: OAT), eyeing its powerful Gatorade brand sports drink. Coke's offer tops PepsiCo's (NYSE: PEP) $14.8 billion proposed purchase, which Quaker rebuffed earlier this month.  Coke is believed to be offering 1.9 shares per Quaker share, or about $116.70. France's Groupe Danone (NYSE: DA) has reportedly made an offer as well, and the Quaker board is probably prepared to hear from PepsiCo again -- or even another possible suitor, such as Nestle.  Coke is currently trying to regain investor confidence after shaky times. The deal would give Coke a lock on the sport drink market, which Quaker's Gatorade currently dominates with an 84% market share, compared to 11% held by Coke's PowerAde and 3.1% for PepsiCo's All-Sport. Industry analysts note that the non-carbonated beverage market is growing faster than the bubbly kind, and Gatorade is the solid-gold brand. The appeal of the Gatorade label explains why other suitors may appear once they know Gatorade's in play. But any buyer would have to deal with Quaker's cereal business, and there's only so much you can do with oats after you toast them or sugar them up in breakfast bars.  Any deal for Quaker would join a gaggle of recent food world acquisitions: Philip Morris (NYSE: MO) purchased Nabisco Holdings (NYSE: NGH) in June; Unilever -- Anglo-Dutch parent of Unilever PLC (NYSE: UL) and Unilever N.V. (NYSE: UN) -- acquired Bestfoods Oct. 5; and Keebler Foods Co. (NYSE: KBL) combined with Kellogg Co. (NYSE: K) on Oct. 26.  Coke closed Friday at $61.83, down $0.50, while Quaker finished off $0.19 to $90.31, just shy of its 52-week high of $92. Quaker has jumped 13% since its suitors appeared, while Coke stock currently sells for 1997 prices. _________________________________________________________________  NEWS TO GO  Agilent Technologies (NYSE: A) is selling its medical products business to Dutch electronics whiz Philips Electronics for $1.7 billion, capping Philips' two-year, $4 billion buying spree in the industry. The deal leaves Philips the number three medical equipment maker, behind General Electric (NYSE: GE) and Siemens. This is an interesting move for Agilent, which apparently views its dragging medical equipment business separately from its booming life science manufacturing biz, growing through partnerships with such biotechs as Caliper Technologies (Nasdaq: CALP) and Rosetta Inpharmatics (Nasdaq: RSTA).  Programmable logic company Xilinx (Nasdaq: XLNX) won its seven-year-old patent infringement suit Friday against competitor Altera (Nasdaq: ALTR) and said it would seek an immediate injunction against the loser. Back atcha, Altera promised an immediate appeal of the jury verdict. Altera sought to minimize the damage, asserting that the verdict covers only Flex 8000 product sales, representing just 2%, or $30 million, of its annual revenues. Xilinx is a favorite of telecom guru George Gilder.  Alas, still darker days for Sunbeam (NYSE: SOC). The Securities and Exchange Commission has recommended enforcement action against the company and individual officers -- including former Chairman and CEO ""Chainsaw"" Al Dunlap -- for alleged accounting irregularities that created a sunny picture of actual cloudy days for the camping goods and appliance manufacturer. Sunbeam limped home Friday to $0.68.  Online auto dealer Autoweb.com (Nasdaq: AWEB) is laying off 25% of its staff in an effort to save $10 million a year and become profitable. The company's difficulty in attracting buyers to online car showrooms joins priceline.com's (Nasdaq: PCLN) similar woes. Autoweb's chart since its March 1999 IPO is an emblem for the dot-com debacle.

I'm attaching a list that I  prepared that generally has the items that are outstanding; however, the  priority items are the back up information on performance testing (& curves)  of the inlet fogging system and the peaking testing (output) of the three  units and the confirmation of the data in table 5 (long term performance of  the projects). I have the O&M contracts, the monthly reports, and the contracts between OEC  and Caldwell for the inlet fogging system, but these do not contain what  Conrad (RW Beck) is looking for. My understanding from the operations guys is  that there is data for the above items. As discussed, Conrad will be here Monday morning, so if we could have the  back up information for these items by then, it would expedite the process  tremendously. You can reach me at 54426 if you have any questions. Thanks for your help. Joana   ",benjamin.rogers@enron.com,joana.bekerman@enron.com,99 Peakers,2000-11-20 04:24:00-08:00,received

By Rick Aristotle Munarriz  If there were truth in ticker symbols, Agilent (NYSE: A) would be holding up its ""A"" report card proudly. With quarterly estimates pegged at $0.53 a share, the electronics testing equipment maker powered up expectations with a $0.69-a-share showing.  That was a 77% surge in bottom-line growth before charges on $3.4 billion in revenues for the September period. That's welcome news for a company that has seen its shares fall sharply since peaking at $162 back in March.  However, a slowdown in microchip testing equipment as well as weakness in the wireless market has the company warning of slower growth ahead. With a healthy backlog of orders, Agilent still expects to meet estimates of $0.45 for the current quarter.  Spun off by Hewlett-Packard (NYSE: HWP) last year, Agilent will be deploying new capital into areas where it sees higher growth: communications and life sciences. I guess that gives the company an ""A"" for effort too. _________________________________________________________________  NEWS TO GO  Chipped off the old block, semiconductor distributor Avnet (NYSE: AVT) announced that earnings for the current quarter would come in between a nickel to a dime below the $0.85-a-share forecast. While acknowledging the cyclical ways of the chip industry, the company believes that earnings for the rest of the year will remain on track.  Attention holiday shoppers, Nieman Marcus (NYSE: NMG.A) reported stronger-than-expected profits but warned of slow action at the registers so far this month. That's critical as the upscale department store chain heads into the important buying season. Nobody wants to see the Grinch steal Christmas (well, OK, it did top the box office this past weekend, but that's another story).  EDGAR Hoovered? The Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) site for electronic financial filing and data retrieval will go down on Friday for a ""major upgrade."" The Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval system -- thankfully better known as EDGAR -- will be back up on Monday morning. http://www.lnksrv.com/m.asp?i=205554  Has Ozzy Osbourne bitten off more than he can chew -- again? The legendary showman is suing Hughes Electronics (NYSE: GMH) and MCY.com (Nasdaq: MCYC) for broadcasting an Ozzfest 2000 concert tour stop to Hughes' DirecTV subscribers. Osbourne claims that tour sponsor MCY.com only had rights to a Web cast of the rock event. Mr. Crowley will not be his legal counsel.  Deere (NYSE: DE) John? An epic Novell (Nasdaq: NOVL)?

Who's next in line?  By LouAnn Lofton  First it was PepsiCo (NYSE: PEP). Then it was Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO). Now it looks like it's the French food company Groupe Danone (NYSE: DA). What am I talking about? The latest bidder for cereal company and Gatorade-owner Quaker Oats (NYSE: OAT), of course.  Talks between Coke and Quaker are over. Coke's board of directors met yesterday to discuss the potential $15.75 billion stock acquisition of Quaker. Coca-Cola wanted Quaker for the same reason that Pepsi did -- the Gatorade sports drink. Gatorade controls about 80% of the sports drink market, with Coke's Powerade coming in second. Coke would have been saddled, though, with those parts of Quaker's business that make up the majority of its revenues and are growing the slowest -- its cereal and oatmeal operations.  It's likely that several factors led to the decision by Coke's board not to proceed with the Quaker acquisition. First, with value guru Warren Buffett as a director, you better believe that the price Coke was going to pay for Quaker was a very important consideration. Coke's shares had been driven down 10% since the potential deal was announced Monday, as many thought Coke would be paying too much for Quaker.  Another factor that likely caused the board to reject the acquisition was the potential for antitrust hang-ups with the deal, given that Coke's sports drink Powerade controls the largest part of the market after Gatorade. A third contributing factor was probably one of focus. Coke refocused itself on its core beverages business in the late 1980s, and buying Quaker -- with its Cap'n Crunch and Rice-A-Roni, among other brands -- would have moved it beyond the beverage business once again. The company doesn't appear to want to take that route.  So, Pepsi's out, Coke's out, and already, another company has announced that it's pulling a chair up to the bidding table. Danone issued a statement confirming that it is considering a bid for Quaker. The bottled water, dairy products, and biscuits company wants to develop its business to become ""a world leader in focused, growth oriented, healthy nutrition and beverage business."" Perhaps Quaker can help it get there. _________________________________________________________________  NEWS TO GO  NTT DoCoMo, a subsidiary of Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation (NYSE: NTT), is rumored to be interested in buying a 20% stake in AT&T Wireless (NYSE: AWE). The investment would be about $9 billion. A deal like this would give DoCoMo a presence in the strong U.S. wireless communications market. Currently, AT&T Wireless is a tracking stock of AT&T (NYSE: T). Once AT&T splits into four separate businesses, AT&T Wireless will become an independent company.  Software company Novell (Nasdaq: NOVL) announced fourth-quarter and fiscal year-end earnings yesterday. Sales in the fourth quarter fell 21% to $273 million from last year's $344.5 million. A decline in sales of the company's packaged software to small businesses impacted results. On a diluted per share basis, Novell broke even in the fourth quarter, matching analysts' expectations. It earned $0.17 a share in the fourth quarter last year. For the fiscal year, net income dropped to $49 million, or $0.15 a diluted share, compared to $191 million, or $0.55 per share the year before.  CacheFlow (Nasdaq: CFLO) reported second-quarter results yesterday. The company, which makes technology that improves the flow of content over the Internet, lost $0.09 a share on a pro forma basis. Analysts had expected a loss of $0.11 a share. CacheFlow's revenues grew to $32.55 million from last year's $22.45 million. This sales increase of 45% was below the 55% increase expected by some analysts, and shares traded down after-hours despite the company's smaller-than-expected loss.  The president of fashion designer and retailer Liz Claiborne (NYSE: LIZ) resigned. Denise V. Seegal, whose last day is December 8, has been president of Liz Claiborne since 1996. Liz Claiborne's Chairman and CEO Paul Charron said that there are no plans to replace her, and that he'll be taking over her duties. Charron said, ""We had different approaches. I wanted to get closer to the managers running the business units.""

Enjoy!  -- What causes mortgage rates to rise and fall?  -- A. They fluctuate along with other interest rates. Interest rates are affected chiefly by inflation and the market for debt (notes, bills, and bonds, among other instruments). With inflation extremely low in recent years, we've enjoyed low interest rates. But if signs of inflation begin to pop up, it's expected that the Federal Reserve, led by Alan Greenspan, will hike up short-term interest rates via an adjustment in the rate of interest on ""federal funds."" The ""fed funds"" rate is the rate of interest a bank can charge another bank for use of its excess money. The Fed can also change the ""discount rate,"" or the rate paid by a bank to borrow short-term funds from the Fed. The prime rate and other rates (such as mortgage rates) are based primarily on these two interest rates.  The Fed raises these interest rates when the economy appears to be growing too briskly, which can spur inflation. When the economy is sluggish, it might cut these rates in order to give American enterprise a boost. Lower rates give companies and people (including house-shoppers) an incentive to borrow money. However, remember that the money markets themselves (basic supply and demand for money at each price point) exert the biggest influence over interest rates, though the Fed is a big influence on market expectations.  -- Q. Where online can I access earnings reports that companies file with the SEC?  -- A. Many Web sites, such as ours, include access to these filings in their stock data offerings. But you can also go right to the source at sec.gov or freeEdgar.com. http://www.lnksrv.com/m.asp?i=3D207898 http://www.lnksrv.com/m.asp?i=3D207899  Got some questions of your own for the Fool? Head to our Help area or post your question on the Ask a Foolish Question discussion board. http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=3D207900 http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=3D207901  _________________________________________________________________   INVESTING BASICS - GATHERING COMPANY INFORMATION  You're intrigued by Wookie Cookies Inc. (ticker: CHEWY) and being a good Foolish investor, you want to research it. Simply give the firm a jingle and ask the investor relations department to send you an investor information package. (They're free!) Tell them you'd like to receive the most recent annual report, the latest 10-K and 10-Q reports, any recent press releases, and any available analyst reports. Alternatively, you can save a few trees by gathering the information immediately online at freeEdgar.com. http://www.lnksrv.com/m.asp?i=3D207902  The annual report will probably feature glossy photos of smiling customers (or assorted alien life forms) chomping on cookies. But look to the back of the report where the numbers will tell you the real story about the business. There are three main financial statements there. The income statement shows the company's sales and profits. The balance sheet lists assets and liabilities, such as cash, inventories and debt. The statement of cash flows reveals where cash is coming from and going to.  These statements also appear in the 10-Q and 10-K reports. The 10-K is issued once a year, along with the annual report, and 10-Qs are issued thrice a year, at the end of the intervening quarters. The 10-Q summarizes quarterly performance, while the 10-K features a lengthy discussion of the firm's operations and challenges.  Financial statements reveal how quickly sales are growing, how the company is financing its growth, how much profit it's making, and much more. Pay attention to trends, to see if the firm's financial health is improving or declining. Compare the company with its industry peers, to see how it stacks up.  Remember that you can improve your chances for success if you're actually a consumer of Wookie Cookies and are familiar with the company's offerings. Also, talk about the business with other investors, perhaps in an investment club.  Don't neglect online resources. Most company Web sites feature an investor information section, with press releases, financial statements, annual reports, and answers to frequently-asked questions. Investor information sites like ours at fool.com also offer a wealth of information on companies and communities of investors sharing information. http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=3D207903 _________________________________________________________________  IN THE SPOTLIGHT  -- Fool writers reveal how they go about researching companies. http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=3D207904  -- Look up the best interest rates for mortgages, car loans, and bank accounts. http://www.lnksrv.com/m.asp?i=3D207905  -- Struggling with credit card debt?

By Tom Jacobs  Computer behemoth Hewlett-Packard (NYSE: HWP) settled German copyright test case litigation Thursday. The company agreed to pay GEMA, Germany's top licensing entity, $1.54 for each compact disc (CD) burner sold since February 1998 and $5.16 for each future sale. A CD burner allows illegal copying of music off the Web and onto a personal CD. Industry experts estimate that $500 million is lost annually to CD pirating, with a total of 25 million pirated music files available online. Hewlett-Packard closed at $35.56 Friday, up 5.57% and 10% above its 52-week low of $32.63.  GEMA sued Hewlett-Packard in May because it's the German market leader in CD burners. GEMA initially sought up to $12.90 per CD burner, now often available for under $200. Hewlett-Packard spokesperson Jeannette Weisschuh wouldn't estimate the cost to the company, but she noted that foreign online retailers would gain an advantage by selling cheaper CD burners -- without having to pay the fees. ""This was a trial to send an example for the whole market,"" she said. ""It's unfair to the consumers who have to pay more and unfair to the manufactures because it gives us a competitive disadvantage.""  Most countries have agencies similar to GEMA (the U.S. has ASCAP and BMI, for example), which collect license fees and pay them to copyright owners through recording houses and music distributors. Pre-digital-age copyright laws zapped makers of equipment such as tape recorders and video players that could be used to violate copyright laws, but now those laws have been expanded into a world of CD burners, computer printers, hard drives, and high-speed modems.  With music industry estimates of $5 billion a year lost through bootlegging, other countries' licensing bodies are likely watching Germany and making their own plans. Last Friday, Rex Moore (TMF Orangeblood) covered developments in the U.S. with online music file-sharing company Napster, now in cahoots with -- get this -- German's media giant Bertelsmann. http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=212088 _________________________________________________________________  NEWS TO GO  General Electric (NYSE: GE) ended speculation this morning by naming Jeffrey R. Immelt, currently president and CEO of GE Medical Systems, to succeed CEO Jack Welch when he retires at the end of 2001. Effective immediately, Immelt is GE's president and chairman-elect, and will serve on the GE board of directors and join Mr. Welch and Vice Chairmen Dennis D. Dammerman and Robert C. Wright as a member of the corporate executive office.  E-tailer Amazon.com's (Nasdaq: AMZN) website was down for 30 minutes the Friday after Thanksgiving, traditionally the busiest shopping day of the year. Amazon spokesman Bill Curry said, ""It was totally internal, it was a bug in the system that is now exterminated. It had nothing to do with holiday traffic."" The system was back up by 9:30 am.  After denying a possible merger with Gemstar-TV Guide (Nasdaq: GMST) last Tuesday, bookseller Barnes & Noble (NYSE: BKS) spokesperson Mary Ellen Keating on Friday would not rule it out, saying that talks between the two companies spanned a wide range of options. http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=212089  Troubled cable and telecom giant AT&T (NYSE: T) stated it will purchase no more equipment for cable upgrades from Antec Corp. (Nasdaq: ANTC) or CommScope Inc. (NYSE: CTV) before next year. The two companies' shares plummeted more than 20 % Friday on the news. Shares of Scientific-Atlanta Inc. (NYSE: SFA), C-Cor.net Corp. (Nasdaq: CCBL), and Harmonic (Nasdaq: HLIT), which also sell cable TV equipment to AT&T, dropped on news they stopped shipments. AT&T is Harmonic's biggest customer, and its shares trade near a 52-week low due to continued losses and investor concerns over AT&T's health.  Bloomberg reports that Morgan Stanley Dean Witter (NYSE: MWD) has abandoned plans to buy Japan's Nippon Global Securities, and instead will pursue its own retail offices in Japan. Many international banks and brokerage firms have targeted Japan, where most married households -- traditionally through the wives -- maintained their savings in low or negative interest Post Office accounts. Financial market liberalization -- the so-called Big Bang -- has allowed foreign companies recently to attack the Japanese securities market, known for requiring years of building personal relationships to achieve business success. _________________________________________________________________  EDITORS' PICK  David Gardner expounds on the virtues of making your own investment decisions -- not just mimicking the Fool's. http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=212090 _______________________________________________________________  -News & Commentary  http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=212091  -Fool Community  http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=212092  -Post of the Day  http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=212093  -Latest Fribble  http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=212094  -Latest Market Numbers  http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=212095 ____________________________________________________________  My Portfolio: http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=212096 My Discussion Boards: http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=212097 My Fool: http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=212098 Fool.com Home: http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=212099 My E-Mail Settings: http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=212100    Sponsored By: Mercedes C Class  The New C from Mercedes-Benz.

FREE REPORT reveals details:  http://www.lnksrv.com/m.asp?i=214563   ""Bankruptcy is a legal proceeding in which you put your money in your pants pocket and give your coat to your creditors."" -- Joey Adams   BASSETT HOUNDS The furniture specialist barks -- and it bites.  By Rick Aristotle Munarriz  Bad news is like sandpaper -- it can wear you down until you're dull and finished. Bassett Furniture (Nasdaq: BSET) becomes the latest home furnishings specialist to send out pink slips and warn of reupholstered financials. Earlier this month, Furniture.com discontinued operations. http://www.lnksrv.com/m.asp?i=214564  However, unlike Furniture.com's inability to secure financing to subsidize losses, Bassett remains profitable despite trying times in the furniture industry. Higher oil prices make shipping bulky pieces as costly as it is cumbersome. Even worse, rising interest rates have slowed the housing market to a crawl. Without new homes to stock up with new furniture, the industry becomes as attractive as that hideous barcolounger collecting dust in your attic. The soft demand now finds Bassett expecting fourth-quarter earnings per share to come in as much as a dime below the $0.42 consensus estimate.  To offset the cyclical weakness, the company also announced a consolidation of its domestic wood manufacturing operations. Ultimately, 280 workers will be displaced. However, the wood chuck won't disrupt the company's modest growth plans. The company is still on track to open 52-65 new Bassett Furniture Direct and At Home retail stores a year over the long term.  Bassett also won't reduce its dividend. That's welcome news to yield investors who are drawn to the $0.20 quarterly dividend. The company's hefty payout -- a 6.8% yield based on yesterday's close -- will keep the stock from falling too far down.  Selling at just 8-9 times this year's freshly revised earnings and with savings looking to beef up the bottom line in years ahead, maybe Bassett isn't howling at the moon. Lowering costs in domestic production in the face of cheaper Asian imports is a painful yet necessary step. Like the company itself, the move will pay nice dividends when housewarming gifts once again line the porches of suburbia. _________________________________________________________________  NEWS TO GO  High fiber? Communications infrastructure heavyweight Dycom (NYSE: DY) reported better-than-expected earnings on a 46% spurt in profits. The $0.51-a-share showing was seven cents ahead of analyst estimates. Total contract revenue climbed by 32% for the quarter. Dycom also named President and CEO Steven Nielsen as its Chairman, succeeding the retired Thomas Pledger. Nielsen will wear all three hats. He will also preside over the company's acquisition of privately held Point to Point Communications.  Is it Kevorkian or Kerkorian? Billionaire investor Kirk Kerkorian, DaimlerChrysler's (NYSE: DCX) fifth-largest shareholder, is suing the car maker for $9 billion. Kerkorian is all revved up over his claim that the 1998 merger between Daimler Benz and Chrysler was sold to him as a marriage of equals. In his view, the European Mercedes Benz parent is clearly in the driver's seat now. He'd rather play shotgun than ride shotgun. According to Kerkorian, it was deception that caused him to submit his 14% stake in Chrysler in favor of the union.  The good, the bad, and the Covad (Nasdaq: COVD). The struggling DSL provider has announced layoffs and will be scaling back its marketing and network expansion costs. The expense reductions should amount to 20-30% in annual savings beyond the onetime charge, but that alone won't vault the company to profitability. Many of the high-speed connection purveyors have had to temper their expectations in recent months. Earlier, Covad had to restate third-quarter results when it was having trouble collecting from deadbeat cash-strapped ISP customers.  Like country, like company.

By LouAnn Lofton  Broadband networking equipment maker ADC (Nasdaq: ADCT) reported fourth-quarter and fiscal year-end results yesterday after the market's close. Strong broadband connectivity sales led to net income growth (excluding charges) of 94%, beating estimates.  ADC's sales for the fourth quarter were $1.03 billion, ahead of last year's $634 million by 63%. Pro forma operating income increased 121% to $206 million, from $93 million. Pro forma net income for the quarter was $138 million versus the year-ago $71 million. On a per-share basis, ADC earned $0.18. Analysts as polled by First Call/Thompson Financial expected $0.17 a share.  ADC's broadband connectivity sales grew 102% compared to last year. The company's international sales increased 63% to $227 million. North America and Europe continue to be ADC's largest sales regions.  Looking ahead to the next fiscal year, ADC expects full-year earnings per share to be between $0.68 and $0.70, which is in-line with current estimates. The company sees its sales for the year coming in between $4.15 billion and $4.30 billion. ADC does expect first-quarter earnings to come in shy of current estimates by a penny. The company pointed to seasonal trends as the reason for this.  ADC's chairman and CEO, William J. Cadogan, said of the results, ""We were firing on all cylinders as each of our three major business groups and international hit all-time high sales in the quarter. Our outstanding employees were key contributors in ADC surpassing the significant milestone of one billion dollars in sales for the first time in a quarter."" News to Go _________________________________________________________________  NEWS TO GO  Argentinians won't be getting any more Wendy's (NYSE: WEN) Spicy Chicken Sandwiches starting soon. The fast-food company said yesterday that it is immediately closing all 18 of its restaurants in Argentina. They've been unprofitable for more than a year. The company will take a onetime charge in the fourth quarter of between $17 million and $22 million, or $0.08-0.11 a share. CEO Jack Schuessler said, ""The economic and competitive conditions we faced in Argentina were just too difficult to overcome, despite the efforts of our management team and a dedicated crew at the stores.""  Internet consulting company iXL (Nasdaq: IIXL) said on Tuesday that it will lay off 850 employees and close seven offices. iXL cut 350 jobs back in September. The latest round of job cuts represent about 35% of iXL's staff. iXL will take a charge in the fourth quarter for the restructuring, and expects to be profitable by early 2001. The company has about 300 clients, and says it plans to start focusing heavily on its top 75 clients. Bill Getch, an iXL spokesman, said, ""Our larger clients, they want deeper engagements.... But they're taking much more time to select and contract a lot of that work. So the sales cycle has extended. If you've built a large infrastructure and the sales cycle has lengthened... then you either increase the pipeline fast enough to sustain that infrastructure or you reduce that infrastructure.""  Pork processor Smithfield Foods (NYSE: SFD) reported second-quarter earnings yesterday. The company's net income doubled to $44.6 million, or $0.81 a share, from last year's $22.2 million, or $0.48 a share. Smithfield, therefore, beat the consensus estimate of $0.77 a share. The company's results were driven by live hog prices that were 20% higher in the second quarter than they were in the previous second quarter. Sales increased to $1.4 billion from $1.2 billion in the year-ago period.  BFGoodrich (NYSE: GR) is selling its performance materials division to an investor group for $1.4 billion, the company said today. This completes BFGoodrich's move from a tire and chemical company to an industrial products and aerospace company. BFGoodrich will get $1.2 billion in cash and $200 million in debt securities for the business. Possible uses for the proceeds from the sale are debt repayment, acquisitions, and share repurchases, according to the company.

Enjoy!  -- Q.  What do you think of viaticals as investments?  -- A. Viatical settlements have grown in popularity in recent years. But they're not without risk and they may make some people uncomfortable.  Viatical settlements are when a terminally ill person sells his or her life insurance policy to someone else. Imagine John, stricken with a fatal form of cancer. He's 36 and is expected to live only three more years. If he needs cash to pay for medical bills or just to spend and enjoy, he might sell his life insurance policy to Jane. If it's set to pay $100,000 on his death, Jane might pay $66,000 for it. That way he gets a lot of cash now and Jane expects to get the $100,000 in about three years. At that rate, she'd be earning roughly a 15 percent annual return.  There are many risks, though. John may hang on for seven years, significantly reducing Jane's return. Indeed, a cure for his cancer might be discovered. John may even outlive Jane! It's true that these settlements can provide a service for sick people, but they're not necessarily win-win. The middlemen arranging these settlements take cuts. Also, if John lives, he's without his life insurance policy and few insurers will want to insure him, as he's been so sick recently.  We're uneasy about investing in something that has us rooting for speedy deaths and against medical breakthroughs. Also, there have been many instances of fraud with viaticals.  -- Q. What does ""shrinkage"" mean in the business world?  -- A. It refers to the loss of inventory that happens through usual ways, such as accidental breakage, theft, weather damage, etc.  Got some questions of your own for the Fool?

Let us help.  First, understand that the income statement summarizes sales and profits over a period of time. It might cover three months or a year, for example. It will usually offer information for the year-ago period as well, so you can compare the two and spot trends.  Here's a slightly dated but nevertheless interesting example. Let's look at Eskimo Pie Corp.'s income statement for fiscal year 1998. At the top, as with every income statement, you'll find net sales (sometimes called revenues). For Eskimo Pie, they're $63.5 million.  From now on, as we work down the income statement, various costs will be subtracted from the revenues, leaving different levels of profit. The item you'll find just under revenues is ""cost of goods sold"" (abbreviated as COGS and sometimes called cost of sales), which represents the cost of producing the products or services sold. For Eskimo Pie it's $37.4 million. Subtract the COGS from revenues, and you'll get a gross profit of $26.1 million.  To find the gross profit margin, simply divide the gross profit by revenues. $26.1 million divided by $63.5 million yields a gross margin of 41 percent. (Compare results with industry peers. For example, at a similar time, gross margin was 35 percent for Ben & Jerry's, which has a somewhat different business model.)  Next, the remaining costs involved in operating the business, such as support staff salaries, utility bills and advertising expenses, are subtracted, leaving the operating profit. Eskimo Pie's operating profit is $1.8 million. Divide this by revenues, and you get a slim operating margin of 2.8 percent. This reveals the profitability of the company's principal business. (Ben & Jerry's: 4.3 percent.)  Finally, after items such as taxes and interest payments are accounted for, we come to net income, near the bottom of the statement. Eskimo Pie's is $0.8 million. Divide that by revenues and you get a net profit margin of 1.3 percent. (Ben & Jerry's: 3 percent.) The last part of the income statement is where the company divides its net income by shares outstanding, to arrive at earnings per share (EPS).

By Chris Rugaber  Storage network infrastructure company Brocade Communications (Nasdaq: BRCD) reported a fourfold increase in revenues after yesterday's market close, and beat analysts' earnings estimates, but the company's shares declined in after-hours trading anyway.  Sales for the company's fiscal fourth quarter, which ended October 28, rocketed upward to $132.1 million, from $30.1 million in the year-earlier period. Net income increased to $27.2 million, from only $3.9 million a year ago. Earnings per share jumped to $0.22, from last year's $0.03 per share, ahead of consensus estimates of $0.20 per share. The company also announced a 2-for-1 stock split that will take effect on December 22, its third split since it became a public company in May 1999.  Brocade makes switches and other equipment for data storage networks, and has rapidly increased its market share, from about 30% a year ago to almost 60% today. The company's stock has grown almost as quickly, up about 75% for the year as of yesterday's close. The shares have declined in recent weeks, along with several other data storage companies, due to concerns over valuation, slowing economic growth, and increasing competition in the data storage market.  Nevertheless, Brocade is quite bullish about its future. The company projects revenue will grow 150% to $830 million in fiscal 2001, and that gross margins will remain at 60%. The company's CEO, Greg Reyes, noted that ""We just happen to be serving a market segment that is one of the fastest-growing market segments on the face of the planet and what I think will emerge as the next major networking category.""  Despite the positive results, the company's shares, which fell 4.5% yesterday in advance of the earnings report, traded down further in after-hours activity, as investors become increasingly nervous about richly valued technology stocks. As one analyst told Reuters, ""I would think [the stock price] would go up, but oh well.... The market environment we are in is not normal.''

Now the company not only forecasts a disappointing fourth quarter but upcoming year as well. FULL STORY>>> http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=220745 _________________________________________________________________  NEWS TO GO  Telecom giants AT&T (NYSE: T) and NTT DoCoMo officially announced their widely rumored partnership today, with the Japanese mobile communications services provider agreeing to purchase 16% of AT&T Wireless (NYSE: AWE) for $9.8 billion. AT&T Wireless, currently a tracking stock, will receive $6.2 billion and AT&T will receive $3.6 billion in cash. The purchase values AT&T Wireless at $23.50 per share, a 31% premium over yesterday's closing price. DoCoMo, which means ""everywhere"" in Japanese, has been taking minority stakes in wireless service providers around the world as part of its strategy to extend its services internationally. The two companies also announced that AT&T Wireless would form a wholly owned subsidiary to develop mobile data and multimedia services similar to DoCoMo's wildly successful i-mode service. AT&T Wireless, the third-largest wireless service provider in the U.S., also said it would introduce third-generation (3G) data services in 2002, using the same W-CDMA standard that DoCoMo is planning to use. http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=220746  Leading local phone company Verizon (NYSE: VZ) yesterday announced that it has canceled plans to buy a majority stake in floundering DSL provider NorthPoint Communications (Nasdaq: NPNT), after NorthPoint restated third-quarter financial results on November 20, lowering sales by about 20%. Like its fellow DSL provider Covad Communications (Nasdaq: COVD), which also reduced previously announced sales earlier this month, NorthPoint blamed the restatement on non-payment from financially strapped customers. Nevertheless, Verizon believes it can terminate the deal as a result of the changes in NorthPoint's business and financial condition. NorthPoint's CEO said that she may seek ""legal remedies.""  Struggling retailer Gap (NYSE: GPS) fell in after-hours trading upon reporting a 1% same-store sales drop for the month of November, thanks largely to declines in its Banana Republic and Old Navy stores. The company also said that it is ""cautious"" in its outlook about next quarter's sales and earnings. Gap's earnings have fallen for the past two quarters.  Programmable computer chip maker Altera (Nasdaq: ALTR) yesterday warned for the second time this month that revenues would slow in upcoming quarters, causing the company's shares to fall sharply in after-hours trading. The company said in a conference call that sales for the fiscal fourth quarter would be flat sequentially, and that first-quarter 2001 sales would increase less than 5%, down from an 84% revenue increase in the third quarter. Overall, the company estimates that revenues for fiscal 2001 will grow 35%, below current estimates for 49% growth for the year. The company blamed inventory buildup at contract manufacturers for the slowdown. ""November was an awful month,"" said CEO Rodney Smith. _________________________________________________________________  EDITORS' PICK  We're trying to find out if a company's past performance is always a good litmus test when considering it as an addition to your portfolio. http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=220747 _______________________________________________________________  -News & Commentary  http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=220748  -Fool Community  http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=220749  -Post of the Day  http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=220750  -Latest Fribble  http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=220751  -Latest Market Numbers  http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=220752 ____________________________________________________________  My Portfolio: http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=220753 My Discussion Boards: http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=220754 My Fool: http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=220755 Fool.com Home: http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=220756 My E-Mail Settings: http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=220757    Sponsored By: Scottrade  Scottrade: $7 Trades, 120+ offices, personal brokers, FREE  REAL TIME Quotes & charts.

That's where the fruit is."" --Mark Twain   PEPSI COURTING QUAKER, AGAIN Quaker Oats and Pepsi are talking once more, but will the outcome be the same?  By Mike Trigg  The Quaker Oats (NYSE: OAT) story took another spin yesterday, when the world's second-largest soft drink company, PepsiCo (NYSE: PEP), resumed talks to purchase the maker of Gatorade for $14.3 billion. Not long ago, similar discussions were brought to a halt after Quaker rejected Pepsi's offer, citing a dispute in price.  The story with Quaker is an interesting one. After similar talks with Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO) and French food conglomerate Groupe Danone (NSYE: DA) failed to materialize, investors are left to ask: Is this time for real? http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=3D223139  According to The Wall Street Journal, the two sides appear close to agreement, with the deal potentially wrapping up in the next couple of days. If the two sides in fact do reach agreement, an announcement would be made Monday morning. Both companies have planned board meetings for this Saturday. http://www.lnksrv.com/m.asp?i=3D223140  Apparently, the proposed deal is no different than the last. Quaker Oats shareholders would receive 2.3 shares of Pepsi stock, valued at $104.36, based on Pepsi's closing price of $43.38 yesterday. That's a 27% premium to Quaker Oats=01, stock price as of November 2, the day original talks were made public. Pepsi hasn't offered a ""collar"" -- the original deal breaker -- to Quaker, which is a form of price protection that fixes a price within a set limit of how far the buyer's shares can rise or fall. The same Wall Street Journal article reports that an arrangement is being negotiated that would allow Quaker to abandon the deal if the value provided to Quaker shareholders became less than $90 per share upon closing.  If the deal does go through this time around Pepsi would surpass Coca-Cola as the leader in the non-carbonated U.S drinks market, holding nearly one-third of the market, compared to Coca-Cola's 21%. According to the Street, Pepsi would also be able to jump start sales of Quaker Chewy Granola bars, selling them through its Frito-Lay food division. _________________________________________________________________  NEWS TO GO  Information transfer device maker Crossroads Systems (Nasdaq: CRDS) announced better-than-expected third-quarter results after the market's close yesterday, reporting a net loss (excluding goodwill and stock compensation) of $4.8 million, or $0.18 per share, compared to a loss of $870,000, or $0.04 per share, in the year-ago period. The Street consensus called for the company to lose $0.21 per share. Crossroads=01, top line came in at $8.4 million, an 18% increase year-over-year.  Discount airline company Cheap Tickets (Nasdaq: CTIX) announced that CFO Dale Jorgensen plans on retiring in February. Jorgenson will remain with the company after his retirement to aid in the transition and provide assistance on certain projects. ``While my time with Cheap Tickets has been very rewarding, I have decided to devote more time to my family and other personal interests. I am very pleased to have been part of the progress the company has made moving into the public market and see a great future for Cheap Tickets' unique multi-channel revenue and distribution model,'' said Jorgensen.  Carbon dioxide seller Kinder Morgan Energy Partners (NYSE: KMP) announced a deal with GATX Corp. (NYSE: GMT) to purchase two oil product pipelines and 12 storage terminals for $1.15 billion in cash and debt. Kinder Morgan Partners Chairman and CEO Richard Kinder estimated the deal would increase earnings per share between $1.62 and $1.75 in 2001, with the Street consensus calling for the company to earn between $1.50 and $1.62 a share in the coming year. The deal is expected to close in the first quarter of next year.  Heating and cooling products provider Modine Manufacturing (Nasdaq: MODI) announced that it was revising earnings and sales forecasts for its third quarter and the full fiscal year (ends March 31, 2001). The Racine, Wisconsin-based company expects third-quarter revenue to be down 10% to 13% and earnings 55% to 65%. For the full year, sales should be down 7% to 10% with earnings dropping between 25% and 30%. The company cited a weak euro and lower sales in the heavy-truck and light-vehicle markets. Modine earned $2.20 per share in the previous year.  Steel processing company Worthington Industries (NYSE: WOR) announced that its second-quarter (ended yesterday) earnings would fall short of expectations and that it had halted its proposed $300 million acquisition of three Pennsylvania limited partnerships: MetalTech, NexTech, and GalvTech. The company said earnings would be substantially lower than the $0.15 per share it posted in the previous quarter and that the full-year Street earnings expectation of $1.07 was unrealistic. The Street consensus called for the company to earn $0.22 per share in the second quarter. The company cited the weakness in several of its business, including its steel-processed products operations. _________________________________________________________________  EDITORS' PICK  Gene Logic CEO Mark Gessler talks about the fascinating things the company will be able to accomplish via human-genome mining. http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=3D223141 _______________________________________________________________  -News & Commentary  http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=3D223142  -Fool Community  http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=3D223143  -Post of the Day  http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=3D223144  -Latest Fribble  http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=3D223145  -Latest Market Numbers  http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=3D223146 ____________________________________________________________  My Portfolio: http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=3D223147 My Discussion Boards: http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=3D223148 My Fool: http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=3D223149 Fool.com Home: http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=3D223150 My E-Mail Settings: http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=3D223151    Sponsored By: BUYandHOLD  Hey Fool!

By Tom Jacobs  Ending weeks of maneuvering and speculation, PepsiCo (NYSE: PEP) has agreed to buy Quaker Oats (NYSE: OAT) for $13.4 billion in stock. Pepsi matched its deal of one month ago of 2.3 shares per Quaker share, valuing Quaker at $97.46 per share, based on Pepsi's Friday close at $42.38. Quaker ended Friday at $88.63.  The deal follows weeks of machinations that began with a rejected Pepsi bid for Quaker, followed by interest from Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO) and France's Groupe Danone (NYSE: DA) -- reportedly at a price more than $14 billion. With the departure of Coke and Groupe Danone from negotiations, attention returned to Pepsi,whose original lower offer now looked darn good to almost-left-at-the-altar Quaker. http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=225166 http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=225167  The pact creates a food and beverage powerhouse with $25 billion in revenues and an expected $80 billion market cap. The deal gives Pepsi three key advantages: 1) Pepsi swigs Quaker Oats' Gatorade sports drink, which is tops in its market and carries a huge distribution and warehouse system that Pepsi hopes will increase efficiency and reach for its Tropicana brand; 2) Quaker's fruit, oatmeal, and granola bar and other snack products will spice Pepsi's Frito-Lay and other snack foods; 3) highly profitable Quaker brands such as Quaker Oatmeal, Life and Cap'n Crunch Cereals, Rice-A-Roni (""the San Francisco treat!""), and Aunt Jemima syrup provide hefty free cash flow.  Pepsi's CEO and Chairman Robert Enrico had planned to retire, and will now speed up his move. Current President Steve Reinemund will become CEO, and Enrico will remain on the board as vice chairman. Quaker's CEO Robert Morrison, credited with Quaker's turnaround, committed to stay on for 18 months and will join Enrico on the board as a vice chairman. Indra Nooyi, Pepsi's CFO, becomes president, increasing the ranks of big-company top-level women executives.  The fianc,s agreed to two price conditions: If Pepsi stock drops under $40 for 10 days in the month before closing, valuing Quaker at $92 a share, Quaker may walk unless Pepsi commits to $92 a share. On the flip side, Pepsi pays no more than $105 a share, even if its stock climbs over $45.65 a share. Pepsi will issue 315 million shares to pay for the purchase, which the parties expect to be completed in the first half of 2001 -- depending on antitrust scrutiny. _________________________________________________________________  NEWS TO GO  Bloomberg reports the network storage giant EMC (NYSE: EMC) will introduce a product, code-named Chameleon, to compete against Network Appliance (Nasdaq: NTAP) in the small to medium-size business market for network attached storage (NAS). EMC already competes in the market for large corporation NAS, and holds 30% of the overall NAS market compared to Network Appliance's 40%, according to information technology market researcher IDC. IDC estimates that the NAS market will reach $7 billion by 2003. EMC closed Friday at $78.25, off a 52-week high of $103.94, while Network Appliance finished at $53.94, from a 52-week top of $152.75.  Barron's reported in its December 4 edition that eBay (Nasdaq: EBAY) was in talks to buy uBid, a unit of CMGI (Nasdaq: CMGI). Reuters reported that an eBay source denied the story, though eBay declined official comment. According to Barron's, UBid plans to pop the champagne this week on a new consumer-to-consumer auction site, Auction Exchange, to compete with eBay. UBid has 1.5 million registered users, and its current online auction site sells mostly refurbished and closed-out consumer electronics.  Bad news keeps copying at Xerox (NYSE: XRX). After Moody downgraded Xerox debt to junk-bond status on Friday, the company announced it would lay off 200 production workers -- the first time in more than a year that the company has fired union workers. The laid-off employees must work until December 22 but will receive pay and benefits through January 26. This action follows November's decision to pink-slip 350 white-collar U.S. workers, and both are separate from last March's decision to lay off 5,200 workers by April 2001. Xerox shares closed Friday at $6.25, down 56.3 cents, or 8%.  Swiss drug giant Novartis (NYSE: NVS) announced positive Phase II results from its developmental leukemia drug, Glivec. Leukemia involves uncontrolled proliferation of white blood cells. Glivec selectively targets a key protein involved in leukemia, and Novartis hopes the drug will be used instead of painful bone marrow transplants or more toxic alpha interferon treatment. Significant response rates varied according to the disease stage, and ranged from 33% to 78%, with 30% showing normal blood counts. Glivec is still several years from the pharmacy shelves because it faces larger Phase III studies and application to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for marketing approval. _________________________________________________________________  EDITORS' PICK  Todd Lebor provides investors a list of sources for information on the wireless industry, along with his assessment of each one's credibility. http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=225168 _______________________________________________________________  -News & Commentary  http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=225169  -Fool Community  http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=225170  -Post of the Day  http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=225171  -Latest Fribble  http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=225172  -Latest Market Numbers  http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=225173 ____________________________________________________________  My Portfolio: http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=225174 My Discussion Boards: http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=225175 My Fool: http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=225176 Fool.com Home: http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=225177 My E-Mail Settings: http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=225178    Sponsored By: InvestorPlace.com  A billion Chinese are clamoring to get on the Internet.

"1.  What are the short term NOx and CO emissions during startups, and are there limitations during start-ups.  Normally, there is a short period during startup when the NOx goes to  approximately 35 ppm.  This is very short in duration and occurs while the  gas turbine is loading.  Our site is permitted to normally operate between  70-100% turbine load.  These emissions have subsided within the few minutes  required to attain 70% load.  Our permit constraints require that we do not  exceed our emissions limits on a 3 hour rolling avarage.  Therefore these  short-term startup emissions are not an issue.    CO is a calculated value.  I do not have short-term CO2 numbers at present.   However, I don't believe they are at issue since they are related to excess  air which is pretty high during startup.  There is a condition called lean-lean firing which can and has occured from  time to time.  A transition takes place above 40MW when the nozzle gas  arrangement normally goes to a firing state called ""premix steady state.""  If  this transition fails for some reason, the machine goes into a lean-lean  state and the NOx level can rise to 40-50 ppm.  The turbine activates and  operator alarm when this happens.  We can count the number of occurances that  this has happened on one hand at Caledonia.  When this conditions occurs, the  operators correct the condition by reducing the load to about 35MW and then  increase the load again.  Typically this resolves the faulty transition and  it configures the nozzles correctly on the second attempt.    2.  Are industrial stormwater permits required at either site?  No industrial stormwater permit is required at Caledonia.    3.  In Caledonia, what is the custom fuel sampling schedule?  The fuel sampling schedule for both sulphur content and heating value at  Caledonia is once per month.

By Rick Aristotle Munarriz  There was a time when 3Com (Nasdaq: COMS) networking equipment and U.S. Robotics modems meant techie heaven. That time has long since gone. Citing a shortage of parts and a slowdown in orders from telco carriers, the company warned that third-quarter results would come in softer than expected.  3Com is now projecting revenues for the period to come in between $765 million and $780 million -- more than $100 million below analyst estimates. A loss of $0.19 to $0.23 a share is also nearly three times as wide as Wall Street's forecast for an $0.08 deficit.  3Com had already begun to fade away from the investing community radar. Once the company completed its spin-off of personal desktop assistant maker Palm (Nasdaq: PALM) back in July, growth investors had little reason to stick around. Standard & Poor's felt the same way. It ditched the company in favor of its Palm sprout for its S&P 500 Index.  While there are no guarantees, shareholders might take solace in knowing that 3Com remains cash-rich. With $2.7 billion in cash and short-term investments, the company is stacked with $7.75 a share in greenbacks. In theory that should help limit the downside not much farther below the $9.50 the stock was fetching in after-hours trading yesterday. But even that may prove to be knobby-kneed shelter if losses continue to widen. However, 3Com believes that the carrier orders have simply been put on hold -- not hung up on the receiver. Shareholders better hope that 3Com is making the right call this time. _________________________________________________________________  NEWS TO GO  A slowdown in orders will also be taking a toll on Xilinx (Nasdaq: XLNX) this quarter. The specialty chip maker warned that it too would be reporting revenues short of analyst expectations. Like its rival Altera (Nasdaq: ALTR), who had warned just last week, an inventory backlog will not be a painless fix.  It's time to pay for play at MP3.com (Nasdaq: MPPP). The popular digital music site has now unveiled a ""Premier Service"" upgrade to its existing My.MP3.com listening solution. For $49.95 a year, users can beam up to 500 CDs to their account and stream as many as 300 songs in a row without interruption. While the free service never capped the allowable discs, it did have to be restarted after playing every 50 selections. So much for the free music revolution -- though the free basic My.MP3.com service seems set to continue. http://www.lnksrv.com/m.asp?i=227743 http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=227744  Finland's Nokia (NYSE: NOK) should give the wireless sector a roaming charge this morning after the top dog announced that it expects revenues to grow in the 25-35% range through at least 2003. Nokia controls nearly a third of the global wireless handset market.  While weakness in online advertising is certainly not news anymore, industry leader DoubleClick (Nasdaq: DCLK) confirmed the malaise by sending out pink slips yesterday. The layoffs are minor relative to other realignment sackings -- less than 10% of its workforce -- but it does confirm the hard times in the realm of Internet marketing. Brother, can you spare a banner ad click?  The thong throng? According to Bloomberg.com, News Corp. (NYSE: NWS) and Disney (NYSE: DIS) have received European Council approval to team up with Brazil's Globosat Programadora for a joint venture in the latter's home turf. So an Australian media giant teams up with a stateside titan and a local behemoth to produce Brazilian television programming -- and Europe nods? It's a small world after all. _________________________________________________________________  EDITORS' PICK  Paul Commins wants you to understand why the Rule Breaker's knickers aren't in a knot every time the market is down. http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=227745 _______________________________________________________________  -News & Commentary  http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=227746  -Fool Community  http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=227747  -Post of the Day  http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=227748  -Latest Fribble  http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=227749  -Latest Market Numbers  http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=227750 ____________________________________________________________  My Portfolio: http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=227751 My Discussion Boards: http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=227752 My Fool: http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=227753 Fool.com Home: http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=227754 My E-Mail Settings: http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=227755    Sponsored By: Scottrade  Open an account at Scottrade.com! $7 Trades, 120+ offices,  personal brokers, FREE REAL TIME Quotes & live charts.

"Ben:  I am not sure that Swati from Duke understands what the payment schedule  represents.  First of all, the property tax payments for assessment years  2000 - 2009 range from a high of $590K to $490K and are not close to the  numbers he feels are reflected by the schedule.    Property tax payments for any given assessment year in Mississippi are paid  in January of the year following the year of assessment.  For example, the  property taxes for the 2000 year assessment year are paid in January 2001 and  the payment schedule reflects that ($591,200).  The other figure that shows  in the column are property taxes for that year to be paid in the following  year.  The 15% ratio of assessment has been taken into account in the calculation  and the payments for the year are total estimated taxes for the year  including the payment-in-lieu-of taxes payment (""PILOT"").  The document for the PILOT agreement has been supplied to the Duke Property  Tax Department.  Have Swati contact Kelly Voelkel for any information he  needs.

By LouAnn Lofton  Comverse Technology (Nasdaq: CMVT) reported third-quarter earnings yesterday after the bell. The company, which makes systems and software for telecommunications, had an increase in revenues of 37% and net income growth of 52% when compared to the third quarter last year.  Comverse's sales improved to $317.97 million versus $232.89 million in the year-ago period. Comverse earned $68.41 million, excluding one-time charges for acquisitions, up from last year's $44.96 million. The company beat the consensus estimate according to First Call by two cents with earnings per share of $0.38. Comverse had earnings per share in last year's third quarter of $0.28.  In the third quarter, Comverse acquired Exalink and Gaya Software. The company took an after-tax charge of $4 million for costs related to the purchases of those businesses.  Comverse improved gross margins to 62.6% from 61.4% in last year's third quarter. The company also increased its net margins from 19.3% to 21.5%.  Driving the results for Comverse was strong demand for the company's products from wireless providers. A majority of Comverse's sales are to wireless network operators.   AFTER-HOURS COVERAGE  WORMS IN APPLE'S HOLIDAY QUARTER By John Del Vecchio and Dave Marino-Nachison With Gateway warning of a poor start to the holiday season less than a week ago, there was definitely reason to figure that Apple wouldn't be far behind in warning about near-term profits. But in its most-recent quarter, Apple was the victim of its own poor execution. How low can this cash-rich company's shares go?

Greenspan remarked on the fact that technology advancements have given the country nearly unprecedented ability to gain efficiency -- but many players in the high-tech market got to the game too late. Should the economy slow too much, the Fed may just drop rates next year. For now, though, the tightening bias is a thing of the past. FULL STORY>> http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=230062 _________________________________________________________________  NEWS TO GO  Home Depot (NYSE: HD) and 3M (NYSE: MM) have new chiefs and they're both from General Electric (NYSE: GE). Home Depot named Robert L. Nardelli its new president and CEO effective immediately. 3M picked W. James McNerney Jr. as the company's new chairman and CEO. Nardelli had been president and CEO of GE Power Systems, and McNerney was head of GE Aircraft Engines. Both men were being considered as replacements for GE's chairman Jack Welsh, but were passed over in favor of fellow GE-er Jeffrey Immelt.  Car parts retailer AutoZone (NYSE: AZO) reported a drop in first-quarter earnings yesterday. The company's net income was $53.8 million, down from last year's $56 million. Sales grew 6% to $1.06 billion. Buoyed by share repurchases, AutoZone increased earnings per share to $0.46 from the year-ago period's $0.40. The company blamed the net income shortfall on ""a difficult sales environment.""  Data storage company EMC (NYSE: EMC) said this morning that it expects fourth-quarter earnings to increase by at least 55% over last year's Q4 results. The company also thinks revenues will grow to $12 billion in 2001. CEO Michael Ruettgers said in an interview with Reuters that his company is ""very comfortable"" with the current 2001 revenue projections, which are almost double the company's 1999 levels.  Lante Group (Nasdaq: LNTE), an Internet consulting business, is cutting its staff by 19%. This translates to about 120 jobs, and the closure of the company's Singapore and Delhi offices. After the cut-backs, Lante will have around 500 employees. Lante hopes to save around $4 million with the reductions, starting in the first quarter of 2001. The company is trying to become ""cash break-even"" during the first half of 2001. Lante's president and CEO, Rudy Puryear, said, ""We did not react as quickly as we should have to the speed and magnitude of this dramatically changing environment. As a result, we are disappointed with our recent financial results. Moreover, the decision to reduce our workforce was very difficult, but necessary. We are implementing several steps to reposition the business to grow revenue and achieve profitability in the coming year."" _________________________________________________________________  EDITORS' PICK  Despite the recent volatility, aspects of the storage industry are growing quickly. http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=230063 _______________________________________________________________  -News & Commentary  http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=230064  -Fool Community  http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=230065  -Post of the Day  http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=230066  -Latest Fribble  http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=230067  -Latest Market Numbers  http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=230068 ____________________________________________________________  My Portfolio: http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=230069 My Discussion Boards: http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=230070 My Fool: http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=230071 Fool.com Home: http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=230072 My E-Mail Settings: http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=230073    Sponsored By: BUYandHOLD  Hey Fool!

Enjoy!  -- Q. What does it mean when a company is said to be ""stuffing the channel""? A company I was interested in has been accused of this.  -- A. When a company stuffs the channel, it ships inventory ahead of schedule, filling its distribution channels with more product than is needed. Since companies often record sales as soon as they ship products, channel stuffing can make it appear that business is booming. In reality, the products not sold may well be returned to the manufacturer. This means sales already claimed may never occur. In a sense, sales from past quarters are made at the expense of sales in future quarters.  See if accounts receivable growth is outpacing sales growth. If so, that's a red flag. Alternatively, calculate ""days sales outstanding"" (DSO). First, divide the last four quarters' revenues by 365. Then divide accounts receivable by that number. This reveals how many days' worth of sales the current accounts receivable represents. Between 30 and 45 days is typical. You can also follow the same process for the last quarter, dividing last quarter's revenues by 91.25 (days in a quarter, on average).  A company with a low DSO is getting its cash back quicker and, ideally, putting it immediately to use, getting an edge on the competition. Rising numbers can signify channel stuffing. Remember this isn't useful for all companies. Restaurants and cash-based businesses, for example, aren't going to have much, if any, receivables.  -- Q. What's a holding company?  -- A. Holding companies own the securities of other firms. They usually maintain voting control of these companies, as well. A good example is Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway, which owns GEICO, See's candy and Dexter shoes.  Got some questions of your own for the Fool?

What are the short term NOx and CO emissions during startups, and are there limitations during start-ups.  Start-up emissions vary and can not accurately be measured due to the  inherent delay time in the CEMS system.  Additionally, start-up emissions are  not required to be and in fact were not measured during the stack testing.   There are no limitations on emissions during start-up evolutions, since the  permits at both plants allow exceptions to exceedences during start-ups and  shutdowns.  Short term NOx emissions due to start ups are as follows:  Unit #1 = 78.95 ppmc Unit #2 = 79.49 ppmc Unit #3 = 87.58 ppmc Unit #4 = 89.48 ppmc  TDEC Operating Permit #950748F special condition #5 requires that Brownsville  Power 1 L.L.C. (BPI) operate at 0.057 #/MMBtu and 0.090 #/MMBtu for units  #1-2 and #3-4 respectively, with a total NOx emission limit of 249 Total Tons  per Year.  The TDEC Division of Air Pollution Control regulation chapter  1200-3-20-.02 (1) regulates the reasonable measures required to keep emission  to a minimum during startups, shutdowns and malfuntions.  There is no Special  Condition outling rolling averages or compliance with a certain time limit  for NOx emissions otherthan ""Reasonable Measures Required.""  2.  Are industrial stormwater permits required at either site?  Brownsville Power was issued a Tennesse Multi-Sector General Permit (TMGP)  #TNR05XXX for Storm Water Discharges associated with Industrial Activity. Mr.  Jacke Wade, TDEC Division of Water Pollution stated that if the NOV's were  not satisfied after July 1, 2000 a new TDEC rule was being promulgated to  convert the TMGP back into a Storm Water permit during construction.  I  believe the NOV's have been satisified and can therefore request TDEC to  terminate the TMGP.  Due to BPI's sic code of 4911, it is my understanding  that we are not required to maintain an Industrial storm water permit or  SPDES permit.    Caledonia  3.  In Caledonia, what is the custom fuel sampling schedule?  The fuel monitoring schedule has been monthly from Comercial Operation 6-7-00  through 4-00.  Then in accordance with the TDEC letter dated 9-10-99  Brownsville Power was granted a custom fuel monitoring schedule.  The  schedule consists of sulfur monitoring conducted twice monthly for six  months; then sulfur monitoring conducted once per quarter for six quarters;if  fuel analyses show little variability the samples will be conducted twice  annually during the first and third quarters of each calendar year.  Brownsville  4.  What is the agency's response to the Enron letter regarding the 2nd stormwater NOV?  I spoke with Mr. Jacke Wade on 6-14-00 and requested he visit the site to  inspect the work completed.  His response was "" I will inspect the facility  as time permits and if I do not show up on your door step your o.k.""  I have  not heard from him to date.  5.  Has there been any further action by the agency since the 1st stormwater NOV was never responded to?  Not to my knowledge other than issuance of the 2nd NOV dated 5-1-00.  6.  One memo stated that the stormwater is channeled to a wetland.  Was that during construction only or is it ongoing?  I do not recall specifically wetland being mentioned, but the TDEC letter  dated 2-22-99 and 5-1-00 refers to the ""sediment retention basin"".  In my  internal memo to Mitch Robinson dated 9-14-00 I outlined the corrective  measures which included the excavation of the holding pond (sediment  retention pond) and build a spillway for sediment retention.  7.  Were there any further problems with the B T Readymix concrete dumping issue?            ",benjamin.rogers@enron.com,don.miller@enron.com,Re: Question 2,2000-12-06 05:39:00-08:00,received

By Chris Rugaber  Bank of America (NYSE: BAC) lowered its earnings guidance for the fourth quarter yesterday, due to increased write-offs of bad loans. The company also announced that it would not renew $20 billion in corporate loans over the next two years. It is the second time in the past month that the company has reduced its fourth-quarter profit projections.  The Charlotte, North Carolina-based bank now expects fourth-quarter profits of about $1.4 billion, or $0.85 to $0.90 per share, down from last year's $1.23 per share and below estimates of $1.17. As recently as September, estimates for the fourth quarter were $1.35 per share. Earnings projections were also reduced for next year, from $5.46 to $5.10 per share. The company plans to write off between $1.1 billion and $1.2 billion in bad debt this quarter, almost triple the third quarter's total of $435 million. Bank of America's shares fell about 10% yesterday, and other bank stocks declined as well, including Citigroup (NYSE: C), Chase Manhattan (NYSE: CMB), First Union (NYSE: FTU), and Bank One (NYSE: ONE).  Last month, the company indicated that a loan of $500 million -- widely believed to be held by the Sunbeam Corporation (NYSE: SOC) -- is ""nonperforming,"" meaning it is not paying interest. In addition, Bank of America holds loans to companies such as Owens Corning (NYSE: OWC), which filed for bankruptcy October 5 as a result of asbestos litigation, and ICG Communications (Nasdaq: ICGXQ), which filed for bankruptcy on November 14. The company also lent to Regal Cinemas, which defaulted on its bank debt last month and is considering filing for bankruptcy.  Bank of America seems to have a negative outlook at this point. ""We're pessimistic about the economy, we're pessimistic about the capital markets and the ability of companies to refinance, and it's very easy for companies to throw in the towel,'' said Chief Financial Officer James Hance at an investors' conference yesterday. ""We're taking a very conservative outlook.''  Part of that conservative outlook was announced later yesterday when the company said it would not renew about $20 billion in loans over the next two years. CFO Hance noted that ""We are not interested in renting out our balance sheet to clients who are not delivering us additional fee-based business."" The move comes after Federal Reserve Chair Alan Greenspan urged banks on Tuesday not to overly tighten their credit standards. _________________________________________________________________  NEWS TO GO  Motorola (NYSE: MOT) greeted investors this morning with an earnings warning, stating that it will not meet earlier revenue and earnings guidance. The company blamed delays in cost-cutting measures in its personal communications segment and ""slowing market conditions"" for its semiconductor products. Motorola now expects fourth-quarter sales of $10 billion and earnings per share of $0.15, down from earlier guidance of $10.5 billion and $0.27, respectively. In a press release the company stated that it ""continues to expect robust growth in the global wireless telephone market, with unit sales in the range of 525-575 million in 2001, up from an estimated 420 million units this year, and expects to fully participate in that growth."" The company announced additional manufacturing outsourcing yesterday. http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=232133  Hasbro (NYSE: HAS) may soon be a has-been (sorry). The company warned last night that it will at best break even this year, and may post a loss of $0.10 to $0.20 per share, thanks to slowing sales, particularly in trading-card games. Hasbro also said it will sell its Hasbro Interactive and Games.com divisions to French company Infogrames Entertainment for $100 million in cash and stock. The company was expected to earn $0.43 per share this year, and pulled in $1.42 per share last year.  Internet-commerce consultant Scient (Nasdaq: SCNT) announced last night that its fiscal third-quarter earnings would come in below expectations, and that it would cut 460 jobs. The company cited slowing spending among its clients -- which included AT&T (NYSE: T) and Chase Manhattan (NYSE: CMB) -- on Web services and growing competition from management consulting firms as the culprits.  The world's fifth-largest media company, News Corp. (NYSE: NWS), said that it has initiated a hiring freeze in order to control costs as advertising revenue growth slows. President Peter Chernin said he expects the U.S. ad market to be ""tough"" over the next couple of quarters. Yesterday, other news organizations such as Dow Jones Inc. (NYSE: DJ) and Knight-Ridder (NYSE: KRI) also cited slowing ad sales as a reason behind their negative announcements. Dow Jones reduced earnings projections for its fourth quarter, while Knight Ridder said it would lay off as much as 2% of its workforce. _________________________________________________________________  EDITORS' PICK  What do Warren Buffett and a wine critic have in common?

The Multi-Sector General Permit was issued for construction in lieu of Storm  Water Permit by TDEC direction on August 7, 1998 If by July 1, 2000 the construction activities were not complete, BPI would  have had to transfer the TMGP to a new Storm Water Permit for Construction  that was promulgated this summer.    The soil erosion control & countermeasures taken and completed by BPI on  June 15, 2000 has completely satisfied TDEC  concerns outlined in the NOV's  dated 2-28-99 and 5-1-00.   Mr. Wade asked my opinion of vegetative  stablization, which was the last condition by TDEC before allowing BPI to  terminate the construction permit,  I responded that, in my opinion, the  stablization throughout the facility was excellent.   I have attached a ""Draft"" letter to TDEC requesting the termination of the  TMGP.  Please review and comment at your earliest convenience.

He only makes progress when he sticks his neck out."" --James Bryant Conant   QUESTIONS LEFT FOR ASK JEEVES TO ANSWER The Internet search engine issued a waning yesterday, proving it doesn't have all the answers.  By Mike Trigg  Internet know-it-all Ask Jeeves (Nasdaq: ASKJ), the provider of a search engine that answers all our questions, issued an earnings warning after the market's close yesterday. The company attributed the shortfall to a slowing economy and reluctance among companies to make additional outlays on online advertisements. What's more, CEO Rob Wrubel also stepped down.  The Emeryville, California-based company, which makes money through advertising and licensing, expects revenues of $25 million for the fourth quarter, about $10 million, or 30%, less than the Street was expecting. Ask Jeeves also expects to post a pro forma net loss of $18 million, or $0.50 per share, well below the Street consensus of a $0.33-per-share loss. In the previous quarter, the company posted a smaller-than-expected loss of $12.6 million, or $0.36 per share.  ""The broad-based economic slowdown has caused weakness in the online advertising market, advertising pricing pressure, and a decreased sense of urgency among Fortune 1000 companies to implement their online initiatives,"" President Adam Klein said. ""Amongst this and other factors, we have experienced weaker-than-anticipated demand for our solutions, however our relationships with existing customers remain strong.""  In other news, after more than two years on the job, CEO Rob Wrubel will be stepping down from his board and CEO positions, and assuming the role of executive vice president of market development. (The Motley Fool interviewed Rubel back in December.) Current board member George Battle will assume the CEO position on an interim basis, while the company looks for a replacement. http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=234495  After becoming a Street favorite, even receiving Motley Fool Daily Double recognition, and hitting its 52-week high of $144, the stock was punished along with the rest of the e-commerce sector at the beginning of the year. The recent shortfall shouldn't come as a complete shock. Advertising makes up a great deal of the company's revenues and, with the dot-com demise, demand for online advertising has diminished. Even Rule Maker Yahoo! (Nasdaq: YHOO) has been hurt this year, in part, over similar concerns. http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=234496 http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=234497  Despite the unfortunate news, the company still remains optimistic. Regarding 2001 revenue and earnings guidance, the company for once wasn't giving all the answers, saying that it was reviewing growth targets. Nevertheless, Ask Jeeves maintains it has enough cash in the ""engine"" to keep answering questions until reaching expected profitability in the fourth quarter of 2001. Whether that's the case will be the biggest question left for the company to answer. _________________________________________________________________  NEWS TO GO  Not long ago, a 23-year-old former employee of Internet Wire produced a phony press release, falsely reporting that the CEO of Emulex (Nasdaq: EMLX) had resigned, the company was restating earnings, and there was a pending investigation by the SEC. The hoax resulted in Emulex shares tumbling nearly 60% in one day. It appears the maker of computer cards that increase data transmission has moved beyond all that, announcing an agreement to acquire closely held computer-networking company Giganet for $645 million in stock. Emulex announced that it would issue about 4 million shares and assumed options for Giganet. The price was based on yesterday's closing price for Emulex shares, $155.75. While not expected to reduce per-share profits for the fiscal year (ending July 1), upon completing the acquisition, the company plans on taking a non-cash charge of $10 million.  According to a statement published on the Standard & Poor's website, copyright protection solutions provider Macrovision (Nasdaq: MVSN) will be added to the Standard & Poor's MidCap 400 Index after the market's close on December 8. It will replace energy services holding company LG&E Energy Corp. (NYSE: LGE).  Microwave telecommunications products maker California Amplifier (Nasdaq: CAMP) issued a fourth-quarter earnings warning and reported third-quarter results. The company expects earnings of $0.08 or $0.09 per share and revenues between $29 million and $31 million in the fourth quarter. The Street consensus estimate called for the company to earn $0.17 per share. Moreover, California Amplifier also reported third-quarter earnings of $2.29 million, or $0.16 a share, meeting the Streets expectations. Sales climbed to $32.6 million compared to $26.3 million in the same period last year.  Computer products seller CDW Computer Centers Inc. (Nasdaq: CDWC) announced in a press release that it expects earnings between $0.40 per share and $0.42 per share in the fourth quarter. That's below the Street consensus expectation of $0.50 per share. The company also expects revenue to be between $990 million and $1.1 billion, representing year-over-year sales growth between 34% and 36%. ""Currently, we are facing slower-than-expected demand due to economic uncertainties, which we believe is an industry-wide phenomenon,"" CEO Michael Krasny said in a statement. ""These economic uncertainties make us cautious about 2001, when we believe CDW will continue to increase market share, but grow sales at lower rates than recent quarters.""  Maker of liquid crystal displays for mobile phones Three-Five Systems Inc. (NYSE: TFS) announced that it expects a fourth-quarter profit between $0.08 and $0.10 per share, well below earlier profit guidance of $0.19 to $0.20 per share. The Street consensus expectation called for the company to earn $0.20 per share. The company also informed investors that it was expecting sales between $36 million and $38 million. It had been expecting $45 million in revenues. Commenting on the coming year, President and CEO Jack L. Saltich remarked, ""Our guidance for 2001 remains unchanged. On a relative basis, sequential revenue growth in the first quarter is expected, and that growth should be in the range of 8% to 10%."" _________________________________________________________________  EDITORS' PICK  Author and scholar Kevin Hassett talks to the Gardners about why he thinks stocks are a great buy now, and why Dow 36,000 could be on the horizon. http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=234498 _______________________________________________________________  -News & Commentary  http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=234499  -Fool Community  http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=234500  -Post of the Day  http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=234501  -Latest Fribble  http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=234502  -Latest Market Numbers  http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=234503 ____________________________________________________________  My Portfolio: http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=234504 My Discussion Boards: http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=234505 My Fool: http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=234506 Fool.com Home: http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=234507 My E-Mail Settings: http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=234508    Sponsored By: MUTUALS.com  Get a FREE portfolio analysis and recommendation.

VERY AND VERY. Intel's transistors will be three atoms thick.  By Tom Jacobs  Chip giants IBM (NYSE: IBM) and Intel (Nasdaq: INTC) both announced breakthrough chip technologies. IBM has started using a new manufacturing technology, while Intel promises transistors as small as three atoms thick, making chips almost seven times faster than its recently released Pentium 4.  IBM's new manufacturing technique, named CMOS-9S, showcases advances in copper wiring, silicon-on-insulator transistors, and better insulation so that chip circuits can be as small as 0.13 microns -- 800 times thinner than a human hair. IBM is making a variety of chips with this technique, and customers should receive their first shipments in early 2001.  But Intel now plans the world's smallest and fastest CMOS transistor. At 30 nanometers thick, the Santa Clara gorilla could fit 400 million of them on a chip, which is just shy of 10 times the number on a Pentium 4. Intel says that it will be possible to build chips by 2005 that run 10 billion operations a second, compared to the Pentium 4's 1.5 billion a second. Dr. Sunlin Chu, vice president and general manager of Intel's Technology and Manufacturing Group, said that new processors using the transistors not only would be smaller and faster, but use less power. He said, ""It's one thing to achieve a great technological breakthrough. It's another to have one that is practical and will change everyone's lives. With Intel's 30 nanometer transistor, we have both."" http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=3D237380  While industry observers believe that this advance approaches the limit on thickness, Jim Hardy, an analyst at Dataquest, says that ""This is proving there's no reason the normal growth of the semiconductor industry can't continue on for probably another 10 years."" If so, that's good news for Intel investors, who have endured recent Intel revenue warnings and stock price cliff-drops. Fools recently dueled over its future. http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=3D237381 http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=3D237382  Intel closed at $34.00 Friday, down from a 52-week high of $75.81, while IBM finished at $97.00, off its year high of $134.94. _________________________________________________________________  NEWS TO GO  U.K. drug maker Shire Pharmaceuticals Group PLC (Nasdaq: SHPGY) will buy Canadian biotech pharmaceutical company BioChem Pharma Inc. (Nasdaq: BCHE) for $4 billion in stock. Shire will pay $37 a BioChem share, a 40% premium over the company=01,s $26.50 Friday close. Shire looks to expand beyond its key niche in hyperactivity drugs, which comprise half of Shire's revenues but face increasing competition. Shire will pick up BioChem's successful Epivir AIDS treatment, marketed by Glaxo Wellcome (NYSE: GLX), but also BioChem=01,s Zeffix Hepatitis B treatment, which has been disappointing.  All eyes watch tomorrow's start of the U.S. wireless spectrum auction, with pessimists observing the big telecom lemming march over the cliff into Debt Sea. To improve its chances, AT&T Wireless (NYSE: AWE) has partnered with three Native Alaskan corporations so it can bid for ""closed"" frequencies set aside solely for small companies. Created in 1971 to settle Alaska natives' land claims, the corporations -- whose phenomenal success was portrayed popularly on TV=01,s Northern Exposure -- operate with little oversight and invest in natural resources, tourism, and other businesses in Alaska and throughout the lower 48 states. The companies, together with AT&T, paid $240 million to participate in the auction, 13% of the $1.8 billion paid for the chance to seek more licenses. Cingular Wireless and Verizon (NYSE: VZ) also partnered with small companies for the same reason. The FCC will auction 422 licenses in 195 markets, and estimates of the auction's take range from $10 billion to $18 billion.  Morgan Stanley Capital International, a division of Morgan Stanley Dean Witter (NYSE: MWD), said Sunday that it would change the weighting it gives companies in its benchmark indices. MSCI plans to weigh stocks in its indices according to market cap based on free float -- shares actually available for sale -- not total shares outstanding. This is expected to hurt companies that have a high percentage of shares owned by families, government, management, or other restricted company holdings. With an estimated $200 billion in sales and purchases expected when the indices change beginning November 30, 2001 and ending May 31, 2002, analysts expect U.S. and U.K companies to benefit, with Japanese, German, and French companies to suffer. MSCI will exclude any company whose free float is less than 15% of its total. http://www.lnksrv.com/m.asp?i=3D237383  Bloomberg reports that the Federal Government's Copyright Office, part of the Library of Congress, will publish a final executive branch administrative rule today requiring that U.S. radio stations pay royalties to record companies when the stations broadcast on the Internet. About 4,000 of 14,000 U.S. radio stations rebroadcast, or Web cast, on the Internet. Spokespersons for the National Association of Broadcasters decried the decision, which they say will add ""tens of millions of dollars"" to the already $300 million in fees paid to composers and publishers. Websites also assert that a related Copyright Office decision allows them to negotiate blanket licenses without having to negotiate with each record company, as can radio stations that have limited customer involvement but not individualized programming. The record industry disputes the distinction between consumer-influenced (""play my fave song"") versus individualized programming, and promises to fight. _________________________________________________________________  EDITORS' PICK  Zeke Ashton discusses the Rule Maker's low-turnover investment strategy, which minimizes year-end tax liabilities. http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=3D237384 _______________________________________________________________  -News & Commentary  http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=3D237385  -Fool Community  http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=3D237386  -Post of the Day  http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=3D237387  -Latest Fribble  http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=3D237388  -Latest Market Numbers  http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=3D237389 ____________________________________________________________  My Portfolio: http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=3D237390 My Discussion Boards: http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=3D237391 My Fool: http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=3D237392 Fool.com Home: http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=3D237393 My E-Mail Settings: http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=3D237394    Sponsored By: FOLIOfn  Investing in individual stocks but tired of trying  to guess winners?

The preliminary ecomonics tab looks at the dispatch spread  between coal and natural gas and the difference in variable O&M for coal and  natural gas plants.    If you need a model for a coal plant, I would suggest talking to the  Generation Investments group.  They are working on a deal where they are  buying some coal plants (the Allstrom Deal) and have created models for coal  plant ecomomics.  I believe Chuck Ward and Bill Keeney are spear-heading that  effort.     Please let me know if you have any questions about what I've sent you or if I  can help you with anything else.

Figures.  By Rick Aristotle Munarriz  It was simply a matter of when. DoubleClick (Nasdaq: DCLK), along with fellow online marketers Engage (Nasdaq: ENGA) and 24/7 Media (Nasdaq: TFSM), had already announced layoffs over the past few weeks. Clearly the once-hot Internet advertising niche had run ice-cold. Pink slips and economic booms rarely go hand-in-hand. http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=239420  So when DoubleClick set up a conference call yesterday after the market's close, it didn't take much of a guess to know what the company had to say. It wasn't even a matter of when anymore. DoubleClick lowered projections for both the December and January quarters.  Surprised? Not really. It's like pulling up to your house on your birthday to find a dozen cars parked on your front lawn and a chorus of hushes as you approach the door.  This surprise party might only startle the Rip Van Winkle who had last checked DoubleClick's pulse after its September quarter performance. The company had reported its first profit at the time and expected similar bottom-line results this quarter. Now fourth-quarter revenues are expected to come in between $126 million and $129 million -- well off the $140 million previously projected. Earnings will be breakeven at best.  A wider loss than expected will follow in March. However, DoubleClick still believes that 2001 will be a profitable year.  Surprised at the long-term stroke of optimism? You shouldn't be. True, nearly half of DoubleClick's revenues come from dot-com companies. In many cases, today's clients will line the corporate obituaries tomorrow as they struggle with cash burn rates in non-profitable enterprises that the market is no longer interested in subsidizing. However, one can't deny the lure of online marketing in the bricks-and-mortar world.  Internet usage is still growing by leaps and bounds. That is something that can't be said of traditional advertising channels such as print, television and billboards. The online medium also provides a more effective way to target an ad recipient. Probably even more important, in leaner economic times where ad budgets need to be justified, the success of an Internet marketing campaign can be effectively measured.  So, sure, these are dark times right now. But for investors willing to turn the key and step inside, bright lights, welcoming smiles, and wrapped gifts might be waiting on the other side. _________________________________________________________________  NEWS TO GO  Gamblers know to fold 'em when the chips are down. Well, gamblers, the chips are down. Dallas Semiconductor (NYSE: DS), Microchip Technology (Nasdaq: MCHP), and Advanced Micro Devices (NYSE: AMD) reported that quarterly results will come in below analyst estimates. The chipmakers are blaming a softness in sales for the shortcoming.  The same can't be said for General Electric (NYSE: GE) and Sonic (Nasdaq: SONC). Both companies reassured investors that earnings are on track. GE is comfortable with the year ahead. The burgermeisters at Sonic are comfortable with first-quarter estimates despite a slowdown in traffic at the drive-in units.  According to this morning's Washington Post, struggling Internet service provider PSINet (Nasdaq: PSIX) will be laying off 300 employees. Fittingly pronounced ""sigh Net,"" the struggling provider has seen its shares crash to under $2 from a high just above $60 a share back in March. Growing revenues at the expense of mounting losses just doesn't cut it nowadays.  Take a picture, it'll last longer. For the second time this quarter, Eastman Kodak (NYSE: EK) has had to reduce profit forecasts. The photography giant is now expecting full-year profits to come in lower than the year before. Hoping to shred the negatives, the company is embarking on a cost-cutting crusade that will reduce capital spending, SKUs, and inventory levels.

Of course, the bad people enjoy the waking hours much more."" -- Woody Allen   COMPAQ UNSURPRISINGLY WARNS Computer maker Compaq became a member of the warnings club yesterday.  By LouAnn Lofton  Compaq Computer (NYSE: CPQ) joined its PC-related brethren yesterday on the warning train. Gateway Computer (NYSE: GTW), Apple (Nasdaq: AAPL), Intel (Nasdaq: INTC), and Advanced Micro Devices (NYSE: AMD) have all warned the Street recently that sales and earnings in their fourth quarters would be below expectations.  Compaq lowered guidance for the fourth quarter and for its next fiscal year after the close of market yesterday. It also announced that it will take a non-cash charge in the fourth quarter related to the decline in value of some of its investments.  Compaq's revenues for the fourth quarter will now be between $11.2 billion and $11.4 billion. That's below the expected $12.3 billion, but still above last year's $10.4 billion. Compaq expects earnings, minus charges, to be in the range of $0.28-$0.30 a share. Analysts were looking for $0.36 a share. Compaq earned $0.19 a share last year.  The company blamed weak sales of its computers to U.S. consumers and businesses, and softness in the demand for its servers. Compaq is optimistic about the next fiscal year, but did lower its guidance for results.  Chairman and CEO Michael Capellas said, ""Our current 2001 plan calls for 10% revenue growth and 25% growth in earnings per share over the revised estimates for the fiscal year 2000. Although this is lower than our previous guidance, it still reflects strong year-over-year improvement."" According to First Call/Thompson Financial, analysts expected earnings to grow about 40% in the next fiscal year.  Compaq also said that it will take a non-operating, non-cash charge in the fourth quarter, related to the decline of some of its investments. Internet incubator CMGI (Nasdaq: CMGI) and its related assets are the main holdings that are causing this move. _________________________________________________________________  NEWS TO GO  Biotech company Amgen (Nasdaq: AMGN) announced share repurchase plans yesterday after the bell. The company plans to buy back up to $2 billion in common stock between January 1, 2001 and December 2002. Amgen also said that President and CEO Kevin Sharer will be adding chairman to his title. The current chairman, Gordon Binder, will retire December 31, as previously announced.  Retailer Claire's Stores (NYSE: CLE) will miss fourth-quarter earnings estimates. The company said yesterday that it sees earnings per share for the fourth quarter of between $0.70 and $0.80. Analysts had expected $1.12 a share. The company blamed slow sales for the disappointing results.  Embedded computer maker Radisys (Nasdaq: RSYS) warned yesterday that it will not meet current earnings and sales expectations. Radisys is looking for fourth-quarter revenue of around $83 million, versus the $90.7 million it originally predicted. Earnings per share for the fourth quarter will be between $0.20 and $0.24. Analysts, and the company itself, expected $0.41 a share. The company also said that the first quarter of its new fiscal year should return results about flat with the fourth-quarter results. Analysts had expected Radisys to have earnings per share in the first quarter of $0.42.  Internet consulting firm Razorfish (Nasdaq: RAZF) cut its fourth-quarter outlook yesterday. This is the second time the company has done so. Razorfish now expects to post a loss of between $0.17 and $0.22 a share for the quarter, excluding certain charges. Analysts were expecting a profit of $0.02 a share. _________________________________________________________________  EDITORS' PICK  Todd Lebor looks at the demise of eConsultant companies and leads us to wonder why obvious issues were ignored by management and investors alike. http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=241887 _______________________________________________________________  -News & Commentary  http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=241888  -Fool Community  http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=241889  -Post of the Day  http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=241890  -Latest Fribble  http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=241891  -Latest Market Numbers  http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=241892 ____________________________________________________________  My Portfolio: http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=241893 My Discussion Boards: http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=241894 My Fool: http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=241895 Fool.com Home: http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=241896 My E-Mail Settings: http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=241897    Sponsored By: NDB  A Special Offer for Motley Fool Members!

Enjoy!  -- Q. Tell me about this firm I've heard of, Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers. Does it underwrite initial public offerings (IPOs)?  -- A. It's one of the top venture capital firms, based in Silicon Valley. Its partners pool their money and invest in fledgling companies, specializing in computer-related technology and life sciences firms.  Venture capitalists typically enter the scene well before a company gets to the IPO stage. They pony up a lot of money to help the firm grow, usually in exchange for a large percentage of the company. They offer guidance, as well. The expectation is that once the company grows to a certain point, it will go public and the venture capitalists can cash out, making a very tidy profit.  Kleiner Perkins has funded many companies, such as Amazon.com and Netscape, in their infancy.  -- Q. What's a company's ""payout ratio""?  -- A. It's the percentage of net income the firm pays out to shareholders as a dividend. If Buzzy's Broccoli Beer (ticker: BROCB) pays $1.00 per year in dividends and earns $4.00 per share, its payout ratio is 25 percent.  This shows what the company is doing with its money. If much of its earnings are being returned to shareholders, then little is being reinvested in operations. That can be OK, as sometimes reinvested earnings would return less than shareholders could get investing the payout on their own.  Got some questions of your own for the Fool?

It's vital, though, to also evaluate the big picture, to make sure that the company you're looking at is a first-class operation and one you'd be proud to own in your portfolio. Here are some marks of great companies.  *Powerful brands.* Think of names well known in the United States, or better yet, around the world. Brands like McDonald's, Gucci, Campbell Soup, and IBM fit the bill. If most people don't yet know a company's name, then it still has a lot of work to do.  *Significant products or services.* Look for a company that's selling its customers something they really need or really want. Pharmaceutical companies, for example manufacture products that people will buy whether they're flush with funds or strapped. Firms like Ben & Jerry's and Starbucks offer consumers things they love. We often look for products that people buy over and over, like cheeseburgers and shampoo, instead of items bought only sporadically, like cars.  *Consistent, reliable earnings and sales growth -- and robust margins.* Track how sales and earnings have increased over past years. An upward-sloping line suggests that management is planning and executing well, encountering few surprises. Stack your company's gross, operating and net profit margins up against its competitors to see which one is wringing the most value out of each dollar of sales.  *Lots of potential.* See what the company's growth prospects are. Is it expanding abroad? Is it coming out with exciting new products or services? Are its offerings taking the country by storm? Is it trouncing its competition?  A final consideration when qualifying companies for further research is how well you know the company and industry, and how much you'd enjoy keeping up with its developments. A company might have enormous potential, but if reading about it puts you to sleep, it might not be the best addition to your portfolio. _________________________________________________________________  IN THE SPOTLIGHT  -- If you haven't jumped into some of our discussion boards,    you're doing yourself a disservice.

Companywide revenues improved 8.5% to $4.5 billion including international currency effects, which hurt results.  >>FULL STORY: http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=396292  ----------------------------------------------------------------- NEWS TO GO -----------------------------------------------------------------  Mutual fund company T. Rowe Price (Nasdaq: TROW) said first-quarter net income was $0.38 per share, down significantly from last year's $0.58 and missing Wall Street's consensus forecast by two pennies. Revenues fell to $280.5 million from $316.3 million a year ago as declining assets under management cut into the fees the company could collect.

A member of Entrust's board since 1997, Conner was chairman from October 1998 to May 2000.  Oil company Exxon Mobil (NYSE: XOM) said first-quarter net income, before items, was more than $5 billion at $1.44 per share, up from last year's $0.95. Wall Street's consensus estimate was $1.35 per share, but the company beat that handily because of high oil and gas prices. Revenue was $57.3 billion.  Irish drug company Elan (NYSE: ELN), profiled in a December feature by Zeke Ashton, said Q1 net income was $0.41 per share, up from last year's $0.24 and a penny better than estimates as sales improved 27% to $429 million. http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=396294  ----------------------------------------------------------------- HOT TOPICS ----------------------------------------------------------------- IMACS HELP SURVIVORS Apple Fools were quick to notice that the iMac was Survivor's computer of choice.

Brotherton  ----------------------------------------------------------------- TOP STORY -----------------------------------------------------------------  COMPAQ DOES NOT COMPUTE Hardware specialist Compaq (NYSE: CPQ) reported lackluster first-quarter results. Sales and operating profits of $9.2 billion and $200 million, respectively, declined during the period with Compaq falling short of analyst earnings estimates. Dell (Nasdaq: DELL) continued to eat away at the company's computing market share. Compaq also announced 2000 layoffs, on top of 5000 jobs that were slashed just last month.  >>FULL STORY: http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=396920  ----------------------------------------------------------------- NEWS TO GO -----------------------------------------------------------------  Call waiting? Third-generation (3G) cell phone services will be put on hold as Nippon Telegraph and Telephone (NYSE: NTT) subsidiary DoCoMo will be delaying its May 30 launch until October in order to fully test the network. Enabling faster rates of wireless data transmission, 3G is the key to revolutionary information services through your handset. Until then, it'll just be another space on the Battleship grid. http://www.lnksrv.com/m.asp?i=396921  The quest for success ends at Quest Diagnostics (NYSE: DGX). The lab diagnostics specialist reported that earnings more than doubled to $35.7 million -- or $0.74 a share. That was 11 cents higher than analyst expectations. The company sees 50% bottom-line growth this year on a modest 5-7% uptick in sales. In other words, the lab results are in and the prognosis on margin expansion looks pretty healthy.  Chips and dips. Novellus (Nasdaq: NVLS) reported an 8.7% slide in sequential income growth while still managing to quadruple profits. The microchip equipment maker announced that shipments fell by 13.5% during the quarter. The semi stocks continue to feel the hurt as the book-to-bill ratio -- the gauge for determining chip demand by pitting orders against actual shipments -- sank for the seventh consecutive month.  Once a data-munching beast, Informix (Nasdaq: IFMX) will now be selling its database unit to IBM (NYSE: IBM) for a billion in cash. The asset sale was reported along with first-quarter results, which fell both sequentially and year-over-year for the Massachusetts-based company.  So happy together, GlaxoSmithKline (NYSE: GSK) -- the result of the merger between Glaxo Pharmaceuticals and SmithKline Beecham -- reported its first quarterly financials since its union. Results came in ahead of expectations, and -- given merger cost savings -- GlaxoSmithKline is comfortable with its 13% earnings growth guidance for the full year.  ----------------------------------------------------------------- HOT TOPICS ----------------------------------------------------------------- SCAM ALERT ON EBAY After uncovering a loophole in eBay's bidding system, Fools look for solutions. http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=396922  NOKIA'S EARNINGS RELEASE Nokia's latest quarterly results were announced last week, and Fools are poring over the numbers. http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=396923  LUCENT, THE UNIVERSE, AND EVERYTHING A New York Times article prompts a discussion about the state of the telecom industry.

LESSON: Confronting Contradictory Advice   YOUR QUESTIONS ANSWERED  -- Q. What exactly are ""tech stocks"" -- computer makers?  -- A. Great question. The term often refers to computer companies and software makers. But these days, it can be hard to think of companies that don't employ a fair amount of technology.  Think of pharmaceutical firms, for instance. Drug chemistry and drug delivery processes involve technology. Golf club manufacturers apply technology to their new product development. Pretty much any airplane-related enterprise uses technology -- from building jets to booking flights. Likewise, Federal Express and other delivery specialists rely heavily on technology. Of course, some companies do so more than others. Sun Microsystems, for example, is much more of a technology company than Hershey.  When we hear that ""tech stocks were up today,"" we have to wonder what exactly is being said. A good way to think about the term might be to use it for companies that draw most of their revenue from directly using or creating technology.  -- Q. How bad a sign is it if a company's insiders are selling shares?  -- A. It's not necessarily bad at all. Many executives these days are compensated significantly with stock options. They may simply be generating cash to buy a house or put a kid through college. We wouldn't fret too much unless an awful lot of a company's top brass were selling shares -- and selling significant percentages of their holdings. Even that could be a coincidence, but it might warrant a little scrutiny on your part.   P.S. GOT AN INVESTING QUESTION FOR US?

You'll frequently run across seemingly contradictory advice, which will leave you scratching your head. The solution to this confusion is to understand that investing is both 1. simple and 2. complex.  At the beginning, it's simple. Your first steps should be to get out of debt, read broadly on investing, and perhaps invest your initial dollars in an index fund. But once you begin looking into picking individual stocks on your own, you may run into some contradictions. For example:  1. Don't waste your time trying to time the market. Always    remain invested in stocks. And 2. Don't be afraid to stay out of the market, at least    partially, for a while. Wait for the fat pitches.  Here's another pair:  1. Don't add money to a falling stock position. And 2. Dollar-cost average, investing regularly in a stock no matter    whether it's up or down.  There are many such dilemmas that frustrate new investors.  1. Buy and hold forever (or at least for a very long time). 2. Sell when something much better comes along.  And  1. Let your winners run. 2. Rebalance your portfolio when one or more stocks come to    dominate it in a big way.  There are some points on which most Fools will agree (penny stocks are bad, technical analysis is dubious), but many points on which we differ a little. Furthermore, scratch the surface of a Fool and you'll likely find that many of us are a little contradictory even within our own attitudes. That's fine. It just means we're complex, and that investing can also be complex. In some situations, buying and holding for decades might work well. In others, it might make sense to sell when something much more promising comes along.  If you're a good Foolish investor, you're always questioning, examining, thinking and rethinking. You're continually changing your perceptions of investing, perhaps after making some regrettable moves and pondering how they came to pass.  1. Life is simple: Eat, drink, breathe, sleep. 2. Life is complicated: Prepare a tax return, study physics,    raise children.  Wherever you go, even in investing, there are always contradictions. But that's okay. _________________________________________________________________  My Portfolio: http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=397081 My Discussion Boards: http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=397082 My Fool: http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=397083 Fool.com Home: http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=397084 My E-Mail Settings: http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=397085   SPONSORED BY: Ameritrade Open an Ameritrade  account now and get commission-free trades for 1 month.

Throw away your old bank statements."" -- Mary Schmich  ----------------------------------------------------------------- TOP STORY -----------------------------------------------------------------  VERIZON: LONG-DISTANCE BUSINESS RISIN' Telecommunications services giant Verizon (NYSE: VZ) said first-quarter profits from operations were $0.72 per share, up from $0.69 a year ago. The company, formed when Bell Atlantic bought GTE last summer, turned in revenues of $16.3 billion for the quarter. The EPS figure was a penny better than the consensus expectation of Wall Street analysts.  >>FULL STORY: http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=397706  ----------------------------------------------------------------- NEWS TO GO -----------------------------------------------------------------  Shrewd cost-cutting at Disney (NYSE: DIS) helped the company turned in fiscal second-quarter profit growth even as the top line took a dip. Revenues fell to $6 billion from $6.3 billion. Analysts were expecting an uptick to $6.4 billion. However, higher margins propped operating profits to $0.19 a share, well ahead of analyst estimates and last year's $0.14-a-share showing. Look for more coverage of Disney in Fool News & Commentary later today.  Contract electronics manufacturer Flextronics (Nasdaq: FLEX) said fiscal Q4 EPS was $0.22, up from last year's $0.17 but down $0.02 from Wall Street's projections. The company is cutting about 7,000 jobs, or 10% of its workforce, and trimming production capacity 15% in the face of slowing demand.  Mainframe software company BMC Software (NYSE: BMC) said it earned $0.26 per share in fiscal Q4, beating the Street's $0.24 consensus estimate and its own preannounced $0.23 to $0.25 range as revenues fell year-over-year to $422.8 million. The company pointed investors toward full fiscal-year sales growth of between 12% and 15%. http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=397707  Pay-for-performance Web search service GoTo.com (Nasdaq: GOTO) announced first-quarter losses of $0.13 per share, better than the year-ago $0.20 per-share loss and well ahead of the $0.31 to $0.33 range Wall Street was looking for. Revenues jumped more than 200% to $50 million for the quarter.  ----------------------------------------------------------------- HOT TOPICS ----------------------------------------------------------------- IBM GOES SHOPPING What's a billion, give or take?

The company's Q1 EPS dropped to $0.18 from $0.26 a year ago, though sales increased 21%, beating Street estimates of 17% growth. Alcatel expects a 5% to 15% sales increase this year.  >>FULL STORY: http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=398558  ----------------------------------------------------------------- NEWS TO GO -----------------------------------------------------------------  Got the Benz? DaimlerChrysler (NYSE: DCX) reported a $545.7 million Q1 operating loss, against a $2.19 billion profit a year ago. While the loss was a quarter to a third less than projected, it was hardly cause for investor rejoicing. The company was weighed down strongly by Freightliner, its sagging U.S. heavy truck unit, which faces a 50% decline in the North American market. During the quarter, the company took a $2.78 billion charge for restructuring Chrysler and 37.3%-owned Mitsubishi, and implemented a plan to cut Chrysler jobs 20%, or 26,000, over three years. Yet despite belt-tightening, the company's marketing expenses as a percent of revenue ballooned from 13.3% last year and 18.3% last quarter to 21.1%, against Ford Motor's (NYSE: F) 12.2%.  Look out, Warren Buffett! United Airlines parent UAL Corp. (NYSE: UAL) plans to offer within five years a fractional-jet ownership service with 200 planes seating six to 14 people. The current market leader is Berkshire Hathaway's (NYSE: BRK.A) Executive Jet unit, now running full-page glossy ads with a smiling Buffett enjoying his flight in a plane's commodious interior. Executive Jet sports 265 planes and reportedly plans to add 55 to 70 annually over the next five years. CEO Richard Santulli said he welcomes the competition, and jabbed, ""[United] won't have that luxury of putting up a 'cancelled' sign for a flight with corporate jets.""  Feet on the gas. Rising natural gas prices made profits, uh, gush at Chevron (NYSE: CHV), Amerada Hess (NYSE: AHC), Unocal (NYSE: UCL), and Kerr-McGee (NYSE: KMG). For the quarter ended March 31, the companies' earnings per share jumped 57%, 115%, 53%, and 65%, respectively, over the year-ago period, stomping Street estimates all around.  Home sweet home. The U.S. Commerce Department announced that March new home sales spiked 4.2% for a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.02 million units, with used home sales up 4.8% to a 5.44 million annual pace, just below June 1999's record 5.45 million rate. The median price for an existing home bumped up 6.5% from a year ago to $143,500, while the average price for an existing home increased 4.7% to $179,600. Historically low unemployment and declining mortgage rates are likely causes.  ----------------------------------------------------------------- HOT TOPICS -----------------------------------------------------------------  MICKEY MOUSE MAKES THE MARK Fools review Disney's earnings report and ask, ""Is the glass half-full or half-empty?"" http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=398559  APPLE'S IBOOK ON LAUNCHING PAD ""It appears that the long-awaited refresh of the iBook is coming.

Pepsi Bottling Group (NYSE: PBG), the cola company's leading bottler, will be joining its sugar-water daddy in the Standard & Poor's 500 Index over the weekend. The move is fitting since both Coke (NYSE: KO) and its largest distributor, Coca Cola Enterprises (NYSE: CCE), are already on board.  >>FULL STORY: http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=405058  ----------------------------------------------------------------- NEWS TO GO -----------------------------------------------------------------  Terra firmer? Online giant Terra Networks (Nasdaq: TRLY) reported a smaller-than-expected loss as cost-cutting helped offset a sluggish advertising market. The Spanish standout, whose buying spree eventually included the popular and then profitable portal Lycos, saw revenues take a 6% dip. The company also announced that it will lay off 15% of its workforce. I'll be back to scratch beneath this story's surface later this morning. http://www.lnksrv.com/m.asp?i=405059  The Dell (Nasdaq: DELL) tolls, as the company announced that it is cozy with first-quarter sales and earnings estimates but will lay off some of its workers in the process. The company will let go 3000 to 4000 employees -- as many as 10% of its workforce -- to offset falling demand and pricing pressures in the personal computer space. Our own Mike Trigg (TMF Tonto) will take a closer look at Dell's report later today.  Comcast's (Nasdaq: CMCSA) billion? The country's third-largest cable television operator reported a cool billion-dollar quarterly profit this morning -- but the 10-figure showing was actually the result of large investment gains. Sales clocked in 13% higher, at $2.2 billion. Comcast is beginning to reap the rewards of its costly buildout of digital broadband as entertainment-starved consumers clamor for more cable channels and faster Internet speeds.  In the beginning, Genesis Microchip (Nasdaq: GNSS) announced earnings, and they were good. The company reported a 75% uptick in revenue and a narrower-than-expected loss of $0.15 a share. Catering to the flat-panel monitor market, which is anything but flat nowadays, the integrated circuits maker also announced that top-line growth would exceed projections over the next few quarters.  ----------------------------------------------------------------- HOT TOPICS -----------------------------------------------------------------  CELERA AT A CROSSROADS ""Over the course of the next 8 to 12 months Celera is going to have to make some choices that will be very telling of what shapes this company for the long term."" http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=405060  HAS STARBUCKS ""TWEENED""?

Learn more at ameritrade.com http://www.lnksrv.com/m.asp?i=405184  ================================================================= YOUR QUESTIONS ANSWERED  Q. What's a ""run rate""?  A. Imagine that you're studying the financial statements of Digital Diapers Inc. (ticker: EPOOP) It's growing very rapidly from quarter to quarter. Perhaps, for some calculation, you need to estimate its current annual rate of sales. You could add up the last four quarters' worth, but that would clearly understate sales, as each quarter's numbers have been rising.  Enter the run rate. Take the most recent quarter's sales of $30 million (up from $25 million the quarter before and $21 million before that). Multiply that by four and you'll have the company's current run rate for sales: $120 million. This is not a forecast or a measure of past sales -- it's a reflection of the current level of annual sales.  Q. When you decide to sell a stock at a price listed in the newspaper on a particular day, do you get that particular amount, or the price listed when the shares are actually sold?  A. First, know that the stock prices listed in newspapers and online simply reflect the price at which the stock last traded. The next trade could occur at a higher or lower price, depending on supply and demand.  You're not out of luck, though. You have a choice when placing orders with your broker. You can sell ""at the market,"" which means whatever the current price happens to be, or you can place a ""limit order,"" specifying a minimum price that you require. Selling at the market means your shares will probably be sold quickly. With a limit order, though, you risk not getting any takers at your price. When we're not worried about the price jumping, we generally prefer trading at the market.  And speaking of brokers, make sure you're not overpaying for trades by visiting our online discount broker center. You can compare fees and services, plus get our guidance on finding the right broker for you. http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=405185  P.S. GOT AN INVESTING QUESTION FOR US? Post it on our Ask a Foolish Question message board. http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=405186  ----------------------------------------------------------------- THIS WEEK'S LESSON  WHEN TO PANIC The stock market has been down in recent months. (For some perspective, read our recent article on keeping your head during downturns.) Many investors are anxious, wondering whether they should follow the crowd and bail out on some of their investments. But, market drops are often the worst time to sell. Here are some pointers on the fine art of panicking. http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=405187  People tend to panic: - When the market tanks. - When a stock they own tanks. - When people around them are panicking.  None of these are particularly good reasons for panicking.  Here's when you might have cause for concern, though:  - When you don't know why you own the stocks you own. If you   have no clue why you ever bought shares of Bedmobile Inc.   (ticker: VROOM), you'll have a lot of trouble determining when   it's the right time to sell. Did VROOM's shares just take a   nosedive? It might be due to some fleeting market   misunderstanding, in which case you should hang on. Or it might   be due to some serious trouble at the firm. An informed investor   should have a good handle on her investments.  - When you don't understand the long-term upward trend of the   market. From decade to decade, stocks in great companies and the   market as a whole both tend to rise in value. To keep your blood   pressure down during market slumps, remind yourself of this.  - When you have a short time horizon. If your moolah is invested   in stocks for just a few months, then go ahead and begin   hyperventilating right now. Anything can happen in the short   term. Even stock in wonderful companies can temporarily   freefall. Any money you expect to need within the next five (if   not ten or more) years should be out of stocks and perhaps in   CDs or money market funds.  - When you haven't learned that it's the percentage of the   market drop that counts, not the points. A 100-point drop was a   big deal when the Dow was at 1,000. But when it's at 10,000, 100   points is just 1 percent.  Well-informed Fools should rarely panic. Expect occasional market slumps and surges. Read up on investing by checking out our 13 Steps. The more you learn, the less you'll panic. http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=405188  =================================================================  SPONSORED BY: Ameritrade Open an Ameritrade  account now and get commission-free trades for 1 month.

Some market watchers are calling the bottom for the business performance of networking equipment maker Cisco Systems (Nasdaq: CSCO). However,&nbsp;the company didn't provide much in the way of new forward guidance after turning in fiscal third-quarter results after last night's market close.  >>FULL STORY: http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=405805  ----------------------------------------------------------------- NEWS TO GO -----------------------------------------------------------------  Northrop Grumman (NYSE: NOC) matched General Dynamics' (NYSE: GD) bid for Newport News Shipbuilding (NYSE: NNS), the nation's leading maker of nuclear submarines. Although General's offer was in all cash and Northrop's was 75% cash and 25% stock, they are for essentially the same amount. Northrop claims its offer poses a better chance of getting past U.S. regulators.  News reports have Goldman Sachs (NYSE: GS) buying a 2.9% stake, valued at $1.11 billion, in Italy's Assicurazioni Generali, Europe's fourth-largest insurance company.  Tony women's apparel retailer Chico's FAS (NYSE: CHS) turned in April sales that rose a remarkable 68.5% to $32.1 million. Same-store sales for company-owned outlets improved 32.5%. Fiscal Q1 (ended May 5) sales jumped 64.4% as ""comps"" ran ahead 27.7%. ""Our increased marketing efforts and new television ads in concert with great product and excellent customer service continue to drive strong sales increases,"" said CEO Marvin Gralnick.  Leading video game manufacturer Electronic Arts (Nasdaq: ERTS) will make games for Nintendo's unreleased GameCube, the Japanese company's bid to reclaim its once-dominant position in the console business. GameCube will compete with Sony's (NYSE: SNE) PlayStation 2 and the on-the-way Xbox from Microsoft (Nasdaq: MSFT).  Researchers from voice-user-interface company Sound Advantage and Lucent's (NYSE: LU) Bell Labs will team to develop a speech recognition engine for Sound Advantage's messaging systems. Lucent will receive warrants to purchase Sound Advantage stock under the terms of the deal.  Food distribution company Fleming (NYSE: FLM) said fiscal Q1 (ended April 21) EPS was $0.41, up from $0.30 last year as cost-cutting measures helped the firm overcome a 4% drop in sales to $4.16 billion.  ----------------------------------------------------------------- HOT TOPICS -----------------------------------------------------------------  TIME TO SELL NOKIA?

The company earned $0.03 per share, beating Wall Street's estimate by two cents. Meanwhile, revenues increased 22% over the year-ago period to $127 million.  >>FULL STORY: http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=406777  ----------------------------------------------------------------- NEWS TO GO -----------------------------------------------------------------  Fiber optic telecom firm Global Crossing (NYSE: GX) beat Wall Street's first-quarter expectations after the market's close yesterday, though its loss nearly doubled from the previous year. The company posted a loss of $675.4 million, or $0.76 per share, compared to a loss of $348.1 million, or $0.45 per share, in the year-ago period. That was well ahead of Wall Street's estimate for a loss of $0.88 per share. Revenue grew to $1.1 billion from $906.6 million year-over-year.  Network storage firm EMC (NYSE: EMC) announced plans to repurchase 50 million shares of stock. With 2.2 billion shares outstanding, the repurchase translates to about 2.2% of the total float. According to the company's press release, stock purchased under the program will be available for various purposes, including employee stock option and employee stock purchase plans. The company said the news indicates the shares are a good investment.  Holding company Internet Capital Group (Nasdaq: ICGE) posted a pro forma net loss of $185 million, or $0.66 per share, compared to a net loss of $35 million, or $0.13 per share, in the year-ago period. The company cut 30 jobs in the quarter and will slice another 15 next month. Moreover, Internet Capital Group took a $1.2 billion charge because the value of its holdings has plummeted. For example, ICGE saw a $700 million drop in privately held software vendor Rightworks, which was recently acquired by to i2 Technologies (Nasdaq: ITWO).  Bar code maker Brady (NYSE: BRC) said yesterday it expects third-quarter earnings between $0.42 and $0.45 per share, well below the $0.51 per share it posted in the year-ago period. Wall Street's estimate calls for earnings of $0.49 per share. The company expects sales of $134 million, versus $142.5 million in the year-ago period. Brady also expects 2001 sales of $535 million to $550 million and earnings of $1.60 to $1.75 per share.  ----------------------------------------------------------------- HOT TOPICS -----------------------------------------------------------------  TROUBLES AT DELL Amidst layoffs and PC price wars, Dell Fools take a critical look at the state of the company. http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=406778  LOOKING FOR THE REAL CISCO ""I'm amazed and disheartened at how much negativity about Cisco is written by people who are not even inside the company."" http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=406779  GOT A CELL PHONE?

First among them: On Friday, an advisory panel recommended to the FDA that Schering's Claritin allergy drug -- and similar offerings from other companies, including Aventis (NYSE: AVE) and Pfizer (NYSE: PFE), which make for a multibillion-dollar business -- should be cleared for over-the-counter, non-prescription sale. http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=408423  >>FULL STORY: http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=408424  ----------------------------------------------------------------- NEWS TO GO -----------------------------------------------------------------  Canadian networking equipment company Nortel (NYSE: NT) will lose CEO John Roth to retirement next year. Likely successor and COO Clarence Chandran, meanwhile, is quitting for medical reasons, and so Roth will stick around to lead the search for his replacement.  SunTrust Banks (NYSE: STI) surprised investors by making a $14.7 billion bid for Wachovia (NYSE: WB), which is already betrothed to First Union (NYSE: FTU). SunTrust's offer is 17% more than First Union's based on Friday's closing prices for the competing stock swap bids. For more on the First Union deal, read Brian Graney's mid-April article. http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=408425  Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A), Warren Buffett's insurance and investing conglomerate, said first-quarter net earnings per share were $397, down from $531 last year. Operating earnings, meanwhile, improved to $462 million from $354 million. The company's report can be viewed at its website. http://www.lnksrv.com/m.asp?i=408426  Telecommunications giant AT&T (NYSE: T) reportedly said in an SEC filing that it will saddle its broadband business unit with more debt than any of its other units, or approximately $28.4 billion, when it splits into four separate companies later this year. For more on the company's current exchange offer of shares of AT&T Wireless (NYSE: AWE), check out Bill Mann's column of last week. http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=408427  Pizza mover Papa John's (Nasdaq: PZZA) said April comparable sales fell 5.3% even as total revenues rose 27%. Last year comparables rose 7.3%. The company said some of the difference can be attributed to its anniversary promotion, which ran in Q2 last year but Q1 this time around. ----------------------------------------------------------------- HOT TOPICS -----------------------------------------------------------------  EBAY TIGHTENS THE RULES Fools on the eBay board bid up their thoughts on the company's new rule to ban links to third-party sites and storefronts. http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=408428  MY DISNEY INVESTMENT SEEMS GOOFY This Fool's 1998 investment is worth exactly the same amount today.

"Dear Ben, We had a meeting at your offices last December where I expressed my interest in pursuing a rotation in your division. As you may remember, you set me a meeting with Jeff Donahue that same evening. I understood back then that it was a bit early in the process.  In August I will be joining the firm as an Associate and now that the management at your division might have a more clear idea of your needs, I would like to reaffirm my interest in pursuing a rotation at your department. I am confident that the skills that I have built in the past constitute a good basis for dealing with the demands of the group in the present.  I would also very much appreciate if you could give me any suggestions in order to maximize my chances. I would fly to Houston in order to meet with and whomever you think appropriate at your request. I am attaching my updated resume. Please pass it around.  I will give you a call in a couple of days.

Invest in your future career today! http://www.lnksrv.com/m.asp?i=409219  ================================================================= YOUR QUESTIONS ANSWERED  Q. What's an order imbalance?  A. Order imbalances happen on stock exchanges such as the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) when there are too many buy orders and not enough sell orders -- or vice versa. When they occur, the exchange might halt trading temporarily, to allow more of the other kind of order to come in. This permits better matching of buyers and sellers, and makes prices less volatile.  You might see order imbalances happen whenever there's very good or bad news related to a company and suddenly many people want in or out of it.  The Nasdaq stock market, meanwhile, operates on more of a supply-and-demand basis, with its trading conducted between many market participants. It doesn't halt trading for order imbalances.   Q. Don't you think that anyone who doesn't sell a stock near its all-time high is a fool?  A. A Fool with a capital ""F,"" maybe, but not an idiot. It's true that many stocks are now down considerably from their all-time highs. But few stocks ever go up in a straight line. And any stock that continually rises will continually set all-time highs. It's not consistently possible to know what a stock will do in the short term, so we avoid trying to carefully time purchases or sales.  If you're ever holding onto stock in a company whose future doesn't look too bright or stock that seems grossly overvalued, you might do well to sell But those of us who have long-term faith in a company and expect its price to be significantly higher in the decades ahead, we'll often do well just happily hanging on. Many volatile but solid stocks have often been halved, only to double and quadruple again.   P.S. GOT AN INVESTING QUESTION FOR US? Post it on our Ask a Foolish Question message board. http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=409220  ----------------------------------------------------------------- THIS WEEK'S LESSON  COMMON FINANCIAL MISTAKES  Be smart about managing your money. Here are some common financial mistakes, and a few resources to help you avoid them:  - Racking up credit card debt. It feels like free money, but it   isn't. High interest rates increase your debt, making it harder   and harder to pay off. That's reverse investing! Remedy: Find   our nine ways to pay it back.   http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=409221  - Not investing soon enough. You're rarely too young or too old   to invest. Kids have the most to gain from many decades of stock   appreciation. But even retirees can benefit from leaving in   stocks whatever money they won't need for five or ten years.   Remedy: See how you can start investing with only $20 a month.   http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=409222  - Investing too conservatively. Any long-term investment is   likely to grow most rapidly in stocks.  - Over- or under-diversifying. If all your eggs are in two or   three baskets, you're exposed to too much risk. If you have too   many baskets to count, then you probably aren't able to keep up   with each company. Between five and 15 stocks is a manageable   number for most people. . Remedy: Index funds are a great place   to start.   http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=409223  - Focusing inordinately on a stock's price. Contrary to popular   opinion, a ""cheap"" stock isn't a bargain. Penny stocks, those   trading for less than $5 each, are risky and dangerous. A $150   stock can actually be a bargain, and if your funds are limited,   you can always just buy a few shares.  - Investing in what you don't understand. The more familiar you   are with how your company works and how well it's performing,   the fewer unpleasant surprises you're likely to encounter.  - Relying on the advice of others. It's great to learn from   others, but ultimately you should make your own decisions.   You're the one who cares the most about your finances.  - Not tracking your returns. Shrug off this duty at your own   peril. You always want to be (in the long run) beating a   benchmark such as the S&P 500. If you're not beating it, you   might as well meet it, by investing in an index fund. Remedy:   Track your portfolio for free on our website.   http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=409224  - Impatience. Building great wealth takes time.  Perhaps the worst mistake is never taking the time to learn about investing. You're not making that one, though, if you're reading and thinking about this article!  =================================================================  SPONSORED BY: Kaplan College Become a Financial Planner!

Quite a bit, apparently, as Krispy Kreme (Nasdaq: KREM) today issued guidance through the end of fiscal 2003 even as it reported financial results for the first quarter of fiscal 2002 (ended April 29).  >>FULL STORY: http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=409791  ----------------------------------------------------------------- NEWS TO GO -----------------------------------------------------------------  Preppy apparel retailer Abercrombie & Fitch (NYSE: ANF) said fiscal Q1 (ended May 5) EPS rose to $0.20, up from $0.16 last year and three pennies better than Wall Street's consensus. The company pointed investors toward EPS of $0.22 for Q2, in-line with current projections.  Gallium arsenide telecommunications chip maker TriQuint Semiconductor (Nasdaq: TQNT) agreed to buy wireless communications components company Sawtek (Nasdaq: SAWS) with stock valued, as of last night's close, at $1.29 billion. TriQuint's $29.92 per-share offer was a 15% premium over last night's close for Sawtek.  Sporting equipment company Rawlings (Nasdaq: RAWL) sold its Vic Hockey division to Vic Hockey Co. Terms of the deal were not disclosed. ""We now look forward to focusing our energy on building our core brand equity,"" said Chairman and CEO Steve O'Hara.  Leading jewelry retailer Tiffany (NYSE: TIF) said fiscal Q1 (ended April 30) net income rose slightly though EPS was flat, year-over-year, at $0.20. That was a penny better than expected by Wall Street. Revenues fell 2.5% to $336.4 million. While U.S. and international retail sales fell year-over-year, direct marketing revenues actually improved, though the base upon which they grew was relatively small at less than 10% of total sales.  Middleware software vendor BEA Systems (Nasdaq: BEAS) turned in fiscal Q1 (ended April 30) EPS of $0.05, up from last year's $0.03 per-share loss. That figure included acquisition-related costs, without which BEA came in a penny ahead of the Street's $0.07 per-share estimate. The company also boosted its full-year EPS guidance to $0.43 from $0.41.  ----------------------------------------------------------------- HOT TOPICS -----------------------------------------------------------------  APPLE SAYS ""SHOP DIFFERENT"" As Apple guns for increased market share, Fools are applauding the opening of the company's first retail stores. http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=409792  POSTMORTEM ON THE RAMBUS RULING Read the transcripts of the Rambus conference call as recorded by a Fool, and find out in the company's own words where it's going from here. http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=409793  IS EMC TOO EXPENSIVE?

Hewlett-Packard (NYSE: HWP) reported Q2 EPS of $0.16, against $0.45 last year, but beating Street expectations of $0.15. The company began the quarter with an estimate of $0.40 per share, which it reduced to $0.35 in mid-April around the time it announced it would reduce management by 3,000 out of 14,000. The company said Q3 EPS estimates of $0.23 were reasonable. President and CEO Carly Fiorina reportedly said on a conference call with analysts, ""While we don't see it getting a lot worse, we don't see it getting substantially better in the near term.''  Ciena not burnt. Fiber optic systems vendor Ciena (Nasdaq: CIEN) continued to avoid the telecom slowdown and reported Q2 EPS of $0.20 -- excluding acquisition charges and payroll taxes for stock options -- more than three times the company's year-ago showing of $0.06 a share and beating analysts' consensus forecast by $0.04 a share. Ciena has maintained that its business is relatively unaffected by telecom customer spending woes because it makes new, advanced systems, not equipment for legacy systems. Ciena also promoted Chief Operating Officer Gary Smith to Chief Executive, moving current Chairman and CEO Patrick Nettles to the position of executive chairman. Jeff Fischer wrote yesterday about the insidious practice of trumpeting numbers that exclude some kinds of onetime charges. http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=410955  M'm! M'm!... OK? Drip Portfolio holding Campbell Soup (NYSE: CPB) posted Q3 EPS of $0.30, meeting Street expectations, but down $0.02 a share from last year. Net sales increased from $1.39 billion to $1.44 billion, but advertising expenses jumped 50% and total marketing expenses 10%. The company expects Q4 earnings to be reduced by $0.03 a share due to the restructuring of Arnott's, Campbell's Australian biscuit operation, and $0.02 to $0.03 a share due to the integration of Unilever's soup and sauce business. http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=410956  Bluelight district. Discount retailer Kmart (NYSE: KM) reported a Q1 loss of $0.05 a share, against a $0.06-a-share profit a year ago, despite a 1.7% increase in total sales. The company said it was spending more on new computer systems and customer service.

PC maker Dell (Nasdaq: DELL) yesterday lowered guidance and reported fiscal first-quarter (ended May 4) earnings in-line with Wall Street's expectations. The company's aggressive pricing continues to yield additional market share, but it's also hurting earnings growth.  >>FULL STORY: http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=411717  ----------------------------------------------------------------- NEWS TO GO -----------------------------------------------------------------  Handheld device maker Palm (Nasdaq: PALM) expects fourth-quarter sales of $140 million to $160 million, compared to earlier guidance of $300 million to $315 million. That lowered outlook means it will post a loss of $170 million to $190 million, versus earlier guidance for earnings of $80 million to $85 million. Palm is also taking a $300 million inventory charge and canceling its merger with Extended Systems (Nasdaq: XTND) due to market conditions. The Fool covered the handheld market this week in an article entitled ""Game Over for Palm and Handspring?"" http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=411718  Test and measurement equipment maker Agilent Technologies (NYSE: A) posted lower-than-expected second-quarter profits yesterday, citing slowing customer demand and a number of large order cancellations. The company reported earnings of $0.26 per share, a penny below Wall Street's consensus expectation. Agilent's sales were $2.7 billion, compared to $2.5 billion in the year-ago period. Next quarter, it expects a loss of $0.20 to $0.30 per share, well below Wall Street's earlier estimate for earnings of $0.25 per share.  Embedded software vendor Wind River Systems (Nasdaq: WIND) beat lowered first-quarter estimates yesterday, but said sales would fall 10% next quarter. The company posted earnings of $0.06 per share, compared to $0.11 per share in the year-ago quarter. Revenue came in at $110.2 million. Next quarter, the company expects sales of $96 million to $99 million and earnings of $0.01 to $0.03 per share. Wind River is also cutting its workforce by 12% to 15%. The Fool covered the company's warning earlier this month. http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=411719  Clothing retailer Gap (NYSE: GPS) said its first-quarter earnings were in-line with Wall Street's expectations. Earnings fell 2% year-over-year to $0.13 per share. Revenues increased 16% year-over-year to $3.2 billion, but same-store sales, which measure sales growth at stores that have been open for more than a year, fell 7%. Gap failed to give any guidance, instead reiterating earlier comments that same-store sales will fall in the second quarter.

Judging by the number of boxes on an average drugstore shelf, pretty big. That notion was confirmed this morning as consumer products giant and FOOL 50 component Procter & Gamble (NYSE: PG) agreed to by the Clairol business from Bristol-Myers Squibb (NYSE: BMY). http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=412614 http://www.lnksrv.com/m.asp?i=412615  >>FULL STORY: http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=412616  ----------------------------------------------------------------- NEWS TO GO -----------------------------------------------------------------  AT&T (NYSE: T) said Friday that Cox Communications (NYSE: COX) and Comcast (Nasdaq: CMCSA) will keep their stakes in cable Internet access company Excite@Home (Nasdaq: ATHM) rather than sell them. In a remarkable deal, Cox and Comcast will not only hold on to their shares of the broadband company -- majority-owned by AT&T -- but get more shares of the telecommunications giant than they originally would have received in exchange for getting out of Excite@Home. AT&T, according to reports, stands to get a substantial tax benefit as a result.  The FDA rejected Pharmacia's (NYSE: PHA) proposed Vestra antidepressant, already sold elsewhere in the world as Edronax. While disappointing, the drug's current worldwide sales are only $100 million, small potatoes by Big Pharma standards. Pharmacia would nevertheless like complements to its blockbuster Celebrex arthritis drug, and the company has higher hopes for an FDA panel's review planned for later this year.  Shrek, the computer-generated feature from privately held Dreamworks, sent a warning shot across Disney's (NYSE: DIS) bow this weekend by posting the best-ever opening by a non-sequel animated feature and the second-best animated opening ever, according to reports. The movie, which opened at the second-largest number of theaters of any movie ever, will (amazingly) be shown in more locations in the coming weeks despite some theaters running shows at 45-minute intervals. As someone who saw it, well, let's just say it's one for the kiddies.  Insurer MetLife (NYSE: MET) Friday filed with the SEC to sell up to $4 billion in common and preferred stock -- as well as other forms of securities -- to fund operations. Todd Lebor took a closer look at MetLife in a February column. http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=412617  Federated Department Stores (NYSE: FD) said its board OK'd a $500 million boost to its stock buyback plan, which had $250 million in authorized repurchases remaining. Federated could buy the shares on the open market or through other transactions. In other company news, Chairman and CEO James Zimmerman said Friday that Federated was not one of the companies interested in buying Brooks Brothers, as was reported in The London Times.  ----------------------------------------------------------------- HOT TOPICS -----------------------------------------------------------------  AMD GETS SOME RAVES Some developers are feeling chipper about AMD's Athlon, and Fools are offering their opinions. http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=412618  WHY SHOULD DELL FEAR AND RESPECT APPLE?

Invest in your future career today! http://www.lnksrv.com/m.asp?i=413427  ================================================================= YOUR QUESTIONS ANSWERED  Q. My company matches a certain percent of my pay, depending on how much I contribute to my 401(k) plan. The matching money goes only into the company employee stock-purchase program, but my own contributions can go into various mutual funds. Shouldn't I at least contribute enough to this 401(k) to get the maximum amount that the company will match?  A. You've answered your own question correctly. In most cases, it's definitely smart to take advantage of as much company matching as possible. Let's say that for every $1 you sock away in your 401(k), your employer chips in 50 cents. That's an immediate 50 percent return! It would be extremely difficult to beat that with any investment method.  The only time it might not be so great is if the matching money isn't going into something you're comfortable with. If it's going into stock in the company and you're very uncomfortable about the company's future, then perhaps you're getting a 50 percent return that will soon become a 0 percent return. That's an extreme example, though. And even in that case, the money that YOU socked away can be in a safer place, growing. For a 60-second guide to 401(k)s, check out this article.   Q. If I own shares of a company and the company is bought out or merges with another company, what happens to my shares? http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=413428  A. Several things could happen. If the firm is bought out for cash, you might receive a check for your shares. If it's bought with stock or there's a merger involving a stock swap, your shares might be replaced with shares of another company. The number of shares you get will be prescribed by an announced formula. Some deals involve both stock and cash. When a deal you're interested in is announced, track down its press releases for details.   P.S. GOT AN INVESTING QUESTION FOR US? Post it on our Ask a Foolish Question message board. http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=413429  ----------------------------------------------------------------- THIS WEEK'S LESSON  DIVIDEND YIELDS A company's ""dividend yield"" is a valuable concept to understand, but many people scratch their heads when confronted with it. So let us explain. It simply expresses the relationship of two numbers: a stock's price and the amount of its annual dividend.  As an example, look at Ford Motor Co. At the time of this writing, it was trading around $51 per share, and paying out $2 per year (in quarterly installments) as a dividend. Take $2 and divide it by $51 and you'll get 0.039. Multiply that by 100 and you've got a dividend yield of 3.9%. This means that if you pay $51 for a share of Ford, you'll earn 3.9% per year on your investment, just from dividends alone.  Companies rarely decrease or eliminate their dividends, as that would make investors unhappy. But, dividends of solid companies do tend to rise over time, delivering more value to shareholders. Every now and then, a company will announce an increase. If, in 20 years, Ford's dividend is $8, that would represent a 15.7% dividend yield on those shares you bought for $51. You'd be earning a 15.7% return each year, just from dividends. There would probably be some stock price appreciation on top of that, as well.  Note that, for months or years at a time, a dividend will hold steady. But, the yield can fluctuate daily. That's because a stock's price fluctuates. As a stock price rises, the dividend yield falls, and vice versa. If Ford shares, for example, suddenly doubled in price to $102, the yield would be halved, to 2% ($2 divided by $102 is 0.02). If Ford stock fell to $30 per share, its yield for those buying it at $30 would be 6.7%.  You can find some hefty dividend yields among companies whose stock prices have tumbled. A year or two ago, for example, R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Holdings paid about $3.00 per share in annual dividends. With its stock trading around $30 per share, that was a whopping 10% dividend yield! Be careful, though. If you're attracted to an unusually high dividend yield, you should probably study the company extra carefully to make sure it's not in so much trouble that a dividend cut is around the corner.  Lastly, know that not all companies pay dividends. Younger or quickly growing companies in particular, such as Microsoft or Amgen, prefer to plow extra cash back into operations.  =================================================================  SPONSORED BY: Kaplan College Become a Financial Planner!

Intuit posted pro forma profits of $0.55 per share, beating Wall Street's expectation by two pennies. Revenues were $425.2 million, below Wall Street's estimate of $435 million.  >>FULL STORY: http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=413935  ----------------------------------------------------------------- NEWS TO GO -----------------------------------------------------------------  Novell (Nasdaq: NOVL), best known for its server operating system, announced a second-quarter pro forma loss of $0.03 per share, versus earnings of $0.02 per share in the year-ago period. Wall Street expected earnings of $0.03 per share. Revenue was $240.8 million, compared with $302.3 million in the year-ago period. Novell is also cutting 5% of its workforce. The layoffs, coupled with additional savings in travel, advertising, and recruiting, are expected to return the company to profitability.  Business-to-business software vendor Agile Software (Nasdaq: AGIL) announced a fourth-quarter pro forma loss of $0.05 per share, compared with a loss of $0.02 per share in the year-ago period, and in-line with Wall Street's expectations. Revenue increased 140% year-over-year to $26 million. Agile makes software that allows companies to exchange information over the Internet. Last month, Ariba (Nasdaq: ARBA) called off its acquisition of the company.  Computer Associates (NYSE: CA), the world's third-largest software company, posted pro forma pro rata income (i.e., results that are adjusted to allow the effects of a new sales model to be compared against past numbers) of $0.47 per share, compared to $0.34 per share in the year-ago period. That beat Wall Street's estimate by a penny. Pro forma pro rata revenue increased 3.6% year-over-year to $1.4 billion.  Computer graphic chipmaker Nvidia (Nasdaq: NVDA) maintained its full-year guidance and reported first-quarter earnings of $0.40 per share, compared with $0.24 per share in the year-ago period. Sales came in at $240.9 million, compared with $148.5 million in the year-ago period. While other chipmakers are struggling, shares of Nvidia have grown nearly twofold since January. In the press release, CEO Jen-Hsun Huang highlighted the company's entrance into the mobile and Apple (Nasdaq: AAPL) markets.  ----------------------------------------------------------------- HOT TOPICS -----------------------------------------------------------------  WELCOME!

Last month, Alcatel (NYSE: ALA) CEO Serge Tchurek said that a Lucent (NYSE: LU) asset sale ""is a determining event for all the actors in this market."" Apparently, the French telecommunications equipment giant wants to play more than a bit part in this epic. http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=416502  >>FULL STORY: http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=416503  ----------------------------------------------------------------- NEWS TO GO -----------------------------------------------------------------  It's a day that will live in blockbuster infamy. Disney's (NYSE: DIS) Pearl Harbor failed to live up to the hype as the film that would finally topple 1997's Jurassic Park's The Lost World from the top slot of the four-day opening weekend. The movie still nailed a respectable $75 million in estimated box office ticket sales. I'll be taking a closer look at how the summer multiplex season is playing out later today.  Talk about your Palm (Nasdaq: PALM) pilots! Hewlett-Packard (NYSE: HWP) and accounting titan PricewaterhouseCoopers announced that they would team up to provide consulting services to the airline industry on how to introduce handheld computers and the Internet into the work space. Is improving communication services the key to air carrier efficiency? Maybe. Now let's see them do something about that bland airline food.  The chips are down. That might not be much of a surprise to semi watchers, but a closer glimpse into the industry's slump was warranted. According to the World Semiconductor Trade Statistics group, global chip sales are expected to fall by 14% this year from last year's $204 billion showing.  ----------------------------------------------------------------- HOT TOPICS -----------------------------------------------------------------  A KRISPY KREME CHALLENGE What's the justification for Krispy Kreme's current price?

A U.S. district judge yesterday approved Coca-Cola's (NYSE: KO) proposed $192.5 million settlement for a race discrimination lawsuit filed by 2,200 black employees. Coca-Cola had denied the charges in the lawsuit, which included discrimination in promotion and compensation. The settlement, according to Reuters, is the largest ever for a race discrimination case.  Diversified manufacturing company Tyco International (NYSE: TYC) agreed to buy medical products company C.R. Bard (NYSE: BCR) in a $3.2 billion stock swap expected to value the company at $60 per share, or about a 30% premium to last night's close. C.R. Bard's revenue in 2000 was $1.1 billion and makes equipment used in vascular, urological, and oncological diagnosis, among other products.  Consumer electronics retailer Radio Shack (NYSE: RSH) announced that slower-than-expected Q2 sales will result in EPS from $0.25 to $0.27, missing Wall Street's $0.34 consensus projection and last year's $0.38. Same-store sales look to come in flat year-over-year.  Internet career search giant TMP Worldwide (Nasdaq: TMPW), which operates the Monster.com site, said it bought the FlipDog.com job site from WhizBang! Labs on May 25. Terms of the deal were not disclosed.  Athletic footwear company K-Swiss (Nasdaq: KSWS) formed a joint venture with Rugged Shark to develop and market a line of National Geographic-inspired outdoor and casual footwear. K-Swiss expects it'll cost $1 million to get the line up and ready for a fall 2002 launch. K-Swiss will own 75% of the venture.  ----------------------------------------------------------------- HOT TOPICS -----------------------------------------------------------------  MICROSOFT GOES AOL HUNTING Microsoft has its sights on AOL's customers.

BME will only get 30 minute reserves (and 10 minute reserves) from market participants that have specifically bid to provide the reserves.  SCD does not specifically secure 30 minute reserves, it dispatches all on dispatch units to their economic loading point while assuring that the units that have bid 10 minute spinning reserve are held back from their economic operating point, if necessary, to assure the 10 minute spinning reserves. To track the 30 minute reserves the Operators use another program that identifies how much 30 minute reserves are available from all on dispatch units on the system plus the 30 minute GTs that provide 30 minute reserves. The result of the SCD non-treatment of 30 minute reserves and the treatment in the other program is that the NYISO real-time operation does not necessarily carry reserves on the units it purchased them from and instead may get the 30 minute reserves in real-time from units that did not offer them.  The different treatment of 30 minute reserves from spinning units by BME and SCD can become a problem and lead to divergence of BME/SCD prices when loads are relatively high.  In those cases, if only a small amount of on dispatch units have offered 30 minute reserves, BME will take the reserves from those units and meet its energy requirements from more expensive options.  When it gets to the real-time operation, SCD will get the energy from the less expensive units that were tagged as 30 minute reserve providers and carry its reserves on more expensive units on dispatch.  To make matters even worse, BME may have taken one or more marginal purchases in an effort to procure the 30 minute reserves rather than, erroneously, rely upon more expensive internal generation.  This will further depress real time prices.  Fortunately, there is an easy fix for this problem that does not require anything other than a change in generator's bidder behavior.  The problem stems from there being more on dispatch units considered for reserve by SCD than were considered for reserve by BME.  This is easily solved if all operating on dispatch units offer 30 minute reserves into the BME.  Offering 30 minute reserves is most important for on dispatch units with expensive incremental energy bid costs.  This will enable BME to consider all the units as providers of reserves that SCD will ultimately consider as providers of reserves.  This will let BME take its energy from the units with cheaper marginal energy costs and its reserves from the units with more expensive marginal energy costs just like SCD.  This will also keep BME from making uneconomic external purchases because it thinks its only options are taking energy from expensive internal units (such as units running above their UOL levels) or purchasing a slightly less expensive import.

More detailed reports can be found on our client link website.  Industry / Company Updates  REITs, Life Insurance & Annuities, Oils, Specialty Finance, Asset Management & Brokerage,  Insurance - Property/Casualty. Leisure/Cruise lines, Storage, Electrical Utility, Advertising.  REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT TRUSTS           WTC'S IMPACT ON MANHATTAN OFFICE REITS  - Could see as much as 25 million sqft of downtown office impacted  - Companies with major office exposure in NYC  Brookfield Properties has the most significant downtown office exposure; Boston Properties, Equity Office, SL Green and Vornado have most assets in Midtown.  - Suburban office companies may see increased demand  Reckson and Mack-Cali have the most significant New York metro suburban office exposure; Consequently our rating on CLI is under review.  LIFE INSURANCE & ANNUITIES              ASSESSING THE IMPACT OF THE WTC TRAGEDY  - The tragic events of September 11 will impact several operations  Group and individual life insurance, disability, COLI, and even annuity operations will be impacted by the disaster at the World Trade Center and Pentagon on Tuesday.  - Institutional operations and reinsurance will likely be hardest hit  Life reinsurers and companies with significant group life and group disability operations will likely face significantly higher losses as they pay the claims of the victims.  - Difficult to assess individual company impact so far It is logical to expect that New York domicile companies will have higher exposure.  We also expect fundamentals of companies with large group life, AD&D, and disability to be under  pressure.  - We are waiting on additional information before adjusting estimates  Industry fundamentals will likely come under pressure, and estimates will fall materially for several companies.  However, we believe the industry has substantial excess capital to absorb these losses.  ENERGY: OILS                            CRUDE OIL OUTLOOK UPDATED: BP REMAINS FAVORITE  - Crude Oil Outlook $25-30 For 2H 2001 But...  Supply and demand to be balanced during 2H 2001, with stocks to remain around 75 days forward demand. This is a positive price scenario.  - Recent Global Tensions to Require Reassessment  Demand will likely slow with reduced economic growth. Output disruption in Afghanistan would have a negligible impact on markets.  Iraq and Iran would be significantly more concerning.  - Maintain Market Position With Positive Bias  ""Super Major"" BP (PT $65/sh.) remains our favorite integrated oil, with ExxonMobil and Royal-Dutch/Shell expected to Outperform as well.  FINANCE: SPECIALTY/MORTGAGE             ISSUES TO CONSIDER IN THE AFTERMATH  - Reassessing fundamentals in aftermath of WTC attack  While we can't opine with confidence on macro-economic trends or investor sentiment, we can reassess the fundamental outlook for our two sectors in the light of greater uncertainty.  - Remain confident in mortgage finance fundamentals  The housing markets benefit from secular drivers that should help withstand potential impact of the WTC attack on consumer confidence or economic growth.  - Patience may still be required in the credit card sector  While we're encouraged by the slowdown in consumer credit growth, we feel it is too early to bet on a turn in the credit cycle.  ASSET MANAGEMENT & BROKERAGE            TAKING STOCK  - Providing Some Perspective on this week's Tragedy  Details are still coming in, but in the near-term we expect reduced capacity and higher volatility in the brokerage sector.  For asset managers, continued weak flows.  - Near-term Tug of War is likely  Key issues are the unsettled global markets, partially offset by the potential for additional  central bank liquidity.  Separately, infrastructure and operational issues will make things ""choppy"" at best.  - Are globalization, deregulation, and retirement savings still the key?  We think so, but we acknowledge a backlash towards global connectivity could slow capital flows, expansion, and consolidation.  INSURANCE - PROPERTY-CASUALTY           THE AFTERMATH OF TRAGEDY  - Largest loss, by all accounts: The World Trade Center attack will be the largest insured event in history.  - Our current working range of losses is $25-30 billion  This is up to 20% higher than figures being quoted by some others.  We believe such a loss would not pose a bankruptcy threat or rating threat to most major insurers.  - Strong companies will recoup losses through higher rates  Being adequately capitalized, companies with strong claims-paying ratings will be well-positioned to write profitable business at much higher rates in 2002.  - Investors should try not to overreact  When the market opens, we would not sell into panic, and for stocks that you otherwise  want to own, we would add on weakness.     LEISURE/CRUISE LINES                     WHERE IS VALUATION SUPPORTIVE?  - Recent Strength In Cruise Demand Primed To Reverse  Despite recent positive signals surrounding cruise demand, there is no question in our mind  that bookings will slow over the next several months in the wake of current events in NYC and DC.  - Lowering 2002 Demand Growth Assumption To 7% From 9%  As such we're taking down our '02 industry yield assumption to (2%), and our EPS estimates by 8% for Carnival and 15% for Royal Caribbean.  - The Big Question -- How Will The Market React Once Trading Resumes?  To prepare ourselves for all potential outcomes, we conducted a valuation sensitivity analysis showing what levels the stocks should be considered oversold, fairly valued, and over valued.  - We Expect A 20% Hit To Cruise Stock Prices  This would leave the stocks as cheap as they should get on real numbers -- even in recessionary times. With 30% or more, we'd be buyers. With little move, we'd likely be sellers.  ELECTRIC UTILITIES/UNREGULATED POWER     DEFENSIVE PORTS IN A STORM  - Electric power stocks should benefit from 'flight to quality'  We expect regulated and unregulated/integrated groups to perform well relative to the market when trading resumes, as investors rotate into defensive stocks.  - Regulated utilities are classic defensive stocks  Our favorite integrated names that are still heavily regulated monopolies with safe dividends are FPL, TXU and ETR - each trading at 10-11X '02E and yields of 3-5%.  - Integrateds have served as bellweathers in such difficult times  We would also be buyers of highly liquid, solid, well-diversified integrated utilities.  DUK and D are our favorites among such a list.  - Unregulateds inherently defensive & may benefit from greater volatility  Little exposure to consumer confidence as primary end market of electricity sales are highly stable and resistant to economic cycles.  Our favorites are CPN & MIR.  AD HOC: ADVERTISING AND MARKETING SERVICES         THE MOURNING AFTER: ASSESSING  - History of war's impact on ad spending indicates potential lift for '02 . Looking at five wars since 1900, US ad spending showed an incremental lift of 170 basis points, on average, during the first year of war.  - Outdoor and Magazine ad media have outperformed in similar times  These two media increased 7.7% and 6.1%, respectively, during the five major US wars of this century.  Radio, Newspapers and Broadcast TV follow with growth of 4.4%, 2.9% and 2.0%.  - Morgan Stanley economists seem to be assuming 10% market correction  Advertising & Marketing Services consumer-oriented clients are likely to have more valuation downside.  All of our consumer sectors should be considered market weight.  - Companies associated with consumer staples may be safer right now  Catalina and Valassis could be considered slightly safer if their consumer staples advertisers in groceries and pharmacies retrench less than other marketers.  ENTERPRISE SOFTWARE                INDUSTRY ANALYSIS  - Enterprise Software Impact:  For the near term we see incremental risk for the September  quarter since software companies tend to close most of the deals in the last ten days of the  quarter.  Decisionmakers are likely to be pre-occupied with other decisions.  Companies with  particular expsosure the brokerage community such as Tibco and Advent Software (portfolio  management software) would be at the top of the list for incremental risk in the short term.  Longer term, these events underscore the need for backup and recovery software and Veritas  would likely see some benefit over time as well as  Oracle who's database has built in features for replication and hot backup capabilities (in conjunction with Veritas).  Reliability and recovery issues will become more important items on  the checklist as will consulting services.  - Oracle will go forward with its earnings release this evening after the close of the market.  We are expecting 8cents per share in earnings                                          ",benjamin.rogers@enron.com,jaime.gualy@enron.com,FW: Assesing the Impact on Various Industries,2001-09-13 08:32:46-07:00,received

Invest in your future career today! http://www.lnksrv.com/m.asp?i=497031  ================================================================= YOUR QUESTIONS ANSWERED  Q. HOW COULD A COMPANY HAVE A PRICE-TO-EARNINGS (P/E) RATIO OF 77 AND A PROJECTED P/E OF 22?  A. If it currently trades at $77 per share and has $1 per share in annual earnings, its P/E is 77. If it's growing rapidly and is expected to earn $3.50 next year, the projected P/E for that year is 22 (77 divided by 3.50 is 22).  Q. WHY DO BONDS FALL IN VALUE WHEN INTEREST RATES RISE?  A. To be precise, the prices of existing bonds will fall when interest rates rise. The prices of newly issued bonds are fixed. But let's back up a bit. Higher interest rates mean that companies are likely to borrow less, produce less and thus earn less. Since stock prices are tied to how much a company can earn, higher interest rates theoretically cause stock prices to fall. This, coupled with rising bond interest rates, makes bonds more attractive to investors.  Imagine 5 percent bonds with 10 years left until maturity that originally sold for $1,000 each. If you buy these bonds now, you'll be getting $50 per year from each of them and then $1,000 at maturity. But if interest rates have risen since those bonds were issued and you can buy new 10-year bonds that pay you 10 percent, that amounts to $100 per year per $1,000 invested. You would obviously be willing to pay more for the 10-percent bonds than the 5 percent ones. So the price of 5 percent bonds will fall. It will fall to the point where $1,000 invested in the 5 percent bond will bring you same total yield-to-maturity as $1,000 invested in the new bond.  ----------------------------------------------------------------- THIS WEEK'S LESSON  BANKING THE RIGHT WAY All banks are not alike. You may have chosen yours for one good reason, but learn more about your options and you might discover some ways to save money. Here are some things to chew on:  - If you chose a bank due to its location, know that these days, with newfangled inventions like the telephone, direct deposit, the U.S. mail system, and even, dare we say, the Internet, you don't need to be particularly close to a bricks-and-mortar branch of any bank  - A good way to figure out exactly which of a bank's services you most need to pay attention to is to make a list. Jot down the following items on a sheet of lined paper and make three columns, where you enter how much you spent for each category in each of the past three months: ATM surcharges, ""foreign"" ATM fees, other ATM fees, overdrafts, monthly maintenance fees, check printing, deposit/other slips, call center charges, debit card fees, low-balance penalty, per-check charges, return check/NSF fees, money order fees, traveler's checks, and other bank fees. This will help you quickly see where your money is going and what features you should examine when evaluating a bank.  - If you're parking any money in CDs, make sure you look around for the best rates. Check sites such as Bankrate.com and you could end up earning 2 percent more at a small bank a few states away.  Bankrate.com: http://www.lnksrv.com/m.asp?i=497032  - You can often get a higher interest rate on your checking account at a small regional bank than at a big national one. Better still, some discount brokerages are now offering banking services. TD Waterhouse is a good example, offering money market accounts, checking, direct deposit, and more (Waterhouse.com, 800-839-2837).  Waterhouse.com: http://www.lnksrv.com/m.asp?i=497033  - Use direct deposit. It saves time and some banks will give you free checking if you use it.  - Don't order checks from your bank, which might charge as much as $25 for 200. You can get the same thing for a quarter of the price through services such as Currentchecks.com (800-204-2244) or Checksinthemail.com (877-397-1541).

Anyway, this story shows you just how amazing Rudy is after everything that has happened.                                    RUDY KEEPS HIS WORD                                 By KIRSTEN DANIS, DAVID SEIFMAN and BILL HOFFMANN                                                   September 17, 2001 -- Diane                                                   Gorumba of Brooklyn beamed with                                                   pride yesterday as Mayor Giuliani                                                   walked her down the aisle - and                                                   helped erase a nightmarish year of                                                   tragedy for the Brooklyn bride's                                                   family.                                                   The mayor kept a promise he made                                                   last month to Diane, 23, after her                                                   firefighter brother, Michael, who                                                   was supposed to give her away,                                                   died Aug. 28 while fighting a                                                   three-alarm blaze on Staten Island.                                                   ""We will go on. This proves it right                                                   here. The mayor came here - he                                                   thought about us,"" the beaming                                                   newlywed said as she jumped into a                                                   limo with husband, Michael Ferrito,                                                   31, a police officer at the 61st                                                   Precinct.                                                   Diane has already lived through 12                                 months of her own horrors. Her grandfather died Sept. 13,                                 2000, and 17 days later, her dad, an executive at J.P.                                 Morgan Chase, also passed away.                                 With her father gone, she asked her brother, a member of                                 Engine Co. 163, to walk her down the aisle at St. James                                 Lutheran Church in Gerrittsen Beach, and he agreed.                                 Then, the Staten Island fire tragedy took Michael's life.                                 At Michael's funeral, Diane sadly lamented to her mom, Gail,                                 that there was nobody to escort her up to the altar. She                                 half-jokingly turned to the mayor and asked, ""Why don't you                                 do it?""                                 ""I'd be honored,"" Giuliani replied, without missing a beat.                                 Yesterday morning, Giuliani - who has been working round                                 the clock since the Twin Towers horror - said the wedding                                 meant ""a great deal to him.""                                 The mayor recalled asking Gail Gorumba, after her son died,                                 how she has kept going through her grief.                                 ""She feels the pain of it, she allows the pain to happen,""                                 Giuliani said. ""But then she focuses on the good things that                                 are left in life, like her daughter's wedding. I thought about                                 that a good deal of time this week.""                                 The bride and groom's families said they will be eternally                                 grateful to him.                                 ""It meant more than I can ever, ever say. He's the best, and                                 I wish we could re-elect him"" Diane said.                                 As 225 people jammed the quaint 77-year-old church, the                                 mayor gave Diane his left arm.                                 Smiling happily for perhaps the first time since the Tuesday                                 disaster, Giuliani - clad in black tie with a white rose in his                                 lapel - slowly strode down the aisle and brought Diane to the                                 groom.                                 Then he lifted her veil and kissed her on the cheek.                                 As the 30-minute ceremony proceeded, the mayor sat in the                                 front row with the bride's mom. Afterward, Giuliani got into                                 his car to head back to Manhattan, and the serious work at                                 hand.

The mayor kept a promise he made                                                   last month to Diane, 23, after her                                                   firefighter brother, Michael, who                                                   was supposed to give her away,                                                   died Aug. 28 while fighting a                                                   three-alarm blaze on Staten Island.                                                   ""We will go on. This proves it right                                                   here. The mayor came here - he                                                   thought about us,"" the beaming                                                   newlywed said as she jumped into a                                                   limo with husband, Michael Ferrito,                                                   31, a police officer at the 61st                                                   Precinct.                                                   Diane has already lived through 12                                 months of her own horrors. Her grandfather died Sept. 13,                                 2000, and 17 days later, her dad, an executive at J.P.                                 Morgan Chase, also passed away.                                 With her father gone, she asked her brother, a member of                                 Engine Co. 163, to walk her down the aisle at St. James                                 Lutheran Church in Gerrittsen Beach, and he agreed.                                 Then, the Staten Island fire tragedy took Michael's life.                                 At Michael's funeral, Diane sadly lamented to her mom, Gail,                                 that there was nobody to escort her up to the altar. She                                 half-jokingly turned to the mayor and asked, ""Why don't you                                 do it?""                                 ""I'd be honored,"" Giuliani replied, without missing a beat.                                 Yesterday morning, Giuliani - who has been working round                                 the clock since the Twin Towers horror - said the wedding                                 meant ""a great deal to him.""                                 The mayor recalled asking Gail Gorumba, after her son died,                                 how she has kept going through her grief.                                 ""She feels the pain of it, she allows the pain to happen,""                                 Giuliani said. ""But then she focuses on the good things that                                 are left in life, like her daughter's wedding. I thought about                                 that a good deal of time this week.""                                 The bride and groom's families said they will be eternally                                 grateful to him.                                 ""It meant more than I can ever, ever say. He's the best, and                                 I wish we could re-elect him"" Diane said.                                 As 225 people jammed the quaint 77-year-old church, the                                 mayor gave Diane his left arm.                                 Smiling happily for perhaps the first time since the Tuesday                                 disaster, Giuliani - clad in black tie with a white rose in his                                 lapel - slowly strode down the aisle and brought Diane to the                                 groom.                                 Then he lifted her veil and kissed her on the cheek.                                 As the 30-minute ceremony proceeded, the mayor sat in the                                 front row with the bride's mom. Afterward, Giuliani got into                                 his car to head back to Manhattan, and the serious work at                                 hand.

They can find out how best to donate their time."" -- President George W. Bush   ----------------------------------------------------------------- TOP STORY -----------------------------------------------------------------  BOEING TO CUT WORKFORCE Boeing (NYSE: BA), the world's largest manufacturer of commercial jet aircraft, announced late last night that it would reduce employment by 20,000 to 30,000 by the end of 2002, 10% to 15% of its workforce.  >>FULL STORY: http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=497747  ----------------------------------------------------------------- NEWS TO GO -----------------------------------------------------------------  Congress and the Bush Administration continue discussions with airlines over a possible aid package. There are published reports that the President supports a $2.5 billion cash package -- half the airlines' $5 billion cash request -- to assist the airlines with lost revenues from the forced grounding of planes, in addition to loans and loan guarantees. Both the executive and legislative branches reportedly want to provide aid that recognizes the airlines' role in last week's tragedies, but does not assist them in revenue issues associated with the worsening economy. A difficult task, to be sure.  Large pharmaceutical company Bristol-Myers Squibb (NYSE: BMY) reportedly will pay $1 billion for a 19.9% (okay, call it 20%!) stake in biotech cancer drug maker ImClone Systems (Nasdaq: IMCL). The deal would value ImClone at $70 a share, a 40% premium over yesterday's $50.01 close, and earn Bristol-Myers U.S. and Canadian marketing rights to ImClone's proposed monoclonal antibody cancer drug, IMC-C225, now pending Food & Drug Administration approval for colorectal cancer, and in trials for other cancers.  Honeywell (NYSE: HON) said that its Q3 earnings would fall below previous estimates. The large manufacturer projected EPS of $0.43 to $0.45, below Wall Street's $0.53 consensus. The company also said that while its commercial aviation business provides 15% of its revenue, Honeywell remains well diversified and able to weather a downturn in the aviation portion of its operations.  Shares of global telecom giant Cable & Wireless (NYSE: CWP) slumped up to 12% this morning in European trading in response to the company's warning that its first-half revenue dropped as much as 5%. The company cited pricing pressure in voice and data services, adding that it expected revenue for the second half of the year to be off a similar 5%. Shares closed in the U.S. yesterday up $0.25 to $14.06, on the low end of their 52-week range of $13.45 to $45.63. Motley Fool telecom guru Bill Mann covers the company regularly. http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=497748  In other earnings news, Eastman Kodak (NYSE: EK) reduced its Q3 EPS forecast from $0.90-$1.20 to $0.65, Linux software vendor Red Hat (Nasdaq: RHAT) reported a Q2 loss of $0.33 versus last year's $0.12, and Miracle-Gro maker The Scotts Company (NYSE: SMG) lowered FY 2001 EPS projections from $2.33-$2.63 to $2.00-$2.15.  ----------------------------------------------------------------- POST OF THE DAY -----------------------------------------------------------------  INTEL-RAMBUS NEW CONTRACT ""Any remaining tatters of a ""special"" Rambus-Intel relationship seem dead.

The Associated Press, quoting an anonymous administration official, says the cash would be coupled with help for the airlines' insurance liabilities.  The House of Representatives hopes to rush through a $24 billion aid package that will be quickly sent to the Senate, and could possibly reach the president's desk before next week. That package would include loans as well as some cash that would not have to be repaid. Continental Airlines (NYSE: CAL) CEO Gordon Bethune says the industry is currently losing $15 million per hour, and the package is needed to restore some stability to the situation.  In the meantime, more airlines announced staff reductions after the market closed yesterday. First, Mesa Air (Nasdaq: MESA) said it would cut 700 jobs and implement a temporary 10% pay reduction for most employees. Senior management's pay has already been reduced by 20%, and both the CEO and the company's president took a 50% cut.  Later, heavyweights American Airlines parent AMR Corp. (NYSE: AMR) and United Airlines parent UAL (NYSE: UAL) announced layoffs of some 20,000 employees each. That represents 14% of American's staff, and 20% of United's. Following Boeing's (NYSE: BA) actions Wednesday, job cuts now total almost 100,000 people industry wide. http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=499860  One company bucking the layoff trend, however, is SkyWest Airlines (Nasdaq: SKYW). COO Ron Reber says no layoffs are in the works. The company's ""plans for growth are still intact,"" he says, and it still plans to take delivery of the 106 Canadair Regional Jets it ordered from manufacturer Bombardier. SkyWest operates as United Express and Delta Connection in 74 cities.  >>FULL STORY: http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=499861  ----------------------------------------------------------------- NEWS TO GO -----------------------------------------------------------------  Media companies have also been adversely affected by the terrorist attacks. Knight-Ridder (NYSE: KRI) and Tribune Co. (NYSE: TRB), which teamed up in August to acquire online job recruitment site Headhunter.NET (Nasdaq: HHNT), both came out with bad news after the bell yesterday. Knight-Ridder CEO Tony Ridder says many advertisers pulled ads after the attacks, and, combined with the increased expenses due to extended coverage of the tragedy, he expects about a 25% year-over-year drop in earnings per share. Citing the same reasons, Tribune expects third-quarter and full-year earnings to come in below expectations. http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=499862  The Securities and Exchange Commission says it doesn't yet know if those associated with last Tuesday's hijackings also exploited the markets in order to profit from the attacks. The agency says it's ""vigorously pursuing all credible leads,"" but wouldn't release any other details.  Networking equipment maker 3Com (Nasdaq: COMS) reported fiscal first-quarter results that saw revenue fall 58% from the same period last year. The company also ""found opportunities"" to reduce staffing by another 1,000 people and expects to end the quarter with 6,000 workers. It employed 12,000 last November.  The nation's number-two hospital operator, Tenet Healthcare (NYSE: THC), says it will top estimates when it releases fiscal first-quarter earnings on Oct. 3. Its expected earnings per share of $0.65 - $0.67 would represent 35-40% growth over last year.  Rex Moore's mental acuity has shown a 3%-5% year-over-year decrease, though it's up inconsequentially sequentially. At press time he held no positions in any of the companies mentioned in this article.

"The New York City Marathon will take place as scheduled on Sunday, November 4, 2001.  In the wake of the terrible events of September 11, the New York City Marathon will highlight the diversity, energy, and resilience of New York City as never before, said Allan Steinfeld, race director of the New York City Marathon and president and CEO of New York Road Runners.  No course changes are planned, as the five-borough New York City Marathon route does not go near the site of the World Trade Center disaster in lower Manhattan.  Steinfeld added, New York Road Runners is dedicating the 2001 New York City Marathon to the victims of the tragic events of September 11, and to the courageous rescuers who have worked tirelessly to save lives and to rebuild our great city and nation.  Please join New York Road Runners, our sponsors and partners, and runners from around the world in our effort to raise $1 million for the Twin Towers Fund, a united and coordinated effort to assist victims of the September 11 disaster and their families, and the families of the firefighters, police officers, emergency medical technicians, and Port Authority police involved in the rescue and recovery effort.

"   -----Original Message----- From:  ""Colangelo, Maria"" <Maria.Colangelo@ubsw.com>@ENRON   On Behalf Of ""Abramson, Barry"" <Barry.Abramson@ubsw.com> Sent: Monday, September 24, 2001 7:54 AM To: undisclosed-recipients:;@ENRON Subject: Electric Utilities - Weekly Update  KEY POINTS This is our first Weekly Update since the terrorist attacks upon the United States last week.  We wish to express our sympathy for all of the victims and their families.  We also want to express our appreciation for the heroic efforts of all of the rescue workers who put themselves in danger in order to help others.  When the stock markets reopened this week, the utility stocks, in a broad sense, resumed their previous pattern of trading.  Since August, the stocks of companies that have more of the characteristics of traditional utilities have outperformed while the higher-growth electricity companies that are less regulated have been laggards.  These trends continued last week.  Before September 11, the IPP stocks and the utilities with merchant generation, were losing value because of fundamental concerns about lower wholesale power prices.  Also before September 11, the higher yielding, more traditional utilities were gaining in value due to their defensive characteristics that were favored due to the slowing U.S. economy.  After September 11, it appears that investors driven by fear of the unknown and by greater concerns about a recession in the U.S., have looked for safe havens in the higher yielding utility stocks.  Although higher yields are good for a portfolio in a period of market uncertainty, we think that the best values in the electric group are in what we consider to be the over-sold merchant generating stocks, such as PPL Corp. (PPL-$37.00, rated Strong Buy)[2], Duke Energy (DUK-$37.17, rated Strong Buy)[2] and NRG Energy (NRG-$15.50, rated Strong Buy).  We also favor a few of the seemingly over-sold diversified energy/convergence stocks, such as Dominion Resources (D-$58.98, rated Strong Buy)[2] and NiSource (NI-$23.40, rated Strong Buy).   <<WKLY10924.doc>>  <<WKLY10924.pdf>>    - WKLY10924.doc   - WKLY10924.pdf   Visit our website at http://www.ubswarburg.com  This message contains confidential information and is intended only for the individual named.

While its old media peers buckled under a soft ad market and some of its new media peers bowed out completely, AOL Time Warner stood firm.  >>FULL STORY: http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=502955  ----------------------------------------------------------------- NEWS TO GO -----------------------------------------------------------------  While we can all use a good massage about now, here's the rub: Most of Steiner Leisure's (Nasdaq: STNR) spa services take place afloat on cruise ships, and vacationers are putting off their bon voyages. Steiner is now talking down third and fourth quarter projections. The company, which also sells its own line of spa products and runs a few massage schools, feels it has a good grip on its long-term fundamentals. Unfortunately, the bad news in the near term is sure to rub Wall Street the wrong way.  Flat is where it's at. Flat panel display maker Kopin (Nasdaq: KOPN) bucked the trend by raising its third-quarter projections. Strong demand for its III-V and CyberDisplay imaging devices has the company expecting a 25% sequential increase in revenue and a loss of $0.15 to $0.17 a share. That's on the low end of analyst estimates.  Recession-resistant and sometimes even caffeine free, soda investors can have a Coke (NYSE: KO) and a smile this morning as the carbonated fizz giant is on target to meet its 2001 marks. Thanks to robust consumption in the Asia and Africa markets the company expects volume growth to come in between 4% and 5% this year.  Free in flight, AMR (NYSE: AMR) Chariman Donald Carty announced that he would forgo all compensation -- including his salary -- for the rest of the year. Given the troubled state of the airline industry in general, and AMR's American Airlines in particular, it's more a token gesture than a way to reverse the company's possible billion-dollar shortfall this year.  There is no easy chair in the office furniture industry. With sales falling 25% over the past year and orders off by a third, Herman Miller (Nasdaq: MLHR) reported earnings before charges of $0.04 a share. While that is in line with analyst projections, it comes after the company had to talk down earnings twice. Originally the company was expected to report profits of $0.40 a share -- essentially what it had earned the year before. Herman Miller also announced that it would be letting 2,600 employees go, which poses the question: What will the company do with all that office furniture?  ----------------------------------------------------------------- POST OF THE DAY -----------------------------------------------------------------  THE WEEKEND ""I have been reading for days now that economists are worried about ""consumer confidence"", that a recession is ""inevitable"".

After the bell yesterday, the company reported a fourth-quarter loss of $576 million, or $0.96 a share. Revenue plummeted 79% year-over-year to $480 million. Full-year numbers for fiscal 2001 show a loss of $0.88 a share on revenue of $3.9 billion.  >>FULL STORY: http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=503822  ----------------------------------------------------------------- NEWS TO GO -----------------------------------------------------------------  Second-quarter earnings were a bit bubblier for Bed Bath & Beyond (Nasdaq: BBBY). Not only did the home products retailer increase revenue by 21% from the same period last year, it also saw same-store sales rise by 4.8% and maintained its earlier guidance for the second half of the year.  There's nothing fowl about Tyson Foods' (NYSE: TSN) fourth quarter. The king o' chicken raised its estimates for the quarter to $0.18 to $0.22 a share, which is significantly higher than its previous guidance of $0.08 to $0.12.  AES Corporation (NYSE: AES), one of the world's top power producers, powered down its full-year earnings estimates in a big way. Blaming a weakening Brazilian Real, a decline in electricity prices in England, and the economy, the Virginia-based company now expects to earn $1.25-$1.45 per share for all of 2001. That's some 20%-30% below estimates.  Textron (NYSE: TXT) this morning reduced its outlook for the second half of the year and said it would have to cut 2,500 more jobs and take large restructuring charges. The maker of Bell helicopters, Cessna planes, and industrial products blamed the softening economy and the September 11 tragedy for many of its woes.  Expect Vans (Nasdaq: VANS) to pull to the side of the road for the next quarter. Although the ""extreme sports"" apparel retailer reported record first-quarter sales and earnings after the bell yesterday, it said its second quarter would fall short of expectations. CEO Gary Schoenfeld blamed a sharp slowdown caused by the September 11 terrorist attacks.  And on this day in 1774, Jonathan Chapman was born in Leominister, Massachusetts. This apple farmer pioneered the Microsoft (Nasdaq: MSFT) method of giving away the product in order to gain marketshare. Chapman was better known as Johnny Appleseed. http://www.lnksrv.com/m.asp?i=503823  ----------------------------------------------------------------- POST OF THE DAY -----------------------------------------------------------------  TRUST ""...I bumped into an old friend so often ignored in business -- Trust.

"Chobs: Sorry it took so long to respond, but its been crazy around here.  Both KMI and KMP are still good buys, its just the overall market environment thats bringing these down.  Also, the commodities prices in gas and crude and fuel oil have come off quite a bit, which makes the general investors worry about the future earnings potential of the companies.  They are locked into contracts at a very good price, so whether the price of the commodity goes up or down they still make their cash flow targets.  Remember, the CEO of the company has a stack of over 25% of the company, so he is very tied to the overall stock price.  Enough said, invest your money into KMI and KMP, especially KMP since it has that yield of around 7%.  Talk to you soon.

At P/E multiples of barely above 8x our 2002 estimates, we regard this as an attractive opportunity. How are the AES issues different? * AES earnings shortfall mostly from outside U.S.:  The two single-largest components of the shortfall were the weak Brazilian currency and weak U.K. power prices.  Very little of the shortfall was attributable to U.S. businesses.  CPN, NRG and MIR derive the vast majority of their income from the U.S.  We do not see any negative implications for the global businesses of any of these companies; see specific comments below. * Market leader disappointment a more significant factor:  The poor performance of companies like Enron and AES this year has been a major negative to psychology, even though many of the issues these companies have been challenged by (global, broadband) are not endemic to the sector. What continues to bother these stocks? * Investor concerns about potential oversupply have been accentuated by the events of September 11.  That is because power demand growth is likely to slow, perhaps to 0%-1% from 2%, in a U.S. recession.  If planned supply additions are unchanged, this could hasten the arrival of an ?overbuild.? * Weak equity valuations make equity issuance extremely unattractive and unlikely.  Inability to raise equity calls into question the ability to complete capacity expansion plans, which have been the key driver of earnings growth. Stocks look cheap, but what are the potential catalysts? * Scaling back of capacity expansion plans:  We expect to see project cancellations and/or deferrals, particularly those targeted for commercial operation in 2003-2005.  The capital markets discipline currently being exerted makes this almost inevitable, in our view.  We are aware that a number of companies are undertaking reviews at present of all projects that have not yet broken ground.  Removing some of the more marginal projects would reduce the risk of overbuild in 2003.  The 80,000 Mw proposed for that year could be scaled back to about 50,000 Mw. * Investor comfort with revised growth targets:  As part of this process, managements are likely to begin talking lower growth rates for the 2003-2005 period. We expect these to remain solidly double-digit, and still well   - IPPs092701.pdf ",benjamin.rogers@enron.com,jaime.gualy@enron.com,"FW: Parrella-IPPs- Reiterating Ratings on CPN, NRG, MIR",2001-09-27 06:05:33-07:00,received

That's well below Wall Street's expectations for sales and earnings of $54.4 million and $0.01 per share, respectively. Sonus will also take charges up to $466 million.  Allegiance Telecom (Nasdaq: ALGX), a competitive local-exchange carrier, reported disappointing third-quarter results yesterday, citing the short-term impact of the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11. The company expects revenue of $135 million, well below Wall Street's expectation of $147.2 million. Allegiance also lowered its 2001 revenue target 5% below its previous expectation of $550 million, but maintained full-year earnings guidance.  Guitar Center (Nasdaq: GTRC) was playing the warning blues yesterday when the music retailer announced that its third-quarter sales and earnings would fall short of Wall Street's expectations. Guitar Center expects sales between $219 million and $222 million, with earnings of $0.04 to $0.06 per share, versus Wall Street's current expectation of $0.16 per share. The company attributed its disappointing results to the terrorist attacks, which hurt sales.  Enterasys Networks (NYSE: ETS), which makes network equipment such as routers and switches, reported second-quarter pro forma earnings of $23.1 million, or $0.11 per share, compared with earnings of $10.2 million, or $0.05 per share, in the year-ago quarter. Wall Street's consensus expectation called for earnings of $0.10 per share.

The new range is $4.30-$4.45.  Importantly, this number includes absorbing costs for increased severance and a telecom write-off.  For 2002, the company is not providing any outlook, but notes concern over economic weakness. * While EXC?s earnings are somewhat protected from lower power prices with roughly 60-70% of its generation sold to its own retail customers, the other 30-40% is sold into the wholesale markets.  EXC?s low-cost nuclear plants insure that these sales are profitable, but the rapid decline in gas prices and associated drop in power prices will reduce these profits below expectations. * In addition, EXC management is concerned about signs of weakening retail demand post the September 11 tragedy, particularly in Chicago. * We are lowering our 2001E to $4.35/share to reflect these issues.  For 2002, EXC will still see a $0.43/share benefit from the elimination of goodwill amortization.  Moreover, we expect less one-time items and losses at Enterprises and cost cuts at distribution to help earnings.  However, we now assume mid-to-high $20 prices for wholesale and only modest retail growth (1%).  Our new 2002E number is now $5.00/share. * Our lower rating reflects less conviction on earnings and concern over how EXC can implement its strategic consolidation plan with a lower stock currency.  However, the stock trades at only 10x our reduced earnings outlook and the company remains a low-cost producer with a significant retail hedge.  Once the dust settles, we expect the stock to return to an average group multiple of around 9x, implying a mid $40s stock price.   - EXC092701_F..pdf ",benjamin.rogers@enron.com,jaime.gualy@enron.com,FW: Fleishman-EXC- Ratings Reduced on Lower Earnings,2001-09-27 09:27:17-07:00,received

The PC industry was struggling well before last month's terrorist attacks, but now demand has come to a screeching halt.  >>FULL STORY: http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=508218  ----------------------------------------------------------------- NEWS TO GO -----------------------------------------------------------------  Home is where the VCR is. Video rental chain Hollywood Entertainment (Nasdaq: HLYW) is raising its third-quarter profit projections after homebody consumers contributed to a stunning 11% uptick in same store sales. Second only to Blockbuster (NYSE: BBI) in size with 1800 locations, Hollywood is now expecting to earn between $0.15 and $0.17 a share, seven cents above earlier estimates.  Publisher McGraw-Hill (NYSE: MHP) was supposed to be a textbook case of down market resiliency given its steady scholastic endeavors. However, as a magazine and trade journal maker, the company has its work cut out for it in this lax advertising climate. After growing revenue by 11% through the first half of the year, the McGraw Hill is looking at sales growth in the high single digits for the latter part of the year. With many of its properties like BusinessWeek and the Standard & Poor's debt rating service in the financial information field, market apathy has also hit the company hard.  Always low prices. Always moving forward, Wal-Mart (NYSE: WMT) announced that it would be accelerating its Supercenter expansion plans. The leading retailer, which yesterday reiterated its 4% same store sales gain targets for the month of September, plans to open or relocate 235 outlets in fiscal 2002. It's a move that would grow the discount department store and wholesale club chains by 9% for the year.  I choose not to, Pikachu! Given the lack of kiddies no longer interested in exchanging Charmander trading cards for Bulbasaurs and Meowths, Topps (Nasdaq: TOPP) reported sales of $81.7 million for the quarter, well behind last year's $141.7 million sum. Once better known for its sport cards franchises, if you want to know how big Pokemon once was, consider that non-Pokemon sales actually increased during the period. Earnings came in at $0.20 a share, off last year's $0.68 a share showing but actually a penny ahead of Wall Street's prediction. On deck for Topps? Lord of the Rings and Monsters, Inc. trading cards, to coincide with the highly anticipated theatrical releases later this year.  Hardly news anymore, but somebody else is now suing Microsoft (Nasdaq: MSFT). This time it is the once mighty network maven Novell (Nasdaq: NOVL). The company is taking Microsoft to court on the grounds of false advertising after the company shipped marketing material to Novell customers in the form of cereal boxes. Microsoft Server Crunch, seemingly the breakfast of software champions, stated that Novell was moving out of software development -- a claim Novell says is not true. I wonder if there was a toy surprise inside?  ----------------------------------------------------------------- POST OF THE DAY -----------------------------------------------------------------  HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE OF THE MARKET ""...my grandmother was the daughter of the principle lab assistant who helped Guglielmo Marconi, Nobel Prize winner in physics in 1909, invent the radio.

The company will cut another 20,000 jobs and expects a lowered $3.5 billion in Q3 revenue to produce a $3.6 billion -- or $1.13 a share -- loss.  >>FULL STORY: http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=508939  ----------------------------------------------------------------- NEWS TO GO -----------------------------------------------------------------  Private Rx help. Drug behemoth GlaxoSmithKline (NYSE: GSK) will reportedly announce today a national discount program for low-income elderly individuals without prescription drug coverage. An orange card would entitle holders to receive discounts of 25% and higher for the drugs outside of hospitals at most pharmacies. The company's move could be an effort to head off government prescription coverage for the elderly, while the price cuts could help the company's drugs better compete. GlaxoSmithKline makes such well-known products as asthma treatment Flovent, anti-depressant Paxil, and diabetes drug Avandia.  Revenue depressant. Big drug maker Eli Lilly (NYSE: LLY) warned this morning that while its Q3 EPS remain on track at $0.66, Q4 EPS are likely to fall to between $0.59 and $0.61. The Street had expected Q4 numbers of $0.65. The change is due to the decline in revenues for Lilly's blockbuster antidepressant Prozac, which lost patent protection in August. To bolster its drug pipeline, Lilly recently made a strategic investment in Isis Pharmaceuticals (Nasdaq: ISIP) ( profiled in a recent issue of The Motley Fool Select). Lilly shares closed yesterday at $82.87, with a 52-week range of $70.01-$97.13. http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=508940 http://www.lnksrv.com/m.asp?i=508941  Flexing muscles despite smaller diet. Contract manufacturer Flextronics (Nasdaq: FLEX) continues its expansion with the purchase of half of Xerox's manufacturing operations for $220 million. President Michael Marks reportedly told investors at a conference on Sept. 10 that the company's new deals would lead to a 40% revenue increase this fiscal year -- despite such roadblocks as a slowdown in its deal with Motorola (NYSE: MOT). Earlier this year, Sweden's Ericsson (Nasdaq: ERICY) chose Singapore-based Flextronics as its manufacturer, and Microsoft (Nasdaq: MSFT) also signed up with the company for the upcoming X-Box game console. http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=508942  Caught in the Crossairs? U.S. airlines aren't alone in their suffering. Switzerland's pride and joy Swissair filed for protection from creditors and grounded its planes after a bank-led bailout failed to solve its financial woes. Some reports lay the blame at the feet of the country's number one bank UBS (NYSE: UBS), which joined Credit Suisse with a $168 million cash infusion Tuesday, but apparently too late to please Swissair's suppliers. That deal also plans to turn Swissair's 70%-owned Crossair regional unit into a smaller national airline. Belgium's Sabena, 49.5% owned by Swissair, has filed for bankruptcy after Swissair failed to come through with new cash. http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=508943  ----------------------------------------------------------------- POST OF THE DAY -----------------------------------------------------------------  BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY'S FLOAT ""In short, float is cheap capital. That is, it's the ability to use money at a cost less than you'd normally have to pay (e.g. interest on a loan), and less than the return you can earn on that money. Of course, it's possible to generate ""float"" that actually costs you more than other sources of capital, but a better description of that circumstance would be ""high interest loan,"" since the word float really connotes some benefit to the recipient.""  >>FULL POST: http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=508944  =================================================================  SPONSORED BY: Sharebuilder Buy stocks for just $3!

After the market closed yesterday, the troubled computer maker warned investors that it would lose $0.14 to $0.17 a share in the third quarter, excluding special charges. It had previously expected to lose only $0.04 a share.  >>FULL STORY: http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=510987  ----------------------------------------------------------------- NEWS TO GO -----------------------------------------------------------------  In a moving statement yesterday, eSpeed (Nasdaq: ESPD) chairman and CEO Howard Lutnick announced his firm's shares will resume trading today. eSpeed is the electronic brokerage subsidiary of Cantor Fitzgerald, which lost more than 730 employees when the World Trade Center was attacked. ""eSpeed will never forget, never settle, and never give up,"" said Lutnick. ""It is our promise that this company will stand as a testament to those we have lost and a badge of honor to those who have survived."" http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=510988  Starbucks (Nasdaq: SBUX) stock sweetened up more than 10% in after-hours trading after the company said it's sticking with its fiscal 2001 target of $0.46 a share. The world's top coffee retailer saw same-store sales for the five weeks ended Sept. 30 increase 1% despite the fact all its shops in North America were closed early on Sept. 11. Starbucks Chairman and Chief Global Strategist Howard Schultz even said the current economic conditions ""provide a favorable environment to aggressively pursue our global expansion strategy.""  Another company reaffirming its quarterly target was Tommy Hilfiger (NYSE: TOM). The trendy clothing retailer said its fiscal second quarter should meet expectations, but ""in light of continuing economic weakness and the impact on consumer confidence"" caused by the terrorist attacks, the company is lowering its full-year EPS target. CEO Joel Horowitz said he's particularly concerned about the holiday season.  Advanced Micro Devices (NYSE: AMD) said early this morning that third-quarter sales would come in around $766 million, a decline of 22% from the second quarter. The chip maker expected only a 15% sequential decline. Chief executive W.J. Sanders III said average selling prices for PC processors fell sharply in the face of ""very aggressive competition,"" but believes his company maintained, or even gained, market share.  Grocery giants Safeway (NYSE: SWY) and Albertson's (NYSE: ABS) are teaming up in a lawsuit against the United Food and Commercial Workers labor union. The two companies say the UFCS ""engaged in blatant voting irregularities'' in a vote to approve a new labor contract. According to the lawsuit, some union locals are attempting to kill the contract offer by various means, including denying some employees the chance to vote and allowing others to vote twice.  Standard & Poor's said yesterday that Teco Energy (NYSE: TE) will be added to the S&P 500 Index next week. Teco will replace Global Crossing (NYSE: GX), which is getting the boot due to ""lack of representation."" Global is trading at just over $1 a share.  With an upper deck shot in the 9th inning in Houston, San Francisco outfielder Barry Bonds hit his 70th home run of the year last night, tying Mark McGwire's single-season record. Bonds will have a chance to break the record at home now, as the Giants close out the season with a three-game series against arch-rival Los Angeles, beginning tonight.  ----------------------------------------------------------------- POST OF THE DAY -----------------------------------------------------------------  MORNINGSTAR ON QCOM ""The report offers one criticism of QCOM which I thought did make sense, and which I haven't seen any discussion of on this board, and that has to do with the accounting framework which QCOM prefers to report trends in earnings and expenses. In particular, the frequency and regularity of one-time charges taken struck me as suspect. Since QCOM excludes these charges from its customary pro-forma income statements, the growth in earnings gets overstated, and the growth in expenses and related costs understated. In some cases, the differences between the pro-forma and GAAP statements for the same quarter are exceptionally large.""  >>FULL POST: http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=510989  =================================================================  SPONSORED BY: IBD Sign up for two FREE weeks of Investor's Business Daily and learn how to use this valuable source of investor information with an online tutorial from the Fool. http://www.lnksrv.com/m.asp?i=510990  =================================================================  My Portfolio: http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=510991 My Discussion Boards: http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=510992   WANNA TAKE THE SHORTCUT?

On Friday, Newport News Shipbuilding (NYSE: NNS) said it may receive a buyout proposal from Northrop Grumman (NYSE: NOC) that beats General Dynamics' (NYSE: GD) current offer. http://www.lnksrv.com/m.asp?i=511723  Paul Larson in early May reported that Newport, a maker of nuclear-powered Naval vessels -- agreed to sell to defense contractor General Dynamics for $67.50 per share in cash. It looked to be a happy ending to a long-running soap opera: The companies were set to merge in 1999 before Newport, unhappy with the buyout price and concerned about regulatory problems, balked. http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=511724  Those problems seemed taken care of earlier this year -- but there was still the matter of Northrop, which tried to divert Newport News with a similar offer that, because it contained less cash than did General Dynamics', didn't get the job done with Newport News.  This time Northrop hopes to be successful. According to a Newport News press release, a revitalized offer from Northrop is worth approximately $72.67 per share, and that was enough to get the companies back around the negotiating table.  The talks are just talks -- and with the new offer potentially a superior one, Newport News would be remiss in its duty to stockholders were it not to consider it -- but it appears that the intrigue in the defense business is heating up again. (Two Fools debated the merit of defense stocks in last week's Dueling Fools feature.) http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=511725   >>FULL STORY: http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=511726  ----------------------------------------------------------------- NEWS TO GO -----------------------------------------------------------------  Office supply retailer Staples (Nasdaq: SPLS) said it is reportedly liquidating its stock of PCs to lower inventory as the market for computers continues to slow. The company will then focus on build-to-order. ""Stocked computers are a relatively low margin category for us,"" a Staples spokesman told Reuters, ""and they do take up valuable shelf and stockroom space which we could use for other products.""  Enron (NYSE: ENE) agreed to sell its Portland General Electric utility subsidiary to Northwest Natural Gas (NYSE: NWN) in a deal that will include, among other things, $1.55 billion in cash, a total of $250 million in preferred and common stock, and other considerations. The deal is expected to close by the end of last year. Jeffrey Skilling surprised Enron investors when he up and left the company back in August. http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=511727  Compaq (NYSE: CPQ) announced a five-year deal to provide IT services to GE Aircraft Engines, a division of General Electric (NYSE: GE) in North and South America. The deal, which extends a current pact, is worth $95 million.  Apple Computer (Nasdaq: APPL) continues to open retail stores as it looks for ways to market its products effectively to consumers. Stores in New York and Germantown, Tenn., were announced today, while a Palo Alto, Calif., store was announced last week. (Mike Trigg visited Apple's first store back in May.) http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=511728  Sausage and restaurant company Bob Evans Farms (Nasdaq: BOBE) said it sold its Hickory Farms smoke flavorings subsidiary to Irish company Kerry Farms for an undisclosed cash sum. The company expects a one-time gain of between $0.08 and $0.10 per share in its fiscal second quarter ended Oct. 26. The proceeds will be used to repurchase shares and pay off short-term debt.  Dave Marino-Nachison owns shares of General Electric. More importantly, he congratulates the U.S. Men's Soccer Team for qualifying for next year's World Cup.

Dour economy or not, we continue to move toward a cashless society and electronic payment specialist First Data (NYSE: FDC) is leading the charge. The country's leading processor of credit card transactions, as well as the parent company of Western Union, reported operating earnings of $0.69 a share. That surpassed even the highest of the analyst estimates as the company trounced the consensus projections calling for a $0.69 a share showing.  >>FULL STORY: http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=512590  ----------------------------------------------------------------- NEWS TO GO -----------------------------------------------------------------  Home stocks, sweet home stocks. Housemaker D.R. Horton (NYSE: DHI) reported record backlog levels as net sales orders surpassed the billion-dollar mark for the fourth quarter. Given the buoyant real estate market and dirt-cheap mortgage rates, it was no problem for the company to drum up orders for 22,179 houses through the entire fiscal year.  Benchmark Electronics (NYSE: BHE) is comfortable with its benchmark. The Texan-based maker of electronic parts for various components announced that it would meet consensus cash earnings estimates for the third quarter. However, not immune to weakening demand, the company will be taking a $50 million to $60 million charge in an effort to downsize and consolidate its operations.  Give me an earnings sign. Hit me baby one more time. Pepsi Bottling Group (NYSE: PBG), months deep into its Britney Spears marketing campaign, did what any thirsty soul would do with a bottle of Pepsi -- it topped it. The company reported earnings of $0.96 a share before a one-time tax gain, a penny ahead of market expectations. With a 3% increase in worldwide case volume, the world's largest Pepsi seller also reiterated its comfort with analysts' targets of $1.87 in earnings for the year.  The red ink will run south for the Borders (NYSE: BGP) bookstore chain. Due to soft comps since the September 11 attacks, the retailer is now expecting to report a loss of $0.04 a share for its fiscal third quarter. That's three cents steeper than Wall Street was expecting. The company remains ""hopeful"" that the seasonally strong holiday shopping period will pan out, but it's not ready to commit to turning the page to reveal this year's ending just yet.  It seems that Fair, Isaac & Company (NYSE: FIC) was a good credit risk after all. The California company, which develops credit scoring systems for the consumer credit industry, is looking to top fourth-quarter forecasts calling for earnings of $0.55 a share. The company now expects to earn $0.56 a share on revenue of nearly $90 million. Last year the company earned just $0.39 a share on a $78.7 million top-line performance.  Sometimes, it's hard to make the rent. Housestuffs lender Rent-A-Center (Nasdaq: RCII) will miss its quarterly profit targets despite healthy store-level sales growth. The company, which rents out home appliances, computers, and furniture, is looking at earnings between $0.50 and $0.52 a share. Last week the projections were running as high as $0.70 a share. While the company had a decent 4.6% uptick in same store comps, the increased traffic was due to margin-crunching sales promotions. Rent-A-Center had been a solid performer through the years by taking advantage of a fragmented rental market to build out a chain that is now nearly 2300 units strong. For now, though, the company's leader may be leasing out a recliner: Chairman and CEO Ernest Talley announced his retirement, effective immediately.  Rick Aristotle Munarriz believes that breakfast is the most important meal of the day. So eat up! His suggestion for today is apple French toast. Insert sweetened stewed apple slices into thick loaf bread, batter, and pan fry. Then cover with caramel maple syrup. Rick's stock holdings can be viewed online, as can the Fool's disclosure policy.  ----------------------------------------------------------------- POST OF THE DAY -----------------------------------------------------------------  SAMSUNG AND RAMBUS ""This has to be very troubling news for the memory manufactures betting heavily on DDR. This graph clearly shows that Samsung expects 4i RDRAM to actually become smaller than DDR in the very near future, with the exception of 8-bit wide DDR devices.

"   -----Original Message----- From:  ""Russo, Brian"" <Brian.Russo@ubsw.com>@ENRON   On Behalf Of ""Abramson, Barry"" <Barry.Abramson@ubsw.com> Sent: Monday, October 15, 2001 6:45 AM To: undisclosed-recipients:;@ENRON Subject: Electric Utilities:  Weekly Report  KEY POINTS * It is like being in the eye of a hurricane as we wait to have quarterly earnings reports come pouring in.  So far only one company, NRG Energy (NRG-$19.05, rated Strong Buy), a pure play IPP, has reported earnings, and the quarter was slightly better than expected.  NRG also reaffirmed its full year 2001 and 2002 EPS guidance. * Based upon the number of favorable preannouncements that greatly outnumbered the number of negative preannouncements, we remain confident that the third quarter reports should be relatively strong for most electric utilities and IPPs. * We continue to recommend an overweighting in the electric stocks.  In an environment of economic slowdown and falling interest rates, utility stocks should perform relatively well. * In addition, utility stocks still appear undervalued based upon historic valuation measures.  Utility stocks are now trading at an average P/E ratio of 10.5x estimated 2002 EPS compared with a 2002 P/E ratio of 22.7x for the S&P 500. The relative P/E ratio of 0.46x is well below the 25-year historic normal range of 0.60x-0.80x. * American Electric Power (AEP-$44.08, rated Buy)[2] agreed to acquire two huge coal-fired power plants in the U.K. from Edison International (EIX-$15.34, rated Buy)[2].  EIX's subsidiary, Edison Mission Energy, sold the Fiddler's Ferry and Ferrybridge power plants, each one 2,000 MW in size, for a big loss.  Since the time when EIX bought the two power plants in 1999, power prices in the U.K. have fallen sharply and the country is now oversupplied with electric power.  Power prices are expected to remain low in the U.K. for quite a while.  AEP agreed to pay $960 million for the power plants and certain fuel supplies.  For AEP, the purchase price for the power plants is about $200 per kilowatt. Edison International paid about twice as much when it purchased the plants in 1999.  EIX said that it intends to take an after-tax write-off of about $1.18 billion to reflect the loss on the asset sale and related currency adjustments. * Niagara Mohawk Power (NMK-$17.75, rated Buy)[2], National Grid Group, the Staff of the New York Public Service Commission and several other parties, announced a settlement that includes a rate plan for ten years following the proposed merger of NMK and National Grid.  Under the agreement, Niagara Mohawk would reduce rates for electricity delivery by $160 million, or 8%, upon closing of the merger.  Following this one-time rate cut, delivery charges would remain stable for the next ten years.  The settlement is based upon a 10.6% return on equity with an earnings sharing plan.  The plan allows NMK to retain 100% of earnings up to an 11.75% ROE with sharing for earnings above an 11.75% ROE. The plan also allows NMK to retain 50% of merger-related savings and the ROE sharing plan does not include the retained savings.  The agreement also requires NMK to give up recovery of $850 million of nuclear-related stranded costs.  The Public Service Commission is expected to vote on the settlement by late 2001.  We would expect the state regulators to approve the settlement and to approve the merger at the same time.  The merger is expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2002. * Now it appears that Public Service of New Mexico (PNM-$26.71, rated Hold) has decided to go to court to terminate its pending acquisition of Western Resources' utility business (WR-$17.12, rated Hold)[2].  On Friday, PNM issued a press release saying that PNM had asked a court in New York to resolve the disagreement between PNM and WR regarding the merger.  PNM is asking the court ""to find that it is impossible to complete the proposed transaction under the original terms.""  PNM also wants the court to rule that the electric rate reduction imposed by regulators in Kansas provides sufficient cause to terminate the merger agreement.  The CEO of PNM also said that PNM believes that the current agreement must be restructured if there is any chance of the merger going ahead.  However, WR has demanded that the original transaction be pursued even though certain rulings by state regulators in Kansas appear to make this nearly impossible.  PNM and Western had agreed previously that WR had to complete its corporate separation plan, separating its utility operations from its nonutility businesses, before the merger could be completed.  However, the regulators in Kansas refused to approve the terms of WR's corporate separation plan and they have ordered a halt to the implementation of the separation plan.  Kansas regulators want changes to be made to the corporate separation plan in order to provide a stronger balance sheet for the utility post separation. * The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) approved the acquisition of PowerGen of the U.K. by German utility E.On last week.  Also last week, regulators in the state of Virginia approved the acquisition.  Previously, the state of Kentucky also approved the deal.  The approvals from FERC, Virginia and Kentucky were needed because PowerGen owns LG&E Energy, the U.S. electric utility that serves most of Kentucky and a portion of Virginia.  The SEC still needs to approve the merger, which is expected to be completed in the spring of 2002.  We expect E.On to use this deal as a springboard toward making several other acquisitions of U.S. utilities.  Right next door to LG&E Energy is one of our top takeover candidates, Cinergy Corp. (CIN-$31.90, rated Strong Buy). * Utility stocks lagged the overall market last week.  For the five trading days last week, electric utility stocks went down in value by 3.9% compared with a gain of 1.9% for the S&P 500.  IPP stocks had a strong week, with an average stock appreciation of 8.2%  <<WKLY11015.doc>>   - WKLY11015.doc   Visit our website at http://www.ubswarburg.com  This message contains confidential information and is intended only for the individual named.

Kimberly-Clark (NYSE: KMB) announced that it would be missing its quarterly mark. While its preliminary third-quarter take has revenue climbing by 5% over last year, it now expects operating earnings per share to come in at just $0.80 a share. That's off last year's $0.84 a share showing and a nickel below Wall Street's estimates.  >>FULL STORY: http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=518446  ----------------------------------------------------------------- NEWS TO GO -----------------------------------------------------------------  If you want to find out what The Rock is cooking this weekend, you'll need more than DirecTV. After sparring over how to split up pay-per-view revenue since their contract expired earlier this year, World Wrestling Federation (NYSE: WWF) and the Hughes' (NYSE: GMH) owned DirecTV have decided to part ways. Starting with Sunday night's No Mercy presentation, the wrestling performance will not be made available to DirecTV subscribers.  In a New York minute, Central Parking's (NYSE: CPC) earnings outlook can change. The parking lot operator, which has been an aggressive consolidator in its fragmented sector, has felt the pinch of empty parking spaces since last month's terrorist attacks. The company, which oversees 1.5 million parking spaces worldwide, is looking at fiscal fourth-quarter earnings per share to come in between a dime and $0.14. The analysts -- following the company as closely as a mall driver behind someone heading out of the stores -- were expecting the September quarter results to come in closer to $0.21 a share.  When you're a semiconductor production equipment maker, the bright side is often a paler shade of gray. Novellus Systerms (NVLS) announced quarterly bookings of just $124 million, well below its summer forecasts of $160 million, yet still managed to meet analyst targets of $0.24 in earnings per share. While proclaiming weakness in every region and thinner gross margins, Novellus is comfortable with fourth-quarter projections given its cost-shaving strategy. While the company has implemented salary cuts it is one of the few tech players to have skirted the layoff process.  One is the loneliest number, and B2B's fallen hero Commerce One (Nasdaq: CMRC) is getting closer to that number in terms of headcount. The e-commerce software specialist will be cutting its payroll by 1300 employees -- 46% of its workforce. Seven hundred of those will be laid off while another 600 will be part of the company's attempt to spin-off some of its service operations. With minority shareholder SAP announcing that it has no intentions of swallowing the 80% of the company it does not presently own, Commerce One's mounting losses are troubling for the company as an independent.  Pro-forma profits have been cut in half but Unisys (NYSE: UIS) marches on. The e-business solutions provider met Wall Street's reduced $0.07 a share profit number -- a figure which was as high as $0.18 a share just last month. Backing out currency fluctuations, revenue came in essentially flat from year-ago levels. Recognizing its deteriorating margin levels, the company will be aggressively cutting costs in the current quarter. The move will include doing away with 3,000 jobs.  ----------------------------------------------------------------- POST OF THE DAY -----------------------------------------------------------------  MY BERKSHIRE ""I bought my first Berkshire shares a few years ago with the money that my grandmother left me in her will.

Well, a friendly takeover involves one company agreeing to be bought by another. Managers from each firm will typically meet with each other and freely share information about themselves. As you might imagine, in a hostile takeover, the acquisition target is not too thrilled or cooperative.  In a hostile takeover, a would-be acquirer typically sees some strategic value in another company. It may make friendly overtures and be rebuffed. If so, it may then move on to dealing directly with the target's shareholders, by offering to buy their shares from them for either a certain amount in cash, or an exchange of stock. If enough shareholders respond, the acquirer can gain control. In order to entice shareholders, the offer will certainly be for a price significantly higher than the target's current stock price. Note that companies whose share prices have slumped are extra-vulnerable to takeovers.  Some high-profile hostile takeover bids have included IBM for Lotus, Johnson & Johnson for Cordis, and Hilton for ITT.

A strong dollar can cause trouble for companies with extensive international operations, such as Procter & Gamble or McDonald's. That's because they'll get fewer dollars for their rubles and pesos and francs when they exchange currency -- and fewer dollars means lower earnings.  ----------------------------------------------------------------- THIS WEEK'S LESSON  THE HIGH COST OF SMOKING It might seem strange to see an article on quitting smoking in a financial feature. But in many ways, smoking is a very financial enterprise.  For example, companies obviously profit from the tobacco business. We're also used to hearing about all the health risks associated with smoking -- such as the fact that smoking accounts for at least 30 percent of all cancer deaths (according to the American Cancer Society, at cancer.org). The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimate that health care expenditures caused directly by smoking totaled $50 billion in 1993, $10 billion paid by Medicare. http://www.lnksrv.com/m.asp?i=518563  A more Foolish way to address the cost of smoking, though, is to examine its immediate price tag. Imagine that you're 35 years old, you smoke one pack a day, and each pack costs you, on average, about $3. Multiply $3 by 365 days, and you're looking at an annual cost of $1,095. Let's see what would happen if you took this $1,095 and invested it in the stock market, earning the historical average return of 11 percent per year. In 30 years, you'd have $25,067. If you invested $1,095 in the market *each year* for 30 years, you'd end up with a whopping $241,900. Yowza.  Those who would like to quit should know that there are more resources available to you today than ever before, most notably online. For example, we recently opened a ""Quitting Smoking"" discussion board. In less than a year, it's received roughly 8,000 posts from people who have quit or are interested in quitting. These folks are continually supporting and encouraging each other, and many end their posts with this unique kind of signature: ""Matt. Two days, 4 hours, 23 minutes and 19 seconds. 43 cigarettes not smoked, saving $7.09. Life saved: 3 hours, 35 minutes."" And ""Helen. Eight months,two days, 16 hours, 41 minutes and 10 seconds. 9,867 cigarettes not smoked, saving $1,480.17. Life saved: 4 weeks, 6 days, 6 hours, 15 minutes."" http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=518564  For more information and support on quitting smoking, visit silkquit.com.

Revenue hit $9.32 billion, 6.4% ahead of last year's pro forma $8.76 billion. Analysts had been expecting $9.14 billion, following AOL's warning on September 25 that revenue would only grow 5-7%.  >>FULL STORY: http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=519461  ----------------------------------------------------------------- NEWS TO GO -----------------------------------------------------------------  Who says October is bad for stocks? Earnings releases from tech bellwethers Intel (Nasdaq: INTC) and IBM (NYSE: IBM) are expected to lead the markets higher today. Chip manufacturer Intel last night reported that third-quarter revenue dropped 25% and net income dropped 96%. However, earnings met Wall Street's estimates of $0.10 a share. IBM did Intel one better by beating the Streets expectations by a penny. Like Intel, IBM's third-quarter revenue and earnings were also down, but by just 6% and 19%, respectively.  Earnings season is in full swing again. (Have you bought earnings seasons gifts for your loved ones yet?  Time is running out!) Here's a rundown of some of the other major companies and how they fared:  --International Paper (NYSE: IP) handily topped estimates of   $0.05 per share, reporting earnings of $0.14. That reflects earnings for the   third quarter of 2001 of $68 million, compared to $260 million a   year ago.  --Pfizer (NYSE: PFE) reported third-quarter earnings of $0.34   per share, a penny ahead of analyst estimates. The company expects double-digit   revenue growth in 2002.  --Ford (NYSE: F), the world's No. 2 automaker, lost as much as   analysts were expecting. Not counting charges and gains, the company lost   $0.28 per share, compared to a profit of $0.50 in the year-ago   period. Revenue was down 9% over the past 12 months.  --Citigroup (NYSE: C) met its lowered expectations, earning   $0.63 per share, compared with a gain of $0.68 a year ago. The company expects   its next quarter's earnings to grow by 15%.  --Data storage company EMC (NYSE: EMC) reported its first loss   in some 12 years, losing nearly a billion dollars in the third quarter, compared   to a half-billion-dollar gain a year ago.  ----------------------------------------------------------------- POST OF THE DAY -----------------------------------------------------------------  AMD - MORE HAMMER DETAILS ""I know it sounds ridiculous, but here is the bind that Intel is in. If vendors see a strong consumer preference for Tualatin over the Willamette, the Pentium 4 will be seen as a failure. If the supply chain sees the Pentium 4 as a failure they won't rush--heck they won't even crawl--to support the socket 478 platform, in particular the SDRAM and DDR versions of Brookdale. Once Northwood is shipping in quantity, and Intel has enough 0.13 micron fab capacity, then Intel can afford to hype Tualatin.

I hope you had the time of your life."" -- Green Day  ----------------------------------------------------------------- TOP STORY -----------------------------------------------------------------  HARD TIMES AT MICROSOFT? Is Microsoft (Nasdaq: MSFT) ready to fly again? Backing out a $1.2 billion hit in its investment portfolio, the software titan reported profits of $0.43 a share. That was three cents better than analysts were expecting as sales grew by 6% to $6.1 billion.  >>FULL STORY: http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=522447  ----------------------------------------------------------------- NEWS TO GO -----------------------------------------------------------------  Pass the sun block. Sun Microsystems (Nasdaq: SUNW) is reporting a nickel a share loss for its fiscal first-quarter on a steep decline in revenue. The top-line sank to $2.9 billion from a $5.1 billion showing a year ago. Sun's set came as no surprise since the network computing specialist had warned investors earlier this month. The California company expects to return to profitability by the June quarter.  Holy Beanie Babies, eBay (Nasdaq: EBAY) is still hot. The online auctioneer trounced expectations and bid up its fourth-quarter prospects. Quarterly earnings came in at $0.12 a share on a 71% surge in sales to $194.4 million. It's also raising the ante for the current period. While the company was originally expecting December-quarter revenue to come in between $195 million and $205 million, it is now hiking up both ends of the range by an extra $5 million. The strong showing and bar raising is an impressive feat as the company is a month into its 100-day Auction for America in which it is waiving its fees for charitable listings. http://www.lnksrv.com/m.asp?i=522448  There's no business like e-business for PeopleSoft (Nasdaq: PSFT) as the enterprise software maker reported earnings from recurring operations of $0.15 a share, three cents ahead of Wall Street's projection. Thanks to a growth in license revenue for its flagship PeopleSoft 8 -- an excellent name for a B-movie if there ever was one -- sales topped the half-billion dollar mark.  No one is putting struggling cow-patched computer maker Gateway (NYSE: GTW) out to pasture just yet. While the company's third-quarter loss was in line with already lowered expectations, Gateway sees shipments picking back up in the current quarter. Excluding charges, the company lost $0.17 a share on revenue of $1.4 billion. The company managed to grow its domestic market share in the consumer and education segments and is expecting to report a quarterly profit to close out the year.  Last doughnuts with the Fool Finally, it's true. Come next week you will have to enjoy your Krispy Kreme (NYSE: KKD) glazed doughnut and your Starbucks (Nasdaq: SBUX) double latte without the company of your Breakfast With the Fool. It was September 21, 1998, when Yi-Hsin Chang and Brian Bauer rolled out our first morning plateful. The Nasdaq Composite stood at 1663.77 back then. It's at 1652.72 this morning.

At the same time, revenue projections are extremely conservative, at $1.4B for Christmas. Given the continuous stream of revenue over-estimation coming from Apple over the last 12 months, we have to assume that even Apple doesn't expect its special surprise to help Q4's results.""  >>FULL POST: http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=522450  =================================================================  SPONSORED BY: ING Direct Power Saving with ING DIRECT!

"Dear Member,  It has been more than a month since the tragic events of September 11.  And I want to express my personal appreciation to the many thousands of readers from around the world who have sent in words of sympathy to the people of this country and in particular of New York City.  The New York Times on the Web has kept open the area reserved for these messages, and you are free to read them on our site.  http://www.nytimes.com/2001/09/19/national/ATTFORUM.html?rd=hcmcp?p=041EDj041E924Krtg012000mUxrvUxgm  The unfolding developments on the military and public health areas are covered in great depth by the Times' staff of reporters and editors. To make it easier to catch up on the past six weeks of coverage, we have created a special section on the Web called ""A Nation Challenged.""

You can listen to conversations with such veteran correspondents as R.W. Apple, John F.

His photos explore refugees piecing together a Koran, spending time in an opium den and living in a Pakistani school. Vincent accompanies the essay with an audio description.  http://www.nytimes.com/photojournal?rd=hcmcp?p=041E7b041E924Krtg012000mUxrvUxgm  I have to confess to being a fervent New York Yankees fan, going back to my childhood as a boy in the Bronx.

Invest in your future career today! http://www.lnksrv.com/m.asp?i=524550  ================================================================= YOUR QUESTIONS ANSWERED  Q. WHY DO SOME REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT TRUSTS (REITS) HAVE TERRIFIC DIVIDEND YIELDS WHILE OTHERS DON'T? IS THERE ANY REASON NOT TO INVEST IN HIGH-YIELD REITS?  A. If a yield looks too good to be true, it probably is. Remember that it's the market that sets the price of the stock. And as a stock's price drops, its yield rises.  For perspective, consider that a 30-year U.S. Treasury is priced to yield around 6 percent, because investors are pretty sure the dividend will be paid. But Russian government bond yields can hover around 30 percent -- because investors are not so sure.  The same goes with REITs. As an example, consider Kranzco, the highest yielding shopping center REIT with a yield of around 15 percent at the time of this writing (in 2000). Because of weak earnings, it has been forced to cut its dividend. This development caused many investors to sell, sending the stock price south and the yield up. Management's dividend cut may be enough, but investors are understandably nervous about what the future holds.  If you invest in a REIT yielding 10 percent, things may well turn out hunky-dory. But if you go for one kicking out 18 percent to 30 percent, you're buying into income streams that other folks find pretty doubtful. You'll want to do enough research to be pretty sure you're right.   Q. WHAT IS THE LEAST AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT YOU CAN INVEST? WHAT IF YOU DON'T HAVE ENOUGH MONEY TO BUY 100 SHARES?  A. It's tragic that many people put off investing for years, thinking they're not rich enough to benefit from the stock market. You definitely don't need to have $1,000 or more before you start investing. You don't have to buy 100 shares at a time. You can buy 17 shares or nine shares -- or even fractions of shares, using some services. For instance, at buyandhold.com, you can invest as little as $20 at a time and buy fractional shares of stock, paying $2.99 per trade. http://www.lnksrv.com/m.asp?i=524551  If you're really interested in learning more about the basics, check out our Beginning Investing Online Seminar that also includes a copy of our Money Guide. http://www.lnksrv.com/m.asp?i=524552   ----------------------------------------------------------------- THIS WEEK'S LESSON  WARREN BUFFETT ON INVESTING A great way to learn about investing is to glean insights from experienced, successful investors. One of the savviest is Warren Buffett. Here are some comments he made at his Berkshire Hathaway shareholder meeting in 2000:  ""The first investment primer was written by Aesop in 600 B.C. He said, 'A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush.' Aesop forgot to include when you get the two in the bush and what interest rates are. Investing is simply figuring out your cash outlay (the bird in the hand) and comparing it to how many birds are in the bush and when you get them.""  ""It's no religious thing why we don't invest in technology. It's just that we've never found a company where we think we know what the bush will look like in 10 years and how many birds will be in it. We understand technology and its impact on society. It's the predictability of the economics of the situation 10 years out that we don't understand. ... The only way we know how to make money is to buy businesses we understand.""  ""I own 100 shares of companies such as Microsoft and Intel, so I get the annual reports. I don't think it's a dumb thing if you want to learn about businesses to invest tiny amounts in various companies -- especially for young people -- to get exposed to various managements, to go to shareholder meetings, get reports, etc.""  ""It pays to have the right role models/heroes. ... You'll want to be a little or a lot more. I tell students to pick out the qualities they admire in people they admire and ask why they can't develop those qualities themselves. It's very simple. The person you'd really like to admire is yourself.""  Berkshire's Vice Chairman Charlie Munger added, ""You can't avoid making wrong decisions in life, but if you recognize them and do something about them, you can wring some lemonade out of them. We've scrambled our way out of many mistakes.""  For more Buffett wisdom, head to berkshirehathaway.com, where there are several decades' worth of his extremely educational letters to shareholders.

The 38% increase in earnings per share is primarily due to strength in wholesale trading and marketing and solid growth at the regulated utility operations. * Cinergy reaffirmed its 2001 earnings guidance of $2.75 per share.  Although no comments regarding 2002 estimated earnings were provided by the company, we currently feel comfortable with our 2002E EPS of $2.95.  We expect Cinergy to grow earnings at a conservative rate of 7%-8% per annum, with regulated operations growing at 5%-6% and energy merchant operations growing at 10%-12%.  However, if the economy weakens further and wholesale power prices remain at current levels we may revisit on 2002 estimated earnings per share at a later date. * Energy Merchant segment earnings were $0.37 per share, more than double the $0.15 per share earned in last year's third quarter.  Origination, marketing and trading gross margins rose $43 million, or $0.07 per share, to $217.1 million from $174.1 million last year.  Electricity trading volumes totaled 86,398,499 mWh, up 150% from last year's levels.  Physical and financial gas trading volumes totaled 48.1 bcf per day, up 160% over the same period last year. Cinergy Solutions, the segment's cogeneration business, added $0.03 per share in the quarter.  Also, CIN added roughly 1,100 MW of new gas-fired peaking capacity since the third quarter last year. * Regulated Operations earned $0.48 per share in the latest quarter, compared with $0.46 per share in the third quarter 2000.  Gross margins improved due to increased customer demand from service territory growth and warmer weather. This was offset slightly by increased operations and maintenance and interest expenses.  Total electric retail sales volumes were 13,898,726 mWh, up 3.6% over last year's level.  Gas retail and transportation sales volumes declined 10.8% to 10,248,332 mcf.  The decrease was primarily related to weather as well as softening industrial demand.  As of September 2001, total electric customers were 1,500,790, up from 1,481,411 a year ago and total gas customers were 489,667, up from 482,328 a year ago. * Results from the Power Technology and Infrastructure Services segment lost $0.05 per share, down from a loss of $0.03 in the prior year.  Through Cinergy Ventures Group, this division pursues technology equity investments and runs technology pilots.  CIN owns several start-up energy infrastructure companies that incurred additional costs as well as roughly $100 million of direct and indirect investments in power technology-related companies that decreased in value during the third quarter. * We continue to rate shares of CIN Strong Buy. Our 12-month price target of $37 per share is based upon a P/E multiple of 12.5 times our 2002 EPS estimate of $2.95. In our opinion, the premium valuation is warranted. CIN is a low cost producer of electricity (primarily coal) that is strategically located in the Midwest, and is actively adding to its merchant generation portfolio. In total, Cinergy Corp. owns 13,000 MW of generation capacity. Of that total, 6,000 MW is regulated and 7,000 MW is unregulated. Because of Cinergy Corp.'s strategic location and its large fleet of low-cost power plants, we think the company would be attractive to potential acquirers.    <<CIN01Q3.doc>>   - CIN01Q3.doc   Visit our website at http://www.ubswarburg.com  This message contains confidential information and is intended only for the individual named.

"   -----Original Message----- From:  ""John Gualy"" <jgualy@eagleglobal.com>@ENRON   Sent: Friday, October 26, 2001 10:33 AM To: Gualy, Jaime Subject: FW: Comments on the Status of ENE ($16/sh).       --------------- Authored by: Jeff Dietert ---------------- OUR VIEW:  ENE is down huge (-80% for the year, and trading at only 7.5xFY02) and its hard to imagine more confusion associated with the stock. More pressure is likely today on the news of S&P revising its long-term ratings outlook to negative (based on the decline in market capitalization) and ENE's additional draw on its credit facilities (which does not change its net debt, but prevents banks from denying access to its liquidity in the event that the rating agencies do downgrade its credit rating, which could break covenants and restrict liquidity).  We believe the major issues are: 1) management's ability to regain the confidence of the street and persuade investors that it can restore balance sheet strength and generate the expected earnings and cash flow,  2) ENE must maintain its investment grade credit rating, 3) ENE must successfully execute its divestiture plans, and 4) ENE must control the timing of the recognition of the write-down in the value of any assets whose market value is less than book.  IF ENE management does not step-up to calm investor fears, these fears could become a self fulfilling prophecy.  In the potentially vicious cycle, investor fears could drive the stock down, the lower stock prices force the rating agencies to consider downgrades, potentially lower credit ratings force counter-parties to reduce exposure with ENE, limiting ENE's to generate earnings and cash flow.  Thus we see a big incentive for ENE to clarify the issues.  We expect ENE to put together a more complete explanation of the major issues over the next few days in order to stabilize the stock.   If/when ENE schedules a conference call or road show, we would consider this a bullish sign.  Absent further clarification, the stock is likely to continue to be weak.   Our gut feel is that ENE can pull it off and that long-term investors should hold firm, as eventually the stock gets valued on earnings (with upside potential to $25+/sh over the next 12 to 18 month period), rather than break-up value ($16/sh-see below).  We believe new money (with high risk tolerance!) should wait until ENE announces its intentions for communicating a clear path to recovery.  ENE's VIEW:  ENE has stated that it has reviewed its asset base with Arthur Anderson and that no additional asset impairments are required other than an approximate $200 MM charge expected in 1Q02 due to an accounting change. With no further asset write-downs, and roughly $890 MM in asset divestitures ($390 MM India E&P, $250 MM Puerto Rico power plant, and $250 MM Brazilian power plant) in 4Q01, ENE's D/TC ratio is likely to decline from 50% at the end of 3Q01 to roughly 48% at the end of the year.  After the close of the Portland General divestiture, expected by year-end 2002, we expect its D/TC to fall below 45% (we are projecting FCF to be break-even in FY02).  We estimate that ENE's interest coverage at the end of 3Q01 is 3.5x.  ENE is currently rated BBB+ by S&P and Baa1 by Moodys, and would need to decline 3 ratings to fall below investment grade.  For comparison purposes, S&P's BBB median D/TC is 47.4% and EBITDA/Int. Exp. coverage is 6.1x, while BB (non-investment grade) median D/TC is 61.3% and interest coverage is 3.8x.  IMPORTANCE OF ENE's INVESTMENT GRADE CREDIT RATING:  We believe that ENE's Wholesale segments, which generates 80% of its EBIT, would be noncompetitive if the credit rating falls below investment grade.  In addition, a decline in credit rating below investment grade would trigger the issuance of 50 MM shares of common stock and $1 B in convertible preferred stock associated with ENE's off-balance sheet structured financing vehicles.  We believe ENE will do what ever it can to maintain an  investment grade rating.  Moodys has its BBB+ rating under review for a possible downgrade.   Last night S&P revised its long-term ratings outlook to negative due to concerns that the significant drop in market capitalization in the past week has adversely affected the company's financial flexibility and could impede its ability to pursue plans to rebuild its balance sheet.  BREAK-UP VALUE:  We believe ENE 's Wholesale America ($2.7 B in TTM EBITDA), Wholesale Europe ($900 MM) and Retail ($450 MM) segments are conservatively worth a 4x multiple (recent multiples have been higher, but we are discounting due to limited buying interest) or $16.2 B.  The Gas Pipeline segment ($820 MM) and Global Assets ($200 MM) valued at a 6x multiple are worth $6.1 B.  PGE valued at the divestiture price is $2.9 B. Total asset value is conservatively $25 B, vs. debt of $13 B, leaving $12 B or $16/sh for equity investors in a break-up scenario.  The challenge is, if ENE loses its investment grade rating, the value ($16.2 B) of its Wholesale and Retail segments would be materially compromised--leaving little for equity investors.  POTENTIAL FOR ADDITIONAL ASSET IMPAIRMENTS:  ENE's Global Assets portfolio includes assets with $6 B in book value (ENE's total gross PP&E is $14 B) that has generated an EBIT loss of $18 MM (EBITDA of +$168 MM) over the last 12-month period (4Q00 to 3Q01).  The Global Assets portfolio includes Elektro (an electric utility in Brazil), Dabhol (power plant in India), TGS (a natural gas pipeline in Argentina), Azurix and Enron Wind operations. These assets seem ripe for a write-down although the company argues that it has reviewed them with Arthur Anderson recently and that the assets are not impaired.  ENE will have to continue to convince Anderson that the value of these assets has not been impaired.  The write-down of these assets would reduce shareholder equity and ENE's D/TC, threatening its credit rating. It is not clear that ENE put all its under-performing assets in the Global Assets portfolio.  There could be other poor performing assets in other segments that are hidden by strong performance in its Wholesale business.  ADDITIONAL DATA POINTS:  ENE's counter-parties seem to be supportive and have not indicated any change in business activity.  EnronOnline trading volume was slightly above average yesterday.  Some energy traders have bought ENE in their personal accounts, convinced that ENE core marketing business is strong and the belief that the equity markets have over-reacted.  Lots of ENE corporate finance people are working late nights solidifying ENE's financial strategy (hopefully for a more complete discussion with the street?).  THE SEC INQUIRY:  We believe ENE has an extensive paper trail from its attorneys and accountants that will clear them of any legal problems with the SEC associated with the LJM partnerships in which CFO Andy Fastow participated.  We do not expect the SEC to find any legal wrong-doing--although this doesn't mean that they won't express qualitative concern over the appearance of the transactions.      **************************************************************************** *************************   This e-mail is based on information obtained from sources which Simmons & Company International believes to be reliable, but Simmons & Company International does not represent or warrant its accuracy.

"   -----Original Message----- From:  Gualy, Jaime   Sent: Friday, October 26, 2001 11:01 AM To: Rogers, Benjamin Subject: FW: Comments on the Status of ENE ($16/sh).     -----Original Message----- From:  ""John Gualy"" <jgualy@eagleglobal.com>@ENRON   Sent: Friday, October 26, 2001 10:33 AM To: Gualy, Jaime Subject: FW: Comments on the Status of ENE ($16/sh).       --------------- Authored by: Jeff Dietert ---------------- OUR VIEW:  ENE is down huge (-80% for the year, and trading at only 7.5xFY02) and its hard to imagine more confusion associated with the stock. More pressure is likely today on the news of S&P revising its long-term ratings outlook to negative (based on the decline in market capitalization) and ENE's additional draw on its credit facilities (which does not change its net debt, but prevents banks from denying access to its liquidity in the event that the rating agencies do downgrade its credit rating, which could break covenants and restrict liquidity).  We believe the major issues are: 1) management's ability to regain the confidence of the street and persuade investors that it can restore balance sheet strength and generate the expected earnings and cash flow,  2) ENE must maintain its investment grade credit rating, 3) ENE must successfully execute its divestiture plans, and 4) ENE must control the timing of the recognition of the write-down in the value of any assets whose market value is less than book.  IF ENE management does not step-up to calm investor fears, these fears could become a self fulfilling prophecy.  In the potentially vicious cycle, investor fears could drive the stock down, the lower stock prices force the rating agencies to consider downgrades, potentially lower credit ratings force counter-parties to reduce exposure with ENE, limiting ENE's to generate earnings and cash flow.  Thus we see a big incentive for ENE to clarify the issues.  We expect ENE to put together a more complete explanation of the major issues over the next few days in order to stabilize the stock.   If/when ENE schedules a conference call or road show, we would consider this a bullish sign.  Absent further clarification, the stock is likely to continue to be weak.   Our gut feel is that ENE can pull it off and that long-term investors should hold firm, as eventually the stock gets valued on earnings (with upside potential to $25+/sh over the next 12 to 18 month period), rather than break-up value ($16/sh-see below).  We believe new money (with high risk tolerance!) should wait until ENE announces its intentions for communicating a clear path to recovery.  ENE's VIEW:  ENE has stated that it has reviewed its asset base with Arthur Anderson and that no additional asset impairments are required other than an approximate $200 MM charge expected in 1Q02 due to an accounting change. With no further asset write-downs, and roughly $890 MM in asset divestitures ($390 MM India E&P, $250 MM Puerto Rico power plant, and $250 MM Brazilian power plant) in 4Q01, ENE's D/TC ratio is likely to decline from 50% at the end of 3Q01 to roughly 48% at the end of the year.  After the close of the Portland General divestiture, expected by year-end 2002, we expect its D/TC to fall below 45% (we are projecting FCF to be break-even in FY02).  We estimate that ENE's interest coverage at the end of 3Q01 is 3.5x.  ENE is currently rated BBB+ by S&P and Baa1 by Moodys, and would need to decline 3 ratings to fall below investment grade.  For comparison purposes, S&P's BBB median D/TC is 47.4% and EBITDA/Int. Exp. coverage is 6.1x, while BB (non-investment grade) median D/TC is 61.3% and interest coverage is 3.8x.

If there aren't any, they invent some.  They pay you not to milk the cows.  They take both cows, shoot one, milk the other and pour the milk down the drain.  They then require you to fill out forms accounting for the missing cows.  ----------  American Democracy  The government promises to give you two cows, if you vote for it.  After the election, the president is impeached for speculating in cow futures.  The press dubs the affair ""cowgate,"" but supports the president.  The cows sue you for breach of contract.

You sell three of them to your publicly listed company, using letters of credit opened by your brother-in-law at the bank, then execute a debt/equity swap with an associated general offer so that you get all four cows back, with a tax exemption for five cows.  The milk rights of the six cows are transferred via an intermediary to a Cayman Island company secretly owned by the majority shareholder who sells the rights to all seven cows back to your listed company.

(OTC BB:  LQDX)       S= mart  investors understand that companies with government and military  app= lications are especially attractive in times of global  instability.    Our=  current recommendation, LIQUIDIX, INC. of  Arizona (OTC BB: LQDX), has pos= itioned itself as the leading competitor in  the high-tech industrial manuf= acturing industry with its customizable  array of magnetic fluid vacuum sea= ls.    NASA, Honeywell,  ADM, Intel, have already used the vacuum seals cre= ated by Liquidix. These  products benefit such important technologies as na= vigational gyros,  infrared detectors, heat-seeking missiles, laser sightin= g and night-vision  equipment.  =09       ABOUT THE  COMPANY     LIQUIDIX, INC.  recently purchased Advanced Flui= d Systems, a company based in the United  Kingdom, strategically increasing=  its marketshare and making Liquidix  competitive in the global market.    =  Liquidix has  signed contracts with several Military/Government Agencies a= nd U.S.  National Laboratories, including NASA, which have produced signifi= cant  growth in the company.     Liquidix is one of only three  companies i= n the world to produce magnetic fluid vacuum seals and it's the  only one t= hat is traded publicly in the United States. Because costs in  this industr= y are very similar between companies, Liquidix has studied and  surpassed i= ts competition in delivery time. Liquidix can deliver the same  product to = its destination in 1/4 the time of its nearest competitor,  making them esp= ecially desirable for companies who must meet an increasing  demand for mag= netic fluid vacuum seals.     Liquidix has  conservatively estimated that t= heir gross revenues for 2002 will increase  more than 40% over 2001, and by=  2003 will increase another 110%. Through  strategic mergers and acquisitio= ns Liquidix also estimates that their  profit margins for 2002 will increas= e by 60% over 2001, and by 2003 will  increase another 200%.      REASONS T= O OWN THE  STOCK    1. Liquidix  provides magnetic fluid vacuum seals for g= overnment and military  applications that are in higher demand due to incre= asing military activity  in the U.S.       2. Liquidix, through  strategic = alliances and acquisitions, has established itself as the leader  of an ind= ustry that is projected to earn more than $4.5 billion dollars by  2002.   =     3. Liquidix provides  products to industry giants such as NASA, HONEYWE= LL, INTEL, and ADM,  virtually guaranteeing the growth of this strong  comp= any.       4. Liquidix aggressive  and strategic acquisition of companies l= ike Advanced Fluid Systems  demonstrates a strong vision for the future and=  positions them as a world  leader in magnetic fluid technology.     5. Liq= uidix is one of  only three companies in the world to produce magnetic flui= d vacuum seals  and it is the only one that is traded publicly in the  U.S.=        6. Facilities owned and  operated by Liquidix in the United States a= nd Europe have given the  company a foothold on both sides of the Atlantic,=  with opportunities to  break into additional international markets.

The group's attractive relative P/E valuation, its high relative yield, its defensive nature and interest sensitivity are all reasons why we think electric stocks should perform well versus the overall stock market for the rest of 2001. * The average P/E ratio for the electric utility group is now 10.8x estimated 2002 EPS, compared with a 2002 P/E of 24.2x for the S&P 500.  The relative P/E ratio of 0.45x is below the 25-year historic normal range of 0.60x-0.80x, and is also near the all-time low of 0.40x. * The average yield for the electric utility group is now 4.96%, which should make the group attractive to individual investors earning around 2.25% in the typical money market fund.  Historically, the yield on utility stocks has rarely been more than twice as high as money market fund yields like it is today. * Falling oil and natural gas prices have caused wholesale power prices, that were already very low, to fall even further.  Electricity futures prices, shown in Exhibit 2 on Page 5, fell by another 5% in most regions in the past week. Electricity futures prices have fallen by about 10% across the U.S. in the past month. * Coal prices have not come down in line with the big declines in the prices of oil, natural gas and wholesale power (see Page 8 for data on spot coal prices).  The spot price of coal is more than 50% above the price levels from late last year in all coal markets.  It appears that due to supply constraints, coal prices have not followed the decline in oil and natural gas prices. * Electric utility stocks lagged the overall stock market last week.  For the five trading days last week, electric utility stocks went down in value by 3.7%, compared with a gain of 1.6% for the S&P 500.  IPP stocks had a good week, with an average gain of 7.1%. * SPECIAL HOLIDAY TRIVIA QUIZ.  This Thursday, Americans celebrate the Thanksgiving Day holiday.  Can you name two nuclear power plants whose names remind you of Thanksgiving?

"  -----Original Message----- From: Freddy Victoria [mailto:fvictoria@isigrp.com] Sent: Monday, November 19, 2001 9:55 AM To: DL-Equity Subject: ISI Economy, Money and Markets Importance: High    Dear Equity,  Good morning,   I hope you had a god weekend.  I was finally able to catch up on all the gimmicks being thrown around to jump-start the economy.  Have you seen the one that would temporarily suspend sales taxes, a la 0.0% financing on autos?  What the politico's should really do is get some ideas from the organizers of the Victoria's Secret (no, there's no relation unfortunately) TV show or the Britney Spear's HBO show.  Have you seen the ratings on those!?  That seems to be what is drawing the American consumer these days.   But despite that being still up in the air, it looks like the economy is in the process of bottoming anyway.  Stocks have continued to rally, oil is below $18, commodities have rallied, money is up and so is refi.  If we could only get the surveys to behave, we'd be very happy.  Interest rates had been falling up until last week when the backed up.  This was largely interpreted as the bond market smelling the economic recovery.  If rates get too high, it could obviously be a problem, but this ""hiccup"" in rates is something we have seen before in periods of transition.  Page 3 highlights the ""hiccups"" in the past when you had the economy shifted from a recession to a recovery.    Another big question on everyone's mind is Holiday Sales.  They are widely expected to be weak, weak, weak.  So where does that leave room for a surprise? on the upside.  Turn to page 6 for all the positives that could help Holiday Sales.  I for one am not expecting a lump of coal.    The political report highlights the effects of the war in Afghanistan on globalization.  Despite all the initial doom-and-gloom, it looks like it has actually pushed global cooperation along.    Jim Moltz thinks the market is just about fairly valued here at about 22 times 2002 earnings.  That being said, he also thinks the liquidity available out there will drive the market higher when those assets start to actively look for higher yielding instruments.  Some of that could be into the long end of the curve if rates stay higher, but some will also be into the equity markets.  Jim also tweaked his operating earnings estimate for 2001 from $38 to $39.50.  2002 is still at $50.    Have a great week and a very happy Thanksgiving.  If there is anything I can do, I will be in so please just let me know.

"B,  Good talking to you.  I will email your dad today to get his advice.  Does he have a junior executive type that works directly for him?  In my ideal fantasy world I would really like to work for someone like that and get that type of exposure to corp finance/ industry......  I am probably dreaming, but didn't know if CEO's had people like that working directly   for them.  Obviously not an assistant, but someone in a junior execuitive role that goes with them to all the meetings and handles follow-up etc..... I would love to be exposed to they type of knowledge.

Should an investor be concerned if one or more officers of a=20 company sell shares of its stock that they own?=20  A. Although it may look like a red flag, it isn't necessarily=20 one. Many executives today receive a large part of their=20 compensation in stock options. So when they have to buy a house=20 or make a college tuition payment, they sell some shares. They=20 may also be trying to diversify their investments, not wanting=20 to have too much of their portfolio in one company.=20  On the other hand, one insider (or many insiders) selling might=20 indeed signal a loss of faith in the company. If you're worried,=20 you might want to take a closer look at the company's recent=20 performance. Perhaps fire up your computer and see what people=20 interested in the company are saying about it online, on message=20 boards.=20   Q. What does ""insured by FDIC"" mean, and what does it NOT=20 insure?=20  A. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. (FDIC) insures our=20 traditional checking, savings and money market accounts (as well=20 as CDs) held at banks and thrifts for up to $100,000. Note,=20 though, that the FDIC does not cover stocks, bonds, mutual=20 funds, life insurance policies, annuities and the like. For=20 these, check with your financial service company to see what=20 kind of insurance may be provided.=20  Learn more about the FDIC at their website. To make sure you are=20 stashing your short-term cash in the most profitable place,=20 check out our Savings Center.=20 http://www.fdic.gov/ http://www.fool.com/savings/savings.htm  ----------------------------------------------------------------- THIS WEEK'S LESSON=20  OPTIONS 101 Imagine you want to invest in Legume Gas Works (ticker: BEANZ).=20 You can buy shares the usual way -- or you can buy options.=20 Here's an introduction to options.=20  There are two main types: calls and puts. A call gives you the=20 right to buy a set amount of shares at a set price within a=20 certain period of time (often just a few months). For this=20 right, you pay a price premium. Puts are similar, but give you=20 the right to sell shares.=20  If Legume is selling for $50 per share and you expect it to=20 rise, you could buy ""October $55"" call options for it. Let's say=20 you snap up calls to buy 100 shares, for $6 each, or a total of=20 $600. If just before your options expire Legume is selling for=20 $65 per share, you can exercise your options and buy 100 shares=20 for $5,500. Then you can keep them or sell them for $6,500.=20  If you sell, you make a $1,000 profit, right? Nope. You paid=20 $600, remember? So your profit is down to $400 -- less, when you=20 account for trading commissions.=20  Options are risky. If Legume stays at $55 or falls, your $600=20 would be entirely lost. It has to top $61 per share -- $55 plus=20 $6 -- by October for you to profit.=20  Some folks like options because of the leverage they offer. They=20 point out that if you only have $1,000, you can only buy 20=20 shares of a $50 stock. Alternatively, that $1,000 could buy many=20 more options tied to hundreds of shares of stock. True enough.=20 With options, though, timing is critical. If things don't go=20 your way in a short-term time frame, your option will expire=20 worthless.=20  Most options expire unexercised and worthless. (Those most=20 likely to profit from options are the ones who ""write"" or sell=20 the options.) That's because options are really about buying=20 time, not stocks. If you're sure that Legume's stock will rise,=20 you're probably best off buying its stock. Then if it doesn't=20 behave as you expected it to, you can either sell the shares or=20 hang on patiently.=20  Options are not for beginning investors, and even more advanced=20 investors might consider steering clear.=20  You can read more about options at this Motley Fool FAQ. http://www.fool.com/FoolFAQ/foolfaq0055.htm   =3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D= =3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D= =3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D  SPONSORED BY: Ameritrade Ameritrade brings you the market's most valuable commodity: Knowledge.

"   -----Original Message----- From:  ""Russo, Brian"" <Brian.Russo@ubsw.com>@ENRON   On Behalf Of ""Abramson, Barry"" <Barry.Abramson@ubsw.com> Sent: Monday, November 26, 2001 7:37 AM To: undisclosed-recipients:;@ENRON Subject: Electric Utilities:  Weekly Update  KEY POINTS * On the basis of the group's extremely low relative valuation, we continue to recommend the electric utility group.  The electric group's P/E based upon 2002 estimated EPS is now only 10.8x, compared with a 2002 P/E for the S&P 500 of 24.5x.  The relative P/E ratio has dropped to just 0.44x, near its all-time low of 0.40x and well below the 25-year historic normal relative P/E range of 0.60x to 0.80x. * The high relative yield of 5.0% on the average electric utility stock also should provide good support against any major downward move, in our opinion.  The relative yield on utility stocks is more than double the yields available to small investors in cash equivalents such as money market funds. * The fully-regulated transmission and distribution utilities (T&D) appear to have stopped outperforming the utilities that have a large merchant energy exposure.  The lower-risk, higher-yielding T&D stocks had been going up for most of the past few months while the utilities with merchant energy had been falling.  Now it appears that the rotation into the T&D stocks has ended, at least for now. * Last week, we added PPL Corp. (PPL-$35.80, rated Strong Buy)[2] to our Global Top 10 List of utility stocks. The major reasons for adding PPL to the Global Top 10 List were the stock's very low relative P/E ratio, its fleet of low-cost unregulated generating plants and its above-average earnings growth potential.  We also believe it is likely that PPL might take actions to improve its very low stock price, such as a dividend hike and a common share buyback.  In addition, at PPL's current low relative valuation, we believe it is an attractive takeover target.  There are four other U.S. utility stocks on our Global Top 10 List-Dominion Resources (D-$59.96, rated Strong Buy)[2], Duke Energy (DUK-$37.64, rated Strong Buy)[2], TXU Corp. (TXU-$45.87, rated Strong Buy)[2] and American Electric Power (AEP-$42.39, rated Buy)[2].  The rest of our Global Top 10 List includes El Paso Energy (EPG-$49.73)[14] of the U.S., Suez-Lyonnaise and Lattice Group of Europe, and Tokyo Electric Power and Chubu Electric of Asia. * The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) issued an order last week that changes the basis upon which FERC will allow large utilities to sell wholesale power at market-based rates.  FERC's order is designed to reduce the possibility that a large company could exert market power in a particular region.  FERC stated that if power sellers are found to be ""pivotal to their region"" and if the sellers are not participating in a FERC approved regional transmission organization (RTO), then the sellers could lose their right to charge market-based rates.  Sellers that are ""pivotal to their region"" have generating units that must run to meet the region's electric load.  FERC applied these new rules immediately to three large utilities-American Electric Power, Entergy Corp. (ETR-$36.95, rated Hold) and Southern Company (SO-$23.50, rated Hold)[2].  FERC stated that all three of these large utilities are not now currently members of a FERC approved RTO.  AEP, ETR and SO have lost the authority to make sales at market-based rates except for sales that take place in regions where the grid is controlled by a FERC-approved RTO.  The three companies have been given 15 days to respond by FERC.  Under the new rules, FERC can order refunds and can order these companies to revert back to cost-based rates. * It is possible that FERC is using this directive to strongly influence the rapid formation of FERC-approved RTOs.  Some of the larger U.S utilities have been reluctant to join large RTOs and have tried to form their own RTOs in which they would be the dominant member.  In the long run, we expect FERC to prevail and we expect all U.S. utilities, large and small, to form RTOs that have FERC approval.  We think that the loss of the ability to sell wholesale power at market-based rates, even if only for a short period of time until the company achieves compliance with FERC's RTO goals, is a strong enough incentive for large utilities to move faster to join large RTOs. * We lowered our EPS estimates for Edison International (EIX-$14.20, rated Buy)[2,10] after the company held a conference call last week at which time it gave new earnings guidance for 2001 and 2002.  We lowered our 2001 EPS estimate from $1.75 to $1.30 and reduced our 2002 EPS estimate from $2.00 to $1.60.  It appears that EIX's major emphasis over the next 1 to 2 years will be to improve its balance sheet and regain its financial health, and therefore, earnings growth does not appear to be a major objective. * We reduced our 2002 EPS estimate on Cinergy Corp. (CIN-$30.87, rated Strong Buy) from $2.95 to $2.85.  Lower forward power prices for 2002 and the weakness in the local economy are likely to hurt 2002 earnings. * TXU announced two major asset divestitures in the United Kingdom last week.  TXU plans to sell its U.K. electric distribution business and its 50% interest in 24seven to London Electricity for $1.87 billion.  TXU also announced an agreement to sell its 2,000 MW West Burton power station to London Electricity for $523 million.  We think that both of these moves are positive steps for TXU.  (Additional details can be found in the following section of this report.) * Utility stocks lagged the overall market last week.  For the four trading days last week, electric utility stocks were virtually unchanged, with an average gain of only 0.1%, compared with an increase of 1.0% for the S&P 500. IPP stocks had a bad week, with an average decline of 3.1%.    <<WKLY11126.doc>>    - WKLY11126.doc   Visit our website at http://www.ubswarburg.com  This message contains confidential information and is intended only for the individual named.

Astoria E= nergy hopes to have the natural-gas-fired, combined-cycle plant that will b= e at an existing oil terminal in the Astoria section of Queens in service b= y 2004. The company must do a certain amount of demolition and site prepara= tion before it can begin construction, and still must receive some local pe= rmits from New York City. Astoria Energy is a unit of SCS Energy LLC, a pri= vately owned energy development company based in Concord, Mass.    Analysis= : The announcement of a new power plant scheduled for the New York City are= a should be evaluated within the context of severe power supply problems th= at have been identified within this region. Like California, New York also = suffers from a supply / demand imbalance. However, even if or when power su= pply can be increased in New York, the core load center of New York City st= ill suffers from inherent transmission deficiencies that continue to take t= heir own toll on the stability of the market. In other words, transmission = capacity in the region has been determined to be deficient to the extent th= at power outside of the city cannot be reliably imported. The fact that Ast= oria Energy has received approval from New York state's siting board to pro= ceed with this New York City-based plant is significant, but it should not = be forgotten that the company also must receive local permits from city gov= ernment. This could be easier said than done, as other planned power plants=  in the area have been blocked or significantly altered over the last year = by community groups in New York City and surrounding boroughs who ardently = voice concerns about environmental and other ramifications of new plant con= struction.   The problems within the New York power market have been well d= ocumented. The state of New York reportedly has not brought a new plant onl= ine since 1996, when a 200-MW plant opened in Brooklyn. It has been almost = seven years since a 1,000-MW unit in Oswego, N.Y., marked the last plant to=  open upstate. Further, New York expects only a 3.5-percent increase in new=  capacity in the next three to four years. Consequently, concerns about the=  state's ability to meet increasing demand for power have gained momentum. = Pressure has been placed on New York regulators to expedite the approval st= eps for siting new plants in the state. However, at the same time, environm= ental and community groups closely guard the proposals for new plants and o= ften lobby for limitations on how and where the new plant will produce powe= r.    While the entire state of New York is subject to shortages, the probl= em appears to be particularly acute in New York City. A November 2000 repor= t issued by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) entitled ""Inves= tigation of Bulk Power Markets, Northeast Region,"" highlighted specific cap= acity problems in the New York City/Long Island community of 11 million peo= ple. These areas are particularly vulnerable because they are isolated from=  most of the state's grid, the study said. Like Northern California, which = suffered rolling blackouts due to transmission constraints, New York City a= nd Long Island can only import limited quantities of power on constrained t= ransmission lines. Hydro and fossil resources are plentiful in upstate New = York, but cannot reach the city. Being both densely populated and heavily r= esidential, it is difficult to site new power plants in the area. Consequen= tly, 80 percent of the power that the city consumes is generated by the cit= y. New plants such as the one by Astoria Energy are being proposed because = New York City reportedly will be short of its generating capacity needs at = times during the course of 2002. The projected shortfall is expected to inc= rease by another 200 MW by summer 2002.    Increased demand is causing addi= tional problems for the energy markets of New York City and New York State.=  Demand in the state rose by 2,700 MW from 1995 to 2000, or 2.5 times as fa= st as new generation capacity was added. Demand over the course of 2001 was=  expected to reach 31,100 MW, or about 3.7 percent above regulators' earlie= r forecasts.    It is within this market context that Astoria Energy will p= roceed with its plans for the new power plant in New York City. Astoria Ene= rgy is a private company seeking to generate electric power with energy-eff= icient and environmentally sound technologies in the New York City area. Th= e company is a subsidiary of SCS Energy, a privately owned energy developme= nt company formed in 1998 for the purpose of developing and owning new elec= tric generating facilities. Information obtained from Astoria Energy sheds = some additional light on the proposed plant. As noted, the 1,000-MW unit wi= ll be a natural gas-fired facility, which will obtain natural gas supplied = from the ConEd/New York facility pipeline. The capital cost for the plant r= eportedly will be $600 million. Commercial operation, pending the necessary=  approvals on the local level, is scheduled for the fourth quarter of 2003.=  Astoria Energy is seemingly confident of its chances to gain approval for = the new plant because it will be using a technology that is specifically ge= ared toward the reduction of air emissions.    However, despite this optimi= sm, the community opposition factor should not be discounted, and there are=  several examples that may foreshadow the opposition that Astoria Energy co= uld face. Take Sithe Energies, for example, which hit a roadblock with its = construction plans in the New York area earlier this year. Sithe Energies o= riginally planned a 827-MW combined-cycle facility fueled by natural gas in=  Ramapo, N.Y. Chief among the concerns of local residents is that the Ramap= o plant was originally planned to run all the time to meet demand, and as a=  result would use local water resources for cooling purposes. Community res= istance thus became an issue for the company, which altered its plans and b= egan to consider a 510-MW peaking unit (also powered by natural gas) that w= ould only be operated in times of increased demand.     As another example,=  environmental and community groups won a victory in court just last week t= hat essentially will block construction of small power plants in the South = Bronx, Brooklyn, Queens, and Long Island areas. Each is a 44-MW plant, thou= gh at some sites there are twin generators operating at less than 80 MW.  A=  coalition of the groups had opposed the construction of various plants in = these areas and sued the New York Power Authority, claiming (among other th= ings) that the state had failed to perform adequate environmental-review st= udies. The groups claim that the state should test the plants for their out= put of fine particulate matter. A lower court had ruled in favor of the sta= te, but a judgment last week in the New York Court of Appeals was clearly a=  win for the environmental and community groups. The new ruling, which repo= rtedly cannot be appealed further, says that the state must do unprecedente= d air tests at the 10 plants or shut them down by Jan. 31.     In a report = issued earlier this year, New York State Electric & Gas Corp. (NYSEG), one = of New York's seven utilities, said the state will not have enough megawatt= s to support a truly competitive wholesale electric market until 2008. NYSE= G, in a report issued late Wednesday, warned there are ""serious problems wi= th (New York's) generation supply and a lack of transmission and pipeline i= nfrastructure."" According to data included in a separate report by the New = York ISO, which manages the state's transmission grid, between 1995 and 200= 0, while statewide demand in New York rose by 2,700 MW, generating capacity=  under contract in the state reportedly increased only by 1,060 MW.    Cons= equently, given all of these factors, power supplies in New York remained s= trained and the area certainly could benefit from the construction of new g= eneration capacity. However, Astoria Energy, which seeks to bring new gener= ation online in New York that will be based on clean technologies, may stil= l face an uphill battle from various groups that seemingly oppose the const= ruction of any new plants in the region (with the exception of peaker units= , whose output would be closely regimented). If plans for this plant are bl= ocked or significantly altered, following the experience of Sithe Energies,=  the options to resolve New York City's supply / demand imbalance will once=  again become focused on a combination of other approaches, including conse= rvation efforts and reliance on distributed generation alternatives.

"From time to time there have been discussions in the TIE list criticizing Con Edison for its involvement in out-of-merit actions, implying that it is inappropriate for Con Edison control room operators to make such requests. In its recent order on the Revised Local Mitigation Measures, FERC, in response to allegations made by Orion, ordered the NYISO to take responsibility for out-of-merit.  The Con Edison system has the world's most concentrated use of energy for residential and commercial purposes. It is also a highly transmission-constrained area where transfer limitations under normal and second contingency conditions require certain minimum generation levels within specific load pockets to assure reliability under existing reliability rules. One of the main functions of the Con Edison control center is to be vigilant of system conditions at all times and prevent the system from reaching an unreliable operating state. When such conditions are imminent, the Con Edison operator so advises the NYISO. Some parties have said that Con Edison operators should never make out-of-merit requests. Con Edison operators would be acting irresponsibly if they were to detect an imminent unreliable operating condition and just sit back and not inform the NYISO of the potential danger. Con Edison operators have been trained to focus on operating the New York City system. The NYISO operators have a much wider state-wide focus. It is entirely appropriate for both a transmission owner (TO) and NYISO operators to work cooperatively in maintaining reliability with the clear understanding that under the FERC-approved tariff, it is the NYISO that has sole responsibility for reliability. I would like to clarify that all involvement by Con Edison operators in out-of-merit actions are based on the following  FERC-approved process in which the NYISO, and not the TO operator, has sole responsibility for these actions.   The NYISO FERC Electric Tariff, Section 5.4,  Operations Under Adverse Conditions states in essence that:   * The NYISO shall operate the system in accordance with Reliability Rules, including local rules   * The NYISO will do this, among other measures, by adjusting generator output levels   * The NYISO has sole responsibility for declaring that Adverse Conditions are imminent   * Activation of these actions shall involve a two-step process    1. The TO involved will advise the NYISO that an Adverse Condition is imminent and recommend action    2. The NYISO activates the appropriate procedures   * Records of the activation of such procedures shall be maintained by both the TO and the NYISO  Having stated the above, let me also say that Con Edison has been working with NYISO operations to minimize the occurrences of conditions that require Con Edison operators to request actions that result in OOM operations. Con Edison supports current efforts by the NYISO to manage load pocket reliability events in a way that SCD can be used to maintain reliability with in-merit generation.  In effect, the FERC recent order does not require any change from present practice which is, and has always been, in compliance with Section 5.4 of the NYISO FERC Electric Tariff, and in compliance with FERC's recent order: the NYISO is solely responsible for out-of-merit actions.

"@TIMES - Inside NYTimes.com Tuesday, January 15, 2002 -----------------------------------------------------  Dear NYTimes.com Member,  One of the most meaningful features to appear in The New York Times and on NYTimes.com is Portraits of Grief. This feature first began running on September 15 and presented brief profiles of World Trade Center victims. On December 31 the final daily edition of Portraits of Grief appeared in The New York Times newspaper. A book will be published this year, and the feature will continue to appear from time to time, as more names become known and more families agree to interviews.  In the meantime, we invite you to visit the Web site to see a complete collection of Portraits of Grief, alphabetized and listed by day. This archive represents all the Portraits published to date. They will remain at NYTimes.com indefinitely.  http://www.nytimes.com/pages/national/portraits/?rd=hcmcp?p=041_Fz041_GM4Krtg012000mUxrvUxgm  Another recent special feature has been the multimedia photo essay. We have already talked here about the essays done by Vincent Laforet and James Hill. I would now like to direct your attention to the newest, this one by Times staff photographer Ruth Fremson about the women in Afghanistan. The essay features a very strong audio commentary, which makes the point that not all the women feel the same about the head-to-toe veil they were required to wear under the Taliban's rule: in fact, many are very comfortable dressed as they are.  http://www.nytimes.com/pages/national/dayofterror/index.html?rd=hcmcp?p=041_Ja041_GM4Krtg012000mUxrvUxgm  We have enjoyed participating in almost daily ""conversations"" with correspondents of The New York Times. In these unstructured talks, each correspondent provides information not only about the news he or she is covering, but on what life is like in the particular place he or she is located. There are over 50 discussions now available for listening in audio format.  http://www.nytimes.com/2001/10/23/national/_begwer-audio.html?rd=hcmcp?p=041_FW041_GM4Krtg012000mUxrvUxgm  The Winter Olympics games at Salt Lake City begin soon and NYTimes.com already has started covering this event. Our Olympics section covers security concerns, athlete profiles and an interactive map of the torch relay. Special e-mail updates are now available, and include periodic countdown reports and details of the torch run, athlete profiles and event previews. When the games begin on Feb. 8, we'll send daily dispatches with event results and exclusive ""postcards"" from Salt Lake City by Times sports reporter George Vecsey.  http://www.nytimes.com/pages/olympics/index.html?rd=hcmcp?p=041_Ev041_GM4Krtg012000mUxrvUxgm  I would also like to invite you to explore these new features on NYTimes.com:  1. Introducing The New York Times Job Market 2. Know the deal with DealBook 3. New Topics of The Times collections now available 4. The Outlook for business and the markets in 2002 5. Join in for N.F.L. playoffs 6. Best of 2001 in the arts 7. For students, ""TEST"" doesn't have to be a four-letter word  ------ 1. Introducing The New York Times Job Market ------  If you're serious about finding a new job, NYTimes.com is a better resource than ever.

Know the deal with DealBook ------  NYTimes.com's daily look at the world of mergers and acquisitions, private capital, I.P.O's and more has been expanded in a new, easier-to-use HTML format. Delivered daily via e-mail, this popular newsletter edited by Andrew Ross Sorkin now has even more features to help you know the deal on Wall Street and around the world. Sign up for free now.  http://www.nytimes.com/email#dealbook?rd=hcmcp?p=041_EL041_GM4Krtg012000mUxrvUxgm  ------ 3. New Topics of The Times collections now available ------  Our Topics of the Times series has expanded. The new collections include:  -- Thomas Friedman on Sept. 11 -- Authors in Depth: V.S. Naipaul -- Winter Desserts -- Destination Hawaii  Each collection contains up to nine archived articles and can be purchased for $4.95 at:  http://www.nytimes.com/timestopics/?rd=hcmcp?p=041_Cl041_GM4Krtg012000mUxrvUxgm  ------ 4. The Outlook for business and the markets in 2002 ------  After two years of poor returns, investors may have a better time in 2002 as an economic recovery looks more and more possible. Every January, we publish the annual economic Outlook section, which includes useful articles by the New York Times staff.  http://www.nytimes.com/outlook?rd=hcmcp?p=041_Bz041_GM4Krtg012000mUxrvUxgm  ------ 5. Join in for N.F.L. playoffs ------  From the first round of the playoffs on Jan. 12 until Super Bowl Sunday on Jan. 27, NYTimes.com will have complete coverage of the N.F.L. playoffs, including features, opinion, game coverage, statistics, audio and extended use of Times photography.  http://www.nytimes.com/pages/sports/football/index.html?rd=hcmcp?p=041_Bd041_GM4Krtg012000mUxrvUxgm  ------ 6. Best of 2001 in the arts ------  The critics of The New York Times review the year in the arts, including top 10 lists for the year's best movies, albums and television shows.  http://www.nytimes.com/indexes/2001/12/30/arts/index.html?rd=hcmcp?p=041_AW041_GM4Krtg012000mUxrvUxgm  ------ 7. For students, ""TEST"" doesn't have to be a four-letter word ------  The Learning Network's Word of the Day and Test Prep Question of the Day help students build their vocabulary for upcoming standardized tests in ways that are fun and interactive. Every weekday there's a focus on a different word -- its definition and an example of its use in the context of a recent Times article; and students can then test their understanding online with the day's analogy or sentence completion question.  http://www.nytimes.com/learning/students/wordofday/?rd=hcmcp?p=041_L4041_GM4Krtg012000mUxrvUxgm   Thanks for your time.

" It would appear that the plague of OOM requests that have distorted prices in New York may soon be reduced to the point that a true market may evolve and introduce some interest in serving load without the unhedgable risk of ""uplift charges"".  The difficulty in looking ahead is to determine what the real prices will be without the numerous OOM requests that have been made in the past. The information that has been published in the past with regard to generation OOM did not quantify how much generation was removed from the bid stack at any one time. Certainly a significant number of  peak hours were affected but it is unknown to what degree. At a guess a number of hours probably had over 1000 MW of generation OOM, effectively removing this generation from the bid stack but showing up as ""uplift charges"" on that portion of the electricity bill.  Two pieces of information would be extremely helpful in taking a stab at what the energy prices should have been/are without the large OOM shadow bilateral market that presently exists.  1. How much generation in aggregate was loaded OOM for each hour in each zone? 2. Approximately how much was the uplift assigned to each zone on a daily basis?  On a side note it is interesting to note that there is a recent presentation to the AMP/ICM Task Force by one of the participants that has determined that if all the large suppliers collude in tandem to withhold 50 MW each that there could conceivably be an increase in price. While this conspiracy theory is of concern to said presenter it would seem highly unlikely, especially considering that bid load or exports provide a much higher impact on price in reality than the unlikely scenario of some large suppliers all colluding in tandem. What should be of concern does not seem to be on their radar screen. Why are there so many OOM requests in NYC alone? Despite the more complex system in NYC the number of requests is significant. The resultant distortion in price has the result of making a market that is very difficult to predict and very difficult to hedge. The uplift charges assigned to those trying to serve load can be devastating, well that is those without the ability to pass it through. An interesting market development has resulted from the numerous OOM requests. The numerous OOM requests have translated into unhedgeable uplift that deters retail competition. The result of a lack of retail competition would be that customers would continue to reside with the incumbent provider instead of with another retail provider. While this may not be the intent of OOM requests it is realistically the result and one that should be garnering the attention of regulators to a higher degree than other theoretical scenarios.  The continued practice to over regulate this market will deter generator development. I have heard some arguments that the CAP market in NYC will ensure investment and construction of new generation. To be clear the argument pointed to the current cap of ~$112/kw/year and that this would ensure that generation would be developed. ICAP payments are not a guaranteed revenue stream to any generator, especially payments of $9.40/kw/month. New generation will result in more competition for the payments which will result in lower capacity prices, especially in the longer term. There is only a fixed amount of load and reductions in ICAP prices do not result in an increase in demand for ICAP, prices will come down; a review of the recent ICAP auctions proves that this true. The larger the assumption for ICAP payments in a new generator development proforma, the increased risk that is assumed going forward, especially in light of the high regulatory risk in this market. A 25% decline in ICAP payments would be devastating to a proforma that relied heavily on ICAP as a revenue stream. Certainly the recent auction clearing prices suggest that the volatility is greater than 25% and therefore concludes that an assumption for high ICAP revenues are not a substitute for a viable and competitive energy market. Certainly looking at the current forward prices, the surplus of ICAP and the mitigated volatility it will not be long before generators with low capacity factors and high maintenance costs will be closely examining the economics of continuing to participate in the market.  In conclusion the modeling of the 138 KV in NYC promises to reduce OOM requests by 70%, hopefully this will be the result. Certainly a significant increase in information for OOM requests should be posted that should include what load pocket, how much generation is loaded OOM and any other information that is pertinent including a mechanism to request an audit of those OOM requests to determine their validity. If all the requests are always valid then there should not be a problem subjecting requests to an audit. OOM requests are a deviation from the market based software dispatch, these exceptions to the normal dispatch should be examined as closely as generators are scrutinized when they deviate from their scheduled dispatches.

"Joel  My apologies if I mischaracterized the presentation, I simply interpreted this excerpt from the PSC presentation..  As can be seen from the spreadsheet, no single supplier, withholding 50 MW, can, on its own, cause the price to rise by the $100 needed to breach the AMP's $100 price impact threshold. But, if a number of large players, each acting unilaterally, withhold 50 MW due to the profitability of doing so, the combined effect on price could be over $100, which would be both very damaging to buyers, and very profitable to suppliers.  In my simple interpretation of the NYISO Market Monitoring Plan it is a measure of conduct and impact.  As follows from the Market Monitoring Plan..  2.1  Conduct Subject to Mitigation  Mitigation Measures may be applied: (i) to the bidding, scheduling or operation of an ""Electric Facility,"" defined for purposes of this Addendum to the Plan as an electric generation resource or transmission facility; or (ii) as specified in ? 2.3(b)).  2.3. Categories of Conduct that May Warrant Mitigation  a) The following categories of conduct, whether by a single firm or by multiple firms acting in concert, may cause a material effect on prices or guarantee payments in a New York Electric Market if exercised from a position of market power. Accordingly, the NYISO shall monitor the New York Electric Markets for the following categories of conduct, and shall impose appropriate Mitigation Measures if such conduct is detected and the other applicable conditions for the imposition of Mitigation.   You state that one generator witholding 50 MW does not warrant mitigation but a number of firms acting ""unilaterally"" would have an impact and should be mitigated. The NYISO however according to section 2.3 (in my interpretation of the Plan) a witholding of 50 MW (using your MW value) by multiple firms cannot be market power if they are not acting in concert. You admit that they are acting unilaterally and not acting in concert. If that is the case the only way these firms should be mitigated is if they are colluding or acting in concert.  Potentially splitting hairs here and I have no intention of swapping interpretations of the Market Monitoring Plan when it is clearly the function of the NYISO market Monitoring Unit, but what is the PSC's position on one market participant trying to export 500 or 1000 MW to multiple export points out of the NYISO; will this not have an impact on price, is this market power because prices may go up? Hopefully market power is not defined by high prices but by conduct as defined in the Plan.  Regards..

Dad: I heard that CIN summer is down to $32 - $33.  Gas is going to be below $2.00 for the summer by March.  Looks like your idea to short the whole year at $32.00 was a very good idea.  Again make sure your guys are looking at it right.  I think summer CIN will get to be around $28 before April and thats when you start buying it up.  Let me know what you think.  Merrill came out with a good report on you guys today.  I need to talk to you about a couple of things.  Please give me a call at home when you get the chance.

Bidding and Scheduling pages will be updated in style to match the look and feel of the public web site.  The process for posting prices will be updated to make it more efficient. This will have no effect on how prices are calculated or presented.  Changes will also be made to the real-time system in preparation for the move of the Rockland Electric load to the PJM control area.

"This article from NYTimes.com has been sent to you by gwoulfe@enron.com.    The Flipped-Over Rock  February 21, 2002  By WILLIAM SAFIRE     WASHINGTON -- What wife of a United States senator profited from her close association with a big company that did heavy lobbying of the federal government and then went bust, costing investors billions and workers their jobs?  Why, Wendy Gramm, most recently awakened watchdogs would say, wife of the Republican Phil Gramm of Texas, previous chairman of the Banking Committee. As a director of Enron, she was on the audit committee that didn't question the fast-and- loose auditing, and (subtracting the deferred compensation that went into the tank) received about $220,000 over eight years.  That's peanuts, say Republicans. The senatorial wife who hit it big was Anne Bingaman, married to New Mexico's Jeff Bingaman, chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee. As lobbyist for the telecommunications comet Global Crossing, which went bankrupt last month, she received $2,500,000 for six months' work during 1999.  Both senatorial wives are accomplished executives who parlayed responsible government appointments into lucrative private positions.  Wendy Gramm was chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. Anne Bingaman was Bill Clinton's assistant attorney general for antitrust until leaving in June 1996. Her lobbying fee for delaying approval of a competitor's undersea cable still makes Beltway bandits gasp.  This juxtaposition shows that the Enron scandal is having only bipartisan political fallout; in this case, the ""everybody did it"" defense works. (You can bet that neither spouse will be subpoenaed and publicly humiliated by the club member Fritz Hollings at the Commerce Committee.) Because both the biggest bankrupt (Enron) and the fourth-biggest bankrupt (Global Crossing) made contributions to politicians of both parties, the resulting public disgust has been used to advance bipartisan campaign finance reform.  Enron, which mostly embarrassed Republicans, has been wrung dry in the media; the sight of the tilted ""E"" symbol elicits yawns from viewers. It's the telecommunications giant Global Crossing's turn in the barrel; now we'll be hearing about Clinton connections on its board and its boss's million-dollar contribution to the Clinton library.  Especially delicious will be the examination of Terry McAuliffe, the fabled fund-raiser whom Bill Clinton insisted the Democratic National Committee take on as chairman. McAuliffe says he merely invested $100,000 in Global Crossing and sold it for $18 million, and what's the big deal? What his D.N.C. spokesman won't say is what price per share he paid before the company went public, and what that stock was worth when it went on the market - and what he did to earn the difference. (Same question could be directed to Bush the elder.)  But after the politicians tire of wounding each other and declare a truce, we may see some overdue action on the control of financial derivatives. These are the investments, often off the books, in futures and currencies that slice and dice risk and have made instant billionaires, but whose abuse has been disastrous to investors from Orange County to Long-Term Capital Management.  Hedge funds are supposed to spread and reduce risk; in reality, they are often used to make huge bets unknown to their institutional investors. Accountants are supposed to enforce disclosure of all liabilities, but many have become expert in the concealment of risk.  I don't profess to understand the worries some of my financial sources express about dangerous excesses in the convertible bond market, ""swaptions"" and ever-narrowing derivatives. But my unwillingness to break my head learning these intricacies gives the wheeler-dealers an edge. Complication and secrecy are mother's milk to them, while the average investor's best protection is full disclosure.  When you flip over a flat rock like Enron or Global Crossing, you see much panicky scurrying-about by those who like to work in the dark. For too long, new-economy corporate creeps and their accounting Heeps have hidden risk in arcane off-the-books dealing. The new S.E.C. chairman, Harvey Pitt, seems not to get it: Stop pretending it's a political scandal and start dealing with the accounting and derivatives scandal.  http://www.nytimes.com/2002/02/21/opinion/21SAFI.html?ex=1015395556&ei=1&en=2af09e94be84eaa6    HOW TO ADVERTISE --------------------------------- For information on advertising in e-mail newsletters or other creative advertising opportunities with The New York Times on the Web, please contact onlinesales@nytimes.com or visit our online media kit at http://www.nytimes.com/adinfo  For general information about NYTimes.com, write to help@nytimes.com.

"Dear Market Participants,  NERC announced a delay in the implementation of E-Tag Version 1.7 from March 6, 2002 to April 10, 2002.  This delay is necessitated by vendor inter-operability problems experienced during dress rehearsals on February 14 and February 21.  These problems could adversely impact reliability and hamper the marketplace.  The NYISO will implement E-Tag Version 1.7 in tandem with NERC.  NYISO Market Participants should ensure that their respective Agent Services are upgraded to the new version, should complete their TSIN registration, and are encouraged to participate in the remaining dress rehearsals to the extent possible.  NERC is conducting a survey of the preparedness of Industry Participants for the planned implementation of E-Tag Version 1.7.  Market Participants are also asked to complete this survey.  The responses to the survey received thus fare are posted on the NERC website.  Attached below are additional details and instructions for the implementation of E-Tag Version 1.7.  If you have questions about New York- or Northeast-specific issues, please call the Customer Relations Help Desk at 518-356-6060 or email Karl Tammar at ktammar@nyiso.com.

"An audit of the price verification and correction process has revealed some instances of problems related to coordinating the ECA-A and B end-state process with the price reservation and correction procedures carried out by the NYISO's consultant.  The affected days were 1, 2, 4, 9, 10, 21, 29, and 31 January 2002 and 1, 7, and 8 February 2002.  There were two problems of coordination, each distinct but related to the other.  In certain hours on days requiring internal price corrections, tables containing the ECA-A adjustments at the external proxy buses were inadvertently joined to the real-time tables, overwriting some real-time information with the BME information.  The overwrite took place prior to the posting of the corrected prices on the web.  The consequence was that a database that was supposed to contain only real-time information contained a mix of real-time and BME information.  The second problem resulted from the NYISO consistently using an ""hour-beginning"" timeframe for the ECA-A and B end-state and other processes, while the correction process that overwrote the information (see above) used an ""hour-ending"" timeframe.  The consequence was that certain top-of-the-hour intervals were corrected inappropriately and not subsequently overwritten by the NYISO-originated end-state ECA correction.  The NYISO apologizes for any confusion that these correction adjustments have caused.   --- You are currently subscribed to nyiso_tie as: benjamin.rogers@enron.com To unsubscribe send a blank email to leave-nyiso_tie-628650Q@lyris.nyiso.com",benjamin.rogers@enron.com,cgoering@nyiso.com,ECA-Related Price Correction,2002-02-28 12:03:02-08:00,received

"  The continuing promises to reduce OOM requests by the NYISO would seem to be nothing more than empty verbage. I am referring to the continued multitude of OOM dispatches that are requested every day by either ConEd and the NYISO.  Any request for generation OOM is bypassing the SCD dispatch algorithm. The requests are so frequent that it makes one wonder if SCD is capable of dispatching the system at all. Generation is consistently requested OOM into any pickup hour whether in the morning or the evening, this can mean one of two things either SCD is significantly flawed and cannot handle any system condition in which the system is marginally stressed or that operator intervention into the dispatch process is for price control and not for system security.  The nebulous and overused rationale of ""requested OOM for ISO or local security"" lacks detail and any rationale. An OOM request is a special exception to the dispatch algorithm as afforded in the tariff to allow resolution of a system condition that SCD cannot resolve. Since these requests are requested so frequently you have to assume that SCD is inherently flawed.  Yes the 138 KV modeling may go in service in the near future but will it really reduce the OOM calls. ConEd has a carte blanche to load generation whatever and whenever they want, even when it is not in their transmission district (Roseton OOM dispatch). There is no justification required and clearly it is in their economic interest to request generation OOM. Controls and the capability to audit these requests are required to mitigate the load server with 40% of the New York State load to cease and desist bypassing the SCD dispatch algorithm.  The consistent use of the NYPA GTs, the Gilboa generators, etc. are a consistent abuse of a loophole in the tariff that allow interference into the system dispatch unchecked and without any published rationale. I would only assume that if a generator abused the dispatch to the same extent they would have been thrown in mitigation jail a long time ago.

"I talked with your Dad a couple of days ago and he said you were coming North.  I wish you the beswt and I am sorry things ended this way.  Hopefully you learned alot while you were here.  Please keep in touch.  Stan   -----Original Message----- From:  Rogers, Benjamin   Sent: Thursday, February 28, 2002 2:59 PM To: Horton, Stanley Subject: Leaving!  Stan: Its been a very interesting ride these last four and a half years here.  I received an offer from UBS, but decided to turn it down for personal reasons.  These last few weeks I have been with the estate working on selling certain assets.  Tomorrow is my last day with the estate and then I am off to Ohio and Cinergy to continue trading.  I will also begin to learn the oprations of Cinergy as well as go back and get an executive MBA at Chicago.  Ultimately, I want to learn more about the overall operations and effective energy risk management.   I just wanted to thank you for all you have done while I have been here.  I look back and think that I should have spent time in the pipeline group.  Even after all that has happened I certainly wouldn't change what I have experienced.  Thanks again for being such a good friend.  Hope you are doing well and good luck with everything.  I will send you my new information at Cinergy.  My Dad would love to hear from you sometime.

"Dear Market Participants,  The NYISO encountered problems with SCD last night as a result of the code changes to transfer the Rockland Electric load to PJM.  The NYISO entered Back-up Dispatch System mode around 4:30 a.m.and remained there until about 8:00 a.m.  We are currently using SCD for dispatch, and the transfer of the Rockland Electric load has been completed.  Market Monitioring will place additional monitoring focus on the HAM to ensure competitive market results in the event that problems with SCD re-occur.  If you have any questions, please call your Customer Relations Representative or the Customer Relations Help Desk at 518-356-6060.
