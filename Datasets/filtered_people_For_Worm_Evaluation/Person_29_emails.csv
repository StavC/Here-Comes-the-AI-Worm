Here is some information that you probably are already aware of, but just in case......  You may recall that Com Ed sold all of their coal-fired units and gas fired units to EME (Edison Mission Energy). I don't remember exactly how many megawatts are now owned and controlled by Mission, but it is between 15,000 and 20,000 MW throughout Northern Illinois.   Mission's union has authorized a strike to be effective June 1.  Unlike Peoples, Mission does not have many management employees in the Chicago area (Mission is a California-based corporation).  Therefore the odds of the plants remaining in operation during a strike are low.  They would likely keep a couple of key plants on, and the rest would idle.  Power prices currently do not support operation of Allegheny or Constellation, but a large outage may change that.  Bill Quigley has some good contacts that have been keeping him up to date on the status of this. If they strike we may see Allegheny, Constellation and Elwood fire even when weather is not extreme.  --Tim  ---------------------------------------------------------------- The information transmitted is intended only for the person or entity to which it is addressed and may contain confidential and/or privileged material.

"I don't agree with either 7 or 8.   The 0.1 LOLP generally results in 20-25% reserve margins which are excessive.   Reserve margin is a meaningless measure in an efficient commodity market because supply and demand adjust to price signals to keep the market in balance.  My view is that ICAP should be eliminated completely and, if utilized, transitional only for a 1-2 year period.   The other alternative is the ISO to have a reliability auction whereby quick-start units contract directly with an ISO for meeting reliability reserve reqs.   -----Original Message----- From:  Hoatson, Tom   Sent: Wednesday, May 30, 2001 9:48 AM To: Aucoin, Berney C.; Decker, Charles; Nicolay, Christi; Baughman, Edward D.; Steffes, James; Scheuer, Janelle; Thompkins, Jason; Ader, Jeff; Meyn, Jim; Quenet, Joe; Presto, Kevin M.; Bernstein, Mark; Davis, Mark Dana; Hamlin, Mason; Politis, Nick; Broderick, Paul J.; Hammond, Pearce; Martinez, Posey; Wheeler, Rob; sscott3@enron.com; Novosel, Sarah; Montovano, Steve Cc: Allegretti, Daniel; Fromer, Howard Subject: EPSA Draft Paper on Assuring Adequate Capacity in a Competitive Market  Below is the draft white paper prepared by EPSA as a result of the workshop held on May 15 on assuring adequate capacity (discussed in a previous email from me).  The purpose of the paper is to outline possible EPSA positions on the issues.  EPSA could would like comments on the paper by Monday, June 4 (you could forward them to me and I will pass them on to EPSA).  In summary the paper presents 14 principals for assuring adequate capacity that I believe Enron could support.  Most of the principals discuss a liquid, efficient energy market and robust forward markets are capable of assuring adequate capacity; load needs to see prices and demand needs to respond; barriers to construction of new generation and entry for LSE's need to be eliminated; and any capacity market must be designed to create a level playing field between old and new market entrants.  The most controversial are #7 and #8.    Number 7 states:  ""During a limited transition to fully competitive markets, an administratively-determined mandatory reserve requirement can serve to ensure that adequate capacity is available to meet reliability needs within politically acceptable limits of price volatility.  A mandated reserve requirement should be tied to specific reliability criteria for that system, such as the one day in ten years loss of load probability.""   Number 8 states:  ""Suppliers must be fully compensated for supplying needed reserves.  This can be accomplished through a well-designed Installed Capacity (ICAP) market, a separate capacity market, imbalance trading or call options.""  ----- Forwarded by Tom Hoatson/NA/Enron on 05/30/2001 09:31 AM -----    ""Jackie Gallagher"" <JGallagher@epsa.org> 05/29/2001 03:32 PM     To: <acomnes@enron.com>, <bhawkin@enron.com>, <carin.nersesian@enron.com>, <christi.l.nicolay@enron.com>, <donna.fulton@enron.com>, <janelle.scheuer@enron.com>, <jhartso@enron.com>, <john.shelk@enron.com>, <jsteffe@enron.com>, <Linda.J.Noske@enron.com>, <ray.alvarez@enron.com>, <rshapiro@enron.com>, <Sarah.Novosel@enron.com>, <sscott3@enron.com>, <Susan.J.Mara@enron.com>, <tom.hoatson@enron.com>  cc:   Subject: EPSA Draft Paper on Assuring Adequate Capacity in a Competitive Market     MEMORANDUM  TO: Regulatory Affairs Committee        Power Marketers Working Group  FROM: Jim Steffes, Regulatory Affairs Committee Chair             Bob Reilley, Power Marketing Working Group Chair             Julie Simon, Vice President of Policy  DATE: May 29, 2001  RE: EPSA Draft Paper on Assuring Adequate Capacity in a       Competitive Market       ?

Cc: Will, Lloyd; Tholan, Scott; Holman, Kelly Subject: Union Update 5/30/01 Importance: High  The below information gives a brief update of the current situation between Local 15 and Midwest.  We expect to have additional information tomorrow from our sources.    Sources report the following: Local 15 is currently in the planning stages of a strike and are hoping that while this process is going on, negotiations will start with Midwest.   The real issue with Local 15 is when Midwest purchased ComEd, they assumed all ComEd agreements with the labor union.  However, the labor union feels Midwest has not complied with this agreement and at this point Local 15 is using the threat of a strike to get Midwest's attention.   IBEW sanctioned a strike last Friday and took this action as a sign of support for the Local 15.  The IBEW support gives the Local 15 bargaining power in their discussions with Midwest.  The hope is that the possibility of a strike will put enough pressure on Midwest to get them to the negotiation table.  Chicago's Local 15 union is a compilation of 7 local unions. Since Midwest took ownership of the plants, there has been 45 cases brought before the grievance committee and all 45 cases have been referred to arbitration. These cases were filed due to the labor unions perception of Midwest not following the original labor contract.  Currently, the labor union lacks the funds for this costly procedure.  Prior to Midwest, ComEd and the labor unions were able to work out grievances. The IBEW has filed a complaint with the National Labor Relations Board claiming Midwest is unwilling to negotiate.  The hearing is scheduled for July 10th.  ",j..sturm@enron.com,m..presto@enron.com,FW: Union Update 5/30/01,2001-05-30 17:44:28-07:00,sent

The link is embedded in one of the messages below.  The Neptune Regional Electrical Transmission System will connect rapidly growing, electric-load centers in New York City, downtown Boston, and the Connecticut and New Jersey shores with clean and efficient electric generating facilities in Eastern Canada and Maine.  Employing state of the art, environmentally proven sub-sea cable technology, the Neptune System will overcome constraints to the existing land-based electric transmission grid which hinder the efficient use of energy resources along the Mid and North Atlantic seaboard.

We'll be auctioning off transmission rights in these corridors in September (assuming FERC approves our filing), which confronts traders with a complex array of valuation problems (the long-term value of the right to ship energy along these DC pathways and to collect ancillary services in each of the markets). It's a conceptually difficult challenge for most companies but I'm sure Enron is all over it. We'll be interested in whether or not Enron's traders participate in this auction.  We are also pre-selling some of the capacity in negotiations over the summer, in the expectation of FERC approval of that concept (kind of an anchor tenant concept).  As you will recall, we did approach Enron early on in the project (a fellow in Calgary whose name I cannot remember) and he indicated no interest. I'll keep you in the loop because I suspect you'll find the intellectual challenge intriguing -- what is access to DC capacity worth? --- as I do.  Hope things are going well in all of your markets!

The plan includes more than $420 million of transmission facility additions and reinforcements to ensure the continued reliable delivery of electricity in the region and to enhance the robustness of the PJM energy and capacity markets. PJM operates one of the largest electricity grids in the nation - a region that includes all or parts of PA, NJ, DE, MD, VA and D.C. The PJM RTEP, the only such process of its kind in the nation, consolidates the region's transmission needs into a uniform, comprehensive strategy.  The RTEP is unique as it is: *   Driven by the comprehensive transmission service needs of the region, *   Developed based on input from an inclusive group of stakeholders - including transmission owners, generation developers, market participants and representatives from state regulatory bodies, *   Recommended by the PJM staff, following extensive evaluation performed in coordination with PJM transmission owners, to ensure the plan meets the needs of the PJM transmission system in the most efficient and effective manner,  *   Reviewed by all stakeholders in the region through the PJM Transmission Expansion Advisory Committee, and *   Reviewed and approved by the PJM Board of Managers for implementation. ""The RTEP delivers real results through transmission enhancements and expansions in order to meet the generation and growth needs of the mid-Atlantic region for the next 10 years,"" said Phillip Harris, PJM chief executive officer and president. ""In short, this plan ensures bulk power reliability for our region."" PJM's Board of Managers approved the first RTEP in August 2000. As a result of that plan, approximately $300 million of transmission facility additions and reinforcements are currently in design or construction to, in part, accommodate the interconnection of more than 15,000 megawatts of new generating capacity to the PJM region. This second, updated plan includes transmission upgrades to ensure the continuing compliance of the PJM system with regional reliability criteria and to accommodate the interconnection of 43 generation projects, amounting to more than 12,500 megawatts of new generating capacity. The two phases of the plan, approved to date, now include more than $720 million of transmission infrastructure investments and accommodate more than 27,500 megawatts of new generating capacity within the PJM region. The PJM Board of Managers, an independent, eight-member board that has no financial interest in any PJM member, oversees the direction of the PJM office and is responsible for ensuring the safe and reliable operation of the robust and competitive PJM wholesale power market. PJM operates the world's largest competitive wholesale electricity market and one of North America's largest power grids. The company currently coordinates a pooled generating capacity of more than 58,000 megawatts and operates a wholesale electricity market with more than 200 market buyers, sellers and traders of electricity. PJM has administered more than $5 billion in energy and energy service trades since the regional markets opened in 1997. More than 70 nations have sent delegates to PJM to learn about the market model and the operation of the grid in the mid-Atlantic states.  ######     Please DO NOT REPLY to this message.

Cc: Herndon, Rogers; Richter, Jeff Subject: FYI - Progress Report on testing an EES deal in Enpower   To all,  The following is documentation of a sample EES deal which was tested in the Enpower system.  This is for informational purposes only.  Please let me know if you have any questions, or need clarification on any points.    Over the last few weeks, a few of us have been working to test an EES deal in Enpower (St. Luke's - Roosevelt, part of the Beth Israel deal).  The deal is a fixed price sale in New York City (Zone J) of Energy, Line Losses, Ancillary's, and ICAP.  The T&D is a pass through.  We only tested one site out of the ten.  Needless to say, this is probably one of the simplest structures available.  Obviously, we have worked on a few other things at the same time, so it has taken longer than we expected, but I hope this will help highlight how difficult it is to book EES deals in Enpower in it's current state.  Quick statistics for ONE site:  Each month of hourly data, takes 5-6 minutes to save.  We booked 100 months (approx 8.3 years), therefore each deal type (energy, ancillary, etc.) took 8-9 hours to book. Since each deal type takes 8-9 hours to book, it takes a total of 25-26 hours to book energy, ancillary's (only 1), line losses, and ICAP (this is not booked hourly, therefore, it only takes 1 hour to book). Although we booked only one ancillary position, most markets have at least four, therefore the total booking time should be closer to 50 hours. Once we got a book to run, it took 25 minutes to calculate the value. All of the above statistics assume there are no errors in entering the deals.  Recommendations:  Work with Anthony Dayao to set up a system that can handle these trades for position management, valuation, reporting, scheduling, settlements, accounting, etc. In the interim:  Enhance RPS to make the valuation consistent with the batch valuation process.  This includes strengthening information for position and DPR reporting.  As well, create tools to help identify change in valuation due to curve shift, reg switch options, and new deals. Enhance Intramonth valuation and reporting (East desk does not currently have an intramonth book). Integrate the Tariff Valuation and Reporting.  Currently, this is done in a stand-alone spreadsheet application. Support the Curve Database project which will allow the breakdown of curves into its components (as opposed to current bundled curves). Move all the EPMI hedges to Enpower.  All hedges will become desk to desk instead of being entered in both RPS and Enpower.  Position and P&L reports will have be integrated between Enpower and RPS.     Here is a breakdown of what it took to 'rebook' this trade:  Week 1 (May 14-18)  Read Contract. Get Batch model, as well as a breakdown of value between Energy, Ancillary's, etc. Sit with Underwriting to answer questions about Load growth and contractual questions. Work on Wholesale Full Requirements model (in Excel) to check valuation.  Week 2 (May 21-25)  Continue working on Full Requirements model. Work with Risk Management (Stacey White's group) to set up delivery points and curves in Enpower.  Begin to book deal in Enpower - Getting access to Enpower took some time. Discovered that our assumption on hours for the 12x12 was incorrect.   We had gotten about 1/3 of the deal booked by the time we realized this. At times, the database tables would run out of space, because we have never entered a deal of this size in the test database.  This would keep us from entering any new data.  Week 3 (May 29-June 1)  Finished Excel Full Requirements model.  The EES Batch and the Wholesale model tie out except for some minor differences on discounting and ICAP.  The current ICAP curves are            $/MW-day, and they are not calculated using the correct numbers of days (i.e. June and July have the same MW/day price, even though there are 30 and 31 days, respectively, in each month).  This can be fixed in the curve files.  In the future we should mark the curves as $/Kw-month. Again, we ran into problems with the test database. Completed booking in Enpower.  Week 4 (June 4-5)  Took 2 days to get a MTM valuation (portcalc) to work. Discovered deal entry errors in booking.

Cc:=09Herndon, Rogers; Richter, Jeff Subject:=09FYI - Progress Report on testing an EES deal in Enpower   To all,  The following is documentation of a sample EES deal which was tested in the=  Enpower system.  This is for informational purposes only.  Please let me k= now if you have any questions, or need clarification on any points. =20  Over the last few weeks, a few of us have been working to test an EES deal = in Enpower (St. Luke's - Roosevelt, part of the Beth Israel deal).  The dea= l is a fixed price sale in New York City (Zone J) of Energy, Line Losses, A= ncillary's, and ICAP.  The T&D is a pass through.  We only tested one site = out of the ten.  Needless to say, this is probably one of the simplest stru= ctures available.  Obviously, we have worked on a few other things at the s= ame time, so it has taken longer than we expected, but I hope this will hel= p highlight how difficult it is to book EES deals in Enpower in it's curren= t state.  Quick statistics for ONE site:  Each month of hourly data, takes 5-6 minutes to save.  We booked 100 months=  (approx 8.3 years), therefore each deal type (energy, ancillary, etc.) too= k 8-9 hours to book. Since each deal type takes 8-9 hours to book, it takes a total of 25-26 hou= rs to book energy, ancillary's (only 1), line losses, and ICAP (this is not=  booked hourly, therefore, it only takes 1 hour to book). Although we booked only one ancillary position, most markets have at least = four, therefore the total booking time should be closer to 50 hours. Once we got a book to run, it took 25 minutes to calculate the value. All of the above statistics assume there are no errors in entering the deal= s.  Recommendations:  Work with Anthony Dayao to set up a system that can handle these trades for=  position management, valuation, reporting, scheduling, settlements, accoun= ting, etc. In the interim:  Enhance RPS to make the valuation consistent with the batch valuation proce= ss.  This includes strengthening information for position and DPR reporting= .  As well, create tools to help identify change in valuation due to curve = shift, reg switch options, and new deals. Enhance Intramonth valuation and reporting (East desk does not currently ha= ve an intramonth book). Integrate the Tariff Valuation and Reporting.  Currently, this is done in a=  stand-alone spreadsheet application. Support the Curve Database project which will allow the breakdown of curves=  into its components (as opposed to current bundled curves). Move all the EPMI hedges to Enpower.  All hedges will become desk to desk i= nstead of being entered in both RPS and Enpower.  Position and P&L reports = will have be integrated between Enpower and RPS. =09   Here is a breakdown of what it took to 'rebook' this trade:  Week 1 (May 14-18)  Read Contract. Get Batch model, as well as a breakdown of value between Energy, Ancillary'= s, etc. Sit with Underwriting to answer questions about Load growth and contractual=  questions. Work on Wholesale Full Requirements model (in Excel) to check valuation.  Week 2 (May 21-25)  Continue working on Full Requirements model. Work with Risk Management (Stacey White's group) to set up delivery points = and curves in Enpower.=09 Begin to book deal in Enpower - Getting access to Enpower took some time. Discovered that our assumption on hours for the 12x12 was incorrect.   We h= ad gotten about 1/3 of the deal booked by the time we realized this. At times, the database tables would run out of space, because we have never=  entered a deal of this size in the test database.  This would keep us from=  entering any new data.  Week 3 (May 29-June 1)  Finished Excel Full Requirements model.  The EES Batch and the Wholesale mo= del tie out except for some minor differences on discounting and ICAP.  The=  current ICAP curves are            $/MW-day, and they are not calculated u= sing the correct numbers of days (i.e. June and July have the same MW/day p= rice, even though there are 30 and 31 days, respectively, in each month).  = This can be fixed in the curve files.  In the future we should mark the cur= ves as $/Kw-month. Again, we ran into problems with the test database. Completed booking in Enpower.

The effect is an additional $1.2MM a year of depreciation for 2001.  I am not sure what Kevin is looking at, but Jenny's 2001 Plan had $17.4MM and we are currently forecasting $17.3MM for 2001.  With regard to the Capital Charge issue.  The interest rate that we were told to use by Delainey was 9% - we have since found out that Lavo is using 8.5% - therefore, in June we will credit the New Albany project with $218K of interest.  Again, Jenny's plan showed $11.8 and the 2001 forecast is $11.8(using 8.5%).  The estimate using 8% is $10.7MM.  Finally, there is only $54K remaining in New Albany's major maintenance account.  We stopped booking a per start accrual sometime last year on all of the Peakers since none of the plants except New Albany were using the reserve.  If my memory serves me correctly, Kelley Huntley and Jenny Latham met with Jody, myself and Scott Chambers in OEC to make this decision - and Jenny discussed it with Kevin.  There was nothing planned for major maintenance.  Please feel free to forward this on to Kevin so that he and Lavorato can resolve these issues.

Cc: Herndon, Rogers; Richter, Jeff Subject: FYI - Progress Report on testing an EES deal in Enpower   To all,  The following is documentation of a sample EES deal which was tested in the Enpower system.  This is for informational purposes only.  Please let me know if you have any questions, or need clarification on any points.    Over the last few weeks, a few of us have been working to test an EES deal in Enpower (St. Luke's - Roosevelt, part of the Beth Israel deal).  The deal is a fixed price sale in New York City (Zone J) of Energy, Line Losses, Ancillary's, and ICAP.  The T&D is a pass through.  We only tested one site out of the ten.  Needless to say, this is probably one of the simplest structures available.  Obviously, we have worked on a few other things at the same time, so it has taken longer than we expected, but I hope this will help highlight how difficult it is to book EES deals in Enpower in it's current state.  Quick statistics for ONE site:  Each month of hourly data, takes 5-6 minutes to save.  We booked 100 months (approx 8.3 years), therefore each deal type (energy, ancillary, etc.) took 8-9 hours to book. Since each deal type takes 8-9 hours to book, it takes a total of 25-26 hours to book energy, ancillary's (only 1), line losses, and ICAP (this is not booked hourly, therefore, it only takes 1 hour to book). Although we booked only one ancillary position, most markets have at least four, therefore the total booking time should be closer to 50 hours. Once we got a book to run, it took 25 minutes to calculate the value. All of the above statistics assume there are no errors in entering the deals.  Recommendations:  Work with Anthony Dayao to set up a system that can handle these trades for position management, valuation, reporting, scheduling, settlements, accounting, etc. In the interim:  Enhance RPS to make the valuation consistent with the batch valuation process.  This includes strengthening information for position and DPR reporting.  As well, create tools to help identify change in valuation due to curve shift, reg switch options, and new deals. Enhance Intramonth valuation and reporting (East desk does not currently have an intramonth book). Integrate the Tariff Valuation and Reporting.  Currently, this is done in a stand-alone spreadsheet application. Support the Curve Database project which will allow the breakdown of curves into its components (as opposed to current bundled curves). Move all the EPMI hedges to Enpower.  All hedges will become desk to desk instead of being entered in both RPS and Enpower.  Position and P&L reports will have be integrated between Enpower and RPS.     Here is a breakdown of what it took to 'rebook' this trade:  Week 1 (May 14-18)  Read Contract. Get Batch model, as well as a breakdown of value between Energy, Ancillary's, etc. Sit with Underwriting to answer questions about Load growth and contractual questions. Work on Wholesale Full Requirements model (in Excel) to check valuation.  Week 2 (May 21-25)  Continue working on Full Requirements model. Work with Risk Management (Stacey White's group) to set up delivery points and curves in Enpower.  Begin to book deal in Enpower - Getting access to Enpower took some time. Discovered that our assumption on hours for the 12x12 was incorrect.   We had gotten about 1/3 of the deal booked by the time we realized this. At times, the database tables would run out of space, because we have never entered a deal of this size in the test database.  This would keep us from entering any new data.  Week 3 (May 29-June 1)  Finished Excel Full Requirements model.  The EES Batch and the Wholesale model tie out except for some minor differences on discounting and ICAP.  The current ICAP curves are            $/MW-day, and they are not calculated using the correct numbers of days (i.e. June and July have the same MW/day price, even though there are 30 and 31 days, respectively, in each month).  This can be fixed in the curve files.  In the future we should mark the curves as $/Kw-month. Again, we ran into problems with the test database. Completed booking in Enpower.  Week 4 (June 4-5)  Took 2 days to get a MTM valuation (portcalc) to work. Discovered deal entry errors in booking.

"In addition, make sure we understand the steam obligation and it's effect on dispatch flexibity and heat rate.  It appears the 8000 Heat Rate is assuming above market steam sales are buying down the heat rate.   Solar turbines in combined cycle (without a steam sale credit) would usually have a heat rate around 10,000 Btu/kwh.  The lower heat rate is probably predicated on providing 24 hour steam, which means less dispatch flexibility and producing off-peak energy at a loss.

As you may recall, in response to EPMI's 1997 complaint against MAPP regarding the unauthorized assessment of third party compensation charges assessed on import and export transactions, FERC ordered MAPP (and its utility members) to pay refunds to customers.  EPMI's refund, including interest, was $750,000.  The utilities appealed FERC's order, arguing that FERC erred in ordering refunds.  EPMI filed a counter-appeal, arguing that FERC did not go far enough and the refunds should have been greater.  Our primary goal in filing the appeal was to counteract the utilities' argument and give the Court the other side of the story.    Although the Court did not grant EPMI's appeal, we're very pleased that the Court rejected the utilities' argument to revoke the refunds.   Now, unless the utilities appeal this to the Supreme Court (which is highly unlikely), EPMI's refund will no longer be subject to dispute.  Please let me know if you have any questions.

Subject: Perf Reports - Baseball Stats  Kevin, Below find your regions performance broken into  ""baseball stats"".  These numbers where generated off daily pnl's and would include reserves released, etc.  ? Transactional batting average is given the number of days (103), how many times did you show a profit on your daily pnl statement.  Keep in mind two things, a batting average of 300 is considered great in baseball. However, tossing a coin gives a 50/50.  Given that these numbers are daily pnl's and not trading strategies (strategies, you get to pick your pitch), I think the coin toss is the better measure.  With this in mind, anything above 50/50 reflects intellectual capital (research) at work.  If the average is significantly below 50/50, the suggestion would be to improve fundamental analysis. ? Dollar weighted batting average is the absolute dollars made divided by absolute dollars made and lost.  Differences between transactional batting average and dollar weighted batting average are attributed to trading discipline. ? Win/loss ratio is total dollars made vs. total dollars lost.  This ratio says that for every dollar bet, how much paid. ? Trading efficiency reflects the ratio average wins vs. average losses.  A ""pos"" shows that average wins exceed average loss.  The important note here is that the larger the win/loss ratio, the greater the trading efficiency, i.e. letting profits run while cutting losses early.  ""Neg"" efficiency implies that the trader holds onto his losses too long.  Does this add any insight into your portfolio?

For example in Illinois and Ohio, wouldn't these markets create free options if the wholesale price goes below reg gen?   -----Original Message----- From:  Herndon, Rogers   Sent: Monday, June 25, 2001 1:19 PM To: Black, Don Cc: Lewis, James; Presto, Kevin M.; Lavorato, John Subject: FW: Index Positions   Kevin -   we were in the process of extracting all of these options into a separate book for ease of identification and management.  This process was stalled so that we did not create unexpected errors surrounding our current CA efforts.  However, I spoke to Don and I think we are back on track.  Jay - can we pull together this info one way or another (prioritize our top 5 positions maybe).  Also, this does not create a free option.  To the extent the wholesale prices decline to the point where they equal the assumed underlying transition supply values then we should have no losses associated with erroneous dereg date assumptions.  However, if you step in and buy the wholesale power to ""mitigate"" this exposure and the wholesale curve continues to drop, you could be faced with new wholesale losses - especially if dereg is stalled and we have to purchase tarriff power at a pass-through and absorb our new wholesale hedge position loss.  Bottom line:  The loss associated with blown dereg assumptions decreases as wholesale prices drop to a point - we should be in good shape here as this will definitely minimize our clean-up costs associated with these errors.  We can probably best manage this exposure by purchasing wholesale call options as we observe the wholesale curve drop below the regulated tariff energy price.

Join us at the Distributed  Generation Conference and hear the latest information and overview of the  business and technical prospects for distributed generation. Our panel of expert  speakers will address the economics of distributed generation, evolving  regulatory policies, market projections, interconnection challenges, pricing  issues and much more. The Conference will also debate the role of distributed  generation (where and how), and identify the strengths and weaknesses of the  different generation technologies.

Electric Power  Market Performance Conference September 20-21, 2001, Denver,  Colorado   Overview  Each year there is additional opportunity to draw  lessons regarding electricity market structure and design from actual market  performance. These lessons are leading to a convergence in market design, at  least in the Eastern Interconnection and Ercot. One focus of this conference  will be on the lessons to be drawn from the experience of the new Ercot markets,  the continuing market design problems in California, and the difficulties in  developing and implementing a market based congestion management system in the  Midwest. A second focus of this conference will be on the  existing markets in PJM and New York, which have now moved beyond managing their  internal markets and are being pushed by market participants and regulatory  agencies to better address inter-RTO coordination and develop market based  incentive systems for transmission expansion. Finally, the conference will highlight one of the  important, but little noticed successes of the Eastern ISOs, which is the  explosive growth in the PJM and New York financial rights auctions.

Bob previously served as one of the business controllers for gas operations for Enron Americas, with direct responsibility for Gas Logistics and Volume Management.  The leadership team reporting to Bob will include Peggy Hedstrom (Calgary Operations), Jeff Gossett ( U.S. Gas Risk and South America Operations), Stacey White (U.S. Power Risk), Leslie Reeves (U.S. Gas and Power Confirmations and Settlements), and Bob Superty (U.S. Gas Logistics).   Brent Price will continue to lead Operations for Enron Global Markets and fulfill his dual role as Chief Accounting Officer for Enron Global Markets.   I am very pleased to announce that Kevin Sweeney will lead Operations for Enron Industrial Markets.  Kevin brings to his new role extensive risk and operations experience from stints in our Houston, London and Singapore offices.  Kevin fills the role that was previously held by Brenda Herod, who will now report directly to Beth Apollo.   Beth Apollo will be the Operations Project Manager for the assimilation of EES Wholesale. This will include Deal Capture, Risk Analysis,  Confirmations, and Global Data functions which have been moved into EWS under Global Risk Management Operations.  Successfully leveraging the infrastructure to support the EES business plan will also require close coordination with Gas Logistics, Settlements and the Operational Analysis (OA) process, and Beth will actively coordinate operations efforts with these teams and the commercial teams.  I have asked Beth to project manage the effort to look for opportunities to streamline and improve systems, processes and controls, and to consider alignment, where it makes sense, with existing EWS processes.  Reporting to Beth will be Scott Mills, with a focus on Deal Capture, Risk Analysis and Confirmations, and  Brenda Herod, with a focus on invoicing control guidelines and reporting requirements.   Beth will also continue to manage the Global Services function, which includes the consolidated DPR process and Global Operations Standards, led by Shona Wilson, and the Global Data function which is lead by James Scribner.  Mike Jordan will continue to lead operations for Enron Europe, working closely with me and other EWS operations leads to insure the proliferation of best operational practices worldwide for Enron.

Therefore the P&L has not been taking into account curve shift with the unerlying for these years.  We basically have a position marked against a zero price.  I am working with Ress and Jeff Jackson to resolve this issue.  Just wanted to keep you aware of the situation.  Since this is an off peak price out beyond the normal curves, I was going to have the curve generator pull the 2019 price and increase it based on the percentage increase in on peak prices for the respective years 2020-2022.  I will also calculate the P&L associated with this change to see when we want to recognize it.  Let me know what you have any comments and or suggestions.

In addition to walking out on eight plants (listed in yesterday's report and in today's article below), Local 15 also walked out on five peakers.  The walk out on the five peakers was again confirmed this morning through a union source, although we have yet to see any press information.  We are the following the developments and will keep you posted.  Please let us know if you have any questions or further tasking. Thursday June 28, 8:50 am Eastern Time  Press Release SOURCE: International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, AFL-CIO  Local 15, International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, Announces Strike Against Midwest Generation First Local 15 Strike in 50 Years, as Company Refuses to Negotiate in Good Faith NAPERVILLE, Ill., June 28 /PRNewswire/ -- Local 15, International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW), AFL-CIO, announced that its 1,150 members went on strike against Midwest Generation, EME, LLC, today at 6 a.m. The union's decision to strike comes after several months of unsuccessful negotiations with representatives of the California-based unit of Edison International Co.  Local 15 had proposed a collective bargaining agreement that would retain the ordinary and customary practices and the arbitration awards that have been in place for 13 years. The union also proposed maintaining the progressive discipline procedure that was contained in the previous contract. In response, Midwest Generation told union negotiators that it would reject the union's entire proposal, which includes the retention of existing procedures.  ``Because we have proposed no new language, it's unclear what Midwest Generation is trying to accomplish beyond a strike,'' said William H. Starr, President and Business Manager of Local 15, IBEW. ``We understand, given the fact that Midwest Generation is part of a financially troubled California power corporation, that there are concerns about Midwest Generation's ability to operate and maintain its Illinois operations. However, during the course of our negotiations, Midwest Generation representatives informed Local 15 that there was nothing in the union's proposal that would hurt the company's revenues or profitability in today's competitive marketplace.''  Local 15 is also troubled by Midwest Generation's misrepresentations of the union's position in this dispute. For example, Local 15 proposed no contract language to impede or limit the company's use of outside contractors. And it is Midwest Generation, not Local 15, that, after months of refusing to come to the bargaining table, has also refused to bargain in good faith.  Formal negotiations began one week after Midwest Generation was forced to sign a settlement agreement with the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), Region 13, on June 6. The settlement required the company to meet and bargain in good faith with Local 15 for a new contract. The previous contract had expired on March 31, 2001. On May 25, Local 15 announced its members had voted overwhelmingly to authorize a strike against Midwest Generation, with 89% voting in favor of the strike authorization.  ``By working without a contract since April 1, our members have demonstrated that they are absolutely dedicated to maintaining service for the Illinois communities that rely on power from Midwest Generation facilities,'' said Starr. ``However, because the company has refused to accept reasonable proposals offered by Local 15, we are forced to strike. It is unfortunate that Midwest Generation has so little regard for its employees, the livelihood of our members and their families and the people of Illinois. We are disappointed, but we will continue to fight for a new contract that is fair, reasonable and mutually beneficial.''  Local 15 members have established picket lines outside of each of Midwest Generation's seven fossil-generating stations in Northern Illinois. The plants supply approximately 40% of the electrical power capacity in the Chicago area. They are:  Crawford Station: 3501 S. Pulaski Road, Chicago.  Fisk Station: 1111 W. Cermak Road, Chicago.  Collins Station: N. side of Pine Bluff Road, 4 miles east of IL Rt. 47, Morris.  Joliet Station, #9: 1601 S. Patterson, Joliet.  Joliet Station, #29: 1800 Channahon Road, Joliet.  Powerton Station: 2 miles south of Pekin, off IL Rt. 29 on Manito  Road, Pekin.  Waukegan Station: 10 Greenwood Ave., Waukegan.  Will County Station: 529 E. Romeo Road, Romeoville.  In 1999, Midwest Generation acquired the plants from Commonwealth Edison Co. and entered into a purchase agreement that requires Midwest Generation to sell 80% of the power it generates at peak production to ComEd. ComEd, in turn, sells the power to about 3 million customers in the Chicago area. Several months after Midwest Generation acquired the plants, the company entered into a collective bargaining agreement with Local 15, IBEW, effective from December 15, 1999, until March 31, 2001.  Local 15, International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, AFL-CIO, represents 1,150 operations, production, maintenance and clerical workers at Midwest Generation's seven fossil-generating stations in Northern Illinois.

Cc: Presto, Kevin M. Subject: RE: Generation Pricing Support   Berney -   As we have mentioned in the past, York has no significant strategic value to the retail business.   The plant is located in PJM - West Hub, one of, if not the most, liquid, transparent and retail friendly supply location.  Bring us another deal with legitimate due diligence in PJM - East or Zone J/G and we could attribute some strategic value.  We have more than generously valued this generation and it does not interest me from a VAR allocation standpoint or otherwise..   Regarding our role in these generation efforts - I view them as minimal, but it is obvious they see differently.  I do not anticipate that our book will acquire generation but I am not sure if we need to staff up to handle this vs. distracting our regional structures with these efforts on an as requested basis.  One suggestion would be to have wholesale structuring price up these projects.  The drawback there is that we have most of the experts and Bernstein & Co. want to value ancillary adders etc.   Kevin, what are your thoughts?   RH    -----Original Message-----  From: Aucoin, Berney C.  Sent: Thu 6/28/2001 5:23 PM  To: Herndon, Rogers  Cc:  Subject: Generation Pricing Support    2 issues:   1) Bernstein has asked us to comment on the strategic value of their York proposition. Apparently, he has revisited the Fixed O&M assumptions with Virgo and the new numbers have him close to where our mid would be (approx. $22 million). Once again, we are representing our valuations based on limited information and NOT full pro-forma economics. I've suggested to Bernstein to talk to Don Miller's group for an exit strategy in case the buy this thing. (i.e., Alamac structure) Anyway, it leads to my next question.  2) If I'm asking this for the hundredth time, I apologize BUT: Do I need to staff up to accommodate ""generation-based"" pricing in our shop? Bernstein has asks me to facilitate getting access to structuring models to do their own notional pricing on deals. We need to address two possible scenarios:  They have access to structuring models but need access to curves in order to price their deals. In theory, they can use the precedent within EES that Orig/Product Development does their own notional pricing before going to Deal Mgmt./Structuring for Executable pricing.  They come to us for notional pricing. If this is the answer, I need to add to my staffing needs to accommodate this service.    Rogers, I'm indifferent as to which scenario is the ""right thing to do"" because I'm operating on the notion that we will not be managing the commodity risk associated with their deals. If this has changed, maybe both scenarios above are necessary to accommodate these value propositions.  I do realize the fact that our current retail systems can't accommodate spread options or even report the simple Greeks off of a straight forward Fixed Strike Euro, but we can handle this later if we are to warehouse this risk. I think you and I need to have clarity on this issue as we are getting more request to support that business.

Out of the 10 slots they rotate every 10 seconds, they can give us 7 slots.  This means that our ad will be on the site 70% of the time.  We can't take all 10 ads since they have to appear to be ""fair"" to other companies.  They are in a pilot phase and only doing this for 3 months for now.  This should be ok since they are willing to modify the  contract to reflect that we have first right of refusal if they extend the program.  We do risk any price increase after 3 months.  But, they are unwilling to offer a longer term than 3 months.    They have verbally reserved the space for us for today.  Please approve the following cost asap so that I can finalize the contract with them before someone else takes the slots:  3 months x $500/mo x 7 ads = $10,500 Ad development cost:  Don't know yet (I would guess about $5,000, we can discuss)  Thanks.

This design, while not perfect, is in the direction of PJM.  As such it provides a real time market (yes you will be able to go long/short 10,000MW in real time!), with no penalties and no balanced schedule requirement.  Although control areas will be maintained, SPP will be the central dispatcher (the role of the control areas as of 12/15/02 has yet to be determined).

Could either or all of you volunteer to call them and discuss the benefits of joining this effort?  The pitch should center around the broad reaching interface within both the EES and EWS organization, the exposure to the entire risk management process from cradle to grave, and eventually, good face time with many of the senior leaders within both organizations as they present their research findings.  This is a very hard group to recruit for, so anything you can do would be appreciated.  Send me a mail if you intend to help.     Suzette Emmons - She had some interest and is preparing to rotate but is leaning towards the SE Power Origination group in ENA because she is looking for modeling and commercial experience.  I think she would be a good fit (and also might want to go to Portland) and would like to figure out a way to get her.  She would be another good candidate for a phone call.  Chris Ahn - He had already committed to rotate through Power Structuring and was scheduled to begin following return from his honeymoon in a couple of weeks.  He is reasonably interested in our opportunity (and following that by going to Portland to work in Tim's group) but had concerns about walking away from his commitment to structuring.

It has been represented throughout their org that this is a ""new business opportunity""  Re: any further discussion of price curves we will use in these transactions, I am prepared to utilize Mid curves at best.  Reasons are as follows:  I bear the cost of wholsale hedge unwinds (at the bid) Resisdual Risk - These transactions do not completely absolve me of any and all risk Slippage/Curve Shift - Unless they do back-to-back deals I will incur some curve shift - essentially a hedge unwind cost or ""slippage"" Firm LD risk - curves reflect LD pricing vs. probable inferior products  In the event that we can take 100% of a porfolio risk segment off of our books, meaning sell a complete piece or area of our portfolio, I may be able to do better than Mid but will still have to recover the costs of wholesale hedge unwinds.  If anyone can bring me products that mitigate congestion and ancillaries, I will be glad to discuss pricing those components aggressively (again, factoring unwind costs).  The problem is that this function does not have the appropriate commercial supervision in its current spot.  I received some outside feedback that when this group met with Reliant that their commercial leads were less than impressed by our lack of understanding of the commercial realities of the power markets.  I witnessed this first hand at AEP when our supply rep asked AEP if they would be open to any tolling arrangements in their region just to have AEP respond, ""I guess you aren't aware that we don't really have any gas fired generation around here.""  It is unfortunate to have to sit back and watch this when we see opportunity (including the opportunity to confirm a potential value play by investigating with other suppliers). Ultimately this just costs the rest of the EES organization.       -----Original Message----- From:  Presto, Kevin M.

It will probably take until next week to get a decent cross-section from the financial/development segments, but you have put your fingers on the key. Who will start construction with 02 and 03 in the mid-$30's? Probably more than a few is my guess.  The July 2001 Edition of ""Smart"" Money had a section on energy. The cover read: ""Power Up Your Portfolio .. 10 Great Energy Stocks And Funds To Buy Now"". STOCKS 1. Apache 2. Dominion 3. Dynegy (your favorite) 4. Mirant 5. Noble Drilling 6. Quanta Services FUNDS 7. Strong American Utilities 8. Vanguard Utilities Income 9. Invesco Energy 10.Strong Energy  On one page, there was this message overlayed on top of two transmission towers: ""With fundamentals as strong as they are, there will never be a ""last time"" to buy these stocks.""  ""You've Got To Love Dynegy."" ""You can snap up the Houston-based Dynegy for just 21 times earnings - not bad for a leading energy marketer that's also one of the fastest-growing independent power producers in the U.S., with 17,775 megawatts operating in high-growth, high-demand regions such as the midwest, northeast, southeast, and California"". They were comparing Dynegy to Calpine (in terms of PEs) but were saying tha Dynegy had the trading too so they were a better bet (UGH)!  The wild card is dumb investors and lenders. Still too much money chasing too few quality cash generators.  I have given some further thought to the gas story, and I agree that the odds are low of any sort of meaningful bounce in price from today's levels. We are really quite certain that gas inventory will get mighty fat, and that the fronts will have to give way to create storage room for gas. This is the same ugly story I was putting forth when I saw you a few months back. While in theory coal could lose market to gas and heavy industry could restart (both being positive demand surprises), I agree that the odds of these are low ... but I will keep watching and testing notwithstanding. While are not expecting it this early, the combination of the above and a sharp contraction in gas oriented drilling could provide some support for prices. Again, for the time being it certainly looks like it is pleasant to be a bear. Give some thought to buying some of that mid-$30 energy for your end-users (2002/3) or don't they make deals that far out?  It is hard to see much upside risk to power without some odd weather wildcards or something funky on coal. Stock levels have remained low, but are building. We also have yet to see a really hot day this month. Before we bury this beast, I want to check its pulse one more time. Ontario set a new summer peak this past month. I gather the dash for gas stopped.  BEWARE OF HILLARY & SCHUMER: Spoke with FERC late on Tuesday. One more pop in NY and there may be a California style mitigation scheme put in place in New York according to my contact there.  I hope your 4th was enjoyable.

To facilitate your participation in Market  Trials, we are providing two types of informative, interactive orientation  sessions.  One covers the  Electronic Scheduling Process and the other provides an overall Market  Trials Orientation.  These  sessions are designed to provide an essential overview of the drills, scenarios  and reviews necessary for your people to actively participate in the Market  Trials. The Electronic Scheduling Process  session is available on three different dates in July and the overall Market  Trials Orientation session is offered on two different dates.  Because of the interactive nature of  these sessions the class size must be limited. Ideally, we would prefer no more  than two participants from each company. Please select the individual(s) from  your company who will attend these sessions, and forward the attached  registration brochure to them.   Please advise me if your needs exceed the requested attendance guideline  of two people per company. We will make every effort to accommodate your  request. We recognize that asking you to sustain a  steady commitment of time, resources and manpower is an exacting demand.  Your confidence that your Market Trials  participants gain as much knowledge about the Midwest ISO's operational  abilities is equally important to us.

For us to finish this work we need to have the front line customers in a room for a day or two and review your initial findings.  So far accenture has done all of the work with each of us in isolation and this has lead to us being further apart rather than leaving us with a common vision to start from.  I do not feel that accenture is ready for Kevin at this point however his number is 713-853-5035 if you want to call him after 3:00 but I believe he is out this Friday.  I'm available by cell at 713-806-6294 if you want to discuss.  For both tracks below Enron needs to create our team that will own and drive this work and this will take a little time as indicated in the meeting.  What we need is for accenture to finish the initial evaluation and work with us on the possible solutions and the effort required.  Once this is done an Enron team will be able to review the report and costs to complete our own evaluation.  The recommendations on what we do next will be coming from an Enron team. For these projects to be successful we need to have customer commitment or they will fail.

Please take a look and let me know if you have comments. I would like to    begin execution of the plan next Monday when Mani Vadari and Mike    Templin    are in Houston.     Essentially there are two tracks.     1. Near Term Program Development - The first track involves reviewing    the    initial recommendations developed over the past weeks with the business    and    also confirming the near term capabilities/projects which they believe    we    need to focus on. The main objective here is to make sure we are in    sync.    with the near term business needs and are able to link the projects very    specifically to those needs. I also want to make sure that the business    buys into the initial recommendations and is able to articulate the    benefits. If they don't we probably need to refine the recommendations.     2. Confirm Longer Term Program - The second track is to reconcile the    the    longer term plan developed by the team with the near term priorities    defined in Step 1, as well as break the longer term initiatives into    more    incremental components. I also wanted Mike Templin to investigate in    more    detail how the incremental EnPower Trading architecture migration would    work (per Madhup's healthy scepticism).     Lloyd, I wanted to make sure that Kevin is on board with this approach.    Is    it possible to set up a meeting tomorrow (Friday) with him to discuss    his    perspective?

Subject: New Albany Insurance Premium  Kevin,  We spoke some time ago about a proposal to buy down deductibles for our power assets and I recall receiving your authorization to proceed as respects the New Albany plant.  To recap, the deductibles under the Enron Corp property and business interruption policy were increased at the last renewal from $500,000 per occurrence to $5 million per occurrence effective March 1. We were shopping a number of options to buy this deductible down to $1 million for property damage and 30 day waiting period for business interruption.  This coverage was bound effective June 12 (the reason for the time lag is extreme volatility in the insurance market for power assets) at an allocation of $345,000 for New Albany.  I also checked with Stuart and he sees no transactional issues relative to the buydown. I understand that you have also purchased the dual trigger BI policy that effectively mitigates this initial 30 day waiting period exposure, so the BI coverage under the corporate program applies as a further risk mitigant for the catastrophic event.   Since it's been awhile since our last conversation, I did want to reconfirm the buydown option and premium charge with you.

Cc: Murphy, Melissa Ann; Sager, Elizabeth Subject: How to Handle ""Oops"" Trades on EnronOnline  Kevin:  From time to time, we are notified that one of our traders has mistakenly posted a trade on EnronOnline or that a counterparty hit a bid or offer on EnronOnline by mistake.  In the past, the traders were instructed that if such an ""oops"" trade occurred, they should enter into an offsetting trade with the counterparty.  Confirmations would then be sent out for each of the offsetting transactions.  Several counterparties have objected to receiving confirmations for such transactions, and from Enron's perspective, entering into offsetting transactions is less than optimal.  Accordingly, for all future oops trades, the traders should be instructed NOT to enter into an offsetting transaction.  Instead, I recommend that our traders take the following steps:  A.  If both traders agree that an oops trade has occurred,    1.  Agree to terminate the transaction and let the counterparty know that we will send a short written termination agreement.     2.  Notify Melissa Murphy at *31886 that the transaction has been terminated.  Melissa will make the appropriate entry in Enpower and will notify me so that I can prepare the termination letter.  B.  If the counterparty makes the mistake, we are not required to terminate the trade.  The counterparty agreed to be bound by the terms of its EnronOnline trades when it accepted the Electronic Trading Agreement.  It is up to our trader to decide whether to agree to terminate the trade.  Our trader can agree to terminate the trade only in exchange for some form of compensation, for example.  C.  If our trader made the mistake and the counterparty refuses to terminate the trade, give me a call so that we can discuss the options.  Please give me a call at your convenience to discuss.

David; Presto, Kevin M.; Davis, Mark Dana Cc: Staines, Dan Subject: NU CT-Long-Island Transmission Opportunity   Dan Staines and I met with NU's Transmission Business Unit yesterday to discuss their proposed transmission project connecting CT and Long Island.  In a nutshell, here are the details on the project (Dan can speak to greater technical details):  Run from Norwalk Harbor (CT) to Oyster Bay area of Long Island (Shore Rd substation)  Minimum capacity of 330 MW;  are considering approximate doubling of the capacity  Will be HVDC line, thereby facilitating flows in either direction and flexible scheduling  They have started siting process (formal filing to be made this fall) and have commitments from key vendors (production slots secured, etc.)  In order for the line to be workable, one of two things needs to happen:  (1) tansmission into the Southwest CT area needs to be beefed up; or (2) new generation needs to be placed at Norwalk Harbor.  As such, NU has proposed upgrades to the transmission system into Southweast CT (they are confident these upgrades can be accomplished without too much difficulty;  Dan believes it will be difficult)  They are planning on holding an ""open season"" for the transmission capacity (much as gas pipelines do), and are looking to get proposals by Aug 10, 2001.   In addition to basic fixed MW block purchase bids for a term of the bidder's preference (e.g., 100 MW for 5 years), they are interested in seeing alternative creative proposals.  The main objective of the open season is to secure sufficient transmission capacity sales contracts to get this project financed and built.   My hunch is that while they may get some healthy interest in capacity purchases, the bids will likely be shorter-term plays on the current congestion differential between CT and Long Island, and that they probably will not get a whole lot of long-term purchase bids to support raising project debt.  As such, I was thinking we might offer them a proposal something like the following:  Enron injects some level of debt or mezzanine funding to enable the project to lever up  In return, Enron receives either or both of: (1) series of options to acquire firm (physical or financial) capacity rights on the line for multiple periods of, say, 5 years each; or (2) option to acquire an equity position in the line  The options on the line could be made more valuable if we locked in optionality to develop new CCGT generation at or near Norwalk Harbor, thereby having the ability to deliver CC economics into the Long Island market  (I was speaking to CMEEC, and they indicate they have a site in the Norwalk area they want to develop)  What do you all think of this concept?

MISO has been attempting to figure out a way to do security analysis on transmission reservations, and felt that the Entergy Source/Sink policy was too restrictive, but the policy of not requiring source-to-sink at any point was too relaxed.  Their proposal was that ""at least one"" reservation on a tag/schedule must have the true source-to-sink; otherwise, the tag/schedule would be denied for improper use.  Representatives from CINergy, Duke, Dynegy, ACES, Ameren and LG&E worked with me to fight this concept, arguing that it was effectively identical to the Entergy Source/Sink policy in almost all cases.  After a meeting and two conference calls, in which the MISO ignored our comments and continually pressed for their option, we finally managed to convince them that it was unacceptable.    The new policy that MISO is planning to operate under is as follows:   1.) If, at the time a transaction is tagged/scheduled, the MISO reservation specified accurate source and sink, the tag/schedule will be approved.  2.) If, at the time a transaction is tagged/scheduled, the MISO reservation did NOT specify accurate source and sink, but analysis indicates the transaction can flow without compromising reliability, the tag/schedule will be approved  3.) If, at the time a transaction is tagged/scheduled, the MISO reservation did NOT specify accurate source and sink, and analysis indicates the transaction cannot flow without compromising reliability (i.e., the transaction will cause or contribute to a constraint), the tag/schedule will be denied  While this is not as unrestrictive as we might want, it allows us a great deal more flexibility that the Entergy Source/Sink barrier while at the same time allaying the MISO's reliability concerns.  Effectively, this allows us to redirect both firm and non-firm at the time of tagging/scheduling without a loss in transmission priority.  Not only will this give us more flexibility within MISO, but the MISO intends to sell it to the Alliance as well under the IRCA.    This also can give us a cornerstone in proving to the FERC that the Entergy S/S policy is not required for reliability, as other entities are able to meet reliability goals without the stifling limits Entergy claims are necessary.  As an aside, we are also pressing the MISO for a Redirection policy that will allow for ""partial"" redirects of service on a short term basis (the Separate proposal referenced in the attached document).  This will allow us to accomplish the same goals as the new MISO policy, but reduce the availability risk by allowing us to redirect prior to the time the transaction is tagged/scheduled.  These two proposals, when combined, will allow us for much more flexible uses of transmission without ignoring the reliability mantra providers chant whenever we ask for innovation and change.

For those who don't, he ran our structuring group in Portland from late 1997 until the middle of 1999.  He's an Army Grad, Wharton Grad, went through the Associate program and left Enron as a Director to join Entergy's Asset Development group working for Jeff Roberts.  He recently tendered his resignation at Entergy and is on the job market.  He is leaving Entergy on good terms -- he simply decided that he doesn't like working there for a variety of reasons.  Dale has a great background for many of the EES/EWS work that we are trying to do now.  He was an AWESOME structurer.  He ""gets"" trading.  He was responsible for the development and implementation of Entergy Power Marketing's risk systems.  In short, he would be a great catch for us.  I will be in Houston Monday and Tuesday of next week.  I will interview Dale on Tuesday.  I know that Louise and John are in PRC on Tuesday, so they would have to do it later.  Perhaps the rest of us could meet him on Tuesday.    I don't yet have a specific job nailed down for him.  I think that he could run a URM desk (east or west).  He could run the site profile, asset profile, dsm group.  I would expect that he would expect to come in at a VP level.  I know that's a high bar and hard to do here, which is why I would want this group of people to meet with him.  I have asked Debra Davidson to contact each of you to coordinate these interviews.

I believe we should have the right to sink just as the load control areas do.  This is an absolute must to level the playing field.  They have a huge advantage on any thing going to implementation.  We may need to go back to FERC or even the courts and,in my opinion we should not do any thing to weaken this stance.  If we get something better than ENTERGY take it but do not support it.  Let everyone know that we expect to be treated like any other player including the affiliates, Control Areas, and anyone else in the market place.  This is not the time to support a position that allows for discrimination.  You may want to discuss this in house.  But this is the position I think we should take on most issues as we go into the RTO era.  Sounds unbending but we must get a level playing field.

Cc: Dalton III, Oscar Subject: FW: RTO Development and impact to Commercial Transactions     Kevin,   These are excellent points. I spoke with Oscar about new long-dated commodity transactions requiring significant risk premiums due to regulatory uncertainty. In addition, we talked about the only way to become comfortable with contract language in long-dated transactions is to execute contracts containing language that ""shoves"" regulatory risk onto the customer. Both strategies will necessarily make longer term transactions less likely to be executed. I don't think Oscar is blaming the traders or legal for regulatory risks neither can control. The coverage and structured product mid-marketers have been focused on developing rapport with key customers, executing standard product deals and pitching term structures (synthetic capacity, services, etc.) as part of implementing the toatal market coverage standard.    With FERC's push toward ""super regional"" RTO's, our mid-marketers will need to be on top of proposed rules and mechanics of RTO formation. As you say below, with regulatory risk lies marketing opportunities. I will direct the marketers to be on top of these developments in order to identify opportunities.

I have already had several meetings with the desk heads and Elizabeth Sager on this very issue and work has begun.   This is a huge industry issue given the changing RTO landscape and its potential effects on the traditional ""into"" product.   Until there is clarity on the RTO market structure and transmission rights, there is simply not language that we can get comfortable with.  Rather than blame the traders and/or legal for transaction difficulty, why not immerse yourself into the MISO and Alliance documents and find potential opportunities.   Learn the difference between LMP and ""into"". What are the congestion areas in the Midwest.   What will the basis markets look like?   What is a basis market?What generation units will benefit from LMP/zonal pricing?   What generation will get hurt by congestion?    With regulatory change lies opportunity for marketing transactions.   The fact of the matter is a 2003-06 Into-Cinergy trade (long or short) contains significant regulatory risk, and to protect Enron's shareholders, we need to price addition premium or don't do the trade at all.   On the other hand, getting long at a plant bus-bar in a bullish LMP location and getting short LMP seller's choice would be a good trade.   These are the types of transactions the marketing group should be thinking about.   Take advantage of the changing regulatory landscape, don't use it as a crux.

"We would prefer physical rights that we can take day-ahead and/or real-time (5 minutes ahead, if possible).   Rather than an obligation (like FTR's), we prefer an option (spread on pricing that can only be positive when exercised).   I would want to condition the transaction on having one RTO in the NE with LMP pricing in effect for the entirie NE market on or before 1/1/2003.   Assuming we get over those hurdles, this would likely be viewed as a capital project internally (fixed cost structure), therefore, we need to earn a minimum of 25% expected return (after credit).   Obviously, there is a huge unknown on the CT vs. Long Island forward curve with the changing market conditions.   This makes pricing this deal extremely difficult, particulary with the returns we would need to show.

Subject: Discuss CT-Long Island Transmission play   Dana/Kevin   I would like to chat with both of you regarding what specific interests the desk would have in securing transmission rights between CT and Long Island.   As you may recall, NU is proposing to build this line on a merchant basis, and are seeking proposals on 8/17/01 (one week from this coming Friday).   My thinking is we may want to bid for some capacity on this line outright (how many MW? what term?), and potentially consider some more innovative structures such as:    Bring some debt or mezzanine funding to the table to help get the project financed, and get some options to take capacity on the line in return (what type of optionality -- desired term, preference for physical rights or financial settlements based on LMPs, etc -- would we find most valuable?)  Provide hedging products such as a CT-LI spread collar to enhance NU's ability to finance the project -- e.g., sell them a put option on the CT-LI bi-directional spread to insure some minimum cash flow on the line, in return for them selling us a call on the spread.  I am beginning to work with structuring to pull some values together, but I wanted to get your input on how to proceed.  Can we plan to speak sometime today/tomorrow?

A diagram of the system legs is on www.NeptuneRTS.com.  Some of the bidders in that open season will be gencos with little or no experience in trading, some will be load-serving entities, some will be power marketers.  There is likely to be interest in a Neptune hedge, and I wondered how we could engage Enron in an exploration of its willingness to provide such hedges. Essentially, bidders will be going long the various spreads (Nova Scotia - New York, New Brunswick - Boston, PSE&G - Zone J, etc etc) and we would like to encourage someone like Enron (I know there is no one quite like Enron but you know what I mean) to be willing to offer transmission hedges.  It may also interest you that FERC gave Neptune approval to hold 20 percent of the capacity for sale in the short-term markets. We (the development group) see that as a desirable exposure to these spreads for Neptune's equity investors and are in the equity markets now securing a second tranche of development capital, and will return in early 2002 for a sizeable amount of permanent equity assuming the bids received in September - October yield sufficient interest to finance the majority of the project in the debt market.  That's the plan, the primary virtue of which is that the authorities have allowed us to put it to a market test this fall. Let me know if you'd like to pursue this. I will make similar initiatives to several other entities later this week.  Ed    Edward N.

Vince   -----Original Message----- From:  ""Ed Krapels"" <ekrapels@esaibos.com>@ENRON [mailto:IMCEANOTES-+22Ed+20Krapels+22+20+3Cekrapels+40esaibos+2Ecom+3E+40ENRON@ENRON.com]  Sent: Tuesday, August 07, 2001 5:28 AM To: Vincent Kaminski \(E-mail\) Subject: Neptune  Dear Vince,  As you may know, FERC approved the Neptune transmission proposal on July 26 and the organizers (me among them) are now preparing to hold on open season starting September 10 to sell 80 percent of the capacity on a firm basis. A diagram of the system legs is on www.NeptuneRTS.com.  Some of the bidders in that open season will be gencos with little or no experience in trading, some will be load-serving entities, some will be power marketers.  There is likely to be interest in a Neptune hedge, and I wondered how we could engage Enron in an exploration of its willingness to provide such hedges. Essentially, bidders will be going long the various spreads (Nova Scotia - New York, New Brunswick - Boston, PSE&G - Zone J, etc etc) and we would like to encourage someone like Enron (I know there is no one quite like Enron but you know what I mean) to be willing to offer transmission hedges.  It may also interest you that FERC gave Neptune approval to hold 20 percent of the capacity for sale in the short-term markets. We (the development group) see that as a desirable exposure to these spreads for Neptune's equity investors and are in the equity markets now securing a second tranche of development capital, and will return in early 2002 for a sizeable amount of permanent equity assuming the bids received in September - October yield sufficient interest to finance the majority of the project in the debt market.  That's the plan, the primary virtue of which is that the authorities have allowed us to put it to a market test this fall. Let me know if you'd like to pursue this. I will make similar initiatives to several other entities later this week.  Ed    Edward N.

We are in the process of trying to bring some others to this.

Since the very beginning, Enron has given me the chance to demonstrate my talents and the chance to prove myself.  No other company would have given those chances at such a young age.  I like to think that I repaid the favor to at least some degree and am leaving Enron a little stronger than it would have otherwise been.

"Our marks are fine (at least through 04 where we occasionally see #'s).   I don't think it's appropriate to shut down anything.  We need to price the product properly and off-peak needs just as much margin as on-peak given the increase in coal prices and the effects of load growth.  Rather than shut down products, increase the price to reflect the current risk in the market.   We are chipping away at our off-peak position day by day and we have bought some NYMEX coal.  Am I making sense?   In addition, I am working with Doug to buy 7x24 from FPL in North Texas (for both desks).   We will probably have to pay $3.50-4.00 spread to get 3-5 year 7x24 deal done.

POst Article- Part Three   Traders, Old Utilities Tangle Over Wires  By Dan Morgan Washington Post Staff Writer Thursday, August 23, 2001; Page A01  Last of three articles ATLANTA Ever since steamboat captain W.P. Lay founded Alabama Power Co. in 1906 to develop electricity along the Coosa River, utility companies have been stringing wires throughout the South for one purpose: so southerners could have power and light. Now a bunch of outsiders, who buy and sell electricity but don't have a single retail customer below the Mason-Dixon line, have their sights set on those wires, and they are getting a helping hand from some powerful allies in Congress and the Bush administration. Aided by supercomputers, and operating out of trading rooms as big as hockey rinks, the new breed of traders buy blocks of electricity anywhere along the nation's power grid, then borrow transmission lines to ship it to the highest bidder. But to more effectively move power from where it is cheap to where it is in strong demand, they want to remove what they contend is a ""wire curtain"" around the South. That means forcing the southeastern utilities to relinquish control of the wires to a new, federally supervised regional authority. ""The monopoly is the wires, and that's where the battles occur,"" said Jeffrey K. Skilling, who was chief executive of Houston's Enron Corp., the largest of the power merchants, until he resigned last week. The clash grows out of a huge federal gamble on electricity deregulation. In 1992, with many utility behemoths staggering under debt from cost overruns on nuclear plants and the rapid spread of computer technology putting new demands on the grid, Congress opted for a competitive market. The plan was to dismantle long-standing utility monopolies and replace them with innovative electricity companies responsive to the laws of supply and demand. Now these new merchants of power, along with restructured utilities that have shed their old ways and embraced the new competitive world, have become strong advocates for a free-flowing, national electricity market. But in a classic Washington lobbying confrontation, they are running into resistance from traditional utilities, exemplified by Atlanta's Southern Co., now the parent of Alabama Power and other southern utilities. At issue is how fast the federal government, in the wake of the California electricity crisis, should push for yet more changes. Last month, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), recently stocked with President Bush's pro-market appointees, ordered most utilities to negotiate with federal mediators on procedures for handing over control of their wires to a few big regional authorities. Those authorities, in turn, will build new transmission lines, do away with bottlenecks, set uniform rates and ensure equal access to all. Next month, the Senate will take up proposals to give FERC even more authority to restructure the electricity industry. But what is good for Enron may not necessarily be good for utility customers in the South, according to executives at Southern Co., whose affiliates dominate power sales in Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi and north Florida. Southern Co., Chairman H. Allen Franklin said in a recent interview, ""will not go blindly"" into the system proposed by FERC. Although unfettered access to Southern's 26,650 miles of lines might help long-distance sellers of wholesale power such as Enron, company officials say it could mean congestion, power outages and higher prices for their 3.9 million retail customers. ""When California was restructured, it was thought there would be massive savings,"" Franklin said. ""Well, there haven't been."" Building the Power Trade If the California energy crisis left doubts about the future of a competitive market in electricity, a visit to Houston dispels them. In the city's energy alley, Enron Corp. -- with annual sales of more than $100 billion last year, double those of Texaco -- is finishing a new 40-floor office building adjacent to its 50-story tower. Enron's competitors, Dynegy Inc., Reliant Energy and El Paso Energy, are a few blocks away. Duke Energy North American, merchant arm of Charlotte-based Duke Power, has settled in as well. And Calpine Corp. plans to take over 12 floors of a new 32-story building near Enron. These power merchants are at the center of a burgeoning unregulated wholesale market, which now handles about a quarter of U.S. electricity output. But it is still a work in progress, fluid and accommodating in the Northeast and parts of the Midwest but much less open in the South. In exchange for utilities opening up their transmission lines to the new wholesale market, the 1992 Energy Policy Act law allowed them to buy or build unregulated power plants outside their service areas. Many did. Quickest to embrace competition were California and the Northeast, which had long endured high power costs. To spur competition, California and some northeastern states went further, requiring utilities to sell off their regulated plants and begin buying bulk power from wholesalers. Many states went further still, ending their utilities' long monopoly over retail sales and allowing customers to pick their own electricity provider. The Northeast already was something of a mecca for power traders because of its experiments with power pooling, in which groups of utilities merge their separate transmission systems and use a central manager to market and distribute their electricity. Enron, formed in 1985 by the merger of two big gas-pipeline companies, was quick to seize the opportunities. Its chairman, Kenneth Lay, a former official at the Federal Power Commission, FERC's precursor, during the Nixon administration, had pioneered natural gas trading during the volatile period of pipeline deregulation in the 1980s. As the electricity market began to develop in the early 1990s, Lay and Skilling, a weekend dirt biker with a degree from Harvard Business School, began applying some of the lessons learned in the natural gas markets. Enron signed its first long-term power contract in 1989, Skilling recalls. Independent companies that wanted to install gas-fired generators and sell the power on the grid could buy the gas from Enron under long-term contract -- then sell the electricity back to Enron. ""We started creating forward and futures markets"" using ""a lot more financial engineering"" than was required in other commodity businesses, Skilling said. By the late 1990s, Enron was buying the output of generating plants days, weeks, months and even years before it was produced, using sophisticated weather and economic data to predict a price at which it could be profitably sold. During the past five years, Enron has been one of the nation's fastest-growing companies. Its net income rose 40 percent in the second quarter of this year, although the price of a share has sunk to less than half of its 2000 high of $90, mainly because of setbacks in businesses unrelated to electricity. Investors pushed the price still lower after Skilling's departure last week. Southern Inhospitality Like other merchants, Enron plunged into California after the legislature opened up that giant state to electricity competition. But the Southeast remained less-friendly territory. Texas is the only southern state to adopt retail deregulation. Florida goes so far as to ban out-of-state companies from building almost any plant for the wholesale market. The region is the domain of huge traditional utilities that control the wires from Louisiana to Florida and up into Appalachia and the Carolinas. The web of power lines, tied to the utilities' coal-, nuclear- and gas-fired generating plants, reaches across states via 500-kilovolt workhorses and down into neighborhoods served via single wires strung on wooden poles. For Southern Co., its reputation as a traditional utility heavy is a badge of pride. In 1997, it displayed a picture of a gorilla on its annual report. Clustered around its borders are Entergy, another huge holding company that serves Louisiana, Arkansas, and parts of Mississippi and Texas; Florida Power & Light; Carolina Power & Light; Duke Power; and the federal government's centralized power giant, the Tennessee Valley Authority. Those utilities have been under little pressure from customers to share the lines with wholesale competitors in the interest of lower prices. Prices run 15 percent or more below the national average, thanks to a rich lode of coal and natural gas and general public acceptance of the high-tension lines that carry the power generated by those fuels. FERC, in a series of orders from 1996 to 2000, required utilities to open their wires for power shipments by independent merchants and to post how much transmission capacity they have available at any given time. The message, a former official said, was ""they couldn't use the wires to preclude others from getting their juice to market."" But merchants say it is difficult to ascertain the accuracy of the postings made by the southeastern utilities because they operate the transmission lines as part of their closed, plant-to-customer systems. A November 2000 FERC staff investigation of bulk power markets in the Southeast concluded that the transmission monopoly enjoyed by the region's utilities has discouraged independent power producers from siting new plants in the region. FERC investigators cited Southern Co.'s refusal to let SkyGen Energy Inc. connect to its transmission lines in Alabama. Southern said the added load ""would cause an area-wide stability problem for electric supply."" In that case, FERC denied SkyGen's request for relief. Enron Vice President Kevin Presto said that day-ahead sales to customers such as municipal utilities in Southern's territory have become possible. But he said Enron has trouble getting long-term transmission commitments from Southern that would enable it to sell such power regularly. Also, he said, Enron cannot easily move power long distances through Southern's grid. ""If I tried to buy transmission across Southern Co. to Jacksonville Electric, there'd be zero available,"" Presto said. Of the overall situation in the Southeast, he said that the utilities ""give you 0 to 5 percent of their transmission capability because they preserve the rest of it for native load [retail customers]. So you have a huge highway that's supposed to promote the free sale of electrons that isn't available to the wholesalers."" Southern Co. Chairman Franklin dismissed as ""unfounded"" the complaints of the merchants, and officials representing Alabama and Georgia municipal utilities tied to Southern Co.'s lines say they generally have been treated well. Robert Johnston, president of the Municipal Electric Authority of Georgia (MEAG), which supplies power to 48 towns, took issue with the notion of a wire curtain. ""The market is growing in Georgia,"" he said. MEAG has its own trading room and has done business with a hundred or so traders or independent power producers. It also has its own generators producing power at four sites, though Southern Co. has an interest in all of them. ""There's not a grass-roots interest"" driving the reforms, Franklin said. ""It's the wholesale players."" While it squares off against the newcomers in the Southeast, though, Southern itself has aggressively exploited the growing wholesale market. Until it was spun off as a separate company earlier this year, Mirant Corp., Southern Co.'s marketing subsidiary, competed in California, the Midwest and the North, supplementing leaner profits from Southern Co.'s regulated units. ""Southern's strategy has been clear: Compete elsewhere and run a monopoly at home,"" said Allen Mosher, director of policy analysis at the American Public Power Association. Well Connected for Battle The next move is up to the federal government. Next month, Sen. Jeff Bingaman (D-N.M.), chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, plans to propose legislation giving FERC expanded powers over wholesale transactions and transmission, so that ""vested interests"" will not be able to ""manipulate the use of the transmission system"" to benefit their own plants, Bingaman's office said. In the House, key players will be Commerce Committee Chairman W.J. ""Billy"" Tauzin (R-La.), whose state is home to Southern Co.'s western neighbor, Entergy, and Rep. Joe Barton (R-Tex.), chairman of the energy and environment subcommittee, who has had close ties to the huge coal-dependent Texas utility TXU. Last week, Entergy hired former FERC chairman Curt L. Hebert Jr., a Mississippi prot?g? of Senate Minority Leader Trent Lott (R-Miss.), to handle regulatory and government affairs. Enron recently hired a former aide to House Majority Leader Richard K. Armey (R-Tex.), as well as a former senior spokesman in the Bush campaign, Edward Gillespie of Quinn Gillespie & Associates. Enron officials are counting on support from House Majority Whip Tom DeLay (R-Tex.), the hometown Houston congressman, though it is uncertain how much influence DeLay, an enthusiast for electricity deregulation, can bring to bear. Industry lobbyists who gathered on Capitol Hill in July for closed-door meetings that DeLay sponsored, but did not attend, could not reach consensus on electricity. As a result, the energy bill passed by the House on Aug. 2 skirted key issues involving greater accessibility to the grid and electricity reliability. Bush's election, and the fact that many utilities have plunged enthusiastically into the competitive market, clearly has created a more favorable political climate for the power merchants. Bush's first two appointees to FERC, Pat Wood III and Nora Mead Brownell, moved quickly to fix what they viewed as the Washington electricity bottleneck. Wood had worked with Enron during a six-year effort to create a more competitive energy market in Texas, where Wood headed the state's public utility commission. Brownell, a former Pennsylvania utility regulator, won praise from Enron in 1997 when she helped block a restructuring plan that Enron contended would keep it out of the Philadelphia market. On July 11, with a majority in tow, Wood, Brownell and William L. Massey, a Clinton appointee who is an ardent supporter of competition, tossed out proposals by Southern Co. and other utilities and directed utilities throughout the country to commence negotiations with federal mediators on handing over control of their lines to four independent regional transmission organizations, or RTOs. ""It was about time [a bomb] was dropped,"" Wood said. But FERC's action may only have been what power association's Mosher calls the ""beginning of a long movie."" Among those opposing expanded FERC authority are environmentalists who are fearful that new federal powers could lead to an expansion of high-voltage power lines; western property-rights advocates; and state utility regulators. Politically well-connected groups not now regulated by FERC -- including the TVA, rural electric co-ops and municipal power systems -- are also wary of new federal powers. ""There are big questions about FERC's role, who will determine transmission-line charges, should there be federal [authority] to site power lines, should there be FERC jurisdiction over power generation and reliability,"" said Rep. Richard Burr (R-N.C.), vice chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee. Idaho utility regulator Marsha Smith, who heads the electricity committee for the National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners, noted that her state's three investor-owned utilities cannot transfer ownership or control of their transmission lines ""without our approval."" Such approval does not seem likely anytime soon. Smith noted that 60 percent of the state's power comes from hydroelectric dams. ""That's public property,"" she said. In Alabama, James Sullivan, a state utility regulator overseeing Southern Co.'s affiliate, said he was not happy about the way FERC was proceeding. ""I'm opposed to any [changes to] our electric system in Alabama until I know it's going to bring rates down and enhance reliability for us,"" he said. In the view of Southern Co. Chairman Franklin, it is still an ""open question"" whether FERC has the legal authority to force utilities to surrender control of all their wires. Nonetheless, the restructuring of the power markets may already have gone too far to ""put the genie back in the bottle,"" according to a former FERC official. The power merchants readily concur. ""Everybody's paying too much because you've got this huge conservatism built into this bureaucratic operation of the utilities,"" Enron's Presto said.

Subject: McQueeney Property  Kevin -  Definitely get in touch with Mickey Ferrell (Ferrille?) Realtors - The McQueeney office (not the Seguin office).  The phone number is 830-557-5824.  Ask to work with Jackie specifically.  Jackie knows Elizabeth's family, The Otts, and me.  I am better friends with her husband - he drives boats and teaches kids how to ski for the Ski Lodge.  You will find a wide variety of homes on McQueeney.  The balance will be between location, lot size and how nice you may want the existing structure to be.  As for location, the prime areas will be:  1) Near the Lake Breeze Ski Lodge (near the Ott's house)  2) Water front on and around ""the Island""  (just as nice maybe nicer- more to choose from) 3) Waterfront ""Up-River""  - Generally larger lots, less consistency in quality of homes  Expect values from $150 - $250k for a lot only.  houses will run from $350k - your limit.  Last time we were on the lake I noticed several new For Sale signs as you would expect.  The more I think about it, this lake is ideal for where you live.  It takes me 2:20 ish from my house and should take you no more than 2 hours from where you live today.  Let me know how things are going and if you are ever planning to head up there I will check my schedule and show you around if possible.  One thing to consider is going up on a Saturday morning and getting a room at The Lake Breeze Ski Lodge.  Drive around with Jackie during the am/afternoon and get Sambo (Jackie's husband) to take you and the family out on the boat for an hour or so (Sambo has a couple of Ski Nautiques).  The lodge has a great pool, bar, dining, and playground.  It is open weekends only through mid October I believe.  Open full time while school is out.  Rooms are about $65 and they are what you would expect.  A nice family/social place on the lake.  Of course, if we are there, we would be happy to take everyone out on the boats and such, but if we aren't everything is accessible through the lodge.

Williams Signs $10 Million Weather and Climate Research Alliance with the University of Oklahoma August 27, 2001 09:02:00 AM ET Increased Accuracy of Weather Prediction Technology  Provides Significant Economic Advantages for Energy Industry Leader  TULSA, Okla., Aug. 27 /PRNewswire/ -- A unit of Williams WMB </inc/news/quoteredir.asp?symbol=us:WMB> today announced a $10 million strategic alliance with the University of Oklahoma (OU) to enhance weather and climate research, technology development, and undergraduate and graduate meteorology education.  This commercial arrangement, the largest of its kind in the U.S. between a private corporation and a university meteorology program, is a mutually beneficial agreement that allows OU to expand its top-tier meteorology programs while Williams receives exclusive weather analysis and forecasting tools. This will give Williams a globally competitive advantage in energy marketing and trading, while related educational and research activities are expected to produce for Williams the nation's most qualified meteorologists and weather impact decision makers.  ""This is a partnership between business and higher education where both parties benefit,"" Keith E. Bailey, Williams chairman, president and CEO, said. ""This alliance provides Williams access to weather research and technology that is dramatically superior than traditional government weather services and customized to Williams' unique needs. With weather being the number one driver of volatility in gas and power markets, we expect to see a significant return on our investment.""  ""This history making agreement between Williams and the University of Oklahoma's School of Meteorology, a national leader in its field, is a dramatic demonstration of the power of a private sector-university partnership in the creation of economic productivity and growth, and the expansion of knowledge,"" said OU President David L. Boren. ""I predict that this alliance will become a national model for joining together American international leadership in higher education with private sector creativity and vitality. We are deeply grateful for the confidence placed in this outstanding program at the University by Williams.""  Highlights of this expansive agreement include:      * Unique, advanced weather and climate prediction capabilities tailored by       the University of Oklahoma's Weather Programs specifically for Williams'       weather-sensitive businesses.     * A grant of $8.1 million over five years to fund research in advanced       weather analysis and prediction at the Center for Analysis and       Prediction of Storms (CAPS).  This includes funding for a supercomputer       that will be most powerful among all Big-12 institutions.     * A grant of $1.6 million over five years to fund regional climate       research at the Cooperative Institute for Mesoscale Meteorological       Studies.  This money will bring to OU the most advanced climate system       model in the world, and will fund research scientists as well as       graduate and undergraduate students.     * Gifts to create the Williams Endowed Chair, an advanced student computer       laboratory, funding for three Williams Fellows in the Master of Science       in Professional Meteorology Degree in the School of Meteorology and a       gift to the Oklahoma Climatological Survey. ""We believe the outcome of this partnership will yield a world class suite of weather forecast and analysis products suited for use in the energy marketing and trading industry,"" says Denise Russell, director of Market Analysis at Williams' energy marketing and trading unit, who, in 1998 began to hire OU meteorology graduates. ""We also will have a valuable pipeline for new technological and human resource capabilities with which to maintain these developments.""  According to Dr. John Snow, dean of the OU College of Geosciences and director of Oklahoma Weather Center programs, the School of Meteorology, has already begun to aggressively recruit some of the nation's top graduate students as part of the new partnership, and will expand this effort in the next several months now that the contracts are signed.  ""Through this alliance with Williams, The University of Oklahoma has obtained the resources necessary to continue generating new knowledge, defining the global standard for weather technology and developing outstanding graduates, all while bringing new jobs and opportunities to Oklahoma in weather-related fields,"" says Snow.  The Williams/OU alliance was made possible through technology advances in computing resources and the enactment of Oklahoma State Questions 680 and 681, which provide for the establishment of commercial entities that are licensed for the exclusive right to commercialize the technology developed within research and development sections of universities.

Subject: McQueeney Property  Kevin -  Definitely get in touch with Mickey Ferrell (Ferrille?) Realtors - The McQueeney office (not the Seguin office).  The phone number is 830-557-5824.  Ask to work with Jackie specifically.  Jackie knows Elizabeth's family, The Otts, and me.  I am better friends with her husband - he drives boats and teaches kids how to ski for the Ski Lodge.  You will find a wide variety of homes on McQueeney.  The balance will be between location, lot size and how nice you may want the existing structure to be.  As for location, the prime areas will be:  1) Near the Lake Breeze Ski Lodge (near the Ott's house)  2) Water front on and around ""the Island""  (just as nice maybe nicer- more to choose from) 3) Waterfront ""Up-River""  - Generally larger lots, less consistency in quality of homes  Expect values from $150 - $250k for a lot only.  houses will run from $350k - your limit.  Last time we were on the lake I noticed several new For Sale signs as you would expect.  The more I think about it, this lake is ideal for where you live.  It takes me 2:20 ish from my house and should take you no more than 2 hours from where you live today.  Let me know how things are going and if you are ever planning to head up there I will check my schedule and show you around if possible.  One thing to consider is going up on a Saturday morning and getting a room at The Lake Breeze Ski Lodge.  Drive around with Jackie during the am/afternoon and get Sambo (Jackie's husband) to take you and the family out on the boat for an hour or so (Sambo has a couple of Ski Nautiques).  The lodge has a great pool, bar, dining, and playground.  It is open weekends only through mid October I believe.  Open full time while school is out.  Rooms are about $65 and they are what you would expect.  A nice family/social place on the lake.  Of course, if we are there, we would be happy to take everyone out on the boats and such, but if we aren't everything is accessible through the lodge.

"Sounds like you are as busy as I am.   Yes, my parents still live in the same house in Kennewick.   My Dad retired from teaching in WA (collecting WA retirement) and has been teaching in Hermiston, OR for the last 7 years.  Just to clarify, Enron's international business model and North American business model are quite different.   I work in the Enron North American business unit which has been extremely profitable and has pioneered the deregulation of the natural gas and electricity markets in the US.   Enron NA's focus has been on creating efficient wholesale markets in gas, power, crude, pulp & paper, metals, etc and then providing the market with a logistical delivery and price risk management intermediation function.   We are very cost effective in this function because we achieve huge scale and scope in the market with minimal fixed costs.  Enron's international business model, on the other hand, entailed constructing capital intensive infrastructure power and gas projects with leveraged project financing (with project financing supported by long term sales to government utilities).   This model is OK provided the business risk, currency risk, international risk, change in law risk, legal risk, etc. is priced properly by the debt and equity providers.  I will let you conclude which business model is better.   I think you will see Enron applying our successful NA model into the international markets that have an economy and regulatory environment that supports a ""free-market"" model.  Later.   -----Original Message----- From:  ""Christine Engstrom"" <christine_engstrom@fanniemae.com>@ENRON [mailto:IMCEANOTES-+22Christine+20Engstrom+22+20+3Cchristine+5Fengstrom+40fanniemae+2Ecom+3E+40ENRON@ENRON.com]  Sent: Friday, August 31, 2001 2:01 PM To: Presto, Kevin M. Subject: Re: BLS Alum?   I'm really surprised that this email found you -- it was a shot in the dark.  Glad to hear that you are doing well.   You have a better memory than mine, but I believe that you are right.  The last time that I did see you was at the wedding.  That was a long time ago.  I have not stayed in touch with anyone from that area.  Although, my parents still live outside of Pasco.  I haven't been to the Tri-Cities in years, though, since my family usually meets in Seattle where my sisters live.  Do your parents still live in the Tri-Cities?  How do you like Houston?  I almost moved there a couple of years ago to take a job with Unocal.  Since the last time I saw you, I went to the U.W. for undergrad and then headed East to go to grad school at the University of Virginia where I did a M.A. in international affairs and econ.  I gravitated to the D.C. area for international work where I have remained since then.  I worked for the International Finance Corporation with the World Bank for about five years covering investments in South Asia.   The travel to India was fun, but a little crazy at times.  I would inevitably get sick when I went there.  The early 90s was an interesting time to be in India, as the country was just starting to privatize.  If you were in Bombay's financial district, you would still see piles of notes being wheeled around in rickshaws to the stock exchange.  I eventually left the IFC (Wall Street hours w/o the pay) and moved to the Overseas Private Investment Corporation, where I spent about five years doing partial risk guarantees for Turkey and that region.  I encountered Enron's project finance team in Houston and your D.C. rep., John Hardy.  Enron has a plant in Turkey for which OPIC guaranteed and provided financing.  Enron was/is one of OPIC's largest clients, receiving support for Dabhol, etc.  However, I know that Enron is now pulling back from these types of ventures, which is where your work is focussed, I gather.  It must be an interesting job, I would like to hear more about it.  I haven't really followed Enron's move into the power trading sector.  I just changed jobs about a month ago and now work at Fannie Mae (still in D.C.) buying and pricing mortgage-backed securitizations.  I cover the West Coast and Dallas area.   It is a big switch from IFC and OPIC b/c it is all domestic, so my boondoggles to Turkey, etc. have been cut off.  So far, I like the company.  I had worked on providing wraps on bonds to mitigate some sovereign risks for emerging market issuers while at OPIC.  I spent a fair amount of time with capital market investors and investment banks, so I made the move to Fannie Mae to concentrate specifically on the secondary market.  I'll probably roll this experience into international structured transactions in a year or two.  I'm also doing my MBA at Georgetown right now.  It should be a busy year...CAE   Kevin.M.Presto@enron.com wrote:  > You have the right Kevin Presto.   I have been employed at Enron now for > almost 7 years.

Jeff, Don - any others.  I am not sure I agree with Starwood.  If we are going to write down the option (currently at $6MM) to $2.5 MM then I will take it in my book at greater value based on what you described.

Some of the outstanding issues could reduce this negative somewhat.  We should have a better feel by Thurs.  Overall, I want to reflect fair value on the re-books, not extreme conservatism.  For example, on TYCO, I will not use NY Zone A for revenue purposes if the contract is unclear and does not force us to do this.

PJM's proposal is attached.  As you may recall, I gave you a copy of PJM's proposal and we discussed it when I was in Houston a couple of weeks ago.  The main concern with PJM's proposal is its timing -- their time line provides for an implementation date of November 2003.  We have talked extensively with PJM about the need to speed up the implementation process, and PJM agrees that they will move aggressively, but they are unwilling to change their target date in their proposal.  Because we disagree with the PJM date, we propose to have Enron Power Marketing, Inc.'s name included on the list of supporters of the proposal, with the following footnote:   While all of the members of the One RTO Coalition support the substance of PJM's proposal to implement a single energy market as described herein, Enron  Power Marketing, Inc. dissents from PJM's date of November 2003 for implementing the single RTO in the Northeast.  Enron believes that the PJM proposal  can and must be implemented by December 2002 and that extension of the implementation date past December 2002 is unnecessary and contrary to the  Commission's RTO policy established in Order No. 2000.  This footnote will preserve our right to argue against PJM's timing in comments to the Commission after the Judge submits his report (due on September 17).  In those comments we can go into much greater detail about the need for quick implementation.  Please let me know if you have any suggested changes to the footnote or if you disagree with our proposed strategy.  We will address this issue on Thursday at mediation (I thought it was going to come up today, which is why I called each of you), so if you have any comments or concerns, please let me know as soon as possible.

A brochure describing the course content and instructors is attached as a PDF file at the bottom of this message. Brian Stanley agreed this looked like an informative event, so we committed a slot for Enron among the approximately 25 participants. We'd like you to suggest who would be the best person to represent Enron in this session.  These courses are interactive and are geared to executives. (Per course brochure, audience is CFO, Sr. VP Generation, VP Asset Mgmt, VP Power Supply, VP Development, Director Market Analysis/Valuation.) Companies represented for this one include Ameren, Cinergy, Duke, Exelon, etc.  The course is being held Oct 1-2, 2001 in the Crowne Plaza, just down the street from our office. The cost would be about $3,600.00. EEOS has paid the fee to hold a place.  The course seems focused on making complex decisions about assets in light of uncertainty and volatility, which might be of some value in assisting ENA with strategy about potential acquisitions. Also, we would get some exposure to what other players in the market are thinking. One speaker is the Sr. VP of Asset Management for Duke Energy North America.  Some suggested criteria for the candidate to attend:  1.   Involved in decisions about valuing Generation Assets based on uncertain future outcomes as opposed to simple discounted cash flow analysis.  2.

Sent: Thursday, September 06, 2001 2:06 PM To: Steffes, James D.; Novosel, Sarah; Presto, Kevin M.; Shapiro, Richard Subject: Enron v. FERC appeal at DC federal court (Entergy source and sink)   The mediator in our appeal of the Entergy source and sink suggested that Enron may want to try and settle this.  I asked B&P for the costs to get through oral argument, which are only $4000.  During the course of our SE RTO mediation, the Entergy person working on congestion management agreed with me that implementation of the LMP/financial rights model in the SE would alleviate the need for the Entergy Attachment M and Southern's similar attachment.  However, that model (should we get it) won't be in effect until sometime next year (at the earliest).  Also, Enron has sold its control areas. (VEPCO, our co-appellant, still has Batesville in Entergy).  It seems that it would make sense for us to approach FERC staff working on this matter, get their thoughts, and then perhaps approach Entergy.  FERC is the one that would actually settle, not Entergy (also, FERC must change the policy -- getting Entergy to simply withdraw Att. M is certainly good for precedent, but Southern can still keep its Att. unless FERC makes Southern change its tariff).  If nothing else, having another FERC avenue to voice our support for the LMP financial rights model (no day ahead balanced schedules), which alleviates this discriminatory practice like Entergy Att. M, would be helpful.  What are your thoughts?   -----Original Message----- From: Jacqueline Java [mailto:jjava@bracepatt.com] Sent: Tuesday, September 04, 2001 6:37 PM To: Nicolay, Christi L.

Our sales are virtually all commencing 1/1/02.  A delay will result in foregone margin and possible incremental losses until such time we can physically serve.  For example, we will possibly be forced to serve our customers with regulated utility gen service until such time as ERCOT can fully implement direct access.  The cost are greater than our retail gen product and greater than our sales price = loss of margin + incremental losses due to costs above sales price.  (make sense?)  I have expressed this concern to EES Origination.  Margins are extremely tight in ERCOT, approximately $2.00 Mwh above offer and if we build in a fee/reserve to account for this risk we will probably shut down the TX effort.  Our competitors (absent Shell) are apparently not considering/pricing this risk.  In fact, the incumbent utilities have a natural hedge.  If open access is delayed then their customers just continue to pay higher tariff rates, thus they are incented not to assist in a speedy transition.  I suggested that at a minimum we reserve margin until we have a better feel for transition status but obviously received no nods of approval.  I will get with Steffes on Monday to get a feel from him, and Doug if you could provide your thoughts as well.  I am afraid we may have no choice other than imposing some price component to reflect this risk which could lead to our being viewed uncompetitive in the marketplace.

"Todd and Louise, =20 With respect to No. 1 below, I will check with Mike Curry to get his view o= n ""contract intent"". =20 With respect to No. 2 and No. 3, the answer is absolutely ""NO"" as they are = material changes to the contract that have significant value issues.   Sinc= e I personally requested these changes to the original contract (in the neg= otiation process), I know what the contract intent was and continues to be. =20 If AEP is still the equity buyer, they have complete control over the ""grid=  curtailment"" and associated termination risk in item No. 2 since they are = the transmission owning utility in the region. =20 The total EPMI PPA (as of 9/17 COB) value is currently $18.5 million.  My e= stimate for PPA value erosion for amendments No. 2 and No. 3 is $8-10 milli= on.   Obviously, the $ erosion value is somewhat subjective, however, the t= ransmission risk/grid curtailment risk on this project is significant and t= he termination event for grid curtailment is essential to mitigate what cou= ld be substantial downside for EPMI.   The reason I had Mike ensure this pr= ovision was in the current PPA was to shift some of that risk back to Enron=  Wind and now Enron Wind is trying to push it to the project lenders (who a= lso don't want the risk). =20 =20  -----Original Message-----=20 From: Lindholm, Tod A.=20 Sent: Mon 9/17/2001 5:54 PM=20 To: Presto, Kevin M.; Curry, Mike; Lamb, John; Payne, Michael=20 Cc: Murphy, Harlan; Kitchen, Louise=20 Subject: RE: Amendment to IM II PPA    =20   Kevin,  =20  EWC requires three clarifications to the PPA in order to get the project fi= nanced and sold.  All previously requested amendments proposed by the equit= y purchaser have been dropped, and EWC will take the resulting pricing redu= ction. =20  I want to make sure you understand how minor these three clarifications are= .   These clarifications conform to the original deal and are NOT changes t= o the deal. =20   1.  Banking Provisions.   EWC and EPMI agreed that energy and renewable en= ergy credits (""RECS"") produced by the Indian Mesa II wind generating facili= ty in any year in excess of the annual minimum quantity would, on a cumulat= ive basis, offset any deficiencies of energy and RECS in subsequent years. = Section 4.04 of the agreement does not clearly provide the cumulative carry= over mechanism which was contemplated by the parties. (This section origina= lly provided for the carryover, but in an effort to simplify the language, = the aggregate carryover concept was clouded.)  Both the project lenders and=  the proposed equity purchaser have required that the point be clarified.  = There has never been a disagreement between EPMI and EWC on the intention o= f the carryover banking provisions. EPMI's most recent refusal to make this=  clarification now appears to be a change in the original deal   2.  Grid Curtailment EWC and EPMI  drafted the contract  with specific pro= visions relating to  termination resulting from grid curtailment, Section 5= .04  .  There is an ambiguity in that grid curtailment could also be covere= d  under the termination provision relating  to force majeure under Section=  5.02.  This  inconsistency is the problem.  Neither EWC nor EPMI were to p= ay damages to the other party in the event of grid curtailment.  The propos= ed equity purchasers have requested that the force majeure provisions of  t= he PPA  be clarified to make it clear that extended grid curtailment would = not give rise to termination payments.  This clarification is consistent wi= th the original intent of the parties and is not a change to the deal.   3.  EPMI Credit Support.  EPMI's obligations under the PPA are guaranteed = by Enron.  The Indian Mesa II PPA permits EPMI to assign the PPA to certain=  affiliates without consent of the seller.   Any assignment by EPMI would n= ot relieve it of its duties and obligations under the contract, and the Enr= on guarantee would remain in place.  However, the project lenders have requ= ired clarification that the Enron guarantee would either explicitly remain = in place or that the assignee would have a credit quality at least as good = as Enron Corp's credit quality.  The project lender's have also requested t= hat the termination payment provisions be clarified to provide that any sub= stitute PPA used to calculate a termination payment would also need to be w= ith a party that had a credit quality similar to Enron Corp's, since that i= s the credit that is supporting the Indian Mesa II PPA.  This will not affe= ct the value of the contract to a third party since Enron bears this obliga= tion unless released by the project.  Under the dispute resolution provisions of the PPA we could certainly pursu= e declaratory relief under arbitration.  Our sense is that this does nothin= g but ensure delay.   From an Enron perspective:       The sale of the equity and the financing of the non-recourse debt on t= he Indian Mesa II project is currently at a standstill due to issues surrou= nding the ambiguities in the PPA        While the debt financing for the Indian Mesa I project is in place (d= ifferent offtaker) the proposed equity sale to AEP is linked to the sale of=  the Indian Mesa II project.       If Enron cannot move forward with the financing of the project within = the next month, Enron will likely end up with approximately $153M less cash=  at year end than it counted on in its plan, in addition to any decrease in=  planned earnings      The after-tax return to Enron in a ""hold"" situation is 0%, due to Enron=  being in the Alternative Minimum Tax position, i.e. it cannot use the tax = benefits.  It was clear in the discussions with the City of San Antonio that these cla= rifications would have had no affect on value.  =20  Tod  -----Original Message----- From: Presto, Kevin M.=20 Sent: Saturday, September 15, 2001 2:41 PM To: Curry, Mike; Lamb, John; Payne, Michael; Lindholm, Tod A.

"With respect to East Power markets, I would like a fixed monthly premium in addition to the wider bid/offer in return for Refco's access to our markets.   -----Original Message----- From:  Cummings, John   Sent: Thursday, September 20, 2001 3:59 PM To: Nowlan Jr., John L.; Arnold, John; Presto, Kevin M.; Goughary, Jim; Wilson, John L.; Belden, Tim Cc: Eichmann, Marc; Richter, Brad; Shults, Bob Subject: REFCO Project Update  Gentlemen  I wanted to provide you an update on the status of the Refco private label platform deal.  We have had several meetings since I first presented the idea to you all.  Unfortunately, Refco's headquarters was in One World Financial Center which was severely damaged by debris from the World Trade Center collapse.  They suffered no human losses from the disaster, but their offices are off limits and all their computers and paper files are inaccessible for the time being.  They are up and running out of a Jersey City location with some back up capability.  To briefly summarize the discussion so far, ENW would build a Refco branded platform similar to EOL that would be accessed by Refco's customers.  Enron would provide transactable prices to the site with wider spreads and potentially smaller minimum volumes.  Refco customers would transact on the site with Refco as their counterparty and Refco would sleeve the transactions to Enron allowing us to consolidate our credit risk to a singular credit, Refco.   The products contemplated include various Nymex look-a-like products and other liquid swaps in oil, natural gas, and electricity.  Revenue would come to Enron in the form of license fees for the platform, transaction fees, and origination from the additional volume create by the wider margin products.  Revenue would come to Refco in the form of transaction fees.  Refco has a similar arrangement in place for FX with Dresner bank and have announced a similar platform for bonds and securities with Cantor Fitzgerald/E-speed.  All that being said, they are anxious to move the discussion forward and we have planned a visit for them to come to Houston in 2 weeks.  Attending will be Gary Weiss, SVP Refco Group Ltd. LLC and President & CEO of Refco F/X Ltd LLC, and Joe Murphy, CEO Refco Futures Ltd. LLC.  The purpose of this visit is for them to give us a presentation on the Refco Group of companies, discuss the products and estimations of revenue streams based on their current futures business, and discuss the possible structure of the deal.  The meeting is scheduled to begin at 2:30pm Thursday Oct 4 and expected to last the balance of the day and possibly into the next morning.  I will approach you all individually to get your feedback on how you would like to interact with them and when.  I realize there are significant issues to be addressed.  Refco currently has some 175,000 collateralized customer accounts ranging from Institutional Investors & locals down to individuals.  We have put these into 2 buckets which have different profiles.  Phase 1 would include the Top 2000 accounts which are largely substantial institutional investors, locals, and high net worth individuals.  If this proves successful, phase 2 would be rolled out with products designed to attract activity from the smaller investors.  The idea would be to automate the products as much as is practical.   Mark Tayor in Legal has already spoken with their counsel and is comfortable that they have reviewed all the legal angles thoroughly.  Refco advises that if the have accounts back up by collateral guaranteed by them, they become Eligible Contract Participants (ECPs) able to execute derivatives.  So, they believe that the majority of the 175,000 accounts they have could be ECPs for the purposes of this deal.  Credit is reviewing the Refco financials and we plan to discuss this thoroughly during their visit.  Please do not hesitate to contact me at x36413 if you have any questions or comments and I will be getting in touch with you early next week to get your feedback.

Cc: Imai, Rika Subject: NRC meetings  Kevin, We are two months into the new contract and have not yet gone to any NRC meetings.  There do not seem to be many that are significant.  I had been expecting (and still am) that a meeting with Palisades ought to be scheduled soon.  I even talked with one of the NRC staff to see if one was going to be coming up.  Although the NRC said that there probably would be one, nothing is yet scheduled.  I also expected a meeting to be conducted with Cook due to the twin outages they are experiencing--but again, nothing yet.  There are a couple on the agenda now that may be of interest--certainly not if we had meetings of real plant problems, but since we have now a contract backlog of four meetings with two more for October, you might want us to attend some of these meetings of lesser import.  1. 10/2/01 - A meeting with the public to discuss DOE's Tritium Production Program.  DOE, NRC, and TVA (representatives from Watts Bar and Sequoyah) will be conducting this meeting.  Since it is just a public informational meeting, there will probably not be much new information given.  But I am sure the public will have opportunity to ask questions, and if you have some questions you would like me to ask, we could do that.  2. 9/26/01 - A meeting to discuss a revision to the NEI document outlining the Regulatory Assessment Performance Indicator Guideline of the Revised Reactor Oversight Process.  Again, it is not something that we absolutely need right now, and we should be able to get the final product later, but it may be helpful to hear discussion so that we can determine what the NRC concerns are and how they will be leaning in inspections.  3. 10/18/01 - A meeting with the commissioners to discuss regulatory reform. This provides a higher level understanding of where the NRC is headed.  This meeting may include discussion of new reactor construction.  That is it for meetings of any kind of interest.  If you want me to go to any of these, please let me know.  You may want to save the meetings in case things get hot and heavy later, but it's kind of doubtful that we would ever exceed the number available especially now with a backlog. Let me know.

We normally do not gyrate this much, but much uncertainty and volatility now.  Firstly, we are writing down demand sharply in the U.S. and around the globe. We are thinking that the US economy will be ugly and outside of a few of the Asian Tigers, worldwide economic activity will be even uglier. Oil demand much weaker but geopolitical issues likely to keep oil prices firm.  In US -  we are now thinking as bad as down 3.5% to down 5% for 4Q01 GDP. Coal just died as a result of this and an MSHA upward revision in production of some 12 MT! Throwing in the towel on coal prices. East could easily lose another $5/Ton.  I told Rogers by email we are now thinking that we could finish up next winter with gas inventory of ~ 1.3 TCF. While we are still refining our thinking, that is a shocking number. It says that yr-on-yr you would lose 3.5 BCF/D of summer injections next summer. It says that the odds of a recovery of gas prices in 2002 are now looking quite bleak. It says that longer dated gas prices could be in under pressure. Up until now, we thought that drilling sector hit could clean this market up enough to get firm prices by summer 2002. Now we the odds are looking bad.  Lastly, emissions -- I am scheduled to have a reasonably high level discussion with Senate Environmental committee. Despite the third priority (1st - Economy; 2nd - Security; and 3rd- Environmental), we are still thinking that enough noise will be made that we are going towards a 6 MM Ton SOX budget by 2007. That is likely bullish unless you discount future values heavily, which we do.  Allan Stewart",s..shively@enron.com,m..presto@enron.com,FW: PIRA Update,2001-09-24 06:11:38-07:00,sent

Additional purchases above 125 MW would be discounted further for VAR and liquidity reasons.  With respect to Florida, I would still pay the mid for Cal 02 (shaped like JEA short) and mid minus $2.00/Mwh for 50 MW of Calender 04-05.  As I mentioned in the meeting, EES/EWS would also provide a bid for ICAP/ancillary services in PJM and NEPOOL where the company has existing short positions.","jim.meyn@enron.com, carl.tricoli@enron.com",m..presto@enron.com,Calpine Deal,2001-09-24 15:29:36-07:00,sent

During their visit here, we are going to go through the various products that we already make markets for and try to come up with a short list of products to start with that would appeal to their customer base.  In regards to the fixed monthly premium, did you have a number in mind and if not what are the variables that would factor into that decision.  You had also said during our initial presentation of the concept to you that you wanted to have a meeting with your various desk heads to make sure all the angles are thought through.

We have had several meetings since I first presented the idea to you all.  Unfortunately, Refco's headquarters was in One World Financial Center which was severely damaged by debris from the World Trade Center collapse.  They suffered no human losses from the disaster, but their offices are off limits and all their computers and paper files are inaccessible for the time being.  They are up and running out of a Jersey City location with some back up capability.  To briefly summarize the discussion so far, ENW would build a Refco branded platform similar to EOL that would be accessed by Refco's customers.  Enron would provide transactable prices to the site with wider spreads and potentially smaller minimum volumes.  Refco customers would transact on the site with Refco as their counterparty and Refco would sleeve the transactions to Enron allowing us to consolidate our credit risk to a singular credit, Refco.   The products contemplated include various Nymex look-a-like products and other liquid swaps in oil, natural gas, and electricity.  Revenue would come to Enron in the form of license fees for the platform, transaction fees, and origination from the additional volume create by the wider margin products.  Revenue would come to Refco in the form of transaction fees.  Refco has a similar arrangement in place for FX with Dresner bank and have announced a similar platform for bonds and securities with Cantor Fitzgerald/E-speed.  All that being said, they are anxious to move the discussion forward and we have planned a visit for them to come to Houston in 2 weeks.  Attending will be Gary Weiss, SVP Refco Group Ltd. LLC and President & CEO of Refco F/X Ltd LLC, and Joe Murphy, CEO Refco Futures Ltd. LLC.  The purpose of this visit is for them to give us a presentation on the Refco Group of companies, discuss the products and estimations of revenue streams based on their current futures business, and discuss the possible structure of the deal.  The meeting is scheduled to begin at 2:30pm Thursday Oct 4 and expected to last the balance of the day and possibly into the next morning.  I will approach you all individually to get your feedback on how you would like to interact with them and when.  I realize there are significant issues to be addressed.  Refco currently has some 175,000 collateralized customer accounts ranging from Institutional Investors & locals down to individuals.  We have put these into 2 buckets which have different profiles.  Phase 1 would include the Top 2000 accounts which are largely substantial institutional investors, locals, and high net worth individuals.  If this proves successful, phase 2 would be rolled out with products designed to attract activity from the smaller investors.  The idea would be to automate the products as much as is practical.   Mark Tayor in Legal has already spoken with their counsel and is comfortable that they have reviewed all the legal angles thoroughly.  Refco advises that if the have accounts back up by collateral guaranteed by them, they become Eligible Contract Participants (ECPs) able to execute derivatives.  So, they believe that the majority of the 175,000 accounts they have could be ECPs for the purposes of this deal.  Credit is reviewing the Refco financials and we plan to discuss this thoroughly during their visit.  Please do not hesitate to contact me at x36413 if you have any questions or comments and I will be getting in touch with you early next week to get your feedback.

Subject: Project X Implementation  I think I've cleared the final issues relating to implementing the new methodology.  The attached file should contain all the impacted portfolio's and related VAR change.  I would like to implement tonight, however I understand that you may need to comment, so I await your feedback.  VaR decreases in both regions, pending on portfolio.  In summary, these factors reflect the following changes (improvements)    ? Changed correlation measure to fixed contract instead of using prompt price history ? Extended factors out past prompt month to 24 months, (previously was for prompt month only)  o Repeating last 12 months (seasonality) for 120 months, and scaled by ff vol ? Updated jumps from 1998 (impacts intra month books) o Introduced regionally correlated jumps ? Mapped F curves to appropriate R and B curves (partially implemented) ? Captured gas leg in spread option (already implemented) ? Captured gas leg in heat rate swaps (already implemented) ? Corrected incorrect curve codes and data input relating to risk type (already implemented)  On our to do list, is the smoothing of FFvol curve combined with the introduction of more factors to model (40). (improving correlations and decreasing VAR instability)  Additionally, we are looking at trying to introduce a fast Fourier transformation to resolve Monte Carlo modeling issues regarding number of simulations.  Convolution VAR will allow us to increase number and accuracy of simulations.  Thank you for your patience, I realize in many ways that this has been a long road.

"Rika,  Please provide an analyst to support this effort.   This information will benefit both EWS and EES as we move toward combining the genco/control area/unit dispatch function in the new building.

The nature of these products puts specific restrictions on availability in terms of available hours for curtailing and generating.  Specifically, with curtailment a customer would not want Enron to be in a position to require the shut down of a manufacturing process all of the time, but through inventory management, they are able to allow some flexibility, with distributed generation, environmental limitations on emissions will likely define the number of hours an asset is available.  We anticipate a typical transaction to be restricted in hours to 500-2000 per year.  As a result of the hourly limitation, the call options need to be priced as, for lack of a better term, super-peaking options.  Today, our models, and price curves allow for 4 hour block pricing of these products.  We do not, however, have our daily volatility curves in the same granularity.  This is where the support of your group is requested.  We would like for you all to use historical hourly data to determine the appropriate scalars for the daily volatility.  We will be supporting NY Zones A, G  and J, NEPOOL, PJM and ERCOT and would like to take an look at each of these markets for individual scalars for each.  I understand that we have data to do the analysis, and simply need to decide the appropriate course of action and do it.  I anticipate it will take a single person one week to complete this task.

"As most of you know, NRG's proposed purchase of two coal plants in Conneticut (UI's territory) was recently cancelled due to regulatory issues at FERC.   The purchase and sale transaction between Wisvest and NRG was originally entered into almost two years ago.   The proposed purchase price of $350 million for 1000 MW of coal was a ""bargain price"" at the time due to environmental risks that are specific to the state of CT.   Over the past 2-3 years, the State of Conneticut has threatened to have these coal plants shut down due to pollution issues and Wisvest was concerned enough about this risk that they ""puked"" the plants to NRG for $350/kW in early 2000.   At a minimum, it is expected that $100-150/kW of SCR and/or scrubbers will be required at these facilities to appease the CT regulatory bodies.   My strong view is that, as a practical matter, the plants cannot be shut down or the lights would go out in CT.   The area where the plants are located is quite possibly the most congested area in the entire Eastern Interconnect.   The load pocket is significantly short MW and transmission import capability is inadequate to serve the load in this area.   In a true ""locational marginal price"" environment, the prices would likely be similar to Zone J in New York   Currently, pricing in NEPOOL is generally socialized with congestion costs spread equally to all loads, regardless of who causes the congestion.      In the recently proposed ""single NE RTO"" model, it is about 80% certain that the PJM ""locational marginal price"" market model will be implemented sometime between mid-2003 and mid-2004.   At that point in time, consumers in the congested areas of NEPOOL (in-city Boston and CT) will be exposed to higher energy prices, while consumers in Maine, New Hampshire, and Rhode Island should see lower prices.   Given the facts above, coupled with traditional asset companies too long to show good bids for incremental assets, I think EWS should pursue discussions with Wisvest immediately and attempt to buy these coal plants at what could be extremely favorable economics relative to our forward curve in NEPOOL and our bullish view for relative pricing at the asset ""node"".      If we could buy these plants for approx $250/kW with $150/kW of environmental upgrades, the resulting ""all-in"" (depr, fixed & variable O&M, fuel costs, NOx, SO2, capital reserve, interest) 7x24 plant cost would be approx. $34-36/Mwh.    This is lower than our energy only socialized NEPOOL curve.   Additional upside is derived from positive basis, ICAP, ancillary services, emissions allowances, and long term requirements sales to LSE's.

It is very important that we schedule some dedicated time with Rogers to better understand our product limitations in the market.  I will look to you to arrange this.    Instead of enabling larger deals through partial commodity master agreement placement, we have only succeeded in impugning the integrity of our larger offering.  Deals now wounded include: ICI Miller/Kraft AGF Crown Cork Heartland (Collins and Aikman, Metaldyne)  MES has scheduled a 1/2 day offsite 10/16 with Blachman.  (Please set time aside to attend) Hopefully, Dave Delainey and Janet will also participate.  At that off site, the originators will present a comprehensive sales plan that effectively lays out the prospecting and closing process against approximately 50 companies over the next 5 quarters.  Efforts will be specifically delineated across commodity in places we have product, with milestones for master/confirm placement and associated gross margin (MTM), plus concurrent timelines for DSM as well.  All this means nothing if we continue to get hammered in the commodity marketplace, however.  If we cannot be competitive with either price or product structure, then we must once again rethink our macro approach to the market.   ---------------------- Forwarded by Michael Mann/HOU/EES on 09/28/2001 07:14 AM ---------------------------   << OLE Object: Picture (Device Independent Bitmap) >>  Enron Energy Services  From:  Rob Rice                           09/27/2001 04:00 PM Phone No: 713-345-8065         To: Jeremy Blachman/HOU/EES@EES, Michael Mann/HOU/EES@EES cc: Michael Moore/HOU/EES@EES, Jeff Forbis/HOU/EES@EES  Subject: Miller RFQ  Miller has indicated to us this afternoon (informally) that our bid was not one of the top two they are considering.

"Excellent update Mike.   We have good momentum with some key ""players"" on the ropes.   I view the next two months as critical in moving the Midwest to one functional market.  -----Original Message-----  From: Roan, Michael  Sent: Fri 9/28/2001 3:57 PM  To: Abler, William; Baughman, Edward D.; Carroll, Lex; Clynes, Terri; Dalton III, Oscar; Kelly, Mike E.; Ratliff, Beau; Sewell, Doug; Valderrama, Larry  Cc: Presto, Kevin M.; Nicolay, Christi L.; Merola, Jeff; Steffes, James D.; Imai, Rika  Subject: Midwest Update    Back in May the MidWest regulatory team received two instructions.  Firstly, build a market in the MidWest that uses LMP to clear real time settlements and secondly ensure that that there is one market operator/RTO (i think the phrase was 'kill the Alliance' or something along those lines...).  The strategy we have, and continue to employ to achieve this is twofold:  - work with the MISO to reshape its day 2 congestion management proposal based on the above instructions.  The MISO is currently proposing a market design consistent with that set out in May (a strawpaper will be circulated in October that i will send around for comment).  - marginalise the Alliance proposal by focusing on its governance structure (all decision rights held by incumbents) while educating stakeholders on the benefits of moving to a more transparent market platform such as that proposed by MISO.  Alliance is currently imploding; one member has left (Detroit Edison) and five are rumoured to be considering their options (Consumers follow DTE to MISO and VEPCO, FE, Comed/Exelon and AEP to PJM).  It is unclear whether these rumours have much basis but as a result of the recent flurry of filing (and more importantly protest) activity, it is clear that the Alliance proposal is totally unacceptable to all stakeholders.  In the last 2 weeks, Enron responded to the following filings:  - MISO and Alliance 120 day compliance filings.  - Alliance business plan.  - National Grid proposal to become Alliance managing member.  - ITC (Detroit Edison) joining MISO.   To summarise these pleadings Enron asked FERC to mandate 1 RTO in the MidWest and set out the its favored governance and market structures (there was a high degree of support from all stakeholder groupings although Enron was the only party to ask for this guidance directly).  On Wednesday FERC took a step in this direction, stating that it wanted a standard market design throughout the US (FERC is believed to support PJM) and that the MidWest structure warranted direct attention in the near future.  Alliance stakeholders took a further step by voting to suspend Alliance market development activities and fold these activities into the MISO process to ensure consistency across the region.  We are also working on further responses to the Alliance 120 day compliance, the MISO/Alliance generator interconnection and a similar intervention in the Indiana state proceeding for transfer of assets to the RTOs to add further weight to Enron's arguments.  So we are seeing action as a result of consistent pressure.  I am now comfortable saying that we are close to achieving the goal (but the fat lady hasn't started her last stanza yet, the Alliance will likely continue to wriggle a little in the coming months )....the downside being that and there is a high probability that the combined MISO/Alliance RTO) will not begin operations on 12/15/01.  So the task in the next month will most likely change from beating up on the incumbents to reconciliation in an effort to get one functional RTO in the MidWest as quickly as possible.  regards  Mike ","michael.roan@enron.com, william.abler@enron.com, d..baughman@enron.com,   lex.carroll@enron.com, terri.clynes@enron.com,   oscar.dalton@enron.com, e..kelly@enron.com, beau.ratliff@enron.com,   doug.sewell@enron.com, larry.valderrama@enron.com",m..presto@enron.com,RE: Midwest Update,2001-09-30 12:05:52-07:00,sent

Subject: Entergy cancels merchant plant in Louisiana  Kevin,  FYI.  I spoke with a guy at Entergy in their merchant plant development group.  They have a site in Louisiana in advanced development (all permits, interconnection, water, etc) including a steam offtake agreement with an industrial host (2x1 combined cycle, 7FA turbines, approx. 550 MW).  They were scheduled to begin construction in the next few weeks.  Given the state of the market, Entergy management has pulled the plug on this project and they are looking to sell everything (permitted site, turbines, steam contract).  He wouldn't tell me where the plant was located in Louisiana except that it was on Entergy's system.  Looking through the development book, it looks like it could be the Lake Charles plant with PPG as steam host?  Given the steam sale, the effective heat rate he quoted was 6700 HHV (new and clean).  I know we aren't in the market for assets right now, but I wanted to pass on the information.  I've given this info to Carson and Jacoby as well.

"I would support this 100%.   It is consistent with the direction that Whalley, Lavo, and Delainey are headed with the retail risk management group.     -----Original Message----- From:  Herndon, Rogers   Sent: Monday, October 15, 2001 7:52 AM To: Presto, Kevin M.; Belden, Tim Subject: Retail Power Structuring - Confidential  Kevin & Tim:  Last week I spoke to Janet about the probable departure of Sean Holmes from EES Deal Management to EES Europe.  Janet discussed several alternatives for Deal Management and asked for my suggestions.  My suggestion is as follows:  Berney Aucoin would assume oversight of all Retail Power Structurning and Deal Management activities.  Initially, keep Deal Management separate under Deb Merrill's direction and Structuring under Edith's direction.  DSM, LC, DG would probably need to fall under Berney as well.  I would anticipate that the functional separation that currently exists between Deal Managment and Structuring would begin to go away over the next 3 - 6 months as we intersperse our more experienced people and everyone in general gets up the curve.  Thus, I would expect that we could merge Deal Managemnt and Strcuturing into one group in the near future.  I spoke to Berney and he thinks this makes sense and is up for the job.  Edith is still planning to move into a commercial Origination role at year end but I believe we could have a replacement by then.  Janet and the EES group have definitely bought into this idea - I think they would like to implement.  Janet would expect dual reporting of the Group (to EES and EWS) and I indicated that, if implemented, I did not see a problem and as far as I was concerned nothing would change - Berney reiterated this directly.  I apoloigize if you are reading this feeling as though I have taken the liberty to suggest material changes without getting full buy-in, but 1) things aren't done and 2) I wanted to suggest something that I felt made sense before some alternative plan was proposed and in execution mode.  Please let me know what you think and whether you feel Lavo would have any problems.

"Kevin:  As I mentioned in a voice mail a couple of weeks ago, Reliant has expressed some concerns about the current EnronOnline notification process for changes to power products.

I had heard nothing else for a couple of weeks, and to date Reliant's use of EOL apparently has not been affected.  However, one of Reliant's attorneys, Dede Russo, called me yesterday to discuss the issue again.

However, one of Reliant's attorneys, Dede Russo, called me yesterday to discuss the issue again.  I spoke with Rogers Herndon yesterday about Reliant's concerns, and Rogers perceives a real risk that Reliant will discontinue its use of EOL if we do not respond to their concerns.

There were no objections to my thoughts on structure so we have concentrated on the rationale supporting RTO's and effective spot markets as mechanisms that achieve the goals of ICAP (i.e A spot market is Enrons solution).  We then state that if others have different views, any resulting separate iCap proposal if implemented should be interim in nature and minimise spot market distortions.

The plant is in Tampa, FL and the offering is unit-contingent.    TECO prefers to sell a toll where we bring the gas, but is open to other proposals.  I figure we can bid for any of a few structures: 1) toll where we bring the gas, 2) toll indexed to a gas hub, where TECO is respons. for gas supply, 3) fixed price call.    I think an at the money call would be the cleanest solution (avoid inefficiency's associated with the heat rate curve which varies by MW amount utilized, gas supply risk, etc.).

There are a co= uple of issues we need to address for the RFP.  I will list them out, give = you my suggestions and then please comment and send back.  1) The City is asking for a possible 30 day holding period for pricing so t= hey can get together and vote on the award of the contract I think we can do one of two things:  we can say pricing is indicative and = will be set once the bid is awarded.  Or we can say that we will hold price= s, however, for every X% move in gas our power price will move accordingly,=  given a stated correlation, and our price will only move up and not down. =  Or we could do a % move in MW Daily Index, but I think that index can be a=  poor indicator of forward curve fluctuations.  2) Appropriations Risk - There is not much we can do here except keep it to=  a one year deal.  However, I am having them look into a possible costless = collar for the City.  They are, by definition, short going forward and left=  exposed to higher prices.  If wholesale prices are say 35, we sell them a = higher priced call and we buy a lower price put at offsetting option premiu= ms for say cal 03.  That way they can hedge their risk costlessly.  The wor= st case scenarios for them are 1) they buy say $40 power (if that is the ca= ll strike), or 2) they buy $30 power (if that is our put strike).  If I was=  a city, this is what I would do to hedge if I could not do a longer term d= eal.  There are some issues here though.  If they do not get appropriated t= he money, we might not be able to exercise our put.  If EES management deci= des they are comfortable with appropriations risk, I think an option premiu= m is better risk than out right hedging against a possible phantom position= .  Second alternative is that we can sell the fixed retail gen past the app= ropriations date and we, as a desk, can collar it to hedge out our marked t= o market risk.  This of course would only hedge our wholesale risk but that=  should be about 80-90% of the risk.  Right now these are the major issues facing the desk on this deal.  Please = let me know your thoughts.  Thanks.  By the way, you missed a good dinner l= ast night.

"  -----Original Message----- From: Hawthorn, Jay  Sent: Friday, October 19, 2001 8:49 AM To: Suarez, John Subject: Enron CFO's Tie to a Partnership   October 19, 2001 Money & Investing Enron CFO's Tie to a Partnership Resulted in Big Profits for the Firm By REBECCA SMITH and JOHN R. EMSHWILLER  Staff Reporters of THE WALL STREET JOURNAL   A limited partnership organized by Enron Corp.'s chief financial officer, Andrew S. Fastow, realized millions of dollars in profits in transactions it did with Enron, according to an internal partnership document.  The partnership, in some instances, benefited from renegotiating the terms of existing deals with the Houston energy company in ways that improved the partnership's financial positions or reduced its risk of losses.  Mr. Fastow, and possibly a handful of partnership associates, realized more than $7 million last year in management fees and about $4 million in capital increases on an investment of nearly $3 million in the partnership, which was set up in December 1999 principally to do business with Enron.    The profits from the deals were disclosed in a financial report to investors in the partnership, LJM2 Co-Investment LP, that was signed by Mr. Fastow as the general partner and dated April 30. In one case, the report indicates the partnership was able to improve profits by terminating a transaction early.  The LJM2 arrangement has become controversial for Enron, as shareholders and analysts have raised questions about whether it posed a conflict by putting the company's chief financial officer, who has a fiduciary duty to Enron shareholders, in a position of reaping financial rewards for representing LJM2 investors in business deals with Enron. Investors in LJM2 include Wachovia Corp., General Electric Co.'s General Electric Capital Corp. and Credit Suisse Group's Credit Suisse First Boston.  Attention has focused on Mr. Fastow's partnership activities at a tumultuous time for Enron, which over the past decade grew enormously by becoming the nation's biggest energy-trading company.  This year, though, it has been hit by a string of troubles, from soured business initiatives to executive departures. On Tuesday, Enron announced a $618 million third-quarter loss, because of a $1.01 billion write-off on investments in broadband telecommunications, retail energy services and Azurix Corp., a water company. A small chunk of that write-off, about $35 million, was attributed to ending certain LJM2-related transactions. That termination also produced a $1.2 billion reduction in Enron shareholder equity as the company decided to repurchase 55 million shares that had been part of LJM2 deals.  1Enron Says Its Links to a Partnership Led to $1.2 Billion Equity Reduction (Oct. 18)   At 4 p.m. Thursday in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Enron was down 9.9%, or $3.20, to $29 a share. Within the past year, the stock had topped $80 a share.  Enron officials didn't have any comment about the LJM2 partnership document. Enron has consistently said its dealings with LJM2 have been proper. They said the LJM2 deals, like ones done with other parties, were aimed at helping hedge against fluctuating market values of its assets and adding sources of capital.  Mr. Fastow has declined several requests for an interview about LJM2. In late July, he formally severed his ties with LJM2, as a result of what Enron officials said was growing unease by Wall Street analysts and major shareholders. Mr. Fastow has been finance chief of Enron since 1997 and has been with the firm 11 years, which included extensive work setting up and managing company investments.  Michael Kopper, a former Enron executive who an Enron spokesman said is now helping to operate LJM2, declined to comment. He also wouldn't describe his relation to LJM2.  In his April 30 report, Mr. Fastow said the partnership, which raised $394 million, had invested in several Enron-related deals involving power plants and other assets as well as company stock. The document said LJM2 sought a 29% internal rate of return. That was down from a 48% targeted rate of return at the end of 2000, which the document said was due in part to a decline in the value of LJM2's investment in New Power Co., an Enron-related energy retailer. In some transactions, LJM2 did much better than the 29% target, though this sometimes involved renegotiating individual deals.  In September 2000, the partnership invested $30 million in ""Raptor III,"" which involved writing put options committing LJM2 to buy Enron stock at a set price for six months. Four months into this deal, LJM2 approached Enron to settle the investment early, ""causing LJM2 to receive its $30 million capital invested plus $10.5 million in profit,"" the report said. The renegotiation was before a decline in Enron's stock price, which could have forced LJM2 to buy Enron shares at a loss of as much as $8 each, the document indicated.

I think it would be beneficial for us to attend.  Again, since this is a conference rather than an NRC meeting, I would suggest the trade-off of us paying for flight, hotel, and all other expenses and time if you would pick up the conference cost ($1395.00 discounted ""early bird"" rate).

This is interesting because due to the recent discoveries of cracked and leaking vessel head penetrations (like that at Oconee 3), all PWRs are required by Bulletin 2001-01 to perform inspections and provide information related to the structural integrity of the upper reactor pressure vessel head penetration nozzles to ensure the integrity of the reactor coolant system pressure boundary and to demonstrate compliance with applicable regulatory requirements.  Davis-Besse, however, wants to defer this inspection/assurance information until their refueling outage in the Spring of 2002.  The NRC has 4 categories of plants according to risk for penetration cracking.  They are: 1. Plants that already experienced cracks (Oconee 1, 2, 3; ANO 1; Cook 2) 2. Plants that are considered with high susceptibility (Davis-Besse, and six other plants) 3. Plants that are considered with moderate susceptibility (32 plants) 4. Plants that are considered with low susceptibility So, with Davis-Besse in the high susceptible category, the NRC may require them to provide assurance requiring an inspection and therefore an outage.  MEETING 2.  10/25/01 - The day after the above meeting is a meeting concerning the Pebble Bed reactor.  This is the reactor type that Exelon is pushing for construction and use in the US.  Exelon will be discussing with the NRC the biggest possible ""showstopper"" for the design--the graphite coolant.  Graphite can burn (e.g. Chernobyl).  However, pebble bed proponents say it is unlikely.  The NRC should provide info on their concerns and leanings which would steer Exelon one way or another.  So far this contract year, we have attended two meetings.  That leaves us currently with a backlog of four meetings through this month and a rate of use of .67 meetings per month which would make the projected use for the year of about eight of the 24 meetings allowed in the contract.  If we attend the above two meetings, the backlog would be down to two; the rate would be 1.33 per month; and the projected yearend total would still be only about 16.  Let me know as soon as possible since meeting #1 is scheduled for tomorrow so I would need to make plans.

Retail load About 18 MW peak, 17 MW off-peak.  October 4th - First account was switched.  By November 6th - Remaining accounts will be switched Issue - Some Lockheed Martin accounts that aren't in the batch. Issue - Trying to get positions correctly reflected in positions report - Jeff Jackson Issue - Data we are getting from RPS is incorrect.  Interface with EWS Wholesale To date - Met with EPMI and discussed management (when will position be transferred? how? at what price?) of retail position. Tom May to discuss with Rogers.  Issue - How will we pass through intrazonal congestion costs? This isn't an issue for the pilot, but will be an issue on 1/1/2002.  Intramonth book development November 1 - Expect to have volume management/reporting capability.  November 1 - Expect to have MTM calculations ???- Expect to have all other reporting capabilities functioning. Will meet with Richard Bird this week to develop a new timeline.  Working with CSC to develop a method to obtain actual customer usage on a timely basis.  Load forecasting Issue - There is a significant difference (at least in % terms) between the Packaged Ice position per the positions report and Frazier's forecast. Appears the majority of this difference is due to some Packaged Ice accounts being booked more than once. Issue - Forecasting by zone (vs. at the account level) may lead to inaccuracies in P&L reporting.  ? Customer switching process Jeff Merola to determine roles and responsibilities  ?

"Kevin,  The actual numbers are $2.9 for LCRA and 2.09 for Green Mountain. The LCRA number was for the transmission spread to Austin and can be released as we have Sandhill and the transmission market is no longer set up as it was in Sept 2000.

As a reminder, the meeting includes discussions on major nuclear, generation, and transmission topics by all the key officials (Meserve-NRC, Wood-FERC, Blake-DOE, Bingaman-Senate, Connaughton-White House, Bayless-Dynegy, Peterson-NRG Energy, Rogers-Cinergy). Conference cost - $1395 (We pay time and expenses). Again, I'm bringing this up only because of the discount expiration coming up.  After this, I won't bother you with it again. It seems a valuable opportunity to understand the direction from all governmental regulators plus major industry viewpoints. If we do this meeting, the count for all completed and scheduled meetings through December will be six out of the contract allowable ten.  That gives a backlog of four meetings; a rate of 1.2 meetings per month; and a projected contract year completion of 14.5 meetings out of an allowable 24. Let me know.

Bellemare Vice President=20     <http://secure.scientech.com/rci/wsimages/rbellrgb100border.jpg>  Constellation Energy's (NYSE:CEG) shares fell nearly 11 percent on Friday i= n response to announcements that the company is cutting its earnings' proje= ctions, shelving plans to split the company into two parts, and severing it= s ties with investment bank Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) which would have been a=  minority partner in its energy-trading operation if the spin-off had gone = ahead.=20  Analysis: Constellation Energy's stock value dropped to its lowest level in=  seven years-down nearly 11 percent in one day, and down over 45 percent si= nce May 1, 2001. But perhaps what is most important about Constellation is = its shift in business strategy as it becomes the second company of the week=  to announce it is withdrawing plans to split its company into two parts. E= arlier in the week Allegheny Energy (NYSE:AYE) announced it would hold off = on its planned initial public offering (IPO) of Allegheny Energy Supply Com= pany, its unregulated power generation and trading subsidiary, until market=  conditions improve.=20  The dramatic shift in company strategy appears to be driven by the same for= ces. Constellation sited falling energy prices, the changing nature of the = California power crisis and weak economic conditions as the main reasons fo= r dropping its company-separation plans. The company said it would now focu= s on using its ""single"" status to leverage its balance sheet to participate=  in the consolidation of the wholesale electricity industry in the United S= tates. ""What seems to matter now is size and stability and we think that co= mes from being a single company ? What has changed (in the last one year) i= s the significant change in the immediate growth rate we are seeing for new=  power plants ? the reasons are simple and profound. The world has changed,= '' Constellation Energy Chairman Christian Poindexter said in a conference = call with the media.=20  The change in Constellation's strategy will be costly. The company will pay=  Goldman Sachs about $355 million to terminate their power-marketing agreem= ent, $159 million which Goldman had previously put in the business, and $19= 6 million in future income Goldman would have earned had the business conti= nued. Constellation expects the Goldman Sachs business termination will cau= se the company to record a $200-million special expense in the fourth quart= er. The company said that its split-up with Goldman Sachs was amicable. Gol= dman's relationship with Constellation started in the mid-nineties when the=  investment bank was looking for a partner to help it break into the energy=  trading and marketing business. In 1999 Goldman agreed it would take a 17.= 5-percent stake in Constellation's trading business when the state of Maryl= and deregulated the power industry and Constellation decided to make a sepa= rate trading company. Poindexter indicated that Goldman did not want to be = part of a situation where energy trading and generation would remain togeth= er.=20  It certainly has been an active week for Constellation as it has made other=  significant announcements concerning its future plans. Mayo A. Shattuck II= I was elected to the position of president and CEO effective Nov. 1, 2001. = Shattuck recently resigned his position as chairman and CEO of Deutsche Ban= c. Alex Brown and has served on Constellation's board of directors for the = past seven years. On Oct. 24, the New York Public Service Commission said i= t would approve the sale of Niagara Mohawk's Nine Mile nuclear generating s= tation in New York to Constellation Nuclear for $780 million. Constellation=  Nuclear is a unit of the Constellation Energy Group. As part of the sale, = Constellation has agreed to sell 90 percent of Nine Mile's output at fixed = prices for 10 years, or through August 2009 if the operating license of Nin= e Mile 1 is not extended.=20  The unregulated generation and trading activities continue to drive the bul= k of earnings for both Constellation and Allegheny. Constellation's domesti= c merchant energy business contributed $0.89 of their $1.00 earnings per sh= are of common stock for the quarter ending Sept. 30, 2001, slightly higher = than last year when the business contributed $0.87 of the $0.98 per share i= n earnings for the same quarter. Allegheny Energy reported that their third= -quarter profits more than doubled on increased generation capacity and the=  acquisition of a trading and marketing unit. Allegheny's third-quarter ear= nings were $1.33 per share, compared with $0.69 per share one year ago, and=  beating analysts' earnings of $1.10 to $1.28 per share. Allegheny is confi= dent that its year-end earnings will be within its guidance range of $3.80 = to $4.10 per share.=20  Despite the strong earnings, Allegheny's stock price has dropped over 30 pe= rcent since May, and over 5 percent in the past 10 trading days. The drop i= n energy stock value appears to be driven by softening wholesale power pric= es. Earlier in the month Lehman Brothers lowered its estimate of Allegheny'= s 2002 earnings by 12 cents, to $4.03, citing reduced forward power price a= ssumptions.=20  The high-flying days of the recent past, where energy companies' price-to-e= arnings (P/E) multiples were exceeding 50 in certain cases, appear to be ov= er. Many power producers are returning to their roots-scrapping plans for s= plitting operations and questioning whether more risky overseas operations = can be supported by lower prices brought on by a slowing economy and soften= ing wholesale market prices. Paul Patterson, an energy analyst with ABN Amr= o, said there are common themes affecting the industry: ""One is lower power=  prices and the margins that are associated with them. And two is lower sto= ck prices and the ability to finance more asset driven growth.""=20  AES Corp. (NYSE:AES ), apparently agrees. Its earnings fell for a second co= nsecutive quarter on poor results from operations in Brazil and Britain and=  said last Thursday it would revamp its organization and did not rule out s= elling off assets. AES' Chief Executive Officer Dennis Bakke indicated AES = was placing a renewed emphasis on the traditionally profitable, long-term c= ontract generation business. By placing generating capacity into long-term = contracts a company is able to provide profit stability during times of fla= t growth. Just one year ago physical reserve margins in power markets were = very low, allowing generation companies to achieve high profits for their p= roduct. But with the slowing economy, mild weather and consumer response to=  the higher prices, power demand for 2001 is flat or even down from one yea= r ago in many parts of the country.=20  The recent actions of Constellation, Allegheny and AES likely indicate a fu= ndamental shift in the electric business. Their actions are, in some respec= ts, a return to the past-companies striving for predictability and reliabil= ity in their power supply costs, profits and operations. Perhaps most signi= ficantly, companies are once again rethinking their strategy in regard to w= hether or not they will continue to be an integrated business. As Constella= tion concluded, one way to achieve and maintain a critical mass of business=  is to remain an integrated company. We would not be surprised if others co= me to the same conclusion.=20   An archive list of previous IssueAlerts is available at www.scientech.com <http://secure.scientech.com/issuealert/>=20   We encourage our readers to contact us with their comments.

"Kevin,  Tomorrow I am meeting with 2 separate consulting groups that represent collectively 15 EMCs in Georgia.  As a result of our calling efforts, it appears as if these 15 are some of the larger EMCs under Oglethorpe.  I think these 2 groups are planning to break apart from OPC and form 2 new agencies (7 in one, 8 in the other).  I plan to get as many details on this as possible during the meetings.  There are 2 opportunities at this point with specific EMCs in each of these groups.  Both are to buy energy on the Georgia ITS.  1) 75MW, 7x24, Jan-Feb'02, and 2) 20MW, 7x24, 3-5 yrs., beginning 1/1/03, prefer load following at a 73% load factor, but will consider a block purchase.  I'm going to get more details on these separate requests, but wanted your initial interest level.

"I received a call this evening from our V&E regulatory counsel (Adam Wenner) who received a call from Dynegy's regulatory attorney, Dan King, about the need for both companies to making filings at FERC to notify FERC of the proposed acquisition and to state that, during the pendency of the acquisition, both companies will treat each other as if the two were already merged (i.e., the standards of conduct and affilate rules will apply).    Under FERC's regulations, as of the date of the agreement, Enron and Dynegy must conduct themselves as if they are already merged.  Therefore, Enron can no longer enter into transactions with Illinois Power to buy or sell power absent FERC approval under section 205 of the Federal Power Act, and Dynegy cannot enter into transactions with Portland General absent prior FERC approval.  With regard to the sale and purchase of non-power goods and services, all non-power goods and services provided by Illinois Power to Enron must be priced at the higher of cost or market. Any non-power goods or services provided by Enron to IP must be priced at a level that does not exceed market price.  We will work with the attorneys to make these filings, but we wanted you to know as soon as possible that we need to stop power sales and purchases with Illinois Power (if we were doing any) and can only enter into transactions with them with prior FERC approval.  We will send a draft of the FERC filing to you for review.  Please let us know if this restriction causes problems for you (e.g., you have existing or forward contracts with IP that are in effect or are scheduled to go into effect during the pendency of the acquisition).  Let us know if you have any questions.  Sarah",m..presto@enron.com,sarah.novosel@enron.com,Enron/Dynegy Transaction and Affiliate Rules,2001-11-12 19:07:59-08:00,received

I am told it is the same as Alleghenny but have not seen.  I think they are still working on language, etc., but I get conflicting signals as I think they are already talking pricing - who knows.   I am not even sure what regions - these guys are operating in stealth mode as usual.    I have reiterated to Deb Merrill and Janet that these deals need to come through the traditional sales channels once the Master and Confirms have been agreed to (we need to be comfortable with Master and Confirm before any pricing is contemplated).  Specifically, we need to make sure that 1)  Legal provides us a detailed gap analysis between contracts (purchase vs. sales), 2) all pricing comes through traditional channels (deal mgmnt/commodity structuring), 3) we know exactly how this is priced in relation to mid-offer, consider residual desk risk and 4) most importantly, we need to know exactly what type of orig. is being anticipated.  On the last point, I do not contemplate granting any orig for supply marked above our mids.  My view on this is that if they want to bring in supply between our mid-offer, they can sell this supply directly to customers, I do not plan to manage the risk.

"We should condition all ""free"" sleeve trades on future trades with the counterparty.   For example if Reliant does not do at least 20 trades per week with Enron, then an $0.25/Mwh charge will apply.   I simply don't believe these guys will do incremental business with us at this time so why not make some money in the sleeving process.   I can almost assure you that these counterparties are motivated to do these trades anyway.   Once they are done cleaning there books with us, they will do very limited business (only very large margin deals like the 4 yr EES supply deal and then command a huge cash collateral.).

I have two separate sheets in the file according to the way it is sorted - one is by counterparty and the other is by region.

"Kevin,   Jon Hoff summarized the East Power positions in the attached spreadsheet.  If he did it correctly, I beleive it says that to purchase power from 12/27 through 12/31, you need a total of $18MM.  However, the $18MM includes $4.5MM for PJM and $5.5MM for Nepool, which we are working on seperate payment/prepayment terms right now (this assumes we purchase ALL Nepool and PJM power from the pools).  As such, what you need immediately is a little over $8MM for bilateral deals to prepay for power outside of PJM and Nepool for the period of 12/27 through 12/31.   In total, $18MM of power purchases will generate $20.5MM of receipts, or a little over $2.5MM net for the estate.   Question - this sheet shows Ameren is negative $194M over the three days. Are you serving to preserve a contract that turns positive later?    If this sheet is fair and accuarte, let me know and I will forward to Bowen and DeSpain tonight.  It probably makes sense to get on the phone on Monday with them and knock this out quickly.  I don't anticipate any problems.   Don 713-529-6280.

I am happy that we got that win even if it was clouded by the  bigger issues facing the firm.  Looks like the MidWest will get one RTO and  congestion mgmt protocol....  While the news wasn't celebrated around here for obvious reasons, i also  believe that this outcome will be better for AEP in the long run.  I am  hopeful that the executives here see it the same way in time and look  forward to 2002.  Hope that things work out well for all of you, i enjoyed  the experience even if it was cut short.

If a new entity purchases the Enron trading business and the contingent employment agreement executed on January 5, 2002 becomes a valid and binding agreement, Enron's management will not initiate a lawsuit to recover the 2001 performance bonus payments. Enron and/or purchaser of the Enron trading business will seek approval from the bankruptcy judge of the 2001 performance bonus payments to eliminate any future uncertainty with respect to the validity of those payments. To the extent the total retention $'s available for the Enron trading business employees is increased above current levels (from the leading bidder as of January 5, 2002), the intent of Enron's senior management is to make an upward adjustment to the individual employees who have committed to the new entity such that the employee maintains a substantially similar percentage of the total ""pool"" of retention $'s.

"Kevin  Wanted to keep you in the loop on the interest rate / fx stuff.   Harry   -----Original Message----- From:  Arora, Harry   Sent: Tuesday, January 08, 2002 10:21 AM To: Kitchen, Louise; White, Stacey W.; Webb, Jay Cc: Lavorato, John Subject: RE: Interest Rates  Following the discussions I have had with Louise and Jay, this is the proposed solution to the interest rate risk management in NEWCO.   1. For the first few weeks ( to a few months) we continue to use Infinity to update the curves at 2 PM. I will need to have one trader to execute, mark curves and do any deals for foreign exchange (Cd$ etc.). Louise, I hope you have this in your budget and headcount. I will need one junior trader(and maybe two as things grow) to help do this job.  I have lined up one of the guys in the old trading desk, if this goes forward.  2. In the first few weeks, Jay Webb and myself are hoping to acquire a lighter, and much simpler interest rate package which will allow us to do what we do, with significantly lower costs. We also will re-design the way we aggregate interest rate risk in the commodity books, to make it simpler and easier. To ensure there is no more discussion ever of drift-reallocation, I propose a method where, every desk head gets back his complete interest rate portfolio drift every month or quarter (less any transaction expenses ).  I would expect that, the interest rate curve shift will be small till we build a somewhat longer dated portfolio, while the drift could start becoming substantial pretty quickly (as we start making money).  Hope this answers the questions. We will have the curves at the right time, done by the trading group. We will still measure and manage our own exposure to both interest rates and currencies.  We intend to allocate small VAR to that risk management. We would deal primarily with one or two counterparties - the parent bank and a couple of futures brokers to manage the risk.    Just to be very clear, while I am happy to manage this risk (with extra help), I am primarily  interested in the running of power options and structured products.

The employee currently has a base pay of $185 ,004.00.  A clause in the UBS Optional Life Insurance policy states  ""evidence o f insurability is required for coverage of over 3 times your base salary or $700 ,000, whichever is less.""   What will this employee need to keep their coverage  at approximately the same level during the transition to UBS?  Would a confirmat ion statement from Enron for 2002 Open Enrollment elections suffice as  ""evidenceof insurability""?

To date, our working assumption has been that all fundamentals systems (data harvesting, portals, metastock, decision support cubes, etc...) would only be operational in NetCo.  There is no IT staffing in estate to support fundamentals.  Beth Perlman told me today that Jim Fallon has indicated that we need to have IT people in estate who have the ability to bring up our fundamentals capability for the East and West Desks.  A few questions...  Do you agree?  If so, I can have our East Desk fundamentals team begin knowledge transfer to estate IT personnel.  I'll work with Beth on candidates.

"I view the sharing of the fundies databases and associated web sites (gas and power) with the Estate as a serious commercial issue that we should not ignore.   The estate can not only use the proprietary information as a competitor in the trading business, but they could potentially sell the data to multiple competitors.  I can't imagine that this data was agreed to be shared by UBS and the Estate.   I am not planning on giving any of the data to the Estate.

The conference will  review the parameters of these challenges and possible solutions to them.  It will examine technology options and  new business models for transmission expansion.  It will analyze emerging proposals for  effective transmission planning and pricing, including market-based pricing  alternatives to FERC's traditional pricing methods.

The conference will also present updates on the status of the various  markets (including market design and operation problems and their solutions,  successes, prices and costs) in North America. These markets include New  England, New York, PJM, ERCOT, and Alberta. Developing markets, such as Ontario,  will also be covered. The market designs encompass issues such as day-ahead  scheduling, real-time operation, integration with the markets for energy and  congestion, measuring the real-time delivery of these services, the operating  costs to produce these services, and the potential for customer loads to supply  these services.

"I want to make sure that we are adopting a policy whereby any material changes to employment agreements for individual employees are adopted across the board so we are creating consistency for all employees with respect to contract terms and conditions.   I think this is very important from an execution and timing standpoint.   I want to be able to represent to employees that ""lawyering"" the docs to death is not necessary, because we are going to maintain consistency for all employees.

Subject: Steve Marland   Kevin -   Just an FYI - Steve Marland resigned from Reliant very recently.  Steve had been trading their term Midwest book and has previously covered the SE I believe.  I think Steve is a good trader, played the regional/time spreads very effectively, and is not afraid to put size on when appropriate.  I just think that Reliant's management team is ""old school"" and Steve was not being able to effectuate the changes he saw necessary (apparently, they would not even let him trade NG against his positions).   Steve just wanted to clear his head and get away.  He is looking at the opportunities everyone else is at the moment and is not in a rush.  I know he wants to work with a bright group that thinks the way he does.  I have told him that he should talk to you guys.  You may want to contact him directly when you have the green light to look outside ENE.  I have known Steve for awhile and think he could be a good fit - I think Fletch has met him and dealt with him in the markets as well.   Steve's cell number is 713-962-0274.

There is no pre-notice period for withdrawal and Dick feels that it would leave the FRCC relationship in a better light if EPMI withdraws, rather than not paying the invoice.  I tend to agree if EPMI has no further ongoing interests in trading in Florida.  UBS trading can make an application and join at any time, without an initiation fee.  Kevin/Paul--Is it ok for EPMI to withdraw?  If so, I'll draft the letter.    Thanks.

A couple of outstanding questions-   1. Who am I reporting to?  I would welcome the opportunity to report to you or Greg.  I think my job was a lot easier in the past because our group had the backing of the Office of the Chair. This gave us credibility, independence, and the chance to contribute to strategic issues as well as the tactical issues of interest to the traders. However, I am obviously open to any reporting relationship you might suggest and I understand that my day-to-day duties will consist largely of interaction with the Fundy teams.  2. Are there any slots that have opened because of offers that were not accepted?  I would love to be able to take one of the folks from my group with me, particularly Kristin Walsh or my assistant Sharon Purswell.  Thanks again for the great offer and the chance to join UBS.

"Filing looks good.  My vote is go forward with a clean 205 filing as attached.   If we file the 203 as well, FERC will gravitate directly toward that.   I think we retain more flexibility if we stick with the 205 approach.   Other thoughts?   I will be in Florida (vacation) Wednesday through Friday.

There is an interesting discussion on the drought and some drought impacts which could hype the market abit. We did not intend to do so but nobody really knows due to the lack of precedents. Before the drought considerations, I would not have wanted to be short the whole Northeast JUL/AUG. With those risks, it further makes the case. I personally think the gas weakness will come late like last year (Aug/Sep/Oct). That is not in our reference case.  Otherwise, this report is pretty bearish overall.  In the future, I would like to have ongoing discussions with you, and establish parameters to make sure I economize your time and screen out material you have little interest in. Obviously, we need to talk about only those issues that have the highest expected values based upon our assessments of the market fundamentals and the risks around those outlooks.  Thanks for establishing the relationship with us. Morris and I will work hard to make it worth your while.
