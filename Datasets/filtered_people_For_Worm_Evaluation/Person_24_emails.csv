A higher bid was submitted prior to  Wednesday's 1 p.m. MST      deadline in a four-day open season, a pipeline spokesman said. However,  the original      negotiating party has until this afternoon to match the new price and  retain the capacity.        The new bid was for $38 million over one year starting Jan. 1, about $8  million more than      the amount in Friday's announcement ($30 million). One source called it  ""ridiculous"" that      someone was willing to pay so much for the space, given that on a  mark-to-market basis      the capacity is worth only about $20-25 million.        Late last week some sources speculated that Duke Energy was the  recipient of next      year's package given its large power generation holdings in California.  A marketer      yesterday said he believed Dynegy upped the ante. ""Rather than go  through all the      hassles they [Dynegy] had at FERC with the 1998-99 package, they let  someone else do      all the work this time and then came in late with a higher bid. That way  no one can      complain that the procedure was tainted. After all, Dynegy has quite a  few power plants      in California to keep fueled, and all of their current FT on El Paso  expires at the end of      this year. Of course, they still could be thwarted if the original  negotiated customer      matches their bid. It may all sound kind of Machiavellian but sort of  makes sense."" Other      sources heavily discounted the chances of Dynegy being the new high  bidder, pointing out      that the company made significantly less than expected this year because  San      Juan/border basis differentials narrowed significantly. A Dynegy source  indicated that the      company was involved in the bidding and lost to Duke in the first round.        Regardless of what happens next year, a marketer noted that the Southern  California      border/San Juan basis spread continues to compress as SoCal Gas  withdraws from      storage and east-of-California utilities exercise their peaking  contracts because of cold      weather in the Rockies and elsewhere in the West. From a December index  spread of 29      cents, the border/basin gap was down to about 18 cents Wednesday, she  said.

Jeff and the whole team did an excellent job of drawing them into the discussion.  By the end of both sessions I thought that they seemed genuinely interested in the proposal and anxious to see the filing.  Mike Coleman went so far as to suggest that to the extent we can make the case the this will be a tool in the generation siting process, we would be helping his group with Chairman Hoecker's directive for staff to develop concepts to respond to the SW power crunch.     Attendees Rates/Tariff Group Attendees (OMTR Rates West):  Mike Coleman, Bob Petrocelli, John Carlson Policy Group Attendees:  Ed Murrell,  Laurel Hyde, Kim Bruno, Kathleen Dias & Demi Pulas   Things They Liked Service/Rate Structure.  They seemed to like the fact that the underlying agreement is an FT and fact that the transaction remained subject to current rate provisions. Open bidding for shipper calls We will only sell call options when we have available capacity The underlying FT and the option amendment can be released to another shipper through capacity release   Concerns that Need to Be Addressed in the Filing Concentration of capacity/hoarding/affiliate issues.  Mike Coleman said that we need to address this issue head on in light of El Paso/CPUC cases.  They are worried that huge block of future capacity rights could be tied up by a single offering.  On the other hand, he said that perhaps we can use this filing as an opportunity to explain how our bidding on shipper calls adds improved transparency and protections.  One possible way to address this is to promise that the time frame for posting/bidding on shipper calls will depend on the size of the block.  (e.g. a 20 M/D package might involve a day bidding process, a 100 M/D block may involve a week posting). Demonstrate that puts/calls don't undercut the release market.  Explain that release is used for day to day decisions, while we believe options will serve to help shippers with longer term strategic decision. Be specific about any waivers of the part 284 regulations. Work on the definition of the 4 options types.  They stumbled over some of the wording, like the use of phrase ""recall"" in the transporter call.   Detailed Notes We had a surprisingly positive reception from Rates West.  This could be due in part to Mike Coleman's reputed continued interest on the electric side and his self-proclaimed corporate bent.  He did say that he understands the underlying business drivers for this program  and suggested that a flushed out narrative with the filing to explain these would help our efforts. He said that the timing on this type of offering is good now, as the Chairman is pressuring Staff to improve the marketplace (the California situation again).  Both groups suggested that we needed to lay out as much detail as possible in the filing, including examples of each type of options.    As Mike delineated and we expected, the major issues that may cause discomfort are affiliate abuse and capacity hoarding (cornering the market under a long-term option) or speculative capacity holding.  To defend the service, we should lay out the impacts and explain why this offers an improvement over our present situation (discounted firm).    Some Specific Questions from the Rates group included:  How does this impact capacity release  How does TW protect against hoarding  Why aren't all options considered negotiated rates.   Are options tradable alone (without capacity)  Would the availability of options change the volume of capacity held by ENA  How are ROFRs affected   Some Specific Questions from the Policy group included:  What are discriminating parameters/business decisions in allocating capacity  How are competing offers allocated when in excess of available capacity  How are options posted, bid on?    What are parameters of the options, specify range & degree of flexibility (explain whether strike dates are fixed)   What is the ""trigger"" or notice period for either a Call or Put; is it in the contract  Is this a physical or financial product  Does this verge into negotiated T&C territory?  Is this like Koch's option proposal?  (No - Koch offers an option on price only)   ",kimberly.watson@enron.com,jeffery.fawcett@enron.com,TW Options Pre-Filing Meetings With FERC Today,2000-10-05 19:53:00-07:00,received

Only one item was discussed - an order resolving the Amoco complaint over El  Paso's capacity allocation.  In the order, the Commission finds that El  Paso's allocation of delivery point capacity at Topock is unjust &  unreasonable.  The Commission directs El Paso to assign primary point rights  to its shippers using a one-time assignment process outlined in the order.   If elections for primary point capacity exceed available space, El Paso will  pro rate the space and allow shippers to select other primary points in an  iterative fashion until all shippers have primary point rights equal to their  firm capacity rights.  Chairman Hoecker said this case illustrates the fact  that overbooking pipeline capacity is even more problematic that the  overbooking of airline capacity.

Per discussions with Rod, we will set up a separate S-work order to move these costs into, close out the J-w/o, and add a separate line item in the 2nd Capital Current Estimate.

No additional approvals will be required for this amount, but these costs will come out of the discretionary pool of capital dollars because they were never charged against capital spending when paid.  ---------------------- Forwarded by Elaine Concklin/ET&S/Enron on 05/26/2000 11:16 AM ---------------------------   George Fastuca 08/27/99 05:19 PM To: Bill Cordes/ET&S/Enron@Enron cc: Frank Bay/ET&S/Enron@Enron, Steve Gilbert/ET&S/Enron@Enron, Bob Chandler/ET&S/Enron@Enron, Elaine Concklin/ET&S/Enron@Enron   Subject: Applicability of SOP 98-1 to Revenue Management Study Costs  To summarize Bob's note on the business analysis work order, of the $.8MM costs thru July, $.6MM can be capitalized assuming the project goes forward.

"Hi Jim,  To keep you updated on the conference call I sat in with Lindy, Susan, Ramona and Mary Darveaux yesterday afternoon on the TW filing for scheduling Alternate Delivery Points by Price.  Here's a summary of the conversation (sorry, it's windy).  To make a tariff filing for scheduling Alternate Delivery Point by Price, TW will need to file a change to the GT&C definition of Alternate Receipt and Delivery Points.  TW tariff page 51A.  Also, Section 22.2 (tariff page 81B) for the scheduling of Alt. R/D Points will be modified.  Susan is making these changes and will route to Marketing.  TW does not want a process in place during the nomination cycles for ""bidding up, right to match"" if allocation occurs.  They just want a straight scheduled or not scheduled.  Also, TW wants every day, every cycle to have alternates scheduled by price.  However, if a discounted alternate by price gets in on the first cycle, then in cycle 2, another alternate comes in at a higher price than the alternate in cycle 1, the alternate in cycle 2 cannot bump the alternate in cycle 1 if there is not enough capacity to schedule them. The alternate scheduled in cycle 1 is already flowing and considered firm along with the primary firms and cannot be bumped by other alternates or even primary firms for the rest of this gas day.    Since TW has more that one max rate path rate, they would like to have the alternate with the highest absolute value up to max rate (they could be different paths with different max rates).  If there is more than one max rate alternate delivery wanting to be scheduled, they will be considered for scheduling on a pro-rata basis (even if their max rates are different).    TW also has flowing gas priorities for IT within the gas day.  Once IT is scheduled, it can only be bumped in the evening cycle (which is cycle 2, which starts tomorrow at 9:00am) and cycle 4 (also known as Intraday 1, gas flow effective 5:00pm, same day) by any alternate firms requesting to be scheduled.  If the IT is bumped during these two cycles, we actually bill them for 8 hours of flow and then the replacement shipper is billed for the remaining 16 hours of the day.  If an alternate firm requests to be scheduled during the other cycles, they may not bump existing alternates.  This is the way it works today and no changes are proposed to this with the new tariff filing.    Once any Alternate Firm is scheduled, if an allocation becomes necessary, all primary and alternates will be allocated together for this gas day pro-rata.  This is the way it works today and no changes are proposed to this with the new tariff filing.  TW is preparing the tariff changes now.  They are determining how long it will take to make system changes to effect these changes.  Based on that answer, they will make their filing 30-60 days before the time they can actually accommodate the new changes.  I think they are looking at an April or May implementation date.  They feel pretty comfortable that they will get approval for this, even if they get protests.   I will keep you posted if I hear or see anything else on this matter.

"Kim, I know you have been interested in the development of a long term  Natural Gas Model for use in the ETS Revenue Management effort.  I agree that  the ability to model various supply / demand scenarios for North America  should prove useful in ETS business development efforts, and in particular,  in predicting the impact of the new, large Alaskan gas supplies on the N.A.  pipeline grid.  As you know, Vince Kaminski feels that a software product developed by Dale  Nesbitt (MarketPoint, Inc.) of Los Altos Hills, CA. may be a good choice, and  one readily available in a relatively short time.  MarketPoint has proposed  that they work with us in our offices for a week of intensive training and  testing, so we can make a more informed decision before ordering the  software.  They have proposed a charge of $12,000, plus expenses, for the  one-week session, with that cost applied to the first year's subscription  price (approx. $55-60 M/yr) should we decide to go forward.  The other  details (timing, ENE resources required, necessary IT interface, etc) still  need to be worked out, but I believe there is generally a consensus to  proceed with the test.    With my recent relocation to the Clean Fuels group, I will no longer be  responsible for the Alaskan pipeline development.  However, Danny McCarty is  pulling together a team consisting of people from NNG, NBP and elsewhere in  ETS to push the project forward.  I believe Eric Gadd will be playing a key  role as well.  The decision on the long term gas model should appropriately  be made by the new project team.     I have attached a draft of the proposed MarketPoint License agreement.  It  has not yet been fully reviewed by legal (or by Shelley C. for the  ""affiliate"" issues).    Let me know if I can provide any other background or assistance.

Vince/Kim:  I am flying to Houston tonight and wondered if it would fit one or both of your schedules to get together this coming Tuesday sometime for 1/2 hour or so.  I really want to reinitiate the conversations MarketPoint was having with John Goodpasture and you, and he said either or both of you were the right people to continue after his responsibility shift.  John was quite positive about the idea of Enron acquiring MarketPoint NARG through license, and he implied that one or both of you would be carrying the ball in that direction after he handed it to you.  Would this coming Tuesday morning at 930 am be a good time for you guys?  If so, please give me an email shout at the above address or leave a message on my voicemail at (650)218-3069.  I think you will be truly impressed with the scope and progress we have been able to make with both the short run NARG and the long run NARG in which you were interested (not to mention our power model).  The progress is noticeable since you saw it.  Both long and short term NARG are having quite an impact on a number of gas decisions at the moment ranging from Venezuelan LNG, North American LNG import terminals and term, gas basis calculations, trading support, power plant development, gas-to-power price spreads in key markets, veracity of heat rate trades, bank financings, storage field evaluation, and which new pipelines we can expect to see enter and which are dogs.  I really hope we can fit it in and get our discussions moving in a mutually productive direction again.  I think NARG can help you become even more successful, and I look forward to working with you.  We have a new office address and new phone number as well.  (We move in May 1.)

"Kim  Please see EGM Announcement below under the Heading Global Risk Markets. It is here they speak of Contingent Power Price Call Options being done by David Hoog (new Guy it seems).  Talk to you soon  John   -----Original Message----- From:  Enron Announcements/Corp/Enron@ENRON [mailto:IMCEANOTES-Enron+20Announcements_Corp_Enron+40ENRON@ENRON.com]  On Behalf Of Enron Global Markets LLC - Office of the Chairman@ENRON Sent: Tuesday, May  15, 2001 10:52 PM To: Enron Wholesale Services@ENRON Subject: EGM Organization Update & Announcement   The first quarter of 2001 was a record quarter for the performance of the businesses under the Enron Global Markets group.  We posted a gross margin number of $100 million for the first quarter.  This represents a 38% increase in gross margin after a very successful Q1 of 2000.  When combined with outstanding results posted in December of 2000, EGM has contributed over $187 million to the Wholesale group in the last 4 months.  This was due to tremendous contributions from each business group.  In order to keep the momentum going and to facilitate more growth, the following changes and additions have been made within the organization.   Crude and Products group Mid-marketing Bill Berkeland has joined the group and is responsible for creating a focused mid-marketing function specifically within this group.  Fred Lagrasta is responsible for mid-marketing for Enron Americas and still maintains some responsibility for various contacts and deal flow as well.  The purpose of this group is to be very focused in the development of crude and product specific products and services.  This group reports to Randy Maffett.    Origination In order to manage the increased origination opportunities around the world, the Origination group has been changed in order to insure that the proper focus is placed on these opportunities and to manage its wide scope.  Doug Friedman will lead our NGL and Petchem origination efforts reporting to John Nowlan.  Joining Doug will be Rick Cantrell recently hired from Union Carbide.  The global crude and products origination group has added Randy O'Conner from Red Meteor, who has extensive experience in these markets.  Both Randy and Doug Leach's growing fuels origination group will report to Randy Maffett.   Trading Lee Jackson will assume the role of U.S. NGL's lead financial trader, supported by Chad South.  The petchem and plastic trading businesses have been reorganized under Stuart Bland.  Alan Engberg will be responsible for plastics trading in the Americas.    Shipping Scott Moncrieff will assume responsibility of our global shipping network related to crude and products.  Scott will be charged with expanding all aspects of the shipping portfolio taking advantage of our growing presence in these markets and the successes we have had marketing shipping on line.  Weather The weather group under Mark Tawney's direction is expanding its efforts around the world.  Europe will have an expanded focus and the London office will focus on new opportunities in Europe.  Paul Murray has joined Enron from Castlebridge Partners and will be moving to London to develop and expand the continental opportunities.  Ross McIntyre, currently based in London, will report to Paul.  Bill Windle has joined the weather group and has responsibility for origination activities for North America.  Bill's most recent assignment has been in the EBS organization.  The Oslo weather office managed by Thor Lien will have responsibility for Scandinavia weather activities.  In addition, employees are being added in the Australia and Japan regions.  We are now making markets in 32 cities around the world on EnronOnline.    Coal Mark Schroeder has joined the coal group and is responsible for origination activities with generators in the U.S.  Mark's most recent assignment was as the head of all regulatory activities for Enron Europe, Japan and Australia.  Enron Japan The momentum of power deregulation process has slowed in Japan.  The decision has been made to scale back the wholesale power activities.   Joe Hirl, President and CEO of Enron Japan, will now report into the EGM organization.  Joe will maintain his direct responsibility of the office and will be increasing his focus on the business lines within EGM.  All of these products have high growth potential in both the near and long-term and he will coordinate and help implement with all the business lines and their activities.  LNG LNG continues to expand with the vision to increase the number of transactions and create a portfolio of assets and contractual access around the world.  Jonathan Whitehead has joined the LNG group and has responsibility for all trading and shipping activities.  Neal Gerstandt, previously an independent energy consultant,  Jared Kaiser, from Enron Americas - East Gas Desk, and Kurt Lindahl, from Enron Global Assets, have also joined the LNG group with responsibilities in the area of origination in the Western Region.  Enron Freight Markets EFM has concluded over 2,000 transactions in its first two months.  Chris Kravas continues to focus on building the spot trading and mid-market capabilities that will enable it to be the dominant player in its market, and has hired four new traders in the last two weeks.  Kellie Metcalf, from EBS, has joined Shawn Cumberland's origination effort, and Deirdre McCaffrey, from Gas Structuring and Mid-Market, has joined Matt Arnold's forward trading group focusing on diesel products.    Global Risk Markets David Hoog joined Enron from Ace Insurance in December 2000 and has quickly built a team of people specialized in trading unit contingent power price call options, a hybrid insurance derivative product. Drawing on Ace and Enron resources, this team is based in New York and includes Alex Tartakovski and Larry Marcus from Ace, as well as Joana Bekerman and Tony Chang who recently moved to New York from Houston. Their first transaction closed just 3 months after startup.  Brad Blesie will be moving to London in June to establish a base of operation for GRM and expand our insurance derivative activities into the European market place. Among the opportunities he is currently exploring are contingent call options applied to shipping and charter rates, trading insolvent insurance claims, and combining North Sea oil and gas VPP risk with decommissioning insurance.  In April this year, EGM established a hedge fund origination effort in New York reporting to Per Sekse and led by Russell Dyk who recently moved to New York from LNG in Houston. Russell is responsible for expanding our commodity trading relationship with hedge funds to include crude oil, products, liquids and other commodities traded by EGM. Joining Russell in this effort is Stephen Plauche, who comes to us from Enron Americas' power trading desk.  Financial Trading Elsa Piekielniak has assumed responsibility for Enron's developing agriculture business.  Billy Lemmons has changed groups and now runs the Analyst and Associate program for Enron Corp.    Please congratulate everyone on their new assignment and we look forward to the continued growth in all the EGM businesses.",kimberly.watson@enron.com,john.allario@enron.com,EGM Organization Update & Announcement,2001-05-16 17:37:44-07:00,received

"One of the projects suggested by Fac. Planning was a replacement of the coolers at WT-2.  The replacement would get TW an additional 50mm day capacity thru the compressor station.  The coolers that are used now are old and were originally transferred from an NNG Iowa station; they were not built for Texas heat.    Anyway, Ken Chow was the original proponent of this and he has since left Enron.  If you're interested in pursuing, see me and we can get with Ron Matthews or Morgan G. We already ran some cost and economic scenarios.

Below are some of the ideas that we came up with:  As suggested before, we would like to break up the price reporting by giving each individual an area to report.  This could include cash, forward and operational information.  Also, that individual would report on what dynamics they expect to see in the forward market and the impact it would have on NNG.  These areas would be rotated every three months to help each individual learn the various regions.  Vernon, Jeff, John and myself could come up with the format and divide up the areas.    Operations group could report maintenance on the surrounding pipelines that interconnect with NNG. They have alot of contact with the other pipelines and could provide valuable information to the group.  Also, once the pipeline scrapping project is developed further, would it make sense for this group to utilize and compile this information?  Could the TW reporting be expanded to include a marketing person in the meeting that could provide marketing and pricing information?  They could report on the West region and the dynamics that would effect both TW and NNG.  Capacity Release information could become part of the format as needed.  What is on the report that has changed?  How does this year compare to last year?  Was there a large package of capacity that was posted but never transacted?  Do we want to telescope the meeting?  Start out with all groups and then allow certain groups to leave after their presentations?  One individual could be responsible for reporting weather information.

I became aware of this problem a while back when doing pressure profile modeling on the Panhandle lateral when evaluating proposed compression parameters for moving the NNG Gray interconnect to  P-3's suction via a new 1.75 mile pipeline connecting to NNG.  Pipeline hydraulics on the Panhandle line indicated that efficiencies where between 65 and 70% which could usually be indicative of liquids in the line or 2-phase flow.   Walt's comments below provided information that would indicate that the liquid product (C6+) may lean more on the heavier end containing more octane plus components.  Thus, where normally I would split hexane plus into mole fractions of 50% hexane, 30% heptane, and 20% octane; in this case, I used a 50/20/30% split of hexane plus.  Using this split of C6+ in a process model allows a closer approximation of how the gas characteristics will behave at various conditions.  For the purpose of this analysis, the following is considered 1) Agave Red Bluff on-line GC data is used as pipeline quality of gas in Panhandle Lateral because GS report from Owens Corning delivery point is quite similar to Agave GC, 2) gas temperatures will become nearly the same as ground temperatures which is provided on SCADA at P-1 and P2 3) pressure and temperature profiles on the Panhandle lateral at 6/14, 9:00am flowing conditions are listed below   The following graph (attached in MS Word) is a phase envelope using the Agave Red Bluff gas analysis.  By mapping the above relative pressure/temperature points it is clearly observed that pipeline pressure and temperature conditions approach and cross the hydrocarbon dewpoint line indicating that liquids would exist.   The graph clearly shows that as the pressure and temperatures move further into the envelope the more liquids will be produced.  That explains why more liquids are produced by pigging sections between CS P-2 and CS P-3.  Furthermore, using the process model used to generate the phase envelope, the model indicates that gas at 800 psig and 65 degF would exist in both vapor and liquid phases.  Using a flow rate of 100 MMcfd the liquid phase fraction would be approximately 80 Bbls. per day that could amount to approximately 2400 Bbls. per month.  This liquid volume compares closely to some of the recovery volumes reported by Randy and Walt below.     Lets get together on a conference call to further discuss findings and possible solutions.  For a first stab, how about Tuesday, 6/19, at 8:00am(CST)?  Reply with availability and number of ports required.

I have ask Eric Faucheaux to take a look at the system and give us some ideas on where most of the liquid is falling out.  I have talked with (Agave) the producer about this and we're working together to try and figure out what's going on. We can pick up water on our instruments but there's not anything that we know of that will show condensate. This has to be carrying through in the gas because there's not a large amount of liquids at the delivery point. The best solution at this time is to get enough gas to pig the line more often. After getting the liquid in at P-3 we ran a pig from Roswell to P-1 and it came in dry. As soon as the volumes come up we'll run from P-1 to P-2 then into P-3. Thanks for everyone's help in this. If we need a conference call to discuss let me know.  It had been about six weeks between pig runs this time. Total received on the system was about three thousand barrels this time.  The time before this run we received about six thousand barrels.  Thanks  RJ     Randy LeBeau   06/12/2001 04:46 PM   To: Gary Spraggins/ET&S/Enron@ENRON cc: Rich Jolly/ET&S/Enron@ENRON   Subject: Pigging from P-2 to P-3  Gary, we recently had to run a pig from P-2 to P-3 in order to push about 2200 barrels of condensate out of the line.  We had started developing problems with some deliveries off that line.  Apparently, in order to run a pig, some volume has to be routed to that line.   I understand that there are some marketing and gas control issues when we do this, but here are some operational concerns when we have to put this off or postpone it:  The condensate and fluids tend to build up to the point that they carry over to a delivery point with Energas.  This point feeds some domestic customers.  We don't want condensate getting into this point. There is a customer on this line (Owens-Corning) who gets fuel from us.  Their process is very sensitive to pressure and volume changes.  At any given time, I am told that they have about a million dollars worth of material in production.  If they lose fuel, the product is lost and we could be liable.  I am also told that once the plant goes down, it could take a long time (even weeks) to get it back up. The Owens-Corning plant does not have an agreement with anyone for alternate fuel.  When the line has large amounts of condensate, we have been asking Energas to supply the plant until the pig passes the point.  This is in order to prevent a slug of liquid from affecting the fuel pressure.  The gas from Energas is NOT measured.  They used to have the contract, but when we got it, they removed their meter setting.  Apparently they agreed (verbally) to supply gas to the plant in March, for a few hours, when a pig was run.  The plant uses about 3 mmcf/d and Energas was on for about 3 hours.  I was notified today that Energas sent us a bill for the March pig run when we used their gas for fuel.....$21,000!  Obviously we will negotiate that amount, but they have us at a disadvantage.  I can only assume that we will receive a similar bill for using them last weekend for about 3 hours. Everyone feels that if we run a pig on a regular schedule, we would not get large condensate amounts into P-3 (which shuts us down, by the way), we would not have to use Energas, we would not risk pushing condensate into a delivery point, and we would not incur the overtime when this happens.  I'm sure Rich has some concerns also for the portion of the line in his region. We would like to run another pig as soon as possible to see what is left in the line and then (depending on what we push into P-3) get on a regular schedule...possibly once a month. What do you think we can do to work something out? Thanks for any help you can give us.    ---------------------- Forwarded by Eric Faucheaux/ET&S/Enron on 06/14/2001 05:23 PM ---------------------------    WALT WILLIAMS 06/14/2001 09:56 AM To: Randy LeBeau/ET&S/Enron@Enron, Rich Jolly/ET&S/Enron@Enron, Darrell Schoolcraft/ET&S/Enron@Enron, Gary Spraggins/ET&S/Enron@Enron, Eric Faucheaux/ET&S/Enron@Enron, Arnie Bailey/ET&S/Enron@Enron cc: Pampa Pipeline Team/ET&S/Enron@ENRON, Team Pampa/ET&S/Enron@Enron   Subject: Re: Pigging from P-2 to P-3  Just for your information the liquids that we received at P3 is was very hot and high in BTU.

Bottom line this individual had just received word a few minutes before that Commissioner Bilas was writing a Proposed Decision that would ""deny"" PG&E's application. Therefore, PG&E's open season would be closed down. I will follow up next week.  On another important initiative, PG&E's Gas Accord II, apparently PG&E's long awaited application is still hung up with the bankruptcy attorneys. Given their Chapter 11 status, I am sure that their application which includes spending hundreds of millions of dollars for system upgrades requires review and preliminary approval from the bankruptcy attorneys and eventually the judge.

"Bill,   To get hard to find tickets, go to the Plaza Hotel (borders Central Park near FAO Schwartz) entering through the front door, proceed ahead around the big lobby/tea area around to the right and find a woman in a closet sized booth (literally a closet).  Cast members turn tickets over to her to sell that they are given for their shows.  She is completely independent from the hotel and I'm sure she pays huge rent for the tiny space that she has.  They are always wonderful seats to and usually run around $100+ for each ticket.  It is always a worth-it splurge if it is for a play you want to see.  I used to have her card, but it is long gone by now.  You might be able to call the Plaza and inquire as to her name and number and call ahead.  Otherwise, just stop in as soon as you get in town.   Rent is OK, but if this is your first and maybe only trip to NYC for a while, I would certainly recommend seeing other plays first .   I agree with John, your best hotel bet is the Marriott Marquis, which is very nice for a Marriott and the location is the best.   Don't forget to eat lox and a bagel for breakfast!   Keep us posted.

It's been more than 5 years since we've been to NYC, but here's what I'd do...this weekend, look around BR (that's Baton Rouge) for the Sunday issue of the New York Times.  Look in the Lifestyle section (or the NYT equivalent) and you'll undoubtedly see ads for weekend specials and/or package deals to the city, possibly including airfare, hotel, theater tickets, meals, airport transfers, etc.   Other than that, you can check out the Marriott Marquis Hotel, which has its own theater and may offer special weekend rates.  Don't gasp when you find out that a room is going to run you $200/night ++, that's just the going rate for a very expensive city.   You'll need to visit the TKTS booth in Times Square, where folks queue up mid-morning for half-priced same-day tickets to some great shows...and some real dogs.  You won't find any Producers tickets there, unfortunately, but Rent may be available.  See Phantom of the Opera and Les Miserables, for sure.   Grab lunch at the Carnegie Deli, but don't fall on the floor when you order the $18 reuben sandwich.  Pay the $3 split fee and share it with Teri.  Note the huge desserts and the terse wait staff.   See if the Rainbow Room is still open for dinner and dancing.  Kim and I celebrated our 10th anniversary there with Mike & Cheryl Pope (it was Cheryl's 40th BD, too).  The Rainbow Room is in Rockefeller Center (where NBC is located).   Everything is going to be expensive, so get used to it.   Let me know what you decide!   BTW, how's Poppy?

They are located about 10 miles North of Kingman and word is that El Paso had looked into developing these domes several years ago but never did anything but look.  I'm under the impression that the area is still privately owned but I'm not certain.  Anyhow, just thought we would pass this along and if this is something of interest or if you need more information let us know....  Oh yea, Transwesterns pipeline is just South of Kingman, Az.  (approximately 10 to 12 miles from the domes.)    ---------------------- Forwarded by David Roensch/ET&S/Enron on 07/09/2001 09:40 AM --------------------------- From: Kimberly Watson/ENRON@enronXgate on 07/09/2001 11:11 AM CDT To: David Roensch/ET&S/Enron@ENRON cc:    Subject: FW: TW Salt Dome Storage  Tiny,  Now that we are bobbing up for air from Red Rock, I wanted to investigate this a little further.

I was wondering what if any was the status of that evaluation.  Given the increasing number of power plants being installed in the area, this has the potential to reduce expansion costs where we have highly variable loads.

"   Planning has conducted flow studies to determine the capacity of WT-2 system with respect to receiving volume from NNG at Halley interconnect. The limiting factors in determining the capacity of this system were the maximum discharge pressure at WT-2 and the average pressure requirements at Valero-Ward pipeline.  WT-2 is able to discharge at a maximum of 1040 psig pressure and the operating pressure range of Valero pipeline in this area is 975-995 psig. Based on the above conditions WT-2 would be able to deliver only 505 mmcf/d gas to :  Lone-Star Warwink   30 mmcf/d Valero Ward  115 mmcf/d Ovasis   138 mmcf/d Westar-Ward   80  mmcf/d  Valero Pecos   95  mmcf/d Lonestar Pecos   47  mmcf/d Total   505 mmcf/d  This flow model indicates that ( assuming main line valve-208 B is closed) WT-2 would be able to receive up to 100 mmcf/d from NNG at Halley interconnect. The remaining gas supply behind Wt-2 would flow from NGPL-Winkler, EOG, Keystone/ Sid Richardson, Monument and WT-1.  Based on the data obtained from our TW-Firm Data Book the existing committed volume at WT-2 for next five months are:    Aug-01 Sep-01 Oct-01 Nov-01 Dec-01    Comitted volume  582   582 582  565 545 ( mmcf/d)             505 mmcf/d capacity:        *** Less USGT at  77 77 77 60 40      WT-2            ***. Option-1: 12 mmcf/d could be handle at WT-1 on Aug-01, 21 mmcf/d on Sep-01, 7 mmcf/d                         on Oct-01 and the rest through Texas Panhandle Lateral.

It was implemented on April 27, 2000. Socal began sending us the window volume via EDI at this time. Prior to this date, they faxed it to TW and the reps. would load that volume into the capacity system for the Socal point. Linda Ward thinks that we have the old fax documents saved in the file room.  Mary and I also called the EDI Hub team to find out how far back they store our EDI files. Currently the EDI Hub keep six months of data then the archive it. We could get to that date if needed. They would be a charge involved to pull archived data.  Wayne on the TMS team will also check to see if this information is replicated to adhoc (meaning we keep a complete history), or if it is not replicated (meaning we only keeps six months of data).  Please let me know if you need any other information.  Thanks Ramona ",lindy.donoho@enron.com,kimberly.watson@enron.com,FW:  Update from the Socal Meeting,2001-07-27 09:32:50-07:00,sent

" Kim,  Thank you for your time on Wednesday. I enjoyed meeting you and appreciated the discussion regarding pipeline economics.  I was thinking about the capacity you sold in 2003 on an Index to Index basis. On the attached diagram, the boxes colored black represent my understanding of your current position (you are locked-in to $1.00/MMBtu for the Calif. Border Index minus San Juan Index but exposed to San Juan Basin gas prices for the fuel required to deliver 20,000 MMBtu/d to the Calif. Border). You can easily lock-in your cost of fuel gas as shown by the swap colored in red. I believe that you did this capacity trade when gas prices were higher, therefore you could fix your fuel cost at today's lower prices and earn a higher margin on your capacity sale than originally expected.   The decision to unwind the Index to Index hedge that you did with ENA is a tougher call. The unwind would be accomplished by the swap colored blue. Which do you prefer: 1. $1.00/MMBtu or 2. $0.40 + (Calif. Border minus San Juan Indices) per MMBtu ? Unwinding at $0.60/MMBtu, you must believe that Calif. Border Index minus San Juan Index will be greater than $0.60/MMBtu. I am not very familar with those pricing points so I can not give an educated opinion.  Anyway, I hope that this is useful.

"I just got this and thought you might find it interesting as well.  Amy    --------- Inline attachment follows ---------  From:  <Eric@EHirst.com> To: Eric@EHirst.com Date: Wednesday, August 1, 2001 12:16:55 GMT Subject:   Dear Colleague,  The Edison Electric Institute just published a paper, The California Electricity Crisis: Lessons for Other States, which I wrote. The paper is available on the Publications page of my website, www.EHirst.com <http://www.ehirst.com/> . Please let me know if you have any comments on the paper.  Here is a summary of the paper:          California was supposed to show the rest of the nation a brighter electricity future. That future, as outlined by the California Public Utilities Commission in 1994, envisioned an electricity industry featuring competitive markets. Such markets were intended to produce lower costs and more choices for consumers, while ensuring profits for efficient energy suppliers and encouraging the retirement of old, inefficient power plants.          Although the first two years of restructuring (beginning in April 1998) seemed to bear out these promises, the last year has been a disaster for California's electricity consumers, taxpayers, and electric utilities. Part of the fallout from California's electricity crisis is considerable concern-even opposition-in other states to restructuring the electricity industry.           Although a few states have decided, based on the California experience, not to restructure, I believe that is the wrong outcome. Instead, the primary lessons other states should learn from California are that competitive markets can work; competition is not to blame for California's problems; and basic economic principles of supply, demand, and prices affect market outcomes.          Section 2 of this paper briefly reviews the history of electricity regulation and restructuring in California and the problems that occurred beginning in May 2000. Section 3, the heart of this paper, offers guidance to other states on the key ingredients of a competitive electricity industry. This section makes several points:   * Maintain a favorable investment and regulatory climate for new generation to ensure that enough generation capacity is online and planned to meet growing loads.   * Ensure that enough infrastructure (transmission capacity and natural gas pipeline capacity) is in place and planned to meet growing loads, maintain reliability, connect new generators to the grid, support large regional markets, and provide fuel to power plants.   * Encourage retail customers to participate in dynamic-pricing and voluntary-load-reduction programs (i.e., couple retail and wholesale markets).   * Create honest retail competition: avoid standard-offer rates with artificial discounts and create conditions that encourage many companies to offer retail services without favoring individual competitors.   * Encourage electricity suppliers to manage and diversify their supply and price risks.   * Create efficient and integrated wholesale markets for energy, ancillary services, and transmission congestion.   * Monitor and minimize horizontal market power (generation) and vertical market power (combined ownership and operation of generation and transmission).            Ultimately, competitive markets for electricity will lower costs and prices, better align consumer prices with producer costs, improve producer efficiency in both investment and operation, maintain or improve reliability, and yield greater innovation in customer services and pricing options.           But, this transition from one industry structure to another is turning out to be long and complicated. It is complicated because electricity is so important to our modern, high-tech society; electricity is our most flexible fuel, providing light, heat, motive power, and the energy to operate all our electronic equipment. Also, electricity truly is a real-time product for which production and consumption must occur at the same time.           Although the problems that have occurred in California are substantial and worrisome, regulators and legislators in other states should focus on the long-term benefits of competitive electricity markets and accept the possible short-term problems that may occur. They also need to recognize that wholesale markets are regional in scope and extend far beyond the boundaries of any single state. Finally, competition in retail and wholesale markets must be coordinated; in particular, it is not possible to have competitive wholesale markets unless at least some retail load faces time varying prices.           If states restructure properly to create competitive markets for wholesale energy and retail services, we should all benefit. Consumers will enjoy lower prices, they will have many more choices of energy services and price-risk tradeoffs, reliability will be improved because most reliability services will be obtained through markets instead of by engineering edict, and the financial risks associated with building and operating power plants will be assigned properly to investors rather than consumers.

"Ramona,  Gosh, something always seems to come up every year that we want to make a change to our existing systems.  Lindy will be back tomorrow and I will discuss this with her.  We are evaluating how we currently administer and market pools.  If we decide to make a change I suspect that it may require a system change, but it is too early to make a decision just yet. I also think that we should think about how to link EOL transactions through the entire contracting process.  I know that NNG is probably a little further on this than we are, but it is reasonable to think we should have this ready for us next year.    I will continue to ponder this and discuss this with Lindy upon her return tomorrow.

I think capital has to go to Rod Hayslett around the following week in August.  As you know, it can take several days to work with Denis so if we have discretionary projects those need to get moving quickly.  We also need to look at GISB and FERC and see if we have anything next year which is non-discretionary.  The Rates & Revenue System is well underway and in good shape, but we don't have much time to pull together remaining projects.

"Kim, Here is the WSCC report from ENA on status of new generation facilities. The status on EAMR is that I am in the process of finalizing the writeup on power plant services that I promised you a copy of. We have been working very closely with John Dushinske's group on 3 new projects off of NNG where EAMR would potentially build or provide services for new laterals to new power plants.  The projects are Lincoln Electric System (6.5 miles), Omaha Public Power (<1 mile) and Mid American (12 miles). On LES, the customer went out with an RFP for the design, ROW and construction management only.  On OPP, Chuck Wilkinson is his proposal to the customer gave 3 options: 1) NNG builds and owns with customer paying overheads and tax gross up, 2) NNG rolls project into rates (cost still includes overheads but no tax gross up) and 3) customer owns and EAMR builds and possibly operates facility.  The proposal for OPP is similar to MidAm.  We have found that options 1) and 2) are fast and easy because Level A cost estimates can be used, however, for option 3, a much more detailed bid is required which is sort of like a Level B+ estimate, which is more detailed than normal Level B estimates.  We are working through the process and various issues for option 3.  To get definitive bids for option 3, a 30 to 45 day lead time is required. This ground work for NNG will come in handy on TW projects.   -----Original Message----- From:  Oh, Jeffrey   Sent: Wednesday, August 01, 2001 12:28 PM To: Allen, Phillip K.; Alonso, Tom; Badeer, Robert; Belden, Tim; Bruce, James; Bryson, Jesse; Buerkle, Jim; Calger, Christopher F.; Choi, Paul; Clark, Ed; Comnes, Alan; Davidson, Debra; Donovan, Terry W.; Driscoll, Michael M.; Dyer, Laird; Etringer, Michael; Fillinger, Mark; Fuller, Dave; Gilbert, Jim; Gomez, Julie A.; Holst, Keith; Lackey, Chris; Mainzer, Elliot; Malowney, John; Mcdonald, Michael; Mckay, Jonathan; Motley, Matt; Mumm, Chris; Page, Jonalan; Parquet, David; Perry, Todd; Polsky, Phil; Richter, Jeff; Rosman, Stewart; Sarnowski, Julie; Scholtes, Diana; Shields, Jeff; Slaughter, Jeff G.; Smith, Sarabeth; Surowiec, Glenn; Swain, Steve; Swerzbin, Mike; Thomas, Jake; Thome, Stephen; Van Gelder, John; Ward, Kim S (Houston); Wente, Laura; Williams III, Bill; Zufferli, John Subject: New Geneneration Report for July 2001  NOTE:  The current report has one major change .

As part of the permanent solution, the EDI process will need to be modied when the website is modified.  I would like to review messages that are sent in TW EDI files for unsubscribed capacity and operationally available capacity.   TW currently sends a text message with each of the EDI unsubscribed capacity files that are sent to customers.  This message is:   Capacity at these points is subject to the capacity available on the relevant path for the receipt and delivery point combination(s) requested. (2)  Please contact your Marketing Representative for information concerning point with capacity less than 5,000 Mcf/day. (3)  Transwestern is willing to consider expressions of interest concerning available capacity or requests for capacity.

For operationally available capacity, TW currently sends the following text message with each EDI operationally available file:   The below listed capacity is an estimate of the unutilized capacity that will be available on the effective date above, until further notice is posted.  The capacity is only an estimate and is subject to change without notice due to the transient nature of pipeline operations.  There are no guarantees expressed or implied that this capacity will be available.

Since the daily numbers will be the same as the monthly numbers for August through October, we will post the monthly numbers published through the new TW unsubscribed capacity system as if they were daily numbers.  The posting will be for two days in advance.  (i.e. on August 1, we will post numbers for August 3).  Since these will be the same numbers used by EDI, TW's unsubscribed capacity EDI will not need to change at this time.  To do this, TW's new unsubscribed capacity posting must be in production by the 10th.  We will do our best to be ready for testing the daily posting by Monday,  August 5.

As part of the permanent solution, the EDI process will need to be modied when the website is modified.  I would like to review messages that are sent in TW EDI files for unsubscribed capacity and operationally available capacity.   TW currently sends a text message with each of the EDI unsubscribed capacity files that are sent to customers.  This message is:   Capacity at these points is subject to the capacity available on the relevant path for the receipt and delivery point combination(s) requested. (2)  Please contact your Marketing Representative for information concerning point with capacity less than 5,000 Mcf/day. (3)  Transwestern is willing to consider expressions of interest concerning available capacity or requests for capacity.  Shipper interested in available capacity may either contact their Marketing Representative or submit a request for service to Transwestern Transportation Marketing, P.O.Box 1188, Houston, Texas 77251-1199 or by facsimile to (713)646-8000.  For operationally available capacity, TW currently sends the following text message with each EDI operationally available file:   The below listed capacity is an estimate of the unutilized capacity that will be available on the effective date above, until further notice is posted.  The capacity is only an estimate and is subject to change without notice due to the transient nature of pipeline operations.  There are no guarantees expressed or implied that this capacity will be available.  Formal nominations to the pipeline will be processed in accordance witht he company's tariff provisions for scheduling of all available capacity.

These are:   b.  the terms and effective date of the contract  h.  the rate charged in $$/MMbtu  Rick - Currently, the effective or execution date is not captured anywhere.  I will need someone (on of the Alma's or Josh) to extract all TW contracts and populate this info onto a spreadsheed.  Prospectively, this info will also need to be captured with each new contract.    Kim - With regard to the rate charged, I am concerned with how the information will be captured and stored.  It's virtually impossible to use the current CBS rate system because at the end of the month, there is a great possibility that these FT rates to the Cal border will be buried into a calculated, blended rate (due to capturing incremental fees for alternate point usage).  Also as I mentioned in a previous e-mail to TK, we need to ensure that the IT rates are updated in the rate system promptly.  Don - After your initial review of the data request, did you have any other concerns regarding data retrieval and automation of the process?

The information will be submitted 30 days after the close of a month -- meaning that our first report will be due September 30.  The order does not specify when the historical capacity information for May 1999 and May 2000 needs to be submitted -- so at this point I'm assuming that it will submitted with the first report.  I would like to have a brief get-together tomorrow at 10:30 AM (Ricki will follow with details) just to make certain that we head into the month collecting all the information we need to be compliant.  In particular, now that we will have to report nominated vs. scheduled to the Cal. border each day -- I have an even heightened concern that we head into the month making sure that we capture the SoCal Window number each day.

Since the daily numbers will be the same as the monthly numbers for August through October, we will post the monthly numbers published through the new TW unsubscribed capacity system as if they were daily numbers.  The posting will be for two days in advance.  (i.e. on August 1, we will post numbers for August 3).  Since these will be the same numbers used by EDI, TW's unsubscribed capacity EDI will not need to change at this time.  To do this, TW's new unsubscribed capacity posting must be in production by the 10th.  We will do our best to be ready for testing the daily posting by Monday,  August 5. (Jeanne & Patty - is August 6th doable for testing and August 10th doable for production?)   This is only a temporary solution until further analysis can be done to design the correct solution.

Amy    --------- Inline attachment follows ---------  From:  <Eric@EHirst.com> To: Eric@EHirst.com Date: Wednesday, August 1, 2001 12:16:55 GMT Subject:   Dear Colleague,  The Edison Electric Institute just published a paper, The California Electricity Crisis: Lessons for Other States, which I wrote. The paper is available on the Publications page of my website, www.EHirst.com <http://www.ehirst.com/> . Please let me know if you have any comments on the paper.  Here is a summary of the paper:          California was supposed to show the rest of the nation a brighter electricity future. That future, as outlined by the California Public Utilities Commission in 1994, envisioned an electricity industry featuring competitive markets. Such markets were intended to produce lower costs and more choices for consumers, while ensuring profits for efficient energy suppliers and encouraging the retirement of old, inefficient power plants.          Although the first two years of restructuring (beginning in April 1998) seemed to bear out these promises, the last year has been a disaster for California's electricity consumers, taxpayers, and electric utilities. Part of the fallout from California's electricity crisis is considerable concern-even opposition-in other states to restructuring the electricity industry.           Although a few states have decided, based on the California experience, not to restructure, I believe that is the wrong outcome. Instead, the primary lessons other states should learn from California are that competitive markets can work; competition is not to blame for California's problems; and basic economic principles of supply, demand, and prices affect market outcomes.          Section 2 of this paper briefly reviews the history of electricity regulation and restructuring in California and the problems that occurred beginning in May 2000. Section 3, the heart of this paper, offers guidance to other states on the key ingredients of a competitive electricity industry. This section makes several points:   * Maintain a favorable investment and regulatory climate for new generation to ensure that enough generation capacity is online and planned to meet growing loads.   * Ensure that enough infrastructure (transmission capacity and natural gas pipeline capacity) is in place and planned to meet growing loads, maintain reliability, connect new generators to the grid, support large regional markets, and provide fuel to power plants.   * Encourage retail customers to participate in dynamic-pricing and voluntary-load-reduction programs (i.e., couple retail and wholesale markets).   * Create honest retail competition: avoid standard-offer rates with artificial discounts and create conditions that encourage many companies to offer retail services without favoring individual competitors.   * Encourage electricity suppliers to manage and diversify their supply and price risks.   * Create efficient and integrated wholesale markets for energy, ancillary services, and transmission congestion.   * Monitor and minimize horizontal market power (generation) and vertical market power (combined ownership and operation of generation and transmission).            Ultimately, competitive markets for electricity will lower costs and prices, better align consumer prices with producer costs, improve producer efficiency in both investment and operation, maintain or improve reliability, and yield greater innovation in customer services and pricing options.           But, this transition from one industry structure to another is turning out to be long and complicated. It is complicated because electricity is so important to our modern, high-tech society; electricity is our most flexible fuel, providing light, heat, motive power, and the energy to operate all our electronic equipment. Also, electricity truly is a real-time product for which production and consumption must occur at the same time.           Although the problems that have occurred in California are substantial and worrisome, regulators and legislators in other states should focus on the long-term benefits of competitive electricity markets and accept the possible short-term problems that may occur. They also need to recognize that wholesale markets are regional in scope and extend far beyond the boundaries of any single state. Finally, competition in retail and wholesale markets must be coordinated; in particular, it is not possible to have competitive wholesale markets unless at least some retail load faces time varying prices.           If states restructure properly to create competitive markets for wholesale energy and retail services, we should all benefit. Consumers will enjoy lower prices, they will have many more choices of energy services and price-risk tradeoffs, reliability will be improved because most reliability services will be obtained through markets instead of by engineering edict, and the financial risks associated with building and operating power plants will be assigned properly to investors rather than consumers.

"Glen,  Can you help interpret this impact of this decision on California customers for us?  Since we are looking at the Southern Trails system again, is this really good for them?  Exactly what is the rate the peaking customer would be charged?  Many thanks, Kim.   -----Original Message----- From:  Brennan, Lorna   Sent: Friday, August 03, 2001 9:45 AM To: Chavez, Gabriel; Dowd, Stephen; Gadd, Eric; Hyatt, Kevin; Millar, John; Ratner, Michael; Taylor, Gina; Hass, Glen; Loeffler, Michael; Stanton, Lon; Wilson, Rob; Harris, Steven; Donoho, Lindy; Goradia, Pallavi; Lindberg, Lorraine; Lohman, TK; Lokay, Michelle; Moore, Jan; Watson, Kimberly; Huber, Lee; Pryor, Tony Subject: Article on SoCal ""Peaking"" Rate  New Peaking Rate for SoCalGas Could Spur Bypass  After various fits and starts surrounding the issue over a number of months, California regulators Thursday established an alternative demand stand-by charge, called a ""peaking rate,"" for Southern California Gas Co., which could open up the utility to ""economic bypass"" by interstate pipeline projects lined up and ready to go at the border. The California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) rejected the utility's own proposal as ""anti-competitive.""  ""This case has been very contentious,"" said the lead commissioner assigned to the case, Richard Bilas. ""For the most part, the response to SoCal's application was negative."" Noting active opposition from large end-users, merchant generators and interstate pipelines, Bilas said that it is difficult to find an ideal peaking rate for gas. CPUC President Loretta Lynch dropped an alternate proposal to support Bilas.  Ideally, the regulators are trying to keep the utility and its captive customers whole, while not deterring the option of what they call ""economic bypass,"" said Bilas, noting that SoCalGas' proposals did not ""reflect market reality. The new rate calculation is very complex, and potential competitors have yet to comment on its impact.  A number of proposed interstate pipelines are lined up at the border awaiting a decision which would make it economic for them to proceed into SoCalGas territory, including an expansion of Mojave to Sacramento, Questar Corp.'s proposed Southern Trails oil-to-natural gas converted pipeline from the Four Corners area to Long Beach, and Kinder Morgan and Calpine's Sonoran pipe to San Francisco. Up to this point the utility's residual load service (RLS) charges -- which customers of other pipelines had to pay in addition to charges paid to the transporting pipelines -- made it uneconomic to sign up on other lines. Called on by the CPUC to come in with a more moderate system, SoCalGas had proposed replacing the RLS charge with a peaking charge that customers said was just as onerous.  The CPUC made its decision on a revised peaking charge unanimously on a 4-0 vote, with one of the five-member body's commissioners absent.  The CPUC action establishes a peaking rate for SoCalGas customers who want to take only partial service from the utility and get their baseload service from another pipeline. Customers will be required to pay a monthly demand charge, public goods charge collected on a volumetric basis (so if there is no use, there is no charge), a reservation charge with a complex formula, and an interruptible peaking rate for volumes actually received.  Peaking customers will be subject to daily balancing and a credit for service interruptions of firm capacity, which will apply to both new and existing facilities.  ""The new rate contrasts to the rate design in place for SoCalGas' standard full-requirements firm-load customers who pay for priority on a volumetric basis,"" Lynch said. ""We're changing the peaking rates so that customers not taking their full service from the utility will only pay for the amount of capacity they use on any given day.  ""The challenge for the CPUC in this case was to establish a peaking tariff for natural gas service that fairly compensates SoCalGas for standing ready to serve the peak needs only of some customers, while those customers go off its system for their baseload needs, but also to develop a tariff that allows SoCalGas to be able to compete with some of the energy company pipelines that plan to enter into SoCal's service territory.  ""We're trying to encourage and promote additional natural gas resources without encouraging cherry picking or overbuilding for which core customers would end up paying for,"" Lynch added.

Kim.  -----Original Message----- From: Gold, Amy [mailto:AGold@coral-energy.com] Sent: Wednesday, August 01, 2001 11:25 AM To: Watson, Kimberly Subject: FW: New Report on Lessons from California   I just got this and thought you might find it interesting as well.  Amy    --------- Inline attachment follows ---------  From:  <Eric@EHirst.com> To: Eric@EHirst.com Date: Wednesday, August 1, 2001 12:16:55 GMT Subject:   Dear Colleague,  The Edison Electric Institute just published a paper, The California Electricity Crisis: Lessons for Other States, which I wrote. The paper is available on the Publications page of my website, www.EHirst.com <http://www.ehirst.com/> . Please let me know if you have any comments on the paper.  Here is a summary of the paper:          California was supposed to show the rest of the nation a brighter electricity future. That future, as outlined by the California Public Utilities Commission in 1994, envisioned an electricity industry featuring competitive markets. Such markets were intended to produce lower costs and more choices for consumers, while ensuring profits for efficient energy suppliers and encouraging the retirement of old, inefficient power plants.          Although the first two years of restructuring (beginning in April 1998) seemed to bear out these promises, the last year has been a disaster for California's electricity consumers, taxpayers, and electric utilities. Part of the fallout from California's electricity crisis is considerable concern-even opposition-in other states to restructuring the electricity industry.           Although a few states have decided, based on the California experience, not to restructure, I believe that is the wrong outcome. Instead, the primary lessons other states should learn from California are that competitive markets can work; competition is not to blame for California's problems; and basic economic principles of supply, demand, and prices affect market outcomes.          Section 2 of this paper briefly reviews the history of electricity regulation and restructuring in California and the problems that occurred beginning in May 2000. Section 3, the heart of this paper, offers guidance to other states on the key ingredients of a competitive electricity industry. This section makes several points:   * Maintain a favorable investment and regulatory climate for new generation to ensure that enough generation capacity is online and planned to meet growing loads.   * Ensure that enough infrastructure (transmission capacity and natural gas pipeline capacity) is in place and planned to meet growing loads, maintain reliability, connect new generators to the grid, support large regional markets, and provide fuel to power plants.   * Encourage retail customers to participate in dynamic-pricing and voluntary-load-reduction programs (i.e., couple retail and wholesale markets).   * Create honest retail competition: avoid standard-offer rates with artificial discounts and create conditions that encourage many companies to offer retail services without favoring individual competitors.   * Encourage electricity suppliers to manage and diversify their supply and price risks.   * Create efficient and integrated wholesale markets for energy, ancillary services, and transmission congestion.   * Monitor and minimize horizontal market power (generation) and vertical market power (combined ownership and operation of generation and transmission).            Ultimately, competitive markets for electricity will lower costs and prices, better align consumer prices with producer costs, improve producer efficiency in both investment and operation, maintain or improve reliability, and yield greater innovation in customer services and pricing options.           But, this transition from one industry structure to another is turning out to be long and complicated. It is complicated because electricity is so important to our modern, high-tech society; electricity is our most flexible fuel, providing light, heat, motive power, and the energy to operate all our electronic equipment. Also, electricity truly is a real-time product for which production and consumption must occur at the same time.           Although the problems that have occurred in California are substantial and worrisome, regulators and legislators in other states should focus on the long-term benefits of competitive electricity markets and accept the possible short-term problems that may occur. They also need to recognize that wholesale markets are regional in scope and extend far beyond the boundaries of any single state. Finally, competition in retail and wholesale markets must be coordinated; in particular, it is not possible to have competitive wholesale markets unless at least some retail load faces time varying prices.           If states restructure properly to create competitive markets for wholesale energy and retail services, we should all benefit. Consumers will enjoy lower prices, they will have many more choices of energy services and price-risk tradeoffs, reliability will be improved because most reliability services will be obtained through markets instead of by engineering edict, and the financial risks associated with building and operating power plants will be assigned properly to investors rather than consumers.

Amoco Florida - BP has requested TW consider increasing the meter at the Amoco Florida Plant.  Currently, it is sized for receipts of 165,000 MMBtu/d and BP is interested in doubling the size of the interconnect.  I am waiting on a Facility Planner.  Red Rock filing - a filing was made on 7/31 to FERC requesting approval to utilize an incremental 5 acres at each station for construction purposes.  A Director's Letter must be received because of this change in our construction procedures and is expected to be issued by FERC within 2 to 3 weeks.  NGPL Eddy - I have received Facility Planning's preliminary comments on the Interconnect Agreement and am still awaiting Legal's comments in order to return TW's comments to NGPL.    Energy Development Group - I have attempted to continue to try to work with EDG to locate TW's pipe in specific locations in AZ and NM in order for them to better site power plants off TW.  This week there have been no Facility Planners to help me with this and I have a call into Tiny for assistance.

"Thanks for thinking of sending this to me as I always appreciate any California regulatory data.  This report came out in May and is known as the CEC's ""White Paper"" on the CA Natural Gas Infrastructure.  After Com. Woods appointment at FERC, the CEC made sure he was aware of their paper and forwarded it to FERC.  The primary thrust of the paper is in line with our position that SoCal and PG&E need to expand their take-away capacity at the border.  Interestingly the FERC issued a similar finding after the Technical Conference on the same subject was held in Wash. DC. I don't expect the CEC to do much of anything with the paper beyond the press they got for identifying one of the causes for the price spike and a shortage of gas into the state.

Cc: Ratner, Michael Subject: Southern Trails Article on Western Leg  Questar Can't Sell from Proposed Pipeline Under New CA Rate  Although not giving up its search for customers in California, Salt Lake City-based Questar Corp.'s oil-to-natural-gas converted pipeline from the Four Corners of New Mexico remains stymied in operating its portion within California under a newly revised ""peaking tariff"" for Southern California Gas Co., according to Questar officials who have been analyzing the new rate established Aug. 2 by state regulators.  Questar is looking at alternative uses for the California portion of the approved interstate pipeline.  ""We can't work with (the rate) as it is,"" said Chad Jones, a Questar spokesperson. ""It definitely doesn't go far enough to remove the obstacles in the way of developing new pipelines in Southern California. It still doesn't level the playing field. Although it is better than the current RLS (residual load service) tariff; it still punishes customers who want to take partial service from a SoCalGas competitor.  ""Customers still have to pay higher interruptible penalties than in other parts of the state, and higher rates for balancing services. We're at the point where we're not going to stop trying to market capacity on Southern Trails, but we're definitely at the point where we have to consider some alternative uses for the California portion (of the 700-miles, 16-inch-diameter pipeline).""  One of the alternatives would be to operate the California part of the line as a petroleum or liquids line carrying product from the Long Beach Harbor area to existing petroleum or liquid products pipelines in and around the California-Arizona border. That's the alternative, however, Jones said, but finding a customer for a major portion of the converted pipeline's 120 MMcf/d capacity is still Questar's preference.  After months of reviewing the issue and weighing alternatives, the California Public Utilities Commission last week established a new ""peaking"" or standby charge for customers taking partial service from a SoCalGas competitor, allowing those customers to pay only for the amounts of gas they use at any given time from the local gas transmission and distribution utility, SoCalGas.  The CPUC tried to balance the need for the local gas utility to be made whole so added fixed costs did not have to be shifted to other customers, while trying to ""encourage and promote additional natural gas resources without encouraging cherry-picking or overbuilding,"" according to CPUC President Loretta Lynch.  Questar officials said Tuesday they have pretty much exhausted their appeal resources, and they are ""not about to go head-to-head with the established big boys"" in lobbying California's governor or state legislature, Jones said. ""Thus, we're still looking for a large customer who would be willing to break the gridlock in Southern California in the name of promoting competition.""  The east-of-California portion of the Southern Trails pipeline is already fully subscribed and will start operations mid-year next year, Jones said.

Regent will own 75% of the project, while MEVCO will own the remaining 25%. The estimated cost of the project comes in at $250 million.

"Per our phone conversation this morning.....  I know you are well aware of these happenings (Southern Trails disappointing CPUC decision and the KMI Sonoran pipeline to California) but I thought these two articles were timely.  Since it sounds like the Southern Trails gas is getting stranded wouldn't it be great if we could give KMI some competion for the new Power Plant being proposed in the four corners area.  Southern Trails might be willing to offload some of the system cheap following the outcome of the CPUC decision.  You may or may not be aware, but TW was working with D. Hawkins at providing operating services of this Souther Trails system for Questar so we have pretty good info. on the Questar system (or Don does I would guess). Anyhow, I know the Southern Trails system has to be in close proximity to this proposed power plant.   (If I am driving you nuts with this junk mail Kim, please let me know.)     Southern Trails Disappointed by CPUC Decision; Decision Discourages Development of New Natural Gas Pipeline Capacity   SALT LAKE CITY, Aug. 8 /PRNewswire/ -- Officials from Questar Southern Trails Pipeline Co. today expressed disappointment with the California Public Utility Commission's (CPUC) Aug. 2, 2001, ruling on Southern California Gas Company's (SoCal Gas) Residual Load Service (RLS) tariff.  ""The CPUC's proposed new peaking rate, while an improvement over SoCal's current RLS tariff, still does not level the playing field,"" said D.N. Rose, Southern Trails president and CEO.  ""It punishes customers who want to take partial service from a SoCal competitor, and it will discourage the development of new pipelines inside California.""  Under the CPUC's proposed new peaking rate, new gas-fired power plants wanting natural gas service from both SoCal Gas and a new competing pipeline will pay a higher rate for SoCal's service than captive customers taking service entirely from SoCal.  In addition, new power plants would be subject to more restrictive balancing services than captive customers and would pay even more for interruptible service than California power plants in other parts of the state.  Rose noted the previous RLS tariff was so punitive that not a single customer has taken service from a competing pipeline since the RLS was enacted in 1995.  The new SoCal peaking rate, while not as onerous as the RLS tariff, will likely preserve SoCal's monopoly in Southern California.  ""The CPUC's peaking rate is anti-competitive,"" Rose said.  ""Neither PG&E (Pacific Gas & Electric) nor any interstate pipeline enjoys such protection from competition.""  Questar is seeking entry into the California market with its Southern Trails Pipeline project, which could deliver 120 million cubic feet of natural gas daily to Southern California.  Questar purchased the former crude-oil pipeline in November 1998.  The existing 16-inch-diameter pipeline runs about 700 miles from New Mexico, through Arizona, and into California, traveling through San Bernardino, Riverside, Orange, and Los Angeles counties to Long Beach.  The project received both federal and state certification last year and has completed extensive environmental reviews.  The eastern zone of the Southern Trails Pipeline, which extends from the Four Corners area to the California state line, is fully contracted.  Questar expects to have it in service by mid-2002.  Rose indicated that the future of the California section of Southern Trails is uncertain.  While not abandoning efforts to put the pipeline into natural gas service, the company will be forced by the unfavorable CPUC decision to consider alternative uses for the California portion, including possible conversion to transport crude oil or other liquid petroleum products.  Questar Southern Trails is a subsidiary of Questar Corp. (NYSE: <A HREF=""aol://4785:STR"">STR</A>), a $2.5 billion diversified natural gas company headquartered in Salt Lake City. Through subsidiaries, Questar transports natural gas through a 2,000-mile system in Utah, Colorado, New Mexico and Wyoming.  The company also serves as the primary natural gas distributor in Utah, offering services similar to those offered by SoCal Gas and PG&E in California.   Regent Energy Corporation and Millennium Energy Ventures Sign Power Generation Accord for 500 MW Plant Estimated at $250 Million Capital Cost   HOUSTON, Aug. 9 /PRNewswire/ -- Regent Energy Corporation (OTC Bulletin Board: RGEY) (""Regent"") today executed a contract with Millennium Energy Ventures (""MEVCO""), a private Houston-based venture capital and project development company (www.mevco.com ), to develop an electric plant with 500 MW generating capacity (estimated cost $250 million) on Regent's Horseshoe Gallup lease in San Juan County, New Mexico.  Ownership of the project is 75% Regent and 25% MEVCO.  Under the agreement, MEVCO will manage the permitting estimated at 6 to 9 months, and construction process, arranging the equity as needed for same. Regent will be prepared to give up 50% (total) of its 75% net for the financing, netting a 25% interest following the equity/debt financing.  Further terms of the agreement provide that MEVCO will assist Regent in the acquisition of several gas fields in the Four Corners area, San Juan and Rio Ariba Counties of New Mexico, totaling an estimated 90+ Bcf and 20 MMcfpd current production.  This production will be sufficient to power 100 MW of the power plant, with the remaining supply to be aggregated from other San Juan producers.  Phillip Gennarelli, Managing Director of MEVCO said, ""We are pleased to be involved in this project with Regent.  The addition of more producing properties in the area that we bring Regent, coupled with Regent's Horseshoe Gallup holdings, which are in direct proximity with the existing Four Corners Power Plant and the route of the recently announced Sonoran Pipeline venture of Calpine and Kinder Morgan, will provide an unequaled opportunity for both companies.""  John Ehrman, President of Regent commented, ""The additional production from producing properties which MEVCO is assisting Regent in purchasing, currently producing some $1.5 million per month in net operating income, coupled with the additional income through power generation helps Regent to maximize the location of our holdings in relation to the proximity of the existing power plant and transmission lines to key electricity markets in Los Angeles and other western markets.  It is a good use of our surface lease, not related to the current proved mineral reserves of the lease.""  The producing oil and properties which MEVCO is assisting Regent in purchasing are in Regent's core area of the Four Corners region near Farmington, New Mexico.  Regent will be required to finance the acquisition of the oil and gas proven producing properties under consideration.  Recently, Regent announced that it was in the process of purchasing the interests of all remaining working interest owners in the field, a transaction expected to be consummated by the end of the third quarter 2001, giving Regent 100% ownership of the current minerals on the lease.

"Kim:   I worked up some numbers with more direct application to Cal 02 for your meeting tomorrow. LP    Market View: Still count long term trend as down, with at least one more new low still ahead.  Issue is whether this low will be a marginal new low or open the gate for major new lows.      Market Structure on Prompt Continuation:  4.581 If prices close > 4.581 without first breaking < 2.881, then long term trend shifts from bottoming to up.  3.350 If prices trade > 3.350 or close > 3.320, bearish case for new lows is greatly minimized, and long term trend shifts from down to bottoming. 3.320  3.085 Current prompt price.  2.615 Minimum downside target.  2.364   1.915 Most bearish scenario.    Market Structure Application to Cal 02 Strip (Non-Basis Adjusted):  Since Cal 02 strip does not trade on a continuation, I use the 12-month strip continuation to derive a market structure for Cal 02.  Because most of the components of the 12-month strip at this time of the year are the same as Cal 02 components, the current price action for 12 month strip correlates quite nicely with Cal 02.  Below is the derived market structure for Cal 02:  4.774 Most bullish scenario.  4.271   3.874 Using 3.723 as pivot point from 12-month strip, assume that if 12-month strip closes > 3.723, then Cal 02 should be trading @ 3.874.     3.653 Current Cal 02 price.  3.240   2.476 Most bearish scenario.

"Market Structure on Prompt Continuation  Yesterday's price action saw prices trade > 3.350 and close > 3.320 on prompt continuation. This marks the first time since the decline from the 10.100 high, that a previous corrective high in the downtrend has been exceeded.  Because of this, the long term trend has now shifted from down to bottoming.   Market Structure Application to Cal 02 Strip (Non- Basis Adjusted)  Since Cal 02 strip does not trade on continuation, I use the 12-month strip continuation to derive a market structure for Cal 02.  Because most of the components of the 12-month strip at this time of year are the same as Cal 02 components, the current price action for 12 month strip correlates quite nicely with Cal 02.   In my previous memo to you, I listed 3.723 as a pivot point for 12-month strip.  This meant that if prices on 12-month strip close > 3.723, then Cal 02 should be trading @ 3.874, with a rally to 4.271 minimum expected and an outside shot at 4.774.  As of yesterday's close, 12-month strip closed at 3.803 up .285, and Cal 02 closed at 3.898, up .240. Here's the current structure:   4.774 Most bullish scenario.   4.271 Minimum upside target.   3.898 Current Cal 02 price.   3.240      2.471 Most bearish scenario.",kimberly.watson@enron.com,larry.pavlou@enron.com,NYMEX Technical Update,2001-08-16 05:47:49-07:00,received

"Steve,  FYI, on Larry's NYMEX update.  Kim.   -----Original Message----- From: Pavlou, Larry Sent: Fri 8/17/2001 9:04 AM To: Branney, Theresa; Mercaldo, Vernon; Pritchard, John; Roobaert, Preston Cc: Neubauer, Dave; Miller, Kent; Fowler, Bill; Neville, Sue; Watson, Kimberly; Williams, Jo Subject: NYMEX Technical Update  In yesterday's memo to you, I mentioned that the long-term trend has shifted from down to bottoming, with a good chance for wider trading ranges and a greater chance for volatility to the upside increasing. During this period, the primary issue now is neither a support or resistance point, but instead how much time passes without making a new low.  In a macro sense, the more time prompt continuation spends without a break below the 2.881 low, the more unlikely we'll see a breakdown to new lows.  What this means is that time appears to be on the side of the bulls and not the bears.  Here's the market structure:  5.640 If we get a decisive break > 3.880, then 5.640 is minimum implied long term upside target (.382 correction of 10.100 to 2.881)   4.490 Highest price still consistent with bear market correction.  Any reversal lower from 4.490 targets the potential for a decline to  2.510.  3.880 If prices trade > 3.880, then most bearish scenario is greatly minimized.   3.290 Current prompt continuation price     3.040 If 2.881 is a major long term low, then prices must not close < 3.040 or trade < 2.990 (.7862 and .852 of 2.881 to 3.620)  2.990     2.510    2.170 Most bearish scenario    For Elliott Wave followers, here's the revised count which shows how the numbers above are derived:  10.100 to 5.615  <I> down    5.615 to 7.100  <II> up    7.100 to 2.881  <III> down    2.881 to ?????  <IV> up    4.490 = .382 retracement; if 4.490 is top of <IV>, then <I> = <V> implies 2.510 as end of <V> down.    3.880 = .236 retracement; if 3.830 is top of <IV>, then <I> = <V> implies 2.170 as end of <V> down.

This is not a fairy tale but for real. I am Dr.Dandyson Openam, the secretary to the PresidentialTask force on Oil spillage in my country. We are the 6th largest producer of crude oil in the world and more often than not, we always experience oil spillage in the Niger Delta region of my country. These spillage causes a lot of havoc to inhabitants of the community and hence contracts are awarded especially to foreign firms to clean and mop up the spilled crude oil from the areas affected. The spillage sometimes cover several kilometres and the value of contract also runs into millions of dollars. Between 1999 to 2000, some contracts were awarded to a conglomerate of foreign firms by  my committee. While awarding these contracts, we have taken time to deliberately over invoice one of them to the tune of $31.8m ( Thirty one million, eight hundred thousand dollars) What we did was to in addition to the original contract sum, revaluate and approve this amount separately and it is presently lying idle in a suspense account with our apex bank here in Nigeria. This amount by all standard now belongs to us but we cannot claim it because it has been made to appear in the ledger as belonging to a foreign contractor. What we desire at this moment is to have this funds transferred into a foreign account but being civil servants who are still in active government service, we are barred from maintaining bank accounts overseas. Thus we have decided to solicit your assistance with a view to going into a joint partnership to get this fund out from the bank. At this juncture, we want you to provide us with a bank account where this fund can be transferred into first and thereafter, we would come over to your country to take possession of our share where we hope to invest part in profitable ventures with you as our adviser. We would like to inform you that the nature of your business or profession at this point is immaterial  because in all over the world, bigger firms after bidding for and winning some contract especially in a third world economy like ours, do subcontract part or whole of the contract to other firms for execution. It could also be carried out in any capacity as an individual. So, you or your organization, having the status of a subcontractor , with proper documentation, can file an application for the payment of this fund in your name and into your bank account. We have agreed in principle to share this fund in these ratio: 74.5% will be for my colleagues and I, 25% will be given to you for your assistance and .5% has been earmarked to take care of any expenses during the course of this transaction. All modality for the smooth transfer of this fund has been worked out and it meets all legal and administrative requirement in Nigeria as applicable to foreign contractors payment in the past. If your response is in the affirmative, within a period of two weeks or 10 working days, this fund would have been confirmed and transferred into your account. We have taken the risk aspect of it into consideration and I want to assure you that it is actually risk free as the contract will be re-awarded in your name before the application will be made. We will follow the procedures systematically with flawless documentation. This is authentic. If you feel you will be of assistance and a beneficiary from this largesse,kindly send a reply to this mail to that effect and I will oblige you with more information as to the smooth take off and conclusion of this once in a lifetime opportunity.Thanks.Your sincerely, Dr.Dandyson Openam.  ____________________________________________________________ Do You Yahoo!?

T= he Team had been working with Engineering on developing an action plan to a= ddress over the last several months.  Upon a visual inspection we requested=  that the Team contact a local contractor and have the pipe cover (dirt) re= moved immediately to allow the piping to relieve itself.  This would provid= e the necessary time to follow up with Engineering and attain feedback on t= he status of the project and implement remedies.  The Team had a contractor=  on location the following Monday 8/20, and work removing the cover was com= pleted this Monday 8/27.  However, the expected results were not achieved. =  In other words the piping did not spring back to the degree that pipe stre= ss concerns were eliminated.  We requested that a structural engineer be se= nt to the site immediately to evaluate the integrity of the piping.  He was=  on location Thursday morning (8/29).  In a phone conversation with Phil Di= ckenson (Trigon structural engineer) he mentioned that his immediate concer= n was how this much displacement could not induce high stresses.  However, = no pipe coating cracks were visible so he wanted an opportunity to input th= e data in a model and evaluate prior to making any recommendations.  He did=  offer, that at a minimum, we stand a good chance of exceeding the .5 desig= n factor, but without reviewing the data further he would not commit to a c= onclusion.  We asked that he work through the evening, if required, to prov= ide the necessary information with regards to the pipes integrity.   While = waiting on Trigons report, we notified the Team and asked that they contact=  Foutz & Bursham (local pipeline contractor) and get an evaluation from the= m on the estimated down time it would require in a worst case scenario to m= ake the repairs/replacements.  (4 to 5 days)  We then requested that the Ro= swell CDC (Ernie DeLosSantos) determine the availability of approximately 1= 50"" of X42 356 wall 10"" pipe, 12 ea. Y42  365 wall 90's, and 1 ea. Y42 365 = wall 45.  (all material is available at Redman Supply in Farmington) =20  Conclusion:   =20      Mr. Dickenson called with the results this morning and informed us tha= t we appear to be exceeding allowable stress levels.  The stress levels cal= culated by Dickinson were in excess of yield as follows:  1.09% of SMYS at = the connection between the recycle/surge line and the discharge header, and=  1.01% of SMYS at the elbow immediately outside the building wall on the 10= "" recycle line.    His recommendation was that the piping be cut and re-wel= ded to return the piping to a lower stress condition and that suitable pipe=  supports, not subject to subsidence, be provided.       Conference calls with Engineering (Spalding, Eisenstein, Rance, Pebdan= i, Minnoti ???) were set up to review the data with Mr. Dickenson and it wa= s decided to have Greg McIlwain on location Monday in conjunction with Mike=  McCracken to initiate the necessary repairs.  After much discussion with D= ickenson with regards to the modeling performed, Engineering indicated that=  the system is Operational and therefore we will remain loaded until early = next week when repairs are made.  The repairs will be isolated to the #3 un= it only so, the downtime is not expected to exceed 2 days (48 hours).  Howe= ver, furhter evaluation by McIlwain will confirm timelines. =20  If anyone has questions through the weekend prior to Mondays call, I can be=  reached at 520-853-3253.

"Steve and Dave,  As a follow up from our meeting on August 16, we all had the question about=  what, if any, price risk we had on the fuel portion of the Index to Index = deals.  Here are my thoughts...  For purposes of this discussion, let's just talk about how the Dynegy, San = Juan to SoCal Needles firm transport for 35,000 MMBtu/d for Calendar 2003 c= ould impact our fuel risk.  Dynegy will not be giving us fuel in-kind for t= his transaction.  All fuel needed for scheduled volumes on this contract wi= ll have to be provided by TW.   In a normal year TW over collects approxima= tely 25,000 MMBtu/d in fuel.  Because we will now need some of this over co= llected amount to provide the fuel for the Dynegy deal, we actually have so= mething less than the 25,000 MMBtu/d for the total 2003 fuel over collectio= n.  To make the math easy to follow for purposes of discussion, let's assum= e after all of the Index to Index deals for 2003, we will only have 20,000 = MMBtu/d of over collected fuel on the system.  We will need the remaining 5= ,000 MMBtu/d as fuel for the Index to Index deals.  Let's also assume that = we have hedged or plan to hedge (by means of the whole calendar year, seaso= nally or monthly) the 20,000 MMBtu/d of 2003 over collected fuel.  The rema= ining 5,000 MMBtu/d of over collected unhedged fuel is what will be used to=  provide the fuel for the Dynegy deal. =20  It is my thought that the price risk question surrounds the 5,000 MMBtu/d o= f the remaining over collected fuel that is not hedged.   On any day where = Dynegy would schedule the full 35,000 MMBtu/d to flow, the fuel actually bu= rned on that day for Dynegy would have the same value as all other shippers=  who provided in-kind fuel on that same day.  The other shipper's in-kind f= uel (I'm referring to the 5,000 MMBtu/d that is not hedged) is what is actu= ally used to provide fuel for Dynegy.  On this particular day, we do not ha= ve additional adverse price risk.  However, on any day that Dynegy does not=  have the full 35,000 MMBtu/d scheduled to flow, we have an opportunity los= s on the value of this fuel.  If Dynegy does not flow all or any volumes on=  their contract on any given day, there is no fuel burned.  This means that=  we now have extra gas, that was not previously hedged, in the pipe provide= d by the other in-kind shippers that we do not need for Dynegy on this part= icular day.  Now we are subject to selling this extra gas at current cash p= rices verses having the ability to hedge this volume ahead of time at a pri= ce that we felt meet our fuel hedging strategy, thus creating an opportunit= y loss. =20  Would you agree that our risk is when Dynegy does not flow?

" Howdy Miss Kim,  Bet you can wait to say Ariva Derchi and see Italy?  Where abouts are you going?  Two of my sisters went to Northern Italy a year ago and had a great time.  We had rain everyday in Scotland, but it was still so beautiful.  One night we stayed on the coast of the Irish Sea and saw there was a ferry about a half-a-block down the street so checked out where we could go.  Ended up taking a high speed ferry across the Irish Sea to Larne and did a day trip of the Irish Coast.  Fantastic.  We did a small cruise boat on Loch Ness, a tour bus, a double decker bus, the train, the ferry and the tube!  The second to the last day we drove to Gatwick, drop the car in short term parking and got a student pass  (must look younger than we thought) and took the train to Victoria Station. Walked over to Buckingham Palace, Hyde Park and Piccadilly Circus.  Took the underground to the Tower.  Hadn't been there since 1972 (probably the year you were born).  They have cleaned the entire outside of the tower and it looks fabulous.  All the displays have been reworked and everything was so interesting.  Could easily have spent an entire day there.  We're coming down the end of November for Mr. Matt's 1st birthday.  Mark, Michelle and Matt are arriving Aug 29 and leaving Sept 2.

"Don't worry, nothing's in the crack!  =)  We met and MKM, Glen, Rob & Teb were all there (among others).  We discussed that we might want to change some of our balancing provisions as filed.  Glen has set-up a meeting for Wed, Sept 5 to discuss the imbalance stuff with Ramona, Gas Logistics etc.  I can cover it and get the TW Comm Group's input as needed.  (We got Lorraine's input as far as her experience with trying to implement EPFS's 637 OBA before its time.)

Thanks, Kim.  -----Original Message----- From: richard igho [mailto:drighorich@yahoo.co.uk] Sent: Monday, August 27, 2001 8:12 AM To: kwatson@enron.com Subject: ""A POSSIBLE OIL/BUSINESS VENTURE""   Presidential Task Force on Oil spillage,DepartmentofPetroleum Resources, Victoria Island,Lagos Nigeria.BUSINESS PROPOSAL WORTH$31.8 MILLION DOLLARS STRICTLYCONFIDENTIAL  Dear Sir/Madam, This proposal is coming to you with the ardent belief that you will take advantage of our goodwill and out of our desperation to have a trusted foreign partner whom we can entrust our funds with for safekeeping. This is not a fairy tale but for real. I am Dr.Igho Richard, the secretary to the PresidentialTaskforce on Oil spillage in my country. We are the 6th largest producer of crude oil in the world and more often than not, we always experience oil spillage in the Niger Delta region of my country. These spillage causes a lot of havoc to inhabitants of the community and hence contracts are awarded especially to foreign firms to clean and mop up the spilled crude oil from the areas affected. The spillage sometimes cover several kilometres and the value of contract also runs into millions of dollars. Between 1999 to 2000, some contracts were awarded to a conglomerate of foreign firms by  my committee. While awarding these contracts, we have taken time to deliberately over invoice one of them to the tune of $31.8m ( Thirty one million, eight hundred thousand dollars) What we did was to in addition to the original contract sum, revaluate and approve this amount separately and it is presently lying idle in a suspense account with our apex bank here in Nigeria. This amount by all standard now belongs to us but we cannot claim it because it has been made to appear in the ledger as belonging to a foreign contractor. What we desire at this moment is to have this funds transferred into a foreign account but being civil servants who are still in active government service, we are barred from maintaining bank accounts overseas. Thus we have decided to solicit your assistance with a view to going into a joint partnership to get this fund out from the bank. At this juncture, we want you to provide us with a bank account where this fund can be transferred into first and thereafter, we would come over to your country to take possession of our share where we hope to invest part in profitable ventures with you as our adviser. We would like to inform you that the nature of your business or profession at this point is immaterial  because in all over the world, bigger firms after bidding for and winning some contract especially in a third world economy like ours, do subcontract part or whole of the contract to other firms for execution. It could also be carried out in any capacity as an individual. So, you or your organization, having the status of a subcontractor , with proper documentation, can file an application for the payment of this fund in your name and into your bank account. We have agreed in principle to share this fund in these ratio: 74.5% will be for my colleagues and I, 25% will be given to you for your assistance and .5% has been earmarked to take care of any expenses during the course of this transaction. All modality for the smooth transfer of this fund has been worked out and it meets all legal and administrative requirement in Nigeria as applicable to foreign contractors payment in the past. If your response is in the affirmative, within a period of two weeks or 10 working days, this fund would have been confirmed and transferred into your account. We have taken the risk aspect of it into consideration and I want to assure you that it is actually risk free as the contract will be re-awarded in your name before the application will be made. We will follow the procedures systematically with flawless documentation. This is authentic. If you feel you will be of assistance and a beneficiary from this largesse,kindly send a reply to this mail to that effect and I will oblige you with more information as to the smooth take off and conclusion of this once in a lifetimeopportunity.Thanks.Your sincerely, Dr.Igho Richard.  ____________________________________________________________ Do You Yahoo!?

Next week you will be receiving the packet spoken of below containing: A Participant Letter (see below) A manager cover letter A manager questionnaire Seven employee cover letters Seven employee questionnaires Seven pre-addressed return envelopes for the completed questionnaires.  Further information will be sent periodically.  Thanks, Maggie  **************************************************************************************************************************************** August 27, 2001  Dear Participant:  It is our pleasure to welcome you to the Becoming an Exceptional Leader: a manager's level training program on October 31 - November 2 at the Doubletree - Travis 1&2 .  The program is designed to help leaders develop the skills necessary to manage direct reports.  The program focuses on participative management skills and has leaders and their reports working together to shape goals, standards, and operating procedures, that I believe you will find both relevant and enjoyable.  Program Details  The program will begin at 8:30 a.m. each day and end at approximately 5:00 p.m. on the first 2 days and at 3:00 p.m. on the third day.  Dress is informal.  Because of the full program schedule, there will be no time for regular business contacts.  Therefore, we ask that you clear your calendar for the 3 days and make arrangements for someone to cover your phone calls.  Preparation Materials  Enclosed is the Preparation Materials booklet that you should read over and bring to the program.  Distributing the Enclosed Questionnaires  As part of your preparation for the Becoming an Exceptional Leader: a manager's level training program, you will also be distributing the enclosed questionnaires to your direct reports.  Many leaders spend a lot of time trying to figure out what their direct reports are thinking.  To help answer that question, one of the key components of this program is a confidential survey of your direct report's perceptions of your management skill.  The survey will help you to identify your strengths and determine areas in need of improvement.  You are the only person who will see the survey results, unless you decide to share them.  Distribute one of the enclosed questionnaires to each of the seven direct reports that you have selected.  You may wish to hand deliver each questionnaire so that you can personally explain its purpose.  In doing so you should emphasize that:  The reason you are asking him or her to fill out the questionnaire is to improve the quality of communication and effectiveness of work that transpires between you.  His or her responses are strictly confidential. (The survey report that you will see at the program will be the combined results of all your direct reports.)  The completed questionnaire must be received by the Forum Corporation for scoring no later than October 24th. Please allow 2 weeks for the questionnaire to travel through postal system.  The questionnaire instructions explain that the direct report must fill in the level he or she feels is required in each dimension and the level he or she feel you have attained.  I am confident that your direct reports will be happy to oblige.  The questionnaire should take no more than 10 minutes to complete.  Please note that a feedback report can only be generated for you when you use the questionnaire that I have assigned to you.  Should you or your direct reports misplace a questionnaire do not use a colleague's ""extras"" or photocopy questionnaires.  The questionnaires that have been assigned to you have a unique coding number which has been assigned specifically for you in order to create a custom feedback report.  The questionnaires assigned to you cannot be duplicated or modified in any valid way without my knowledge.  If you need replacement questionnaires for any reason, please see me and I will provide you with any extra questionnaires you may require.  I look forward to your participation in the program and know you will find it to be an interesting and rewarding experience.  If any questions remain unanswered, give me a call.

"J, D, P and J,  Here is a previous email from the travel agency regarding car and ferry info.  I have asked Dee to book the overnight ferry from Palermo to Naples.  I believe that we still have a 6 hour drive to Lucca, but that will put us there sooner than the overnight ferry to Livorno with a 2 hour drive.  She is also confirming the car and rate for us (approx $742 for each car).   FYI, I have received a few more faxes from available Rome Hotels, but none of them have a better location that what we have booked and a few of them were even more expensive than what we have booked.  Janell is on the hunt for a Florence hotel.  I will prepare faxes in mass for Florence tonight and send them out tomorrow.    Dorothy called me yesterday and wanted to know how our plans are coming.  She and Tom are very sad that they will not be able to join us.  I told her we will drink for them everyday and have them in our thoughts.  She is doing well and hopes to return to the office in about three weeks on a part time basis.  Also, John and I are confirmed in a Rome hotel for the 11th-13th which is only about 5 blocks from the train station where we will return the cars.

I have asked Dee to book the overnight ferry from Palermo to Naples.  I believe that we still have a 6 hour drive to Lucca, but that will put us there sooner than the overnight ferry to Livorno with a 2 hour drive.  She is also confirming the car and rate for us (approx $742 for each car).  FYI, I have received a few more faxes from available Rome Hotels, but none of them have a better location that what we have booked and a few of them were even more expensive than what we have booked.  Janell is on the hunt for a Florence hotel.  I will prepare faxes in mass for Florence tonight and send them out tomorrow.  Dorothy called me yesterday and wanted to know how our plans are coming. She and Tom are very sad that they will not be able to join us.  I told her we will drink for them everyday and have them in our thoughts.  She is doing well and hopes to return to the office in about three weeks on a part time basis.  Also, John and I are confirmed in a Rome hotel for the 11th-13th which is only about 5 blocks from the train station where we will return the cars.  We can put everyone's luggage in our room when we return to Rome and have a nice dinner before you guys taxi to the airport to return home.  I will keep you posted as we hear more.

I am afraid, but we do not have enough double rooms left available for the dates you require. If at all suitable for you, over the same dates we can offer you one of the following accomodations:        - either TWO triple rooms     - OR one double room and one large room for four people all our rooms have private shower/WC, color TV/radio, air conditioning and telephone.  The daily rate for such rooms in that period (extremely busy) is Lit. 320000 for each triple room OR Lit. 240000 for the double room and Lit. 400000 for the quadruple one, which at the moment works out to be around US$ 150+150 or 113+187 per night, including buffet breakfast and all taxes and service charges.  Should you wish to book (and I really hope so), we would need a confirmation e-mail or fax from you together with your Visa, Master, Amex or Diners' Club credit card number and expiration date, which will only prove as a guarantee of your arrival. Otherwise, you can e-mail or fax us the confirmation and then send us a cheque for the first night's amount, but this takes longer and is more expensive both on your and on our side. Please note that cancellations or amendments should be made in writing up to one week before arrival at the latest, otherwise the amount of the first cancelled night will be charged.  Our hotel is very centrally located only 150 yards away from Florence Cathedral and very close to all monuments and museum. In order to reach it from the Railway Station, there is a choice of three options: - a taxi will cost around Lit. 12000 and is readily available from the main exit in front of tracks no. 8-9-10); - by bus lines 11 or 17 from the side exit by track no. 5: get off at the stop after the Cathedral and walk another 50 yards on the other side of the street; - walk all the way (8-10 minutes): leave the Station by the side exit by track no. 16, take the underpass to the right until the end of it and then keep going straight ahead for about 400 yards, until reaching the Cathedral (a massive white church): at that stage turn left into Via Martelli, which becomes Via Cavour after 50 yards.  I hope that we shall be able to warmly welcome you all to our small and family managed hotel and I can assure you that we shall endeavour to make your stay in Florence as pleasant as possible.

"Kim, hope all is well.  Just wanted to touch base with you to see how things are developing with the quality conference.  You mentioned while we were visiting that you and Martha were thinking about speaking at a conference in Chicago.  We would like to attend if that is still on.  Chris, Craig and I have just finished giving the majority of our initial presentations to Mayo's various leadership committees.  We have received very favorable responses, so it appears that we will be moving forward.  Now the real work begins.  Chris and I are about to begin conducting our internal site visits and were hoping that we could get a copy of the template you used when you conducted your business sector gap analysis.  Again, we cannot thank you enough for all your guidance and help.  We would not be where we are today without your support.

"I spoke with Earl regarding the cost differences indicated for the Calpine -Topock interconnect.  The project files were discarded when the E&C Group moved to 3 Allen Center due to lack of storage capacity.  But Earl recalled that Jim Tucker said that the scope change was done at the request of Marketing which explains the two work order forms that you have.  E&C does not initiate project scope changes unless directed.  Since Calpine was supposed to ""? install measuring station to Enron specs"", the scope change items and labor (for EFM/RTU, battery backup, SCADA, and radio comm.) would have been provided by Calpine in the original work order for $68,900.  However, it is my presumption that Calpine felt that the scope change items were exotic and more suitable for Enron to handle directly; therefore, the scope change items may have been requested by Calpine to be furnished and installed by Enron at the revised work order amount of $113,900.  This type of scope change would have been consulted and approved by Marketing representation (Jeff Fawcett - Calpine rep.) prior to initiating the scope change work order.

I was surprised to find out that both agencies stated a 2-4 month delay prior to issuance.  They cited back log of other permits, public comment periods, and workload as being the main reasons.  I am particularily disappointed because there were pre meetings with both agencies identifying what was to be included in each application package, and even after the applications were submitted in March of this year, each agency came back and asked for different information that from what was discussed at each meeting.  I have a call into the state of Arizona ( construction is to begin at Station 2 and they have jurisdiction for this station) to see if we can initiate  some construction activities  such as laying pipe and building foundations prior to receiving the permit.  I have been given these types of approvals from other agencies in the past, but these types of approvals are extremely narrow and restrictive.   If this flys I am sure that they will require us to make sure the turbine is not brought on site until the permit has been issued.  I know this will require written approval from the agency, but this may allow us to proceed on schedule and avoid any delays.

"Thanks for the note....remember that on NNG, Gray is an exempt point (fuel to the Permian Mids 1-7 is only 1.06 %, and the commodity is only about a penny more than from Halley).  This should have pretty good value for the summer (value similar to your West Texas lateral).

Updates will be posted as necessary under ""bulletins"" on the Corporate Security website located at www.home.enron.com.  We do not believe that any terrorist groups will target Enron's employees or facilities.  As a precautionary measure, however, we have increased security in and around our facilities.  We urge all employees to maintain a heightened sense of awareness and to immediately report any suspicious activity to Enron Corporate Security in Houston at (713) 345-2804.   All non-essential business travel should be postponed until further notice.   Airline schedules and flights will be disrupted for some time - and bomb hoaxes, false alarms, and increased security measures will result in additional delays and disruptions.  In addition, all carriers, particularly U.S. carriers and those of U.S. allies such as Israel and NATO member countries, may be at risk for copycat hijackings.   We realize that, as Enron conducts its business, some air travel is unavoidable.   Enron employees who wish to discuss their travel options should contact Corporate Security at (713) 345-2804 or via email at CorporateSecurity@enron.com.      U.S. military action in retaliation for the terrorist attacks may result in violent Islamic extremist reactions in a number of countries, particularly in Afghanistan, Yemen, and Pakistan, as well as in Egypt, Iran, Iraq, Israel, Gaza/West Bank, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Libya, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, Syria and Tajikistan.  Reactions could take the form of acts by individuals or organized groups against U.S. government or commercial facilities.  All travel to or through these countries should be canceled.  Most of the U.S.' busiest airports have implemented the FAA's stepped-up security measures and are open and operating, with the exception of Washington Reagan National Airport.

"FYI - I spoke with John Sturn yesterday and he is coordinating the pigging of the SJ lateral to see if the efficiency of the drag reducing agent will increase.  He says the pig run will not interrupt scheduled flows on the pipe.  If the efficiency of the SJ lateral does not increase from the pig run, then Operations will look to reapply the DRA.

It is planned to try and raise the flow efficiency by running a pig.  If this does not restore the flow efficiency and capacity, re-application of the DRA will be considered.  How does pigging Bloomfield to Gallup the first week in October sound?  Darrell pointed out that would provide a week's run time on the Gallup unit and be after a rotor inspection scheduled for September 29.  I suggest the teams ensure a pig is ready and make any other preparations necessary to run the pig.  The afternoon of Monday, October 1, a conference call would be held.  If there were no complications with Gallup or any other issues, the pig run would be scheduled for Wednesday or Thursday.  If you see any problems with this or have any other suggestions, please let me know.  Also please let me know if having the conference call at 2:00 p.m., CST, Monday, October 1, would work for you, and if not, then what time would be good.

Please confirm that you are planning to attend your session by responding to this email.  This is very important since I will be distributing the packets next week.  Next week you will be receiving the packet spoken of below containing: A Participant Letter (see below) A manager cover letter A manager questionnaire Seven employee cover letters Seven employee questionnaires Seven pre-addressed return envelopes for the completed questionnaires.  Further information will be sent periodically.  Thanks, Maggie  **************************************************************************************************************************************** August 27, 2001  Dear Participant:  It is our pleasure to welcome you to the Becoming an Exceptional Leader: a manager's level training program on October 31 - November 2 at the Doubletree - Travis 1&2 .  The program is designed to help leaders develop the skills necessary to manage direct reports.  The program focuses on participative management skills and has leaders and their reports working together to shape goals, standards, and operating procedures, that I believe you will find both relevant and enjoyable.  Program Details  The program will begin at 8:30 a.m. each day and end at approximately 5:00 p.m. on the first 2 days and at 3:00 p.m. on the third day.  Dress is informal.  Because of the full program schedule, there will be no time for regular business contacts.  Therefore, we ask that you clear your calendar for the 3 days and make arrangements for someone to cover your phone calls.  Preparation Materials  Enclosed is the Preparation Materials booklet that you should read over and bring to the program.  Distributing the Enclosed Questionnaires  As part of your preparation for the Becoming an Exceptional Leader: a manager's level training program, you will also be distributing the enclosed questionnaires to your direct reports.  Many leaders spend a lot of time trying to figure out what their direct reports are thinking.  To help answer that question, one of the key components of this program is a confidential survey of your direct report's perceptions of your management skill.  The survey will help you to identify your strengths and determine areas in need of improvement.  You are the only person who will see the survey results, unless you decide to share them.  Distribute one of the enclosed questionnaires to each of the seven direct reports that you have selected.  You may wish to hand deliver each questionnaire so that you can personally explain its purpose.  In doing so you should emphasize that:  The reason you are asking him or her to fill out the questionnaire is to improve the quality of communication and effectiveness of work that transpires between you.  His or her responses are strictly confidential. (The survey report that you will see at the program will be the combined results of all your direct reports.)  The completed questionnaire must be received by the Forum Corporation for scoring no later than October 24th. Please allow 2 weeks for the questionnaire to travel through postal system.  The questionnaire instructions explain that the direct report must fill in the level he or she feels is required in each dimension and the level he or she feel you have attained.  I am confident that your direct reports will be happy to oblige.  The questionnaire should take no more than 10 minutes to complete.  Please note that a feedback report can only be generated for you when you use the questionnaire that I have assigned to you.  Should you or your direct reports misplace a questionnaire do not use a colleague's ""extras"" or photocopy questionnaires.  The questionnaires that have been assigned to you have a unique coding number which has been assigned specifically for you in order to create a custom feedback report.  The questionnaires assigned to you cannot be duplicated or modified in any valid way without my knowledge.  If you need replacement questionnaires for any reason, please see me and I will provide you with any extra questionnaires you may require.  I look forward to your participation in the program and know you will find it to be an interesting and rewarding experience.  If any questions remain unanswered, give me a call.

Further information will be sent periodically.  Thanks, Maggie  **************************************************************************************************************************************** August 27, 2001  Dear Participant:  It is our pleasure to welcome you to the Becoming an Exceptional Leader: a manager's level training program on October 31 - November 2 at the Doubletree - Travis 1&2 .  The program is designed to help leaders develop the skills necessary to manage direct reports.  The program focuses on participative management skills and has leaders and their reports working together to shape goals, standards, and operating procedures, that I believe you will find both relevant and enjoyable.  Program Details  The program will begin at 8:30 a.m. each day and end at approximately 5:00 p.m. on the first 2 days and at 3:00 p.m. on the third day.  Dress is informal.  Because of the full program schedule, there will be no time for regular business contacts.  Therefore, we ask that you clear your calendar for the 3 days and make arrangements for someone to cover your phone calls.  Preparation Materials  Enclosed is the Preparation Materials booklet that you should read over and bring to the program.  Distributing the Enclosed Questionnaires  As part of your preparation for the Becoming an Exceptional Leader: a manager's level training program, you will also be distributing the enclosed questionnaires to your direct reports.  Many leaders spend a lot of time trying to figure out what their direct reports are thinking.  To help answer that question, one of the key components of this program is a confidential survey of your direct report's perceptions of your management skill.  The survey will help you to identify your strengths and determine areas in need of improvement.  You are the only person who will see the survey results, unless you decide to share them.  Distribute one of the enclosed questionnaires to each of the seven direct reports that you have selected.  You may wish to hand deliver each questionnaire so that you can personally explain its purpose.  In doing so you should emphasize that:  The reason you are asking him or her to fill out the questionnaire is to improve the quality of communication and effectiveness of work that transpires between you.  His or her responses are strictly confidential. (The survey report that you will see at the program will be the combined results of all your direct reports.)  The completed questionnaire must be received by the Forum Corporation for scoring no later than October 24th. Please allow 2 weeks for the questionnaire to travel through postal system.  The questionnaire instructions explain that the direct report must fill in the level he or she feels is required in each dimension and the level he or she feel you have attained.

(FERC indicated in its July order that it=  intended to extend the reporting requirement through 9/30/02 to coincide w= ith the end date of its mitigation plan.)

Below is a summary of the report that was in Inside Ferc and attached is a copy of the full report (123 pages).  There's an executive summary at the beginning which is about 10 pages.  Although, as stated in the summary, the Commission found a lack of sufficient capacity on El Paso as a contributor to high prices, they do not take on the issue of market power as had been suggested by the CPUC and other commenters and blame the pipeline for such prices.  Instead they cite El Paso capacity problems as one of several factors which caused high prices last winter.  I'll keep you advised as to what happens on Wedneday at the CEC meeting.  gh    IN NEW REPORT, CEC COMMITTEE KEEPS EMPHASIS ON IN-STATE GAS CAPACITY Constrained interstate gas pipeline capacity was just one of the factors that led to high natural gas prices in California last fall and winter, according to a report issued last week by a committee of the California Energy Commission. The revised final report on gas infrastructure issues notably skirted the issue of market power as a factor in the gas price spikes that rocked the state. After taking into consideration comments from the California Public Utilities Commission and others, the report to the full CEC concluded that a number of factors were involved. ""Insufficient receipt capacity within California and insufficient capacity on the El Paso [Natural Gas Co.] pipeline system both contrib-uted to the high price of natural gas in the fall and winter of 2000,"" the Sept. 24 report said. The CEC is scheduled to vote Wednesday on the report. The revised version took into account scarcity on the El Paso system but did not place the blame entirely on that, noting the high demand for gas-fired electric generation and relatively low storage levels during times of high gas prices. ""As a result of the insufficient capacity both to and within California, buyers were less able to force suppliers to bid against each other. Whether prices during this period were, in whole or in part, the result of a free market's rationing of scarce suppliers through a scarcity premium, or entirely the result of price manipulation, is beyond the scope of this report,"" wrote Commissioner Michal Moore, presiding member of CEC's electricity and natural gas committee. Pointing to the high-profile CPUC complaint (RP00-241) against El Paso Corp. pending at FERC, the CEC added that it had ""every confidence that the interests of California ratepayers will be well-represented by the CPUC."" The report pointed to the fact that California shippers surrendered large blocks of capacity on the El Paso system in recent years. ""The shortfall in capacity was absorbed by California, and not the upstream customers. This is due, in part, to the decision a few years ago by California to turn back part of its rights to firm capacity on the El Paso system. It is also due to the failure by El Paso to honor its contractual commit-ment to deliver capacity paid for by California,"" the report noted. Moore's committee had postponed issuance of the report after receiving comments on a draft version from the CPUC, The Utility Reform Network and Southern California Edison Co., which all called for consideration of allegations that El Paso exerted market power over gas sales into California (IF, 27 Aug, 1). The draft pointed to insufficient takeaway capacity in California and called for slack capacity in the range of 15% to 20% (IF, 13 Aug, 4). The report went on to suggest that California ""can no longer plan for the future as if we lived in a regulated, cost-plus environment. Under price regulation, adverse hydroelectric conditions and extreme temperatures did not lead to extreme price spikes. Under today's conditions, that is no longer the case."" Moore added that the state's ""virtual complete reliance"" on gas for electric generation has contributed to the new dynamics surrounding capacity planning. More than 100,000 Mw of gas-fired generation proposed for the Western Systems Coordinating Council region demands expansion of the regional pipeline grid, the report continued, saying the CEC was ""encour-aged"" by recently announced expansion plans by interstate pipelines and FERC's stated intent to expedite review of such proposals. The report also noted that Southern California Gas Co. is developing 375,000 Mcf/ day of additional receipt capacity, which should be ready by the end of the year. Also, Pacific Gas and Electric Co. plans to add as much as 600,000 Mcf/day of capacity by 2003, according to the report. It observed that intrastate pipelines, in particular those in Southern California, ran at close to full capacity at times this and last year, which created bottlenecks in delivering supplies from interstate pipelines to gas consumers, including electric generators in 2000 and early 2001. High prices in the future could be held at bay with the in-state expansions and the CPUC's recent approval of SoCal Gas' plan to remove 37 Bcf of cushion and working gas from three storage fields in Montebello and Aliso Canyon in Los Angeles County and La Goleta in Santa Barbara County (IF, 2 July, 3). In addition to strongly emphasizing intrastate needs, the report recommended that the state ""analyze the consequences of the increasing upstream gas demands on the El Paso pipeline system as they affect the flows of natural gas and electricity"" between California and the Southwest U.S. and Mexico. According to the report, the state also should: encourage in-state gas production; re-evaluate design criteria for the intrastate system in consideration of growing power generation demand; consider gas curtailment mechanisms; ""optimize"" storage; and encourage the creation of new storage facilities in the state.

Thanks, Kim.   -----Original Message----- From: Hass, Glen Sent: Mon 10/1/2001 4:45 PM To: Miller, Mary Kay; Kilmer III, Robert; Brennan, Lorna; Donoho, Lindy; Harris, Steven; Lindberg, Lorraine; Lohman, TK; Lokay, Michelle; Moore, Jan; Watson, Kimberly Cc:  Subject: CEC Infrastructure Report  The California Energy Commission has issued its final report on the California Infrastructure which is to be voted upon by the Commision on Wednesday.  Below is a summary of the report that was in Inside Ferc and attached is a copy of the full report (123 pages).  There's an executive summary at the beginning which is about 10 pages.  Although, as stated in the summary, the Commission found a lack of sufficient capacity on El Paso as a contributor to high prices, they do not take on the issue of market power as had been suggested by the CPUC and other commenters and blame the pipeline for such prices.  Instead they cite El Paso capacity problems as one of several factors which caused high prices last winter.  I'll keep you advised as to what happens on Wedneday at the CEC meeting.  gh    IN NEW REPORT, CEC COMMITTEE KEEPS EMPHASIS ON IN-STATE GAS CAPACITY Constrained interstate gas pipeline capacity was just one of the factors that led to high natural gas prices in California last fall and winter, according to a report issued last week by a committee of the California Energy Commission. The revised final report on gas infrastructure issues notably skirted the issue of market power as a factor in the gas price spikes that rocked the state. After taking into consideration comments from the California Public Utilities Commission and others, the report to the full CEC concluded that a number of factors were involved. ?Insufficient receipt capacity within California and insufficient capacity on the El Paso [Natural Gas Co.] pipeline system both contrib-uted to the high price of natural gas in the fall and winter of 2000,? the Sept. 24 report said. The CEC is scheduled to vote Wednesday on the report. The revised version took into account scarcity on the El Paso system but did not place the blame entirely on that, noting the high demand for gas-fired electric generation and relatively low storage levels during times of high gas prices. ?As a result of the insufficient capacity both to and within California, buyers were less able to force suppliers to bid against each other. Whether prices during this period were, in whole or in part, the result of a free market?s rationing of scarce suppliers through a scarcity premium, or entirely the result of price manipulation, is beyond the scope of this report,? wrote Commissioner Michal Moore, presiding member of CEC?s electricity and natural gas committee. Pointing to the high-profile CPUC complaint (RP00-241) against El Paso Corp. pending at FERC, the CEC added that it had ?every confidence that the interests of California ratepayers will be well-represented by the CPUC.? The report pointed to the fact that California shippers surrendered large blocks of capacity on the El Paso system in recent years. ?The shortfall in capacity was absorbed by California, and not the upstream customers. This is due, in part, to the decision a few years ago by California to turn back part of its rights to firm capacity on the El Paso system. It is also due to the failure by El Paso to honor its contractual commit-ment to deliver capacity paid for by California,? the report noted. Moore?s committee had postponed issuance of the report after receiving comments on a draft version from the CPUC, The Utility Reform Network and Southern California Edison Co., which all called for consideration of allegations that El Paso exerted market power over gas sales into California (IF, 27 Aug, 1). The draft pointed to insufficient takeaway capacity in California and called for slack capacity in the range of 15% to 20% (IF, 13 Aug, 4). The report went on to suggest that California ?can no longer plan for the future as if we lived in a regulated, cost-plus environment. Under price regulation, adverse hydroelectric conditions and extreme temperatures did not lead to extreme price spikes. Under today?s conditions, that is no longer the case.? Moore added that the state?s ?virtual complete reliance? on gas for electric generation has contributed to the new dynamics surrounding capacity planning. More than 100,000 Mw of gas-fired generation proposed for the Western Systems Coordinating Council region demands expansion of the regional pipeline grid, the report continued, saying the CEC was ?encour-aged? by recently announced expansion plans by interstate pipelines and FERC?s stated intent to expedite review of such proposals. The report also noted that Southern California Gas Co. is developing 375,000 Mcf/ day of additional receipt capacity, which should be ready by the end of the year. Also, Pacific Gas and Electric Co. plans to add as much as 600,000 Mcf/day of capacity by 2003, according to the report. It observed that intrastate pipelines, in particular those in Southern California, ran at close to full capacity at times this and last year, which created bottlenecks in delivering supplies from interstate pipelines to gas consumers, including electric generators in 2000 and early 2001.

If we can not shut down the unit, we can still reduce or demand costs by minimizing our power usage during the peak period.  Unlike Hubbard where the contract states avoiding the peak during a specified period of the day (5-7 PM), Gallup requires us to guess both the day of the month their peak will occur and the time of day.  Through access to Tri-States history data, I can guess what I think the minimum peak for the month will be.  I can look at the current day's usage and estimate if today's peak will be higher than the higher of (1) my estimated peak or (2) the actual peak so far this month.  If so, the ""Probability today is a peak"" will be near 100 indicating the operators they should expect a possible power peak sometime today.   The ""Probability now is peak"" approached 100 when an actual peak is underway.  The Tri-State Power Peak In Progress alarm triggers when a power peak is underway.  Note that it is impossible to predict with 100% accuracy if any day in the month is an actual power peak.  If the first day of the month has an estimated peak 1000 and last years peak for the same month, was 985.  It appears possible that this will be a power peak day.  Assume that the actual peak usage for the first day was 1010.  Now on the second day of the month, the estimated peak is 965, not likely to be a power peak day.  The third day has an estimated peak of 1005, a possible power peak day.  If the actual for the third day is 1012, it now becomes the new peak for the month.  If all other estimated peaks in the month are significantly below 1012, they are not likely to be power peaks, and unit turndown is not required.  The point is, to completely avoid demand charges, we would have had to shut down the unit for a period on the first day of the month, and also on the third day.  The utility integrates their peak over a 30 minute period, thus the minimum time the unit could be down.  I'm guessing that my utility could predict around seven peaks requiring turndown in a given month.  So far this month, I guessed a power peak on 10/1/01 starting at 20:18 and ending at 21:05.  The actual peak so far this month according to the utility was 10/1/01 starting at 20:30 lasting to 21:00.   I'm sorry for any confusion.  I had asked Dale to pass this information on to the Operators.

"Let's plan on meeting today after Steve's staff meeting to discuss.  The existing imbalances as of the effective date of the tariff OBA will have to be individually negotiated with the party to resolve separate and apart from any imbalance that occurs under the new OBA.  TW's tariff states that if the OBA party does not execute/sign the tariff OBA, they are still subject to the tariff OBA if they physically receive or deliver gas into/out of Transwestern's system. These relationships will have to be managed carefully from all sides to resolve the old imbalances while moving forward with the tariff OBA for new imbalances.

If we can not shut down the unit, we can still reduce or demand costs by minimizing our power usage during the peak period.  Unlike Hubbard where the contract states avoiding the peak during a specified period of the day (5-7 PM), Gallup requires us to guess both the day of the month their peak will occur and the time of day.  Through access to Tri-States history data, I can guess what I think the minimum peak for the month will be.  I can look at the current day's usage and estimate if today's peak will be higher than the higher of (1) my estimated peak or (2) the actual peak so far this month.  If so, the ""Probability today is a peak"" will be near 100 indicating the operators they should expect a possible power peak sometime today.   The ""Probability now is peak"" approached 100 when an actual peak is underway.  The Tri-State Power Peak In Progress alarm triggers when a power peak is underway.  Note that it is impossible to predict with 100% accuracy if any day in the month is an actual power peak.  If the first day of the month has an estimated peak 1000 and last years peak for the same month, was 985.  It appears possible that this will be a power peak day.  Assume that the actual peak usage for the first day was 1010.  Now on the second day of the month, the estimated peak is 965, not likely to be a power peak day.  The third day has an estimated peak of 1005, a possible power peak day.  If the actual for the third day is 1012, it now becomes the new peak for the month.  If all other estimated peaks in the month are significantly below 1012, they are not likely to be power peaks, and unit turndown is not required.  The point is, to completely avoid demand charges, we would have had to shut down the unit for a period on the first day of the month, and also on the third day.  The utility integrates their peak over a 30 minute period, thus the minimum time the unit could be down.  I'm guessing that my utility could predict around seven peaks requiring turndown in a given month.  So far this month, I guessed a power peak on 10/1/01 starting at 20:18 and ending at 21:05.  The actual peak so far this month according to the utility was 10/1/01 starting at 20:30 lasting to 21:00.   I'm sorry for any confusion.  I had asked Dale to pass this information on to the Operators.

Here is a high level recap in relation to impacts on TW:   1.  SoCal will NOT set the capacity at needles lower than 750 unless       they have operational problems. And they will maintain 750 for a gas        day (during all cycles).  (Good news for TW)   2.  SoCal may set a capacity higher than 750.  If they do, they will       maintain that capacity for a gas day (during all cycles), unless there       are specific operational problems. (Good news for TW)       4.  SoCal will have the option to call OFO's at the beginning of each cycle       for the gas day, which could cause a confirmation reduction.  Today they       only call an OFO before the gas day begins.   Starting Nov. 1, they can        call an OFO anytime before a GISB cycle, including Intraday 1 and        Intraday 2 which are cycles in the gas day. (This will be a major impact       to SoCal's customers)   5.  SoCal says the ""windowing"" is gone.  But, they are still giving us a       capacity and TW will continue to do the allocation if nominations       exceed their capacity.   6.  SoCal can still reduce the scheduled volumes after an allocation.  This       would be due to SoCal's market not burning their schedule.  At that       time SoCal will confirm down to the market burn.   Overall, our process does not change. If you have any questions, please  let me know.  Thanks.

I have listened to the message from Questar and it seems like that the Morongo Valley area ( with R.O.W issues) is a few miles away  from the SOCAL interconnect.  The distance from Needles to SOCAL interconnect is approximately 90 miles. The horse power requirements to handle up to 100 mmcf/d from Needles to SOCAL is around 2,500 hp.  Based on the above, and also assuming that SOCAL has the capacity to handle up to 100 mmcf/d at a pressure of 850 psig at this location, the conversion/ compression cost is as follows:   Conversion costs for 90 miles:   $9,000,000   Compression cost:               $6,000,000   Total costs    $15,000,000  Note: As we have discussed before this cost is based on EE&CC cost estimate of 1997 plus 5% escalation for each year.

First I must say it was one of the most smoothly run Dr. visits I've been on.  We had an appointment at 1:30 and low and behold we were talking to the Dr. at 1:30!  The Dr. was also very nice.  He answer our questions without being arrogant and he spoke in plain English.     Basically he said the modern theory was that half of the cases went away on their own, so we have an appointment in 3 months to check on Power  establish a trend line.  In the mean time he's free to do what he wants to but allowed to sit out if his hip bothers him, i.e.  self limiting kind of like my top speed on a bike.  If at 3 months its getting better, we continue the agressive treatment by visiting every 3 months.  If it is not getting better then we look at something more intrusive.  He explained the crutches and braces that used to be the normal treatment were more to slow the boys down than anything else and recent studies had not proven them that effective.  Power is also allowed to take some Motrin or other over the counter pain medication if he wants.   The Dr. discouraged anything like cross country running, but emphasized keeping the joint exercised was good, so no couch potato.  The Dr. okayed the wheels so bike and skates are back on the menu.  Judy is going to sign him up for the Wednesday swim in the indoor pool at the park in Katy.

He ran to the edge of a cliff and, being unable to stop himself, went  over the edge. He caught the branch of a tree on his way down. He  looked down and way below on the ground was another tiger. He glanced  aside and saw a strawberry on a bush growing from the edge of the cliff  beside him. He let go of the limb with one hand, picked the strawberry  and savored it.     This story is told as an example of the ability to enjoy a true  present.     But how can we do that when our experience is that our lives are  falling apart?     Our lives are really no different than they were prior to 9/11. What  is different is that we see the reality of ""what is"" a bit better.  True, these are difficult times. I'm inviting you to come to the  Ordinary Life Gathering this Sunday. What I want to offer is comfort  and suggestions on not just how to survive our present circumstances  but how to thrive in the midst of the places that scare us.     I look forward to seeing you then.  Much love,  Bill Kerley  ======================================  Ordinary Life is a gathering that provides an opportunity to develop an  enlightened heart and an awakened mind to the reality of the present  moment.  The gathering meets on Sunday mornings at 9:45 am in Fondren Hall at  St. Paul's UMC - 5501 South Main, Houston, Texas and is taught by Dr.  Bill Kerley.

Regent will own 75% of the project, while MEVCO will own the remaining 25%. The estimated cost of the project comes in at $250 million.  Under the agreement, MEVCO will manage the permitting, estimated at 6 to 9 months, and construction process, arranging the equity as needed for same. Regent will be prepared to give up 50% (total) of its 75% net for the financing, netting a 25% interest following the equity/debt financing.  Further terms of the agreement provide that MEVCO will assist Regent in the acquisition of several gas fields in the Four Corners area, San Juan and Rio Ariba Counties of New Mexico, totaling an estimated 90+ Bcf and 20 MMcf/d current production. This production will be sufficient to power 100 MW of the power plant, with the remaining supply to be aggregated from other San Juan producers.  MEVCO Managing Director Phillip Gennarelli noted, ""We are pleased to be involved in this project with Regent. The addition of more producing properties in the area that we bring Regent, coupled with Regent's Horseshoe Gallup holdings, which are in direct proximity with the existing Four Corners Power Plant and the route of the recently announced Sonoran Pipeline venture of Calpine and Kinder Morgan, will provide an unequaled opportunity for both companies.""  Regent President John Ehrman said, ""The additional production from producing properties which MEVCO is assisting Regent in purchasing, currently producing some $1.5 million per month in net operating income, coupled with the additional income through power generation helps Regent to maximize the location of our holdings in relation to the proximity of the existing power plant and transmission lines to key electricity markets in Los Angeles and other western markets. It is a good use of our surface lease, not related to the current proved mineral reserves of the lease.""  The producing oil and properties which MEVCO is assisting Regent in purchasing are in Regent's core area of the Four Corners region near Farmington, NM. Regent will be required to finance the acquisition of the oil and gas proven producing properties under consideration.  Recently, Regent announced that it was in the process of purchasing the interests of all remaining working interest owners in the field, a transaction that is expected to be consummated by the end of the third quarter 2001, giving Regent 100% ownership of the current minerals on the lease.

To: Kevin Hyatt/ET&S/Enron cc:    Subject: Salt Domes  Kevin, I can't remember who was asking (or if it was even Marketing asking the question) but, a couple of weeks ago someone wanted to know if we knew of any salt domes or potential storage fields in the Needles area.   Well I kind of forgot about it for a few weeks and once I got to checking there are some salt domes in the Kingman area.  They are located about 10 miles North of Kingman and word is that El Paso had looked into developing these domes several years ago but never did anything but look.  I'm under the impression that the area is still privately owned but I'm not certain.  Anyhow, just thought we would pass this along and if this is something of interest or if you need more information let us know....  Oh yea, Transwesterns pipeline is just South of Kingman, Az.  (approximately 10 to 12 miles from the domes.)    ---------------------- Forwarded by David Roensch/ET&S/Enron on 07/09/2001 09:40 AM --------------------------- From: Kimberly Watson/ENRON@enronXgate on 07/09/2001 11:11 AM CDT To: David Roensch/ET&S/Enron@ENRON cc:    Subject: FW: TW Salt Dome Storage  Tiny,  Now that we are bobbing up for air from Red Rock, I wanted to investigate this a little further.

Well I kind of forgot about it for a few weeks and once I got to checking there are some salt domes in the Kingman area.  They are located about 10 miles North of Kingman and word is that El Paso had looked into developing these domes several years ago but never did anything but look.  I'm under the impression that the area is still privately owned but I'm not certain.

The producing oil and properties which MEVCO is assisting Regent in purchasing are in Regent's core area of the Four Corners region near Farmington, NM. Regent will be required to finance the acquisition of the oil and gas proven producing properties under consideration.  Recently, Regent announced that it was in the process of purchasing the interests of all remaining working interest owners in the field, a transaction that is expected to be consummated by the end of the third quarter 2001, giving Regent 100% ownership of the current minerals on the lease.

"FYI. ILY. SYWN?  JTW.  >===== Original Message From ordinarylife-owner@yahoogroups.com ===== ORDINARY LIFE - Thoughts and Ideas to Help You Live a Happier Life  ======================================         Summary of October 21, 2001  ======================================  Dear Folks ?     This week's gathering focused on how, in light of our present circumstances, can we learn to practice a true present and enjoy the good that is all around us?     We must develop    Wisdom about the way life works,    Skill in making life work for us, and    Faith that will sustain us in all times.     The blackest, bleakest day in Christian history was essential for the brightest.  ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++      Full text of the presentation  ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++     Noticing and Enjoying Strawberries     In the e-mail preview of our time together today I told the following story. It is a very famous story from the Buddhist tradition:     The story is of a monk who was fleeing a tiger. He ran to the edge of a cliff and, being unable to stop himself, went over the edge. On the way down he caught the branch of a tree. He had been saved. He looked down and, way below on the ground, was another tiger. He must hang on with all his might. No way to go back up and certain death below. As he was hanging there, he glanced aside and saw a strawberry on a bush growing from the edge of the cliff beside him. He let go of the limb with one hand, picked the strawberry and savored it.     This story, of course, is a parable. It is told to illustrate the importance of developing the ability to enjoy a true present.     Our present circumstances are certainly chaotic are they not? How are we to develop the ability to enjoy the delicious strawberry that is just within reach? Indeed, how can we develop the ability even to notice that the strawberry is there? That's what our time together is going to be about today - developing the ability to notice and enjoy strawberries even when things fall apart.     Let me begin with some preliminary observations just to make sure we are all on the same page.     In the last fourteen years, I have given almost 700 different talks. That's a lot. Does anyone have that much to say?     The answer to that is, ""No!"" Twenty years or so ago, working with my teacher/mentor Carlyle Marney, I came up with something of a creed. I could put the entire Christian faith in less than fifty words. Here they are:     God is in our history with a searching love.    Jesus Christ is central.    The cross is unavoidable.    Church is a community of believers and there is no salvation by one's self. That is to say, faith is relational.    Discipline is required.    We can live an assured hope. That is to say, there is a saving possibility in every situation.     That, from a Christian perspective, is what we have to talk about. What changes is    our understanding of it,    our circumstances and    us.     One of the things that has changed, of course, is that on 9/11 we began to be forced to notice what is going on around us. Mostly, however, we have seen just tigers chasing us and a huge abyss below us with more tigers. You don't hear much talk about delicious strawberries. Indeed, we are frantically looking for the branch to hold on to. I hope that you get at least that much here.     I was working out at my athletic club on Wednesday and was struggling away reading about Methodist Polity while doing the stair- master. On a recumbent bike in front of me was a man - I admire him for his spunk; 82 and still working out daily - who was pontificating about how to deal with our nation's current crisis. He went on and on about how ""the only way to fight terrorism is with terrorism.""     Like you, I have seen the newspapers, magazines and listened to the programs on radio and television. I found it funny as all get-out that on one of the television news magazine programs this past week they were talking about how we were becoming a nation of terrorized people. Hello! They are the ones who are stirring up the fear. ""What should you have in your survival kit? Stay tuned for the news that follows."" Give me a break.     Yet the fact is that our government officials are saying more terrorist attacks are likely to take place in this country. How do we live with that?     I do not want to ignore or deny the tigers chasing us or the abyss. I do want what my teaching is about to help us notice and enjoy the strawberries.     This circumstance that we find ourselves in can be the perfect teaching moment for us.     We don't like this because we have come in our culture to value comfort so much. But the feelings of loss and fear that we have experienced since 9/11 can show us, with terrifying clarity, exactly what our spiritual work needs to be.     Not only has an emphasis on comfort seduced us away from reality but also so has the need for each of us to appear to the other that we've got it all together.     Let me be very clear: spiritual practice isn't about being good; it is about waking up.     One day Gabriel was walking about in the heavenly realm. He came upon God and it was apparent that God was very depressed. Gabriel said to God, ""What's the matter?"" God said, pointing to the earth, ""Look at what a mess they have made of everything. Nothing is going like I had hoped it would. I'm going to destroy the lot of them.""    ""But you can't do that,"" Gabriel said.    ""And why not? I'm God, the Almighty. I can do whatever I wish.""    ""Because,"" said Gabriel, ""you promised.""    ""I did?""    ""Yes. At the time of the great flood.""    ""Well, then, I'm going to get rid of most of them. Send someone to go over all the earth and find the truly righteous. Give to each of the righteous a small brass plaque so that when I send the angel of death to destroy, the angel of death will be able to distinguish the righteous from those who are not.""    So Gabriel did as he was instructed. And, do you know what the brass plaque said? No? You didn't get one either?     Our eyes have been opened by the events of 9/11 and following. We hate it. We want to run.     In the past we have run. We have used all sorts of things to escape the way life is.     One of the things we've used is humor. I don't think I heard one single joke about the Oklahoma City bombing, did you? I'm beginning to hear some about aspects of our current crisis.     Conan O'Brien said, ""It was reported today that Osama Bin Laden has 50 brothers and sisters. Which absolutely shocked me because I had no idea he was Catholic""     Jay Leno said this: ""You read about all these terrorists, most of them came here legally, but they hung around on these expired visas, some for as long as 10-15 years. Now, compare that to Blockbuster; you are two days late with a video and these people are all over you. Let's put Blockbuster in charge of immigration.""     Here are some more Leno lines:     ""The U.S. Government has said they are now going to go after the terrorist's electronic banking system. You know what they should do? They should transfer Bin Laden's funds to my bank. They'd mess up his deposits, screw up his statement and nickel and dime him to death with service charges.""     ""More and more facts coming out about Osama bin Laden. You know, he never sleeps in the same place two nights in a row, just like Clinton.""     We have other ways of protecting ourselves from ""what is."" Each and every one of us has wanted to be able - and this is the first principle of Ordinary Life - to be an exception to the way life is. We have wanted to get a leg up on life and in the process we only cause ourselves more suffering. So we protect ourselves from the pain by all sorts of addictions. We work furiously to get those things we have been taught will make us happy - when we finally have them. We are committed to happy endings and trying to make them become realities robs us of the very life we say we want.     If we can't manipulate the situation, what can we do?     Three things:    we must develop wisdom about the way life is,    skill in making life work for us, and    a faith that can sustain us at all times, especially during the times when there seems to be no rational reason to believe at all.     To do any of this takes creative imagination, the ability to see things out of our usual way of seeing them. I will stoop to almost any means whatever to get you to think ""outside the box"" in spiritual terms.     If we are going to experience and participate in the abundant life, - if we are going to notice and appreciate the strawberries - we have to use our minds. And our spirits.     Last Sunday in our dialogue time together I reminded you that the central facet of the Christian faith if a belief in the resurrection. There are, as you might imagine, many different views and interpretations of the resurrection from very conservative folks who believe in the bodily resurrection of Jesus to those very liberal Christian who see it as a metaphor of a new life that is possible in the now moment, made available by faith. Some folks get caught up in fights about which of these positions is correct. I'm not interested in that. I want to offer you and me insights and methods that will assist us in living as fully and freely and bravely and beautifully as we possibly can.     One of the teachings we can get out of 9/11 is that none of us knows how much longer we have to live. We have hopes and assumptions but not real knowledge. What do you want to do with that time you have left?     What I want to do with that period of time is create life-enhancing events and experiences for myself and you. That isn't the only thing I want to do but it is the main thing. With that in mind let's take a step in that direction.     In order for there to be a resurrection in Christian theology, there first had to be - crucifixion. The crucifixion was the early church's version of September 11. Now, I know this is a very imperfect analogy. But bear with me a moment.     The crucifixion of Jesus took place on a day that soon began to be called ""Good Friday."" Why call it good? I know, ""good Friday"" is a corruption of ""God's Friday.""  But the phrase ""good Friday"" has stuck for a reason.  After all, it would be just as easy to say ""God's Friday.""  Why is it called good? What could be good about it?  What could be good about it for us? Because when you look at it, it seems to most assuredly a holy mess.     One of Jesus' disciples deals with his disappointment and frustration by betraying his teacher. He careens out of control, eventually committing suicide.     The politicians of the day dealt with the events of the day in a way that foreshadows quandaries that we see in things like the some of the decisions in the Middle East we are paying such a price for now. They arrest Jesus, then attempt to release him, then hear his case, then consider the religious opposition to him.     The religious community fares no better as they function in a dither. They orchestrate a way to honor the letter of their law but slaughter the spirit of it. Then they completely lose control as the man they most want to abolish is labeled their king.     The climate is emotionally explosive. Nerves are set on edge. Peter takes it out on an innocent bystander by cutting his ear off.     Pilate has second thoughts but is afraid to trust his better judgment when he sees how vicious the crowd has become. And the crowd is unruly, uneasy, in that volatile state that precedes bedlam.     The evening news reports that nature itself is out of kilter, torn by violent storms; darkness comes at mid-day.     There is confusion and chaos about this so-called Good Friday.     We have trouble with confusion and chaos. We are creatures of order. Control is most important to us. Our ideal person is one who has it all together, as we put it: one who has everything under control. To lose control, in our view of things, is a form of sickness. One of the things we hope and pray for is that as we get older we won't lose control of our bodies or fall victim to some disease where we lose control. We would rather die. Certainly we don't want anyone else controlling us either sick or well.     Good Friday is chaotic. The day is nonsensical. But maybe, just maybe that is precisely what the day is about - a kind of confusion and chaos that our minds, to say nothing about our hearts, can't organize.     Chaos comes and we are in panic. Our need to make sense out of it goes into overdrive. When we ourselves lose control and go outside our values, and we do, the complex mixture of pain and shame is overwhelming.     A few years ago as I was leaving the house to go to work, the phone rang with the news that during the night a drug crazed kid had, apparently at random selection, broken into the home of two friends of ours and bludgeoned them to death while they slept. Just two weekends before they had gone on a retreat with this Sunday School class. The event made me crazy trying to make sense of it. You just never know who or when or where things might suddenly stop happening.     Jesus is brutally murdered by truly good people just doing their jobs. And we look at that and it makes no sense to us. We want to organize it and explain it with some political or psychological or theological premise. We always end up exasperated.     One of the problems with the story of the crucifixion of Jesus is that we who do so love to be in control are comforted because we already know the end of this story.     Yet I will assert that we who do so love to be in control really do not know what to do with this day.     It is for that very reason that we call this day good. It is good in the sense that it is good for us. It is good for us to be made to stare into this mess which is so far beyond our control. It is good for us because it reminds us of what happens when our design runs amuck. It is good for us because it reminds us that we are not in absolute control even when we think we are. It is good for us also because it reminds us of our origins and our ends.     Now pay attention: There is theological construction under way here. Put on your hard hats and thinking caps.     The only other place in the scriptural tradition that invites us to contemplate such a formless, chaotic, and unfathomably dark mystery is the Genesis story which tells us that in the beginning ""the earth was without form and void, and darkness was upon the face of the deep."" We are reminded that we are children of chaos, born of its confusion and fashioned out of its corruptible elements, called by the spirit of God from the tumult and shaped by God into whatever order we shall ever know. The great discomfort of Good Friday then is not the pain we inflicted upon Jesus, not even the sorrow of his death but the reality of the chaos it reveals. It is, most assuredly a holy mess. But notice that our tradition sees within Jesus what they called the ""new Adam."" If Jesus be the new Adam, then Good Friday, so filled with chaos is also the first day of the new creation. The crucifixion and the turmoil and the confusion surrounding it constitute the raw mass of chaos from which a new order is made. And the humble, humiliating lesson that awaits us is that this new order, like the chaos, is beyond our control. Admitting this has never been easy, especially in our culture, and especially for those whose lives are built upon making sense out of things and staying in control.     So I invite you to take your place in the midst of the chaos, to pay homage to the nonsense. If we could just let go of those instinctive inclinations to probe the chaos or grasp it, we might find ourselves in all of it. And if we could go through life and come before God in this manner, we might know the wisdom that would set us free. We might actually be strengthened to face, in humility, the overwhelming chaos and the numbing nonsense of our own time.     I heard someone say the other day, and this is so typical of us when things don't go to our liking, ""I don't see how a God of love and justice could allow the events of September 11 to happen. I can't believe in God anymore.""     Folks, it is not God who is put to the test here any more than God was put to a test on Good Friday. It is we ourselves who are put to the test. And when we have seen this truth and made it ours, when we have given up our vain attempts to undo history, to guarantee the present, or to predetermine the future, we might see more clearly that we are the creatures and God is the creator.     Maybe that would make each day a new creation for us. Maybe we could even be quiet enough to hear what God says after every act of creation, creation out of the chaos, ""It is good.""     So there it hangs: a beautiful delicious strawberry. Got the faith to reach out and taste it? God, let's pray that we do.

Regent will own 75% of the project, while MEVCO will own the remaining 25%. The estimated cost of the project comes in at $250 million.  Under the agreement, MEVCO will manage the permitting, estimated at 6 to 9 months, and construction process, arranging the equity as needed for same. Regent will be prepared to give up 50% (total) of its 75% net for the financing, netting a 25% interest following the equity/debt financing.  Further terms of the agreement provide that MEVCO will assist Regent in the acquisition of several gas fields in the Four Corners area, San Juan and Rio Ariba Counties of New Mexico, totaling an estimated 90+ Bcf and 20 MMcf/d current production. This production will be sufficient to power 100 MW of the power plant, with the remaining supply to be aggregated from other San Juan producers.  MEVCO Managing Director Phillip Gennarelli noted, ""We are pleased to be involved in this project with Regent. The addition of more producing properties in the area that we bring Regent, coupled with Regent's Horseshoe Gallup holdings, which are in direct proximity with the existing Four Corners Power Plant and the route of the recently announced Sonoran Pipeline venture of Calpine and Kinder Morgan, will provide an unequaled opportunity for both companies.""  Regent President John Ehrman said, ""The additional production from producing properties which MEVCO is assisting Regent in purchasing, currently producing some $1.5 million per month in net operating income, coupled with the additional income through power generation helps Regent to maximize the location of our holdings in relation to the proximity of the existing power plant and transmission lines to key electricity markets in Los Angeles and other western markets. It is a good use of our surface lease, not related to the current proved mineral reserves of the lease.""  The producing oil and properties which MEVCO is assisting Regent in purchasing are in Regent's core area of the Four Corners region near Farmington, NM. Regent will be required to finance the acquisition of the oil and gas proven producing properties under consideration.  Recently, Regent announced that it was in the process of purchasing the interests of all remaining working interest owners in the field, a transaction that is expected to be consummated by the end of the third quarter 2001, giving Regent 100% ownership of the current minerals on the lease.

Subject: Southern Trails Cancels Calif Part of Pipeline Conversion  State Regulations Forces Questar to Cancel Part of Southern Trails  Salt Lake City-based Questar Corp. went out to bid earlier this month on four new compressors to complete its conversion work on the east-of-California portion of its 705-mile Southern Trails Pipeline from the San Juan Basin to the Long Beach port area of Southern California. The portion of the converted oil pipeline between the California border and the Four Corners Area in New Mexico will open June 1 next year, a Questar spokesman said Monday.  It is unlikely the almost 300-mile portion of the former oil pipeline in California will be brought into natural gas service due to state regulatory provisions that make it uneconomic for prospect customers to leave their local supplier for part of their gas supplies. Questar currently is looking for optional uses and a potential buyer for that portion of the project.  Whether any of the pipeline's proposed 110 MMcf/d of supplies gets into California would depend on the takeaway capacity at the border and/or what a new operator on the California side might do with the pipeline, Questar's spokesperson said.

"Hello Kim.  I have attached the index listing all documents that are available in the Data Room.  The only specific items that we would prefer not to copy are the drawings, however, we do have some maps available for you to take.  I spoke to Ned about the dates you had mentioned and unfortunately, next week several key people will be out of town.  At this time November 12 is available - but I need to make sure that our engineers and legal counsel will also be available.  I will let you know as soon as possible.  Please call if you have any further questions.

SoCalGas (Dictation Draft from Greg Porter)    DICTATION DRAFT FROM GREG PORTER   I just spoke with Georgetta Baker, lawyer for SoCalGas, and Rick Miles, FERC's ADR group.  We discussed the possibility of mediation based upon both parties representing in pleadings filed in Docket No. RP01-620 (TW Complaint) that both companies were interested in alternate dispute resolution (ADR).  After discussing the various types of ADR, we agreed to begin with mediation.  Rick Miles will be the mediator.  The mediation process that was discussed was an evolutionary one whereby parties would meet in a neutral location to discuss resolution (i.e., settlement) of its claims.  Both parties indicated a willingness to settle.  Rick Miles will act as a facilitator.  Mr. Miles' function will be one of moderating discussions and not evaluative.  As the mediation process continues without resolution, Mr. Miles' role will evolve.  Later on, if the parties desire, Mr. Miles offered to bring in a FERC staffer that is a subject matter expert to offer his or her views of each party's case.   Also, if the parties desire, the subject matter expert would indicate how he or she would recommend the Commission rule on the merits.  Initial dates of November 7-8 or November 13-14 were offered as potential dates for the first meeting.  A neutral location needs to be agreed upon.  Once additional information is learned, I will advise.  In the meantime, if you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me.",lindy.donoho@enron.com,kimberly.watson@enron.com,FW: TW v.

"James, Would you take a look at this and let us know what you think.  Thanks, Kim  -----Original Message----- From: Proffitt, Robert [mailto:Robert_Proffitt@kindermorgan.com] Sent: Thursday, October 25, 2001 2:03 PM To: Matney, David; McConnell, Mark Cc: Watson, Kimberly Subject: Transpecos   Dave,  Using the numbers we have today and the Pemex volume of 240/day @ $0.25 as we have noted does not get KM to where we would want to be.  I layered on an additional 5 year commitment on the 240/day to cover some of the gap but we were still short of targets.  I then modified the debt term to 20 years which should be acceptable as the project would be supported for that length by the extended term and that covers an additional portion of the gap.   However, we are still short of our target and my calculations indicate a need to have 22/day @ $0.25 starting in year 3 and lasting through year 20 to make up the difference.  In the alternative, a rate of $0.267 with the 20 year term and 20 year debt note also gets us there.  All in all, neither one is that big of a hill to climb so we know what we are looking at.

Shortly after the terrorist attacks of 9/11, I had a meal with Michael Butera. We get together and talk about our spiritual journeys. I find him a most gifted spiritual being. After listening to him for I while, I asked him if he would be willing to come and speak to our Ordinary Life Gathering. He his agreed to do so this Sunday.     His title will be:  ""Fear, What Is It and How to Handle It""     This is what he says about this topic:     ""Finding ourselves alive in an independent form, vulnerable and subject to death, we become frightened, afraid of extinction. This fear is then projected on all our experience. Especially today we may find that our usual consolations are not doing the trick. Like the ""bottom"" reached in an addiction, we will become overwhelmed with our fear or discover that fear is a characteristic that is unnecessary - just as an addict discovers that the object of addiction is not necessary. What a blessed discovery this is.""     Do yourself a spiritual favor and come to hear this spiritual fellow.  Much love,  Bill Kerley  ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++  Ordinary Life is a gathering that provides an opportunity to develop an enlightened heart and an awakened mind to the reality of the present moment.  The gathering meets on Sunday mornings at 9:45 am in Fondren Hall at St. Paul's UMC - 5501 South Main, Houston, Texas and is taught by Dr. Bill Kerley.

They accepted the negotiated rate deal but they are requiring  them to file in their tariff within ONE DAY after the rate has been determined the contract and actual rate. ( Each time the actual rate changes during the term)   Just think about this for the upcoming TW_ USGT deal and NNG""- Reliant deals.    Notwithstanding the time to actually make the filing, the cost to serve it each day if the negotiated rate is different by day and then the service when an order is issued each day---  I believe this is FERC's way to attempt to eliminate negotiated rate indexed based deals-  they are punishing themselves as well, as each filing will require a notice etc-  so every day they could need to issue an order.     I feel we need to discuss with Columbia, INGAA and join in filing for rehearing on this administrative nightmare.  An alternative would be to require you to post on Internet website the day of the transaction the actual rate, so similarly situated customers would have access to the actual rate.

Already I have heard from a number of folks what an outstanding job Michael Butera did yesterday in the Ordinary Life gathering. He always does. It is impossible to provide a summary of what he did. Though he speaks from deep preparation, little of what he says is on paper. There will be a tape available of his presentation.     His topic was fear and how to deal with it. These are certainly fearful times.     This seems to be true on both personal and global levels.     On my own personal level, the eye surgeon discovered scar tissue growing on my retina last week. This is a possible side-effect of the surgeries I've had. If this scar tissue can't be dealt with by medication, I'll have to have more eye surgery.     On our national and global levels, things are out of control.     Let me recommend to you a couple of resources to draw on for these troubling times.     One is a book that you might want to be reading as we continue to speak about our spiritual journey in light of our present national and global context. The book is ""When Things Fall Apart: Heart Advice for Difficult Times"" by Pema Chodron. One of her points is that the very effort to find a safe and secure place is what causes us so much suffering. This book will both challenge and comfort you.     The other resource is to visit a web site where you can find two talks by Thich Nhat Hanh. One is a sermon he gave at Riverside Church right after the 9/11 attacks. The other is an interview he gave entitled ""If I Could Talk With Osama Bin Laden."" You can find all of this at  http://www.plumvillage.org     I look forward to seeing you this coming Sunday.  Much love,  Bill Kerley  ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++  Ordinary Life is a gathering that provides an opportunity to develop an enlightened heart and an awakened mind to the reality of the present moment.  The gathering meets on Sunday mornings at 9:45 am in Fondren Hall at St. Paul's UMC - 5501 South Main, Houston, Texas and is taught by Dr. Bill Kerley.

Electric Business Understanding - November 27 The Electric Business Understanding Seminar will give a basic overview of the electric business for those with limited knowledge of this industry. This seminar is recommended for entry level to mid-level employees in either the gas or electric business or in businesses providing services to these industries.    Understanding Swaps - November 8 & 9 and December 13 & 14 This course is appropriate for all employees wishing to obtain a practical understanding of the basic natural gas and power derivative structures that are traded and marketed today. An emphasis is placed on understanding how financial tools are added to physical structures to meet the risk management needs of clients.  Understanding Options - November 27 & 28 and December 18 & 19 This course builds on our Derivatives 1 program and is appropriate for all employees looking to extend their knowledge of basic derivatives. Swaps and options are revisited, but from a more sophisticated perspective. Option pricing concepts are approached pragmatically, both from the trading and structuring/marketing perspectives. The program does not involve complex mathematics.  Structuring Natural Gas Transactions - November 19 & 20 This course builds on the DI - Applied Energy Derivatives program, focusing on deal structuring opportunities particular to the Natural Gas markets.  Participants will develop insights into the economic inter-relationships between the physical operations (pipelines, storage, generation, etc.) and their synthetic financial counterparts (basis, time spread and multi-fuel derivatives).  Emphasis is directed at identifying marketing opportunities that follow from these concepts.  This is not an introduction to natural gas markets.

Check with Jim Curry - there did seem to be some confusion about the Asset Listing Summary vs. the Asset Listing Detail (that wasn't in the file)  - maybe it is just miss-filed in their stuff.

She said an original document is missig from the data room and was wondering if someone brought it home by mistake.  The missing information is the Dandby section from the Asset Binder.  It had a grey card-stock cover.  We can certainly keep a copy but they need the original back.  With all of the paper floating around the tables, it is likely to have been mixed up with some copies that were given to us.  Anyway, please check your stuff and see if this got in there.  Also, the late copies she was making for us (including the stuff from Colleen) will be mailed overnight to Kim on Friday.  We'll get the information passed out when we get it.

We've been on team reviews for the last couple of weeks, doing reviews during the day and traveling to next location. I agree that we should approach them from the Special Service side. At this time we have our yearly meeting set up for Nov. 12th but this could change. Todd Stubbs is ready but Bob Checketts is having problems scheduling this week. He's tied up on a security task force for their company. Todd should let me know this week if we're still on for the 12th.  Lindy do you or someone else plan to attend the meeting? If not I'll plan to visit with Todd and see how he reacts to the facility upgrade if that's OK with everyone.

Lee, could you please review the same and see if you agree with this assessment?  It appears to me that the pigging facilties could qualify as either of the following:  Special Services.  This would be subject to prior written consent and agreement between the Operator (TW) and the Operating Committee (TW & NWPLRepresentatives).  If NWPL agreed, their share of the cost would be in proportion to their ownership interest.  If we did obtain their approval, future O&M cost attributable to the pigging facilities could be shared among the owners.  (We've agreed to a flat fee for 2000 through 2003 with a 3.5% escalator starting in 2001.)   Addition or Expansion.  Demonstrate that the pigging will add incremental transmission capacity. We have to give notice to NWPL and they have 60 days to participate.  If they participate, they share in the cost at their ownership interest, but they get a share of the incremental capacity at their ownership interest.  If they don't indicate a desire to participate in 60 days, we can proceed with the Expansion (without any approval, but also no cost sharing).  Also, any incremental O&M associated with an expansion cannot be passed on to any owners not participating in such expansion.  I think if we went the Special Services route, we would need to justify the need for these facilities to maintain the integrity and efficiency of the facilities at current levels.  I think we would spend alot of time arguing this with them and in the end they would probably approve it subject to them not incurring any cost.  (They probably don't have $260,000 ($1.5MM * .174) sitting around in a budget somewhere that they'd like to fork over for these facilities.)  Rich, what do you think?  How difficult would it be to demonstrate that these facilities are necessary for maintaining the current operating levels of the facilities?  Recommendation:  To save us the 60 days notice period of an Expansion, I think we should notify them that it's a necessary Special Service and ask for approval (& to pass along their share of the cost), but to be prepared to eat 100% of the costs to obtain their timely approval and proceed with the installation of the facilities.  In this event we would need to agree on the inclusion of future O&M attributable to these facilities.  FYI, their ownership interest is still officially 22.3% since they have not executed the Amendment that has been tendered to them 3 times, first by me and twice by Lynn Blair.  If they execute the Amendment that incorporates the 4/1/98 expansion of the facilities, their ownership interest will be 17.4%.

JTW.  -----Original Message----- From: Bill@bkspeaks.com [mailto:Bill@bkspeaks.com] Sent: Wednesday, November 07, 2001 11:07 AM To: ordinarylife@yahoogroups.com Subject: [ordinarylife] Summary for November 4, 2001   ORDINARY LIFE - Thoughts and Ideas to Help You Live a Happier Life  ====================================== Summary of November 4, 2001 ======================================  Dear Folks ?     This Sunday's Ordinary Life gathering continued to focus on a spiritual response to the days following the events of 9/11 and following.    One of the questions people are raising is: What can we do to be safe? This presentation responds to that question.     I shared with you how we realize what we visualize.    It is important to know the role and use of myth, magic and ritual in our lives.    The key to released power for our time and lives is in personal responsibility.    It is also important to know the principle of cause and effect.    We are constantly tempted to forget that life is a gift, that no one is special, and that change can occur only at the conscious level.    This presentation also included the principles of ""mind and spirit"" we can use to meet our moral obligation to be happy.  ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++         Full text of the presentation  ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++        Dancing in Difficult Times  ======================================     The title of my talk with you today is ""Dancing During Difficult Times.""     These are those are they not? At least it seems so. We are assaulted by news we don't want to hear and yet if we don't pay some attention we may not know how to be alert.     I practice my own preaching at this point. I never listen to the news or look at the paper until after I meditate in the morning. I believe what the publication ""The Onion"" advised investors when the market dropped can apply to a multitude of matters. They said, ""Investors are advised to remain calm, and leave the panic to the professionals."" But even after meditating, when I pick up the New York Times, it chills me. What's next? Is there any way to be safe?     I was interviewed for the ten o'clock news Friday night for the NBC affiliate here. The interview lasted twenty minutes. Twenty seconds got on the air. During the interview the reporter asked me what I thought people needed to do to deal with their fear and stay safe during this time. I said, ""Don't smoke and wear your seat belt.""     The fact is that far more people die on a regular basis as a result of cigarette smoking and car accidents than die as a result of the terror we read about in the paper. I tried to find out exactly how many by doing a web search but only turned up finds of personal injury attorneys pleading for your business if you've been in a car accident.     I think God needs a good lawyer. There are all these crackpots out there doing hateful things in God's name. I think God's lawyer should go after them for libel, slander, defamation of character and more. If you read any of God's books, you won't find God counseling people to harm the innocent. That is simply not God's desire.     I think it was Lily Tomlin who noted that if you talk to God, that's called praying. But if God talks to you, that's schizophrenia. For anyone to claim that God has told them to do something contrary to God's will of love is nuts.     I am asked on a very regular basis by lots of people how do deal with anxiety during these troubled times. So one answer is to keep a perspective.     In 2000, there were 6,394,000 police reported motor vehicle crashes, an increase of 0.2 percent from 1999.  41,821 people were killed. 3,189,000 people were injured. An average of 115 persons died each day in 2000? one every 13 minutes. That is more enough than to fill a 747 jumbo jet every single week.     Let me offer you a perspective on something else. I frequently get responses from folks - some in person and many by e-mail - about the value of our gatherings for you. I'm so glad. But listen to this:     I used to have a play a game as a child. It was a game I used to play with my cousins. We called it ""playing church."" Yes, we also played ""doctor"" but my parents made us quit when my cousin tried to take out a neighbor child's appendix. Church was one of our favorite games. We would gather in my grandmother's living room where there was a grand piano and pick parts. Someone would be the ""teacher"" of the make-believe Sunday school class, someone would be the pianist, someone would be the song director, etc. Now, I promise you, I never had a sane/conscious desire to be a parish minister. But notice that is where, in part, where I've ended up.     Just this week I had a memory of that childhood playtime and a realization that I'm living that dream. What that caused to occur in me is such a deep gratitude for you. If it weren't for you, I couldn't do this. No matter what happens in here in our times together, I am the one who is most deeply benefited. So I thank you so much that you make it possible for my unconscious dream to be true.     So there is one principle right there is it not? What we visualize is what we realize.     The principles I am trying to teach, the method of being I want to use in my life and present to you, are things I've been trying to get into my head and heart and hands for at least the past thirty years. They are so simple and yet we never fully master them. The good news is that we have the rest of our lives to do that - no matter how long or short that might be.     I experience life in some of the same ways that I think you do too. For example, I frequently stray far off the path of what I teach. I assume you do too. I can fall for the culture's notion about security. You know, we begin to believe that there is something we can do to stay safe.     My eye condition has been a great teacher for me at this point. One day out of the blue I began to have these flashers in my left eye. Each time I had surgery, I was confident I was on the other side of the difficulty. Surely, I thought, things would get back to normal. But the surgery failed. I had another one. It failed. Another one. Then two Sundays ago, more flashers. An emergency session with the surgeon on Monday revealed scar tissue forming on the retina causing the retina to bunch up in that place and thus tug at the edges of the retina risking more tears and a resulting detachment. I sat there dumbfounded as the surgeon informed me that there is nothing that can be done about this. Just wait and see what happens. It will either go away or it won't. Ah, the lesson of patience. Though I confess, I'm kind of tired of attending this particular class held by my eye. Mother Teresa once said, ""I know God never gives me more than I can handle, but sometimes I wish He didn't have so much confidence in me.""     One of the ways that we can more successfully move through these days of our lives is to pay careful attention to the role of myth, magic and ritual in our lives. Every week across the street we act out a great ritual. And it itself is in the context of a great ritual and mythic story. We will begin, in a few weeks, this mythic story all over again - the first Sunday in Advent will lead us day by day all the way to the greatness of Easter morning and the Pentecost celebration that follows fifty days after that.     We go over this myth year after year. Not because we don't know it but because we draw strength from participating in it. It doesn't change but our understanding of it does, our lives change, our circumstances change.     Just so with the principles of Ordinary Life. If we don't have ways to remind us of the principles of Ordinary Life, we'll drift away and become very frightened or cynical or lost.     In our society there are notions that function as gods that lead us far astray from who we really are and what life is really about. Money is one of our gods, isn't it? Status can be? And there are many others.     Our task is to dethrone these things and learn how life really works and make what we learn help us create the life we want and want the life we have. We are not what we do. We are not what we have. Life is in our being.     Another way of stating this is that we create the world we live in by our beliefs. The world-view we hold is responsible for the quality of our lives. We are responsible for the content of our lives. No terrorist is responsible for the content of my life. I am one hundred percent responsible. This is the key to released power. The understanding you have of your world is your religion.     These are not comfortable teachings for us. Why is that? Well, the fundamental bottom line reason is that if we look at life as it is we have to face up to our death and that is just too much. Don't worry, I'm not going there - right now.     For the moment, let's think about cause and effect and see if we can use this principle to help us live the principle of our having a moral obligation to be happy even though we are assaulted by news we don't want to hear about terrorist attacks, anthrax and all that jazz.     The law of cause and effect means: This is this way because that is that way.     Cause and effect means that everything is connected to everything.     When you are working with this principle, it is critically important to practice non-judgment.     Most of us have some notion of what it would mean to live heroically in the face of whatever life has to dish out to us. Right? We know of people like Helen Keller or Ann Frank who lived their lives in the midst of and in spite of difficult times. So, we know what heroic living looks like.     But notice also how easy it is for us to fall off the path.     When I was at Harvard there was a prayer we prayed: ""Dear God, deliver me from the sin of intellectual pride - which, for your information means . . .""     It is so easy to fall off the path. And, also notice, the consequences when we do. Let's look at some truths about life and how quickly and easily we can move away from them.     For example:     Life is a gift but we live as if we had to work to earn it.     None of us is special but we live lives of intense competition.     The only way you can change your life is at the consciousness level but we act like we can change it at the material level through what we have and/or do.     Get this: What you are about is love. There is no way you can be about something else. You are created in the image of love. You can withhold love or distort it but you can't get away from it.     I've been using the phrase ""principle of equality"" in my teachings with you lately. If we come at life, if we come at other nations, if we come at our relationships committed to inequality, we are not going to experience life. But we learn the principle of inequality early. One of you sent me this -     ""Just had to email you this before I forgot.    ""Today in the last service there was a little boy sitting behind me with his parents. He must have been about 4 or 5 yrs old. During the baptism, he says in a startled voice (trying to whisper... but not quite managing to): 'Oh my gosh! That is a real live baby up there! I didn't know they let babies into church. They don't know 'nuthin!'    ""I had to grin. If he only knew that is why the rest of us are here. ;-)""     Often we try to practice our spiritual principles when it is comfortable and convenient for us. But when a tragedy strikes we revert to defensive and reactionary beliefs and behaviors. You cannot ride two horses with one behind. Otherwise you are going to get real sore. You will become known as what is called - a lost soul.     I have found a ton of help in Buddhist psychology and practices. Whatever your religious beliefs are, I believe, this can be true for you too. One of the things I've learned by investigating this territory is that there are principles that accurately describe the way life works. If we know these and live them, we will be happier people. We will have more of the life we want.     When, years ago, I first tried to translate these principles into my own life and language, the way I worded them was like this.     1. What we believe creates the world we live in. All that we accomplish with our lives is a direct result of our thoughts. We are what we think and our character is the complete sum of our thoughts. Individual responsibility for this must be absolute.     This is the way Buddha put it -     ""The thought manifests as the word.     The word manifests as the deed.     The deed develops into habit.     And habit hardens into character.     So watch the thought and its ways with care.     And let it spring from love,     Born out of concern for all being.""     2. By and large we get in life what we expect to get.     3. We have a tendency to attract into our lives those events and experiences that harmonize with out dominant belief systems.     If I were to ask you to go into the next room and count all of the blue things you see, I'm sure you could do that. You could come back and report some number of your counting. But, then, if I were to ask you, ""While you were in there, how many brown things did you see?"" your report would be non-existent or not accurate because brown is not what you were looking for. This is called sorting. What do you sort for? We do this also by the questions we ask ourselves every morning as we are beginning our day.     4. What we dwell on grows in our experience. This says something about the importance of meditation and prayer.     5. You can hold only one thought at a time. If you don't like what is in your mind, replace it, substitute it with something else. This is the principle of substitution.     6. Then there is the principle of work or practice. I talked to the reporter about the importance of being present. She thought for a moment and said, ""That's very hard to do. How do you learn to do it?"" My response: ""Like learning any other skill: You practice.""     I don't know a thing in the world worth doing that doesn't take practice and work.     When the first astronauts made it to the moon and were walking about, one of them said, ""This seems like old home week."" What did that mean? It meant that they had practiced that walk so much in simulation that it seemed familiar to them.     7. Relaxation and play. This is one of the most important needs of the Self, of the soul. We are, in different many ways, to practice a ""Sabbath"" in our lives. So many of us don't. We just work, work, work. ""Play,"" by the way, doesn't mean the competitive combat so many engage in and ""rest"" doesn't mean sleeping and napping.     One of the biggest causes that keeps people from finding satisfaction in life is playing into the victim mentality. The victim mentality, simply defined, is that outlook or attitude that says, ""My life is essentially at the mercy of vast powerful forces out there and beyond my control. Therefore, I am at the mercy of:     - My history, my upbringing, my genes, my heritage.    - My social class, my education (or lack of it), or my IQ (or lack of it.)    - My parents, my teachers, or an invalid relative.    - My mate, my partner.    - My boss, my supervisor, my manager, or my co-workers.    - The economy, the times we live in, the social structure, or our form of government.    - The politicians, the large corporations, or the rich.    - Some particular enemy, who is out to get me, and who has great power.     The Victim Mentality ultimately discharges you from any responsibility for your life, since clearly what is happening to you is not your fault.     I'm not saying there are no victims. Let a good hurricane occur around here and folks are made victims quickly.     But there is a vast difference between being a victim and having a victim mentality. One means dealing heroically with what you have to deal with and the other means giving up. I believe each one of us always has more control over our lives than we think is the case. No matter how much of our life we see as unchangeable, there is always that part that is under our control and that we can work on to change. Even if it is only 2%, it is almost always more than we think.     Although we work in some predictable ways, almost machine like, we're not machines. You can cut a machine off. What you believe, however, continually does something with the energy that is going through you. If you are afraid of losing your job, if you are afraid of losing your mate, if you are afraid there will never be a ""Mr. not-so- wrong"" for you, guess what? The universe is going to support you in having those be your life experiences.     Here is something I have mentioned to you before but it fits again in this context. There is a risk we need to keep in our minds. We have parts of our lives we are not clear about. Affecting this lack of clarity are forces in our society, powerful forces, that are focused on us all the time. These are in the form of television, radio, newspapers, magazines, sales-persons, employers, relatives, and friends. They have many ideas about what we should be thinking. When we avoid making clear decisions about what is best for us, we tend to adopt the ideas of these other sources, without even being aware that we are doing it.     It is like your being is a sponge. You can fill the sponge with love, forgiveness, peace, confidence, abundance, affirmation, gratitude, and joy. OR, we can leave the sponge partly dry and the world will fill it for us. That's why we need to practice a way that keeps the quality of life experience we want for ourselves in our consciousness. That's our choice. When we don't make it, someone else will make it for us.     Okay. What might be a practical application of this? If these principles are true and if the ultimate nature of all that is is love, then, how are we to live?     I believe we are more in alignment with the purpose for our lives when we are experiencing and expressing the following:    Love,     peace,      forgiveness,       confidence (hope),        abundance,         affirmation (faith),          gratitude, and           joy and happiness.     Whatever your specific purpose is, these states of being fit your basic purpose in life.     So, here is the process.     First, we look around and notice what is.     Second, we accept it - without judgment of any kind. This sometimes requires practice. The skill you are practicing here is forgiveness. Or, the principle of 100% responsibility.     Until we learn to bring mindfulness to every aspect of our lives, a stance of mindfulness all the time, everywhere - we are in hell. If you wait for the circumstances of your life to change before you develop mindfulness, you'll never get there. We can easily fall into being dependent on others without even realizing it.     It was autumn, and the Indians on the remote reservation asked their new Chief if the winter was going to be cold or mild.    Since he was an Indian Chief in a modern society, he had never been taught the old secrets, and when he looked at the sky, he couldn't tell what the weather was going to be. Nevertheless, to be on the safe side, he replied to his tribe that the winter was indeed going to be cold and that the members of the village should collect wood to be prepared.    But also being a practical leader, after several days he got an idea. He went to the phone booth, called the National Weather Service and asked, ""Is the coming winter going to be cold?""    ""It looks like this winter is going to be quite cold indeed,"" the meteorologist at the weather service responded.    So the Chief went back to his people and told them to collect even more wood in order to be prepared.    A week later, he called the National Weather Service again. ""Is it going to be a very cold winter?""    ""Yes,"" the man at National Weather Service again replied, ""it's definitely going to be a very cold winter.""    The Chief again went back to his people and ordered them to collect every scrap of wood they could find.    Two weeks later, he called the National Weather Service again. ""Are you absolutely sure that the winter is going to be very cold?""    ""Absolutely,"" the man replied. ""It's going to be one of the coldest winters ever.""    ""How can you be so sure?"" the Chief asked.    The weatherman replied, ""The Indians are collecting wood like crazy.""     Then, third, you practice experiencing and/or expressing one of the states of being that reflects your spiritual beliefs.     Let me give you an example one of you offered me.     Recently Dr. Bob Bell visited Istanbul. You might remember that he made comments in here about his visit to a mosque there. After returning to Houston, he wrote the following letter to their tour guide:     ""We want to thank you so much for your kindness, patience, charm, and wit while putting up with us. We arrived back in Houston, Texas, without incident on October 10th.    ""Our country continues to be traumatized and anxious. Now it is Anthrax that has us in a panic. We have had things too easy for too long over here. This may be God's wake up call to us and we are finding it difficult to accept.    ""In church this morning, we read the following from Paul's second letter to Timothy (New Testament - Christian Bible). This is a portion: 'For the time is coming when people will not put up with sound doctrine, but having itching ears, they will accumulate for themselves teachers to suit their own desires, and will turn away from listening to the truth and wander away to myths. As for you, always be sober, endure suffering, do the work of an evangelist, carry out your ministry fully.'    ""I think this applies to both of our faiths and I encourage you and all others to live your religion fully and with a burning devotion. Together we will defeat this thing and come out stronger and closer in our love for each other. We will not have another 'Crusade.' We ride together this time. May God/Allah/Yahweh richly bless us all.""     There is a rhythm to this dance. The first step is made as quickly as possible. The second may take a bit longer if there is homework to do. We want to make the third one last as long as possible.     Think about it: If you learn to be present, the dance takes place all by itself. You are aware of the flowing feelings within you starting with love. I love so much about and within life. From that love flows a sense anguish and despair when I realize that I can't hold on to anything or anyone I love. That is followed by a sense of wonder and awe that I have been permitted to participate in any of it. What flows from that is a sense of victory and triumph. And from that a sense of joy. And from that joy a sense of awe at the wonder of it all. Which ends up leading me once again to love. Which causes the dance to start all over again. That's the flow. Our job is to learn to celebrate every aspect of it.     Let me read you an embodiment of this in a recent message from the Hopi Elders:     ""You have been telling the people that this is the Eleventh Hour.    Now you must go back and tell the people that this is the Hour.    And there are things to be considered:    Where are you living?    What are you doing?    What are your relationships?    Are you in right relation?    Where is your water?    Know your garden.    It is time to speak your Truth.    Create your community.    Be good to each other.    And do not look outside yourself for the leader.    This could be a good time!    There is a river flowing now very fast.    It is so great and swift that there are those who will be afraid.    They will try to hold on to the shore.    They will feel they are being torn apart, and they will suffer greatly.    Know the river has its destination.    The elders say we must let go of the shore, push off into the middle of the river, keep our eyes open, and our heads above the water.    See who is in there with you and celebrate.    At this time in history, we are to take nothing personally.    Least of all, ourselves.    For the moment that we do, our spiritual growth and journey comes to a halt. The time of the lone wolf is over. Gather yourselves!    Banish the word struggle from your attitude and your vocabulary.    All that we do now must be done in a sacred manner and in celebration.    We are the ones we've been waiting for.""    The Elders    Oraibi, Arizona Hopi Nation""     No matter where you go this week, no matter what happens, remember this: You are carrying precious cargo.

It isn't about attempting to get someplace - like to security.     These matters, and others, are by-products of our willingness to  give up trying to transcend ordinary life and simply to be with life as  it is.     When we gather this week, I want to talk with you - in light of what  we have been discussing - about the principle of ""sacred unity.""     Think about this: In his ministry Jesus was constantly inviting all  sorts and conditions of people to him. He ate and drank with all kinds  of people. He excluded no one. He was enacting the principle of sacred  unity. In fact, this got him into far more trouble than any claim he  ever made about himself.     What might it mean for us to practice the principle of sacred unity  in both the outer world and in our inner life?     Whoever you are, whatever your condition I invite you to include  yourself when the Ordinary Life gathering meets this week.     I look forward to seeing you and being with you.

JW.  -----Original Message----- From: Bill@bkspeaks.com [mailto:Bill@bkspeaks.com] Sent: Monday, November 12, 2001 1:16 PM To: ordinarylife@yahoogroups.com Subject: [ordinarylife] Summary of November 11, 2001   ORDINARY LIFE - Thoughts and Ideas to Help You Live a Happier Life  ======================================  Summary of November 11, 2001  ======================================  Dear Folks ?       The Principle of Just Noticing     One of the fastest ways out of the fear that our current global crisis can cause in us is to develop the skill of ""just noticing"" what our reaction of life is. When we fail to notice what is we miss life as it is. We do this because we try to make ourselves safe and secure - especially from death. Just noticing is build on the principle of ""sacred unity.""  ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++         Full text of presentation     I'm calling the remarks I want to make with you today ""Just Noticing.""     We are attempting to learn how to be with the world as it is. And with ourselves as we are.     These are big tasks because the world as it is currently a scary place with an uncertain future. And we as we are turn out to be a mixed bag, some of which is hard to accept.     Last week I introduced you to what are, at least for me, some key concepts.     First, were the principles of mind and spirit.    Second, the process of learning to make life work for us in a way that fits the goal of ""living the life we want and wanting the life we live."" Some of you have wondered: ""Is it really possible to do this? Can we really love and accept ourselves and each other unconditionally?""     One very important spiritual skill is learning just to notice.     Just be with what is.     Yes, this is difficult to do with no judgment. But it is one of our primary spiritual tasks. If we cannot learn to relate to ourselves this way, we cannot relate to others with kindness or compassion either.     Several years ago a man walked into a bar in San Francisco near the waterfront. After he had ordered his drink, he noticed that the man sitting next to him looked like a sea-going pirate. Not only was he dressed the part but he had a peg-leg, a hook instead of a hand and he had a patch over one eye.    Curiosity got the better of him so he asked the man to tell him about himself.    ""Excuse me, but you look like a pirate.""    ""Aye mate, that I was. A true sea-going pirate.""    ""My but you must have had an interesting life judging from the looks of things.""    ""Aye lad, that I have.""    ""Do you mind telling about your adventures? For example, how did you come to have a peg-leg?""    ""Well, I was a pirate you know. One day a huge wave came and knocked me off the ship and a shark bit my leg clean off. That's why I have a peg-leg.""    ""And your arm? How did you come by that hook?""    ""Well, I was a pirate you know. One night in a bar in Singapore I got in a fight and this guy took a machete and cut my arm clean off. That's how I got my hook.""    ""And how about your eye? How did you lose your eye?""    ""Well, I was a pirate you know. One day while up on deck I happened to look up and a sea gull pooped in my eye?""    ""A sea gull pooped in your eye and that's how you lost your eye?""    ""Well, it was the day after I got my hook.""     There is a profound wisdom in learning to be with life as it is. Something happens and immediately we react rather than just noticing. When we do that we can blind ourselves. So often we want to escape life. What I want our times together to help us all do is to develop a loving and compassionate relationship toward life as it is and toward ourselves as we really are.     One way to talk about this is with the phrase ""just noticing."" The foundation of this ""noticing"" is the principle of spiritual unity.     When Jesus used the word ""God,"" the word that he used in Aramaic means ""that which encompasses everything both outside and inside.""     This includes those things we label ""good"" and those things we label ""bad."" Both within the world and within ourselves. This is one of the reasons we are encouraged to know ourselves as completely as possible. You can't love what you don't know or know what you don't love.     Jesus was constantly inviting people toward himself in one way or another. Indeed, I think one of the true marks of the spiritual life- style I would aspire to is that it be one that is inviting. I would like for people to find what we are up to in here, for example, to be intriguing, appealing, etc.     ""Come, follow me,"" he said.     ""Come and see what I have found,"" said his followers.     So Jesus embraced and invited everyone. Indeed, his hanging out with sinners, prostitutes and drunks - his inclusiveness if you will - got him into far more trouble than anything he ever said about himself.     This is a manifestation of the Jewish principle of wisdom, called ""Sophia."" In the Old Testament book of Proverbs you find Wisdom gathering various guests together.     At the time of Jesus there were very strict rules in Judaism about whom you could eat with and whom you couldn't and he regularly and deliberately disobeyed those rules. By violating these rules Jesus modeled the nature of God's love. God invites and includes all.     The word Jesus used for ""God,"" means ""no boundaries."" No one and nothing is excluded. So our spiritual work involves attempting to create our lives in light of this reality.     Of course, the phrases ""being with life as it is"" and ""learning to embrace it all"" are what we talk about all the time in here in one way or another.     Here is a promise: the more you work with not running from the things that scare you - whether within or without - and the more you and I don't try to sidestep the feelings of insecurity that facing these demons brings us, the more we will be at peace; the more joy we will experience; the happier we will be.     It is that simple.     It is that difficult.     Of course, the bottom line thing we try to run from and escape is ? death.     Once I had a very profound dream. It was disturbing beyond belief. I would say that paying attention to and honoring this dream saved my life. And by ""saved my life"" I don't mean it in the way we usually do. It didn't keep me safe and secure.     I dreamed that I was back in Columbia, Tennessee the town where I lived from age six until age seventeen or eighteen. I had gone back there because I had some sort of business to conduct with the undertaker. (You understand that we take nothing in a dream as literal. Dream symbols are much more serious than that.) While I was waiting for the undertaker to finish whatever he was doing and come to our meeting, I was looking around this place. Off of the vestibule where I stood waiting, there were numerous visitation rooms. Each seemed to have several caskets in it. Each casket contained a corpse.     I looked over to the room on my right and there was a casket in which the body in it seemed to be breathing. I walked over to it and there, plain as day, was my dad. All laid out but clearly not dead. He was breathing!     Now, in the dream I had no emotional reaction to this whatsoever. I just noticed it. I went back to the vestibule to wait.     Soon the undertaker came out.     He had on a white lab coat with blood stains on it. Blood in dreams always refers to sacrifice. (We don't like to make sacrifices!)     I said to him, ""Before we get down to business, I thought you might like to know that the body in that casket over there isn't dead.""     ""Oh yes, we know. He is about to die. You see, he is afraid of the pain of the process of being embalmed. We're keeping an eye on him. As soon as he is dead, we are going to close the casket and bury him.""     That seemed to make sense to me so I said, ""Okay"" and we got about our business - which I have no idea what it was.     When I woke, the dream seemed like it had been so real. I was very disturbed by it. Remember, there are no bad dreams - just disturbing ones. What could it possibly mean?     I worked with that dream for weeks. What in me was afraid of dying? Of the process of being embalmed?     The ego.     The ego thinks it is the whole show and is terrified about having the life sucked out of it.     This is why I say to you that the spiritual practice I am attempting to teach in here has nothing to do with believing anything religious - at least not at first. It has most of all to do with our being willing to die and to do this dying on a continuous basis.     Just when we are sure that we've found the truth, that we have a place to stand, that we are safe and secure; life as it is - or God - comes along and says, ""Let that go!""     Sometimes this command is whispered to us and is so subtle we miss it if we aren't careful. Sometimes it is yelled so loudly in our ears that it echoes there for a long, long time.     This is why I have cautioned you about the danger of putting labels on anything.     For example:    ""I'm married."" Then my spouse leaves by death or divorce.    ""I'm wealthy."" Then the market crashes.    ""I'm young and healthy."" ""What do you mean it's malignant?    ""I'm a safe and secure citizen of the United States of America."" Then comes along 9/11.     Almost nowhere do we get taught the folly of running away from that which scares us. Instead we are taught to cover it up, make the bitter sweet, smooth it over so no one will pay attention, take a pill, distract yourself and don't think about it. By all means, by any means make it go away.     The saddest thing about how we are taught to deal with the fear we have of the various deaths we need to face is that each and every method causes us to cheat ourselves out of being in the present moment.     Pema Chodron in her wonderful book ""When Things Fall Apart: Heart Advice for Difficult Times"" talks about the wisdom of being nailed to the present moment. I thought, when I first read that phrase, of one who was willing to be so nailed and the powerful impact he had because of that willingness.     One of the negative contributions organized religion has made to our lives is that it tries to organize things. Which, of course, it must. But organized religion begins to create God in its image. Each religious group becomes so certain of what it is that God wants and believes.     But you notice that what God wants and believes varies from group to group. You get the suspicion that the beliefs have been shaped to support and affirm the religious organization's existence and culture. I have a suspicion that this is one of the leading causes of atheism.     The spiritual path I am attempting to apprehend and talk about isn't about getting someplace - at least not the place that organized religion talks about. We're not trying to get to heaven or be ""right.""     I grew up, as did some of you, in a church that emphasized the importance of ""being saved.""     To this day when I go to visit my Dad in Columbia, Tennessee - where that funeral home is - if I go to church with my dad, the service is just like it was when I was a child. There is almost no one in that church under fifty. My dad is 93. Yet, every sermon and every service is focused on the unsaved.     A phrase that some folks used briefly after 9/11 ""when will things get back to normal. ""Normal"" is one of the most useless words in our vocabulary. Things are not normal - except in this sense: Things come together and they fall apart. Then they come together again. Then they fall apart again. This is the way of ordinary life. Our healing lies in creating room for this sort of thing to happen. Room to love. Then to grief. Then to feel relief. Then misery and joy that frees us to love again and start the process all over again.     Do you see why I say that the spiritual journey isn't about getting it together or getting to heaven? In fact, looking for a secure safe place is what keeps us miserable.     Just noticing what is going on right here and now and what our reaction to it is, this noticing becomes our teacher. That's what meditation is about. Learning to notice. We don't meditate in order to become good meditators. We meditate so that we will wake up. If someone were to ask me, ""How long does this take?"" my answer would be: ""The rest of our lives.""     Many people are out seeking for some special religious and/or spiritual path to take them to bliss. All sorts of things are available for that. Some try the drug Ecstasy. Some try weekend workshops of all sorts. Some go off and follow someone who can channel a long dead person into the present moment. These dead folks always seem to be so wise. Are there no dead jerks? And on and on. All these are efforts to transcend life as it is. My assertion is that it is only when we are willing to be with ordinary life that we are free to really to live.     You see, as long as I am pre-occupied with the hope that there is somewhere else that is better to be or that there is someone else better to be, I'm not able to be with where I am and who I am right here, right now.     I remember when I first heard the notion that suffering doesn't mean that something is wrong. What a relief! Suffering is part of life. Life is difficult. We don't suffer because we've done something wrong or weren't good enough. To believe that is spiritual poverty. Spiritual poverty is always experiencing ""I'm not good enough or haven't done enough; that there is something missing in me.""     I strongly believe that our efforts to protect ourselves from sorrow and hardship are not being kind to ourselves. We get taught in this culture on the importance of getting it all together and feeling good. So that if we are experiencing an upset of some kind, we think that something is wrong and we have to get it fixed. When we take this approach, we inevitably become bitter, hardened, unavailable, fearful and alienated. In our effort to avoid sorrow and hardship we end up living tensely - it's like living your whole life in the dentist chair.     When we suffer, it doesn't mean something is wrong.     If you had a child or best friend who felt that that they were inadequate or fundamentally flawed, what you would do is put your arms around them and say, ""No, you are fine, just the way you are."" Then you might help the child or your friend explore why they felt so bad. Understand? We can explore the nature of our feeling inadequate without believing that we are inadequate.     [At the point each person in the Ordinary Life Gathering was given a raisin. We spent time ""just noticing"" the raisin.]     Now a raisin is a small thing. But what if it is your spouse or partner that you are not noticing? What if it is your health? What if it is your surroundings?     One of the first things I learned when I began to do sitting meditation is how much time I spend not in the moment. Rather I am busy planning, thinking about the next item on my ""to do list,"" how I'm going to get done all I have scheduled for myself. One main goal of spiritual practice is just to notice.     These are dark times. Learning to notice and then practicing loving- kindness and compassion toward ourselves is as good a way as I know for us to start turning lights on in the darkness so that we and others can see.     No matter where you go this week, no matter what happens, remember this: You are carrying precious cargo.

Lay's employment agreement with Enron, which is set to expire Dec. 31, 2005, allows the executive to terminate his employment with the company 60 days prior to the Dynegy merger and receive a lump-sum payment of up to $80.8 million, according to a regulatory filing Tuesday.   <http://cbs.marketwatch.com/tools/quotes/intchart.asp?symb=ENE>  According to the terms of the employment contract, if Lay quits before a change of control at the company, he is entitled to a lump sum payment equal to the number of years left in his contract multiplied by $20.2 million.  The agreement also allots an amount to Lay for any tax-related penalties if the lump-sum payment is held to constitute an ""excess parachute payment,"" according to the Securities and Exchange Commission filing.  Lay's original employment agreement with Enron was amended in August when he became CEO after Jeff Skilling resigned.  Enron's ( ENE <http://cbs.marketwatch.com/tools/quotes/detail.asp?view=detail&symb=ENE>) shares fell 4 cents to $9.20 in recent trading.

Below is my reply.  Please let me know if you have any comments.  Paul, please provide the dollar amount needed in the blank below. ______________________________________________________________--  Rob,  After reviewing the current status of United States Gypsum Company and Transwestern's status as a creditor of Administrative Claims, we will not proceed in seeking the additional $___________ letter of credit (worth approximately 8 months of reservation charges).  The current letter of credit valued at $__________ is sufficient.  Also, our timing for the completion of the Red Rock Expansion that will make this capacity available is still on schedule for June 1, 2002.  In our latest discussions with SOCAL, they have indicated that their expansion of the SOCAL Needles delivery point will be completed by that time.

"Paula,  I can make myself available this evening or tomorrow evening to discuss this and other topics as your calendar permits.  I actually think that we should not be pressured by anyone to fill this position in the next few days.  If Jim would like to resign effective the end of the month (or some other date), I think that would be fine.  It is completely reasonable that the board take some amount of time, whatever is necessary, to select the right candidate.  Let me know when you would like to rally.  Thanks, Kim.  P.S.

In instances where SoCal happens to call their OFO in the Intraday 2 cycle, it can cause Transwestern to have Shipper imbalances because we do not have an opportunity to pass-along these reductions to our upstream parties.  We think we would like to file a letter that may mention our general support of the ""direction"" of SoCal's changes, but that we do have an issue that has developed since actual implementation that we are currently working on with them.  Lynn & I worked on this rough general description we thought could be incorporated into a brief letter.     ""If SoCal calls an OFO in the Intraday 2 Cycle, an allocation is passed to Transwestern through the confirmation process with SoCal.  Due to the timing of these OFO's, Transwestern is unable to confirm such reductions with Transwestern's upstream parties.""

The purpose of this filing is to  describe the new internal receipt point operating procedures that SoCalGas is  implementing, and to request Commission authorization to include the revised  operating procedures in Rule 30. SoCalGas says this step is being taken in  anticipation that it will be replaced with a system of firm tradable intrastate  transmission rights in Gas Industry Restructuring (GIR) proceeding, I.99-07-003.   During  the GIR panel hearings, several parties requested that SoCalGas publish its  windowing criteria in tariffs to facilitate a better understanding of the method  used to allocate receipt point  capacity.  SoCalGas agreed to make  such a filing, and D.99-07-015 directed SoCalGas to file an advice letter adding  windowing information to its tariffs.  To comply with this directive, on August  6, 1999, SoCalGas filed AL2837, which has not been acted on by the Commission.   Customer complaints about SoCalGas' windowing  procedures have convinced SoCalGas that it should replace its internal  windowing operating procedures with a system that is open to the maximum  operating capacity at each SoCalGas receipt point.  SoCalGas is making these internal  operating changes effective November 1, 2001.  SoCalGas held meetings with upstream  pipelines on October 17, and with interested customers and stakeholders on  October 18, regarding the upcoming changes.  They were invited to ask any questions in  the days leading up to the meetings.  Comments and/or protests are due on November 21.  Have a good  weekend! Dan   Law Offices of Daniel W.

I hope this helps clear the issue=  up or at least provides enough information to allow you all to understand = the concept... thanks  As usual this is pretty far fetched....  ---------------------- Forwarded by David Roensch/ET&S/Enron on 11/16/2001 = 03:21 PM ---------------------------   David Roensch 11/16/2001 01:46 PM To:=09Norm Spalding/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT cc:=09=20  Subject:=09FW: TW Waste Heat Recovery Projects  Sorry to be late with a response back but, I wanted to run a few things dow= n before getting back with you and explaining why I was really so intereste= d in this project.  After visiting with you in the field this week you aske= d that I jot some of this down so this will be an attempt at my reasoning a= nd why I have such a sense of urgency about tie-ing this potential project = into a Sun Devil deal.  Here goes nothing:  As I understand it, the current senario for Sun Devil as it relates to the = San Juan section of this project includes: The addition of 15,000 hp at Bloomfield A compressor restage at Bisti A new 15,000 hp station at Standing Rock A larger compressor at Gallup Potentially a larger motor at Gallup  A suggested change to this plan was to look at the 41,000 hp GE's at Bloomf= ield and Standing Rock allowing us to stand-down the Electrics on the San J= uan Lateral.  The capital cost would increase by approximately $30 M but th= e capacity increase on the lateral would be around 80 mmcfd.  (These are no= t by any means firm numbers) =20  The problem with the suggestion obviously is the term of the contracts with=  ECS on the Electric drives.  So, this is what I was thinking.  I know we d= on't want to leave ECS holding the bag or stranding cost so, if the HRSG we= re to move forward at Station 1, maybe we could allow them to wheel the com= modity (the fuel gas) out there.  We provide them with gas in trade for ele= ctricity currently.  If we stand down the electrics, ECS would save dollars=  paid now to the utilities but, they would loose large bucks from the sale = of natural gas that we provide them for the power.  So, we could allow them=  to keep the gas for the remaining term of the contracts and sell it to Gad= d's group on the HRSG project.  Depending on the current margins, they may = be able to help Gadd's group cut some expense's as well and keep this proje= ct rolling???   (Motive is to get this HRSG going so Operations can generat= e some operating revenue off of this facility)   See the example below to f= ollow along with this idea:  ECS currently pays approximately $3,133,280 annually in electricity to prov= ide TW shaft horse power TW provides ECS with a commodity valued at $8,000,070 annually.  (At $2.50 = per thousand) The difference is $4,866,790 TW pays ECS a demand charge of $2,794,000 between Bisti and Bloomfield.  The $3,133,280 would be an expense ECS would no longer be required to have = if the Electrics were shut down.  So, ECS should be able to allow TW out of=  the $2,794,00 in annual demand charges for Bloomfield and Bisti and return=  the $3 M in commodity value to TW.  Now there is still the issue of the $8= ,000,070 in commodity value minus the $3,133,280 returned to TW.  We can ke= ep ECS whole on this value ($4,866,790) by transfering the fuel sale to the=  HRSG at Station 1 allowing them to simply sell the fuel there or market it=  accordingly for the term of the current contract.  As long as we keep ECS = whole on the value of this deal, in turn ECS should be able to negotiate a = deal at reduced rates to allow the HRSG project economics to become more ap= pealing...  At least that was my idea.  Pretty crazy huh? =20  None the less for an increase of 80 mmcfd on Sun Devil, the potential reven= ue from an operating agreement on the HRSG through EAMR, and the reduced ex= posure due to down time associated with the electric failures as compared t= o what GE is required to provide....... I thought it was worth a shot.  If = you think this is too far fetched....just say so Norm..  Not carrying anyth= ing on my shoulder here.  Have a good day and sorry this dang note was so l= ong... =20  Oh yea, I would have thrown Gallups numbers into this mix as well but, thos= e agreements are so complicated I have a hard time understanding and/or rel= aying information about them...   However, understand, when I say stand the=  electrics down on the San Juan lateral that includes, Bloomfield, Bisti an= d Gallup.....  R. Matthews ran the modeling info and that is who I have bee= n chatting with about this thought.  Like in school:  I thought I would show you my work... Bisit currently has a conversion factor of .0198 that multiplys into horse = power to determine how much fuel gas we owe them for shaft power.  They als= o have a contract with PNM that determines the rate ECS pays per Mega Watt = for the power they provide TW.   (I will use $2.50 for the price of gas in = examples)  ECS pays approximately $25 per meg for power at Bisti.  10,000 hp x .0198 x $2.50 =3D $495 per hour $495 / (10,000 x .7546) =3D $.0663 per kw=20 10,000 x .0198 x 8760 x $2.50 =3D $4,336,200 annually in fuel provided to E= CS  (10,000 x .7546) / 1000 x $25 =3D $188.65 per hour in electric cost $188.65 x 8760 =3D $1,652,574  annually in electric cost  Bloomfield currently has a conversion factor of .0239.  Power rate I think = is more in the range of $32 dollars a meg.  7000 hp x .0198 x $2.50 =3D $418 per hour $418 / (7000 x .7546) =3D .08 per kw=20 7000 x .0239 x 8760 x $2.50 =3D $3,663,870 annually in fuel provided to ECS  (7000 x .7546) / 1000 x $32 =3D $169.03 per hour in electric cost $169.03 x 8760 =3D $1,480,706 annually in electric cost  Ok, enough of all that.  The bottom line expenses are as follows: Bisti fuel commodity cost - $4,336,200 Bisti electricity cost - $1,652,574 Bisti demand fee paid to ECS - $2,017,000 Bloomfield fuel commodity cost - $3,663,870 Bloomfield electricity cost - $1,480,706 Bloomfield demand fee paid to ECS - $777,000  ---------------------- Forwarded by David Roensch/ET&S/Enron on 11/16/2001 = 12:38 PM --------------------------- From:=09Norm Spalding/ENRON@enronXgate on 11/12/2001 02:28 PM CST To:=09Rich Jolly/ET&S/Enron@ENRON, David Roensch/ET&S/Enron@ENRON cc:=09=20  Subject:=09FW: TW Waste Heat Recovery Projects  FYI.

Have a Safe & Happy Thanksgiving Everyone !!     THOU SHALT NOT SKIM FLAVOR FROM THE HOLIDAYS   By Craig Wilson, USA TODAY   I hate this time of year. Not for its crass commercialism and forced  frivolity, but because it's the season when the food police come out  with their wagging fingers and annual tips on how to get through the  holidays without gaining 10 pounds. You can't pick up a magazine  without finding a list of holiday eating do's and don'ts. Eliminate  second helpings, high-calorie sauces and cookies made with butter,  they say. Fill up on vegetable sticks, they say. Good grief. Is your  favorite childhood memory of Christmas a carrot stick? I didn't think  so. Isn't mine, either. A carrot was something you left for Rudolph.  I have my own list of tips for holiday eating. I assure you, if you  follow them, you'll be fat and happy. So what if you don't make it to  New Year's? Your pants won't fit anymore, anyway.   1. About those carrot sticks. Avoid them. Anyone who puts carrots on     a holiday buffet table knows nothing of the Christmas spirit. In     fact, if you see carrots, leave immediately. Go next door, where     they're serving rum balls.   2. Drink as much eggnog as you can. And quickly. Like fine     single-malt scotch, it's rare. In fact, it's even rarer than     single-malt scotch. You can't find it any other time of year but now.     So drink up! Who cares that it has 10,000 calories in every sip? It's     not as if you're going to turn into an egg- nogaholic or something.     It's a treat. Enjoy it. Have one for me. Have two. It's later than     you think. It's Christmas!   3. If something comes with gravy, use it. That's the whole point of     gravy. Pour it on. Make a volcano out of your mashed potatoes. Fill     it with gravy. Eat the volcano. Repeat.   4. As for mashed potatoes, always ask if they're made with skim milk     or whole milk. If it's skim, pass. Why bother? It's like buying a     sports car with an automatic transmission.   5. Do not have a snack before going to a party in an effort to control     your eating. The whole point of going to a Christmas party is to eat     other people's food for free. Lots of it. Hello? Remember college?   6. Under no circumstances should you exercise between now and New     Year's. You can do that in January when you have nothing else to do.     This is the time for long naps, which you'll need after circling the     buffet table while carrying a 10-pound plate of food and that vat of     eggnog.   7. If you come across something really good at a buffet table, like     frosted Christmas cookies in the shape and size of Santa, position     yourself near them and don't budge. Have as many as you can before     becoming the center of attention. They're like a beautiful pair of     shoes. You can't leave them behind. You're not going to see them     again.   8. Same for pies. Apple. Pumpkin. Mincemeat. Have a slice of each.     Or, if you don't like mincemeat, have two apples and one pumpkin.     Always have three. When else do you get to have more than one     dessert? Labor Day?   9. Did someone mention fruitcake? Granted, it's loaded with the     mandatory celebratory calories, but avoid it at all cost. I mean,     have some standards, mate.   10. And one final tip: If you don't feel terrible when you leave the      party or get up from the table, you haven't been paying attention.      Reread tips. Start over. But hurry! Cookieless January is just      around the corner.

"FYI.  ILY.  JTW.  >===== Original Message From ordinarylife-owner@yahoogroups.com ===== ORDINARY LIFE - Thoughts and Ideas to Help You Live a Happier Life  ======================================  Summary of November 25, 2001  ======================================  Dear Folks ?     It's going to be difficult to give a summary of our gathering for this past Sunday. Several people got up and gave their reasons/ reactions to Thanksgiving. I've included below some of the remarks I made and what I had available of what others contributed to the occasion. It was, to me, a wonderful gathering. Enjoy!  Much love,  Bill Kerley  ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++            Thanksgiving 2001     This past week contained our national holiday, Thanksgiving. As I see it, you and I have so much for which to be grateful.     That we are here able to participate in and benefit from this gathering is so profound a blessing.     Last week I wasn't here. I was visiting with my father and brother in Tennessee. It was almost the first time I've gotten to fly since my eye challenge. So, I hadn't seen my Dad since shortly after my mother's death in January.     I am grateful to and for my parents. I'm grateful not only for their long lives but for the many gifts I have received from them. As I visited with my father and brother I was aware of such a rich history. I'm grateful for that. I'm grateful for growth itself. I noticed, for example, that I was relieved to notice that I have gotten over my sibling rivalry issues. Of course, my fancy-pants-Mr.-Big-Shot-retired- vice-president-of-a-big-corporation hasn't.     I'm grateful for life itself.     I heard a story recently about a man who was in the hospital. His wife was with him when the doctor came in to visit the man. The man was suffering from some mysterious malady. After a few minutes examining the patient, the doctor called the wife out into the hall. He said to her, ""I've done all I can do for your husband. I'm going to dismiss him. Your husband is suffering from a very serious disease, combined with horrible stress. If you don't do the following, your husband can die: Each morning, fix him a healthy breakfast. Be pleasant and make sure he is in a good mood. For lunch, fix him a nutritious meal. For dinner, prepare an especially nice meal for him. Don't burden him with chores. Don't discuss your stress; this will probably make him feel worse. And most importantly, you must be intimate with your husband every day of the week. If you can do this for at least ten months to a year, I think your husband will regain his health completely.""    On the way home, the husband asked his wife, ""When the doctor called you out into the hall, what did he say to you?""    She reached over and patted him on the leg and said, ""He said that you're going to die.""     I am also grateful to and for you.     I issued some invitations for folks to come and share their reasons for being grateful. I don't know who might respond but if you are here and want to do that, now is the time.     At this point the following people spoke to the Ordinary Life gathering:     Marti Nelson spoke about her experience at the 10-Day - The Retreat of Noble Silence. She said that it was one of the most difficult and important things she has ever done for herself. Even more difficult than the chemotherapy she has been through the past year for cancer. But so valuable! She encouraged everyone to do it.     Then Ron Marr came with some words he had prepared for the occasion I'm going to share some of them here:       The Truth About Thanksgiving     Some years ago Bill observed, ""If the work of art you are creating is your life, you don't want the canvas to be too small."" My thanksgiving story is a life in process, and thankfully, its fabric keeps expanding.    I once led a class on the subject ""Truth Telling."" In preparing, I gathered numerous quotes collected over the years; some humorous; some wise. Attempting somehow to reconcile the many themes running wild through the pages, I observed that ""all Christian truth is relational."" Some cosmologists and quantum physicists would argue that at some level, the same is true for the physical universe.    In one way or another, all significant venues of my existence involve some aspect of my relationship with God, my relationship with myself, my relationship with my fellow human beings, and/or my relationship with the planet and all other living things.    It's in these realms I experience my deepest sadness, and my greatest joys. In each I encounter the inescapable drama of separation and reconciliation, and gratefully, the alchemy of grace.    In the days following 9/11 my soul ached, and I felt a great sadness. Not only for the obvious tragedy, but also for the remnants of fear, anger, judgment, and separation that persist, to some extent, in our own hearts and communities. We have difficulty fully loving and accepting our selves to the point where we can receive effortlessly, and without resistance or manipulation, the love constantly being extended to us.    Even within our churches we have yet to fully embrace those of differing race, sexual orientation, and faith traditions. One writer following 9/11 characterized the ""real war"" as between those who worship a god of anger & judgment, and those who worship a God of Love.    And, I am grateful for -    a wave moving silently through the land - the re-valuing of living authentically;    the honest sharing of fears ? and dreams ? being expressed in so many gatherings, following 9/11;    for peoples everywhere, in every arena, now holding hands with those who were invisible (or worse) only a brief time earlier.    An intimate connection seems to exist between the quest for honesty and a transparent personality.    Since my divorce many years ago, Thanksgiving and Christmas have too often found me mired in sadness, longing for my kids. Too often reliving the pain of so many losses not fully grieved. Especially the loss of deep intimacy, and family with which I crave so deeply to feel a belonging.    This week I had the privilege of delivering to my father the gift he had selected from his nursing home bed, for my stepmother's birthday. I also brought a couple of cards that sounded very much like him. Signing one of the cards took almost fifteen minutes and I feared his note would be illegible. Looking closer, I could read the tiny, shaking letters ? and the four words, ""All my love - - Dick.""  And I knew the powerful connection of family, and felt sheer joy at having been, in some small way, a conduit for my best friend's love.     If you are interested in the full text of Ron's remarks, e-mail him at     rmarr@netropolis.net     At this point I remarked about how wonderful people are. So creative and inventive. There are so many different ways to look at things. Each of us sees things differently.     Aren't you grateful for the human mind itself? And for having a sound mind?     Jim and Mary were both patients in a Mental Hospital. One day while they were walking past the hospital swimming pool, Jim suddenly jumped into the deep end. He sunk to the bottom & stayed there. Mary promptly jumped in to save him. She swam to the bottom and pulled Jim out. When the medical director became aware of Mary's heroic act he immediately ordered her to be discharged from the hospital, as he now considered her to be mentally stable.    When he went to tell Mary the news he said, ""Mary, I have good news & bad news.  The good news is you're being discharged because since you were able to jump in and save the life of another patient, I think you've regained your senses. The bad news is, Jim, the patient you saved, hung himself with his bathrobe belt in the bathroom. I am so sorry, but he's dead.""    Mary replied, ""He didn't hang himself, I put him there to dry.""     To prove how creative people are Stephanie Warfield, Chaplain at St. Luke's Episcopal Hospital came and read excerpts from her most recent ""Chaplain's Journal."" This included reading a list of 100 things for which she was grateful. As she read the list, I read the faces of those who were present. What she said seemed to spark memories of things that perhaps we'd otherwise have forgotten about.     Bob Stecker came and reminded us about the importance of humor in life with a story from his days as a drama director.     Jean Snyder told of her gratitude for all the help and support she felt while she and Marti went through a year of Marti's cancer treatment and recovery.     Casey Kelly came to give one brief line. It was this:     ""Life is a comedy; tragedy is the long moment before we get the joke.""     I reflect back on the themes we strike in here over and over. They are:     There is no enlightenment out there. This is it.    What matters most of all is to have a true present. Doing so is very difficult. We spend so much of our lives dwelling on past regrets and/ or fantasizing future disasters or hopes.    It takes a long time to grow in wisdom, to say nothing of the time it takes to think well.    If you truly want to be free, give up judging, comparing and needing to know why.    Be happy. That is not a nice wish like ""have a nice day."" It is an instruction. In a world like ours it is a moral obligation to be joyful.     I am grateful that we have the opportunity to revisit these, and other, notions as the circumstances of our lives and our lives themselves continue to ebb and flow with the passing of time.     A very dear friend of mine, Linda McCleskey, who lives in Seattle, sent me a poem that is fitting to close this celebration of gratitude with:           A Poem by Starhawk                Community.     Somewhere, there are people    to whom we can speak with passion    without having the words catch in our throats.    Somewhere a circle of hands will open to receive us,    eyes will light up as we enter, voices will celebrate with us    whenever we come into our own power.    Community means strength that joins our strength    to do the work that needs to be done.    Arms to hold us when we falter.    A circle of healing. A circle of friends.    Someplace where    we can be free.     I'm glad that this gathering which we call Ordinary Life is that for those of us who choose to be present.     This has gotten to be my closing ritual/blessing to you:    No matter where you go this week, no matter what happens, remember this: You are carrying precious cargo. Watch your step.  ======================================  Ordinary Life is a gathering that provides an opportunity to develop an enlightened heart and an awakened mind to the reality of the present moment.

We have a spare bedroom and free parking. If it works out that Mike drops Cheryl off and needs a place to stay, either overnight or periodically during the day, we'll leave a key at the front desk of the Spires and one (or both) of you can base out of our place.  And if you need someone to take care of the menagerie up north, I'm sure we can figure out how to get that done while you're staying down south.

It moves the overhaul on unit 401 into March, which is the same month we are doing the tie-ins at Station 1 and 3. And since there will be a flow restriction from those tie-ins we can coordinate the two outages together and save a little of the flow loss. 2. Starting and finishing the overhauls earlier will keep us away from our summer comments, if there are problems or delays.

He made a request that we configure our flo= w control valve with a pressure control over-ride and reduce the supply pre= ssure to the Citizens station supplying the Griffith power plant.  Although=  I know the RTU has this capability, I told Robert that I would have to che= ck with our Tech folks to see if we had this capability.  My concern was th= at by lowering our supply pressure to Citizens it would make it easier to s= witch or split flows to the power plant with El Paso.  El Paso's supply pre= ssure runs a couple of hundred pounds lower than TW's in this area and they=  cannot get in to Citizens with incurring huge swings at Citizens and shutt= ing TW in currently.  So, simply stated, I did not want to proceed without = direction from Marketing or Gas Control.  If I remember correctly when I ca= lled and discussed this issue with you a couple of weeks ago, we were in ag= reement not do reduce the pressure supply to Griffith but, you were going t= o communicate this with them.  I am still getting calls from Robert and I'm=  not sure how to handle his request at this point. =20  Please do not confuse this issue with the Batching valve that is currently = out of service.  Also, do not confuse with Choquettes request to provide pr= essure over-ride at this point as that can be done to provide steady state = pressure with a flow control over-ride without reducing supply pressure dra= matically to this interconnect point.  (However, there is the concern that = if we install pressure control with a flow control over-ride that we put ou= rselves in the position of reducing this supply pressure over time and then=  getting into competing issues with El Paso. =20  I do not care how we configure this point.

On Tuesday night, December 25th, prompt JAN 02 reached a high of 3.050 during Access and then proceeded to close at 2.911 at the end of the regular pit session on Wednesday, December 26th.  Furthermore, prices continued to erode during last night's Access and closed at 2.775.  Currently, JAN 02 is trading at 2.680 on its expiry, and FEB 02 is trading at 2.700.    With the inability of the prompt to close > 2.960, and a subsequent sharp drop in prices, it is logical to infer that 3.050 was definitely a short to intermediate term top. What this means is if the move from 3.440 to 2.180 was an A wave down (a 1.260 decline), and the move from 2.180 to 3.050 was the B wave up, then the downside targets (C wave down) are 2.270 (.618 of A=C) and 1.790 (A=C).

ORDINARY LIFE - Thoughts and Ideas to Help You Live a Happier Life  ======================================  Summary of December 30, 2001  ======================================  Dear Folks ?     On the last Sunday of 2001, we talked about the matter of time. How fast it passes! What are we to do with it? We are to wait. This class was about what we are waiting for and how we are to wait. The answers are both maddening and embarrassing. There is also an excursion here about how to read the Bible and how Fundamentalism came to be.     I hope you find this inspirational and valuable as you reflect on the year just passed and prepare for what is to come.     Some famous author once wrote (and I can't find his name now): ""No one ever greeted the first of the year with indifference. I believe that is true. It is a time of new beginnings and of hope. I wish that for you.     What follows is the full text from which I spoke on Sunday.  Much love,  Bill Kerley  ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++             Hurry Up and Wait  ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++     Living life is an art. Our lives and our living are pieces of art to create. Isn't that a great concept? Learning this art is important because we don't have much time to live, do we?     This stuff we call ""time"" goes so fast, so very fast.     I'm fascinated with time, utterly fascinated. I have surrounded myself with countless devices for measuring the passing of time.     For years and years I kept a Day-Timer. I experimented with various sizes and styles. I think I was hoping that if I found the perfect system, I'd be able to accomplish all that I wanted to. Wrong! I've never been able to do that. But, keeping a DayTimer did enable me to see what I do with time and why and what I allow time to do with me and why. I can experience how rapidly it passes and how slowly it drags out. Now for years I've gone paperless and have been using a Palm device. It serves the same function as a DayTimer - just easier to carry.     If I go back and look at pages from my DayTimer from several years ago it sometimes seems like I was another person.     When I began doing sitting meditation I could experience time as if it were molasses or as a flash of lightening. Sometimes it seems I have been sitting forever and I will open my eyes to see that only a few minutes have passed. At other times, an hour passes in five minutes.     Time is so central to us. Think of all the books we read, the instructions we follow, the activities we do just to help us structure time. Early on in life someone gives us a watch and says to us, ""Don't be late again."" They make an assumption. They assume that we know how to tell time.     ""What did you do?""    ""What are you doing?""    ""What are you going to do?"" These are all time questions.     When you look at life spiritually, which really is your only option, there is a meaningful answer to all the questions we raise about time. But we find the answer both maddening and embarrassing.     Maddening because it turns out that what we are to do with our time is to wait.     The word ""wait"" is one of the most characteristic words in the Bible.     ""Wait on the Lord.""    ""They that wait upon the Lord shall inherit the earth.""    ""My soul waits for the Lord more than they that watch for the morning.""     According to my count the word ""wait"" is found in the Bible exactly 100 times. If I were to read them all, you would wait a long time. Who wants to spend time like that? What's so maddening about waiting is that we don't know how. We don't like encountering or being confronted with stuff we don't know how to do.     In my own life one of the frustrating and disappointing things I've noticed is how I've backslidden in the area of patience.     Sometimes we structure time by getting involved in a process we call ""business as usual."" When we do that, the right now - the present moment - is stripped of any urgency or importance it might have.     These gatherings we've been calling Ordinary Life aren't about business as usual. Those of you here who have trouble with the church have this complaint. The church has often pretended it didn't live in the twentieth century. So the church has sometimes ignored the vast changes taking place out there in the world. Being the last to speak about major issues ? integrity, being good stewards of the earth's resources, learning to live interdependently, sexist language, outdated world view ? you name it.     Religious organizations, churches and synagogues, constitute the second largest land-holder and purchaser of goods and services in this country. What a power we could be! And yet, historically, the church has had to be hit over the head before it opens its eyes to what is happening in the world, content to let the world be damned unless it enters our ecclesiastical ghetto. No urgency, no living on tiptoe, not breathless as to the Kingdom of God being here and now. Just business as usual.     I said a moment ago that looking at the world spiritually is our only option. That isn't true. You can look at the world religiously. I'm going to overstate this case. Religion is about fear. Spirituality is what's on the other side of fear. As someone once said: ""Religion is for people who are afraid of hell. Spirituality is for people who have been there.""     When I was growing up in a Southern Baptist Church in Columbia, Tennessee, a lot of my religious instruction was fear-based. There are some words and phrases that I wish I'd never heard, not because they are not good words, but because they got so contaminated. Among these are words like ""sin,"" ""commitment,"" ""dedication.""     We hear phrases growing up that shape us. I said in one of our recent times together that there is nothing wrong with you. You're just fine. In response to that someone who gets the e-mail summaries of this class sent me this:     ""Unless you were raised by wolves, the chances are extremely good that as you were growing up you heard at least a few of the following:     Don't do that.    Stop that.    Put that down.    I told you not to do that.    Why don't you ever listen?    Wipe that look off your face.    I'll give you something to cry about.    Don't touch that.    You shouldn't feel that way.    You should have known better.    Will you ever learn?    You should be ashamed of yourself.    Shame on you.    I can't believe you did that.    Don't ever let me see you do that again.    See, that serves you right.    Because I told you so.    Are you ever going to get it?    What were the last words out of my mouth?    What were you thinking of?    You ruin everything.    You have no sense.    You're nuts. The nurses must have dropped you on your head.    Just once, do something right.    I've sacrificed everything for you and what thanks do I get?    I had great hopes for you.    If I've told you once, I've told you a thousand times.    Give an inch and you take a mile.    Anybody would know that.    Don't talk back to me.    You'll do as you are told.    That's not funny.    Who do you think you are?    Why did you do it that way?    You were born bad.    You drive me crazy.    You do that just to hurt me.    I could skin you alive.    What will the neighbors say?    You do that to torture me.    You're so mean.    I could beat the daylights out of you.    Don't you dare look at me like that.    You're just a little brat.    It's all your fault.    You make me sick.    You're trying to kill me.    Now, what's the matter with you, crybaby?    Go to your room.    You deserve it.    Eat it because children are starving.    Don't stick your lip out.    If you cry, I'll slap you.    Don't you ever think about anyone else?    Get out of my sight.    Do as I say not as I do.     ""Hearing lines like these, somewhere along the way you concluded that there was something wrong with you.    ""What else could you conclude?    ""If there were nothing wrong with you, people wouldn't say things like that to you or treat you that way!""     We heard those lines because those who spoke them had heard them. It is with our awareness that we are to break the chain of saying such lines - our awareness and compassion.     In order to do this, we must take some words and phrases and retranslate them. That's is part of our agenda in the weeks ahead.     Meanwhile, back to waiting.     There is a little story in the Bible that is very instructive.     It is found in Luke 12:42-46.     ""And the Lord replied, 'I'm talking to any faithful, sensible man whose master gives him the responsibility of feeding the other servants. If his master returns and finds that he has done a good job, there will be a reward ? his master will put him in charge of all he owns.    But if the man begins to think, 'My Lord won't be back for a long time,' and begins to whip the men and women he is supposed to protect, and to spend his time at drinking parties and in drunkenness ? well, his master will return without notice and remove him from his position of trust and assign him to the place of the unfaithful.""     The master goes away and entrusts his estate to a servant who doesn't do what he is supposed to do.     Jesus was talking about the religious institution and religious leaders of his day.     If he were here, he might be saying it to us. Well, we haven't gone to beating people and getting drunk a lot but men and women have been beaten by the massive indifference of the church to the problems of race and poverty and peace and religious institutions have gotten drunk on buildings and power and prestige. The reaction of some people to this behavior is a kind of disenchantment with the church, or disgust with the church, or indifference to the church.     I was astounded at the statistic when I heard it. Sixty percent of persons now alive in this country have never been to church.     I graduated from high school on the eve of the Supreme Court's decision to desegregate public schools. 1955. When I was just a little boy, I knew about the injustice in the racial system in the South where I lived. I was frustrated and angry with the church about it's blindness, about its participation in this system.     I wanted nothing to do with business as usual. So, I became part of a movement to ""abolish the old. Down with bureaucracy. Spirituality is about change. The moment is now. Stale water is turned into heady wine. The new age is here. The future is now. We shall overcome. There is no time for business as usual. Let's grab the future in our bare hands and bring it here.""     So we marched and we sat and we debated and wrote and then you know what we did? We waited. We realized we weren't so powerful. Now I can look back and see that though ""business as usual"" for a religious organization can get it away from its fundamental purpose and create a cultural ghetto; dragging change in can be equally idolatrous. Creating life isn't up to us, we aren't that powerful.     How maddening it is to discover that we don't know how to wait.     What's more, we are embarrassed about what it is we are waiting for.     So embarrassed, I've never even talked about it in here.     We are to wait. But what good does it do to watch and wait if we don't know what we are looking for and waiting for? What are we waiting for, anyway?     You're waiting for me to say.     We're waiting - for the second coming.     Isn't that what you were talking about at work this past week? No?     When I was working on this for today, I had this fantasy during the week of someone inviting a visitor to this class and saying to that person something like: ""I'd like for you to come to my Sunday School Class.""    ""Well, Sunday School isn't for me.""    ""But this isn't your usual Sunday School class. It's not a Bible study, no outdated religious language.""     And so far today I've read from the Bible and am talking about the ""second coming.""     Let me say a word or two about the Bible.     Conflict about the Bible is the single most divisive issue among Christians - especially in this country. The conflict, as Marcus Borg points out, is about two very different ways of interpreting or reading the Bible. One way is a ""literal-factual"" way and the other is a ""historical-metaphorical"" way.     The ""literal-factual"" way is the way most fundamentalists approach the Bible. As you might guess, I'm in the ""historical-metaphorical"" camp. This would be very important to how I would describe my religious posture. Not only am I non-literalistic but also non-exclusivistic. I am living out my relationship to God within the Christian tradition but I want to honor the validity of all the enduring religious traditions. There is no way to know what is ""the truth"" about this because there is no way we can step outside our own personal and cultural history and context. You'll have to test for yourself whether what I am saying about this makes sense to you or not.     The conflict about the Bible can be seen showing up in three arenas. First, is the view over the creation of the earth - creationism versus evolution.     The second is the raging debate dividing the church today over homosexuality.     The third has to do with one's view of Jesus. The renewed quest for the historical Jesus has been met with much negativity among fundamentalist and conservative Christians. To see Jesus as a man strikes at the very heart of their faith.     Fundamentalism - regardless of which religion you find it in - is a very modern phenomenon. It is a reaction against modern culture and appeared, in the United States, only early in the twentieth century. It stresses the infallibility and inerrancy of the Bible in every aspect. And it has done so militantly. Someone has said that a Fundamentalist is an evangelical Christian who is angry about something.     Martin Luther and John Calvin - leaders of the Protestant Reformation certainly had high regard for the Bible but never took a view that it was infallible in the way current fundamentalists do.     You also have to keep in mind that ordinary people simply did not read the Bible until about 500 years ago. Only if you were educated and knew Latin, Greek or Hebrew and had access to handwritten manuscripts could you do so. Two events changed this. One was the invention of the printing press and the other was the translation of the Scriptures into a common language.     Making the Bible available to everybody has been a mixed blessing. A positive one is that it made real what the Protestant Reformation was all about - the priesthood of believers or, as Marcus Borg calls it, the democratization of Christianity. No longer are the riches of the Bible known only to a few. When William Tyndale translated the Bible into English, his reward was that he was burned at the stake. He wanted to enable ""a boy that driveth the plow to know more of the Scriptures than a priest.""     But, the negative side is that it has made possible individual interpretations of the Bible that has led to more divisions among Christians than any other single thing. Think of it: prior to the invention of the printing press no one had seen such a thing as a Bible. It didn't exist as a single bound book. It was a collection of various manuscripts usually referred to as ""the Scriptures."" What we call the Gospels were first referred to as ""memoirs"" of the Apostles. But once all the books were selected (which is another story!) and bound into one volume, it was easy to think of the Bible as a single book - not the library that it is - and that this book had a single author, God.     Fundamentalism brings with it not only changes in how we view the Bible but in how we view so much else. Like time. Sherry pointed out to me an article in the New York Times yesterday (12/29/01) on billable hours. If one takes a billable hours approach to life, every hour is just like every other. There is not much room for quality, worth, satisfaction in a job well done, or for ritual.     Take our personal relationships. I ran across a phrase in ""Spirituality and Health"" that caught me up short: Intimacy: In-time-I- see.     We are taught to keep time by billable hours, to focus on ""quality time,"" ""watch the clock,"" etc. Yet, at the heart of a useful spiritual practice is how we relate to time. I stress to you the importance of a practice. I don't care what it is. But something that consciously grounds you, that gives you a perspective on your life and the events through which you navigate.     One of the most important spiritual practices can be summed up by the words ""watching and waiting."" But what are we watching and waiting for? The Christian answer is ""the second coming."" Bear with me.     The watching and the waiting in spiritual practice is supposed to give an invigorating sense of existential urgency to the way we live our lives. You know how we can allow drab routine to eat large hunks out of our lives. And it is kind of hard to get that sense of urgency if it turns out that what we're waiting for is something as seemingly far-removed as the second coming.     I asked a Jewish rabbi (a redundancy) once on the television show I did years ago if the Jews were still expecting the messiah. He said: ""About as much as you Christians are looking for the second coming."" Which is to say, not much. Not really.     Those of us who worship across the street say the Apostles' Creed and it has the lines about Jesus coming back to judge the quick and the dead. But let's face it. Let's be honest. In our day-to-day lives none of us is craning our necks and straining our eyes waiting for some cosmic catastrophe that might occur in five seconds or five million years. The second coming just doesn't have any realistic relationship to the way we live our lives. So the notion of the ""second coming"" just drops out of sight.     And why shouldn't it? I grew up being taught that I'd better be careful because ""Jesus is coming back like a thief in the night.""     When I was just a child, I can remember Billy Graham assuring us that we were living in ""the last days.""     I'm both embarrassed and angry about the way this notion of the second coming has been used to manipulate and scare people into goodness. I'm not the only person in this room who has heard, ""Don't do anything you wouldn't want to be caught doing when Jesus comes.""     And yet, I can say to you, that learning to wait for the second coming, is a large part of the art of living. My goal in the rest of this presentation is to try to make that clear.     The second coming is not some date off out there in the future. To wait literally for Jesus to appear in the sky is as misinformed as it would be to go on some archaeological search for the Garden of Eden and Adam and Eve. Those things don't literally exist. Never did.     What Jesus talked to people about was the urgency of the time in which they lived. That's what that story of his I read to you is about. It is about an expected coming and a delay.     Jesus spoke this parable to the religious leaders of the day and was trying to arouse them to the fact that their day of destiny as the people of God was upon them - right now. They were being visited with the truth - right now. They were to know what hour it is and be ready. They were to recognize the ultimate choices of life and death when those choices were present and they were present right now.     That's what the early church was focusing on when it talked about the second coming. They were giving life the urgency that life calls for; they were recognizing the nearness of the ultimate; the constant possibility of experiencing the presence of God. They did that in the symbol of Christ coming back.     Spiritual language is full of symbols like that, symbols that convey a truth that is greater than literal truth. Symbols are what make truth vivid.     For example, one abiding truth, one of our continuing experiences is the tendency we have to deny our humanity and attempt to be God to ourselves. This is what sin is. This sin is such a central issue in the living of our lives that you can never really say all there is to say about it. What is needed is a story to convey it. Everything you always wanted to know about sin but were afraid to ask is therefore contained in a story about a man and a woman named Adam and Eve.     That's the way it is with the second coming. If you get hung up on or embarrassed by taking the symbol of the second coming literally, you'll miss its real meaning and impact     Here it is: There is nothing out there we need to draw into our lives, there is nothing out there we need to keep out of our lives that will make us happy or bring us fulfillment. Or, that will keep us from experiencing the harm, difficulties, problems, and failures that are a part of being human. To get involved in either one of those activities is to miss the experience of hope and judgment right here, right now.     If we turn our backs on this sometimes hard, brutal, grim world as it is, we turn our backs on the only source for knowing God we ever have had or every will have. If we turn our backs on the present by concentrating on getting stuff into or keeping stuff out of our lives, we'll miss God in the now. The heart of spiritual truth is about the reality that God is right here, right now.     Now, I'll grant this is sometimes hard to see. Finding God in the world is sometimes like trying to see the picture in those magic eye things. You have to develop another way of seeing.     Nothing is easier than to miss the God who is always present among us and between us. The God who is present in the headlines of today's paper and in the requests of those who call for us to help.     I want what happens in here to be about God in the world now and the urgency of finding God in the world now.     That's what the second coming is about. The second coming is a powerful symbol that conveys a truth too important to forget. I'm not asking you to believe that Jesus is going to come knocking on your door tonight or that he is going to come back and walk the streets as a human being as he did before. To get you to look for the second coming is just a dramatic way to get us to stop and think. And that's just what happened in this room a few minutes ago when I first used the phrase ""second coming."" It got your attention. Supposing our everyday lives were suddenly crossed by his? What would he think of us or we of him?     Second coming. That's picture language. Dramatic language. It isn't describing in advance a literal event that you could pick up on a radar screen. You know, I hope, that the story of Adam and Eve is not describing an incident that happened only once in the past. The story of Adam and Eve and Cain and Able ? and all the rest ? describes something that continues to happen to all of us all the time.     That's the way it is with the second coming. It is not just a single event that might or might not happen in our lifetime. If it were a literal event, it would have meaning only for those in whose lifetime it took place.     The symbol of the second coming, if understood properly, helps us recognize and live with the reality that is meeting us all the time and continues to meet us all the time. It is not just something that is confined to the end.     The phrase ""second coming"" is nowhere in the Bible. A more accurate translation of it would be ""presence."" What it means is that we all the time live on the edge of time. We forget this. Our actions, whether good or not, have an ultimate significance. Our actions, whether good or not, have effects of infinite range and scope. We are always standing under incalculable responsibility. We are to be faithful in little things because there are no little things. We are to be faithful in God's absence because God is never absent. To be concerned with the end in this way is to deal with the right here, right now.     Everywhere, all the time, what we call Christ is present. No way of getting away from it. Go wherever you want. Wait till doomsday if you wish. There is still that standard of love and justice all around us ? in the person who sitting next to you right now, in the headlines of today's paper, in the obscure stories on the back pages, in the requests to meet the needs of the down-and-out that we feed lunches to across the street, or, in the so-called sophistication of the up-and-in worshipping in the cathedral across the street. It is this presence we are to watch for. It is this presence we are to wait for.     How do we do that?  How are we to structure our time so that we can be sensitive to that Holy Presence right here, right now?     We are to wait.     I mentioned earlier that the word ""wait"" is used a hundred times in the Bible. Of course, the word ""wait"" is a translation from Hebrew and Greek into English. As with all languages, you can't translate from one into the other without losing something.     One meaning of the word ""wait"" in the Bible draws the picture of being stretched taut, of being pulled. Much as you might twist the strands of fiber to make a rope. This is the tension of enduring. So there is a line in the Psalms that goes, ""My soul waits for the Lord more than they that watch for the morning."" You can almost see the passionate expectancy of the watchman eagerly looking out into the night watching for every little noise, being alert, watching for the dawn. That's waiting. It is expecting something that hasn't happened to happen and it is to be looking out for it.     We are not pushed by the past or pulled by the future. We are not what we have been nor what we will be. At each moment we are free to change the significance of the past for the present and free to choose a new mode of expressing ourselves in the future. Each moment demands that we make ourselves over by another free choice. And that moment is now. I don't know a better definition of spiritual well-being than this. Spiritual well-being is the absence of ""elsewhereness."" It is ""presenteesism"" in contrast to ""absenteeism."" Years ago, I was planning an event with my son and I asked him when he wanted to do it. He said, ""I want to do it in the middle of right now."" That's the only time we've got.     There is another word for ""wait"" in the Bible. It is a kind of quiet, meditative, passive waiting. It is the kind of waiting we do when we are without any conscious awareness of God's nearness. It is in the line, ""They that wait on the Lord shall renew their strength.""     We shortchange this kind of waiting with our impatience and our franticness. Yet, this kind of waiting is a crucial part of every spiritual tradition. It's the forty years in the wilderness and the fifty years in exile in the Old Testament. It was the generations before Jesus came, the 40 days in the desert.     It is in waiting like this that the very reality of faith is unfolded because faith implies a certain not having, a certain not knowing, a certain being without. It is in waiting like this that faith is faith and not superstition. It is in this kind of waiting where being religious is so dangerous and being spiritual is so essential.     Somehow, which is what I hope our times in here are ultimately all about, we must learn to play this waiting game by holding both kinds of waiting together. The passionate expectancy in one hand, the mystery of it all in the other. This is how we are to structure our time.     If you have ever had to do any significant waiting, you know that it's good to have a place to be while you wait. That's what this gathering we call Ordinary Life is about.     Someone asked once, how do you join this class? You can't join. If you are here, you are a member. And if you are a member, your business is about the management of this estate with which you have been entrusted.     There is a very instructive line in the middle of that story of Jesus. ""Happy is the servant if the master finds that person faithfully discharging these duties when he comes again.""     It's the ""happy"" that is in this prayer I offer for and about you.     May you be filled with loving kindness and compassion.    May you be happy.    May you be peaceful and at ease.    May you be well.    May no harm come to you.    May no difficulties come to you.    May no problems come to you.    May you always meet with success.    May you also be given the patience (ability to wait), the courage, the understanding, and the determination to meet and overcome the inevitable difficulties, problems, and failures that are a part of this life.     No matter where you go this week, no matter what happens, remember this: You are carrying precious cargo. Watch your step.  ======================================  Ordinary Life is a gathering that provides an opportunity to develop an enlightened heart and an awakened mind to the reality of the present moment.

This one, sent to me by George Leyendecker, has some fresh ones ?     1. The best way to get even is to forget.    2. Feed your faith and your doubts will starve to death.    3. God wants spiritual fruit, not religious nuts.    4. Some folks wear their halos much too tight.    5. Some marriages are made in heaven, but they ALL have to be maintained on earth.    6. Unless you can create the WHOLE universe in 5 days, then perhaps giving ""advice"" to God, isn't such a good idea!    7. Sorrow looks back, worry looks around, and faith looks up.    8. Standing in the middle of the road is dangerous. You will get knocked down by the traffic from both ways.    9. Words are windows to the heart.   10. A skeptic is a person who when he sees the handwriting on the wall, claims it's a forgery.   11. It isn't difficult to make a mountain out of a molehill just add a little dirt.   12. A successful marriage isn't finding the right person, it's being the right person.   13. The mighty oak tree was once a little nut that held its ground.   14. Too many people offer God prayers, with claw marks all over them.   15. The tongue must be heavy indeed, because so few people can hold it.   16. To forgive is to set the prisoner free, and then discover the prisoner was you.   17. You have to wonder about humans, they think God is dead and Elvis is alive!   18. It's all right to sit on your pity pot every now and again. Just be sure to flush when you are done.   19. You'll notice that a turtle only makes progress when it sticks out its neck.   20. If the grass is greener on the other side of the fence, you can bet the water bill is higher.   21. You are richer today if you have laughed, given, and forgiven.     These are pithy sentences that can cause us to laugh and to think.     There is another phrase I use in our work from time to time. It is -     Having a heart as light as a feather.     What does that mean?     Is it possible?      If it is, what keeps us from experiencing it more?     These are some of the questions I want to talk with you about when we gather this Sunday. I invite you ?    to be present,     to bring your heart,      to be prepared to lay aside some of your burdens, and       to dare to open some doors to new life.     My heart is hoping to see you Sunday.

The TW reps agreed that the best method to accomplish the Blanco interconnect would be for TW to tap its existing 30 inch (formerly NWPL Ignacio-Blanco) pipeline that is running N-S approx 120 lf east of the proposed S Trails Blanco Meter site.  To accomplish the tie in would then require about 120 lf of 20 inch (or perhaps 12 inch) pipeline, parallel to the right of way corridor that Questar has already acquired from TW for the extension to WFS Milagro.  The custody transfer meter facilities and any control facilities would then be installed on the Questar site.  TW stated that pressure ranges between 928 to 950 psig in this  30 inch pipeline.  Agreement needs to be finalized on who installs the tap, pipeline tie in, and meter facilities.    It would be good if TW would agree that Questar could accomplish all work, with the exception of the tap of the 30 inch pipeline.  In any event, S Trails needs to contribute our meter parcel site for the location for meter facilities, whether TW or Questar installes these facilities.    The TW reps were going to convey this info to Ron Mathews of TW.   Conceptually, this location is as shown on the TW dwg, dated 11-26-01, prepared by RLM.

"The MLP discussions have been on using Northern Border.    Regarding KMI, Mark and I met with them before Xmas to see where they were on the rate.  They have not presented anything to their management team for approval beyond our original proposal.    I believe that Stan is looking for the status of the game plan.  We are looking to lay out the game plan on how we would finance the project(if we project finance I think Stan and Danny are looking at securing enough money at the same time to do the Sun Devil, Trans Pecos and PG&E 20 mile line all together), define what the project return requirement is, determine the comfort factor of the project costs, staying in concert with KMI and making the final proposal to Pemex.

This one, sent to me by George Leyendecker, has some fresh ones -     1. The best way to get even is to forget.    2. Feed your faith and your doubts will starve to death.    3. God wants spiritual fruit, not religious nuts.    4. Some folks wear their halos much too tight.    5. Some marriages are made in heaven, but they ALL have to be maintained on earth.    6. Unless you can create the WHOLE universe in 5 days, then perhaps giving ""advice"" to God, isn't such a good idea!    7. Sorrow looks back, worry looks around, and faith looks up.    8. Standing in the middle of the road is dangerous. You will get knocked down by the traffic from both ways.    9. Words are windows to the heart.   10. A skeptic is a person who when he sees the handwriting on the wall, claims it's a forgery.   11. It isn't difficult to make a mountain out of a molehill just add a little dirt.   12. A successful marriage isn't finding the right person, it's being the right person.   13. The mighty oak tree was once a little nut that held its ground.   14. Too many people offer God prayers, with claw marks all over them.   15. The tongue must be heavy indeed, because so few people can hold it.   16. To forgive is to set the prisoner free, and then discover the prisoner was you.   17. You have to wonder about humans, they think God is dead and Elvis is alive!   18. It's all right to sit on your pity pot every now and again. Just be sure to flush when you are done.   19. You'll notice that a turtle only makes progress when it sticks out its neck.   20. If the grass is greener on the other side of the fence, you can bet the water bill is higher.   21. You are richer today if you have laughed, given, and forgiven.     These are pithy sentences that can cause us to laugh and to think.     There is another phrase I use in our work from time to time. It is -     Having a heart as light as a feather.     What does that mean?     Is it possible?      If it is, what keeps us from experiencing it more?     These are some of the questions I want to talk with you about when we gather this Sunday. I invite you -    to be present,     to bring your heart,      to be prepared to lay aside some of your burdens, and       to dare to open some doors to new life.     My heart is hoping to see you Sunday.

The TW reps agreed that the best method to accomplish the Blanco interconnect would be for TW to tap its existing 30 inch (formerly NWPL Ignacio-Blanco) pipeline that is running N-S approx 120 lf east of the proposed S Trails Blanco Meter site.  To accomplish the tie in would then require about 120 lf of 20 inch (or perhaps 12 inch) pipeline, parallel to the right of way corridor that Questar has already acquired from TW for the extension to WFS Milagro.  The custody transfer meter facilities and any control facilities would then be installed on the Questar site.  TW stated that pressure ranges between 928 to 950 psig in this  30 inch pipeline.  Agreement needs to be finalized on who installs the tap, pipeline tie in, and meter facilities.    It would be good if TW would agree that Questar could accomplish all work, with the exception of the tap of the 30 inch pipeline.  In any event, S Trails needs to contribute our meter parcel site for the location for meter facilities, whether TW or Questar installes these facilities.    The TW reps were going to convey this info to Ron Mathews of TW.   Conceptually, this location is as shown on the TW dwg, dated 11-26-01, prepared by RLM.  The Questar group is also determining how the parcel size can be expanded, from the current 75 by 100 to about 100 by 125, to accomodate all these facilities.

"Kim-  As I had mentioned, I'd like to find a time we could meet with your group to discuss Marketing's 2002 needs, wants, priorities, etc..  I just want to be sure that Planning doesn't waste any of the next few months going in a direction opposite to the commercial group.  I would plan on having Dennis, Mansoor, Perry and Ron attend, and could have Optimization represented as well if you'd like.  Obviously I'll be there, and Keller will come if he can.

"Steve,  FYI, the Risk Management and Reporting was allocated to TW for all 12 months of 2001.  However, since I came back to TW in May, Lee Ferrell left Enron in June and Sean and Richard moved to Jo's RC in November, the 15% number dwindled during the latter part of the year.

Today's News=09  Allegheny Energy Supply Company, Salt River  Project and Sempra Energy Res= ources Announce Open Season for Proposed  Desert Crossing Gas Storage and T= ransportation System   [IMAGE]  [IMAGE]  [IMAGE]  [IMAGE]    PHOENIX, Jan. = 10 /PRNewswire/ -- The Desert Crossing Gas Storage and Transportation Syste= m (Desert Crossing) is holding an Open Season for customers interested in c= apacity, beginning today and extending through Feb. 8, 2002.     Open Seaso= n is a process in which customers interested in acquiring natural gas stora= ge capacity in a storage facility, and/or transmission capacity on a pipeli= ne, submit bids setting out the terms under which they will agree to purcha= se the capacity.     Upon completion of the project, the Desert Crossing sy= stem will include a 10 billion cubic foot, high-deliverability natural gas = storage complex and associated pipeline, located in the Hualapai Valley, no= rth of Kingman, Arizona.  The associated pipeline, spanning roughly 300 mil= es from outside of Las Vegas to Southwestern Arizona, is projected to be an=  800 million cubic feet per day system that will connect the storage comple= x with all of the major interstate natural gas pipelines in Arizona and sou= thern Nevada (see map of proposed system at http://www.desert-crossing.com = ).     Project sponsors Allegheny Energy Supply Company, the generation and=  trading subsidiary of Allegheny Energy, Inc. (NYSE: AYE ); Salt River Proj= ect (SRP); and Sempra Energy Resources, a unit of Sempra Energy (NYSE: SRE = ), said that Desert Crossing will provide a consumer-driven, market-respons= ive storage and pipeline system to serve the growing needs of the southwest= ern United States for power and peak period gas supplies. Limitations on na= tural gas transportation and storage in Arizona and southern Nevada, along = with past and projected increases in gas demand by consumers in the region,=  have resulted in market conditions that make this storage and pipeline pro= ject attractive.     ""As proposed, this project with its north-south pipeli= ne configuration will be uniquely situated to increase shippers' and consum= ers' options for sourcing natural gas and to provide new transportation cap= acity to the Arizona and southern Nevada markets,"" commented Michael Morrel= l, president, Allegheny Energy Supply Company. ""The increased storage and t= ransportation capacity will enhance energy reliability at cost-effective pr= ices, which is good news for consumers and shippers of natural gas.""      S= RP's associate general manager of power, construction & engineering, David = Areghini, concurred.  ""As we continue to diversify our fuel sources by addi= ng new gas-fired power plants, it is important that we increase our ability=  to obtain the necessary amount of natural gas supplies.  The Desert Crossi= ng project will help ensure an economical and clean energy source for consu= mers and others in the Southwest for many years.""     ""The additional natur= al gas supplies will help balance the region's escalating energy demands, e= specially those of electric generators, as well as provide the potential to=  help reduce future price spikes in the Southwest,"" said Dwain Boettcher, v= ice president of planning and analysis for Sempra Energy Resources. ""The ho= urly scheduling flexibility built into the proposed tariff was designed to = transform the way storage service is offered in the future.""     Customers = participating in the Open Season and awarded capacity will have unprecedent= ed flexibility with respect to gaining access to the markets and diverse ga= s supplies in the Southwest.  These customers will be able to optimize thei= r portfolios, because Desert Crossing will be situated at the Southwest's e= nergy crossroads.     The project is subject to obtaining all necessary reg= ulatory approvals and sufficient commitments from third parties during the = Open Season.

JTW.  -----Original Message----- From: clarencekerley [mailto:Bill@bkspeaks.com] Sent: Friday, January 11, 2002 8:45 AM To: ordinarylife@yahoogroups.com Subject: [ordinarylife] One Family's Story   ORDINARY LIFE - Thoughts and Ideas To Help You Live a Happier Life  ======================================  PREVIEW for January 13, 2002  ======================================  Dear Folks -     I mentioned to you a few weeks ago that nothing divides the  Christian church in the Western world any more than views on how to  interpret the Bible. On the one hand there is either the natural or  conscious literal approach and, on the other, the mytho-poetic  approach. The topics over which various groups within the Christian  tradition have the most controversy are views about creation,  homosexuality and the historic Jesus.     We will have a first-hand opportunity to explore one of these - the  issue of homosexuality - this Sunday as a mother and daughter share  with us their story.     Jennifer Feather grew up in the St. Paul's community. Her mother,  SuZanne Feather, has been very active at St. Paul's.     The Ordinary Life Gathering will combine with the Point of View  Class this Sunday to hear these two women share their experience. About  what they will be doing, Jennifer writes this:     ""Religion is a fundamentally communal experience. Shared beliefs and  rituals form its foundations. However, the practice of our faith is  also inextricably bound to our own personal experience. Our individual  relationship to God is as important as our communal experience of  religion. Our differences from one another make the competing demands  of individuality and community evident.     ""Sexuality has become a divisive issue in the Church precisely  because it brings to light these difficulties.     ""Having grown-up at St. Paul's, the interplay between individual  difference and this community has shaped my experience of my faith.     ""Join me and my mother, SuZanne, as we share with you our story and  explore the implications of sexuality for our understanding of  religious community and the place of difference within that community.""                 * * *     We will skip having refreshments at the beginning of our time  together this week only.     DON'T FORGET - this Sunday only we'll be meeting in the Activities  Center.     I look forward to seeing you this Sunday.  Much love,  Bill Kerley  ======================================  Ordinary Life is a gathering that provides an opportunity to develop an  enlightened heart and an awakened mind to the reality of the present  moment.  The gathering meets on Sunday mornings at 9:45 am in Fondren Hall at  St. Paul's UMC - 5501 South Main, Houston, Texas and is taught by Dr.  Bill Kerley.

Due to several continuing and cumulative negative factors, we are re-forecasting the project schedule.  The forecasted dates are now:  * Station 1 15 June 2002 (was 1 June) * Station 2 15 June 2002 (was 1 June) * Station 3 1 July 2002 (was 22 June)  Factors which previously impacted the schedule include late air permits and the inability to start construction due to the contractors' unwillingness to work on credit.  Please recall that we were originally scheduled to start construction in mid-October, but were delayed about six weeks due to the air permits.  Permits were received and construction scheduled to start in early December, when the bankruptcy / advanced payment issues caused the contractors to delay the start.  Factors which continue to impact the project are  * Lack of materials causing lack of construction progress.  Several vendors and contractors continue to delay until they receive payment; due to a lack of cash, some payment needs identified in December are just now being paid.  The table below indicates the lag in payments. * Nuovo Pignone unit testing delay (only affects unit 3). * Winter weather - not out of the ordinary, but we are impacted by trying to do civil work during winter weather.  Our original plan was to be complete with civil work before winter.  The dates above are based on resolution of the material delivery items immediately.  Further delay in vendor payments / material deliveries could impact the dates further.  We have considered many alternatives to minimize construction schedule, and are doing those that are feasible at this time.  They include  * maximum piping pre-fabrication * early tie-in at Station 2 * geotech experts on site to immediately approve variations in construction specifications * installation of tents to enable civil construction  We will continue to evaluate schedule-enhancing activities and may be able to take additional steps at the appropriate phases of construction (e.g., working 2 shifts when the work can be done safely at night, and having Nuovo Pignone representatives on site early).

If Devon doesn't cash out and they do not lower nominations on this point, then we will have to explore other options to get this gas/$$$$.    Amy will continue to follow up with Devon and pursue cashing out.    thanks Richard  ",mark.mcconnell@enron.com,kimberly.watson@enron.com,FW: Devon SFS,2002-01-14 08:58:38-08:00,sent

I had a wrong date in it.  Thanks. Lynn  The following is the procedure Gas Logistics and Marketing have agreed to beginning this weekend to segregate the TW and NNG morning meeting.   1.  TW will have their morning meeting in EB1336 Mondy through Friday at 8:00 a.m. beginning, Monday, January 21, 2002. TW schedulers will attend this meeting. 2.  Gas Logistics will be sure either Steve January, Darrell Schoolcraft or Gary Spraggins is in attendance for Gas Control and either Lynn Blair, Terry Kowalke or John Buchanan is in attendance for scheduling discussions. 3.  On Fridays at 3:00 p.m., beginning Friday, January 18 , 2002, there will be a meeting in EB1336 to review any TW issues for the weekend.  Marketing and Gas Logistics will be in attendance. 4.  Beginning this weekend, Saturday, January 12, 2002,  on Saturday and Sunday, if there are any TW issues that need to be discuss, Gas Logistics will call the appropriate Marketing On Call person after the NNG 8:00 morning meeting. 5.  NNG will continue to have their Marketing/Gas Logistics morning meeting in EB42C2 Monday through Friday and the Conference call at 8:00 a.m. on Satruday and Sunday. 6.  The TW Schedulers will attend the meeting at EB1336 Monday through Friday.  On Saturday and Sunday, they will be in the NNG morning meeting conference call and stay on the line for the TW meeting if it is necessary to have one.  We are continuing to include the TW schedulers on the conference call due to discussions about system issues which impact both pipelines.   If anyone has any questions, or would like to discuss any changes, please let Kim Watson or I know and we can certainly look at other options.     I apologize this did not get started this last Friday, but I believe everyone has it on their calendars now.   Thanks for everyones help and support to come up with a solution that hopefully works for all.

"Kim,   This looks fine. The only change I have is to Section 2.8. I think a word got left out. It should read ""by providing to THE other party"". Other than that, it looks fine. I think our right of way department should have a standard lease or easement agreement that they like to use. If not, let me know and I'll search around here for one. We really should have a separate document for the lease/easement and not fold it into the interconnect agreement.     -----Original Message----- From:  Watson, Kimberly   Sent: Monday, January 14, 2002 5:22 PM To: Rapp, Bill Subject: Questar  Hi Bill,  Sorry for the confusion.  If you don't mind, please take a look at this contract.  I have not heard back from facility planning yet, but I do think that we are leaning towards leasing the ROW from Questar for this interconnect.  If this is true, do we have standard language that we can add to this agreement to reflect such arrangement?    Thanks for your help.  Did you see the change in para 3.2 and 4.4?

There is no way I can give a summary of the two touching and brilliant presentations that were given in the Ordinary Life Gathering this past Sunday.     SuZanne and Jennifer Feather gave their individual perspectives and experiences on dealing with Jennifer's discovery and announcement of being lesbian.     Over 150 people attended the presentation.     When SuZanne and Jennifer were finished they got a well-deserved standing ovation.     If you were present you saw examples of courage and love that moved many to tears. Courage and love are, in my opinion, what the spiritual journey is all about.     Audio tapes of the presentation will be available this coming week. If you live out of town, one can be sent to you. The best way to expedite this, if you want a tape, would be to send a check to me for $6.00 made payable to Ordinary Life Gathering. I'll make sure you get a tape as soon as possible.                 * * *     Those of you in Houston might be interested in this:     This Thursday evening at seven o'clock my beautiful bride, Dr. Sherry Beeman, and I will be conducting a relationship seminar sponsored by St. Paul's School.

The seminar is free but they do request that you register by phone so they will know how many to prepare for. The number is 713-528-6779.

First, for what is coming up:     Over the past several years our relationship with our sister church  in Cochabamba, Bolivia has been growing stronger. The Ordinary Life  gathering has provided, for several years now, scholarships for people  who wanted to go do building and medical work there. As you know, one  of St. Paul's clergy - Diane Wimberly - is spending a year there. Two  other folks in our community, Dr. Wilson and Nora Boots, go regularly  to work there. Year before last we provided a substantial amount of  money to help complete building a medical clinic there.     Now they have specifically, through Diane, turned to us with an  appeal for assistance. In order to give you the information needed to  make a decision about this, I've asked Richard Wingfield to come and  speak to us about his two trips there.     He will be showing photos and videos of the work there and  explaining to us some of what the need is. I'll read you Diane's letter  to our gathering. There will also be an opportunity for you to see if  making the next trip to Bolivia is something you would like to  participate in.     I sincerely hope you'll come to learn about and provide feedback on  this important work.  Much love,  Bill Kerley  ======================================     At our last gathering I spoke about the responses to the  questionnaire that was posted here last September. We had a high  percentage of returns and each questionnaire was carefully analyzed.  Edward Harris did an enormous amount of work putting this questionnaire  together and analyzing it. After hearing the responses last week, we  had some dialogue about the future direction of Ordinary Life. It was  very helpful to me and I thank those of you who were present.     Then I talked about the importance of questions, told a story about  the most important question of all, and left you with a couple of major  one's to ponder. What follows is a full text of that part of our time  together.  ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++            The Big Question(s)  ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++     Here is a prayer someone sent me:     I want to thank you, Lord, for being close to me so far this day.  With your help, I haven't been impatient, grumpy, judgmental, or  envious with anyone. But I will be getting out of bed in a minute and I  think that I will really need your help then. Amen     We do need all the help we can get, don't we? One of the ways help  comes to us, but which we don't usually recognize, is through  questions.     For example:    Are you here with a purpose?     What would have to happen for this time we spend together today to  be a worthy investment of your time?     I'm always wondering about things like that.     [What followed at this point of a summary of the questionnaire  responses and dialogue about that.]     Questions are very important. Every morning when you get up, you  start your day with questions. At least this seems to be the case.  Perhaps the first one is, ""Is it really time to get up? Seems like I  just went to sleep.""     Then they begin:     ""What am I going to wear?""    ""What's for breakfast?""    ""Will I be in time for the meeting?""    ""How am I going to get it all done today?""    ""Who will prepare supper tonight?""    ""How's the market doing?""     Perhaps one of the things that differentiates is the quality of  questions we ask ourselves.     I want to read you the story of the most significant question you  can ask - of yourself or of someone else.     This is an old, old story. This version of it comes from Dawna  Markova's wonderful book, ""I Will Not Die an Unlived Life.""     Immediately after her father died, she realized that even in his own  opinion, he had not really lived his life but merely existed. As part  of her grieving, this poem came out of her -     I will not die an unlived life.    I will not live in fear    of falling or catching fire.    I choose to inhabit my days,    To allow my living to open me,    To make me less afraid,    More accessible;    To loosen my heart    Until it becomes a wing,    A torch, a promise.    I choose to risk my significance,    To live so that which came to be as seed    Goes to the next as blossom,    And that which came to me as blossom,    Goes on as fruit.     It is very important when you hear this story to hear it as a  parable, a metaphor, about your inner life and living. If you want to  pursue this more, read Robert Johnson's book ""He."" By the way, Robert  Johnson's biography is out and I highly recommend it as supplementary  reading to what these gatherings are all about. The title of that book  is ""Balancing Heaven and Earth."" It will both inform and inspire you.     Now, here is the story:     ""In the center of space and time, there lived a king in a castle.  His name was Arthur, and he had been mortally wounded. Though his heart  sill pumped blood, he never left his chamber, for he had fallen under  an evil spell. He no longer cared a whit for the fortunes of his people  or his lands. All of his kingdom lay fallow. Everyone's souls seemed to  be suspended. The people went about their daily tasks lethargically, as  if they were all in a trance of some kind. They had lost all sense of  purpose.     ""The story now shifts to a cottage in the woods not far from the  castle. A very naive, fatherless young man name Parsifal had just come  of age. While walking through the forest, he encountered a bevy of the  king's knights riding along the road. He was so awestruck by their  shining appearance that he immediately wished to become one such as  they. Over the objections of his very strict mother, Herzelaide, he set  off for the castle.     ""Parsifal was struck dumb, however when he reached King Arthur's  castle. Instead of the glorious Camelot he had expected, he found  himself in the middle of a wasteland, where everything was sterile. He  discovered that the king had been wounded in the groin, and had lost  the power of re-generation. The King's courtiers, moving about  listless, did nothing about the terrible situation that had befallen  them.     ""Parsifal was given a horse and weapons so he could battle with a  formidable knight who had bested all of Arthur's champions.  Astonishingly, Parsifal won and took the armor of the fearsome foe.  Some said it was mere luck, but the consensus was that the young man's  innocence conferred a divine blessing on him.     ""Parsifal wanted desperately to help his king, but he, like everyone  else, had no answers as to how to heal the wound. His mind was filled  with questions, which flowed from the gift of his innocence, but he  dammed them up, remembering his mother's constant injunction not to  embarrass people by asking questions. And so Parsifal left the count on  a quest for the Holy Grail.     ""The legend then relates how he ventured down many a blind path and  false trail in his search, but finally he glimpsed the Grail and, as a  result, felt the King's pain in his own heart. On the first of May, he  rode his magnificent white charger back to Arthur's castle. He rushed  to his king, who was at Death's door. With compassion in his heart, he  overcame his previous hesitance and knelt beside his monarch. A  question rose to his lips and spilled over as it were wine.     ""'What aileth thee?' A blinding light flashed, and in an instant the  spell was broken. The king's heath was restored, the land and all its  inhabitants were renewed. Arthur and the other members of the court  turned to Parsifal and in honoring him, the King gave this toast, 'If  you falter, never forget, that verily every day holds the promise of a  new redemption!'""     Questions can be dangerous. They can take you to and over the edge  of the safe world we normally live in.     ""Is my spirit dying in my marriage?""    ""What is my life really about?""    ""Will I die an unlived life?""     All new and original thought begins with a question.     Can we embrace the unanswered? Can we live in the mystery?     Here is a very important question for you to ask yourself:     ""What is likely to happen to me if I keep living my life exactly as  I am?""     And, then:     ""Is that what I want?""     So here are two questions I leave with you:     The first is by Meister Eckhart and was written several hundred  years ago:     ""What good is it to me if Mary gave birth to the son of God fourteen  hundred years ago and I do not give birth to the child of God in my  time and in my culture? We are all meant to be mothers of God. For God  is always needing to be born.""     The next question comes from Mother Teresa:     ""What do we live for if not to make life less difficult for each  other?""     The answers to these and other questions stirred in your today will,  of course, have to come from you.     No matter where you go this week, no matter what happens, remember  this: You are carrying precious cargo. Watch your step.  ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++  Ordinary Life is a gathering that provides an opportunity to develop an  enlightened heart and an awakened mind to the reality of the present  moment.

Team, please make arrangements with Darryl and Gallup to dry pig the lateral.  After dry pigging we would like to take another look at the lateral to insure eff.'s are still low before proceeding with spending the dollars to reapply the DRA.  You might also touch base with the contractor to check availability for the April/May time frame.    Vera/Tim, we will keep you advised of the schedule to insure plan dollars remain in the appropriate month.  Ben, can you provide estimated volumes to Jerry for scheduling purposes assuming that like last time we have to pig between 5 to 7 mph to apply the DRA.    As we move forward and following the dry pigging results we will set up a conf. call to better coordinate activities as necessary.

Tiny, The Ignacio line efficiencies are still unacceptably low. We've also seen about a 2-3 % decrease in line efficiencies on the Bloomfield to Gallup segment (particularly the Bloomfield-Bisti section) since we applied the DRA last spring.  It will be a good idea to pig and re-apply  the Bloomfield-Gallup section again in April, and hopefully have the launcher and receiver installed for the Ignacio line in the fall (I understand the pipeline integrity group will cover this cost).  If there are no concerns or issues I suggest we go ahead and plan for these.

Ben, need to know how the San Juan Lateral eff. is holding up so that we can better estimate when O&M budgets may be impacted this year from pigging type activities.

"FYI.  ILY.  SYT.  JTW.  -----Original Message----- From: clarencekerley [mailto:Bill@bkspeaks.com] Sent: Tuesday, January 29, 2002 10:40 AM To: ordinarylife@yahoogroups.com Subject: [ordinarylife] An Appeal from Bolivia   ORDINARY LIFE - Thoughts and Ideas to Help You Live a Happier Life  ======================================  Summary of January 27, 2002  ======================================  Dear Folks -     This on-line newsletter offering previews and summaries of the Ordinary Life gathering now goes to almost 800 people all over the United States and in at least three foreign countries that I know of. I am both delighted and stunned that my rantings are useful to so many.     Of course, I hope what I have to teach has universal applicability even though it is spoken to a group of 100 to 120 folks in Houston each week. Sometimes things are more meaningful to the local gathering. That may be the case for what happened this past Sunday. Then, again, maybe not. Read on ?     Richard Wingfield put together a moving and informative video about work that the Ordinary Life gathering has had a stake in for some years now. We have sent both people and money to our ""sister"" church in Cochabamba, Bolivia. I want to quote at length from a letter sent to the Ordinary Life gathering by Wilson Boots. He was on the video shown Sunday.     ""I trust that you have had opportunity to see the video record filmed by Richard Wingfield of the dedication of the health clinic at Emmanuel Methodist in Cochabamba, Bolivia. It was a wonderful day, filled with hope for the host of church and community people who gathered to celebrate this special moment. With much gratitude we expressed heartfelt thanks for the vision and commitment of the Ordinary Life Class that through your special offing made possible the construction of this community health center. It's location adjacent to the back wall of our small church sanctuary symbolizes in a special way the profound Gospel dimensions of the healing and health that are shared here daily in the lives of very poor people of the community.     ""It will be of interest to you to know that the small room where Rev. Diane Wimberley is living during her year of service with Emmanuel is just thirty feet away from this modest clinic. Diane is involved daily in ministry with the dedicated community M.D. and nurse who provide such excellent care for so many children, women and men who have no other possibilities for medical care due to their situation of poverty and absence of other health care alternatives.     ""This is a time of serious crisis, however, for this medical outreach ministry. Due to the general economic crisis in Bolivia, and the ending of financial support for the Doctor and nurse due to the unusual circumstances of the international organization that has been giving support, the work of this medical outpost has been seriously curtailed. In fact, if minimal monthly funding cannot be made available for at least a few months until some alternative grant can be secured, it is the real possibility that the clinic will be closed.     ""I want to ask your consideration for the possibility of some immediate support of this urgent need.""     Diane Wimberley sent a letter to Richard Wingfield in which she also explains the situation. I cites parts of it:     ""One of the things that I am writing about is a need for money. The center is in bad shape. The doc is having to cut his hours back in order to take another job - a situation caused both by the situation here and his practice not pulling in what it should due to the economic crisis in the country.     ""He is a rare one who is deeply committed to this center and everything that it stands for. He recruits other doc's in the city to volunteer, works on soliciting other clients. He basically has told me that his life was changed by the center when he began and nothing can make him leave it now. So he will work three jobs: for the government which he hates, for the university, in his private practice and come here 2 hours in the middle of the day. He is completely committed to helping children and their families. ""     Diane states that up until this crisis he was being paid $250 a month by the center. That is the amount she is asking for from Ordinary Life.     I have gotten both calls and e-mails from folks after last Sunday indicating that people are more than willing to see us do this - or perhaps even more. We didn't have time to discuss this Sunday but I wanted you to have this information and we'll talk about it when we gather this week.     Thanks again to Richard Wingfield for doing such an outstanding job bringing us the story.  Much love,  Bill Kerley  ======================================  Ordinary Life is a gathering that provides an opportunity to develop an enlightened heart and an awakened mind to the reality of the present moment.  The gathering meets on Sunday mornings at 9:45 am in Fondren Hall at St. Paul's UMC - 5501 South Main, Houston, Texas and is taught by Dr. Bill Kerley.

"Steve,  Here is the pricing information on the DTN feed.  I recommend that we sign a 3 year agreement so the initial fee of $1,000 will be waived.  The minimum DTN fee is $500 monthly (for up to 25 users) plus $60 monthly for the 1st user and $12 monthly for users 2-25.  Do you want to see the real-time feeds?  It looks like the total monthly fee will be $620 for six users.    Please let me know if you have any concerns, otherwise, we will implement ASAP.  Also, there will be no additional cost to have this on the 13 floor and move it to our final destination (there used to be a large fee for moving locations).

I know 2002 was supposed to be better than 2001, but we are off to an imperfect start up here in the hills.  I totaled my Red Racer yesterday [subject to insurance adjuster's certification, of course].  Man, we were supposed to grow old[er] together and all that stuff and it was just getting broken in good @ 124,000 miles and it just gobbled up and zipped up, down and around all these hills like it owned them [which it did].  No ""zipping"" was going on yesterday, I will testify.  And now Janell thinks we should get a ""tankier"" replacement to protect against these old geezers who have now proven they can get in my way.  No serious damage to either driver [I know the other guy].  Just my first experience with air bag explosion and associated abrasions and broken heart from losing my old red buddy.  I made the stupid mistake of telling mom I was only in a coma for ""a couple of hours"", and now I will have to work to get that image out of her head, but, hey, I am not myself, I had a big wreck.  I shall, of course, exploit that sentiment to the max.  When I went out in the garage today to run Janell to work and my car wasn't there, it was not a good moment, but I am being very, very brave.  I went out last night and bought a new computer rig to cheer me up and next tuesday I will get cable modem internet connection, so we will be cookin' up here in the woods.  I have always had state of the art PCs, but have never had to buy one before.  My bosses used to do that, but they seemed to have stopped now for reasons I must investigate.  I also upgraded my hotmailbox to 10mb, so you can send me tons of funny graphics without it choking now. I wanted to get DSL, but SWBell doesn't offer it here yet, and the cable boys beat them to the punch by finally completing their fibre optic intalls, so I had to go that way to get speedier.  Oh well, we're ahead of Afhanistan up here in technology, but probably won't be after we finish spending billions of our $$$ over there.

For Sure?   ORDINARY LIFE - Thoughts and Ideas To Help You Live a Happier Life  ======================================  PREVIEW for February 3, 2002  ======================================  Dear Folks -     Wow! What a ton of feedback I've gotten from the past two Sundays. I'll share that with you this week. Most of it is about the presentation on our work in Bolivia. Some of it about community- building.     Some of the more ""theological/theoretical"" questions I've gotten have to do with the general area of ""how do we know what we know and how do we know if it is true?""     If our goal is to take the journey of life in such a way that we do not die an unlived life, how do we know that the choices we make about being and doing are correct and true?     A couple of years ago there was a movement that attempted to answer this question by the phrase WWJD - What Would Jesus Do? What, for example, would Jesus do about the terrorist attacks on 9/11?   Then there were the copycats of that position - What Would Buddha Do? etc. My beautiful bride suggested WWGUD - What Would A Grown-Up Do?     This week when we gather I want to talk with you about these terribly important matters ?       How Do We Know - For Sure                  And            How Do We Decide?     I hope you choose to be present.  Much love,   Bill Kerley  ======================================  Ordinary Life is a gathering that provides an opportunity to develop an enlightened heart and an awakened mind to the reality of the present moment.  The gathering meets on Sunday mornings at 9:45 am in Fondren Hall at St. Paul's UMC - 5501 South Main, Houston, Texas and is taught by Dr. Bill Kerley.

The deal was structured whereby TW would receive a marketing fee equal to 50% of the rate negotiated in excess of the original contracted rate between ENA and TW; the other 50% goes to ENA.  Here's the basics: ENA's contract with TW is at a daily rate of $0.0600 (one-part) The release to Burlington is at a daily rate of $0.0650 (demand only plus applicable commodity and fuel based on usage) TW will bill Burlington through normal course of business (reservation of $34,125 [$0.0650 x 25,000 x 21days] plus applicable commodity fees) ENA demand invoice will need to be adjusted so that they only receive a capacity release credit of $32,812.50  [($0.0650 - $0.0025) x 25,000 x 21days] TW will need to book marketing fee revenues of $1,312.50 [$0.0025 x 25,000 x 21 days]  (Richard - do we need/have a separate account for these revenues??)  Michelle - I know you indicated that ENA is looking to get a payment of $1,312.50 for their portion of the incremental fee charged.  However, we will need to discuss further.  The invoice that will be generated to ENA will not represent a credit due them since we would still be billing them for the first 11 days prior to this release.    We can discuss further when the billing cycle approaches.  If you have any questions, please let me know.

ORDINARY LIFE - Thoughts and Ideas to Help You Live a Happier Life  ======================================  Summary of February 3, 2002  ======================================  Dear Folks ?     First of all thanks to all of you who responded to the need for financial help in our medical work in Bolivia. I can't recall experiencing such generosity. We are going to be able to give them more than they requested. Plus, several people are already on the list to go down with the next work crew and one person is going to help arrange getting medical supplies to the clinic. Wow! Thanks.     The material I offered focused on how our Western approach to ""the truth"" and how modernity have had destructive effects on our religious and spiritual well being. We have become ""fact fundamentalists."" I also deal with the perplexing question of what Jesus might do in dealing with terrorism. The lesson ends with a telling of an ancient story from Ethiopia about the battle between Truth and Falsehood.     What follows is a full text of the presentation.  ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++  Is The Story You're Telling With Your Life the Truth?  ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++     A boat docked in a tiny Mexican village. An American tourist complimented the Mexican fisherman on the quality of his fish and asked how long it took him to catch them.     ""Not very long,"" answered the Mexican.     ""But then, why didn't you stay out longer and catch more?"" asked the American.     The Mexican explained that his small catch was sufficient to meet his needs and those of his family.     The American asked, ""But what do you do with the rest of your time?""     ""I sleep late, fish a little, play with my children, and take a siesta with my wife. In the evenings, I go into the village to see my friends, have a few drinks, play the guitar, and sing a few songs. I have a full life.""     The American interrupted, ""I have an MBA from Harvard and I can help you!     ""You should start by fishing longer every day. You can then sell the extra fish you catch. With the extra revenue, you can buy a bigger boat. With the extra money the larger boat will bring, you can buy a second one and a third one and so on until you have an entire fleet of trawlers.     ""Instead of selling your fish to a middleman, you can negotiate directly with the processing plants and maybe even open your own plant. You can then leave this little village and move to Mexico City, Los Angeles, or even New York City! From there you can direct your huge enterprise.""     ""How long would that take?"" asked the Mexican.     ""Twenty, perhaps twenty-five years,"" replied the American.     ""And after that?""     ""Afterwards? That's when it gets really interesting,"" answered the American, laughing. ""When your business gets really big, you can start selling stocks and make millions!""     ""Millions? Really? And after that?""     ""After that you'll be able to retire, live in a tiny village near the coast, sleep late, play with your children, catch a few fish, take a siesta, and spend your evenings drinking and enjoying your friends!""     Ordinary Life auditor Wayne Herbert sent me that and it is just a wonderful story about the kinds of things I want us to be about.     I sometimes refer to what wants to happen in here with the phrase ""Journey Into Wholeness."" It is so easy for those of us in the West to think that that journey is out there somewhere, in the outer world. The goal of spiritual work is to become a ""self."" Or, to become aware of the Self. I can't adequately explain to you what this self is. It is the center and, at the same time, the circumference of the personality. It embraces both consciousness and unconsciousness. The Self is known as the Christ in Christianity.     Journey into Wholeness. The root meaning of the word ""holiness"" is this wholeness. Wholeness involves finding the missing parts or the faculties that are lacking in our natures and restoring them to a dignified place in our personality. Usually for those of us in the Western world our need, as reflected in the story of the Mexican fisherman, is relatedness; relatedness to ourselves as well as to others. This is the principle of equality I've spoken to you about so often. We who speak English are limited to one word for ""love."" In Sanskrit there are ninety-six words for love. We are highly specialized in technology yet quite primitive in terms of feelings.     Jesus, and other Eastern spiritual teachers, saw the outer world to be of little importance. The place where the kingdom of God was was inside and among us. For us, however, reality is in the outer, material, physical world. One of the ways this has affected Christian theology is the emphasis on a belief that we are so unique, so distinctive that even our bodies persist on the other side of death. The religion out of which we came, Judaism, thought that after death what happened to us was much like what happens to a dewdrop after the sunrise. Yes, it has individuality while it exists as a separate entity, but it is destined quite quickly to flow back into the great primal ocean of existence and to lose all individuality. Does a drop of water cease to exist when it falls back into the sea? Well, yes and no. Nothing is lost but its individuality is no more. Jesus knew that the ego was a great troublemaker for us.     We cling to everything that we think defines us as individuals. To threaten this notion of who we are is hell. We protect what we call our individuality at all costs. Death is bearable only if we are guaranteed a life after death containing all the characteristics of our individual human life.     You can see how this would affect the way we go about living our lives and making choices about who we are and what are we to do. Those were the questions that shaped, by the way, what became our Bible. After every great cultural upheaval the community of people raised the questions: Who are we and what are we to do?     e.e. cummings once wrote, ""To be yourself in a world that is doing its best to make you everybody else means to fight the hardest battle any human being can fight, and never stop fighting.""     I love the story of the Pentecostal man who wandered into, let us say, a Methodist church. During the sermon, the visitor got so excited that whenever the preacher made a point, the Pentecostal man would scream out, ""Praise God!"" or ""Hallelujah!"" or ""Amen!"" The ushers were so distraught about the Pentecostal's behavior that the head usher went down the aisle and whispered to him: ""You'll have to keep quiet? The pastor's right in the middle of the sermon!"" The Pentecostal man said, ""Keep quiet? How can I keep quiet? I've got the Holy Spirit!"" To which the usher said, ""Well, you didn't get it in this church!""     The Pentecostal man made a theological error that many of us make. You see, he didn't have the Holy Spirit; the Holy Spirit had him! And that's the problem with much of our theology. We wish he had the Holy Spirit. There's a part of us that wishes we could keep the Holy Spirit in the nice, neat, tidy confines of our categories and barriers. We'd like to put God in a box.     Get this: Nobody has the Holy Spirit; the Holy Spirit always has us and, given our Western orientation, that scares us so that we resist and repress and deny until we are spiritual dead as doornails. We want a God in a box like we want everything else in our lives predictable and controllable. We want a religion that is safe. A journey that is predictable. There is no true spiritual journey that is that way.     We modern people have been victimized by own modernity. Of course, we've benefited - we have the sciences, technology, modern medicine, even emphases on human rights come from our modern approach to things. But it has had two deeply destructive effects on our religious and spiritual life.     For one thing it has made people skeptical about spiritual reality. If God can't be proved by modern means, then God must not be.     Second, modernity has led us to be preoccupied with factuality - with scientifically verifiable and historically reliable facts. Modern Western culture is the only culture in human history that has identified truth with factuality. We are, as Marcus Borg calls us, ""fact fundamentalists."" If a statement isn't scientifically or historically factual, it isn't true. These two things are serious mistakes and deadly to the journey inward.     Let me point out that both liberals and conservatives can be fact fundamentalists. Liberals try to rescue a few facts from the fire. Conservatives say the Bible must be factually true in order to be true at all. This is why they emphasize the literal and historical factuality of biblical texts. They both agree - facts are what matters.     If I had a magic wand that worked, one of the things I would do is to get both liberals and conservatives alike to see how modern both of these positions are.     What we've got when it comes to having faith today for most people is whether they can believe ""iffy"" things or not. That, to most people, is what Christianity has become. It is as if what God wants most from us is believing highly problematic statements to be factually true. And, if you can't believe them, then you don't ""have faith"" and probably aren't a Christian.     Listen carefully: Faith has to do with your relation to God, to Self. Not whether you believe the Bible to be true or not.     I'm going to come back to this in the weeks ahead.     Let me see if I can give you an example. One of the questions that has persistently come up in the discussion group has to do with what Jesus' view on violence might be. This has been raised since the events of 9/11. What would Jesus have us do? Does professing to be Christian mean trying to live as Christ might live? And if so, why aren't we doing what he asks us to do?     First of all, I confess I have not a clue what Jesus would do in response to 9/11. My hunch is not much. His interest was not in that sort of thing. Besides, he had little political power.     If we went to him and asked, I think he would probably tell a story. He might tell the story of the Good Iranian Terrorist. That's what the parable of the Good Samaritan sounded like to the people of his time.     ""Who are you he might ask?"" Then tell a story to us as we stand there with our mouths open and scratching our heads.     Maybe he would tell a story like this:     One day a rabbi, in a frenzy of religious passion, rushed in before the ark, fell to his knees, and started beating his breast, crying, ""I'm nobody! I'm nobody!"" The cantor of the synagogue, impressed by this example of spiritual humility, joined the rabbi on his knees. ""I'm nobody!  I'm nobody!"" The custodian, watching from the corner, couldn't restrain himself, either. He joined the other two on his knees, calling out, ""I'm nobody! I'm nobody!"" At which point the rabbi, nudging the cantor with his elbow, pointed at the custodian and said, ""Look who thinks he's nobody!""     I'll tell you something that might be misunderstood. I think that one of the numbers that organized religion has done on us is to convince us that we are supposed to be like Jesus. What God is interested in is saving human beings. That being the case what we must do is be human. The Christian conspiracy, I'm going to call it, against being human is to convince us that what we are supposed to do is be like Jesus.     A couple of years ago there was a popular slogan: WWJD. The goal was to ask before doing any and everything, ""What would Jesus do?""     If Jesus were here today, would he have worked for Enron? Would he have been on the board of directors? If Jesus were here today, would he go to church? Which one? The image that I had of Jesus when I grew up was that Jesus would not go to movies on Sunday but he would go swimming because we had a lot of water in our town. Would he be a Republican or a Democrat? Would he be involved in the political process?     The one thing that Jesus Christ was about was love and he did this by the extravagant way that he lived his life. He wasn't married; he didn't hold down a job; he didn't have to raise kids. The Roman church has it that Jesus was such a guy that not only did he not have a sexual dimension, neither did his mother.     What Jesus was about - and still is - is Love. The extravagant way that Jesus lived his life was to communicate the overwhelming love that God has for us. Boundless love. Inexpressible love. It is like God comes down and puts arms around us and says, ""This is how much I love you. Now love yourself like that."" This was the thing that marked the ministry of Jesus. So Soren Kierkegaard writes, ""To will to be that self which one truly is, is the opposite of despair.""     How do you do that? Well, to be the self you truly are is to have a particular history and it is to aspire to go beyond the limitations of that history and it is to be frustrated when you realize you can't. To accept this humanness means to be passionate about our aspirations and compassionate about our limitations. It is like you get up from where you're sitting and come up here and stand beside me physically and look at the person who is seated in the chair where you are and you have compassion for that person. It is that kind of acceptance.     We are not to be like Jesus. We are to be Christ-like. There is a world of difference.     Jesus went around kicking self-esteem into people. All of the stories that you find in the New Testament are like that. Look at the stories of his ministry. If a man can restore sight to a blind man, he gives that person a new lease on life, a new self-confidence. If a man can absolve a prostitute's guilt in lasting forgiveness, he gives her the gift of self-respect. The crippled, the insane, the leper, the tax collector, the beggar - a motley assortment of humanity desperately in need of self-esteem and he extended it to them.     The same dynamic was at work even when he was chasing the moneychangers out of the temple. It may be temporarily embarrassing to be kicked out of your accustomed place of business, but it has been known to lead to self-respect. The message is: You're made for something better than this. You are loved by God. This self-compassion is foundational for the abundant life and I'm sure that the response Jesus would have us make to the terrorist situation as well as the rest of life is this kind of love.     He would tell a story. One of his central teachings was: You shall know the Truth and the Truth shall set you free. (But first it's going to mess with your life and upset you!) So, let me tell you a story about Truth to ponder. This story is from the Ethiopian culture.     Long ago, Fire, Water, Truth, and Falsehood lived together in one large house. Although all were polite toward each other, they kept their distance. Truth and Falsehood sat on opposite sides of the room. Fire constantly leapt out of Water's path.     One day they went hunting together. They found a large number of cattle and began driving them home to their village. ""Let us share these cattle equally,"" said Truth as they traveled across the grasslands. ""This is the fair way to divine our captives.""     No one disagreed with Truth except Falsehood. Falsehood wanted more than an equal share but kept quiet about it for the moment. As the four hunters traveled back to the Village, Falsehood went secretly to Water and whispered, ""You are more powerful than Fire. Destroy Fire and then there will be more cattle for each of us!""     Water flowed over Fire, bubbling and steaming until Fire was gone. Water meandered along, cheerfully thinking about more cattle for itself.     Falsehood, meanwhile, whispered to Truth. ""Look! See for yourself! Water has killed Fire! Let us leave Water, who has cruelly destroyed our warmhearted friend. We must take the cattle high in the mountains to graze.""     As Truth and Falsehood traveled up the mountain, Water tried to follow. But the mountain was too steep; And Water could not flow upwards. Water washed down upon itself, splashing and swirling around rocks as it tumbled down the slope. Look and see! Water is still tumbling down the mountainside to this day.     Truth and Falsehood arrived at the mountaintop. Falsehood turned to Truth and said in a loud voice, ""I am more powerful than you! You will be my servant. I am your master. All the cattle belong to me!""     Truth rose up and spoke out, ""I will not be your servant!""     They battled and battled. Finally they brought the argument to Wind to decide who was the master.     Wind didn't know. Wind blew all over the world to ask people whether Truth or Falsehood was more powerful. Some people said, ""A single word of Falsehood can completely destroy Truth."" Others insisted, ""Like a small candle in the dark, Truth can change every situation.""     Wind finally returned to the mountain and said, ""I have seen that Falsehood is very powerful. But it can rule only where Truth has stopped struggling to be heard.""     And it has been that way ever since.     I think what Jesus would do if we asked him what we are to do is that he would likely tell a story. And then he would remind us that we ourselves are telling a story with our lives. After saying that, perhaps he would ask, ""Is the story you are telling with your life the truth?""     No matter where you go this week, no matter what happens, remember this: You are carrying precious cargo.

ORDINARY LIFE - Thoughts and Ideas to Help You Live a Happier Life  ======================================  Summary of February 3, 2002  ======================================  Dear Folks -     First of all thanks to all of you who responded to the need for financial help in our medical work in Bolivia. I can't recall experiencing such generosity. We are going to be able to give them more than they requested. Plus, several people are already on the list to go down with the next work crew and one person is going to help arrange getting medical supplies to the clinic. Wow! Thanks.     The material I offered focused on how our Western approach to ""the truth"" and how modernity have had destructive effects on our religious and spiritual well being. We have become ""fact fundamentalists."" I also deal with the perplexing question of what Jesus might do in dealing with terrorism. The lesson ends with a telling of an ancient story from Ethiopia about the battle between Truth and Falsehood.     What follows is a full text of the presentation.  ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++  Is The Story You're Telling With Your Life the Truth?  ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++     A boat docked in a tiny Mexican village. An American tourist complimented the Mexican fisherman on the quality of his fish and asked how long it took him to catch them.     ""Not very long,"" answered the Mexican.     ""But then, why didn't you stay out longer and catch more?"" asked the American.     The Mexican explained that his small catch was sufficient to meet his needs and those of his family.     The American asked, ""But what do you do with the rest of your time?""     ""I sleep late, fish a little, play with my children, and take a siesta with my wife. In the evenings, I go into the village to see my friends, have a few drinks, play the guitar, and sing a few songs. I have a full life.""     The American interrupted, ""I have an MBA from Harvard and I can help you!     ""You should start by fishing longer every day. You can then sell the extra fish you catch. With the extra revenue, you can buy a bigger boat. With the extra money the larger boat will bring, you can buy a second one and a third one and so on until you have an entire fleet of trawlers.     ""Instead of selling your fish to a middleman, you can negotiate directly with the processing plants and maybe even open your own plant. You can then leave this little village and move to Mexico City, Los Angeles, or even New York City! From there you can direct your huge enterprise.""     ""How long would that take?"" asked the Mexican.     ""Twenty, perhaps twenty-five years,"" replied the American.     ""And after that?""     ""Afterwards? That's when it gets really interesting,"" answered the American, laughing. ""When your business gets really big, you can start selling stocks and make millions!""     ""Millions? Really? And after that?""     ""After that you'll be able to retire, live in a tiny village near the coast, sleep late, play with your children, catch a few fish, take a siesta, and spend your evenings drinking and enjoying your friends!""     Ordinary Life auditor Wayne Herbert sent me that and it is just a wonderful story about the kinds of things I want us to be about.     I sometimes refer to what wants to happen in here with the phrase ""Journey Into Wholeness."" It is so easy for those of us in the West to think that that journey is out there somewhere, in the outer world. The goal of spiritual work is to become a ""self."" Or, to become aware of the Self. I can't adequately explain to you what this self is. It is the center and, at the same time, the circumference of the personality. It embraces both consciousness and unconsciousness. The Self is known as the Christ in Christianity.     Journey into Wholeness. The root meaning of the word ""holiness"" is this wholeness. Wholeness involves finding the missing parts or the faculties that are lacking in our natures and restoring them to a dignified place in our personality. Usually for those of us in the Western world our need, as reflected in the story of the Mexican fisherman, is relatedness; relatedness to ourselves as well as to others. This is the principle of equality I've spoken to you about so often. We who speak English are limited to one word for ""love."" In Sanskrit there are ninety-six words for love. We are highly specialized in technology yet quite primitive in terms of feelings.     Jesus, and other Eastern spiritual teachers, saw the outer world to be of little importance. The place where the kingdom of God was was inside and among us. For us, however, reality is in the outer, material, physical world. One of the ways this has affected Christian theology is the emphasis on a belief that we are so unique, so distinctive that even our bodies persist on the other side of death. The religion out of which we came, Judaism, thought that after death what happened to us was much like what happens to a dewdrop after the sunrise. Yes, it has individuality while it exists as a separate entity, but it is destined quite quickly to flow back into the great primal ocean of existence and to lose all individuality. Does a drop of water cease to exist when it falls back into the sea? Well, yes and no. Nothing is lost but its individuality is no more. Jesus knew that the ego was a great troublemaker for us.     We cling to everything that we think defines us as individuals. To threaten this notion of who we are is hell. We protect what we call our individuality at all costs. Death is bearable only if we are guaranteed a life after death containing all the characteristics of our individual human life.     You can see how this would affect the way we go about living our lives and making choices about who we are and what are we to do. Those were the questions that shaped, by the way, what became our Bible. After every great cultural upheaval the community of people raised the questions: Who are we and what are we to do?     e.e. cummings once wrote, ""To be yourself in a world that is doing its best to make you everybody else means to fight the hardest battle any human being can fight, and never stop fighting.""     I love the story of the Pentecostal man who wandered into, let us say, a Methodist church. During the sermon, the visitor got so excited that whenever the preacher made a point, the Pentecostal man would scream out, ""Praise God!"" or ""Hallelujah!"" or ""Amen!"" The ushers were so distraught about the Pentecostal's behavior that the head usher went down the aisle and whispered to him: ""You'll have to keep quiet? The pastor's right in the middle of the sermon!"" The Pentecostal man said, ""Keep quiet? How can I keep quiet? I've got the Holy Spirit!"" To which the usher said, ""Well, you didn't get it in this church!""     The Pentecostal man made a theological error that many of us make. You see, he didn't have the Holy Spirit; the Holy Spirit had him! And that's the problem with much of our theology. We wish he had the Holy Spirit. There's a part of us that wishes we could keep the Holy Spirit in the nice, neat, tidy confines of our categories and barriers. We'd like to put God in a box.     Get this: Nobody has the Holy Spirit; the Holy Spirit always has us and, given our Western orientation, that scares us so that we resist and repress and deny until we are spiritual dead as doornails. We want a God in a box like we want everything else in our lives predictable and controllable. We want a religion that is safe. A journey that is predictable. There is no true spiritual journey that is that way.     We modern people have been victimized by own modernity. Of course, we've benefited - we have the sciences, technology, modern medicine, even emphases on human rights come from our modern approach to things. But it has had two deeply destructive effects on our religious and spiritual life.     For one thing it has made people skeptical about spiritual reality. If God can't be proved by modern means, then God must not be.     Second, modernity has led us to be preoccupied with factuality - with scientifically verifiable and historically reliable facts. Modern Western culture is the only culture in human history that has identified truth with factuality. We are, as Marcus Borg calls us, ""fact fundamentalists."" If a statement isn't scientifically or historically factual, it isn't true. These two things are serious mistakes and deadly to the journey inward.     Let me point out that both liberals and conservatives can be fact fundamentalists. Liberals try to rescue a few facts from the fire. Conservatives say the Bible must be factually true in order to be true at all. This is why they emphasize the literal and historical factuality of biblical texts. They both agree - facts are what matters.     If I had a magic wand that worked, one of the things I would do is to get both liberals and conservatives alike to see how modern both of these positions are.     What we've got when it comes to having faith today for most people is whether they can believe ""iffy"" things or not. That, to most people, is what Christianity has become. It is as if what God wants most from us is believing highly problematic statements to be factually true. And, if you can't believe them, then you don't ""have faith"" and probably aren't a Christian.     Listen carefully: Faith has to do with your relation to God, to Self. Not whether you believe the Bible to be true or not.     I'm going to come back to this in the weeks ahead.     Let me see if I can give you an example. One of the questions that has persistently come up in the discussion group has to do with what Jesus' view on violence might be. This has been raised since the events of 9/11. What would Jesus have us do? Does professing to be Christian mean trying to live as Christ might live? And if so, why aren't we doing what he asks us to do?     First of all, I confess I have not a clue what Jesus would do in response to 9/11. My hunch is not much. His interest was not in that sort of thing. Besides, he had little political power.     If we went to him and asked, I think he would probably tell a story. He might tell the story of the Good Iranian Terrorist. That's what the parable of the Good Samaritan sounded like to the people of his time.     ""Who are you he might ask?"" Then tell a story to us as we stand there with our mouths open and scratching our heads.     Maybe he would tell a story like this:     One day a rabbi, in a frenzy of religious passion, rushed in before the ark, fell to his knees, and started beating his breast, crying, ""I'm nobody! I'm nobody!"" The cantor of the synagogue, impressed by this example of spiritual humility, joined the rabbi on his knees. ""I'm nobody!  I'm nobody!"" The custodian, watching from the corner, couldn't restrain himself, either. He joined the other two on his knees, calling out, ""I'm nobody! I'm nobody!"" At which point the rabbi, nudging the cantor with his elbow, pointed at the custodian and said, ""Look who thinks he's nobody!""     I'll tell you something that might be misunderstood. I think that one of the numbers that organized religion has done on us is to convince us that we are supposed to be like Jesus. What God is interested in is saving human beings. That being the case what we must do is be human. The Christian conspiracy, I'm going to call it, against being human is to convince us that what we are supposed to do is be like Jesus.     A couple of years ago there was a popular slogan: WWJD. The goal was to ask before doing any and everything, ""What would Jesus do?""     If Jesus were here today, would he have worked for Enron? Would he have been on the board of directors? If Jesus were here today, would he go to church? Which one? The image that I had of Jesus when I grew up was that Jesus would not go to movies on Sunday but he would go swimming because we had a lot of water in our town. Would he be a Republican or a Democrat? Would he be involved in the political process?     The one thing that Jesus Christ was about was love and he did this by the extravagant way that he lived his life. He wasn't married; he didn't hold down a job; he didn't have to raise kids. The Roman church has it that Jesus was such a guy that not only did he not have a sexual dimension, neither did his mother.     What Jesus was about - and still is - is Love. The extravagant way that Jesus lived his life was to communicate the overwhelming love that God has for us. Boundless love. Inexpressible love. It is like God comes down and puts arms around us and says, ""This is how much I love you. Now love yourself like that."" This was the thing that marked the ministry of Jesus. So Soren Kierkegaard writes, ""To will to be that self which one truly is, is the opposite of despair.""     How do you do that? Well, to be the self you truly are is to have a particular history and it is to aspire to go beyond the limitations of that history and it is to be frustrated when you realize you can't. To accept this humanness means to be passionate about our aspirations and compassionate about our limitations. It is like you get up from where you're sitting and come up here and stand beside me physically and look at the person who is seated in the chair where you are and you have compassion for that person. It is that kind of acceptance.     We are not to be like Jesus. We are to be Christ-like. There is a world of difference.     Jesus went around kicking self-esteem into people. All of the stories that you find in the New Testament are like that. Look at the stories of his ministry. If a man can restore sight to a blind man, he gives that person a new lease on life, a new self-confidence. If a man can absolve a prostitute's guilt in lasting forgiveness, he gives her the gift of self-respect. The crippled, the insane, the leper, the tax collector, the beggar - a motley assortment of humanity desperately in need of self-esteem and he extended it to them.     The same dynamic was at work even when he was chasing the moneychangers out of the temple. It may be temporarily embarrassing to be kicked out of your accustomed place of business, but it has been known to lead to self-respect. The message is: You're made for something better than this. You are loved by God. This self-compassion is foundational for the abundant life and I'm sure that the response Jesus would have us make to the terrorist situation as well as the rest of life is this kind of love.     He would tell a story. One of his central teachings was: You shall know the Truth and the Truth shall set you free. (But first it's going to mess with your life and upset you!) So, let me tell you a story about Truth to ponder. This story is from the Ethiopian culture.     Long ago, Fire, Water, Truth, and Falsehood lived together in one large house. Although all were polite toward each other, they kept their distance. Truth and Falsehood sat on opposite sides of the room. Fire constantly leapt out of Water's path.     One day they went hunting together. They found a large number of cattle and began driving them home to their village. ""Let us share these cattle equally,"" said Truth as they traveled across the grasslands. ""This is the fair way to divine our captives.""     No one disagreed with Truth except Falsehood. Falsehood wanted more than an equal share but kept quiet about it for the moment. As the four hunters traveled back to the Village, Falsehood went secretly to Water and whispered, ""You are more powerful than Fire. Destroy Fire and then there will be more cattle for each of us!""     Water flowed over Fire, bubbling and steaming until Fire was gone. Water meandered along, cheerfully thinking about more cattle for itself.     Falsehood, meanwhile, whispered to Truth. ""Look! See for yourself! Water has killed Fire! Let us leave Water, who has cruelly destroyed our warmhearted friend. We must take the cattle high in the mountains to graze.""     As Truth and Falsehood traveled up the mountain, Water tried to follow. But the mountain was too steep; And Water could not flow upwards. Water washed down upon itself, splashing and swirling around rocks as it tumbled down the slope. Look and see! Water is still tumbling down the mountainside to this day.     Truth and Falsehood arrived at the mountaintop. Falsehood turned to Truth and said in a loud voice, ""I am more powerful than you! You will be my servant. I am your master. All the cattle belong to me!""     Truth rose up and spoke out, ""I will not be your servant!""     They battled and battled. Finally they brought the argument to Wind to decide who was the master.     Wind didn't know. Wind blew all over the world to ask people whether Truth or Falsehood was more powerful. Some people said, ""A single word of Falsehood can completely destroy Truth."" Others insisted, ""Like a small candle in the dark, Truth can change every situation.""     Wind finally returned to the mountain and said, ""I have seen that Falsehood is very powerful. But it can rule only where Truth has stopped struggling to be heard.""     And it has been that way ever since.     I think what Jesus would do if we asked him what we are to do is that he would likely tell a story. And then he would remind us that we ourselves are telling a story with our lives. After saying that, perhaps he would ask, ""Is the story you are telling with your life the truth?""

Kim.   -----Original Message----- From:  Chanley, Earl   Sent: Wednesday, February 06, 2002 5:58 PM To: Watson, Kimberly Subject: RE: Questar San Juan Hub Interconnect  Kim  The in-service date of May 1, will be very difficult to attain. Since the bankruptcy filing, vendors have been very reluctant to ship material prior to it being prepaid (Daniels, Fisher, Rosemont, other). These are the vendors of instrumentation required for the interconnect. Questar may be able to purchase material, but some of the items can have up to a 60 day delivery. (From time PA approved and funded to in-service will be 75 days at most. We have worked with Daniels on a chromatograph on another project and prepayment has taken 45 days alone. Daniels is not set up for prepayments as they bill off an invoice and the main office and accounting had to create an invoice for a chromatograph that had not been delivered. Not the usual mode of operations.  The I/C design is for a UltraSonic meter and this is dependent on their testing schedule ( Canada or Kansas are the only two places to test to 100% of design). Will confirm testing schedule and delivery dates with UltraSonic ASAP.  We will try to complete the I/C with the earliest in-service date possible, but with conditions as they are, a realistic date would be June 15, 2002.

Also, keep Darrell, Market Services and, of course, Randy, plugged into the status.  Thanks, Kim.   -----Original Message----- From:  Lebeau, Randy   Sent: Friday, February 01, 2002 11:26 AM To: Watson, Kimberly Subject: NGPL - Gray Interconnect  I've just been included in some discussion about this interconnect.  Apparently Kinder-Morgan wants to put a control valve downstream of our measurement point.  They want to do this to have some control of deliveries off TW onto their system.  They have some concern about over-deliveries.  I understand that this happened on a couple of occassions in the past (possibly due to a malfunction with our valve).  They assure us that this control valve is only to provide them with the protection against over delivery. It would be set to flow at a rate equal to their nomination, I guess.   As I said, they intend to set this valve downstream of measurement, on their pipe.  Since it will be installed on their pipe, I don't think there's much we can do about it. However, we were wondering if there can be some wording or agreement formalized that says they would not shut this point in before contacting our field personnel and/or gas control.  I don't think this is their intention, but if they did shut in without notification, it would cause problems at our P-3 station. We've tried to talk them out of this installation, but they seem adamant to proceed. I wasn't sure who to contact about this.  Could you let me know if this is a major concern with marketing and scheduling?

We have talked to Richard Riehm in Marketing and he  is looking into the problem but is not sure what's causing these unusual swings.  The Daily Risk report has not been  distributed for the last few days pending resolution of this calculation problem but the correct VaR is still believed  to be over the ETS VaR limit.   We are scheduled to meet with Stan tomorrow, at his request of Vince, to discuss the TW VaR.  I know Tracy  and Vince has had some discussions related to the VaR calculation and that Tracy has discussed TW Marketing's  plans to reduce the VaR.  I'm assuming Tracy will ""facilitate"" the meeting tomorrow and I suggest we use the last   VaR calculation  we believe to be correct for discussion purposes which was as of February 4 data (Total VaR - $1.152mm).   -----Original Message----- From:  Perchal, Cheryl   Sent: Tuesday, February 12, 2002 9:31 AM To: Strohmeyer, Vincent; Cobb Jr., John Subject: Volatility Calculation Importance: High  I think that the problem with the TW VaR is how the volatility is being calculated on the San Juan indices for the months of November 2002 through March 2003.  This is not a Caminus issue, but an issue of how the volatility is being calculated outside Caminus.  It sounded as though Jose will not work on any issue related to Caminus, but I think this issue is outside of Caminus  Comments?","paul.y'barbo@enron.com, lorraine.lindberg@enron.com",kimberly.watson@enron.com,FW: TW Volatility Calculation,2002-02-12 09:39:24-08:00,sent

"Kim,   I wanted to forward you this email that I sent to Vince.  He had come back to Richard and I to resolve an issue with the dropping VaR associated with TW.  Vince was asking if this was related to the processes that we have automated. In speaking with Vernon, the date of the ERMS problem with the San Juan basis discussed below happened to coincide with the date or near proximity of the unwinding the Wholesale positions that TW had held. Consequently, there were substantial changes with the VaR increasing during this period.  When the rolling price data dropped off, it rolls for 30 days, the VaR decreased substantially.  If you have any questions please give me a call.   Sean 713-287-1014      -----Forwarded by Sean Bolks/HOU/Dynegy on 02/12/2002 05:01PM -----  To: vincent.strohmeyer@enron.com From: Sean Bolks/HOU/Dynegy Date: 02/12/2002 04:58PM cc: Richard Riehm/HOU/Dynegy Subject: Issue with San Juan Historic Volatility   Vince,   I left you a message concerning the issue with the VaR.  The problem is associated with the ERMS Price that came on December 19.  The basis was .23 instead of -.23.  This is represented in SJ Price Quote File below. Consequently the inclusion of this date in the rolling 30 day bucket for the Historical Volatility calculation essentially changed the volatility for the entire Winter 2002-2003 strip.  Any I-I deal involving the San Juan was thus flawed and shown in the VaR.     As this did occur on December 19th, this should have been caught in the December time period for any VaR report done on a daily basis since that time.  For example, the San Juan Historical Volatility was .395 on December 17, .394 on December 18, .521 on December 19 and .657 on December 20.  The VaR went up in the same way it came down-- on Feb 4 it was .66, on Feb 5 it was .52, on Feb 6 it was .357 and on Feb 7 it was .343.  This is shown in the attached file San Juan Hist Vol.   As Richard and I do the base calculations, which are correct, we would never catch this mistake.  We are somewhat surprised that when this volatility was included on December 19th the VaR report did not show a substantial increase from the previous day.  In the same way the VaR dropped by half, we would have expected it to double over a period of a couple of days in that week of December.   All in all, this issue took 10 hours for Richard and I to resolve.  As it is essentially out of the perview of setting up the SAS automation process--the process did run correctly, it was a little frustrating for us to devote the time to identifying this particular issue.  It would also appear to be a troubling issue from a financial perspective given the current Enron environment.    I hope this resolves the problem.

Also, keep Darrell, Market Services and, of course, Randy, plugged into the status.  Thanks, Kim.   -----Original Message----- From:  Lebeau, Randy   Sent: Friday, February 01, 2002 11:26 AM To: Watson, Kimberly Subject: NGPL - Gray Interconnect  I've just been included in some discussion about this interconnect.  Apparently Kinder-Morgan wants to put a control valve downstream of our measurement point.  They want to do this to have some control of deliveries off TW onto their system.  They have some concern about over-deliveries.  I understand that this happened on a couple of occassions in the past (possibly due to a malfunction with our valve).  They assure us that this control valve is only to provide them with the protection against over delivery. It would be set to flow at a rate equal to their nomination, I guess.   As I said, they intend to set this valve downstream of measurement, on their pipe.  Since it will be installed on their pipe, I don't think there's much we can do about it. However, we were wondering if there can be some wording or agreement formalized that says they would not shut this point in before contacting our field personnel and/or gas control.  I don't think this is their intention, but if they did shut in without notification, it would cause problems at our P-3 station. We've tried to talk them out of this installation, but they seem adamant to proceed. I wasn't sure who to contact about this.  Could you let me know if this is a major concern with marketing and scheduling?

"FYI.  ILY.  JTW.  >===== Original Message From ordinarylife-owner@yahoogroups.com ===== ORDINARY LIFE - Thoughts and Ideas to Help You Live a Happier Life  ======================================================  Summary of February 17, 2002  ======================================================  Dear Folks ?     When we gathered on Sunday, I spoke with you about the importance and value of great questions in our lives. During this season of Lent I am focusing on themes having to do with the metaphorical movement from -    bondage into freedom,       darkness into light,          Death into life.    We did take an excursion to talk about the importance of managing one's state of mind and I spoke about two ways to do that ? how we manage our bodies and how we manage the focus of our attention.    Then we revisited the Quest for the Holy Grail story because I had had so many questions about it. Indeed, I wasn't able to finish what I had planned to say (we'll wrap that up next week ? along with the telling of another story I learned from Robert Johnson.)    What follows is the full text of the presentation.  Much love,  Bill Kerley  ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++  Quest I On  ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++     When you leave the sessions that we share together here, I want you to leave feeling better than you did when you came in the door. Better about yourself, better about your life, better about your relationships, better about what you do, better about where you live - I'm not talking about the physical place where you live; though that might be involved.     I just love this season of the year. In the liturgical calendar we call it ""Lent."" It is that time from Ash Wednesday to Easter Sunday when we make what I call the journey from bondage to freedom, from darkness into light, from death into life. So much of our spiritual journey can be put under the general theme of a journey, or a quest.     The principles of Ordinary Life are about the beliefs and behaviors we can have that will empower us to have an enhanced experience of life.     How can you get what you really want out of your life on a daily basis? That's the question. Well, it may not be the question but it is an important one.     Question. That's what we are going to talk some about today - questions. The word ""question"" can be written as a sentence: ""Quest I on.""     We are on a quest. We are in fact spending the precious moments of our lives on a quest for something. Is the one you are on what you want? Really?     In order to get what you really want, you have to, what? Know what you want. But even more than that in the belief system we are bringing to our work in here - as reflected by the Ordinary Life principles, wanting just anything and everything misses the point. What do you want?     Most responses to this question are so general and not what we really want anyway. A lot of people last night hoped to win the lottery. People think that having lots of money would bring them happiness. But I would contend that it is not the money that people want. People don't want little pieces of green paper with dead presidents pictures on them. People want what they think they are going to get from those things - freedom, fun, the ability to get with others, to have some kind of pleasure.     I want to put kind of a parenthesis in here before we come back to the heart of the matter.     One of the most important things we can do to create the power, the joy and the passion we really want to live our lives with is to learn to manage our own states of mind. If you don't do this, it will cost you virtually everything you really want in your life - friends, family, success, and joy on a daily basis.     What determines how you feel?     How you feel at any moment in time is purely designed by and the result of how you are directing your own mind and body at that moment. No matter what is happening in your life, you are in control - unless you are in intense physical pain or stressed to the point of exhaustion and mental failure - of your own state. Once you understand this and use it, you have control of your life at a whole new level. You can have more fun, joy, and passion than you ever dreamed of once you take that responsibility and take that control.     Some people resist this notion because it is close to the principle of our having a moral obligation to be happy. It is a heavy responsibility but look at those who never learned to manage their state. Almost every week - sometimes it seems like every day - you read in the paper of people who seem to have had all that would make most happy but didn't learn to manage their state within themselves. There is a major price to pay in not managing your state. For example, a tragic event can happen in one person's life and, after an appropriate time for physical and emotional adjustment, they are able to let the event go and move on in their lives. For other people, they seem to hang on to bitter disappointments forever. It is all a matter of learning to manage your state of mind. In managing it there are major rewards.     How do you do it? There are two primary ways to control your state of mind.    1. Controlling the way you use your physical body.    2. Controlling your mental focus. That is, what you pay attention to, what you think about, what you picture, what you say to yourself when you talk to yourself.     Let's talk about each for a moment.     First, let's see how we can use our physical bodies to create the emotions we want at any moment in time.     In order to feel anything in life, you feel it through your physical body.     Do this exercise: Stand up. Tall. Breathe fully. Look up. Put a huge silly grin on your face. Now, without changing any aspect of your body, get depressed. You can't do it. Changing your body sends a totally different message to your brain. The way we move our facial muscles, the way we gesture, the way we walk, the pace at which we talk - all of these things determine how we feel in any given moment. So when we feel bad, just talking positively to ourselves or making affirmations is not enough.     When most Americans don't like the way they feel, they do something to change their body. Drink, smoke, or eat.     Find some gestures and movements you can make that will instantly change your state. These are your power moves.     How, for example, would you walk if you felt totally successful and unstoppable? Sit the way you would be sitting if you had five times more energy than you ever can remember. Breathe the way you would if you felt strong and excited and energized. Put a facial expression on you would have if you felt totally passionate and excited.     Now go from this state to being in a state of boredom. Sit that way. Bored and tired. What did you change?  Notice.     Though this may sound weird, this is a valuable skill to have. Developing new ways to handle your body is a most valuable way to change states.     Learn how to use your physical body to have enough energy to live with passion and enthusiasm.     A second way to change your state of mind and spirit is to control and direct the focus of your mind. That is, what are you paying attention to right now at this moment? There is tremendous power in controlling the focus of your mind.     We can control what we are focusing on. That is, what we are picturing in our mind, what we are saying to ourselves.     If you go to a party the only things you will have feelings about are the things you focus on. The problem is that you can?t focus on everything. We become deletion creatures. The price we pay for this is to walk around believing that our experience of the world is real.     Some people have, and we'll get into reasons for this in a moment, trained themselves to notice what they don't want and what they don't like. Guess what shows up for them in life? What they don't want! What they don't like!     If you want the party of your life to be one you are happy with and not one you are upset with, you have to focus on what makes you feel great.     The quality of your life is the quality of the state of mind you live in day to day. How you feel day to day determines how you treat yourself, how you treat other people, how great you feel about your life. What determines this is how you use your body and what and how you focus on things. This is how some overcome tragedy and how others don?t.     No matter how good it is, you can always focus on something that isn't perfect or doesn't match your expectations.     Success is creating consistent pleasure in your life and causing yourself to grow. Failure is being able to find pain no matter how good it is.     Understand we are always making decisions about what to focus on. Our hope is in turning off the automatic pilot and taking control. When you do, you instantly change the quality of your life.     In life, we get what we focus on. Whatever you pay attention to is what you experience instantly.     If you feel a certain way on an ongoing basis it is because you ask certain questions on an ongoing basis.     ""Why does this always happen to me?"" The presupposition is that bad things are always happening to you. Do you presuppose things that limit you, that put you down, or that create consistent feelings of success in your life?     The quality of your life is based on the quality of your questions.     Asking, for example, about a horrible situation, what can I learn from this that will enhance my life and the life of others as well? How can I use this situation to help me create more power for me and for others?     If angry at someone you might ask, ""What do I respect about this person?""     Or, ""What is funny about this that I haven't noticed yet?""     When you ask such questions, you have to be willing really to search for the answer. Ask with a sincere interest and desire for an answer.     What could I do today that would be more fun than ever before? To connect more with my loved ones?     Here are some questions I use:     What am I most happy about in my life right now? What about that makes me happy? What else am I happy about?     What am I really excited about in my life right now? What about that makes me excited?     What am I really grateful for in my life right now? You will feel a state change when you answer these questions.     Come up with some questions whose answers can put you in the state you want and read them every morning.     You are already doing this. I'm suggesting that you do it in a way that is useful.     I want to revisit a story I read to you just a few weeks ago. The story is The Quest of the Holy Grail. It is a story rich in meaning and significance. I've had a number of questions seeking clarification.     When the knights of King Arthur's court had seen an apparition of the Grail through a veil, they determined to go on a quest to find it. Remember this is a myth and it is filled with symbolic/metaphorical language. The knight energy within us serves the king. The king energy is that which reflects our sense of integrity and wholeness; our understanding of who we are and what our purpose in this life is. In the story the knights thought, ""We should go out together to find the Grail."" But then they realized that this could be ""a disgrace."" No, each must go alone into the forest and enter at the point he himself would choose, ""where it was darkest and there was no path."" The vision of and the search for the Grail is the quest for meaning and purpose.     Entering the forest alone at the darkest spot, this is the road less traveled. This is the hero?s journey. These times together in Ordinary Life are designed for those ready to take such a journey.     The word hero is related to the words heresy and heretic. All three are derived from a Greek word meaning ""able to choose."" A hero is a chooser. A hero chooses the questions of his or her life and therefore the quest that person chooses to live.     For all of us, the question is the quest-I-on. The questions we ask ? or fail to ask ? shape the journeys of our lives. What distinguishes the person who is experiencing abundant life from the rest is that he or she chooses the questions and earnestly seeks their answers. The rest follow the lead of society.     My question to you is this: will you live your life from the heart, develop a heart of compassion, or live your life conventionally from the prescribed role?     Wisdom asks the right questions.     So much of what is important in life is around questions.     ""Daddy, why is the sky blue?""    ""Who made the world?""    ""What would you do if you won the lottery?""     In the Bible, the questions are so important.     ""Adam, where are you?""    ""Am I my brother's keeper?""    ""Master, what must I do to inherit eternal life?""    ""Who is my neighbor?""    ""Simon, do you love me?""     Wisdom asks the right questions.     Enlightenment is about knowing the person who asks the question.     The more expansive our questions, the wider our consciousness.     King Midas asked for gold. King Solomon asked for wisdom. What are you asking for?     The story of our lives doesn't really get interesting until we know what we want.     Questions ignite your mind like spark plugs ignite the engine of your car.     Is it time to get up?    What shall I wear?    What shall I have for breakfast?    What is on my schedule for today?    Will she make me happy?    Will he be faithful?    What will people think?    How can I pay my bills?     Point? Most of our questions are so automatic we don't even notice them. But they shape our lives. Becoming mindful is becoming aware of the questions you are asking.     What are the dominant questions of your life? They determine your life's direction and shape. So, if you want to change the shape of your life, change your questions.     Our automatic questions lead to one kind of life. Here is another order of questions altogether: ""Who am I? What in the world am I doing here? How can I serve? What is the meaning of my life?"" These questions clearly lead to something else.     In the Grail myth story the hero is the one who is adequate to ""Grail Quest."" His adequacy is not a matter of big muscles or intellectual refinement, but of a simple, childlike heart. Parzival often seems something of a fool. The line between the hero and the fool is always thin.     Parzival is raised by his mother. Even if you were raised by a mechanical monkey, you have a mother. His father was a knight and came to his end in the way knights often do. Mother would see to it that the same thing not happen to her fair-haired boy. She secludes him from knightly things and stories. Of course, this fails. It always does.     One day three knights show up in bright and shining armor and the boy is enchanted. Enchantment is when we fall ""in love"" with someone or something with the belief that if we could just possess it or be possessed by it, then we will ""live happily every after."" Mother then hopes to have him ridiculed out of his questions.     She wants him to give up this foolish business of heroic intentions. Many people do give up their dreams to please mother, or ""mother"" as projected onto their spouses. ""What will people think?"" kind of thing, you know.     So she gives him a pitiful old nag of a horse and a ridiculous costume, one that makes him look exactly like a fool. The tribe never equips us to leave it. We have to find those tools on our own.     Every one on the quest must be prepared to face ridicule. If you want to be sure of yourself, do what society tells you to do. If you want to break out of the conventional mold you must figure out for yourself what you are about.     Some people blithely quote Joseph Campbell's great line that says ""follow your bliss."" This doesn't mean following some silly whim. It means knowing your mission/purpose on this planet and doing whatever is required to fulfill it.  Campbell became a world famous authority on myth because he did what was required, in the face of ridicule and much opposition, to gain that position.     The heart of the story of Parzival and his quest for the Grail is suggested in his first encounter in the Grail castle. After various adventures, Parzival has sort of stumbled into the Grail castle. This is the wisdom of innocence. The purity of the simple fellow gets him into the Grail castle. We must indeed become like children. Gentle as doves. But, we must also be as wise as serpents.     In the castle lives a king who is sorely wounded. The king's illness has brought devastation to the kingdom ? it has become the Wasteland.     All of us, to some degree, get wounded growing up.     In the process of surviving, the child interprets experience in three ways:     The first is in the bonding experiences ? or lack of them ? that we have. The child interprets the tactile and emotional bonding, or lack thereof, as a statement about life in general. Is it predictable and nurturing, or is it uncertain, painful and precarious? This primal perception shapes the child?s ability to trust. All sorts of factors can influence ? death in the family, illness, etc.     Second are the behaviors the child observes growing up. The child internalizes specific behaviors of the parent as a statement about self. So, a parent?s depression, anger or anxiety will be interpreted as a statement about the child. A man asked his dying father, ""Why were we never close?"" The father went into a tirade, ""Do you remember when you were ten and you dropped your toy in the toilet and I had to work to get it out?"" The list of trivial events continued. The son had always thought of himself unworthy. His father set him free by revealing his craziness.     Then there are the beliefs that are handed to the child. The child observes the behaviors of the adults around her or him, their struggles with life, and internalizes not only these behaviors but also the attitudes they imply about the self and the world. Years ago, I would experience an uneasiness when my wife bought new clothes. What I got to in my analysis was a memory of my mother taking me with her to buy new hats when she was depressed. She would try one on and ask me if it looked good enough to get her a compliment. Very inappropriate!     Parzival can redeem the king and the kingdom by asking a simple question.. The wounded king is brought before him, and Parzival wants to ask, ""What ails thee, brother?"" But he has been told good knights don't ask a lot of questions. The decisive moment for him is the choice between acting from his heart or from his role as a knight. He fails; innocence is not enough, for he has already been socially indoctrinated. It has caused him to doubt the promptings of his heart.     He chooses to act the way he thought he was supposed to. He muffed his opportunity for the Grail because he was trying so hard to be a good boy. He goes to bed that night, and when he gets up in the morning, the castle is empty. As he leaves the castle, he hears a voice shouting, ""You silly goose.. Why didn't you open your mouth and ask the lord the Question?"" One of the experiences of mid-life is to ""wake up"" and discover that the castle is empty. What we do then is critically important.     Though a little dense, he soon enough comes to realize that he has missed his chance. He is really depressed. He could see now that his being so slow to ask the question as he sat beside the sorrowing king has cost him.     So, for the next five long years he tries desperately to find his way back to the castle. He is booed and jeered. Everyone knows he has failed and everywhere is the desolation of the Wasteland.     But he is gaining the wisdom of experience, of commitment, loyalty, and dedication. His journey weaves through a maze-like set of experiences through which he comes to redeem and understand his past. Holding to his quest, his question, provides him with the ball of string that he can unwind and find his way out of the wasteland and back to the Grail castle. You may well want to find a spiritual teacher or therapist to help you understand and know the one who is asking the question. But don't look to that person to provide the question for you. All the answers you need about your life you already have within you.     Of course, he eventually triumphs and, in fact, becomes himself the Grail King. Through his tenacity of purpose, or loyalty to the Quest, he makes it..     Just so, all who take up the great Quest-i-ons of life and hold tenaciously to them will enter into a marvelous life, the life of their destiny.     For Parzival, and I think for you and me, too; the basic issue is compassion. In other words, ""What ails thee, brother? What ails thee, sister?"" Jesus talked about tending to needs of the least of these, his brothers and sisters.     If around you it looks like a wasteland, the way out is through the heart. If the heart is not the center of your life, you are not really living; you are inauthentic. This is what the Grail story, and Jesus, and others, tell us.     Whatever is at the center of your life will be the source of security, guidance, wisdom and power.     When next we gather, I'll make some remarks about the rest of the Grail story and what the words ""security,"" ""guidance,"" ""wisdom"" and ""power"" mean.     The loving heart, the heart of compassion is the reality of human life. The desire to be what you are is what begins to wake you up.     No matter where you go this week, no matter what happens, remember this: You are carrying precious cargo. Watch your step.  ======================================================  Ordinary Life is a gathering that provides an opportunity to develop an enlightened heart and an awakened mind to the reality of the present moment..

Kim.   -----Original Message----- From:  Brown, Elizabeth   Sent: Tuesday, February 19, 2002 12:39 PM To: Buchanan, John; Watson, Kimberly Subject: Discounting of GRI on One-part Contracts Importance: High  It again appears that some one-part contracts have not had the GRI commodity portion discounted to zero whenever possible.  This detail needs to be reviewed monthly since it  impacts Transwestern's bottom line.  Can we discuss so that everyone is on the same page?  Maybe we need a point person in the scheduling group to review a monthly report and identify who within Marketing will be updating/correcting the rates in CBS.  Examples of discounted contracts in January 2002 where we paid out to the GRI rather than discounting to zero and taking the money to income: Sempra K #27808 PG&E Energy Trading K #27796 Western Gas K #27797 Agave K #27377 Tenaska K #27792   Please let me know what your thoughts are.

Also,  I know Socal confirms the Needles point via EDI. Will they also confirm this Socal Topock point via EDI? If they do confirm via EDI, it would be good to have them work with Mary Draemer on a test EDI file. Will they give us a window like they do at Socal needles?  Today in TMS, we do have a Non Grid cycle that runs just prior to the gas day starting at 7:30 am. I know Socal does not confirm  this cycle today for Needles. Also, currently in production today Socal Needles point 10487 is set up as a passive point for confirmation. This Topock point would need to be set up with the same point status role for confirmation if they confirm this point via EDI. Socal will need to complete the Operator Choice request form that is posted on the TW web site.

"Oh, My Italian Amigos,  I just received a fax from Hotel Condotti and they do have availability for June 7 & 8 at a rate of Euro 233 ( which is about USD $204) which includes breakfast and taxes.   http://hotelcondotti.com/rooms.html  http://www.hotelfirenzeroma.it/ing/hotel.htm  Please check out each of the above web sites and let me know what you think.  The Condotti is a little more expensive, but certainly looks very nice.  We know that Firenze was fine and I'm certainly happy to stay there again if everyone is game.    John, do you have a preference?  Paul please talk with Judy and let me know what your vote is.   Also, let me know if you want me to check on other hotels in Rome.  Once I tally the votes, I'll confirm the hotel.   Thanks, Kim.    P.S.  Paul, you'll have to give me your credit card information.  Call me with this info, do not send email.

"FYI.  ILY.  SYT.  JTW.  >===== Original Message From ordinarylife-owner@yahoogroups.com ===== ORDINARY LIFE - Thoughts and Ideas To Help You Live a Happier Life  ====================================================== PREVIEW for March 10, 2002 ======================================================  Dear Folks -     A tradition in our marriage is taking some time off and away when one of us has a birthday. Sherry's is coming up and we're going to go celebrate. I've asked one of the most popular guest speakers to return to spend time with you.     Marsha Davis-Riley has spoken often to Ordinary Life and always with good response. This Sunday the title of his presentation is:                         ""Homecoming""     This is what she has to say about her topic:     ""No matter how high the stakes, it is tempting to remain in a limited life role, languishing in its safety, borne of  familiar patterns and rituals. The freedom to improvise rarely occurs to us. It just happens one day on our way home.""     I'm not sure exactly how she will amplify on that but it sounds very compatible with what we've been talking about. Certainly it sounds as if it fits ""Journey into Wholeness.""     I'll see you on the 17th to talk about SIN.  Much love,  Bill Kerley  PS ? Up for bringing refreshments this week are: Jim and Jeanne Smith & Denise Salet ======================================================  Ordinary Life is a gathering that provides an opportunity to develop an enlightened heart and an awakened mind to the reality of the present moment..  The gathering meets on Sunday mornings at 9:45 am in Fondren Hall at St. Paul's UMC - 5501 South Main, Houston, Texas and is taught by Dr. Bill Kerley.

"My Italian Amigos,  I have just received a fax from the Marincanto Hotel, Positano.  They do have availability for us beginning May 25 for 3 nights.  They have at least one standard double room (sea view) for Euro 186 (approximately $165 USD) and one superior double room (also sea view) for Euro 217 ( approximately $192 USD).  The only difference between the rooms that I can tell from their fax is that the superior room has a jacuzzi bath.  I do not know where in the room the jacuzzi is located.  This hotel has a private beach (I think I read somewhere in one of my books that there was a small nominal fee to use the beach) with a private descent (Wahoo!).  They also have private parking at the cheap price of Euro 18 per day and only a thousand (uphill each way) steps to it.    Is this hotel still OK?  I do not know if they have two standard room and two superior rooms or just one of each type available.  Please let me know what your preference is.  I can clarify in my next fax.  If both our preferences are for the same type room and they only have one of each, shall we draw straws or have a pizza eating contest?  Also, there was one other hotel in Positano that I looked into before finding Hotel Marincanto for our Sept. trip but they were full.  I may look them up tonight and fax them tomorrow just to compare.  Please advise.  Thanks, Kim.    P.S.  We also have a fax from Hotel Firenze in Rome that we are confirmed for June 7 & 8!

Summary 1) Before pigging, (i.e. 21-27th), the efficiency was about 96.5% 2) After the pig run on the 27th, the efficiency increased to about 102% for two days. 3) It averaged about 101% for the next 6 days (i.e. 28th-5th March).   4) It then steadily plummeted to 98% over a 3-day period - a percent degradation a day! (5th-8th March) 5) It remains around the 98% average today.  Essentially, the high efficiency resulting from the 27th Feb pigging lasted just about a week. The targeted efficiency for this section is 103%.  At the TW commercial meeting this afternoon, we indicated that applying the DRA around the end of May (together with other planned outages) may be the way to go.

With that, there is one change that will impact the Commercial group.  In the old CBS system, the Contract Admin group was responsible for identifying whether a contract was negotiated as a one-part or two-part rate.  Until a deal sheet is built and the new rates/revenue system is implemented, the Marketers will continue to update discounts in the existing CBS system under Negotiated Rates Maintenance.    Additionally, the Marketer will be responsible for updating within the same rate maintenance screen the one-part/two-part flag for all new firm contracts under the 'reservation' charge code.  If a contract amendment requires a change to this indicator, this must also be captured; however, be advised that this field does not have effective dates.  Therefore, if the indicator is not applicable until a future date, the one-part/two-part flag cannot be updated because the current billing will pick up this change.  I will provide any additional training if necessary regarding the loading of rates/indicators.  If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me.  As a reminder, we have scheduled internal demos of the new system today at 1:30pm and 3pm as well as this Thursday at 1:30pm in EB3907.

Baking Time: 40 min. Preparation Time: 5 min. Comments: This a really simple appetizer to make. If you haven't had roasted garlic before, you'll be amazed how roasting makes the pungent garlic into a buttery, mellow spread. I like it best spread on fresh bread with goat cheese on top. Its also a great butter and mayonnaise substitute for sandwiches, that's low in calories. (Ignore the 83% fat percentage in the nutritional information below, its counting all of the olive oil, most of which slips off) The whole head of garlic has only 24 calories!!  Ingredients: 1 head garlic 1/2 teaspoon olive oil Instructions: Preheat oven to 450 degrees F.  Chop top 1/5 of garlic head (from the pointy tip).  Discard any extra garlic skin, leaving most of it intact.  Place garlic head in a medium sized piece of aluminum foil.  Pour olive oil on top of garlic.  Wrap foil around garlic, encompassing the entire head.  Bake in oven until the garlic is golden brown and the garlic pulp is easily removed from its individual shell (around 40 minutes).  Remove from oven; let cool.  plus  Baked Pears on Sugared Puff Pastry with Caramel Sauce http://www.epicurious.com/run/recipe/view?id=10012  ================================================= Jim & Hattie Haricots Verts a La Vapeur http://www.epicurious.com/run/recipe/view?id=11972  plus Red Pepper Soup (to be faxed by Kim to 409-938-3710) plus two bottles of red wine (French, of course)  ================================================ Tom & Jerilynn - our hosts for the evening  pate (purchased), cocktail party toast 2 selections of French cheese crackers 2 bottles of white wine (French)  ===============================================  Kim & John Duck with Orange Sauce 2 bottles of red wine (French)  ===============================================  Sam Cook - is not sure whether she can attend, so her assignment is pending.  ===============================================  We look forward to seeing you all there!

"Hattie,   This recipe is from my Paris cooking class.  It is supposed to be wonderful served chilled (when we cooked it in class, we served it warm).  Be careful not to add too much cream since chilling it makes it a little thicker anyway.  Also, after you puree it in the blender, Marie Blanche (our cooking teacher) recommends that you strain all of the chunks out with cheese cloth. She says the reason for this is so that the guests will have a harder time figuring out all of the ingredients.  It is part of the Parisian mystery of cooking.   Good Luck!

"FYI, Kim.   -----Original Message----- From:  Frazier, Perry   Sent: Thursday, March 07, 2002 2:25 PM To: Lebeau, Randy; Watson, Kimberly; Abdmoulaie, Mansoor Subject: RE: Re Ivanhoe E.S.D  Just a couple of additional thoughts,  the cost estimate for ESD mods of $130,000 will typically be, about 25% more.  The E&C costs,  company overheads and construction support will increase these costs to around $170,000.  I did talk with Fred this morning and will relay the highlights of our conversation.    The current free flow rates north on this lateral average around 35 - 50 mmcfd.  The gas supply is from the Leedy Plant and various low pressure gathering interconnects.  The gas flows north bypassing the compression unit but utilizing the dehydration unit at Ivanhoe.  The gas end up with NNG on the North side of the lateral,  this Lipscomb lateral is isolated from the TW system at the Canadian River block valve.  The 2 units at Ivanhoe are idle and were designed for higher pressure delivery to NNG.  Since they have not run in some time, its probable to spend an additional $300,000 to activate and upgrade the control panels and end devices.  Then we would most likely have to design and resize the units for an additional guess of $350,000.  In order to abandon these units, I would recommend we abandon in place or Plant Held For Future Use.  My guess is about $15 - 25,000 to pull spool pieces and blind flange the units.  I do know that there is some drilling going on in the area,  I don't see a tremendous influx of supply to support the cost to utilize this lateral any different than the current status.

Since the bankruptcy filing, vendors have been very reluctant to ship material prior to it being prepaid (Daniels, Fisher, Rosemont, other). These are the vendors of instrumentation required for the interconnect. Questar may be able to purchase material, but some of the items can have up to a 60 day delivery. (From time PA approved and funded to in-service will be 75 days at most. We have worked with Daniels on a chromatograph on another project and prepayment has taken 45 days alone. Daniels is not set up for prepayments as they bill off an invoice and the main office and accounting had to create an invoice for a chromatograph that had not been delivered. Not the usual mode of operations.  The I/C design is for a UltraSonic meter and this is dependent on their testing schedule ( Canada or Kansas are the only two places to test to 100% of design). Will confirm testing schedule and delivery dates with UltraSonic ASAP.  We will try to complete the I/C with the earliest in-service date possible, but with conditions as they are, a realistic date would be June 15, 2002.

I wanted you all to have a look at what we believe is the final draft.  It is a fairly standard, fully reimbursable interconnect with Questar.  Transwestern will own and operate the interconnect.  You will notice that Questar has requested a ""Payment Plan"" that details when they will pay Transwestern for the interconnect due to the recent Enron events.  If anyone has any questions or concerns about the timing of these payments, please give me a call.  Also, you will notice this interconnect may not be subject to the CIAC tax gross up, but to protect ourselves, we have added language in Para 3.2 that protects us financially if the IRS ever comes back to determine that this interconnect is subject to the CIAC tax.   Robert Guthrie with the tax department has worked with us to develop this language.    We hope to execute this Agreement this week.  If you have any comments, please let me know.
