"Will we ask for approval of the sale?  If so will we ask             From:  Gary Zahn                           11/27/2000 02:22 PM    To: Rod Hayslett/FGT/Enron@ENRON cc: Bob Chandler/ET&S/Enron@ENRON, James Saunders/FGT/Enron@Enron   Subject: Re: Asset Divestiture Approval    Rod,  to my knowledge the Commission has not specifically defined what is de  minimus.   The working definition of an Operating Unit or System is taken  from an Office of the Chief Accountant Interpretative Letter issued  May 26,  1961.  ""The principal tests are amount of investment, character of the  property acquired, and continuity of operation.  The following have been  deemed to be operating units or systems: a large compressor station, a  processing plant, an important measuring station, a gathering system or  important segment thereof,  a transmission line or important segment.  If the  transaction involves such a small amount of property as to be de minimus, it  need not be considered as an operating unit.""  If a customer is attached to  the facilities to be sold it is considered prima facie evidence that the  property is an operating unit or system.  In a July 8, 1992, the NNG Rate department in an interoffice memorandum  regarding the Definition of an Operating Units or System noted ""The  Commission has not specifically defined de minimus, however, based on past  rulings we can assume that the investment must be something less than $9  million, or a pipeline less than 7.586 miles.""  The 1.091 miles of 6"" pipe and Faribault TBS #1 and the Northfield 4""  branchlines of 4.9 miles and TBS have a net book value of $57,712.   My main concern, if we use the de minimus rationale, are we not setting a  precedent in which future sales or acquisitions will have to be viewed?  Some  of those future de minimus sales could involve gains!   Again, it is not clear how the Commission will make its determination.  The  downside, if the Commission rejects our argument, NNG will have a $ 58K loss  on the sale of these assets.

Please indicate your approval or rejection of this proposal on the approval  form and return to either James Centilli (EB4250) or David Waymire (OMA0755)  by 5PM Monday, November 27th.  If you have questions or concerns, please  contact James Centilli (853-5028) or myself (398-7062).  These branchlines are experiencing heavy encroachment.  The Faribault  branchline is currently being odorized by NSP per a previous arrangement in  order to comply with a commitment NNG made to the DOT to transport odorized  gas because of the population density along the pipeline.    There is no threat of a by pass by selling these branchlines.  There is an  estimated annual O&M savings of $10k to $20k plus the avoided expense,  exposure and operational headaches of not having to monitor high pressure  branchline odorization.  The net book value of these facilities is $57,712.  The facilities will be  sold for $1.  In addition, NSP has agreed to enter into a 1 year  transportation agreement guaranteeing incremental revenues of $350,000.    The net book value of the facilities, is assumed to be of such small value as  to be de minimus as allowed by previous rulings of the Commission and  will  be treated as a non-operating unit.  This will allow the undepreciated  balance to be cleared to depreciation reserves.  The sale will require that the Northfield TBS be relocated upstream of the  main line take off at an estimated cost of $225,000.

"Based on the attached, NBP is extremely cheap!  While the level of required  premium over the current market price to buy back the shares is difficult to  determine, I wonder why we wouldn't take a hard look at buying Duke's units  (at no premium).  I see basically two paths:  First, a strategic investment  made in contemplation of buying the remainder of the NBP units back  (presumably at a premium over current prices)  and then contributing the NBP  investment into the new regulated entity structure (at higher values).    Second, at these prices the investment in NBP units compares favorably to  other acquisitions GPG is looking at, e.g. East Tennessee.  Even if the  contribution to the new entity doesn't occur, GPG could hold the Duke units  for an indefinite time period, report reasonably good incremental earnings  and cash flow and sell them back to the public at an opportunistic level.

"Rod, per our discussion recently, I've drafted up some language to be  included in ETS approval authority guidelines in the event that projects  overrun their initially approved amounts:  Once capital projects are approved (whether included in the Plan or not),  spending is limited to the approved level. If a project is projected to  overrun, proper approval authority must be obtained prior to expending or  committing to anything over the approved amount. In no case, can anything be  spent over the approved amount without obtaining additional approval.  To determine the appropriate approval level needed, add the expected overrun  to the originally approved amount. Then go to the appropriate section (ie  projects not approved in the Plan or projects approved in the Plan) and  identify the appropriate approval level for the new total. For example, if a  capital project was approved in the Plan for $1.8MM and it is projected to  overrun by $.2MM, the ETS President can approve the overrun. However, if the  original amount were $1.9MM in the Plan and is expected to overrun by $.2MM,  the ETS President cannot approve. It must go to the GPG CEO. Further, if the  project's new total exceeds the GPG CEO authority, the decision will be made  at that level when and how to obtain approval from Enron's Office of the  Chairman.

Northern does have a fuel tracker, however, and might  avoid adverse earnings impact from tax volatility if we could pay those taxes  in kind and stick them in the tracker.  We probably couldn't do that until  the next rate case, however, because all current taxes are built into our  base rates at some representative level.

"Rod,  I spoke with Colin Skellett (CEO of Wessex and AZX's vice chairman) and Keith  Harris (Wessex's CFO) late this morning.  Here are some thoughts coming out  of this conversation:  Wessex is launching the ""heads of terms"" (Britspeak for detailed bullet-point  term sheet) with their lawyers, who have the Kelda announcements and  experience on having done this in the electric industry in the UK. Colin and Keith's view is that you will be extremely helpful in looking at  how this works in practice and being sure the commercial overview points (not  necessarily water industry points) are being addressed, from the perspective  of both the service and the asset companies though obviously principally from  the service company viewpoint. The broad schedule is to meet with the lawyers Monday July 10 in London to go  over the format, after you've had some time to acquaint yourself with what  you need to understand about Wessex or the UK water industry.  (Keith is  confirming that date with the lawyers but believes it will work.) After that meeting, the term sheet will be refined on an iterative basis,  probably going to full contract draft without numbers in, so that all issues  are on the table in advance of the AZX board meeting, which is set for Monday  Aug 7.  (Note that we will probably do the asset/service separation  regardless of whether we decide to monetize the asset piece in some form.)  We've set up a conference call, subject to your schedule, for 10:30am Houston  time tomorrow (Wednesday June 28) to go over this game plan.  From there,  given the US holiday and other items, it's sounding like this will work well  with the timetable you and I discussed yesterday.  In particular:  You could fly over to the UK Wednesday night July 5, arriving Thursday, and  spend perhaps Thursday pm and all day Friday with Wessex personnel learning  more about their business.  (They have a fairly standard tour of customer  center, laboratories, and water and wastewater treatment plants that could be  organized and I think would give you a good overview of their facilities.) On Monday we could meet in London. You could fly back to the US Tuesday the 11th, making your meeting on  Wednesday the 12th as planned. You would have ongoing involvement, perhaps involving a further trip to the  UK, before the AZX board meeting in August, and thereafter.   Unfortunately, that leaves you with a weekend in the UK.  You'd have to  endure a tour of the Roman baths (very fascinating), a weekend in the  Cotswolds (30 minutes from Bath and Bristol), or go to London early  (theaters, shopping).  What we all do for Enron.    Please let me know if 10:30 Wednesday works for a conference call so that I  can let the folks there know.  The UK is 6 hours ahead of the US, so if we  need to push back later we can still do so, though it's getting into their  evening if we go much past noon our time.  Sorry for the long message--I'm in a meeting late afternoon today and may not  be available if you call.",rod.hayslett@enron.com,john.ale@enron.com,Re: Wessex,2000-06-27 05:27:00-07:00,received

Was your proposal something you've seen elsewhere  -- if     so, please can you let us see the contract.?      In the latest proposal  Engco take all the pain/gain for X % around the  target,     and  the pain/gain sharing happens above/below  X % of the target.   This  is at     odds with  what normally happens -- usually the client  would work up a  target     cost with the contractor, & then there would be a pain/gain share split  from     that target onwards. Sometimes there is a cap to the risk carried by one  of the     parties.      The problem with the proposal below is that AssetCo is setting the cost ,  and I     assume the scope  & programme.   And then asking Engco to take the risk  that     AssetCo's estimate is realistic.   We would end up with endless arguments     between the parties as to the details of the scope -- because that is  the  way     that Engco  would make its money.    How would AssetCo be incentivised to  be     accurate in the estimating  , if errors to X % are picked up by Engco.      I am assuming of course that you would be setting the estimates at the 13%     saving assumed in the Internal Business Plan, which we all acknowledge is  going     to be hard to achieve.      I think we need quite a bit of work on this area --  I suggest we set up a     sub-group to work through the details of how the Engco payment terms  would work,     for the Contracting Risk option.

"Rod,  Rebecca and I (along with John Garrison) actually were discussing the Wessex  situation and your important contribution Wednesday.  We really appreciate  the effort, and hope to keep you involved as and when this goes forward.  Earlier this week Sir Ian Byatt announced he would not approve the Kelda deal  in its current structure.  His complaints were principally about  mutualization, though he had some reservations about how they would address  independence in the asset/operations separation--mostly related to keeping  the responsibility on AssetCo for drinking water and environmental quality.   Merrill Lynch thinks this will push the process back a few months, as Kelda  redraws and the new regulator (a life-long bureaucrat) cautiously moves into  his new role.    I suspect we will try to reorganize the business more formally along these  lines, but may be holding off on detailed work on the contracts for a  while--assuming our board would prefer us to be the second company to go  through this, not the test case.  We'll know more after the dust settles on  the recent Ofwat announcement and our board meeting on August 7.  As for expenses, I leave that to Michael, but I imagine it would be easier if  you processed the info and sent a single bill to AZX.  Thanks.

Specifically, answers to the following questions  would be helpful:  Does the candidate possess the required technical skills to be successful in  this job?     No question in my mind. Does the candidate possess the necessary leadership and teamwork skills and  behaviors?    Appears to have the necessary skills and behaviors, got along  great and would argue that he is probably a step up from Nick Bednorz. Does the candidate possess the necessary communication skills (internal &  external)?     Extremely good discussion on some technical accounting issues  convinced me he could articulate succinctly rather complex accounting in  simpler terms.    Believable and gave me a feeling he could be trusted.  Does the candidate seem in alignment with Enron's values?     Saw nothing  that would indicate otherwise. In your opinion, do you believe the candidate would be successful in this  job?     Better bet than most, I would say.  Any other feedback would be most appreciated!

"Dear Rod, I want to thank you for meeting with the UH team last week.  I am looking forward to a continued relationship with you and your colleagues at Enron.  I understand that both the undergraduate student and the MS in finance student that I referred to you were happy to have received inquiries from Enron.  A team of faculty in Finance has proposed development of an energy oriented undergraduate curriculum in which students would take a program of study leading to a specialization in energy.  We are developing a curriculum that will cut across several units of the University as well as departments within the Bauer College so that our students can take courses like Petroleum and gas geology, Energy products and their production, Energy history, The global energy map, discoveries, exploration etc.  This will lead to a first-rate, full-time program for undergraduate students who will earn a bba in Energy Finance or Energy Business.  The next step in our proposal is to create a five year undergraduate/graduate course of study.  We contemplate that students in the above mentioned Energy Finance/Business program will be able to apply for a continuation of their study for a graduate degree. They will apply for an advanced degree in the first semester of their senior year. If accepted, they will begin taking our specially designed Energy Finance graduate courses in the last semester of their senior year. These courses will also apply toward the completion of their undergraduate degree. Moreover, these students will then continue on for one more year of graduate course work, by the end of which they will obtain an MS in Energy Finance degree.  We are currently in the formative stages of developing the curriculum for this program.  To be successful, this program needs to develop with participation of individuals within the energy sector.  We would love to have some feedback from you and others in the industry regarding what they see as the desirable set of tools and skills  that they would like graduates of this program to have.  I was wondering if the Finance Faculty's development team for this initiative could meet with you to discuss the curriculum and illicit your view regarding how this program should develop.  Thank you again for your help.  I am looking forward to hearing from you soon.  Best, Ron  Ronald F. Singer Professor and Chair Department of Finance C.T.

She has blazed the trail for others to  follow and transition into a higher level of employee.   Her work is helping  us in attempting to identify and correct more measurement data as it comes in  from the Field RTUs.

I also plan on attending Phil's staff meeting on November  13th - half day - afternoon.  Are there any key points that you want covered in a weekly report?   When do  you want the report in hand?  I plan to start meeting with Phil and all his direct reports (one on one) to  determine their needs from our organization, as soon as the announcement  comes out.  I will work with our organization to develop objectives for 2001  based off these interviews.  Do you have any concerns if I go ahead and get with Human Resources and get a  posting for an Administrative Assistant for myself?    John Keller had a three day meeting offsite scheduled for next week in the  Woodlands, that George Quittner and I are scheduled to be a part of.   I plan  on missing the second day due to the meeting with CES on Thursday.  Are there any other pressing issues that I need to be involved with next  week?   I understand that the EOTT budgets are due to the Administrative  Directors on November 7th and to Tracey on the 10th.   When will the budgets  be presented to EOTT?   I met with Jerry Martin several times this week.   We also meet with George  Wasaff and Derryl Cleaveland in the GSS organization a couple of times.   We  decided it would be best for all of Enron, as well as for ETS to have Four  (4) of the recommended six (6) EE&CC Procurement personnel to go into the GSS  organization rather than the ETS procurement department.    We have moved  Jerry Thomas, Dwain Moody, Rick Perkins and Sue Perkins to the GSS  organization.  George Wasaff and Jerry Martin have agreed that Jerry Thomas  will continue to manage the procurement of materials for Florida's Phase IV  and Phase V projects, while lending his knowledge of compression to all of  Enron.   We will use our procurement personnel to execute the material  requirements.  Therefore we are only bringing two (2) people into the ETS organization -  Mary Lynne Dix and Josh Mayes.    Jim Davis and Jerry Thomas have expressed  real concerns to Jerry, George and myself about these decisions.   If we  continue to manage projects in the traditional EE&CC manner, their concerns  are valid.   But we feel if we partner with the GSS organization and properly  use third parties for the peaks, we can manage these projects efficiently.    We will continue to monitor the Phase IV, Phase V and NBPL expansion project  closely to assure no loss of productivity during this transition.  John Keller, yourself and I met with George Quittner this week.   George and  I are reviewing our organization and working on how to manage the  organization most effectively for ETS Operations.    We discussed  possibilities this week and it is quite obvious that we have different  opinions on where we should be going with this. We will meet next week to finalize a proposal.   More to come.  Do you have a good feel for what my job title should reflect on my business  cards?    Should I just hold off?  Thanks again for your vote of confidence and the job offer.   I look forward  to serving this organization in this capacity.   I look forward to our new  working relationship.

It probably would have been more  appropriate to treat both the increase and deferral as non-recurring.  We  will change the historical file to reflect that methodology.  This will  decrease the 1999 recurring Direct O&M by $3.5MM on NNG and $.4MM on TW.  The  attached file reflects the changes.  This does not have any effect on total  O&M or IBIT, only the split between recurring and non-recurring.   ---------------------- Forwarded by Elaine Concklin/ET&S/Enron on 11/06/2000  11:14 AM ---------------------------  11/01/2000 04:39 PM Vera Apodaca Vera Apodaca Vera Apodaca 11/01/2000 04:39 PM 11/01/2000 04:39 PM To: Harry Walters/ET&S/Enron@ENRON cc: Elaine Concklin/ET&S/Enron   Subject: O&M Variance - 1998 to 2000   Harry,  here is the explanation.

"We will have to do project economics by pipeline as well as in total.    A  way to allocate costs however is to do so according to the benefits  received.      That way no one can argue that they didn't get the same  deal.    If the deal makes sense from a group standpoint, then it should make  sense from an individual pipeline standpoint.  Project economics need to be looked at in 2 ways.     1) The project  economics on a stand alone basis and then 2) the more accurate approach of  what does the project do to the entity (the with and without approach).

Additional  ""discretionay"" items to consider are overheads, perhaps AFUDC,  and perhaps indirect allocations (ie corporate allocations).   There is more than capital and o&m to consider when developing a  comprehensive project economic analysis or accounting recap.  From an economic standpoint its critically important to identify all of the  cash flows and their timing, both ""in"" (savings) and ""out"", and not worry  about accounting. From an accounting standpoint; and if an ORR is necessary  its important to identify the accounting flow of a project which will always vary from the cash flow.

I would suggest you run these by Jim Saunders (to check on  what should be capitalized and what shouldn't) and by Denis Tu (to see if he  has run across any other things you might have left out in his experience).  As to the question ""How will we account for the additional O&M budget dollars  which could start hitting the O&M budget in the same year the project is  completed?"" that's pretty easy, they aren't authorized to be spent.    If the  dollars for the support of projects aren't budgeted or specifically  authorized in the project funding document, then something must be cut to  allow for the dollars to be spent, or we will have to request additional  funding to carry out the program.    When we do that, unless we are beating  budget somewhere else, it would appear that we would not meet our goal and  therefore the bonus pool of dollars would be reduced directly as a result of  the additional costs.    (Bonus pool = about 2.5% of net income.)    This is  why it's so important to get the numbers right as soon as is practical.

Once a project is  completed it is easy to account for the additional O&M dollars in future  budgets.  Please let me know ASAP if I am on the right track with this.

"Rod,  Legal is reviewing the contract at this time and hopes to finish next week.   Yesterday I was notified that the guaranteed revenues from the transportation  agreement may be raised by $5,000 to $10,000 due to revised sizing  requirements of  the TBS as requested by NSP.    We have had several meetings with operations to ensure that the facilities  that are included in the sale are correct.  Also, the O&M savings are the  estimates given by the field.  Based on average costs for similar facilities  the expected O&M savings would be between $6K and $8k. The field has  indicated however because of the encroachment that they receive a large  number of line locate requests each year for these branchlines which drives  up the O&M costs.  My expectations are that we would save closer to $10k in  O&M costs rather than the $20k.  In addition, regulatory reminded me today that there is still a farm tap  issue that has to be cleared up before the sale.  All farm taps receiving  service from these branchlines must be disconnected and service provided by  another utility prior to the sale.  The latest estimate that I received was  that this would be completed by the end of the year.

"Rod,  to my knowledge the Commission has not specifically defined what is de  minimus.   The working definition of an Operating Unit or System is taken  from an Office of the Chief Accountant Interpretative Letter issued  May 26,  1961.  ""The principal tests are amount of investment, character of the  property acquired, and continuity of operation.  The following have been  deemed to be operating units or systems: a large compressor station, a  processing plant, an important measuring station, a gathering system or  important segment thereof,  a transmission line or important segment.  If the  transaction involves such a small amount of property as to be de minimus, it  need not be considered as an operating unit.""  If a customer is attached to  the facilities to be sold it is considered prima facie evidence that the  property is an operating unit or system.  In a July 8, 1992, the NNG Rate department in an interoffice memorandum  regarding the Definition of an Operating Units or System noted ""The  Commission has not specifically defined de minimus, however, based on past  rulings we can assume that the investment must be something less than $9  million, or a pipeline less than 7.586 miles.""  The 1.091 miles of 6"" pipe and Faribault TBS #1 and the Northfield 4""  branchlines of 4.9 miles and TBS have a net book value of $57,712.   My main concern, if we use the de minimus rationale, are we not setting a  precedent in which future sales or acquisitions will have to be viewed?  Some  of those future de minimus sales could involve gains!   Again, it is not clear how the Commission will make its determination.  The  downside, if the Commission rejects our argument, NNG will have a $ 58K loss  on the sale of these assets.

If you have questions or concerns, please  contact James Centilli (853-5028) or myself (398-7062).  These branchlines are experiencing heavy encroachment.  The Faribault  branchline is currently being odorized by NSP per a previous arrangement in  order to comply with a commitment NNG made to the DOT to transport odorized  gas because of the population density along the pipeline.    There is no threat of a by pass by selling these branchlines.  There is an  estimated annual O&M savings of $10k to $20k plus the avoided expense,  exposure and operational headaches of not having to monitor high pressure  branchline odorization.  The net book value of these facilities is $57,712.  The facilities will be  sold for $1.  In addition, NSP has agreed to enter into a 1 year  transportation agreement guaranteeing incremental revenues of $350,000.    The net book value of the facilities, is assumed to be of such small value as  to be de minimus as allowed by previous rulings of the Commission and  will  be treated as a non-operating unit.  This will allow the undepreciated  balance to be cleared to depreciation reserves.  The sale will require that the Northfield TBS be relocated upstream of the  main line take off at an estimated cost of $225,000.

We have developed a good  structure for the transaction being considered a sale and we have developed  the necessary contract documents to accomplish the deal but at present we  have no takers.     7. No comments.     8. I think this was intended to be the MOPS sale which I believe has been  moved to next year.     9. No comment.     10. Efforts were made with a couple of potential buyers to work out a  deal but nothing definitive was accomplished.     11.

"Rod,  The ETS Operations Administration and P&SM organization will support all of  the objectives listed below in whatever manner we can. but I feel that we can  be most directly involved with the last one:  9).  E-Commerce Strategy   We can work with the GSS organization to develop an E-Commerce Strategy and  proceed with implementation.   Some specific areas that we need more  development and implmentation of is the use of :   ""Payment on Receipts""  this eliminates the further processing of vendor  invoices related to approved purchase orders.   SAP Auto generated Purchase Orders.  - When we have designated NPA  agreements in place for specific commodities, let the system convert the  requisition to a purchase order and route to our preferred Supplier.   Use of reverse EDI - allows vendors to input verbal orders to them into  their Purchasing System and reverse create a ""Purchase Order"" into our SAP  System.   An E-Commerce system that can be implemented  anywhere within the Enron  world that provides for a quick seamless transaction from ""Cradle to Grave"" -  Requisition to Payment"".   Our implementation of an ""Integrated Supplier"" is allowing us test ground  for many of these applications with an outside Supplier partner.  Morris  I would like to see a first draft of the 2001 goals & objectives by December  11, 2000.  I specifically would like to see goals dealing with the following:  1.)

"They will be doing a lot of  maintenance activity at the plant this month.   Unfortunately, much of the key material needed to do the full turnaround  needs several months lead time.  For example, we have already ordered the  catalyst for the turnaround scheduled in March.  We discussed this yesterday  with David Bush, the plant manager, and he said they would do what they could  in December, but the critical path items would not be available until closer  to March.    The MTBE plant will be going down December 15th and the maintenance (spooge  clean up) has been accelerated so we can come back up in Mid January to take  advantage of an expected increase in MTBE margins.  As far as longer term shut down considerations go, no one seems to have a  good grasp on what the methanol market will do.  Obviously, domestic  production will be curtailed which should lift prices.  If prices rise and  January gas prices fall back below $6.00, then we would probably come back up  in January.  Regarding staffing effort, particularly in my group, the  shutdown does not significantly impact the accountants and with a high  vacation time and year-end coming up, their plates are pretty full.  At the  plant, the purchasers, contract administrator and A/P folks will actually be  busier trying to get materials  and contracts for both outages settled,  especially with the timing change for the MTBE outage.

Preliminarily, the interviews confirm our suspicions:  1. Cost & P/L reporting is the most widely held concern.  2. Cash flow reporting (treasury, direct & indirect) follows closely.  3.  There is no easy, readily available solution to FERC reporting.  4. People have lost ad hoc query functionality with the implementation of  SAP.  Project Sunrise's reporting charter will be to address these needs in the  most efficient, cost effective way possible. That could be through a data warehouse, could be through the FERC SAP module,  could be through another avenue. None of us has the answer to the methodology question yet (although we all  have ideas).  I would prefer to keep the Project Sunrise team focused on the task at hand  -- sifting through the interview information and developing a work plan. We have followup interviews to schedule & complete, a data model to build,  etc. Basically a lot of work on our plates.  However, FERC reporting is clearly a significant need that will be at the  forefront of any reporting solution. If our goal is to discuss this need in detail tomorrow, I'm all for it! I  need the education. If our goal is to look at progress towards a solution, we should look to  postpone. I take responsibility for distracting efforts in progress, but believe the  delay worthwhile.  One final issue: Sean, the Sensecorp consultant who has been working on the  project, is in California. We may want to wait on his participation.

"I don't think we can wait. We need FERC solutions in SAP (and perhaps the  data warehouse) relatively quickly.  We have an ""enterprise"" issue localized in ETS -if that helps getting any  action.  Fundamentally, through my recent ""investigation"" I have become acquainted  with numerous significant FERC module and FERC related issues -with little  apparent solution to date. The items are being worked...  Composite depreciation is not correct  -millions of $ SAP natural accounts do not reconcile to the FERC module -the FERC trial  balance does NOT balance Labor distribution true-ups are not correct for FERC purposes -costs are  being misallocated  (this was originally deemed a show stopper) AFUDC is not calculating consistently with pre SAP methodologies FERC ledgers are not available FERC ""Users"" were ready to test out the FERC data warehouse but that  opportunity was nixed by the decisions below We are unable to obtain detailed benefit information for rate purposes Benefits have been charged out incorrectly (nearly resolved) Anxiety issue >We have little confidence we'll be able to efficiently prepare  timely year end FERC Form2 reports* for Enron pipelines (submission deadlines  for which are well before any Project Sunrise timetable.)  * there is voluminous revenue/volume, financial, property and tax related  data required for this document, all of which has to be stated in FERC format.

Preliminarily, the interviews confirm our suspicions:  1. Cost & P/L reporting is the most widely held concern.  2. Cash flow reporting (treasury, direct & indirect) follows closely.  3.  There is no easy, readily available solution to FERC reporting.  4. People have lost ad hoc query functionality with the implementation of  SAP.  Project Sunrise's reporting charter will be to address these needs in the  most efficient, cost effective way possible. That could be through a data warehouse, could be through the FERC SAP module,  could be through another avenue. None of us has the answer to the methodology question yet (although we all  have ideas).  I would prefer to keep the Project Sunrise team focused on the task at hand  -- sifting through the interview information and developing a work plan. We have followup interviews to schedule & complete, a data model to build,  etc. Basically a lot of work on our plates.  However, FERC reporting is clearly a significant need that will be at the  forefront of any reporting solution. If our goal is to discuss this need in detail tomorrow, I'm all for it! I  need the education. If our goal is to look at progress towards a solution, we should look to  postpone. I take responsibility for distracting efforts in progress, but believe the  delay worthwhile.  One final issue: Sean, the Sensecorp consultant who has been working on the  project, is in California. We may want to wait on his participation.  I believe we are all on the same page. mhf ---------------------- Forwarded by Mark Frank/HOU/ECT on 12/04/2000 02:04 PM  ---------------------------   Ozlem Mahmood@EES 12/04/2000 01:16 PM To: Mark Frank/HOU/ECT@ECT cc:   Subject: Re: FERC Data Warehouse  FYI: ---------------------- Forwarded by Ozlem Mahmood/HOU/EES on 12/04/2000 01:14  PM ---------------------------   Melissa Becker@ENRON 12/04/2000 11:16 AM To: David McEllin/FGT/Enron@ENRON cc: Ozlem Mahmood/HOU/EES@EES, Sheila Howard/Corp/Enron@ENRON  Subject: Re: FERC Data Warehouse    Why wouldn't we?

"For O&M fees at interconnects NBPL has been charging the customer an  estimated incremental cost, which under the cost of service tariff was  credited back to O&M (where the incremental costs were originally charged).   We are definitely going to change this now.  In at least one situation in the past, NPNG had the contract for maintaining  a short lateral for the Synfuels plant in ND (in fact Phil may have been  involved with this when he was District Manager in Glasgow).  In that case, a  small amount of O&M was left at NPNG and the revenue was booked at NPNG.    In most cases the customer is negotiating the fees as a part of service on  NBPL and I would suggest that unless these are significant contracts the  amounts be left at NBPL.

Several of NBPL's customers are currently waiting for answers on this issue  and NBPL needs to respond very soon to these customers.  NBPL has been asked  to renegotiate fees (PGL&C) as well as set fees for a period of longer than 1  year (Harvest States).  NBPL has also been asked to operate a 1/2 mile of  line from a meter station to a power plant (Lakefield Junction).

With the tariff changes, operating fees will  not automatically be recovered in the future.  How are these operating fees  going to be tracked and charged?  Does NBPL charge all interconnect customers  the same fee?  Should NBPL absorb some or all of the operating costs as a  cost of doing business?  These questions need to be answered at the meeting.

We are definitely going to change this now.  In at least one situation in the past, NPNG had the contract for maintaining  a short lateral for the Synfuels plant in ND (in fact Phil may have been  involved with this when he was District Manager in Glasgow).  In that case, a  small amount of O&M was left at NPNG and the revenue was booked at NPNG.    In most cases the customer is negotiating the fees as a part of service on  NBPL and I would suggest that unless these are significant contracts the  amounts be left at NBPL.  The main reasons are accounting ease, avoidance of  fiduciary issues, and customer relations.

A meeting to discuss this issue and how Operations will determine  these fees, is scheduled for Monday, December 18, on your calendar.  Your  input is very important at this meeting.  Several of NBPL's customers are currently waiting for answers on this issue  and NBPL needs to respond very soon to these customers.  NBPL has been asked  to renegotiate fees (PGL&C) as well as set fees for a period of longer than 1  year (Harvest States).  NBPL has also been asked to operate a 1/2 mile of  line from a meter station to a power plant (Lakefield Junction).  We need to  agree on a decision from both a business and an operations perspective.   Currently, we have estimated operating fees at interconnects where we charge  a fee and charge a standard monthly fee of $2,000 per month with the  exception of two interconnects.  With the tariff changes, operating fees will  not automatically be recovered in the future.  How are these operating fees  going to be tracked and charged?  Does NBPL charge all interconnect customers  the same fee?  Should NBPL absorb some or all of the operating costs as a  cost of doing business?  These questions need to be answered at the meeting.

"We are still working on the plane, and the answer is that the plane will be  billed to the RC reserving it for the flight.

The budget will be taken care of in Planning as we go through the  year.

This was the detail provided to Sarabeth. ---------------------- Forwarded by Rod Hayslett/FGT/Enron on 12/13/2000  07:04 AM ---------------------------  12/11/2000 10:07 AM John Jesse   To: Sarabeth Smith/OTS/Enron@ENRON cc: Rod Hayslett/FGT/Enron@ENRON, Jerry Peters/NPNG/Enron@ENRON   Subject: Lease Option on Trailblazer  To recap our recent discussion, my understanding was that you were looking  for an Enron or NBP entity to serve as the lessor in a lease financing  transaction that would be offered as an option in the pending EAMR bid for  the Trailblazer construction project.  Since such transaction would need to  be priced based upon the credit rating of the entity or the sponsors  (depending upon the structure) the expected returns will not justify the  balance sheet impact on Northern Border Partners if this entity were to  function as lessor.  Furthermore, I have assumed that this conclusion also  holds true from Enron's perspective given their strategy of reserving balance  sheet capacity for higher return projects.  Since the bid parameters do not specify a lease requirement, Trailblazer may  already have funding in place.  If not, EAMR could insert language in the bid  that they or their designee would arrange lease financing for the project  upon selection of EAMR as the winning bidder.  At that point, we would work  with commercial banks or major leasing companies to develop a cost-effective  financing transaction.  I hope this addresses your questions regarding the feasibility of such a  transaction, but please call me at x7843 in Omaha if you wish to discuss  further.  Good luck with your bid!

I do feel that  Dave needs to step up to the plate and start delivering some new and creative  solutions for outstanding issues.  He has the capabilities.   It seems he  tends to manage too much by wandering around and not taking the lead.  I fully support Barney's rating, but could see both Dave and Larry's ratings  being on the lower edge of the recommended ratings.

It will alter our procurement  timing a little if we do delay our overhauls to next year (we would be buying  the long lead, high dollar stuff this quarter even if we do delay), but it  seems clear that it is in Enron's best interest to make those slight changes.   I will let our controller and Finance Manager know what's up just to keep  them informed.  They may be helpful to us in figuring out how to get the  rebate to come into GPG through Enron Methanol Company or Enron Clean Fuels.

"ON further reflection, if Mavrix is to be a wholly owned sub of Enron  Pipeline Company (or whatever the current name is of the top-tier ETS entity)  then that entity ought to issue the guaranty.  Mavrix intends to buy capacity  from TW and possibly NN.  It would be innappropriate to have TW issue the  guaranty if TWs guaranty would likely operate in favor of TW.  Same for NN.

Therefore we haven't given Mavrix a special deal compared to  other shippers, since they are now by way of the guarantee creditworthy.     As I told you on the phone, Enron will do this for others as well, it's just  not cheap, it's like dealing with the guys in the pool hall!

Will this prove that granting credit was  non-discriminatory?  I would argue no, since we don't look at the  consideration paid for guarantees of other companies.  The fact that a  credit-worthy party has issued a guarantee should be enough.  Legally, Mavix  is a separate company.  Parent companies frequently guarantee obligations of  subsidiaries without any direct consideration (other than enabling their  subsidiary to transact business).

I don't believe I have  seen that anywhere, but had heard that it was TW.   If it is not a subsidiary  of NNG why would NNG issue a guaranty for Mavrix?     I can have the  guarantee priced and then Mavrix can pay to have someone guarantee it's  positions.     This is not rocket science, but I believe we need to make an  effort to keep things looking like they are at arms length and that this is a  separate company.     If you all agree, let me know and I can have someone  get with Steve Harris and get the guaranty priced.  For Jerry and John:   Let me know but I think we can get this priced down  here inside the day.     Let me know how you want to proceed.

You  also wouldn't want to go outside of ETS because of marketing affiliate  issues.  By process of elimination, I guess I'm OK with NN issuing the  guarantee.  In my view, if Mavrix' commercial strategies are unsuccessful and  Northern has to perform on the guarantee, good luck recovering any of those  dollars in Northern's next rate case.  Thanks.

"ROD:  This is the second memo, along with the note I sent to Blaine at the bottom.  So, suggest you read my note to Blaine first.  Regards. Les  ---------------------- Forwarded by Les Webber/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT on 02/20/2001 02:04 PM ---------------------------   ""Yamagata, Blaine"" <byamagata@AKINGUMP.COM> on 02/19/2001 11:33:52 AM To: ""'Les.Webber@enron.com'"" <Les.Webber@enron.com> cc: ""'nancy.corbet@enron.com'"" <nancy.corbet@enron.com>   Subject: RE: AKIN GUMP - Draft Enron Stripping Memo.DOC   Les:  With regard to the conclusions you have drawn from my memo, I have the following initial thoughts:  (1) While SLNG might have a difficult time demonstrating that the 1075 Btu/cf standard is necessary for the safe and efficient operation of the system, the allocation of the burden of proof would not require that SLNG prove its position.  The 1075 level currently is in SLNG's tariff and, I believe, would be presumed by the FERC to be the level that is necessary for the safe and efficient operation of its system.  If Enron wished to challenge the number now, it most likely would have to do so pursuant to a Section 5 complaint proceeding initiated by Enron.  Assuming that the Commission agreed that the matter should be docketed and subject to further proceedings, Enron would bear the burden of proof for demonstrating that the 1075 level is not just and reasonable.  Further, while Gene would need to be consulted, challenging the Btu level arguably might be construed as a breach of the October 13 agreements.  (2) While I obviously agree that there is no specific ceiling on the Btu content for gas in the tariff of Southern Natural Gas, it is likely that both the pipeline and its downstream customers, both direct and indirect, would raise the ""merchantability"" issue.  (3) I agree that the gas treating and conditioning examples do not include removal of liquids and that the examples support the extraction of liquids as a processing function, rather than treatment or conditioning. Relying on those specific examples, however, is not without risk.  Specifically, the status of facilities will be decided on the basis of a ""primary function"" test, which looks at all of the facts and circumstances.  It is because of that uncertainty that I am unable to provide Enron with a definitive statement that facilities used to strip liquids would be treated as non-jurisdictional.  I do think, however, we would have the better side of the argument, if we can show that there is an real economic benefit to be gained from removing the liquids and separately selling them.  The Commission recognizes that a single facility may be providing multiple services and if we can demonstrate that the primary purpose is to sell the liquids for a profit, I believe we can qualify the plant as a processing facility.  Moreover, I think that SLNG and its downstream customers would be hard-pressed to object to the facility being treated as a non-jurisdictional facility.  First, if built by Enron and/or others, none of the costs would be included in SLNG's cost of service.  Second, downstream customers will get the benefit of additional gas supplies and would not ""lose"" any gas since the plant operator, as a matter of contract, will likely be required to return ""thermally equivalent"" volumes, which are discussed in the memo.  Third, SLNG gets what it wants because it keeps downstream customers ""happy"" while also enabling the terminal to accept LNG from sources other than Trinidad.  Finally, if SLNG were to build the liquids extraction plant as a conditioning or treating plant and include the costs in its cost of service, it may also be required to credit back to those customers the ""profits"" from the sale of liquids.  Conversely, if SLNG builds the plant as a processing plant, shippers could, by contract, retain title to the higher Btus and pay SLNG a processing fee.  Depending on the level of the processing fee and the liquids market, that might not be economically attractive to SLNG or a processing affiliate.   On the matter of a ""seat at the table"" I now better understand what you desire.  That concept, however, needs further thought by me since I have no ready recommendation about how to achieve that goal through the regulatory process.  -----Original Message----- From: Les.Webber@enron.com [mailto:Les.Webber@enron.com] Sent: Sunday, February 18, 2001 5:40 PM To: byamagata@AKINGUMP.COM; nancy.corbet@enron.com Cc: Daniel.R.Rogers@enron.com Subject: Re: AKIN GUMP - Draft Enron Stripping Memo.DOC    BLAINE:  I have read your draft memo and I have the following comments ""off the top of my head"".  First, after you read my e-mail from earlier today, you will see that the ""seat at the table"" concept is focused on El Paso Merchant Energy providing us with ""Customer"" status in dealing with Southern LNG, in whatever manner and to whatever extent would be reasonably consistent therewith.  This would be intended to give us the best possible standing with the FERC.  It would not limit our rights to those set forth in the Quality Letter Agreement.  It would allow us to address a number of solutions to the quality issue at Elba and give us rights to involve the FERC if Southern LNG attempted to behave in an unduly discriminatory manner, etc.  In summary, this a general concept, as opposed to one looking specifically at the stripping alternative.  Second, I think your draft memo does actually address the issue of jurisdictional and non-jurisdictional facilities, although I would like to see a conclusion or two.  Let me tell you mine.    Southern LNG would have a difficult time ever proving that LNG receipts    above the 1075 Btu per cf spec at the Elba Island LNG Terminal    represents a safety, operational or efficiency concern within the    Terminal, even though, admittedly, it is outside their specs.  The other    US LNG Terminals are proof of the opposite.    Southern LNG would have a difficult time proving the same for the    downstream Southern Natural Gas pipeline system, particularly since the    vaporized LNG is not outside the specs of that system.    The gas ""conditioning"" and ""treating"" examples never seem to include gas    liquids removal per se.  ""Treating"" talks about removal of acid gases    and water, not gas liquids.  ""Conditioning"" would appear to encompass    the removal of gas liquids to the extent required in achieving    ""hydrocarbon dew point control"".  Any LNG we would import would pass    that standard.    It could be argued that the addition of air or nitrogen would be open to    arguments on both sides of the jurisdiction issue, although it involves    an addition, not a removal.  Since it does not impact safety, operations    or efficiency, the facilities could be non-jurisdictional.  However, you    would have to have all the downstream customers on board or the    customers, along with Southern LNG, would force the FERC to take    jurisdiction by some mechanism.    On the other hand, the gas liquids stripping alternative would most    likely achieve non-jurisdictional treatment.  There are economics    involved with the gas liquids, the downstream customers would be    supportive, and one could argue that it is discretionary in terms of the    LNG - i.e. it would not be intended to strip all LNG.  The next step would appear to be to conference with Nancy and agree upon the path forward in your analysis.  Regards.

Under the FERC's standards of conduct, the pipelines cannot: (1) share transportation information or shipper information with EES; (2) must function independently and keep separate books and records.  Generally, I don't see the FERC having any problem with mechanical, electrical, air-conditioning types of services.  However; there are 2 specific concerns that arise with respect to the described arrangement under the FERC's marketing affiliate standards of conduct:  1. Records -- FERC has ruled that giving a marketing affiliate ""access"" to transportation and shipper records (including something as simple as file room access) is deemed to be impermissibly sharing the information with a marketing affiliate in violation of the standards. Thus, it seems to me that EES will explicitly not be able to perform any records management function for NNG, TW or NBPL.  2. Billing -  FERC scrutinizes intercompany charges carefully.  In a recent Kinder-Morgan consent order, the FERC used payroll and intercompany charge records to make the case that the pipeline and marketing affiliate did not operate separately.  It would be helpful if any EES facility management charges/allocations come from Enron Facility Services (not EES) --  leaving us room to argue that the facility management subsidiary involves separate functions and staff than the EES subsidiary that is a marketing affiliate.

The areas affected include facility operations and maintenance of mechanical, electrical, and air-conditioning systems; mail delivery;  housekeeping;  food, copier, and records services.  This transition of services, as presently managed by Enron Property and Services Corp. (EPSC), is designed to optimize value to Enron's Business Units by leveraging facility management businesses now offered by EES to their commercial customers.  EPSC staff having administrative responsibility for these services will report to Enron Facility Services, a subsidiary of EES's Global Energy Services group led by Daniel Leff, President and CEO.  EPSC is responsible for Enron's internal real estate and office development needs, including leasing, space allocations and facility planning, project and construction management, furniture systems, and office relocation.  EPSC, in its development role, remains a part of Enron Corporate Administration Services (ECAS) along with Corporate Security and the Aviation Department, reporting to Bill Donovan, Vice President, Corporate Administrative Services.  This alignment of responsibilities offers the opportunity for EPSC to focus resources on effective utilization of our existing office space assets and managing the development of Houston's new Enron Center Campus project.      <Embedded StdOleLink>",haysletr@flash.net,rod.hayslett@enron.com,Mkt Affiliate Implications: Reorganization of Houston and Omaha  Facilities Management Responsibilities,2001-02-21 10:58:00-08:00,sent

Enron through a separate investment in ECOutlook in 2000 currently owns 6% of the company.  Once Enron executes the warrant we would own a total of 7% of the company.  ECOutlook's current customer list includes Bausch & Lomb, Bristol-Meyers, Ciba-Vision, BASF, Dupont, Equistar/Lyondell, Perseco(McDonalds), Sun Microsystems, SYSCO, Pentacon and others.    Enron's EDI Hub currently processes the following types of transactions:  Products     Internal C/P's External     Documents Gas 5 69 Nominations Schedule Quantities     Quick Response Capacity      Meter Statements      Imbalance              Electric 4 20 Enrollments Meter Info     Terminations Usage     Switch Notice Payments     Rate Confirmation      Invoices      Billing      Purchase Order         Financial 8 20 Checks Acknowledgements     Direct Deposits Utility Invoices     Advices Consolidated Billing     Issuances      Financial Report      Wire Transfers   The existing IP related to these types of transactions is now owned by ECPower and they will have the right to market it to other customers.    Enron has also entered into a five-year O&M agreement and will transition the operations of it's EDI Hub from ECPower to ECOutlook over the next six-months.  The O&M rates are flat to our deal with ECPower.    Enron also paid $100,000 to purchase a license to ECOutlook's B2B connectivity software called SDI Server.  We are looking at ways to use this software to assist data transformation efforts between EIM, EGM and their trading partners.

"The reason there is no tax grossup is that there is no cash up front in either case.    This can also be accomplished if NNG does the deal without cash up front from the customer.      Case A, can be done merely because it is a construction deal for the customer.    That can be done with or without an EAMR in the mix (except for the construction) and actually get us a benefit  in a future rate case as whatever is left of the value at that point in time becomes rate based.    Case B on the other hand can be done by any one, including the pipe.     I don't think we intend to be owning facilities for the transportation/measurement of natural gas in EAMR or otherwise outside of the pipelines, unless someone presents and gets approved a business plan that would argue the return is better than owning the facilities inside the pipeline.   -----Original Message----- From:  Smith, Sarabeth   Sent: Friday, March 02, 2001 5:21 PM To: Dushinske, John Cc: Stage, Michael G.; Marye, David; Hawkins, Don; Hayslett, Rod; Geaccone, Tracy Subject: RE: EAMR Interconnect and Measurement Services   John, Rod may have been thinking of a different scenario than what I have been pursuing.  The scenario currently on the table has two possibilities: Case A:  EAMR engineers, procures and constructs (EPC) the interconnect and/or measurement facilities for the customer.  The customer then holds title to the facilities and EAMR operates the facilities for them under a long term contract.  When the contract is terminated, the facilities are conveyed to either EAMR or the pipeline at a much smaller value (current market value for the used facilities at that point in the future).    Case B:  EAMR does EPC, owns and operates the facilities and then contracts with the customer for a long term interconnect service fee (possibly in cents/MMBtu or a lump sum dollar amount monthly) to recover the capital with a good return and operating costs plus a margin.  Robert Guthrie of the Tax Department has indicated that he believes these mechanisms will work.  EAMR would not be required to add a tax gross up for the contribution in aid of construction (CAC) because neither of the deals are structured with a CAC.  EAMR would only have to pay income tax on the profit made on either Case A or Case B annually.  More work needs to be done to work through these scenarios to see if they are completely feasible.  Since Case B involves capital and is much more complex, I have been concentrating on Case A and saving B for the future.    Michelle Lokay has been working with Pogo Producing on a new interconnect to TW and we are using that interconnect as an example to see if there are expanded services that can be offered.

We had a meeting w/ ETS Financial Planning last week and I asked if we could have EAMR play a role and thus avoid requiring the customer to true up for income taxes.

Cc: Cobb, John Subject: TW Expansion Overhead Rate Sensitivity: Confidential  For your consideration:  The proposed TW expansion is using a 2% construction overhead rate. The rate was based on an earlier analysis I did on the impact on the overhead rate at various levels of capital expenditure -using a constant 2001 TW Overhead Plan.     Rate Background The 2001 TW Overhead Plan is $1.4million, and the 2001 Capital Budget eligible for Overheads is $9.9 million, resulting in a Overhead rate of 14.1%; which has been rounded to 15% for use on TW routine capital for 2001.  The analysis that resulted in the 2% rate was based on an expansion estimate of $60 million. Holding the overhead estimate at $1.4 million, and using a revised capital budget (including a $60mm expansion estimate), resulted in total capital eligible for overheads  of approx. $70 million.  This them imputes to the 2% rate (Overheads/Capital; $1.4mm/$70mm).  Subsequently, a $90+ million expansion estimate was developed, and the above 2% rate stayed in place. With a $90 million expansion, total TW capital eligible for overheads would be approximately $100mm. Applying the 2% rate would result in imputed overheads of $1.8mm; $.4mm higher than plan, and reasonable given the magnitude of the most recent expansion estimate.  Overhead Background FYI- The level of expense charged to TW overheads in 2000 was $4 million (if applied to the above capital budget and $90 million expansion the effective rate would be 4%).  But, as stated above the 2001 Plan was $1.4 million. January and February charges to the overhead are tracking close to Plan.  FGT's incremental facilities, Phase IV ($250mm)and V($450mm) expansions are using a 3% rate.  ""Bottom Line"" - to me - an Overhead rate in the range of 2% to 4% is reasonable.

"Rod,  I mentioned to you that we had met with the Enron SAP team several weeks ago to discuss pros and cons of Azurix Corp. moving to SAP.  Our main reason for exploring this was the fact that key functions in closing our Oracle books, due to attrition, were only known by one employee.  This employee is a manager (Virginia Krobot), and the other remaining permanent accounting staff is an accounting clerk and two A/P people.  There are some parts of the closing that are only being performed by AccountTemps personnel.  We are transitioning these to Azurix employees as we can.  I spoke today to Mark Schmidt with the SAP team.  I told him before we moved any further on exploring this option, I thought we should get your thoughts.    If we lose the manager in our group we will have difficulty closing the books.  As you can imagine, Azurix does not have much attractiveness to potential employees to supplement our current staff, and given the direction we are heading, it doesn't make sense to recruit new staff.  In addition, a conversion will not come cheap, although the SAP team was not planning on a full implementation.  They used the term ""SAP trial balance company.""

"Rod,  We get one template from each operating company at a specified level in the ownership chain.  This template contains the minimum number of accounts necessary in order to achieve our external reporting requirements.  For example, an operating company will submit a template with only one G&A account.  However, they will report interest expense gross of capitalized interest since we disclose our capitalized interest in a footnote.  Any intercompany accounts which get eliminated in consolidation are detailed out.  The templates are manually entered into Oracle.  Most of the Cayco's and BV companies which sit above the operating companies only have equity earnings and interest expense/income type entries and those are accounted for here.  Azurix Corp. has more detail type entries but these are primarily G&A, DD&A, intercompany billings and equity earnings.

The decison to convert would depend on the risk of not converting (available accounting personel as referred to below and presumably system support personnel as well....Mike Sullivan and I are making some inquiries about the current support resources), the cost of converting and how long do we think we'll have this issue.  The phrase Kenny Bickett refers to below ....""SAP trail balance company""  I believe implies that the accounting would be done outside SAP and monthly balances loaded to SAP to facilitate consolidated reporting (e.g., EOTT is a trial balance company).

I just found out that our TW drag reduceing project created 80,000 in new capacity, not 40,000.  But, as originally designed, the San Juan lateral could only transport 810,000/day rather than its certificated capacity of 850,000, and it was not designed to take into account fuel usage.  So, of the 80,000 of new capacity, 40,000 goes to bring it back to certificated levels  and 40,000 goes to compensate for fuel usage.

Our attorneys commented that  the legal fees to accomplish that (when we have a public offering going on)  may ""chew up"" the benefits.  But that is their normal reaction - I don't  think there will be any problem in accomplishing the placement.

About Coppelia Copp?lia was first performed on May 25, 1870 at the Th?atre Imp?rial de L'Op?ra, featuring choreography by Arthur Saint-L?on and music by L?o Delibes. The work maintains a special place in the history of dance, serving as a kind of bridge from the glory of the French Romantic ballet in the early nineteenth century to the masterpieces of the Russian Imperial Theater at the turn of the century. Writing in The International Dictionary of Ballet, critic Karen Dacko analyzes the unique characteristics of the piece as follows: ""Copp?lia owes its longevity to its inspired, very danceable score. But the ballet is also remarkable for its perennial appeal and for its historical significance as Romanticism's grand finale and classical ballet's prologue."" Copp?lia first entered Houston Ballet' repertoire in October 1974, in a staging by Frederic Franklin (who also performed the role of Dr. Copp?lius), and featuring scenery by Peter Farmer. In November 1979, former Royal Ballet ballerina Anne Heaton re-staged the work for the company. When Houston Ballet premiered its new production of the work in March 1992 featuring breathtaking d?cor by Desmond Heeley, Carl Cunningham of The Houston Post wrote, ""It would be hard to imagine anything to cap the joyous, gentle, and glorious looking new production of Copp?lia the splendidly prepared company of dancers and musicians put forth Thursday evening on Wortham Center's Brown Theater stage."" (The Houston Post, March 21, 1992)  Heeley's designs for Copp?lia never fail to enchant, most notably in the second-act depiction of Dr. Copp?lius's workshop. The sampling of dolls on display pay  homage to the era when automatons, or mechanical toys, were the rage in Europe -- and to Heeley's inexhaustible creativity.

"If the six directors are Chandler, Cobb, Wiederholt, Geaccone, Keiser, and Concklin and the one VP is Saunders - I agree.

We are in the process of completing our  May closing but the IBIT number for May is 99% complete. The June forecast  was prepared last month and we are now in the process of updating our forecast  of power cost and IBIT for June. We should complete that next week. Curves  in the west continue to come down which will potentially reduce our IBIT for  June, but I will know more next week.   The spreadsheet shows 70.1 million IBIT compared to what I provided you early  this week of 65 million. The primary difference is power cost and our view  that given the current movement in wholesale prices from May 8 that power cost  could rise by an additional 5 million from that level. We are currently in  the dead band zone for the PCA so any change in power cost go right to IBIT.  There is one other issue related to power cost concerning our need to  potentially increase our reserves for the California receivables. AA  continues to push us on this issue to increase the amount of reserves. If we  have a good June we might want to increase our reserves, however this is  something we will talk with Bob Butz about early next month when June results  are available.

"Rod, I hear you.  However, what's changed since the last time you and I spoke about this project is that our friend Bill Wise has been talking with the Chairman of Pemex about doing a similar (180 mile) expansion of El Paso's system from Waha to Samalayuca.  His proposal was to provide incremental firm service to Pemex at EPNG's currently effective ""Texas"" rates (low 20 cent range).  Pemex management is willing to recommend to its Board of Directors going with a slightly higher rate on TransPecos in order to get the benefits of supply diversity and leverage, but the TransPecos rate needs to be as close to EPNG's as possible to make the case compelling.    Therefore, what we're trying to accomplish here is to give Pemex a rate representing effectively a rate cap, with an ""upside"" that if the FERC rate is less than the cap (which it might well be), then Pemex gets the lower rate.  It's just going to be damned difficult to hit a McGwire home run here with El Paso breathing down our neck.

"There has been no major concerns.  Jo Williams wanted to revise the marketing flow chart to show that either the marketing vp, pricing desk or trader will initiate a decision to enter into a position.  I did specify in this draft that the head trader would review, approve and sign off on the Daily Position and P&L Reports after the close of each business day.    There are some main differences in the way Caminus calculates VaR and the way Enron Corp. calculates VaR.  These differences include:  - Enron Corp. uses approximately 60 buckets of time while Caminus is limited to 12 buckets of time - ETS loads in the price curves every night while Enron Corp. usually loads the curves every two weeks.  Right now Enron Corp.'s VaR models are being revised and it is difficult to see how far off we are.  With respects to correlations, we are really close on all except for those related to San Juan and Socal.   - Enron Corp. use implied volatility while Caminus uses historical volatilities.    Vernon Mercaldo is working with me to find why there is a difference in correlations with San Juan and Socal.

"Sorry for the delayed response, however, I was not in the office last week.  Originally, on moving Azurix back into Enron CRM, it was decided to leave Azurix on a separate insurance program to retain flexibility for potential sale activity.  (We did combine them into the Enron Directors and Officers Liability program as Azurix could no longer carry their own coverage, following the ownership change.)  We have not considered the options in the event of a sale, should Wessex and a select few assets not be included.  I understand that the current liability limit maintained by Azurix is $600,000,000.  The Enron limit is more than that.  As an Enron subsidiary, low liability limits are not acceptable and in those cases where ""separate"" programs are purchased,  the excess amount above the separate program is maintained here.  I am traveling tomorrow and will return to the office Wednesday before noon.  We need to meet and discuss.

I am proposing to cost this on the basis of reverting back to a standalone insurance programme for Wessex as opposed to being part of the Azurix Global Insurance Programme.  The main reasons for this are:  Following the hefty premium rise in 2001 the global programme is now on a par with a standalone programme with regard premiums but more expensive overall due to the much higher excess levels at Azurix.  Due to the above it could easily be argued that the global programme is not offering best value for Wessex acting as a standalone company which of course it must do under its licence - this causes potential 'RAG 5' problems with the regulator.  The levels of coverage previously enjoyed by Wessex prior to the global programme had been more than adequate for approximately 10 years.  If AZX assets are sold this year there may be no need for an Azurix programme but to consider absorbing Wessex into any Enron programme will probably only add to the problems above given that Wessex and Enron are such diverse entities in terms of size, activities, locations and therefore insurable risk.

In addition to bringing an estimated savings of 20%, ClickTrip is easy to use and is accessible 24 hours a day from any internet-enabled personal computer.  After-hours telephone support is also available.  When making travel reservations, please purchase non-refundable coach tickets when flying in the U.S., for these tickets can cost up to 65% less than refundable tickets and can usually be changed, if necessary, for a $100 fee.  ?

"Rod -  As you suggested, I put all your companies into one ""portfolio"" to treat them separately in our risk management policy.  The vast majority of verbiage in the policy is specifically relegated to the trading portfolio, but I'll be sure to walk you through it next week and highlight anything that addresses this portfolio.  These portfolios really just represent different buckets of risk:  1) Trading Portfolio 2) Merchant Portfolio 3) Regulated Domestic Asset Portfolio 4) Retail Portfolio 5) Other Assets and Contracts Portfolio 6) Capital Portfolio  Would you also help me think of a good name for this portfolio (#3)?  I'm struggling with it a bit - if I just say Transportation and Distribution, it's misleading because Elektro and related assets are excluded, if I add ""Domestic"" to the name, it wouldn't cover Wessex, etc..  Take a quick look at the descriptions of the portfolio categories below, and you'll see how I'm trying to capture the entire company, but carve your businesses out.  Another question - is it valid to distinguish trading activity included in Enron's DPR and that carried out - or to be carried out - by your businesses (PGE, ETS, EOTT), as all the activity in your companies is accrual accounting?  Or will some be marked to market?  Thank you, Cassandra x30429. 2.1 Mark-to-Market Trading Portfolio The Company's Mark-to-Market Trading Portfolio (Trading Portfolio) is designed to capture and manage risks related to commodity sales and services, including the purchase, sale, marketing and delivery of energy and other commodities, to provide related risk management services, and to take advantage of market arbitrage opportunities and manage positions within the approved limits.  This Portfolio includes the Commodity Groups listed in Appendix ___, accounted for using a mark-to-market method. 2.2 Fair Value Merchant Portfolio The Company's Fair Value Merchant Portfolio (Merchant Portfolio) is designed to capture and manage risks related to merchant investments in public and private companies, including the active management of embedded exposures, and to provide greater liquidity and transparency for the Company's merchant investment activities. This portfolio includes equity, ""equity-like,"" debt and ""debt-like"" instruments in the public and private sector.  2.3 Regulated Domestic Asset Portfolio The  Regulated Domestic Asset Portfolio is designed to capture and manage risks related to the business activities of the Company's government regulated subsidiaries and affiliates (.e.g. pipelines and utilities).  While these subsidiaries and affiliates may engage in some activities similar to those in the Company's other Portfolios, their activities may have  specific accounting and legal and regulatory requirements that require separate application of risk management practices. 2.4 Retail Portfolio The Company's Retail Portfolio is designed to capture and manage exposures inherent in the energy services business, particularly those related to credit, as it records the sale to or management of commodities on behalf of customers, and the provision of integrated outsourcing solutions   for energy management. 2.5 Other Assets and Contracts Portfolio The Company's Other Assets and Contracts Portfolio is designed to capture and manage exposures and risks embedded in  assets and other investments, liabilities and contractual arrangements that are accounted for generally on an ""accruals"" basis or are not otherwise captured in the other Portfolios defined in this Policy.  This portfolio includes:  operating assets throughout the Company's network of selective domestic and international asset ownership,  ii) contracts that provide access to third-party assets and market-making activities, and  iii) off-balance sheet or contingent contracts.  2.6 Capital Portfolio The Capital Portfolio is designed to capture and manage exposures inherent in positions and transactions involving Enron's own stock, issued debt and other funding transactions, or derivatives thereof, which may occur from time to time .",rod.hayslett@enron.com,cassandra.schultz@enron.com,Portfolio Name,2001-07-17 10:38:35-07:00,received

The company-wide campaign along with Week of Caring kicks off on August 6.  ETS' Day of Caring is on August 9 at the Harboch Ripley Center in southeast Houston.  Please contact Kimberly Nelson to volunteer for a morning or afternoon shift at ETS' Day of Caring.     To celebrate a successful Campaign and Week of Caring, an employee appreciation lunch will be held on Friday, August 10, at 11:00 am at Antioch Park across the street from the Enron building.  In correlation with this year's United Way campaign theme, ""Building Houston's Future,"" and in the true spirit of Enron, there will be a building competition among the business units at the lunch.     Each business unit will form a team and build something with building blocks at the August 10 appreciation event.     Rod Hayslett, Phil Lowry and I will lead Team ETS.  To form the rest of Team ETS, we thought it would be fun to have a little contest.     Here's the contest:  Correctly answer all of the questions in the link below by Wednesday, August 1, at 5pm, and your name will be entered into a drawing.  NO late entries will be accepted.   We'll draw 7 names from the entries received and if your name is drawn, you will be an official member of Team ETS and help build the most incredible structure imaginable with me, Rod and Phil.  We'll announce the lucky winners on Thursday, August 2.     At the August 10 celebration, all of the business unit building block structures will be built and judged based on Enron's attributes - smart, innovative, bold, ambitious, and united.

"FYI  -----Original Message----- From: Piro, Jim  Sent: Friday, August 03, 2001 5:15 PM To: Hayslett, Rod; Horton, Stanley; FOWLER, PEGGY Cc: Lobdell, Jim; Stevens, Kirk; JOHNSON, Ron W Subject: California Receivables and FERC Proceedings   The following is in answer to your question concerning our current assessment of our exposure related to the FERC proceeding looking at refunds for sales to the California PX and ISO.  This information on the FERC process was provided by Ron Johnson who is actively representing PGE in these proceedings.  For the period October  through February  we sold net power to the Cal ISO and PX  for $82 million ($93 million of sales and $11million of purchases),  of this amount approximately $34 million was for power sold under the DOE order to sell.  All sales to the Cal ISO and PX in 2001 were done under the DOE order.  To date we have received payments of $12 million which leaves a current outstanding receivable of $70 million.  Sales under the DOE order are not subject to refund in the current proceeding, however there is a possibility of a separate proceeding in the future on these transactions.  Of the $59 million of sales & $11 million of purchases that were not covered under the DOE order,  FERC will determine based upon a pricing methodology how much these amounts should be reduced by.  The reduction will be based upon the difference in the proxy price and the actual sales prices for each hour times the amount of KWH sold in that hour.  The proxy price for each hour will be determined by FERC in a proceeding that will start in about two weeks and will end with a decision sometime in late September.  The proxy price for each hour will be based on the heat rate of the marginal unit being dispatched in each hour in California times the hourly gas price for the area where the unit is located based upon a published index plus $6/MWH for O&M.   FERC will not entertain any discussions on using each company's marginal cost to determine what their proxy price should be for its specific sales.  Without the specific data on which plant was the marginal unit and what the gas price was on that hour for that unit we are not able to accurately predict what the refund amount might be.  We have made some estimates of what the refund could be given a set of assumptions on heat rate and gas prices and we think it may be in the $25 million range (high of $30 and low of $20 million).  We are continuing to work on this estimate and will have a better number next week.   In addition, FERC has stated that we will receive interest on all unpaid balances, net of the refunds, at the FERC approved interest rate which will help offset this exposure.  Since none of this forecasted exposure is for 2001 sales all of the refunds would be charged against earnings.  Refunds related to sales under the DOE order (if they occur at all) would be mostly covered under our PCA to the extent the refunds apply to sales during January or February of 2001.  We currently have reserved on our books $7 million for general credit exposure for wholesale trading and $13.4 million for the California receivables for a total pre-tax reserve of $20.4 million.  Some of this might need to stay on the books for continuing trading credit reserves but I believe we could use most of this credit reserve to offset a write down of the receivable if necessary.  In addition, we still have the outstanding issue of getting paid from the ISO and PX and the time frame for payment given the situation with PG&E and their own bankruptcy proceeding.  No assessment of this risk has been made.  FERC has also started a proceeding on potential refunds for transactions in the Northwest.  A hearing was held on August 1 and at this point there appears to be very minimal interest by most of the big northwest parties to pursue this issue (at this point only Seattle City Light, Port of Seattle and Tacoma are pursuing refunds).  The outcome of this proceeding is still unclear but there is a reasonable likelihood that this docket could be closed with no action.  We have very minimal exposure to Seattle and Tacoma probably less than $2 million.  The discussion above does not include the receivable from SCE for the terminated power contract.   They are current on their payments of $2.667 million per month and the amount remaining due is $42.7 million.  We will provide you an additional update as we get more information from FERC on the proxy price.",tracy.geaccone@enron.com,rod.hayslett@enron.com,FW: California Receivables and FERC Proceedings,2001-08-08 05:01:25-07:00,sent

" Rod,  Here is an update on where we are at on reorganizing, in order to avoid filling the Director's position vacated by Larry Fenstad.   I met with all the OSS Directors and gave them the following attached guidelines and an opportunity to redesign the organzation, without filling back Larry's position.   The org charts below represent the organization that we have agreed to pursue.  I have met with Laura and Brian to review the organization and to have compensation review.   Gary Smith has reviewed the proposal and given his approval.     While we will encounter a couple of moves, in order to implement this, we will keep the staffing levels whole and reduce by one (1) directors position, and not increase our current estimate.   The real benefits to this organization are:  It provides better supervision and alignment with the field operations. It will provide for better training opportunities for future management positions. It will better align our consolidation efforts. It will off-load some daily supervisory responsibilities from David, Elaine and Barney. It will free up some time for David, Elaine and Barney to better oversee and improve the quality of the financial data.  When we get some of the following issues resolved and working smoothly, I feel we will be able to support and possibly downsize from our current staffing levels:  SAP ADAYTUM DATA WAREHOUSE iBUYIT iPayit SAP Timekeeping Conversion of MCS/MP2 to MP5 Codes & Compliance - fully implemented for all Business Units Ex-EOTT Administrative personnel trained Training for our personnel on the fully functional systems        I met with Larry this morning and went over transitional issues.

"Rod,  Listed below is one of the items that I have been trying to get a hold of you on.  The others can wait until you have a few minutes.   We have spent some time reviewing the allocation of our VaR and net open position (NOP) trading limits and would like to make the following changes to better match the limits and their objectives to our trading activity and portfolio.  1.  VaR:  Given that we are a naturally short utility and do not hedge our long-dated gas position for regulatory, liquidity and market view reasons we would like to  reallocate $500k of our regulated electric VaR to our regulated natural gas VaR bring the gas VaR up to $2.5MM and reducing the electric VaR to $7.5mm.  This change is necessary to account for the size of our natural short position in the back-end of our reporting period. After reducing our electric VaR we will still have sufficient capacity to manage the regulated electric portfolio.  2. NOP:  After changing our regulated gas VaR to $2.5MM it will be necessary to change the corresponding net open position.  Currently we have been using a 10 Bcf limit for our NOP and Maturity Gap.  Using a $2.5MM VaR we recalculated  the corresponding NOP/Maturity limit to be approximately 17 Bcf.  I have reviewed these changes with Vlady and he has concurred with my proposed changes.  In our conversation he recommended that in addition to reviewing these changes with you that I also run them by Rick Buy.  It was my intent to review these changes with you but I was surprised by having to review these changes with Rick.  It was my understanding that once an allocation of VaR was made to a business unit that it is within the business units preview to reallocate that VaR as needed to met business unit objectives.  If the business process has changed I will be glad to contact Rick and review these changes with him.  Its your call so please let me know your preference.   Thanks.

I have yet another request for which I need your input.  Causey is reviewing his budgets/direct reports, and would like to get the most current headcount numbers for the accounting groups in your business unit(s).    What I mean by accounting groups includes everyone whose superior ultimately reports to Causey.  For instance, this would include the traditional Accounting/Reporting departments, Tax departments, and Transaction Support departments.  It should NOT include any settlements/mid-office groups (for example, Sally Beck's world).  I say ""department"" because I don't want just accountants, but everyone who is in that dept, i.e. admins, clerks, etc.  If you have a question on any unique situation, please just give me a call and we'll discuss.  The data needs to be as recent as possible.  Hopefully, I can get this as of July 31/August 1.  If you have more recent data, that would be great.  At a bare minimum, I need total headcount as described by group (acct, reporting, tax, etc.)  It would also be useful to get as much detail as possible, i.e. by sub-group, by personnel level, etc., but I know that may be a challenge given the timing of the request.    Additionally, if you can provide me with a ""current estimate"" for the groups you report, that would be ideal.  I know that the official CE doesn't go to that level, but I'm betting that most of you have something that projects your G&A by cost center (or group/dept) for 2001, as of the 2nd CE.  The headcount information is a must have, and the 2001 cost estimate is secondary, although I'd like to ask everyone to strive to provide both.  If you can't provide estimated costs for the groups you report, please call me so we can discuss.  Speaking of the timing, I need this by Wednesday, August 29 at 12 noon.

If there is recourse (i.e., the ability to reject inappropriate charges or charges not agreed to), I see fewer potential problems.  Without recourse, it will become a political and reconciliation blackhole.  The best way to handle this is to ask if ENW will assure that their intercompany charges will not be like those currently received from EPSC (Facilities).  The EPSC charges are invariably incorrect, there is no recourse, and Facilities does not act like a service provider.  If it is wrong you not only have to tell them it is wrong but have to tell them who it should have gone to - a real problem since it is debatable that you would know what they are responsible for knowing in order to charge costs out.  Since a large potion of the ENW charges probably follow headcounts, we have to be able to rely on the HR records being accurate as to the placement of people and they are not necessarily accurate at this time.

I have been asked to approve this, but thought on something so broad I should ask if all of you are OK with this.    This would allow direct charges into your assets by a person in networks.    I have been told this can be controlled by entity, so if there is a list of entities this would not be OK for, please let me know.   This is intended to allow Networks to put these intercompany charges directly to your assets.    I understand that that is a common need in the wholesale world.

Because Networks does work for all of Enron, she has a need in her role to transfer dollars between Networks and various other companies.  At this time, the security for the asset accountants is set up by business unit and an accountant can only perform an intercompany transfer within her business unit.   Please approve new security role for the individuals who will need to make intercompany transfers across business units.  This role will be used by the ISC accounting support group also.  We can manage the security so that the individual cannot create master data outside of her own companies and will have to rely on the other company's accountant to set it up for the transfer.  This will effectively eliminate any question of someone transferring value without the knowledge of the receiving company.  Let me know if you have any questions or if I can be of any help.

Subject: Wessex Insurance's  Jim,  Thanks for your e-mail of 8 August informing us that a decision had been made to keep Wessex insurance's under the existing Azurix global programme, or to ultimately absorb the whole of Azurix into an Enron programme.  Whilst we understand this, we are concerned that a continuation of the global policies, at the current cost to Wessex, will raise some regulatory problems for us in the UK.  Our Licence requires us to report trades with parents and associated companies, and to demonstrate that any such trades are undertaken at arms length.  Moreover we are required to periodically test such arrangements. Clearly this has not been done in respect of Insurance.  Even more worrying is the fact that the cost of the Global insurance programme to Wessex is simply not competitive.  The current level of premiums we pay, when added to the much higher excess levels we incur, are in excess of what we could arrange on a standalone basis.  Going forward, if Wessex is to support the rest of the Azurix programme, our costs can only but rise.  In light of these problems we either have to reduce the cost of the Global policies to Wessex or allow Wessex to obtain standalone cover.  Regards.

Part of this exercise will be to look at adding to our disclosure in order to satisfy the  investment community and help them better understand Enron's business. One of the possible items of disclosure is net income on a segment basis. This  would involve the allocation of debt and therefore interest to the segments similar to what we do for ROE and capital charge calculations. Because this  could be reported we are taking a harder look at these allocations as we will need to be able to defend externally.   Although we will not be segmenting based on business units I would like to look at capital structures at the business unit level. This of course will be aggregated  up to the appropriate segment as they are determined. I am currently focusing on an estimated 12/31/2001 balance sheet for allocation purposes. This is our best  guess at what would report at year end. We are using the 7/31/2001 actual balance sheet as a starting point and rolling based on the 2nd current estimate turned in by the business units and adding in any estimated transactions to occur  between now and year end.  I would like to set up meetings with each business unit to discuss their theoretical capital structure and get your ideas sometime EARLY the week of Sept 17. We will try to make a first pass based on each business units ability to service debt and reasonable credit ratios based on comparables. Please take time  to think about this and give me a call to arrange a time to meet. Thanks.  mike d",kathy.campos@enron.com,rod.hayslett@enron.com,FW: Segments,2001-09-14 09:50:36-07:00,sent

Review   Rod, please forward this note to Mark Lindsey ASAP (I can't find his name on our email address book and I've had trouble with sending him things in the past).    Attached is a file that includes unusual accounting adjustments and/or implementation adjustments we're proposing as a result of our new rate case order.  These adjustments total $31.3m (IBIT), and $29.8m (Net Income for Q3 2001.  Forecasted results for Q3 we've been sending to you (including our 3rd Current Estimate) include these adjustments.   Accordingly, not getting AA&Co concurence on any of these issues will have a negative impact on PGG's Q3 results.   For entries affecting PGH & PVC (see tab), we need to make sure Enron Corp is supportive of our treatment.  This is because although AA&Co. Portland will be reviewing our records and our reasons for the adjustments, they will likely pass on the AA&Co. Houston any of these items they may question.  This is because their primary focus is PGE earnings, not PVC or PGH since we don't report these companies out any place publicly on a stand-alone basis.  We've passed along the Merger MOU proposal to AA&Co. Portland already since it has ties to our rate order (and they're thinking about it), but we're waiting to hear back from you that the other three items on the list are support by you, then we'll pass them on to AA&Co Portland for review.  Please respond back by next Monday, Sept 24th to allow us appropriate time to get them reviewed by AA&Co.   All the items on the PGE tab have been explained to AA&Co. Portland, and we're hoping to get their position on these adjustments by next Monday, Sept 24.  We feel we have good justification for all the adjustments, but some are more of a stretch than others (when projecting whether or not AA&Co will approve them).

"FYI  -----Original Message----- From: Stevens, Kirk  Sent: Wednesday, September 19, 2001 11:46 AM To: Mayeux, Gay Cc: Hayslett, Rod Subject: RE: PGE Power Costs   Gay, here's the story and some numbers for the Q3 comparison.  Please remember the context of our phone conversion this morning when looking at this.  Hopefully this helps Investor Relations put the story together for the Earnings Release.  Power Cost Adjustment  We now expect to have an amount collectable from customers to record all Q3 of $86m.  Since we we're basically at the deadband level at the end of Q2, we end up eating our way through the deadband and up into the 90% collection band all in Q3.  On a stand alone basis, we will incur  about $54m of net variable power costs Q3 that we won't have any revenues for (but remember to keep this in context for the entire 9-month period).  The following shows how this is calculated:  Projected Net Variable Power Costs = $316m Baseline for PCA = $176m Difference Subject to PCA Collection = $140  Deadband  = $35m  (no collection) 50/50 band = $21m (collect $10.5m, no collection = $10.5) 90/10 band = $84m (collect $75.5m, no collection = $8.5)  The bands above = $140m ($35+21+84) Collections = $86m ($10.5+75.5) No Collection (PGE eats) = $54m ($35+10.5+8.5)  Again, without the PCA mechanism and no other price increase between 1/1/01 and 9/30/01, PGE would be $90m worse off.  As we discussed, before pulling our request for a rate increase to be effective 1/1/01 (which was replaced with the PCA mechanism), the latest amount being offered up by our PUC would have been around a $90m increase for the 9-month period (although the evidence was quickly moving towards no need for an increase, so we probably wouldn't have got the rate increase, and without a PCA, would have been worse off today).    Quarter to Quarter Comparison - Margins As we discussed, things were looking really good for us through Q2 2001, but price caps and other factors in late Q2/early Q3 really dropped the price we could sell our excess power for, and accordingly has dropped our margins.  In addition, a slowing economy and customer energy efficiency measures have resulted in significant reductions in our retail revenues compared to last year.    Another point on the this year/last year quarter to quarter comparisons is that we went into Q3 2000 with length purchased at fairly low/reasonable costs over the prior year or so.  In Q3 2000, wholesale sales prices increased dramatically (California market) so we made tremendous margins (above normal).  Going into Q3 2001, much of the power we purchased was at higher prices than the previous year because of the higher wholesale power market operating over the past year.  When price caps and other events dropped the bottom out of the wholesale power prices, our margins on our power lenght dropped dramatically.  The PCA only picks up a power of this increase in net variable power costs, as outlined above.  Also remember that we have a regulatory obligation to serve our customers, so we have to go into a month with length in order to ensure we can handle any potential load spikes or unplanned plant outages.  Any excess power is sold in the wholesale market in the day-ahead or real-time markets.    Big story, price caps and lower retail revenues have really hurt us year to year, but our new rate case effective 10/1/01 should get us back on track.   Gross Margin Comparisons Based on our latest forecast, here's a breakdown of our gross margins on a year to year comparison for Q3.  This gives you a high level look at the impact the above events have had on our margins year to year ($94m decrease in gross margin).

The last point is the most important, so we can blow through the preliminaries as fast (or slow) as is appropriate.      1.  Current Status of Proceeding  --Briefing is complete  --minor skirmishing on page limit and Staff motion to strike still going on (argument set for 9-28)    --ALJ decision still expected on or around 10-15  2.  Primary Issues  --TW's tariff and posting procedures are confusing, complex, inconsistent, and allow TW too much discretion  --TW gave Sempra and Richardson unfair advance notice of the capacity availability (preposting conversations)   --TW withheld operational capacity and agreed to make it available only to shippers who agreed to favorable deals with TW  --TW offered negotiated terms and conditions in exchange for the shippers' agreement to pay high rates    --The Sempra and Richardson deals are irrational and must have been the product of market power or unfairness  3.  The Political Climate  --FERC is now coming after PG&E GT NW, on facts that look worse than ours (customers claim they weren't offered the recourse rate).   That case is set for hearing with a decision within 120 days.  Staff raised one new issue:  misuse of alternate delivery point rights.     --Prices continue to abate, with some in California declaring the energy crisis over    4. Likely Litigation Outcome  --Little or no chance of a complete win  --No party proposed refunds or unwinding of the deals as a remedy, but ALJ could recommend it  --No party proposed elimination of TW's negotiated rate authority, but ALJ could recommend it  --Some additional changes in tariff and posting procedures almost certain     --ALJ likely to defer difficult decisions on refunds and negotiated rate policy to the Commission   5.  Settlement Recommendation  --Staff has initiated discussions; ball is in our court to make a specific proposal  --Recommend proposal to Staff that includes some or all of the following points:   *limited moratorium for next heating season on additional index-index contracts on operational capacity    *future operational capacity sales all done through interactive open season   *new posting and capacity allocation procedures in the tariff, with most discretion eliminated     *TW makes many of the tariff and posting changes advocated by Indicated Shippers (i.e., pro rata allocation)    *TW offers to upgrade the EBB to a ""fully interactive, next generation EBB"" as soon as operationally feasible   --TW and Staff will try to get all interested parties on board after general framework nailed down.

The analysis reflects a $305 million charge, or $294 million after tax.  We have assumed asset values that we would place at the 90% confidence level.  These numbers are slightly higher than you saw before as a result of (1)  our taking a 90% confidence level approach and (2) further analysis on Lurgi which reflects an impairment based upon a controlled shut-down alternative rather than a sale.  The numbers also include our recent litigation settlement, Azurix Corp severances, and Azurix Corp PP&E impairments.  We would be available at any time to discuss this analysis with you.  Since AA has not reviewed any of this information, the next step is to get AA to confirm the analysis and numbers.  We will wait on your approval to take this step.

Staff cited constraints in central New York = state and California. Massey asked if the study was to provide solutions or=  recommendations. It is a study to identify the constrained areas and the r= esulting costs to consumers.  RTO FERC is imposing additional ""incentives"" to encourage the formation or join= ing in RTOs. The Midwest, Northeast and Southeast RTOs will be considered a= t a FERC meeting in October. There will be a series of meetings in ""RTO wee= k"" to focus on congestion management, cost recovery, marketing monitoring, = transmission planning, reliability standards and transmission rights. A NOP= R is expected to be issued on market design and structure.  Marketing Affiliate NOPR, RM01-10 The Notice of Propose Rulemaking would apply one set of rules across both n= atural gas pipelines and electric utilities. Under the proposal, transmissi= on providers must operate independently and treat all customers on a nondis= criminatory basis.  The rules would be codified in a new section of the reg= ulations and would broaden the definition of affiliate to include all ""ener= gy affiliates.""  The only exception noted in the discussion was the exclusi= on of Regional Transmission Organizations (RTOs) from the definition of ene= rgy affiliates.   =20  The Commission was presented two options to address the applicability of th= e rule to public utilities' native load merchant functions.     =20  Option A:  Status Quo - the rule would not apply to the bundled retail merc= hant function. Option B:  The rule applies to the bundled retail merchant function and wou= ld prohibit merchant employees from having access to the control room of th= e utility.=20  After extensive discussion, the NOPR was approved 4-0 with additional langu= age added on behalf of Commissioner Breathitt to state that Option B may no= t be included in the final rule and encourage comments by affected parties = and the States.  Massey questioned whether the NOPR is primarily focusing on broadening the = definition of ""energy"" affiliate and whether there are any energy-type affi= liates that would be exempt. Staff responded that the emphasis is on broade= ning the definition to include all ""energy affiliates"" and no energy-type m= arketing affiliates would be exempt, except RTO's.  The proposed rule extents the current prohibition against disclosing certai= n information to all ""energy affiliates"".  The rules do not directly govern=  energy affiliates, but they govern the disclosure of information and the s= eparation of transmission employees, officers and directors from other busi= nesses.=20  Under the proposal, waivers may be requested, if operationally required or = under emergency protocols particularly for small systems.

"FYI  -----Original Message----- From: Stevens, Kirk  Sent: Monday, October 01, 2001 2:45 PM To: Butts, Bob; Hayslett, Rod Cc: Piro, Jim Subject: PGG Q3 Forecast - Confidential    Quick update on our Q3 earnings (still very prelim).  3rd Current Estimate:        IBIT = (2.7)        NI    = (1.3)  Latest Forecast:        IBIT = (9.1)        NI   = 1.7  Major variance - TOLI loss for the month is expected to be $9.5m, or $6.5m worse than our 3rd Current Estimate.  The recent sharp decline in the stock market is the driver (post Sept 11 market impact). Without the additional TOLI loss, we'd be right on our 3rd Current Estimate.  Major Risks - AA&Co. Issues The following issues are currently being reviewed and challenged (to different degrees) by AA&Co Portland (note- Houston AA&Co - Duncan -has been updated on these items by Tim McCann - AA&Co Portland).  Our forecast numbers above assume positive outcome on all these issues.  We will continue to hold our ground, feeling our positions are appropriate.  But since several of these have no direct impact on PGE stand-alone reporting, Houston (you) have better leverage getting these through the AA&Co staff in Houston that may question our treatment.  TOLI Deferred Tax Reserve - $9m PGE proposes to reverse this reserve established Q4 1999 (at the date of the Sierra Sale announcement) since the deal with Sierra was terminated, and since we now feel recording this type of reserve is more appropriate at the time of an actual transfer of the TOLI assets to Enron under any future sale of PGE.  AA&Co is fighting this one hard, Greek Rice has been made aware of this.  Pension Credit Capitalization - $5m (YTD 9/30 true-up) PGE proposes that we no longer capitalize our FAS 87 pension credit since our rates assume zero pension costs for ratemaking purposes.  AA&Co. is using a FAS 87 implementation issue to say we still need to capitalize the credit, and possibly set up a FAS 71 reg asset (although they're still somewhat pushing no change to our current accounting, ie just keep capitalizing the pension credit).  Merger MOU Obligation - PVC - $5.7m Since our new ratecase allows recovery of the remaining costs for this committment made as part of the Enron purchase of PGE, we believe the remaining liability set up in purchase accounting on PVC's books can be reversed.  AA&Co. feels we still have an obligation to perform the MOU committments (which we do), but we feel that our original estimate of this cost at the time of the PGE/Enron merger has now been reduced as a result of the ratemaking treatment, so it should be reduced to zero.  AA&Co. prefers that we bring the liability down over time as we fullfill the committment, letting earnings effect come in over time.  Severance Reserves - PGH1 ($2.7m) and PVC ($3.5m) At the time of the Enron purchase of PGE, severance reserves were set up for an anticipate number of involuntary terminations expected to occur within the first few years of the merger.  Over time, actual severance payments made to PGH or PGE employees have been reversed out of these reserves.  At this point, no future terminations are contemplated which relate to the initial merger conditions/environment.  Accordingly we plan to reverse these balances to income Q3.    At this point, AA&Co. thinks we should consider taking these back against goodwill (which we feel goes against Purchase Accounting guidance).    Litigation Reserve - PGH1 ($2.1m) PGC and it's subsidiaries had numerous legal issues outstanding at the merger date (eg. Columbia Steel, Trojan Recovery, City of Burbank Contract, Bonneville Pacific).   A reserve of $5 million was established in purchase accounting for any legal/litigation and settlement costs incurred by PGC and subsidiaries to defend itself in these types of claims/proceedings.  The reserve also was to cover any litigation filed post merger directly related to the merger.  Since the merger date, we have reversed actual costs incurred for these types of activities in the amount of $2.9 million, leaving a remaining reserve balance at 9/30/01 of $2.1 million.  At this time, all legal claims outstanding at the merger date have been settled satisfactorily where no material contingency exists.    Accordingly, we will reverse the remaining balance in Q3 2001.  Again, AA&Co has indicated that we had over estimated the original cost of these activities in purchase accounting, and that we should now reverse the difference back through goodwill (again, we think this is a misapplication of purchase accounting since we are well outside the orginal 1-2 year window for adjusting goodwill).   There are a few other items we're debating with AA&Co (in the range of $4m to 6m), and I'll let you know if any of these start to look at risk.    Let me know if you have any questions on these items (503) 464-7121.",tracy.geaccone@enron.com,rod.hayslett@enron.com,FW: PGG Q3 Forecast - Confidential,2001-10-01 15:15:22-07:00,sent

Subject: REQUEST - 2001 Operating Expenses - High Priority  Hello everyone.  I know that most, if not all, of you are busy with quarter close, 2002 Plan, and possibly Board of Directors presentations and that this is not the ideal time to have more added to your plate.  However, in conjunction to with setting the 2002 Plan targets, the Office of the Chairman has asked to see an analysis of 2001 operating expenses by business unit, with some level of detail, and with quick turnaround.  To that end, and to expedite this request in an efficient manner (and hopefuly save you some work), corporate accounting has already prepared a summary of operating expenses by business unit by category for the eight months ended August 31, 2001.  These categories correlate very closely with the most often used accounts in SAP (cost element groups), i.e. salaries, benefits, outside services, etc.  This information ties to your rollup in CS.  Some categories have many accounts mapped to them, and we have provided the mapping employed by corporate for you to follow (column AO).  What we are asking you to do is as follows:  1. Review the attached schedule for the eight months ended 8/31/2001 (first sheet - Expenses-YTD August 2001).  Corporate has highlighted, in yellow, various amounts that warrant some additional explanation.  Please provide an explanation for these highlighted amounts.  You may do so in any format you choose (at the bottom with a footnote, additional schedule, etc.).  2. As you may remember doing earlier this year with the 2001 Plan, please take your total expenses YTD 8/31/01 and categorize them by function.  We have provided a list of the most common functions in this file, but if you need to add functions for clarity, please do so.  Corporate gave thought to using the SAP alternate hierarchies to do this, but concluded that each BU should have input on this as you will know the most appropriate hierarchies to use and any other adjustments to make, if needed.  3. Considering what has been incurred through August and what the remainder of the year holds for your BU, please project your total 2001 operating expenses by both category and by function.  Please fill in the second sheet in the file (Expenses-Sep-Dec 2001) with your projections and review the totals sheet (Total Year Estimate).    Keep in mind that this exercise is meant to be your best estimate at this time of these items, given the quick turnaround time, and not an exhaustive project. We realize that this is the best estimate at this time and understand that these numbers may change for a variety of reasons.  If you have any questions, please call me at x33341 or Terry West at x36910.  And finally, this needs to be completed and returned to me by 1:00pm this Wednesday, October 3.

We are providing a level of detail for expense and capital spend that is greater than that provided in past years, and that will allow business units to make informed choices regarding the services that they receive.    We are meeting with individual business unit Offices of the Chair to review in detail the four service areas delivered through Enron Net Works.  Some of these meetings have been completed and more will occur between now and October 12.  Please keep the following points in mind as we work with you to finalize budget:  Enron Networks today is very different from this time last year.  Additions to the 2002 ENW budget are Operations for EA, EIM and EGM.  Operations, IT Maintenance and Development, and IT Infrastructure for EES and EBS have been included under the ENW umbrella for the first time in the  2002  budget as well.  The 2001 budgets for these functions were approved and included in individual business units last year.   Any comparison of ENW's 2002 versus 2001 budget must be appropriately adjusted for these organizational changes to be relevant.    For further detail for each business unit, ENW's 2002 expense and capital dollars are organized to mirror each business unit's lines of business (products or commodities) in order to create a transparent view at a more granular level of the costs involved in supporting each of the lines of business.    The detail that is being provided to business units for IT costs delineates licensing fees, system maintenance costs and new development costs.  Detail on each IT development project identifies the purpose, business sponsor, line of business, ""in progress"" or ""planned"" designation, expense and capital spend, system impacted, and estimated completion date.   In order to finalize IT project budgets, decisions will be required from the business units on which projects to undertake in 2002.

"Rod-  This seems to be a reasonable approach although we have not done this before (so my experience base is a bit limited).  I assume the heavy involvement of CRM assures that we, collectively, are looking at this fairly and has the added benefit of assuring CRM's buy-in if the outside price is cheaper.  I know that Wessex could do the analysis on their own, but I believe Jim and CRM should be involved to achieve the above benefits.    Rod, I am happy with your sending this message out to the Wessex team, copying me on the email.        Rod Hayslett/ENRON@enronXgate 10/12/01 06:47 AM     To: Michael Anderson/HOU/AZURIX@AZURIX  cc: James L Bouillion/ENRON@enronXgate  Subject: Insurance Issues     What do you think of the following proposal to get this process off and running?   I would propose sending this to the 2 of you and Keith as well as Beverly Markham and Mark Watts.    It can come from me or from you?     Your choice.      After the budget session last week, I thought I needed to make sure one more process is started and in order.     Insurance costs have risen and there is a  disconnect between expectations and actual results.    I would like to think that we can develop the proper insurance program for Wessex and other Operating  Companies in a short time.       I think we will need to determine what levels of insurance and deductibles are needed and then what is the right information to send out in the request for quotes.    This is so that everyone is dealing with the same information.     I would argue that we should be able to price the deal in the market and then give the group program  a right to match the deal.    I think the next step is yours, to tell us what levels of insurance and deductibles are needed  and then follow that up with the information  to go out in the RFP.   However, it will be necessary to establish some ground rules.     In the event the Operating Company (OC) wishes  to secure a ""market price"" for their insurance:  1. The OC may nominate a broker to secure pricing.  The Broker is subject to CRM's (Corporate Risk Management working for EGS-Enron Global Services)  approval.  Such approval will not be unreasonably withheld.   An appeal of an adverse decision from CRM to the CEO of EGS is possible.  2. CRM will specify and the operating company will supply to CRM,  the necessary underwriting information.  3. The OC will specify the types of insurance and coverages,  limits, and deductibles they require for their business.  4. CRM will provide the underwriting data and coverage specifications to the competing brokers.  5. The competing brokers will be directed by and report to CRM during the bid process and thereafter, if the broker is appointed.  6. CRM will receive the proposals from the brokers, evaluate and report the results, with recommendations, to the operating company and the appropriate senior  manager within Enron.  7. OC will elect the program and price they  prefer and CRM will have the right to provide such coverage or direct the appropriate broker in the placement of a  separate program.  8. For locations outside the U.S. the OC may request using their nominated broker for servicing their day to day insurance needs, provided the broker becomes  a ""correspondent"" within the established Enron Broker Network.  This will ensure continued co-ordination of the insurance programs.   I think a progam like this can get everyone closer to a satisfactory conclusion in the process.     Please let me know your thoughts on the proposed program,  because obviously we need to get started ASAP.

"See comments below.   -----Original Message----- From:  Ratner, Michael   Sent: Sunday, October 14, 2001 11:50 AM To: Hayslett, Rod; Soldano, Louis Cc: Nelson, Kimberly (ETS); Chavez, Gabriel; Strader, Kelly Subject: Up coming events and issues.  There are a few events coming up that I thought you should know about as a couple of them will require decisions as they expand what we are looking at doing:  The NALMP has been invited to submit comments to and potential meet with Rod Paige, Sec. of Education, regarding the state of Native American education.  Mary Munson has asked if we would like to participate as one of their donors.  She is asking for a couple of paragraphs about why and how Enron's contributions started, and possibly someone to attend the meeting if it happens.  Is this something we would be willing to put our name on?  I think it would be very helpful to the cause.       Steve: Although I see no reason not to do so, I thought I should make sure you would have no problem with this idea.  Along similar lines, there is a legislative initiative in Congress to allow companies that donate in-kind contributions, such as shipping, to non-profits to take a tax deduction.  I have not seen the language of the proposed legislation, but it supposedly has a wide base of support from non-profits.  Apparently, our willingness to donate shipping is highly unusual.  What do we want to do about this?  Steve/Greek:  I assume Enron is supportive of such a measure, but is there something else we can do?  On Dec. 13, there will be a ceremony at the Kayenta Boys & Girls Club honoring them as the 200th B&G Club in Indian country and the 3,000th overall (I think?).  We have donated a couple of computers there and will donate about five more before the event.  Kayenta, which is pretty isolated, is the area where Black Mesa is near.  Sen. John McCain is scheduled to attend.  Please let me know if either of you are interested in going.

"  After the budget session, I thought I needed to make sure one more process is started and in order.     Insurance costs have risen and there may be a disconnect between expectations and actual results.    I would like to think that we can develop the proper insurance program for Wessex and other Operating Companies in a short time.       I think we will need to determine what levels of insurance and deductibles are needed and then what is the right information to send out in the request for quotes.    This is so that everyone is dealing with the same information.     I would argue that we should be able to price the deal in the market and then give the group program  a right to match the deal.    I think the next step is yours, to tell us what levels of insurance and deductibles are needed  and then follow that up with the information  to go out in the RFP.   However, it will be necessary to establish some ground rules.     In the event the Operating Company (OC) wishes  to secure a ""market price"" for their insurance:  1. The OC may nominate a broker to secure pricing.  The Broker is subject to CRM's (Corporate Risk Management working for EGS-Enron Global Services)  approval.  Such approval will not be unreasonably withheld.   An appeal of an adverse decision from CRM to the CEO of EGS is possible.  2. CRM will specify and the operating company will supply to CRM,  the necessary underwriting information.  3. The OC will specify the types of insurance and coverages,  limits, and deductibles they require for their business.  4. CRM will provide the underwriting data and coverage specifications to the competing brokers.  5. The competing brokers will be directed by and report to CRM during the bid process and thereafter, if the broker is appointed.  6. CRM will receive the proposals from the brokers, evaluate and report the results, with recommendations, to the operating company and the appropriate senior  manager within Enron.  7. OC will elect the program and price they  prefer and CRM will have the right to provide such coverage or direct the appropriate broker in the placement of a  separate program.  8. For locations outside the U.S. the OC may request using their nominated broker for servicing their day to day insurance needs, provided the broker becomes  a ""correspondent"" within the established Enron Broker Network.  This will ensure continued co-ordination of the insurance programs.   I think a progam like this can get everyone closer to a satisfactory conclusion in the process.     Please let me know your thoughts on the proposed program,  because obviously we need to get started ASAP.

I pass   it along, for your information.    WHAT TO DO IF YOU LOSE YOUR PURSE OR WALLET    We've all heard horror stories about fraud that's committed using your  name,   address, SS#, credit, etc. Unfortunately I (the author of this piece  who   happens to be an attorney) have firsthand knowledge, because my wallet  was   stolen last month and within a week the thieve(s) ordered an expensive   monthly cell phone package, applied for a VISA credit card,   had a credit line approved to buy a Gateway computer, received a PIN  number   from DMV to change my driving record information online, and more.    But here's some critical information to limit the damage in case this   happens to you or someone you know. As everyone always advises, cancel  your   credit cards immediately, but the key is having the toll free numbers  and   your card numbers handy so you know whom to call.   Keep those where you can find them easily. File a police report  immediately   in the jurisdiction where it was stolen, this proves to credit  providers you   were diligent, and is a first step toward an investigation (if there  ever is   one).    But here's what is perhaps most important: (I never ever thought to do   this). Call the three national credit reporting organizations  immediately   to place a fraud alert on your name and SS#. I had never heard of  doing   that until advised by a bank that called to tell me an application for   credit was made over the Internet in my name. The alert means any  company   that checks your credit knows your information was stolen and they have  to   contact you by phone to authorize new credit. By the time I was  advised to   do this, almost 2 weeks after the theft, all the damage had been done.    There are records of all the credit checks initiated by the thieves'   purchases, none of which I knew about before placing the alert. Since  then,   no additional damage has been done, and the thieves threw my wallet  away   this weekend (someone turned it in). It seems to have stopped them in  their  tracks.    The numbers are:   Equifax: 1-800-525-6285   Experian (formerly TRW): 1-888-397-3742   Trans Union: 1-800-680-7289   Social Security Administration (fraud line): 1-800-269-0271    We pass along jokes; we pass along just about everything. Do think   about passing this information along. It could really help someone.

" On tuesday of this week after EOTT's staff meeting, I was made aware of a potential environmental estimate problem (too big).    I am looking at ways of potentially dealing with the problem so that Lawrence will feel comfortable not booking a reserve in the 3rd qtr, which may have consequences on the plans we have underway to recapitalize the entity.   This means coming up with an answer very quickly.   There are a number of potential alternatives and I am sure there are more than I will attempt to lay out here.  1) We could simply make a contribution to EOTT for the sole purpose of environmental cleanup, and if unused will be returned.   Seems like an expense item, but doable.  2) We could provide an insurance policy to EOTT to provide for environmental expenses in excess of the existing policy, for a fee.    Better expense treatment (we get to manage the reserve) and appears to cover the EOTT issue.   Because this is an affiliated deal, I guess it would have to go through the audit committee.   Potentially the captive could be used.  3) Provide an accounting answer that might give EOTT a one-time gain to offset the one time reserve set-up.   i.e., there is a least an argument that the recapitalization proposed will result in the extinguishment of a portion of the debt on the books represented by the API's.     Since we are getting a conversion of less than a dollar for dollar deal, this should be doable.  For Lawrence:  Jim Bouillion has indicated that the insurance proposal may have merit, and so I will need some input from you regarding the coverage that exists now and what we would want going forward.    If you want us to talk directly with Susan, we will.   I am thinking that you are getting a quote for increasing the cap on the existing policy and that we could give you the same deal, or maybe even slightly better, to satisfy the audit committee.    I am obviously looking for any help that I can get here, so if there any more ideas I would like to hear them.    If you have questions, feel free to ask.

EAMR, as you are probably aware, is an affiliate of Enron Transportation Services Company that performs services for third parties as well as other Enron affiliate companies.   When EAMR enters into a contract with non Enron customers to deliver services, EAMR assumes all of the risk for any losses in the transaction  Additionally, EAMR is not to be supported financially by the affiliated pipelines.  All costs such as employee payroll expenses, travel and other related employee expenses, equipment usage fees, etc  associated with an employee performing services for a customer under an EAMR transaction must be accurately recorded pursuant to prudent accounting procedures.   Going forward,  to ensure that there are no financial or contractual obligations that are not in the best interest of EAMR, the following process will be used on all transactions.  1) Cost estimates for services through EAMR will be sent to Sarabeth Smith in Houston for review and approval.  Sarabeth will ensure that all costs and appropriate margins are included in the cost structure and then release it through a non-binding agreement for presentation to the customer by appropriate marketing personnel.  Cost estimates, given to customers outside of this step in the process, run the possibility of having to be retracted due to the risk of committing EAMR to a transaction that is not contractually or financially sound.  2) It is the responsibility of every employee performing services for EAMR to be diligent in recording their time and expenses required to perform the services to the appropriately assigned project number.  Monthly reviews of the expenses associated with each project will be conducted to ensure that all costs have been accurately recorded.

The complaint asked FERC to find SoCalGas' refusal to pay the tariff commodity rate constitutes a violation of Transwestern's tariff and the 1995 Global Settlement.  SoCalGas filed an Answer on October 18, 2001.  In summary, SoCalGas' Answer stated:  1. SoCalGas did not affirmatively agree to pay the stated tariff rate during the Global Settlement.    2. The commodity charge SoCal has been paying is consistent with the course of performance/conduct prior to, and after, the Global Settlement.    3. Since the Global Settlement has been in effect, SoCalGas has relied on the commodity/usage charges that Transwestern has billed.      4. SoCalGas claims they had been paying the appropriate rate and that Transwestern failed to include the correct rate in its tariff; such omission has created ambiguity and any ambiguity should be construed against the drafter of the tariff, Transwestern.  5. If the Commission disagrees with SoCalGas and declines to reject the complaint outright, any retroactive billing adjustment should be limited to a six-month period.  6. SoCalGas admits that a retroactive billing adjustment for the escalation factor for six months is reasonable and an escalation factor going forward for the remaining term of its Contract No. 8255 is appropriate.  In addition to the foregoing statements, SoCalGas provided that it, like Transwestern, was interested in resolving this matter through ADR.  Accordingly, we will be coordinating with SoCalGas and FERC's ADR group to explore possible ADR procedures.  We will advise as new developments warrant.  In the meantime, should you have any questions regarding this matter please do not hesitate to contact me at (402) 398-7406 or Maria Pavlou at (402) 398-7097.",tracy.geaccone@enron.com,rod.hayslett@enron.com,FW: SoCalGas Complaint (Message from Greg Porter),2001-10-23 05:20:29-07:00,sent

In reality, prices have risen and shippers have shorted the system by 1.7 Bcf month-to-date.  Our original plan, based on a combination of physical requirements and regulatory strategy was as follows:  Ending October Balance  12 Bcf Ending November Balance  13 Bcf Ending December Balance  14 Bcf  To acheive this plan we are projecting a purchase in November of at least 2.5 Bcf (depending upon shipper short gas over the remainder of the month).  We also expect to receive 0.3 Bcf of SBA imbalance payback in November that should raise the operational storage levels to approximately 13 Bcf.  We are still at risk for over-filling our storage fields in November and do not wish to buy any volumes that might push us over the 13 Bcf operational storage level.  Therefore, we are targeting the purchase of 2.5 Bcf of gas (which may be adjusted based on the customer's imbalances over the next week) for November.

I am of the opinion that the dedication of a talented Global Finance professional will provide us with a much better work product (service) at a significantly lower cost, if we can get EGF to allocate 100% of the cost of the employee and eliminate their allocation to us entirely.  I would like to suggest that you consider Dan Castagnola as the dedicated resource.  Not only is Dan very familiar with all or a majority of our projects from both the commercial as well as the finance perspective, but in my experience working with him, he is an extremely creative and talented business person.  I would feel very fortunate to have Dan on my team.  Just a recommendation ...   Thanks, Mariella  ps: Jeff has worked with Dan so he can also give you his independent perspective.",mariella.mahan@enron.com,rod.hayslett@enron.com,RE: Finance Support,2001-10-23 05:49:07-07:00,sent

Sent: Tuesday, October 23, 2001 12:36 PM To: Horton, Stanley Cc: Hayslett, Rod Subject: Quick Note  Stan,  Knowing that your schedule is tight, I wanted to drop you a not on two items;  1) I have had a couple discussions with Rod on the finance/accounting organization for Wind.  I understand that Adam is pushing for a new full-time CFO including a CFO for Europe.  Being open, Adam and I have different views on the direction of the organization.  My view is that many functions should be supported by the Enron infrastructure (including treasury, cash-management, insurance, IT, etc.).  Adam would prefer to stay autonomous and is attempting to direct initiatives to that end.  I continue to push the organization in the course that I believe makes most sense.  While we are both professionals, this situation does create a conflict.  In my opinion, the most serious issues in this business are not financial, they are operational and commercial.  I'll continue to work with Rod, but would be glad to discuss with you in further detail.  2) I understand that Steve Hotte is transferring to Wholesale and you are looking at several candidates.  I would like to offer you input on two candidates that I have had considerable experience with.  Both are worthy of serious consideration, and both capable of meeting your needs.  Everett Plante - I recruited Everett into Enron from a fairly high position at Compaq.  Initially he was in Enron International.  After the dissolution of EI he rolled into corporate for a short time, subsequently, I helped get him moved into EBS.  He was thought of very highly.  He has great organization skill and a practical view on technology.  He has been through several organizations since coming to Enron and he has adeptly dealt with change.  Andrew Parsons - Andrew has worked for me on Y2K and in his current role in IT Compliance.  Andrew has great interpersonal and teamwork skills.  He is very focused and goal oriented.  Andrew is currently a Sr. Director, but will be up for VP at yearend.  While not as experienced as Everett, Andrew has a lot of potential.  I know that Causey also thinks highly of Andrew.

This particularly affects the desk, which is very nice but drawerless and designed to work together with the wall unit that sits behind it.

We think, those discussions have pointed to a need to assess inefficiencies that appear to exist related to data integrity as data moves between systems and users that span the entire gas volume/quality collection, transformation and delivery process.  In other words there seem to be too many questions and reconcilliations that people have to address along the process as data changes hands and is used for different internal and external purposes.  There also appears to be a lack of a single point of responsibility in the organization for gas volume data from start to finish. The PGAS reporting project proposed to assess this at a high level and make some recommendations.  But as important as the issue appears to be, you might want to consider using Rutherford to help ETS do a more thorough job of this. This effort would extend outside FA&A.

We think, those discussions have pointed to a need to assess inefficiencies that appear to exist related to data integrity as data moves between systems and users that span the entire gas volume/quality collection, transformation and delivery process.  In other words there seem to be too many questions and reconcilliations that people have to address along the process as data changes hands and is used for different internal and external purposes.  There also appears to be a lack of a single point of responsibility in the organization for gas volume data from start to finish. The PGAS reporting project proposed to assess this at a high level and make some recommendations.

I am of the opinion that the dedication of a talented Global Finance professional will provide us with a much better work product (service) at a significantly lower cost, if we can get EGF to allocate 100% of the cost of the employee and eliminate their allocation to us entirely.  I would like to suggest that you consider Dan Castagnola as the dedicated resource.  Not only is Dan very familiar with all or a majority of our projects from both the commercial as well as the finance perspective, but in my experience working with him, he is an extremely creative and talented business person.  I would feel very fortunate to have Dan on my team.  Just a recommendation ...

In addition to the table that we buy annually, we are also giving Houston Ballet $15,000.

We will use 260 tickets for children involved with area non-profits, who might not have an opportunity to otherwise experience the Nutcracker.  The other 40 will be used for Enron employees who will volunteer to chaperone the children.  At noon of that day, we will have a pizza party at the Wortham with many of the Nutcracker characters walking around, meeting the children and reading to them.  Since you are involved with the ballet, we thought we'd see if you'd like to ask your team if they would like to be the volunteers.  Spouses and children (older than 14) are welcome to help, too!

"  Per your request,  Attached is the slide we reviewed with Danny today.  It shows the value of contract terminations for NNG for the contract year of 1101/03 to 11/01/04 to be $145 million. It also shows that the estimated market value is $95 million.  I think for planning purposes however, we would assume that we would contract for the full value of $145 million either through better pricing analytics, new business development projects and/ or Rate Case reallocation to captive customers.  The biggest risk would be the South end TFF of $12 million which we would have a hard time replacing at a $3 million level.        So, depending on your assumptions, 2003 and 2004 could be flat to 2002 margin of $439.1 million -   or, if you take into account  the TFF deterioration, it could be below by $8 to 10 million.  However, this deterioration will be offset by some of the new power plant projects  - in particular ""Pleasant Hill""  which will bring an incremental $6 million in 2004.  I think you also have to assume that other business development projects will come in to help offset the downsides.  Sorry if I rambled a bit too much.  My view is that NNG will have margin targets for planning purposes flat with 2002.    Call me if you wish to discuss.

We closed a commercial paper conduit receivables securitization transaction program last quarter and are looking to close a second receivables transaction (most likely a privately placed term loan facility) by mid-November.  Towards that goal, we are investigating the receivables and payables position of all Enron entities.  We would like to enlist your team's assistance in better understanding ETS's receivables and payables position and how that data is generated and processed.  To better understand our project and data request, I have attached presentations and due diligence questions from the mandated banks' proposals to Enron.  Although all requested details are not needed immediately, what is urgent at bare minimum is net receivable balance, aging and roll forward for September and October.  We are scheduled to meet with banks tomorrow to discuss opportunities.  Any and all assistance and guidance is much appreciated.  Based on our prior experience, we understand the process of gathering and processing data may be time consuming.  However, I'd like to note that the other business unit teams assembled thus far are available to share their insights, techniques, and expertise.  We will do our best to provide you any assistance you may need in fulfilling our request.

I do not feel that changing a reporting relationship would correct any problems.    I feel the time and effort can e better spent improving our current data collect process and data flow between SCADA and PGAS.  While this process is working I feel that it requires to much manual intervention and handling.  The IT department, Measurement Technology, Gas Control Hot Seat, and the Data Analysis are all involved in keeping the data flowing between SCADA and PGAS.  We should step back and re look and the current process and see what improvements can be made to better control and maintain this process.   A second area that should be looked at is the data validation process.  Currently Field Operations, Data Analysis, and GMS all  manually review measurement data.  With all of the computer and software technology available I feel that we could easily automate most of the current manual data validation.  I have limited experience with the Rutherford company and what they could provide towards improving these items.

We think, those discussions have pointed to a need to assess inefficiencies that appear to exist related to data integrity as data moves between systems and users that span the entire gas volume/quality collection, transformation and delivery process.  In other words there seem to be too many questions and reconcilliations that people have to address along the process as data changes hands and is used for different internal and external purposes.  There also appears to be a lack of a single point of responsibility in the organization for gas volume data from start to finish. The PGAS reporting project proposed to assess this at a high level and make some recommendations.  But as important as the issue appears to be, you might want to consider using Rutherford to help ETS do a more thorough job of this. This effort would extend outside FA&A.

Additionally, we discussed some sites that would provide a variety of things to see.  Below is a possible schedule he sent me.   What we would provide is a Certificates 101 training and answer questions (1 1/2 Hours), Steve Kirk's group would provide a rates and tariff 101 session that would take a full 2 hours or maybe more, and Tim Kissner would provide a cost of service presentation (how he arrives at a cost of service).  Tim's presentation takes another 1 1/2 hours.  This would take up one day.  Then I could provide the names or help you set up tours of the Redfield Underground storage, a tour of the Ogden compressor station, A tour of the Garner LNG, and possibly a tour of the Farmington Compressor station.  The Ogden station does not have turbine horsepower or electric driven units, but is a major compressor station on our system.  This would take most of two days to cover.    I mentioned this idea to Eric and Steve and they are both very interested.  Also, Tony Pryor was there and he said Drew would be interested, and I got an e-mail from Nancy Bagot in the DC office wanting to participate.

When I was in Calgary, Keith Petersen and I were talking about rates and certificates and he mentioned some seminars that the Omaha people do.  Additionally, we discussed some sites that would provide a variety of things to see.  Below is a possible schedule he sent me.   What we would provide is a Certificates 101 training and answer questions (1 1/2 Hours), Steve Kirk's group would provide a rates and tariff 101 session that would take a full 2 hours or maybe more, and Tim Kissner would provide a cost of service presentation (how he arrives at a cost of service).  Tim's presentation takes another 1 1/2 hours.  This would take up one day.  Then I could provide the names or help you set up tours of the Redfield Underground storage, a tour of the Ogden compressor station, A tour of the Garner LNG, and possibly a tour of the Farmington Compressor station.  The Ogden station does not have turbine horsepower or electric driven units, but is a major compressor station on our system.  This would take most of two days to cover.    I mentioned this idea to Eric and Steve and they are both very interested.  Also, Tony Pryor was there and he said Drew would be interested, and I got an e-mail from Nancy Bagot in the DC office wanting to participate.  I realize this could become a lot of people, but it could be a good opportunity for some practical experience and team building.  What do you think?

Right now the Phantom Units under the Plan are valued based upon a general partner distribution rate divided by the distribution yield, which depending upon what assumptions are used, makes these phantom units quite expensive. It was decided that the grants should be based upon the Common Unit price and not the general partner valuation. I am not sure of the breakdown of employees per NP and NBP that have elected to defer bonuses into this Plan to date. Benefits have asked that we have the changes put into place by Friday in order to incorporate them into the year-end deferral package offered to employees.

Please forward this on to Clint Walden, Rick Causey and Rod Hayslett (and anyone else you think needs this information)  I have a couple of comments on the conditions below that were discussed on the phone but were not included in the list below.  We would expect a representation from the Board as well as outside legal counsel on point #4 below.  Also, I assume this review is a condition precedent in the debt documents.  Enron should be aware that there may be issues that arise that do not allow us to complete our work in the timetable necessary and should consider whether wording the loan documents relating to this cp should be modified to describe the review as something that is a condition precendent ""if it is professionally able to be completed.""   Also, all of these conditions assume there are no financial obligations from the entities in the reviews from or to Enron corp.  If so, those contractual relationships will need to be evaluted to determine if ""overhang"" issues combined with the financial obligations might preclude us from completing our review.   This is a high priority item.  I would ask that the company assist us in immediately identifying and evaluating those financial obligations, if any,  to determine if significant issues exist.  We can get started now on that. Please call Heather Mueck and Chris Herbold.  I would like to get that identification work completed by end of business tomorrow.  Heather and Gerrad will be leading the review work and Chris will be assisting also.  Overall debt questions.  We need to understand terms, conditions and debt documents.  Who has these? We are ready to start reviewing today.  Financial statements and review work. What periods are going to be included in the documents? The comment below says quarterly.  Which quarters? Year-to-date? Comparison to prior years? We would expect a full set of financial statements with footnotes for all periods presented (balance sheets, income statements and cash flows?   Who is drafting the footnote that describes the overhang issues? This is a high priority item that will get much review and scrutiny. l would like to get the Company's signed off footnote disclosure on the ""overhang"" issues tomorrow.  Also, we will need immediate access to the financials and your people to answer questions. When can we get the financials that will be included in the deal.  I assume Enron personnel will be available to answer questions 24/7 beginning today to complete this work in the necessary timeframe?  I know these are many questions.  More to come I am sure.

We presently have a guaranty from Transcanada Pipelines in support of TEFP, however it will have to be increased to cover the transaction.

Subject:  RE: Initial Decision of ALJ in TW Negotiated Rates              Proceeding        I very much agree with the below and the reason for establishing the      reserve, however, given the positive order from the ALJ is this a type      I or      type II subsequent event (one requires adjustment to the financial      statements and one that does not).  I realize the FERC still needs to      approve, however I think that the ""heat"" as described below has cooled      down      and a recommendation from the ALJ to the FERC would be viewed as a      positive      thing causing the need to reverse the reserve.  (see below literature      from      SAS 12).         .02 Two types of subsequent events require consideration by management      and      evaluation by the independent auditor.       .03 The first type consists of those events that provide additional      evidence with respect to conditions that existed at the date of the      balance      sheet and affect the estimates inherent in the process of preparing      financial statements. All information that becomes available prior to      the      issuance of the financial statements should be used by management in      its      evaluation of the conditions on which the estimates were based. The      financial statements should be adjusted for any changes in estimates      resulting from the use of such evidence.       .04 Identifying events that require adjustment of the financial      statements      under the criteria stated above calls for the exercise of judgment and      knowledge of the facts and circumstances. For example, a loss on an      uncollectible trade account receivable as a result of a customer's      deteriorating financial condition leading to bankruptcy subsequent to      the      balance-sheet date would be indicative of conditions existing at the      balance-sheet date, thereby calling for adjustment of the financial      statements before their issuance. On the other hand, a similar loss      resulting from a customer's major casualty such as a fire or flood      subsequent to the balance-sheet date would not be indicative of      conditions      existing at the balance-sheet date and adjustment of the financial      statements would not be appropriate. The settlement of litigation for      an      amount different from the liability recorded in the accounts would      require      adjustment of the financial statements if the events, such as personal      injury or patent infringement, that gave rise to the litigation had      taken      place prior to the balance-sheet date.       .05 The second type consists of those events that provide evidence      with      respect to conditions that did not exist at the date of the balance      sheet      being reported on but arose subsequent to that date. These events      should      not result in adjustment of the financial statements.(superscript: 1)      Some      of these events, however, may be of such a nature that disclosure of      them      is required to keep the financial statements from being misleading.      Occasionally such an event may be so significant that disclosure can      best      be made by supplementing the historical financial statements with pro      forma      financial data giving effect to the event as if it had occurred on the      date      of the balance sheet. It may be desirable to present pro forma      statements,      usually a balance sheet only, in columnar form on the face of the      historical statements.            (superscript: 1.)This paragraph is not intended to preclude      giving           effect in the balance sheet, with appropriate disclosure, to      stock           dividends or stock splits or reverse splits consummated after the           balance-sheet date but before issuance of the financial      statements.       .06 Examples of events of the second type that require disclosure to      the      financial statements (but should not result in adjustment) are:          a.      Sale of a bond or capital stock issue.          b.      Purchase of a business.          c.      Settlement of litigation when the event giving rise to the      claim           took place subsequent to the balance-sheet date.          d.      Loss of plant or inventories as a result of fire or flood.          e.      Losses on receivables resulting from conditions (such as a           customer's major casualty) arising subsequent to the      balance-sheet           date.       .07 Subsequent events affecting the realization of assets such as      receivables and inventories or the settlement of estimated liabilities      ordinarily will require adjustment of the financial statements (see      paragraph .03 (Document link: P/AU560.03/AUPROSTD)) because such      events      typically represent the culmination of conditions that existed over a      relatively long period of time. Subsequent events such as changes in      the      quoted market prices of securities ordinarily should not result in      adjustment of the financial statements (see paragraph .05 (Document      link:      P/AU560.05/AUPROSTD)) because such changes typically reflect a      concurrent      evaluation of new conditions.

Given the potential for all of the overhang issues and given the significance of the receivables from the parent, we developed some pro-forma balance sheets for NNG and TW, which are attached.  These assume:     The note receivable from parent company continues to be classified as    current (represents net of all prior cash flows between NNG/TW and    parent)    The only borrowings under the revolvers relate to draw downs to repay    the Citibank bank debt assumed by NNG and TW  We have highlighted in red the critical numbers. Given the overhang issues at Enron Corp. I have the following questions:    Should the note receivable from parent be classified as current? (i.e.    would Enron truly be able to pay this amount to NNG/TW if needed)    How will the debt be repaid in one year if Enron Corp.'s note receivable    is not available to the pipelines?  Would you be able to draw down    additional debt?    Basically, what is the plan?    Is the only debt expected to be drawn on these revolvers the assumed    debt?  How much more in addition, if any?  Here is the basic plan, if something were to happen so that Enron was unable to pay NNG /TW back in time, then the notes with the bank would be transformed into term deals (length to be determined later).     The banks are comfortable that the ability to repay the notes exists in the pipes from the existing and projected cash flows of the entities.     There is no question that we should be able to borrow more against the pipes, with market multiples at 9X EBITDA and lenders willing to lend against it, there never has been a problem in that regard.   The securitizations of course will prevent the same kind of deals being done, but they are really to protect the banks from an Enron credit event (preference issues).   (See attached file: NNG FS pro forma.xls)(See attached file: TW FS pro forma.xls)   I have to believe that the banks did this before agreeing to extend so much credit - you might want to check around and see who provided this to the banks rather than re-creating the wheel (Kevin Howard maybe).

Gray indicated the following:  * Aviation budget number look comparable to operator standards (approx. $1,900 / hour, 600 hour estimate) * The plane has a market value of $1.8 - $2.0 million and a book value of $2.2 million * Turbo prop charters for trips to Tehachapi would run in excess of $1,100 / hour and may be limited as there are only two qualified operators * The Cessna is the only jet suitable for use to Tehachapi based on runway length and altitude * Gary will make a site visit before the end of the year  Assuming that of the budgeted 600 hours of operation, only 400 hours would require charter, the cost of charter would approach $0.5 million of the total budget of $1.2 million.  This plus the flexibility of using the plan on longer hauls (e.g., to Houston) make it economically justified.  My recommendation is that based on the current situation, we retain the aircraft.

We understand Enron's need for exceptionally fast action.  We have the crisis management expertise and I offer you our full and complete support in this time of need.  Mark, Paul and myself have been contributors to successful crisis interventions involving such companies as IBM, Texaco, Humana Hospitals, Texas Instruments, Hospital Corporation of America, Lucent Technologies, Atlanta Scientific, Honeywell, 3M, Phillips Petroleum Company?.  Rod, we are at your service immediately.    We know that in Enron's current crisis, you cannot: ? Grow fast enough to make a positive difference  ? Sell assets fast enough to make a positive difference ? Move fast enough into a major cost cutting program and reorganization of assets to generate the cash and credibility to needed to appease Wall Street  ? Aggressively communicate and perform those needed actions fast enough to regain support from Wall Street.  Due to the significance of this situation, we know that Enron would benefit greatly by reducing cost this week by 5-7 percent, with an additional 5-7 percent reduction next week, followed by an additional 5-7 percent over the next month - all while you and the leadership team continue to manage the external crisis.  This will get you the positive story and operating earnings needed to begin reestablishing your market position.  These are hard times and these unbearably hard decisions and their public announcement need to take place quickly.    We offer to help you and the leadership team: ? Speed the achievement of large scale cost reductions ? Quickly shore-up your most pressured areas of exposure ? Create the ""operations"" success story for Wall Street, investors, partnerships and employees ?

The Gas Logistics team was ""relocated"" off the 41st floor on October 5.  Prior to the move, we had a very efficient, open configuration that let us work together as a unified team.    After the move, we are located on 3 different floors.   Besides the general impact on team unity, this move also means that our evening staff work alone on separate floors, rather than in a group.  It means fewer individuals to cover customer calls.  It means having more equipment to cover the day to day business.   I have worked hard to calm the team that this arrangement is just temporary and that we will eventually be put back together as a team.  Prior to our move I constantly questioned whether our move was necessary.  I asked about smaller, more practical changes to fit more people on the floor.  And, I specifically asked about whether Enron issues might impact the groups desire to continue to spend $7-$10 million -- even as I reluctantly packed up my boxes.  I hope you can appreciate that the current seating arrangement is a serious issue for my team and one that generates constant questions as my staff meetings.

"Comments below.   -----Original Message----- From:  Mayeux, Gay   Sent: Wednesday, November 07, 2001 10:08 PM To: Hayslett, Rod; Eickenroht, Robert; Causey, Richard; Butts, Bob Cc: Horton, Stanley Subject: EOTT Conference Call - Enron related questions  On Tuesday we will have an EOTT conference call with investors to discuss EOTT's third quarter earnings.  I am concerned about some questions that may be asked relating to Enron.  Here is my stab at answering certain questions.  Please review and let me have your comments as soon as you can.  I would like to distribute on Friday the complete conference call script and Q&A that will include these answers.  Thanks   1.  Why did Enron sell its stake in EOTT? Enron decided in September of 2001 to monetize its ownership in EOTT (other than its 2% general partner ownership) which consisted of 3.3 million common units, 7 million subordinated units and $9.3 million additional partnership units. The monetization was recognized as a sale for book purposes and a financing for tax purposes.  Enron retained voting and dispositive power with respect to these interest.  Enron, being deemed a control person, filed the appropriate SEC documents with repect to this transaction.  2.   Does Enron still have an economic reason to care about the price of EOTT stock? As the general partner, Enron has a fiduciary responsiblity to act in the best interest of the unitholders of the partnership.    [I like your answer for simplicity sake, however in the interest of full disclosure here's more:  the pricing of the transaction was based upon a floor price with a final price for the units to be established at the conversion date of the sub units and the apis.    So besides the fiduciary responsibility, there is the fact that the final pricing on the deal has not occurred yet.]  3.  What is Enron's ownership of EOTT? From a voting and dispositive power standpoint, it is 39%.  4.  Is the general partnership for sale?  You will need to ask Enron that question. [Enron filed a 13D on September 6, 2001, stating the following: ""It is Enron's intention to review the disposition of and to possibly dispose of all or a portion of its direct and indirect interest in the partnerhip (including the common units and its interest in the general partner).""]  5.  What impact does Enron's current situation have on EOTT? [Two areas need to be addressed here - the tolling agreement and EOTT's ability to obtain three party bank financing.  I have EOTT to address these two questions.]         _________________________ Gay Mayeux Vice President, Investor Relations Enron Corp. 1400 Smith Street, EB 4931a Houston, Texas 77002  Phone:  713-853-9905 Cell:      713-416-8821 Fax:      713-646-3002 email:    gay.mayeux@enron.com",gay.mayeux@enron.com,rod.hayslett@enron.com,RE: EOTT Conference Call - Enron related questions,2001-11-08 04:28:25-08:00,sent

The pipe buying has been temporarily moved to Josh Mayes.  He can support the work for a short time but this is not optimal because of his current work load.  We need an experienced pipe buyer rather than a generalist.    The GTB project expediting was placed within EEOS because we did not have the staff to handle the work.  EEOS indicated they had the experienced staff and time available so Lisa hired them.  The performance has not been satisfactory.  We are concerned that the project will be impacted if we don't take steps to reassign the work.     We also need approval to move offices.

ENBT Delaware and Potomac Capital are shown in Secretariat as being owners of preferred stock in Organizational Partner, Inc. a wholly owned sub of Enron.  Mike Moran had previously advised us that these entities were third parties and that they had 25% of the voting interest in Organizational Partner, Inc.  After sifting through the layers of subs between NNG/TW and Enron Corp. we calculated that if we ascribe 25% ""ownership"" in Organizational partner to third parties, then Enron owns 99.5% of NNG and TW.  On this foundation Mike Moran had advised us to refer to NNG and TW as majority-owned subs of Enron in our GAAP financial statements (notes) and FERC Form 2 filings.  As per the note below, Andersen is trying to verify that the two preferred stock owners are indeed third parties, and not subs of Enron.

"This staff meeting is monday at 9:30 in 3AC.   -----Original Message----- From: =09Mahan, Mariella =20 Sent:=09Tuesday, November 13, 2001 2:54 PM To:=09Horton, Stanley; Hughes, James A.; Hayslett, Rod; Sommers, Jeffrey E. Subject:=09Confidential - Decision tree on projects  Something for us to talk about during our next staff meeting.  There are three projects which have significant cash flow problems and thus=  difficulties in meeting debt obligations: these are: SECLP, Panama and Gaz= a.  In the past, as I suppose we have done in Dabhol, we have taken the pos= ition that we would not inject cash into these companies and would be prepa= red to face a default and possible acceleration of the loans.  SECLP has be= en the biggest issue/problem.  Panama is much less (a few million of floati= ng of our receivables from the company) would be sufficient to meet the cas= h crunch in April of this year.  Note that, in Panama, the debt is fully gu= aranteed by the government and is non-recoursed to the operating company, B= LM.  In the past, we have discussed letting the debt default, which would c= ause the bank to potentially seek complete payment and acceleration from th= e GoPanama.  The reason: the vast majority of BLM's problems stem from acti= ons taken by the regulator that have effectively amended our PPA's with pri= vate parties; those actions resulted in significant loss of revenues, which=  although today have stopped or have been limited, have left a ""mark"" on th= e company's liquidity position. =20  Now the question is: come April of 2002, should any of our actions in Panam= a or decisions related thereto (which we would have otherwise taken or made= ) be affected in any way by either the proposed merger or an effort by Enro= n to preserve efforts to re-establish investor/creditor confidence?  The sa= me could go for SECLP and Gaza.  This is simply an overall ""guidance"" question.  Let's take it up during our=  staff meeting next week, if that's ok with you.

Foothills agreed to reflect the suggested changes to the model (An= dy is supposed to send out a summary of the discussion) and provided an ele= ctronic copy of the model for withdrawn partners' review. Withdrawn partner= s agreed to give their comments/feedback on the model to Foothills until 11= /27/01 and another meeting to reach an agreement on economic model/toll was=  scheduled for 12/03/01 or 12/04/01. The data from economic/toll model will=  be used in commercial proposal/presentation to the ANS producers which ANN= GTC intends to have by 12/20/01. Tim and I will review Foothills' cash flow=  and COS model and prepare comments.  Overall, the participants though that the current Foothills model ($0.43/MM= Btu toll for Alaska section) has very aggressive assumptions in many ways, = and it is very likely that the toll will be increased significantly after a= ll the appropriate revisions are made. The following are the main discussio= n points of the meeting. Item 1 and 2 are expected to have a very large imp= act on the toll.  1) Capex and Opex need to have annual/monthly escalation (current model has=  0% escalation). For example, Foothills sensitivity analysis shows that 2.5= % Capex escalation would increase the toll by $0.20. Numbers such as 1.5% f= or Capex and 2.5% for Opex were thrown during the meeting, but more reviews=  need to be done regarding appropriate escalation rates. Do you have any op= inion on this, Bryan?  2) Foothills is using Flowthrough method (using cash taxes in COS calculati= on) to calculate income taxes that go into the Cost of Service and might be=  underestimating Cost of Service. Tim thought that the Flowthrough method w= ill not fly because of previous cases in which that method was not allowed = by IRS and FERC. Foothills said that they can still have same toll under No= rmalized tax method by changing the depreciation number, but Tim was concer= ned that it might force the partnership to record negative depreciation. Fo= othills declined our request to share their Cost of Service model and insis= ted that we calculate the toll ourselves based on the information in the ca= sh flow model. They agreed to provide a hard copy of their Cost of Service = model in the end, but Tim and I were under impression that Foothills was tr= ying to lower the toll as much as they can. Tim was also concerned about le= velized toll approach because of FERC might lower allowed return in the lat= er rate cases and more analysis needs to done regradign this. Please correc= t me if I am wrong here, Tim.  3) OM & A is currently estimated to be 1% of Capex but this might be too lo= w (OM&A in more latest cost estimate by Foothills is approx. 1.5% of total = Capex).  4) The Withdrawn Partners' historical contributions ($228 million) will be = added to the Rate Base, but this might be dropped if necessary. Success fee=  of $40 million should be included in the project budget.  5) Working Capital will be added to the project cost. The Line Pack cost (1= 4.5 Bcf for the whole section) was assumed to be borne by ANS producers but=  some participants highly doubted that that would be the case. The Line Pac= k gas might have to be bought by the Partnership or the Producers will at l= east demand certain return on their gas sitting in the pipeline for 25 year= s.  6) For Return on Capital and AFUDC, 14% ROE and 8% Interest on Debt assumin= g 30/70 capital structure is likely to be kept. However, the current drawdo= wn schedule assumes construction financing available from the very beginnin= g, which will not be true. Certain assumptions should be made on the financ= ial close date and commercial agreement/preliminary determination date to c= alculate AFUDC more accurately.  7) Current financing assumption in the model is a 25 year bank loan with ba= lloon amortization and DSCR of 1.6. In reality, the initial bank loans will=  be of shorter maturity (5-15 years) and certain roll-over financing will b= e unavoidable. It is also likely that the loans will have multiple tranches=  with different terms, interest rate, seniority etc.=20  8) There is significant currency risk associated with Canadian section of t= he ANGTS considering that some sources of capital, revenues and part of ope= rating expenses will be in Canadian dollars. A mechanis to mitigate currenc= y risk should be in place and there might be some costs associated with it.  9) Property taxes of 2% in Alaska seems high, but Property taxes during con= struction period should be added.=20  Lastly, there is about $300 million difference ($4,336-$4035) between ETS c= urrent cost estimates and the cost estimate in the Foothills model, excludi= ng IDC and AFUDC. Another engineering estimate might have to be dome for la= rger pipe size (46 or 48 inch) as noted in Bryan's email. =20  Thanks,=20  JB=20  Jebong Lee=20 713-853-9722 office=20 713-306-8658 cell",rod.hayslett@enron.com,e..rosenberg@enron.com,RE: Toll Model Review Meeting Updates,2001-11-17 10:04:42-08:00,received

It is poss= ible they will ask for additional information. =20 =20 Nicaragua:  Current credit ratings required the funding of approximately $6= .3 million into a debt service reserve account (project was allowed to swee= p the funds against a corporate guarantee by Enron, which was backstopped b= y the partners pro-rata to their ownership in the project).  Partners to re= imburse Enron their pro-rata share, such that Enron's ultimate outflow will=  be approximately $2.2 million.  Team tried to get MARAD to agree to altern= ative solutions but MARAD simply refused citing bad past experience and pol= itical implications. =20 Panama:  Team in Houston last week to review the upcoming PPA bids by Elekt= ra (one of the two distribution companies in Panama).  Three issues are wor= th noting: (i) requirement to post bid bonds (approximately $10 million) wi= ll likely need some sort of Enron support (BLM can't get bid bonds on its o= wn although local management continues attempting to do so); (ii) BLM's mar= ginal costs are among highest in Panama.  A preliminary strategy has been m= apped out; and (iii) PPA terms are a bit ""one-sided"" in favor of the distri= butor.  BLM and other market participants have tried repeatedly to get the = distco to change terms without success. =20 =20 Dominican Republic:  El Paso confirmed it can't work with us.  Operationall= y, the plant is working well.  As noted on an earlier e-mail, EFI's fuel su= pplier for SECLP, Vitol, asked for a letter of credit or pre-payment terms.=   Enron rejected the request.  SECLP bought cargo directly from Vitol.  We = are working closely with Tom Moran of ENE credit on these issues. =20 Ecoelectrica: This week was a very productive week.  Update as follows:  Lender Process: =  Based on several conversations this week, lenders have stated they underst= and that Mirant's insurance package is the result of market conditions.  Le= nders are prepared to pursue credit committee approval with the $300 millio= n coverage.  Mirant offered a 6-month only waiver on the deductibles.  Lend= ers appear content with that option.  ENE insurance has approximately 75% o= f the underwriters on board with our back-up plan to provide the additional=  $200 million tranche.  Backup will be used only if credit committee(s) kic= k back existing coverage.  Mirant to issue a certification of compliance wi= th QF (by Eco) and a legal opinion asap.  Based on the progress this week a= nd the remaining commitment on deliverables, it is expected that the lender= 's agent can put together the entire lender package and submit it to the le= nder group by Tuesday of next week.  Finally, Mirant also committed to prov= iding comments (if any) to the Lender Consent Agreement.  ENE and EME have = reviewed and provided comments already.  GE Consent:  Mirant committed to s= ending their ""versions"" of the key documents on the GE buy-out on Friday ni= te (late).  I have not seen the document but they have repeatedly stated th= at the documents are ""conforming"".  Union Carbide Guarantee:  Plan to final= ize language early next week.  Schedule:  Mirant has committed to fulfillin= g CP's as early as possible (and is acting on that statement) as long as we=  can allow them to fund on 12/19.  They state they are confident they can c= lose CP's by earlier than 12/14 and can fund on 12/19.  CSFB has not shed l= ight on the apparent funding (timing) limitation but has offered to investi= gate further. =20 =20 APACHI =20 =20 Philippines: The team did an excellent job of advancing discussions and neg= otiations with NPC but was unable to move the slow government machinery fas= t enough to make it to a signing by last Thursday's New York event.  Nevert= heless, momentum is high and team continues to work toward a 12/15 agreemen= t date; funding wouldn't occur until early next year.=20 =20 Guam:  Continue discussions with Mirant and AES with a focus on getting the= m over the hump on the issue of Enron's contingent obligation to cover the = potential shortfall under a GPA buy-out event.  Work continues.  Meetings h= ave been set with Dr. Boyce to discuss his interest in the Guam project. = =20 =20 China:  Unit 2 still scheduled to come back on line on 11/23.  Two likely c= auses still under investigation (poor vaccum or material design flaw).  Wor= k on capital reduction for Chengdu on hold until discussions are held with = Houston to ensure consensus.  In the mean time, several parties have approa= ched us with interest in Chengdu.  On Hainan, team is paying several visits=  to the new SAFE representatives, first to work on the mid November repayme= nt ($10 million).   Next step would be liquidation. =20 =20 Europe =20 =20 Gaza:  Waiting to hear from CCC (partner) on conceptual proposal: ENE to pr= ovide limited technical support and financial services support to help put = in place cost over-run facility and to help with remaining construction act= ivities and CCC to take our equity (at no cost) and any remaining obligatio= ns.  Aim is to eliminate the potential exposure on ENE's $9 million of guar= antees. =20 =20 Trakya:  During meetings in London, OPIC informed us that they had had good=  meetings with the Ministry of Finance and Ministry of Energy.  Government = stated they would ""clean up"" arrears but could not do so before January 200= 2 (presumably there are no budget funds left).

I know you're out of the office until Wednesday but I thought if you could respond by Blackberry or phone as to which case we should send to TCPL, I would get that to them before the holiday so they could work on it Thursday and Friday.  * Case 1 is an 8% distribution growth case (starting with the plan and increasing acquisition activity to deliver 8% growth).  To achieve that our total capex for NBP goes up to an average of just over $400 million per year. * Case 2 tracks with our budget case and involves about $200 million in capex per year and results in 2 years of 8% growth and then a flat distribution level for the remaining 3 years. * Case 3 utilizes the budget case but eliminates all acquisitions (capex is about $30 - $40 million average per year for maintenance and asset development) and assumes NBPL recontracting occurs at 85% of max rates.  The result is distributions increase to $3.30 in 2002 and stay at that level throughout the 5 year period.  Obviously Case 1 is the most aggressive in terms of valuation among the three.

Financial Trading Risk Data We provide aggregate position data for ETS not aggregate VAR, e.g.  ETS is long 10 MMCFD natural gas at Ventura for January 2002, etc. vs. ETS has $1.5 million total VAR.  This is necessary for two reasons: 1.) Enron's VAR does not necessarily equal the sum of its subsidiaries VAR since there may be offsetting positions  throughout the business units.  2.)

Foothills agreed to reflect the suggested changes to the model (An= dy is supposed to send out a summary of the discussion) and provided an ele= ctronic copy of the model for withdrawn partners' review. Withdrawn partner= s agreed to give their comments/feedback on the model to Foothills until 11= /27/01 and another meeting to reach an agreement on economic model/toll was=  scheduled for 12/03/01 or 12/04/01. The data from economic/toll model will=  be used in commercial proposal/presentation to the ANS producers which ANN= GTC intends to have by 12/20/01. Tim and I will review Foothills' cash flow=  and COS model and prepare comments.  Overall, the participants though that the current Foothills model ($0.43/MM= Btu toll for Alaska section) has very aggressive assumptions in many ways, = and it is very likely that the toll will be increased significantly after a= ll the appropriate revisions are made. The following are the main discussio= n points of the meeting. Item 1 and 2 are expected to have a very large imp= act on the toll.  1) Capex and Opex need to have annual/monthly escalation (current model has=  0% escalation). For example, Foothills sensitivity analysis shows that 2.5= % Capex escalation would increase the toll by $0.20. Numbers such as 1.5% f= or Capex and 2.5% for Opex were thrown during the meeting, but more reviews=  need to be done regarding appropriate escalation rates. Do you have any op= inion on this, Bryan?  2) Foothills is using Flowthrough method (using cash taxes in COS calculati= on) to calculate income taxes that go into the Cost of Service and might be=  underestimating Cost of Service. Tim thought that the Flowthrough method w= ill not fly because of previous cases in which that method was not allowed = by IRS and FERC. Foothills said that they can still have same toll under No= rmalized tax method by changing the depreciation number, but Tim was concer= ned that it might force the partnership to record negative depreciation. Fo= othills declined our request to share their Cost of Service model and insis= ted that we calculate the toll ourselves based on the information in the ca= sh flow model. They agreed to provide a hard copy of their Cost of Service = model in the end, but Tim and I were under impression that Foothills was tr= ying to lower the toll as much as they can. Tim was also concerned about le= velized toll approach because of FERC might lower allowed return in the lat= er rate cases and more analysis needs to done regradign this. Please correc= t me if I am wrong here, Tim.  3) OM & A is currently estimated to be 1% of Capex but this might be too lo= w (OM&A in more latest cost estimate by Foothills is approx. 1.5% of total = Capex).  4) The Withdrawn Partners' historical contributions ($228 million) will be = added to the Rate Base, but this might be dropped if necessary. Success fee=  of $40 million should be included in the project budget.  5) Working Capital will be added to the project cost.

ENA/ENW does not want to address the remaining PGAS project cost owed ETS until the asset is sold to AEP which probably won't happen this year.  They still owe us about $194,000 of project cost.  As I see it, they can either accept their amortization which will begin when we close the workorder or accept a final debit for the balance owed.   I prefer the latter and have suggested that to Tommy, but he needs to know why this would be necessary.  What are ETS requirements for this reimbursement.

Your last mention of this when I saw you at A&M indicated that it had become a lower priority.  I think my management is going to want ETS to be reimbursed for remaining cost owed it in 2001 one way or the other.  I would like to take them some current information.  I still think it would be most appropriate for ENA to reimburse us now since work is complete and since they own the asset.

This tax can be avoided completely if the distributions of cash take the form of intercompany loans which are settled at the close of the sale of PGE. Significant tax research and intercompany briefings took place on this very topic in July and August of this year.  The procedures for settlement of the loans are already baked into the PGE purchase and sale agreement. It is my understanding that some loans of cash have already been made under this procedure, but I am the wrong person to talk to about PGE issues or that sort.  Rod Hayslett would have more information.    Jim Ginty is the appropriate tax department contact for PGE Purchase and Sale Agreement issues.

The following is a list of steps  taken to prepare the plant for this outage:    Lines and vessels have been purged and are mostly open to the atmosphere.  Lubricating oils have been drained from equipment, ""large oil systems"" (e.g. syn gas and recycle compressor lube  systems) have been soap washed.  Oily water sewer and separation vessels have been washed with soap.  Chemical storage vessels have been cleaned out or removed from the plant.  Cooling tower wooden structures have been demolished and removed from the site.  Industrial gases (e.g. calibration, welding, etc.) have been removed from the plant.  Natural gas and oxygen lines to the facility have been blinded at the battery limits.  All catalyst and resins have been removed from the plant.  All firefighting equipment (e.g. fire water, monitors, extinguishers, foam, foam truck, etc.) remain in the facility  and are serviceable.  LEL monitoring equipment and the Whalen alarm system remain in service and are serviceable.  Provisions are being made for necessary periodic inspection of fire extinguishers. (Should LEL test, alarm test,  monitor inspection, be included?)  Electrical power will remain to all facilities and will be serviceable.  All current utilities to the Tank Farm/Barge Loading Facilities will remain and will be serviceable.  The process area will be secured by a six foot high chain link fence with 20' wide gates on each side at drive in  points.  The gates will be locked.   The oxygen compressor located in Sunoco area will be secured by a six foot high chain link fence with one pedestrian  gate (locked).

Specifically, he is to provide a report advising Enron's plans for this facility including the details of the ""shut down"" process, maintenance of the facility, security at the site, etc. This information will be provided to Enron Corp Property Package underwriters when received. Our current understanding is that the facility has not been operating for the past 30 days and is preparing for a longer term shut down phase. We further understand from our conversation that Enron is clearing the product streams from the system and that the plant is currently ""hydrocarbon free"" thus eliminating a substantial portion of the facility fire hazards. Also, we understand that the tank farm and control building will continue to operate. Enron is maintaining front gate security and is considering a separate fencing around the process area.  Paul, we look forward to receiving the report as requested. Please advise status.

Financial Trading Risk Data We provide aggregate position data for ETS not aggregate VAR, e.g.  ETS is long 10 MMCFD natural gas at Ventura for January 2002, etc. vs. ETS has $1.5 million total VAR.  This is necessary for two reasons: 1.) Enron's VAR does not necessarily equal the sum of its subsidiaries VAR since there may be offsetting positions  throughout the business units.  2.)  Our trading books software (Caminus) does not have the capability to compute VAR in accordance with the specific methodology required (Monte Carlo simulation) in the Enron policy.

"Here is 1997-2000 TW Transportation Revenue by Contract, Sorted by Contract Expiration Date.  To get a breakdown of long-term/short-term, for each year I would include contracts that expire within the next year & IT as short term, with the remainder as LT.  For example, for 1997, I'd say that the revenues from contracts that expire on or before 12/31/98 + IT make up the short term revenues.      -----Original Message----- From:  Hayslett, Rod   Sent: Wednesday, November 21, 2001 8:43 AM To: Lokay, Michelle Cc: Corman, Shelley Subject: FW: Additional TW information request  Do you know where I might be able to get this kind of information?   -----Original Message----- From:  Hayslett, Rod   Sent: Wednesday, November 21, 2001 8:16 AM To: Geaccone, Tracy Cc: Moore, Jan Subject: FW: Additional TW information request  Tracy:  I need your help.

We believe the information that Jayshree and I have included in the attached spreadsheet will help the potential investors become more comfortable with the numbers.   This information should include a breakdown of revenues based on existing capacity, Gallup and Red Rock.  Please note that under the transportation section the first subheading is a volume request and the other sub-headings are revenue requests.  We would also like a better understanding of the capacity utilized for each section.  From an operational expense standpoint we need to show the historical breakdown, but going forward we need to assume that TW is a standalone entity. This should include additional costs for ""reverse synergies.""  Also, a breakdown of CAPEX would be helpful.  I don't know if all of this information is readily available, but any information you have would be greatly helpful.  As you discussed with Jayshree would you please send the 2001 and 2002 models to us electronically?  If you have this information in many places please send it to me and I would be happy to incorporate it into the template if it would save you time.    Please let me know if you feel the template does not capture the relevant information.  I will be in at 7am tomorrow if you would like to discuss this information.

We believe the information that Jayshree and I have included in the attached spreadsheet will help the potential investors become more comfortable with the numbers.   This information should include a breakdown of revenues based on existing capacity, Gallup and Red Rock.  Please note that under the transportation section the first subheading is a volume request and the other sub-headings are revenue requests.  We would also like a better understanding of the capacity utilized for each section.  From an operational expense standpoint we need to show the historical breakdown, but going forward we need to assume that TW is a standalone entity. This should include additional costs for ""reverse synergies.""  Also, a breakdown of CAPEX would be helpful.  I don't know if all of this information is readily available, but any information you have would be greatly helpful.  As you discussed with Jayshree would you please send the 2001 and 2002 models to us electronically?  If you have this information in many places please send it to me and I would be happy to incorporate it into the template if it would save you time.

As we discussed this morning, distributions of cash in the form of dividends will be subject to a tax of approximately 7%.  This tax can be avoided completely if the distributions of cash take the form of intercompany loans which are settled at the close of the sale of PGE. Significant tax research and intercompany briefings took place on this very topic in July and August of this year.  The procedures for settlement of the loans are already baked into the PGE purchase and sale agreement. It is my understanding that some loans of cash have already been made under this procedure, but I am the wrong person to talk to about PGE issues or that sort.  Rod Hayslett would have more information.=20 =20 Jim Ginty is the appropriate tax department contact for PGE Purchase and Sale Agreement issues.=20  Regards,=20  Alicia Goodrow  -----Original Message----- From: Adams, Gregory=20 Sent: Monday, November 19, 2001 10:36 AM To: Goodrow, Alicia Subject: FW: PGE Dividend   Alicia,  Do we know / can we quantify the amount of undistributed/retained earnings as of Sepetmber 30th, and what the tax impact would be of distributing that amount.

This bust period is likely to  last for several years. Western gas markets have also entered a bust with the  delayed start to winter and full storage inventories exerting downward pressure  on both North American prices and western basis differentials. Through the  remainder of this year and into well into next, western regional gas and power  markets will remain soft and possibly weaken further.  *  Power operating reserves should rise to above 15 percent by next summer in  the Southwest and California, pushing power prices down and improving  reliability.  *  Power demand is expected to shrink by 11 percent in the fourth quarter;  market contractions will return demand in 2002 to levels experienced in 1998.   *  Full gas storage inventories, huge declines in year-over-year demand, and  the onset of significant pipeline capacity additions will keep a lid on West  Coast differentials.  **end**  Follow above URL for complete Monthly Briefing (11 printed pages).

" Please see the attached comparison of the Phase 6 that we have in the 2002-2006 Plan versus Dave's analysis.  For the Plan, we ran it with and without Phase 6 to determine the incremental change.  The worksheet attached also shows the Returns on Equity and Capitalization (with and without) based on the Plan runs.  You will have a reasonable apples-to-apples if you compare the amounts at the Operating Income level because Dave did not assume how it was financed in his analysis however my depreciation is GAAP but Dave's is Tax.  There are only two significant differences:  1)  For conservatism, Dave used the settled rate rather than the rate refund floor rate in 2004.  In Dave's calculations this made a difference of  about 2.9 cents (77.60 cts vs. 74.71 cts. ) for the customers other than FP&L in 2004.  There is no difference for FP&L because their 2004 rate cap is 74.60 cts, lower than either the settled or rate refund floor rates.  (Per Dave, in the risk analyses the rate refund floor impact WAS included.)  2)  We got a lower Ad Valorem tax estimate from Ted Ryan than what Dave used.

"Probably.   Please call Kathy Campos to get on my calendar.     the margins for 2001 and 2002 are not the same and I didn't think we had 2001 in the other model in detail.    Existing includes Gallup, and it will be nearly imposiible to identify it as separate because there have been some changes to the original contracts for Gallup.   You can try, but now you are talking about getting into parts of contracts.

As we discussed this morning, distributions of cash in the form of dividends will be subject to a tax of approximately 7%.  This tax can be avoided completely if the distributions of cash take the form of intercompany loans which are settled at the close of the sale of PGE. Significant tax research and intercompany briefings took place on this very topic in July and August of this year.  The procedures for settlement of the loans are already baked into the PGE purchase and sale agreement. It is my understanding that some loans of cash have already been made under this procedure, but I am the wrong person to talk to about PGE issues or that sort.

"I have asked and will let you know the answer later today.    The bigger question is that they can not loan money to Enron and can only dividend, so if they can do something to raise the cash, they still can't get it out any more out than they can by dividending.    The other problem is that they are running into cash problems themselves since they were in the process of going to the bond markets when all of this occurred, and were advised to wait.   Their receivables from California are part of the problem.

I had been interviewing for the open accountant position prior to leaving for vacation.  I have interviewed one internal and two external candidates.  I had indicated I would be notifying them this week of my hiring decision. The position needs to be filled for the following reasons:  Northern Border Partners has completed 3 major acquisitions this year and one at the end of third quarter last year. We have been transitioning these companies to SAP this year resulting in significantly higher maintenance time for additional companies, all internal coding (Cost centers/FARorders), intercompany reconcilliations, account reconcilliations. All companies are consolidated with Northern Border Partners requiring financial statement preparation We will be bringing on Midwestern Gas Transmission Company effective January 1.  Their accounting in currently being done by El Paso through the end of the year. We continue to be behind on certain routine activities, bank reconcilliations being the primary one.  With the additional companies, this has increased the level of activity in this area. IPayit has created additional manual accounts payable processing due to issues with payment processing through the system. All of the additional companies has resulted in additional wire transfer activity which is all entered manually in our department. The acquisition of a Canadian operation has resulted in significant time required in working with the 3rd party that  is operating this facility as well as now requiring foreign currency translation.

I had been interviewing for the open accountant position prior to leaving for vacation.  I have interviewed one internal and two external candidates.  I had indicated I would be notifying them this week of my hiring decision. The position needs to be filled for the following reasons:  Northern Border Partners has completed 3 major acquisitions this year and one at the end of third quarter last year. We have been transitioning these companies to SAP this year resulting in significantly higher maintenance time for additional companies, all internal coding (Cost centers/FARorders), intercompany reconcilliations, account reconcilliations. All companies are consolidated with Northern Border Partners requiring financial statement preparation We will be bringing on Midwestern Gas Transmission Company effective January 1.  Their accounting in currently being done by El Paso through the end of the year. We continue to be behind on certain routine activities, bank reconcilliations being the primary one.  With the additional companies, this has increased the level of activity in this area. IPayit has created additional manual accounts payable processing due to issues with payment processing through the system. All of the additional companies has resulted in additional wire transfer activity which is all entered manually in our department. The acquisition of a Canadian operation has resulted in significant time required in working with the 3rd party that  is operating this facility as well as now requiring foreign currency translation. New accounting requirements are requiring additional analysis and reporting requirements.  I am available to discuss any of the above issues at your convenience.

He asked about the use of the pipeline assets to pull Enron thru the liquidity crisis.  I gave him a brief overview of the Dynegy cash infusion and the bank revolvers.  He said there was some concern at the FERC that projects we might be proposing may not be able to be funded due to the reduced ability of the pipelines to obtain outside financing due to the securitization of the all the assets.  I indicated that it was my opinion that good investments in pipeline facilities would probably be looked on favorably at Enron these days.  Thought you'd want a quick update.

Sent: Tuesday, February 12, 2002 10:35 AM To: Hayslett, Rod; Geaccone, Tracy; Chandler, Bob; Saunders, James; Corman, Shelley Cc: Desai, Jayshree Subject: NNG 10 year valuation model  I met with Jayshree Desai this morning to discuss the recommended changes to the NNG valuation model.  She will make these and circulate the model later today.  I few items worth mentioning -  1) Capex assumptions still seem too high for 2002-2004.  However, the 2002 number is some $30 million below the ""Dynegy transition"" capex amount shown in the 2002 Capex schedule.  Can we just assume non-discretionary only with the Base Gas repurchase in 2002/2003? Any discretionary would be commercially-driven.   This should be true. 2) Keep O&M flat to 2001 numbers? Yes 3) Tracy / Shelley - Any thoughts on how to incorporate the contract info to better analyze the ""contract roll off"" scenarios? We have just assumed the 2002 Plan with 1-2% growth rate going forward with a new rate case in effect in 2005. Rod, not sure how you want to look at rate case assumptions or expansion opportunities but we can discuss tomorrow.

No further written proposal is required by Dynegy and restated capital budget will constitute the written authorization to proceed with these projects.     With respect to Footnote 2.  I believe the description below more precisely reflects our discussion:   2.  Dynegy requested and Enron agreed that NNG will not be charged any additional amounts for the Base Contract System through June 30, 2002, UNLESS Dynegy authorizes Enron to begin work on the customization and implementation of the NNG contract system prior to June 30, 2002.   To the extent that Enron is not directed to begin work on the customization of the base contract system for NNG prior to June 30, 2002, it is understood that the implementation date of the NNG contract system will be impacted.   3.  Dynegy requested and Enron agreed that NNG will not be charged any additional amounts for the Base Rates and Revenue System through June 30, 2002.       An additional footnote should be added to the page.   4.    The 2002 Capital Budget does not currently authorize the system modifications that will be necessary to implement NNG's Order 637 filing/revised filing provisions or GISB changes.   Dynegy and Enron will need to mutually agree whether to commence work on these modifications to meet filing commitments or expected FERC requirements.        -----Original Message----- From: Don.Vignaroli@dynegy.com [mailto:Don.Vignaroli@dynegy.com] Sent: Thursday, February 21, 2002 5:23 PM To: Len.Hesseltine@dynegy.com; John.O'Shea@dynegy.com; Dan.Dienstbier@dynegy.com; Carolyn.J.Stone@dynegy.com; Mary.Kay.Miller@dynegy.com; Dave.Neubauer@dynegy.com; Mike.Mcgowan@dynegy.com; Steve.Gilbert@dynegy.com; Keith.Petersen@dynegy.com; Lowry, Phil; Rice, Randy; Pribble, Dan; Nelson, Mike; Brassfield, Morris; Corman, Shelley; Hotte, Steve; Kleb, Steve; Concklin, Elaine Subject: Restated 2002 CAPEX Plan     Attached for your review and information is a copy of the Restated 2002 Capital Budget (25 page report) which reflects the planned CAPEX recently agreed to between NNG/Dynegy and Enron.
