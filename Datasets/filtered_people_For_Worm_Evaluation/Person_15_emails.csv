Based on discussions that Russell Diamond has had with Matt Crocker, in Section (e), the definition of Credit Support Provider in clause (ii) should eliminate all of the language after the proviso.  2.   I think we need to amend the definition of ""Material Adverse Change"" in the CSA to refer to Party B's Credit Support Provider.  3.   In Section (g), in the second line of (g)(1) the word ""Provided"" should be changed to ""Provider"".  I am still reviewing the form of Guaranty which you sent.  I will have Susan Bailey send you our form of Guaranty shortly.  I would prefer if we attach the forms of Guarantys to the Assignment Agreement and refer to the forms in Section (d).

"Dan: I have taken a very quick look at the Financial Swaps Section.  Here are my  thoughts:  1. Are there any ""credit terms"" that need to be disclosed at this point?   Should it be made subject to credit terms?  Should we mention that these  swaps will be documented under an ISDA Master Agreement with schedules to be  negotiated or will the swps be done under the existing Master Agreement that  we have with Olympic?  2. In Section A, I am not familiar with the ""EnronOnline 1-2 month bid price,  but I'm assuming that one of our businerss people has taken a look at this  wording and is okay with it.  3.

I've asked John Morissette, our contract administrator, to get you the information needed to fill out the Party B info on the cover sheet.   When I download your document, the check boxes on the cover sheet do not appear, so I am having John and our credit person, Valerie Mooney, checking it.  All the language in the ""Other Changes"" section (except the payment provision) looks in good order.  I understand that the billing and payment issue is still being discussed, and I was asked to mention it to you as well.  All of Select's counter-parties under Master Agreements expect payment to be made by the later of the twentieth day of the month following service, or 10 days after an invoice. If Select agrees to make payments within 5 days after an invoice, but only receives revenues on the 10th day, it creates a cash flow problem for Select.  How do you suggest that we resolve this issue?  It seems to be a football going back and forth between the credit and the billings folks.  Also, since we are so close to finalizing the document, we need to have the appropriate folks work on putting together Attachment A (referenced in Part 1., (b) Prior Transactions).  Janice thought that the Enron folks would take a first shot at the document, and then Select could verify it.  Can you move that along to the appropriate people?

"I'm working on the Merrill/Belco assignment of trades with, I guess, Sara.   Mark Taylor signed off yesterday on the assignment that appears to again have  been executed by Fred without Legal's initials.  It appears the date Fred  signed it is about the time Mark Taylor talked to him about not signing  contractual documents without Legal's initials.  There appears to be two differences in the redone confirms Merrill sent us:   (1)  they added a Fallback Reference Price, and (2) they have changed the  settlement and/or payment dates in the confirms.  Bernice said Sara signed off on a similar Fallback Reference Price in some  confirms she had previously done with Merrill, so I briefly discussed this  with Sara before she had to leave for lunch.  We'll look at it some more  after lunch.  On the change in the settlement/payment dates, I told Bernice they were  changing the deal and she needed the business guy on the transactions to sign  off on that change.  She was going to take the confirms to Fred and get him  to sign off that that is what he's agreed to.  Now, if Sara doesn't know anything about the additional Fallback Reference  Price, we'll obviously have to take that back to the dealmaker to sign off on  too.  Are you also working on this?

Forcenergy Seeks OK For Asset Sale, Bidding Procedures Forcenergy Inc. has asked the court to authorize the sale of seven oil and gas properties to Hilcorp Energy I L.P. as well as procedures designed to draw competing bids for the assets through an auction. The motion, filed Sept. 13 with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in New Orleans, requests permission to sell five Louisiana and two Texas properties and related assets to Hilcorp, subject to better offers. Hilcorp has offered Forcenergy $6,086,000 in cash for the properties. Sierra Mineral Development L.C. indicated interest in purchasing the Texas and Louisiana properties in late 1998. In March, one month after signing a letter of interest with Sierra, Forcenergy filed for Chapter 11 relief. Hilcorp then agreed to finance Sierra?s purchase of the Forcenergy properties. Any purchase agreement will list only the names of Forcenergy and Hilcorp. The terms of the agreement include Hilcorp?s responsibility to ""assume all liabilities related to the Property after the Effective Date, and all Plugging and Abandonment Obligations and Environmental Obligations, if any, regardless of when incurred,"" the filing reports. Forcenergy claims that this is a fortuitous time for the approval of the sale due to the current stable cash flow, the production of its onshore properties, and the potential for sustained growth in its offshore Gulf of Mexico drilling facilities. The oil and gas explorer and producer also requested the approval of overbid procedures, recognizing that new interest in Forcenergy?s properties may come after other interested parties review the purchase agreement. Any person submitting an overbid to counsel for the creditors? committee, Hilcorp, Forcenergy, and the Bank Group is subject to offering a price of no less than $6,236,000 and the elimination of any break up expense reimbursement. Competing bidders for the assets must submit a deposit equal to 10% of its bid plus evidence that it is able to consummate the transaction.  After the last overbid, the court will allow Hilcorp the opportunity to overbid by an additional $50,000. Any further bidding will continue in $50,000 increments. If the court approves the purchase of the properties by a bidder other than Hilcorp, Forcenergy would pay up to the $100,000 that Hilcorp estimates it will incur as its costs and fees related to the sale. If a break-up expense reimbursement becomes necessary, Hilcorp will provide documentation of expenses to the court. Forcenergy also asked the court to approve its list and calculation of amounts to be paid to cure all of its pre-petition defaults. ""If no amount is listed, the Debtor believes that there is no Pre-Petition Cure Amount due and owing to that party,"" the motion states. ""The Debtor requests that, unless a party files an objection to the Pre-Petition Cure Amount so scheduled and serves a copy on Debtor?s counsel by the time to be fixed by the Court at the Procedures Hearing, such party should be forever barred from objecting to the Pre-Petition Cure Amount,"" the filing further contends. The company?s revenues declined after a decrease in gas and oil prices in late 1998 and early 1999. The declining revenues also negatively impacted the company after 1997 and 1998 acquisitions outlays. The court has not yet set a hearing date on the bidding procedures request.

As a general rule, most of these counterparties  object to such provisions.

From:  John Suttle                           11/08/99 04:54 PM    To: Sara Shackleton/HOU/ECT@ECT, Carol St Clair/HOU/ECT@ECT cc:   Subject: Canadian Memo  Rob,  The following is an update on the ongoing situations with some of the  Canadian counterparties that have recently changed their corporate  structures.  Clearly there are some issues that should be discussed regarding  the approach Enron should take moving forward.  On some issues, we are at a  point that decisions need to be made on whether or not to begin exercising  our contractual rights.  Other issues remain to be resolved within Credit,  and I expect these to be resolved within the next week.  Please call me to discuss any questions you might have with the following.   1) Dominion Energy Inc. acquired Remington Energy Ltd. in April 1999.   Remington operates as a wholly owned subsidiary under Dominion Energy Inc.  and has a Master Physical under which its deals have been confirmed.  It has  failed on each of the financial MAC covenants in the contract.  Repeated  efforts have been made to obtain a parent guaranty from Dominion including  conversations that have taken place with both commercial and credit  contacts.  Nonetheless, the counterparty to date has been unresponsive to  guaranty inquiries.  In the past few weeks, repeated phone calls to our  Dominion contacts have not been returned.  Current mark-to-market exposure  for Remington is approximately $9MM USD.    2) Marathon Canada Ltd., a wholly owned sub of Marathon Oil Company (BBB-),  acquired Tarragon  Oil and Gas Ltd. in August 1998.  Marathon Canada Ltd. is  a private company and requested a confidentiality agreement prior to its  providing financial statements.  Enron delivered the CA in July 1999 and  Marathon provided unaudited financials November 4.  Tarragon has a Master  Physical in place and has MACd on its covenants as a result of not providing  financial statements.  The financial statements provided need to be discussed  in further detail with the counterparty.  A request for parent guaranty from  Marathon Oil Company may be the final option prior to calling for  collateral.  Total exposure to the combined entity is $13.5MM USD.    3) Talisman Energy Inc. acquired both Rigel Oil and Gas Ltd. and Highridge  Exploration Ltd.  We have transactions confirmed under a Master Swap and a  Master Physical with Highridge,  a Master Physical and a Master Swap with  Talisman, and a Master Physical with Rigel.  Talisman has agreed to assign  all outstanding deals to the existing master contracts we have in place with  Talisman Energy Inc.  As soon as possible, we need legal to draft paper to  Talisman moving the outstanding deals under the Rigel and Highridge contracts  to the Talisman contracts.  In the same letter, Talisman has agreed to  terminate the Rigel and Highridge contracts.  In return, credit has agreed to  review the collateral thresholds and credit terms in the existing Talisman  contracts.  Talisman has its third quarter financials available this Friday.   By the end of next week we should be able to send the letter to Talisman with  amendments, transaction transfers, and Rigel/Highridge contract  terminations.  Combined exposure for the entities is approximately $30MM USD.  4) Renaissance Energy Ltd. amalgamated Pinnacle Resources Ltd.  We have one  deal on the books, but no contracts with Renaissance. We have a long term  deal confirmed under a Master Swap and a long term deal confirmed under a  Master Physical with Pinnacle.  Pinnacle does not want to move the existing  Renaissance deal under the Pinnacle master agreement.  It appears as though  Renaissance is finalizing a sale of assets that will include some Pinnacle  properties.  If they sell the Pinnacle properties underlying our deals, they  said they would probably assign the outstanding deals and contracts to the  purchaser (presumably after obtaining Enron approval for such).   Renaissance's current corporate structure automatically obligates Renaissance  to the obligations of Pinnacle and the resulting exposure under the two  contracts.   Combined exposure for these entities is $13MM USD.  A credit  review on Renaissance will be conducted within the next week.  5)  Devon Energy Corporation acquired Northstar Energy Corporation in  December 1998.  Northstar continues to operate as a wholly owned subsidiary,  has an executed Master Physical, and it has MACd on each of its covenants.   There is approximately $9.3MM USD mark to market exposure with Northstar.   Northstar has had several counterparties request a parent guaranty, but has  not offered any to date.  Devon offers limited financial information on its  Canadian operations in its 10-K, but exclusive Northstar data is not  provided.  We have sent Northstar our preferred form of guaranty, and they  have been unresponsive to subsequent phone calls.

All's pretty well here in DC with the  family...actually the family will be expanding...we're expecting another baby  in early August.    I'm glad you got in touch...I had an update to do for you anyway based on  recent events.  The Senate is moving forward with their bankruptcy legislation, and it will  likely pass today or tomorrow.  The Senate bill will include our technical  correction on production payments, but will not include any DOI language  (which is good) or our derivatives changes (which is not the best result, but  OK).   Based on conversations on Capitol Hill and with industry folks, the  best place to do our amendments would be in the conference committee that  will reconcile the differing House and Senate versions of the bill.    According to most sources, the House folks have a much better handle on the  financial contracts/derivatives issues and they will take the lead in making  some technical changes to that title in conference.  The Senate provisions on  financial contracts are considered more of a ""placeholder.""  I met yesterday with counsel to the House Judiciary Committee and she was  fairly receptive to our ideas.  Again...and we've found this all along...they  want the President's Working Group sign off, as well as the OK of other key  industry groups (ISDA, Bond Market Association) before they accept anything  as a ""non-controversial"" technical fix.   The Bond Market folks have already  presented a package of non-controversial technical corrections for inclusion  in conference, and I think they would be amendable to adding our changes to  their package.    Because we need to get PWG sign-off, we're in the position of probably being  successful on adding ""weather derivatives"" to the definition of swap  agreement, and on our changes to the netting provisions...but we're still  left hanging on our suggested change to the word ""regularly.""  I've talked to Ellen about possible other ways of tackling the ""regularly""  problem, but there does not seem to be a way to cover a ""one off"" transaction  unless without getting rid of the ""regularly"" requirement.  I'll continue to  see if there are other suggested approaches.   In meeting earlier this year  at Treasury with Mark Haedicke, Assistant Secretary Lee Sachs indicated they  would be amendable to talking about other ways of solving the ""regularly""  problem, so the lines of communciation are open.  We just need to decide  quickly whether to give up on this issue, or come up with a palatable  solution.  On another topic, I met with staff of the House Banking Committee, who have  been waiting to see the fate of the bankruptcy bill before moving legislation  that amends the banking statutes on netting and other derivatives issues, but  also includes bankruptcy language.  I wanted to make sure that they are aware  of our suggested amendments, so that any efforts out there....bankruptcy  legislation, banking legislation....are consistent.      Perhaps a conference call with you, me and Ellen (and Lech) is in order to  figure out where we go next.   How does Friday (the 4th) work for everyone?

"Carol:  I'm glad you've identified these specific line items.  I think credit  should have a ""separate worksheet"" and make a determination for each question  you've listed.  For exampe, I think the GP should be a Specified Entity.  One  issue I've experienced with credit is the existence of several LPs in a given  structure, only one of which owns any operating assets, and there are no  financials for that LP, but only financials on a consolidated basis at a  different level.  How does credit identify the counterparty, much less  determine if that counterparty is an ESP?  I also wonder how many partnerships we have agreements with which may be  inadequate.  And, when credit approves omnibus Transactions with a  partnership, is it making a sufficient analysis?  A separate list would help  in the evaluation.  Are we going to have another credit lunch?

As we discussed last week, the draft is designed to be relatively simple and ""user friendly,"" accommodating a single Enron entity and a single counterparty  entity engaged in cash settled and physically settled transactions under separate, pre-existing, respective financial and physical master agreements similar to those which you have provided to us as examples.  We note a few points about the attached draft:  1.   The terms ""master netting agreement"" and ""master netting agreement participants"" in Section 6 refer to proposed definitions that would be added  to the Bankruptcy Code upon enactment of the pending legislation. If an agreement is executed with a counterparty prior to enactment (or if the legislation is  not enacted), we would amend this provision to incorporate instead the existing  safe harbor provisions to the extent possible.  2.  We designated Texas law as the governing law (in brackets) based on the provisions of the ISDA schedule you provided to us.  3.  Notwithstanding that the draft contemplates a single Enron entity, we included references to Enron affiliates in certain provisions to provide flexibility in the event that obligations from other Enron entities to the counterparty should arise in any other context. We think that all such obligations should be available for setoff against Enron's claims against the counterparty.  Please call us when you have had an opportunity to review the draft.

I hope you are doing well.  I took a guess at your  E-mail address based upon all of the others I have for your ENA Legal  compatriots, so hopefully this will get through to your desktop.  One of my partners, Warren Ingber, has been asked to pick up on some work  that Kevin Leitao was handling for Western Resources involving a  trading  contract between ENA and Western Resources.  As I think you know, Kevin  recently left us to take a position with GE Capital.  Warren asked me if the  conflict waiver had been cleared with ENA and that is the reason for my  E-mail.  Warren informed me that the draft that had been forwarded to him had  indirectly come from Jeff Sorenson and that you were copied on the  correspondence.  In a number of cases in the past involving these types of contracts, ENA has  granted us waivers to represent the particular ENA counterparty.  I think the  general consensus was that ENA would rather have us represent the  counterparty, rather than another outside firm, since Kevin in particular had  been working with various ENA lawyers on a number of the issues that  frequently arise under these agreements and that it was more efficient (and  beneficial to the overall transaction) to work with a firm that had  familiarity both with respect to the issues as well as ENA's general views on  them.  Also, it is my understanding that the provisions are somewhat well  accepted and that it is unusual for there to be difficult legal  negotiations.  I know that Kevin had from time to time cleared these  representations on a case by case basis with the various ENA lawyers involved  (for e.g., I know there were one or more transactions in which Shari and Sara  were involved) and would let me know how we were proceeding.  My memory is  failing me on this one, although I seem to recall that the conflict had been  waived a while ago.  However, I just want to make sure that that was in fact  done in this case.  Could you let me know if my recollection is accurate or if you foresee any  problem in this respect.  Our contact at Western Resources said he understood  the conflict matter had been dealt with a while ago.  Obviously, we do not  want to take on a representation of this nature without ENA's consent.  I will be out of the office during the early part of the week, but I will be  checking E-mail and voice mail regularly.  My phone number is 212 424-8125.   Thanks again, Carol.

"David: Here is the extent to what I think we can agree to:  1. At the end of Section 4(b) we can say ""unless such access, entry, omission  or action arises from acts or omissions of Enron and its directors, officers,  employees, agents or contractors''.  What this does is not make them  responsible for losses we incur as a result of our own actions.  To the  extent that we suffer losses because of a third party claim brought against  us and such claim is not as a result of actions on our part, their indemnity  should cover this.  2.

"Rod: Fred has requested that we send him a draft ISDA with a zero threshold for an  affiliate of KCS Energy.  He also requested that we amend the setoff language  in the KCS ISDA Master to include this affiliate and KCS Resources.  As you  know, Lisa has been working with KCS' counsel to come up with a pleading that  would be approved by the bankruptcy judge in the KCS Energy bankruptcy matter  that would give us the protection that we need to do short term trades with  KCS while they are in bankruptcy.  KCS' counsel has been very slow to respond  and it wasn't until late last week that we received from feedback from them  which Lisa will be reviewing.  We are perplexed by Fred's latest request and  want to know what we should be doing in response to his request.  As you  know, amending the setoff language to include affiliates is not the same as  entering into a ""master netting agreement"" with KCS or their affiliates.  We have also received a request from Susan Wood in risk management who was  interested in finding out more about trading with ""bankrupt"" counterparties.   She said that she was working with Fred on this.  Again, is this something  that credit intends to pursue and if so, under what circumstances?  Both of the above matters will involve a considerable amount of time and  effort on legals part and before we spent alot of time on it, we wanted some  indication from credit that these matters were worth pursuing.

"Alicia and Trina: Here are my thoughts on the latest drafts of the swap docs:  Put Confirm  1. Looks like some type of price protection mechanism is contemplated in the  Master Derivatives Agreement and I'm assuming it would go into this confirm 2. In the definitions of ISDA and Equity Definitions, please add amendments  and supplements  Harrier/Talon Schedule  1. We need to discuss footnotes 2, 3, 6, 9, 12, 13 2. I think that the mechanics for putting up the LC that is described in the  Additional Termination Event that was added as clause (iv) needs to be  drafted somewhere to address, for example, drawing conditions, what happens  when Enron's credit rating improves, the comment made in footnote 6 etc.  3. In Part 4, Section (a) and in all of the notice sections the notice that  goes to the AGC of the Trading Group goes to Enron North America Corp. not  Enron Corp.  4. In Part 5, Section (l)(Recording) please add after the word ""parties"" the  phrase ""in connection with the Transactions hereunder."" 5. In Part 5, Section (o) (Confidentiality), is the class of permitted  discloses in clause (iv) too broad?   Talon/Enron Schedule  1. In Part 1, Section (h) should a carve out from the definition of  Identified Event be the new Termination Event that was added? 2. Why is Part 5, Section (n) in this Schedule? 3. Same comments as above  Master Derivatives Agreement  1. Is the defined term Net Premiums worded right for purposes of the  $400,000,000 limitation?  For some reason, I'm thinking that a and b should  be reversed.  Talon Note  1. In Section 3.2, I'm not sure that the reference in the second paragraph to  Part 5(m)(i) of the Enron Schedule applies since the setoff rights only  benefit Enron and its affiliates.  Also,  what does it mean to refer to the  Enron Guaranty here?  Enron Guaranty  1. In Section 4, I think that it is fair for them to request that setoff only  apply to the Guaranteed Agreements and unless I'm missing something, I think  we can give on that point.  That's all that I have.  Have you discussed with Ben the point that we talked  about last week concerning the difference between the calculation of ""Net  Talon Loss"" versus ""Loss""?

"Carol,  Per our conversation earlier regarding American Central Energy, LLC, I spoke  to Dan Fry at the counterparty and feel the following steps can be taken with  the current ISDA.  I feel it is not necessary to terminate the contract at  this point, as they are in negotiations to receive another parent guaranty  from a new majority owner.  I do feel it necessary though if a letter can be  drafted stating that the cancellation of their guaranty is an Event of  Default thus reducing their threshold to zero enabling Enron to margin any  exposure that exists.  Also, as we discussed, the letter should explain that  the guaranty is still in effect up until 5 days after notice of cancellation.  Please let me know any comments you may have.

We would like to make sure that our definition of confidential information is expanded to include our ""cleaned"" historical weather data (""Weather Data""), weather-risk internet application (""Web Site""), associated methodologies, user identification codes, and passwords.  2.  The purpose of the disclosure of RMS confidential information would be to enhance Enron's understanding of RMS technology and services and their uses within the marketplace.  3.  Enron is granted by RMS, a non-exclusive, non-transferable license to use the Weather Data for internal evaluation purposes only.  Enron agrees that it will not modify, create derivative works of, or distribute the Weather Data to any third party.  4.  Enron agrees to provide RMS with its comments, criticisms, and suggestions for changes with respect to the Weather Data and Web Site, including identifying any errors or malfunctions in the operation thereof.  If you can include these items into the new confidentiality agreement (based on the one the parties executed a year ago), we would be agreeable to signing it.  Also, our CEO and CFO will be traveling next week.

They  are still insisting on a exclusion of ""consequential losses"" from the  indemnity given clause 4(a) of the ETA. Two questions  Do we have a position on agreeing to exclude consquential losses from this  clause? My own view is in this instance it is going to be somewhat ""hit and  miss"" as what would be a consequential loss and what is not. That being said  the general Enron position is to exclude consequential losses. In fact such a  provision is already in the GTCs in respect of any Transaction.  Hence if  there was a Transaction consequentiallossess would then presumably be  excluded in respect of a related breach of the ETA.   Utilicorp is a substantial equity holder in United Energy.

David Minns 04/11/2000 03:01 PM To: ""Creek, Peggy"" <pcreek@ue.com.au> @ ENRON cc: Paul Smith/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT   Subject: Re: EnronOnline    Peggy my apologies for not replying sooner but I was overseas.  Let me  respond to the points you raised.  Deemed ISDA Agreement- We would be most happy to provide a letter that you  could aknowledge that the Deemed ISDA Agreement is a master agreement for the  purposes of the ETA. I would prefer not to make a formal amendment as this  may exclude a subsequent Master Agreement from applying. Enron Australia Finance Pty Ltd. is the Enron counterparty for all Australian  power trades. If that is your preference then access can be limited to only  those products. You could write to us stating this is your position. However,  we have found that counterparties have not found this necessary. Your  EnronOnline Master User will set access levels for your individual traders.  Many counterparties appoint a person from their Controls group (not a Trader)  as their Master User.   This gives them the flexibility to broaden/ reduce  access themselves. Excluding ""consequential loss"" in this circumstance is quite broad but if we  could work through some scenarios hopefully we could find some words to  accomodate your concerns. When we last spoke you mentioned the concern here was the possibility that   the password may be disclosed from other than a UE source ie Enron. I have  talked this issue through with our systems people as to the nature of this  exposure. What happens is that the password which is issued to a user is  immediately changed after it is received from Enron. Hence the source of the  password must be the relevant counterparty. Whether improper use is a result  of the counterparty's negilence or some other cause such as an unauthorised  use or disclosure by one of its personnel is not relevant.

Enron sends a letter to UE to be countersigned.  This letter covers the following:  * it is a variation to the ETA; * all Transactions entered through EnronOnline will be covered by the Deemed ISDA Master Agreement signed between UE and Enron Australia Finance and dated 8th Feb 1999; * Transactions at this stage will only be between UE and Enron Australia Finance; * amend clause 4(b) to exclude indemnification against consequential loss; * amend clause 4(b)(ii) of the ETA to remove the wording ""whether or not Counterparty has authorized such access"" and provide appropriate replacement wording that ensures UE is only liable where access is obtained through UE's negligence.  Please let me know if Enron would agree to this.  Regards Peggy         ",mark.taylor@enron.com,carol.clair@enron.com,Re: EnronOnline,2000-04-17 11:17:00-07:00,sent

"Adele: Here are my thoughts on the latest drafts of the ISDA and CSA Schedules that  you sent to me:  1. In Part 1, Section (e) of the ISDA Schedule, right after the definition of  PSE&G Reorganization Transaction you need to delete ""S&P"".  I also need to  see what you are planning to put on Annex C.  2. I am checking with my credit person regarding the language that you added  to Part 5, Section (h) - Transfer.  3. In the CSA, I thought that both threshold amounts were to be at  $7,500,000.  In addition, in the proviso after threshold, the term ""Specified  Condition"" should be changed to ""Material Adverse Change"".  A Mac would be  triggered if Credit Ratings were below BBB-.  4. In Paragraph 13, Section (e), if the only types of collateral are cash or  LC's why is consent required to substitute?  5. I would like to discuss with you our proposed Insert 4 to Paragraph 13,  Section (h)(iii).  6. In Paragraph 13, Section (j)(ii)(2), why was the last sentence deleted?  7. I need to discuss with you just a few issues on the LC provisions.  I will  send you a mark-up with my thoughts and questions.  Hopefully we can get this resolved next week.  Tuesday through Thursday of  next week work best for me. I will fax to you a mark-up with my nits and  comments on the lC language.

"Suzanne: Could you please call this guy and let him know that I am out of the office  today and that I will call him sometime tomorrow.  Also, thanks for your  message.  My doctor needs to wait until he gets the other doctor's report  before we can talk so probably nothing will happen until Wednesday morning  when I see him.  All I can do know is take it easy and try not to think about  what might happen.  There's not much I can do and the only way that I will  know that there is a problem is if I start bleeding.  The baby is fine.  He's  almost 3 pounds and Arthur got to see him today which was great!  Needless to  say, no more running nad unfortunately for Bill no more sex!  The one funny  thing that happened was when the doctor was trying to tell us that we could  not have sex and she didn't want to use the word sex because Arthur was there  so she used the word ""relations"".  Bill couldn't understand  what she was  saying and I know you had to be there but I just cracked up.  I also had a  good laugh when the doctor found out that I was a runner.  She looked me  right in the eye and said ""no more running"" which is what I expected.  Again,  you had to be there!  Anyway, barring no further problems, I'll be in tomorrow and we'll just take  it one day at a time.

"Jeff: Janice and I have been working on a deal with Fred LaGrasta that involves  entering into a Crude Oil Purchase Agreement.  Their lawyer has come back  with the following requests which Janice has asked me to run by you:  1. They want to delete the arbitration provision or at the very least delete  the waiver of the right to recover attorneys fees.  They claim that this  conflicts with an indemnity clause in the agreement for non-performance which  allows for recovery of attorneys fees.  2. They want to delete  subsection (e) of the submission to jurisdiction  clause which contains a waiver of the right to claim immunity from suit,  execution, attachment or other legal process.  Can we give on these points?  They owe us back payments on financial swaps  that we have done with them and the purpose of entering into this Purchase  Agreement is to be able to offset what they owe us under the swaps with what  we owe them for the crude that we purchase.  It's a long story as to how we  ended up here but suffice it to say that this is our only hope of getting  them to recognize the swaps and honor their obligations under the swaps so if  there is any way taht we can accommodate their requests to get the deal done,  that would be great.

"Rod: Here are their credit issues:  1. In the cross-default language that want to add language that basically  says that even if a cross-default occurs, unless the Non-Defaulting  determines in good faith that performance by the Defaulting Party of its  obligations under the Master is ""endangered"", then no cross default is  triggered.  2. In Credit Event Upon Merger we had commented that instaed of the  ""materially weaker"" standard we wanted to specify that it meant being rated  below BBB- by S&P.  Do you feel strongly about this?  Alos, we usually have  language that says that if an event like merger occurs and the transferee  provides collateral to the other party in an amount that is satisfactory to  such party, then a Credit Event Upon Merger is not triggered.  They did not  want to add this carve-out.  Are you okay with this?  3. They want a separate Event of Default that gets triggered if a MAC (below  BBB-) occurs.  We requested that it be out in the collateral threshold  language.  4. They are saying that for ""operational"" purposes, they cannot agree to  ""netting"".  5. They want as a category of Eligible Collateral governmental securities  with a maturity of less than 1 year, valued at 98%.  6. In the CSA, if a dispute occurs with respect to either the calculation of  Exposure or the calculation of the value of any colateral in connection with  a party's request either for the transfer or return of collateral, normally  the following procedures apply:  a. the disputing party notifies the other party of the nature of the dispute  by the close of business on the day following the day that the collateral  request was made.  b. the undisputed amount is transferred to the party making the request  c. the parties attempt to resolve the dispute by the ""Resolution Time"" and if  a resolution is not reached, a recalculation of the Exposure is made and  market quotations have to be obtained.  We normally say that the Resolution Time is 3 Business Days after the dispute  notice is given.  DB wants to shorten this period to 1 Business Day after the  dispute notice is given which gives the parties less time to resolve the  dispute on their own.  What do you think?  7. If a party holds cash as collateral, we normally say that interest earned  is transferred on the first day of the month.  They want to change first to  last.  Let me know what you think.  I was hoping that some of these you could  resolve with your counterpart at DB.  Carol  ",rod.nelson@enron.com,carol.clair@enron.com,Deutsche Bank,2000-04-26 09:41:00-07:00,sent

We will agree to $100,000,00 for both parties  3. It is Enron's Policy to use Loss instead of Market Quotation, which I  believe is the standard that is currently used in the existing Master.  As a  compromise, we can agree to Market Quotation for Transactions with a term of  2 years or less as of the applicable termination date and Loss for all others.  4. Item #4 is fine.  5. Our credit people want to keep MAC where it is as a trigger that reduces  the collateral threshold to zero.  6. I would like to discuss with you what we are doing with the existing  Guarantys.  7. Item #7 is okay but we would prefer a separate termination agreement.  8. I need to discuss with you items #8 and 10     CSA COMMENTS  1. Item #1 is fine  2. We cannot agree to item #2 and would like for it to remain at 20  3.

Item #1 is fine  2.   We will agree to $100,000,00 for both parties  3.   It is Enron's Policy to use Loss instead of Market Quotation, which I- believe is the standard that is currently used in the existing Master.  As a compromise, we can agree to Market Quotation for Transactions with a term of 2 years or less as of the applicable termination date and Loss for all others.  4.   Item #4 is fine.  5.   Our credit people want to keep MAC where it is as a trigger that reduces the collateral threshold to zero.  6.   I would like to discuss with you what we are doing with the existing Guarantys.  7.   Item #7 is okay but we would prefer a separate termination agreement.  8.   I need to discuss with you items #8 and 10  CSA COMMENTS  1.   Item #1 is fine  2.   We cannot agree to item #2 and would like for it to remain at 20  3.   I would like to discuss item #3 with you  Also, some of the changes that were made were not marked (i.e., no fault termination was not in our draft, but in yours).  Could you please e-mail me your latest versions so that I can make sure that I have seen all of the changes?  With respect to no-fault termination, we cannot as a policy matter agree to that.

We can accept your proposed new language with the following chnages:  1.   From our language in the ETA, we need to keep in the provisions regarding treble, exemplary and punitive damages.  This is Enron's current policy.  I ASSUME YOU ARE REFERRING TO THE SENTENCE:  ""ONLY DAMAGES ALLOWED PURSUANT TO THIS AGREEMENT MAY BE AWARDED AND THE ARBITRATORS SHALL HAVE NO AUTHORITY TO AWARD TREBLE, EXEMPLARY OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES OF ANY KIND UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES REGARDLESS OF WHETHER SUCH DAMAGES MAY BE AVAILABLE UNDER THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK AND/OR THE FAA OR AAA.""  THIS IS OK AND CAN BE INCLUDED IN MY SUGGESTED DISPUTE LANGUAGE IN THE PARAGRAPH THAT ADDRESSES REMEDIES.  2.   In the first paragraph of your language, we would like to delete the last sentence.  THIS IS OK.  3.   With respect to the selection of the arbitrators, we would like to keep our language that each party can select 1.  We have no problem going with your language on selecting the third from a list.  THIS IS OK.  4.   We cannot agree that monetary damages are the exclusive remedy.  How would we enforce the confidentiality provisions?   We need some other way to be able to seek non-monetary remedies for those types of breaches.  THIS MAY BE OUR ONLY STICKING POINT.    GENERALLY SPEAKING, THE APPROPRIATE REMEDY FOR A BREACH OF CONTRACT CLAIM IS A MONETARY REMEDY.  IN A BREACH OF CONTRACT CLAIM AGAINST THE U.S., THE U.S. COURT OF FEDERAL CLAIMS HAS JURISDICTION (28 U.S.C. 1491).  SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE IS NOT A REMEDY AVAILABLE AGAINST THE UNITED STATES BECAUSE SOVEREIGN IMMUNITY HAS NOT BEEN WAIVED FOR SUCH RELIEF.  [I DO NOTE THAT YOU DID NOT OBJECT TO THIS LANGUAGE IN MY PROPOSED DISPUTE LANGUAGE SO I ASSUME YOU MAY ALREADY RECOGNIZE THAT FACT.] SIMILARLY, THERE IS NO GENERAL JURISDICTION FOR THE U.S. COURT OF FEDERAL CLAIMS TO GRANT INJUNCTIVE RELIEF IN BREACH OF CONTRACT CASES.  BONNEVILLE IS NOT AMENABLE TO (NOR MAY IT BE LEGALLY AUTHORIZED TO) ENTER INTO CONTRACTS THAT WOULD PROVIDE ARBITRATORS WITH AUTHORITY BEYOND THAT WHICH CONGRESS INTENDED TO BE APPLICABLE TO FEDERAL AGENCIES.  I CANNOT ASCERTAIN FROM YOUR COMMENT WHETHER YOUR CONCERN IS THE FACT THAT BONNEVILLE IS A FEDERAL AGENCY AND SUBJECT TO THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT.  IF THAT IS YOUR CONCERN, I WOULD LIKE TO OFFER LANGUAGE THAT COULD BE ADDED TO YOUR CONFIDENTIALITY PROVISION THAT MAY PROVIDE A GREATER LEVEL OF COMFORT THAT INFORMATION THAT ENRON DEEMS CONFIDENTIAL IS NOT DISCLOSED WITHOUT AN OPPORTUNITY FOR ENRON TO RESPOND:  ""SUBJECT TO BONNEVILLE'S OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT (5 U.S.C. 552, AS AMENDED), THE PRIVACY ACT OF 1974 (5 U.S.C. 552a), THE TRADE SECRETS ACT OF 1988 (18 U.S.C. 1905), AND ANY OTHER APPLICABLE FEDERAL LAWS, BONNEVILLE SHALL TREAT AS EXEMPT FROM PUBLIC DISCLOSURE ANY TRADE SECRETS AND COMMERCIAL OR FINANCIAL INFORMATION FURNISHED PURSUANT TO THIS AGREEMENT PROVIDED THAT IT IS PRIVILEGED OR CONFIDENTIAL AND IS SO DESIGNATED BY ENRON.

"Joe, Jeff an Bob: Here is a summary of those counterparties that have had specific objections  to our new form of Annex A:  1. Sithe Energy - wants New York law to apply  2. Voest-Alpine Intertrading USA, Inc. - won't agree to the setoff  language.   Credit should be consulted prior to any further trades to see if  they are okay with this given our relationships with this entity.  3. Madison Gas & Electric - will not agree to the ""or otherwise"" language in  the setoff language.  Again, this is a credit issue.  4. Cargill - wouldn't review the new language because we are close to getting  a master in place with them.  Sara expects this to happen in the next few  days.  5. Idacorp Energy Solutions, L.P. -  same as Cargill.  I am working on this  one and their attorney owes me a response.  This one may take a few weeks.  6. Formosa Plastics - this is the counterparty that sent the threatening  letter.  It didn't appear from our records that we have traded financial  derivatives with them recently.  7. General Electric Company - won't accept the chnages and have failed to  tell me specifically what they object to.  I will continue to follow up with  their attorney.  8. Basin Exploration, Inc. - same as General Electric.  9. TransMontaigne Product services Inc. - sent letter out on March 30 saying  they would respond in 30 days and I have never heard back from them.  I will  follow up with their attorney.  10. Reliant - they didn't accept the new language that we added as clause (z)  to Section 3(e) and wanted to deal with this differently in the confirmation  as a trigger that would give us the right to call for collateral.  Credit  should be alerted.  11. Devon Energy - they had in the past requested more time to review Annex A  and when I followed up with them last week, they still didn't have a response.  12. Smurfit - Stone Container - same as Devon energy.  13. Public Service Gas & Electric Company - we are close to finalizing an  ISDA with them.  If we do any trades with them before one is signed they have  requested chnages in few areas to match what we have agreed to in the iSDA  negotiations.  I can prepare a mark-up.

THIS IS OK AND CAN BE INCLUDED IN MY SUGGESTED DISPUTE LANGUAGE IN THE PARAGRAPH THAT ADDRESSES REMEDIES.  2.   In the first paragraph of your language, we would like to delete the last sentence.  THIS IS OK.  3.   With respect to the selection of the arbitrators, we would like to keep our language that each party can select 1.  We have no problem going with your language on selecting the third from a list.  THIS IS OK.  4.   We cannot agree that monetary damages are the exclusive remedy.  How would we enforce the confidentiality provisions?   We need some other way to be able to seek non-monetary remedies for those types of breaches.  THIS MAY BE OUR ONLY STICKING POINT.    GENERALLY SPEAKING, THE APPROPRIATE REMEDY FOR A BREACH OF CONTRACT CLAIM IS A MONETARY REMEDY.  IN A BREACH OF CONTRACT CLAIM AGAINST THE U.S., THE U.S. COURT OF FEDERAL CLAIMS HAS JURISDICTION (28 U.S.C. 1491).  SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE IS NOT A REMEDY AVAILABLE AGAINST THE UNITED STATES BECAUSE SOVEREIGN IMMUNITY HAS NOT BEEN WAIVED FOR SUCH RELIEF.  [I DO NOTE THAT YOU DID NOT OBJECT TO THIS LANGUAGE IN MY PROPOSED DISPUTE LANGUAGE SO I ASSUME YOU MAY ALREADY RECOGNIZE THAT FACT.] SIMILARLY, THERE IS NO GENERAL JURISDICTION FOR THE U.S. COURT OF FEDERAL CLAIMS TO GRANT INJUNCTIVE RELIEF IN BREACH OF CONTRACT CASES.  BONNEVILLE IS NOT AMENABLE TO (NOR MAY IT BE LEGALLY AUTHORIZED TO) ENTER INTO CONTRACTS THAT WOULD PROVIDE ARBITRATORS WITH AUTHORITY BEYOND THAT WHICH CONGRESS INTENDED TO BE APPLICABLE TO FEDERAL AGENCIES.  I CANNOT ASCERTAIN FROM YOUR COMMENT WHETHER YOUR CONCERN IS THE FACT THAT BONNEVILLE IS A FEDERAL AGENCY AND SUBJECT TO THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT.  IF THAT IS YOUR CONCERN, I WOULD LIKE TO OFFER LANGUAGE THAT COULD BE ADDED TO YOUR CONFIDENTIALITY PROVISION THAT MAY PROVIDE A GREATER LEVEL OF COMFORT THAT INFORMATION THAT ENRON DEEMS CONFIDENTIAL IS NOT DISCLOSED WITHOUT AN OPPORTUNITY FOR ENRON TO RESPOND:  ""SUBJECT TO BONNEVILLE'S OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT (5 U.S.C. 552, AS AMENDED), THE PRIVACY ACT OF 1974 (5 U.S.C. 552a), THE TRADE SECRETS ACT OF 1988 (18 U.S.C. 1905), AND ANY OTHER APPLICABLE FEDERAL LAWS, BONNEVILLE SHALL TREAT AS EXEMPT FROM PUBLIC DISCLOSURE ANY TRADE SECRETS AND COMMERCIAL OR FINANCIAL INFORMATION FURNISHED PURSUANT TO THIS AGREEMENT PROVIDED THAT IT IS PRIVILEGED OR CONFIDENTIAL AND IS SO DESIGNATED BY ENRON.  IN THE EVENT A THIRD PARTY SEEKS DISCLOSURE OF SUCH INFORMATION UNDER ANY APPLICABLE FEDERAL LAW, BONNEVILLE SHALL PROMPTLY NOTIFY ENRON OF SUCH EFFORT, AND ANY OPPORTUNITIES FOR ENRON TO PROTEST SUCH DISCLOSURE.

In the financial reporting section, they want to add on our side a  requirement that we deliver to them any financial or business report that we  make available to our shareholders or that we file with the SEC or bank  regulatory authorities  5.

In the cross-default language that want to add language that basically  says that even if a cross-default occurs, unless the Non-Defaulting  determines in good faith that performance by the Defaulting Party of its  obligations under the Master is ""endangered"", then no cross default is  triggered.  2. In Credit Event Upon Merger we had commented that instaed of the  ""materially weaker"" standard we wanted to specify that it meant being rated  below BBB- by S&P.  Do you feel strongly about this?  Alos, we usually have  language that says that if an event like merger occurs and the transferee  provides collateral to the other party in an amount that is satisfactory to  such party, then a Credit Event Upon Merger is not triggered.  They did not  want to add this carve-out.  Are you okay with this?  3. They want a separate Event of Default that gets triggered if a MAC (below  BBB-) occurs.  We requested that it be out in the collateral threshold  language.  4. They are saying that for ""operational"" purposes, they cannot agree to  ""netting"".  5. They want as a category of Eligible Collateral governmental securities  with a maturity of less than 1 year, valued at 98%.  6. In the CSA, if a dispute occurs with respect to either the calculation of  Exposure or the calculation of the value of any colateral in connection with  a party's request either for the transfer or return of collateral, normally  the following procedures apply:  a. the disputing party notifies the other party of the nature of the dispute  by the close of business on the day following the day that the collateral  request was made.  b. the undisputed amount is transferred to the party making the request  c. the parties attempt to resolve the dispute by the ""Resolution Time"" and if  a resolution is not reached, a recalculation of the Exposure is made and  market quotations have to be obtained.  We normally say that the Resolution Time is 3 Business Days after the dispute  notice is given.  DB wants to shorten this period to 1 Business Day after the  dispute notice is given which gives the parties less time to resolve the  dispute on their own.  What do you think?  7. If a party holds cash as collateral, we normally say that interest earned  is transferred on the first day of the month.  They want to change first to  last.  Let me know what you think.  I was hoping that some of these you could  resolve with your counterpart at DB.

We currently have a Master dated July 1997 between  ECC and Pancanadian Petroleum Limited and Pancanadian wants to pretty much  duplicate this Master.  Here are the credit terms of the late 1998 drfat that  we sent them which I need for you to tell me are still okay:   No Credit Support Providers Cross Default - $50,000,000 for ENA and $25,000,000 for them Additional Event of Default - occurrence of a MAC and the failure to provide  Perfprmance Assurance in accordnace with annex A.  MAC is defined as   Enron's rating going below BBB- and their Net Worth falling below  $133,000,000 opr their Funded Debt to Net Worth being more than 1 to 1 They want to defined the ""control"" concept in Affiliate as ownership of more  than 50% of equity.  This term is used in the Setoff language and limits the  possible  entities that could be Affiliates on our side and their side Forms of collateral are cash and LC's Collateral Thresholds are $10,000,000 for us and $3,500,000 for them  Let me know what you think.

Physical trades in US will be with Enron NA other than in Texas where       is will be Houston Pipeline Company(please can you clarify this aspect       for gas moving out of Texas on interstate pipelines)       Physical trades in Canada will be with Enron Canada   The first sentence is correct.  Physical NATURAL GAS trades in US will be  with Enron North America for locations  outside of Texas and Houston Pipeline  Company for locations within Texas.  Physical NATURAL GAS trades in Canada   can be with either Enron North America or Enron Canada Corp, depending on the  location.       3.All financial deals will be governed by the cargill/Enron ISDA      agreement presently being negotiated    Once executed, the ISDA signed be Cargill and Enron will govern any  financial trades entered into by the   entities that signed this agreement.         4.Physical deals will be governed by the executed GISB agreement in      place    Physical NATURAL GAS deals, entered into by the entities that executed a  GISB agreement, will be governed by  said agreement.         5.Cargill will need to have two accounts to differentiate Cargill Inc      from Cargill Canada   Yes         Given the above summary, Cargill will look to set up two accounts as      per (5) above, to commence trading with Enron-online.

"Frank: I have sent your responses to Stacy Dickson and Jeff Hodge so that they can  verify the physical questions.  With respect to question #3, I would alos  state that until the Master is executed, all of those trades will be governed  by the online GTC.  Also, to the extent that Cargill traded with Enron Canada  on a financial basis, those trades would alos be confirmed under the Master  as it is my understanding taht we do not do separate Masters with the same  counterparty for ENA and ECC.

"Rod: I found my file and here is where things stand:  1. On cross default threshold, they wanted it to be the same as the  collateral threshold but my notes indicate that they were okay leaving it at  $100,000.  2. In lieu of receiving financials from them, we had agreed to accept  quarterly and annual Lease Operating Statements.  Did I use the correct  term?  Do we need a definition for this or is it understood what these  statements are?  I am also assuming that they are internally prepared.  Is  that correct?  My notes indicate that these would be provided within 90 days  after quarter end.  3. We agreed to a collateral threshold for them of $500,000.  4.  For the MAC trigger, is the only test the Net Cash Flow/Revenue test and  if so, what would trigger the MAC?  Are there other triggers?  We used to  have Funded Debt/Partners Capital, EBITDA Coverage Ratio and Minimum Partners  Capital tests.  Alos, here are my proposed definitions:  Cash Flow means Net Income plus depreciation and non-cash charges minus  capital expenditures as shown on the income statement.  Net Income means gross revenues and other proper income credits, less all  proper income charges, including taxes on income.  Revenue is cash received from the sale of oil, gas and plant products.

"I agree with Leslie - and we need to be careful about names Affiliates, too.  Each Master User ID is intended for use by one legal entity. If the Affiliate  is just a trading name and is the same legal entity, then we are OK - but if  they are a separate legal entity, then we have problems with:  a) The ability of one entity to bind another b) Credit headroom allocations and netting between entities.  We should restrict the Master User ID and ETA to be applied to a single legal  entity only.

"John: I was reviewing an amendment that Susan bailey was working on concerning the  ISDA Master between ECC and Petro Canada and wanted to make sure that you  were comfortable leaving as is the following provisions that are in the  Schedules:  1. They have amended the definition of Specified Indebtedness.  I'm not sure  I understand  why if we have a threshold amount they need the first part of  the language and wanted your thoughts on this.  Alos, does the second part of  the language need to be updated or revised in any manner?  2. They have deleted the concept of Credit event Upon Merger.  3. They have added to Specified Transaction a Physical Master Agreement which  makes this part of the cross default to specified transaction Event of  Default trigger.  Should we specify a threshold?  4. They have added an additional termination event that contains some unusual  ratings triggers.  For example, are we rated by the 2 bond rating services  that they describe, and if not, doesn't that trigger clause (2) of this  additional Termination Event?   I don;'t think the cure language works and I  don't understand how it works with the collateral threshold since the trigger  for that to go to zero is something else.  5. I'll just note that setoff rights do not currently apply if there is a  Termination Event that is caused by Tax Event or Tax Event Upon Merger.  6. In the CSA, we have permitted cash and government securities which I think  is problematic given our general rule in Canada that we only take LC's.  7. There is a Minimum Transfer Amount of $500,000.  Please call me when convenient to discuss further.

"With regard to your questions, I have written my answers in red below:   1. In the EMU Protocol language they want to add a reference to Section 6.   I'm not sure why but wanted your thoughts on this.  Are there any  circumstances under which we do not adopt the Protocol provisions?  This is something that should be run by Paul Simons in London as our EMU  wording came straight from him. He would know what Section 6 refers to (I  don't) and whether we should agree to its inclusion.  2. They want to define the FX Definitions as the 1998 FX and Currency Option  Definitions as amended and supplemented by the 1998 ISDA Euro Definitions.   Is this okay?  What is the effect of this?  Should we change our form to do  this?  With respect generally to the FX and Currency Option Definitions, as a  general rule are they always incorporated by reference into the terms of any  FX and Currency Option transaction even if it is electronically confirmed?   They wanted to add language to that section of our form specifically stating  this.  I didn't even know that the 1998 ISDA Euro Definitions existed and I wonder  what the purpose is.  Seeing as how the 1998  FX and Currency Option  Definitions came out in 1998 (the same year as the Euro Definitions) one  would think that any necessary euro/FX/currency  language would have been  incorporated in the 1998 FX Definitions, instead of making a separate  definitional booklet.  You might ask Dresdner what they think it adds to make  reference to the 1998 ISDA Euro Definitions. You might also look on the ISDA  Website or ask Paul Simons (in case he knows)  to see if ISDA intended for  the 1998 ISDA Euro Definitions to supplement the 1998  FX and Currency Option  Definitions.   If we did include such a reference to the 1998 ISDA Euro Definitions, then  they would be deemed to apply to any FX or Currency Option Transaction, where  relevant.    With regard to electronically confirmed transactions, this point is addressed  in clause (a) of our FX language.  This wording is something everyone wants  to have in their Agreement since most FX trades and some Currency Option  trades are confirmed over an electronic messaging system that doesn't use  ISDA style confirms, and thus doesn't refer to any ISDA Definitions.

I anticipate having the ISDA Transfer and Termination Agreement executed within the week.

"Adele and Maria: Here are my final comments:  1. In the ISDA Schedule, Part 4, Section (f)(iii), we cannot accept a 30 day  waiting period.  Why can't the Guaranty be furnished when the Reorg becomes  effective?  2. In each Guaranty, there is an extra zero in the ""cap"" amount.  3. In the PSE&G Guaranty, the Counterparty notice section should be just like  what is in the Master for primary notices and copies.  4. In the LC, in the new language on the second page, change Uniform Customs  to UCP.  That's all I have.  Subject to resolving point #1, please e-mail to me the  Enron Guaranty and please coordinate with Susan Flynn on getting final  versions executed and obtaining other closing items.  I will review your  opinion shortly.

"Rob: I'll do my best to get back to you tomorrow although I still have not heard  from my credit person.  Other than the credit issue, I do want to talk to you  about the following:  1. Deletion of the Termination Event in Section (j)(c).  If we have to choose  between this and the covenant that you inserted in Part 5, I would much  rather have this but I don't understand why we can't have both.  2. In the new language that you added in the ""Recording"" section, I don't  think that I can agree to the reasonable expectation language unless we make  it clear here that it would be reasonable to expect that any call that is  made to or from our trading floor will be recorded.  Also, at the very  beginning where it says ""that originates from and"" the word ""and"" needs to be  ""or"" to cover the situation in our case where someone from your side that is  not on the trading floor calls our trading floor.  3. In Part 5, Section (o) the last sentence, please change the word ""herein""  to ""this Agreement"" and please change the last reference to ""the Existing  Transactions"" to ""this Agreement"" as I thought that this is what we agreed to.  4. In the definition of MAC, in clauses (a)(ii) and (b)(ii), please change  the word ""either"" to ""both"" and the word ""or"" to ""and"", as I thought this is  what we agreed to.  5. In the form of LC, our credit group has asked us to add language that  amends Section 13(b) of the UCP to shorten the time frame from 7 to 3 days  and I will fax that to you.

We will be rolling the Alchemy transaction into the Hawaii 125-0  structure.  We are not sure if the current structure will be unwound  completely and reconstituted into new entities in the Hawaii structure or if  the current Alchemy entities will be used.  Regardless, I'm fairly sure that  the original swap will be unwound and a new confirmation will be done using  the Hawaii Master Agreement.  We are hoping to close by May 31st.   2. Resco II/McGarret B - We are doing part two of the first transaction in  the Hawaii Structure.  EES has requested that we put additional warrants of  an entity they call Resco into the Hawaii structure.  This should close  around June 15th. I am sending Resco I/McGarret A documents for the 3/31  transaction to Sara today.  That is all we know about so far. Gareth is working on both of these deals.    Blackbird has been put on indefinite hold. I will keep you posted on any  other information I get about any transactions involving swaps.  Call if you need any more info.

In each Guaranty, there is an extra zero in the ""cap"" amount.  3.

Also included is a draft what should be in the L/C and Schedule 1 of a Stby L/C.  Please note that I have accepted most of the previous changes so the current issues would more easily be seen in the draft.  Comments concerning the schedule and para 13 are below:  Note - our legal council is out this week but I thought I would send this draft to you now, and we can make further adjustments, if any, based on our legal department review next week.  1.  Part 1 (e):  After Charles Hofer spoke with your Credit Manager, Brant Reves, they decided to make the cross default threshold at $100MM for each credit support provider. 2.  1(h):  Made change per our phone conversation that Market Quotation will apply for 3 years or less; Loss for over 3 years. 3.  5(g):  I am confused by this change.  I added back in the word ""obligations"" in para B, 5th line and added back in the phrase concerning affiliates.  I'm not sure my predecessor deleted them (it is not deleted on my 3/20/00 draft) but I can't imagine who else would.  Two comments (i) do you think this is best way to word this, and (2) my legal council (who is out most of this week) will have to review your final wording before we can execute. 4.  5(l):  Changed the telephone recording paragraph by (a) not limiting it to just trading staff and (b) adding ""to the extent permitted by applicable law"". 5.  5(n-q):  All new paragraphs that are not part of our standard agreement. However, these were not discussed in Susan's last memo to you (except the adding back in of paragraph q) so I am leaving them as is. 6.  Part 6:  After reviewing your changes vs. our standard paragraphs, I have no objections to your changes 7.  13(b)(i)(C) Accepted your definition of Credit Support Amount even though we don't normally use Independent Amounts. 8.  13(b)(iii)(A)  Letters of Credit - changes days to 20 from 10, per your request.  After re-reading, I don't understand how it improves the position of the secured party.  If the L/C has an expiration date and the secured party attempts to execute (i.e.: cash in) this L/C, then if the L/C is within 20 days of its expiration, the value can drop to zero.  Before, the L/C maintained 100% of its value until 10 days prior to expiration.  Since Enron looks at these contracts from the secured party perspective, how does your position improve based on this change? 8.  13(b)(iii)(B and C) Threshold for both of us has been increased to $50MM and Minimum Transfer Amount has been reduced to zero ($0).  For questions, please call at 713-420-3548 or email me.  Thanks!

Prior to the  departures of Shari, Lynda, et al, there was a move afoot to create an annex  of weather definitions which could be incorporated by reference into the  confirms (or added to the Schedule), either of which approaches would shorten  the confirms considerably.  Jarrod advises that the EOL T&C's for the  varioius weather products contain the basic information which can be drafted  in the annex.  Jarrod will send us the EOL T&C's.  I think it's a great idea.   Jarrod will also send the existing  weather templates (which may be slightly  different from those Shari gave us earlier).  We should verify that the  weather rep appears in the weather option templates (since we have agreed to  remove that rep from the Schedule).

Also included is a draft what should be in the L/C and Schedule 1 of a Stby L/C.  Please note that I have accepted most of the previous changes so the current issues would more easily be seen in the draft.  Comments concerning the schedule and para 13 are below:  Note - our legal council is out this week but I thought I would send this draft to you now, and we can make further adjustments, if any, based on our legal department review next week.  1.  Part 1 (e):  After Charles Hofer spoke with your Credit Manager, Brant Reves, they decided to make the cross default threshold at $100MM for each credit support provider. 2.  1(h):  Made change per our phone conversation that Market Quotation will apply for 3 years or less; Loss for over 3 years. 3.  5(g):  I am confused by this change.  I added back in the word ""obligations"" in para B, 5th line and added back in the phrase concerning affiliates.  I'm not sure my predecessor deleted them (it is not deleted on my 3/20/00 draft) but I can't imagine who else would.  Two comments (i) do you think this is best way to word this, and (2) my legal council (who is out most of this week) will have to review your final wording before we can execute. 4.  5(l):  Changed the telephone recording paragraph by (a) not limiting it to just trading staff and (b) adding ""to the extent permitted by applicable law"". 5.  5(n-q):  All new paragraphs that are not part of our standard agreement. However, these were not discussed in Susan's last memo to you (except the adding back in of paragraph q) so I am leaving them as is. 6.  Part 6:  After reviewing your changes vs. our standard paragraphs, I have no objections to your changes 7.  13(b)(i)(C) Accepted your definition of Credit Support Amount even though we don't normally use Independent Amounts. 8.  13(b)(iii)(A)  Letters of Credit - changes days to 20 from 10, per your request.  After re-reading, I don't understand how it improves the position of the secured party.  If the L/C has an expiration date and the secured party attempts to execute (i.e.: cash in) this L/C, then if the L/C is within 20 days of its expiration, the value can drop to zero.  Before, the L/C maintained 100% of its value until 10 days prior to expiration.  Since Enron looks at these contracts from the secured party perspective, how does your position improve based on this change? 8.  13(b)(iii)(B and C) Threshold for both of us has been increased to $50MM and Minimum Transfer Amount has been reduced to zero ($0).  For questions, please call at 713-420-3548 or email me.  Thanks!

After visiting with Scott about the reps and  warranties, he became concerned about the overall scope of the agreement and  in particular, what in addition to the URL domain name (weather-desk.com) EEL  was being asked to transfer and the restrictions that RMS wanted to place on  EEL with respect to this Domain Name and ""any variations thereof.""   We went  back to RMS and told them basically that all we were willing to do was  transfer them the URL domain name with no strings attached.  I'm not sure  that this will be acceptable to them given their future intentions which is  to acquire from another third party the name ""weatherdesk.com"" , register it  and use it with respect to the products that they offer.  All of these discussions that we have had over the past week with respect to  our domain name have lead Seth, Scott and I to question what Enron's intent  is with respect to the name or any variations thereof given the fact that  according to Scott we have submitted applications to register similar names.   We were hoping that you could help us answer this question or at least lead  us to the right people that could.  It seems odd that we would be wiling to  transfer this name and yet feel that it is important to pursue registering  these other names.  I look forward to hearing from you.

"Richard: In reviewing our ISDA forms we had the following questions for you with  respect to the arbitration and process agent language:  1. Do any changes need to be made to our arbitration language?  I have  enclosed what we currently use.  Also, should we keep in waiver of jury trial  even if arbitration is chosen for situations where the award needs to be  enforced in court?  Is it necessary to have a statement that the award can be  enforced in court?  2. We have assumed that there is no need to add our appointment of process  agent language if our counterparty is either organized in the US or Canada or  maintains a branch or office in the US or Canada.  Is this a correct  assumption?  Enclosed is our process agent language.  I look forward to hearing from you.

We have assumed that for all ISDA Masters where Canadian law applies, we  should not insert our arbitration provision.  Is this correct?  2. With respect to the Trade Option exemption and Eligible Swap Participant  reps that we normally insert in our form (which I have enclosed below), we  have assumed that the only time that these reps should not be inserted is  when the Master is between ECC and a Canadian or Foreign counterparty?

Once an Event of Default occurs, then we can elect an early Termination  Date.  The ""Loss: method applies here.  As I mentioned in my voice mail, we  need to coordinate closely with whoever will be doing the Loss calculation  (and it should not be Fred or someone in his group) to make sure that they  have the appropriate back up.

With respect to your Canadian securities rep, I am checking with our  counsel in Canada about whether we can use your language instaed of ours.  2. With respect to the Options rep and the ESP rep in part %, Section (b), I  believe that both parties need to make such reps.  The rep in Part 5  (b)(g)(ii) is to cover the Trade Option exemption and it is different from  the ESP rep below it.  3. With respect to the language in Part 5, Section (a), this is different  from the setoff language.    What this is saying is that if a party has  fulfilled all of its payment obligations and an Event of Default occurs with  respect to it (the ""Defaulting Party""), the other party cannot withhold any  payment that it owes to the Defaulting Party.  This is different from the  exercise of setoff rights.  4. I would like to discuss with you or your legal representative the removal  of the arbitration language as it is Enron's policy to have arbitration apply.  5. We would prefer to keep the Termination Currency specified in US Dollars.  6. Our tax group believes that we need the language in Part 3(a)(i), (ii).   Why do you want to delete it?

"Rhett: You may recall a few weeks ago I asked you about some language that one of  our counterparties wanted as an amendment to the term ""Indemnifiable Tax"".   Another counterparty, Deutsche Bank, has requested the following which I  think is very similar to what we were looking at before:  Notwithstanding the foregoing, ""IndemnifiableTax"" also means any Tax imposed  by reasons of a Change in Tax Law by a government or taxing authority of a  Relevant Jurisdiction of the payer, unless the payee is incorporated,  organized, managed and controlled or considered to have its seat in such  jurisdiction, or is acting for purposes of this Agreement through a branch or  office located in such jurisdiction.  In the ISDA Users' guide, they explain that the effect of this language is to  eliminate the payee's risk of bearing new taxes imposed by the payer's  jurisdiction even if the payee's activities in such jurisdiction is the basis  for such taxes. (except if the circumstances in the definition occur).    It  thus results in the payer having to gross up for such taxes.  Do you think that we can or should accept this?

Camp is about to begin!  Are you ready?  Well, we are, and we're excited  about it!!!  Here are some details that will hopefully answer any questions  you might have about your child's experience in Enron's Kidventure summer  camp.  Camp officially begins each morning between 7:30 a.m. and 8 a.m.   You must  bring your child to the Energizer private dining room by 8 a.m. (at the  latest) each morning.  You do not need visitor badges for your children.   Enron security is fully aware that you will be bringing your children in each  morning.  We will have five dedicated Enron security guards helping us with  the camp each day to ensure your child's safety while in the building.     When going from the Energizer to the bus, your children will ride a dedicated  elevator escorted by an Enron security guard.  Kidventure camp counselors  will be active with your children as soon as you drop them off in the morning  until the bus leaves at 8:15 a.m.   Your children will return to Enron at 4  p.m. each afternoon, and will continue their Enron-site activities until you  pick them up between 4 p.m. and 5 p.m.  All children MUST be picked up by 5  p.m.   A fee of $1 per minute after 5 p.m will be charged.  At the beginning of each week of camp, you will pay the remainder of your  balance to Kidventure Camps.  Your children will also receive their official  camp t-shirt on the first day of camp.  You may purchase additional t-shirts  for $10.00 each.  Each child will also make a name tag on their first day  which they will use for their camp term.    Also, if you have not sent in your liability release forms, I must have them  by tomorrow. Thanks!  Hopefully I have answered all of your questions, if not, please call me at  x37514 or e-mail me.

In the ISDA Users' guide, they explain that the effect of this language is to  eliminate the payee's risk of bearing new taxes imposed by the payer's  jurisdiction even if the payee's activities in such jurisdiction is the basis  for such taxes. (except if the circumstances in the definition occur).    It  thus results in the payer having to gross up for such taxes.  Do you think that we can or should accept this?

With respect to your Canadian securities rep, I am checking with our counsel in Canada about whether we can use your language instaed of ours.  2.   With respect to the Options rep and the ESP rep in part %, Section (b), I believe that both parties need to make such reps.  The rep in Part 5 (b)(g)(ii) is to cover the Trade Option exemption and it is different from the ESP rep below it.  3.   With respect to the language in Part 5, Section (a), this is different from the setoff language.    What this is saying is that if a party has fulfilled all of its payment obligations and an Event of Default occurs with respect to it (the ""Defaulting Party""), the other party cannot withhold any payment that it owes to the Defaulting Party.  This is different from the exercise of setoff rights.  4.   I would like to discuss with you or your legal representative the removal of the arbitration language as it is Enron's policy to have arbitration apply.  5.   We would prefer to keep the Termination Currency specified in US Dollars.  6.   Our tax group believes that we need the language in Part 3(a)(i), (ii). Why do you want to delete it?

Specifically, the current  definition of ""Indemnifiable Tax"" covers both present and future tax (as  evidenced in the definition ""Tax"") and thus, necessarily, should protect the  counterparty in the case of a ""Change in Tax Law.""  Moreover, Deutsche Bank's  amendment to ""Indemnifiable Tax"" potentially subjects us to risk that I don't  feel is in our best interest to assume because we don't have any control over  the counterparty's activities.  Bottom line - I would reject the amendment.  Please let me know if you would like me to speak to their tax counsel.

Another counterparty, Deutsche Bank, has requested the following which I  think is very similar to what we were looking at before:  Notwithstanding the foregoing, ""IndemnifiableTax"" also means any Tax imposed  by reasons of a Change in Tax Law by a government or taxing authority of a  Relevant Jurisdiction of the payer, unless the payee is incorporated,  organized, managed and controlled or considered to have its seat in such  jurisdiction, or is acting for purposes of this Agreement through a branch or  office located in such jurisdiction.  In the ISDA Users' guide, they explain that the effect of this language is to  eliminate the payee's risk of bearing new taxes imposed by the payer's  jurisdiction even if the payee's activities in such jurisdiction is the basis  for such taxes. (except if the circumstances in the definition occur).    It  thus results in the payer having to gross up for such taxes.  Do you think that we can or should accept this?

With respect to your Canadian securities rep, I am checking with our counsel in Canada about whether we can use your language instaed of ours.  2.   With respect to the Options rep and the ESP rep in part %, Section (b), I believe that both parties need to make such reps.  The rep in Part 5 (b)(g)(ii) is to cover the Trade Option exemption and it is different from the ESP rep below it.  3.   With respect to the language in Part 5, Section (a), this is different from the setoff language.    What this is saying is that if a party has fulfilled all of its payment obligations and an Event of Default occurs with respect to it (the ""Defaulting Party""), the other party cannot withhold any payment that it owes to the Defaulting Party.

"Snady: Here is what our internal counsel in Canada is recommending. Carol St. Clair EB 3892 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax) ----- Forwarded by Carol St Clair/HOU/ECT on 05/25/2000 04:39 PM -----  =09Mark Powell\CAL\ECT =09Sent by: Mark Powell =0905/25/2000 02:25 PM =09=09=20 =09=09 To: Carol St Clair/HOU/ECT@ECT =09=09 cc: Peter Keohane/CAL/ECT@ECT, Greg Johnston/CAL/ECT@ECT =09=09 Subject: Weyerhaeuser Company Limited ISDA  Hi Carol,  Peter has asked me to respond to your inquiry as to whether or not we can= =20 agree to the request of Weyerhaeuser Company Limited (""WCL"") in order to=20 replace the existing securities representations (as found near the bottom o= f=20 this e-mail) in the ISDA to:  ""It is a Qualified Party within the meaning of the Ontario Securities=20 Commission, Rule 91-505 Over-the-Counter Derivatives.""  From my perspective, there are four main reasons why this amendment would n= ot=20 be appropriate.  They are as follows:  1.  Proposed Rule 91-504 - Over-The-Counter Derivatives (""91-504"") and the= =20 corresponding companion policy have yet to be formally adopted.  At this=20 time, 91-504 is merely a proposal.  In addition to checking the Ontario=20 Securities Commission (""OSC"") website, I have contacted the lawyer who firs= t=20 brought the ""securities representation"" issue to our attention and he has= =20 confirmed that 91-504 is not yet in place and there have been no recent=20 announcements by the OSC with respect to an anticipated timeline for such= =20 adoption.  2.  Even though the WCL may trade through an office in Toronto, any trade= =20 with Enron Canada Corp. (""Enron Canada"") is likely to be considered a ""trad= e=20 within Alberta"" under Alberta securities law (due to the fact that the head= =20 office and the mind and management of Enron Canada are in Alberta).  As a= =20 result, it is important that we get representations which address Alberta= =20 securities law.  3.  In a similar vein to point number 2 above, a ""trade"" can take place in = a=20 number of jurisdictions depending upon the particular facts of the trade. = =20 Although it may seem unlikely, it is possible that trades could possibly be= =20 made in jurisdictions other than Alberta and Ontario.  With the exception o= f=20 British Columbia, I am not aware of other provinces of Canada adopting=20 similar ""blanket orders"", ""policies"" or ""rules"" with respect to this issue.=  =20 However, it is usually Ontario, Alberta and British Columbia which are at t= he=20 forefront of Canadian securities law development (with the remaining=20 jurisdictions eventually following the leaders).   I expect that, once 91-5= 04=20 is in place, we will see some movement from the remaining jurisdictions. = =20 Regardless, it would seem prudent to leave the reference to British Columbi= a=20 in place at this time.  4.  I think it is worthwhile to have the parties to the ISDA acknowledge th= e=20 fact that a transaction under the ISDA will constitute an ""OTC Derivative""= =20 (and thus, have the applicable prospectus and registration exemptions=20 potentially available to them).  I can think of no reason why it would be= =20 beneficial to either party to remove this representation.  With respect to our physical agreements, we have addressed points 1, 2 and = 3=20 above (as well as the fact that the exemptions we are relying upon are=20 provided by blanket orders and policies {as opposed to the Securities Act= =20 (Alberta), Securities Act (British Columbia) or Securities Act (Ontario)} a= nd=20 are, thus, more likely to be {and more easily} amended) with the following= =20 clause:  ""(i) each Transaction shall constitute a =01&commodity contract=018 or an = =01&OTC=20 derivative=018 or such other similar term as defined pursuant to the securi= ties=20 legislation in force in Alberta or British Columbia or pursuant to the=20 securities legislation of any other jurisdictions having application to the= =20 Transaction, and (ii) it is a =01&Qualified Party=018 within the meaning of= =20 paragraph 9.1 of Alberta Securities Commission Order Doc.#394043 and=20 paragraph 1.1 of the British Columbia Securities Commission Blanket Order= =20 BOR#91-501, in either case, as amended, restated, replaced or re-enacted fr= om=20 time to time, and pursuant to any equivalent order or other enactment made= =20 pursuant to the securities laws of Alberta, British Columbia or any other= =20 jurisdictions having application to the Transaction;""  I understand that similar language has not been adopted in the ISDA due to= =20 the ""open-ended"" nature of the above-mentioned clause.  If we want to refer= =20 to 91-504 and only to the blanket orders and policies currently in place, I= =20 would suggest that we amend the existing clause, which states:  Canadian Securities Acts.  (i) Each Transaction shall constitute an =01&OTC= =20 Derivative=018 as defined in the Securities Act (Alberta) and the Securitie= s Act=20 (British Columbia) which have application to such Transaction and (ii) it i= s=20 a =01&Qualified Party=018 within the meaning of paragraph 9.1 of Alberta Se= curities=20 Commission Order Doc#394043 and/or paragraph 1.1 of the British Columbia=20 Securities Commission Blanket Order BOR#91-501(BC), as in effect on the dat= e=20 hereof.  to:  Canadian Securities Legislation.  (i) Each Transaction shall constitute an= =20 ""OTC derivative"" within the meaning of paragraph 4 of Alberta Securities=20 Commission Order Doc#394043 (""ASC 394043""), paragraph 1.1 of British Columb= ia=20 Securities Commission Blanket Order BOR#91-501(BC) (""BCSC 91-501"") and/or= =20 paragraph 1.1 of [proposed] Ontario Securities Commission Rule 91-504 =01)= =20 Over-The-Counter Derivatives [as published by the Ontario Securities=20 Commission on January 7, 2000] (""[Proposed] OSC 91-504""), as applicable to= =20 such Transaction, (ii) it is a ""Qualified Party"" within the meaning of=20 paragraph 9.1 of ASC 394043 and/or paragraph 1.1 of BCSC 91-501, as in effe= ct=20 on the date hereof, and (iii) it is a ""qualified party"" within the meaning = of=20 paragraph 1.1 of [Proposed] OSC 91-504.  Once 91-504 is formally adopted by the OSC, the bold and square bracketed= =20 language above should be deleted and you may want to amend the ISDAs which= =20 were drafted using such language.   Similarly, if there are amendments to t= he=20 Alberta or British Columbia orders or a province (other than Ontario, Alber= ta=20 or British Columbia) which could possibly have/claim some jurisdiction with= =20 respect to a transaction under the ISDA issues a similar order or policy, y= ou=20 may want to amend the clause (and possibly, the pre-existing ISDAs).

Also note that the Indemnifiable Tax clause is a head office policy issue--DB's position is that, in cross-border transactions, the Payee may not be in a position to learn of a Tax imposed due to a Change in Tax Law in the Payor's jurisdiction which is based upon the Payee's connection with the Payor's jurisdiction, no matter how tenuous that connection.  In such a situation, the Tax would not be an IndemnifiableTax and therefore would not be grossed-up.  Further, although such a change would be a Tax Event and therefore the Payee could terminate the Agreement upon learning of the Tax, the Payee, because of its inability to learn of the tax law change might not be able to terminate in a  timely manner and would be precluded from choosing not to enter into the Transaction. The worse-case scenario would be a Transaction entered into shortly prior to the Change in Tax Law, in which case the Tax would not be grossed-up because it is not an Indemnifiable Tax, and the Payee could not terminate the Transaction because a Tax Event is triggered off of a Change in Tax Law occurring on or after the Transaction has been entered into.  We think this risk is reciprocal in cross-border transactions. The Indemnifiable Tax revision simply shifts this incremental risk from the Payee to Payor.  I can also provide alternative language whereby we maintain the same gross-up provisions as in the standard ISDA Master, but extend the ""notice"" period to sixty days prior to the date a Transaction is entered into (rather than on the date in which a Transaction is entered into), thus providing a window for learning of legislation in other jurisdictions.  On other open issues, I believe you are to check on (i) CEUM, (ii) the Event of Default, (iii)  Payment Netting, (iv) Securities Act Reps (v) Transfer language, and (vi) Arbitration.

"Mark and Jeff: Trina and i talked about the issue that you raised with me today.  Our  preference is to structure the language so that it would only trigger an  Event of Default under the Swap if the Enron merger caused an Event of  Default under the Revolver.  At the end of the day, we both felt that this is  a call that someone on the commercial side should make, such as either Ben  Glisan or Mike Jakubik.

In the cross-default language that want to add language that basically  says that even if a cross-default occurs, unless the Non-Defaulting  determines in good faith that performance by the Defaulting Party of its  obligations under the Master is ""endangered"", then no cross default is  triggered.  2. In Credit Event Upon Merger we had commented that instaed of the  ""materially weaker"" standard we wanted to specify that it meant being rated  below BBB- by S&P.  Do you feel strongly about this?  Alos, we usually have  language that says that if an event like merger occurs and the transferee  provides collateral to the other party in an amount that is satisfactory to  such party, then a Credit Event Upon Merger is not triggered.  They did not  want to add this carve-out.  Are you okay with this?  3. They want a separate Event of Default that gets triggered if a MAC (below  BBB-) occurs.  We requested that it be out in the collateral threshold  language.  4. They are saying that for ""operational"" purposes, they cannot agree to  ""netting"".  5. They want as a category of Eligible Collateral governmental securities  with a maturity of less than 1 year, valued at 98%.  6. In the CSA, if a dispute occurs with respect to either the calculation of  Exposure or the calculation of the value of any colateral in connection with  a party's request either for the transfer or return of collateral, normally  the following procedures apply:  a. the disputing party notifies the other party of the nature of the dispute  by the close of business on the day following the day that the collateral  request was made.  b. the undisputed amount is transferred to the party making the request  c. the parties attempt to resolve the dispute by the ""Resolution Time"" and if  a resolution is not reached, a recalculation of the Exposure is made and  market quotations have to be obtained.  We normally say that the Resolution Time is 3 Business Days after the dispute  notice is given.  DB wants to shorten this period to 1 Business Day after the  dispute notice is given which gives the parties less time to resolve the  dispute on their own.  What do you think?  7. If a party holds cash as collateral, we normally say that interest earned  is transferred on the first day of the month.  They want to change first to  last.  Let me know what you think.  I was hoping that some of these you could  resolve with your counterpart at DB.  Carol  ",rod.nelson@enron.com,carol.clair@enron.com,Deutsche Bank,2000-05-25 10:44:00-07:00,sent

The rep in Part 5 (b)(g)(ii) is to cover the Trade Option exemption and it is different from the ESP rep below it.  3.   With respect to the language in Part 5, Section (a), this is different from the setoff language.    What this is saying is that if a party has fulfilled all of its payment obligations and an Event of Default occurs with respect to it (the ""Defaulting Party""), the other party cannot withhold any payment that it owes to the Defaulting Party.  This is different from the exercise of setoff rights.  4.   I would like to discuss with you or your legal representative the removal of the arbitration language as it is Enron's policy to have arbitration apply.  5.   We would prefer to keep the Termination Currency specified in US Dollars.  6.   Our tax group believes that we need the language in Part 3(a)(i), (ii). Why do you want to delete it?  I look forward to hearing from you.

"Steven : I have finally had a chance to go over the outstanding credit issues with Rod  Nelson, our credit person, and here are his responses:  1. We cannot agree to the additional language in the cross-default  provision.  We need a trigger that is not subject to interpretation and  second-guessing and the language that you proposed does just that.    2. On credit event upon merger, we would prefer to define the standard for  ""materially weaker"" as below investment grade.  Is that a problem for you?  3. With respect to payment netting, we would prefer that netting apply to  Transactions that are of the same product line (i.e. all commodity swaps).   Is that a problem for you?  We thought that your operational issue had to do  more with netting across product lines.  4. In the Credit Support Annex, we would prefer that the number of days to  resolve disputes over exposure and/or value be 2 business days instead of 1.

"Sue: Sorry that I didn't get back to you over the weekend but with Arthur's  baseball schedule and all the running around that we were trying to do,  things were a bit hectic.  I'm officially brain dead today so I thought that  I would take a break and write to one of my favorite people.  Things on the baby front are progressing well.  On our last ultrasound we got  the news taht we were hoping for with respect to the placenta problem and so  I've got the green light basically to do whatever I want to do although I am  still taking it easy and swimming alot.  The baby weighed about 4 pounds a  few weeks ago and everything looked great so I was quite relieved.  Now I'm  trying to spend what little free time I have getting ready.  the people here  at work are having a baby shower a week from Friday so hopefully that will  help since other than some of Arthur's clothes I am starting from scratch.   Work is going well although I am looking forward to winding down in a few  weeks.  I'm hoping that I can work up until the very end to maximize my time  off but we will see how that goes.  I really feel great except for being  uncomfortable at night and not getting much sleep but i suppose that this is  good practice for when the baby comes.  Arthur is doing great.  We got him 2 gerbils as a substitute for a larger  pet!  They're pretty cute, small, clean and so far easy to maintain.  He is  still heavily into baseball and was just selected for the All-star team which  we were absolutely thrilled about as was he!  He called dad practically every  day that he was trying out for the team to give him an update and I'm hoping  that dad can fly down for the tournament this weekend.  Arthur would  be on  cloud nine if he came.  We'll see.  Mom and dad offerred to keep Arthur for a  week over the summer and we are looking into that.  I'm toying with the  possibility of sending him when the baby is born, but  I'll just have to see  how it works out.  I would really love for you and mom to come once the baby  is born.  Do you have any thoughts on that?  You are obvious;y welcome at any  time, but i sense from mom taht she would prefer to wait until sometime in  august.  Let me know what you think.  How is Cindy doing?  Do you know what she needs for her new addition?  Do you  want to get her a joint gift?  Let me know.  I'm happy to do either something  on my own or jointly with you.  How's Cate?  Give her my best.  What's new with you and your career situation?  I hope that you are enjoying  what you are doing.  I certainly am and  I am still undecided about what I am  going to do once that baby is born, although I would really like to take the  rest of the year off.  I've got to run to my ""baby class"" tonight.  Take care and I will try to  catch up with you sometime.  I love you!

"Rod:  There are 2 open issues on Dresdner Bank:  1. Netting - they are saying that operationally they cannot net across  product lines.  Are you okay with this?  2. Calculation Agent - they want to be the Calculation Agent.  Since we have  no CSA with them, this means that they would be doing all of the calculations  required under each transaction that we enter into with them.     Specifically, the CA does the following:  - calculates the Floating Price and the Floating Amount, Fixed Amount or Cash  Settlement Amount payable - gives notice of Settlement and Payment Dates - determines whether a Market Disruption Event has occurred  Also, my notes indicate that we agreed to increase the Guaranty  cap to  $25,000,000 from $15,000,000.  Is that okay with you?  They had initially  requested no cap.   On Reliant Energy Services, Inc., you were going to think about the following  credit issues:  1. Specified Transaction - they want to include physical energy deals.  You  were going to think about this and whether we needed a cap.  They wanted to  amend the definition of Specified Indebtedness to deal with this, but I think  you and I felt taht it should be dealt with in the definition of Specified  Transaction.  2. Cross Default threshold - is 3% of equity okay?  3. On Credit Event Upon Merger, they want to define ""materially weaker"" as  either (1) being below investment grade by either S&P or Moody's or (2) being  failed to be rated by either S&P or Moody's.  4. On setoff, they did not have the ""affiliate"" language.  5. In the CSA, they want the collateral that is posted to secure both  financial deals and physical gas and power deals entered into between ENA and  Reliant Energy Services, Inc.  6. In the collateral threshold, they have proposed a matrix of S&P and  Moody's ratings, with the threshold amount being the lower of the 2 ratings.  AA-/Aa3 and above  $20,000,000 A-/A3 to A+/A1   $15,000,000 BBB/Baa2 to BBB+/Baa1  $10,000,000  BBB-/Baa3  $5,000,000   Also, they have defined MAC  to be going below BBB- by S&P or below Baa3 by  Moody's or a failure to be rated by either S&P or Moody's.   7. In the LC provisions, they have different cure periods for each of the  types of Letter of Credit Defaults that can occur.  Here is a summary of the  events and the time periods for transferring substitute colateral:  - If issuer's credit rating is downgraded - 1 business Day after written  demand by the Secured Party - if issuer fails to comply with its obligations under the LC or disaffirms  or rejects the LC - 1 Business day after the pledgor receives notice of  dishonor - if LC fails to be in full force and effect or issuer declares bankruptcy -  3 Business Days after written demand by Secured Party  In our form, we require substitute collateral to be posted within 2 Business  Days of the occurrence of the above events, except for a downgrade where the  time period is 5 Business Days      On SG Interests, you were going to talk to them about certain credit issues.   Please let me know when you can where you stand on the above.  Thanks.  Carol  ",rod.nelson@enron.com,carol.clair@enron.com,"Dresdner Bank, Reliant, SG Interests",2000-05-31 04:53:00-07:00,sent

The User's Guides reference NY case law. You do not have to have a contact in New York. New York is not the venue, it is the governing law.

"Carol St. Clair EB 3892 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax) ----- Forwarded by Carol St Clair/HOU/ECT on 06/01/2000 06:46 PM -----   Carol St Clair  05/31/2000 11:53 AM        To: Rod Nelson/HOU/ECT@ECT    cc:     Subject: Dresdner Bank, Reliant, SG Interests  Rod:  There are 2 open issues on Dresdner Bank:  1. Netting - they are saying that operationally they cannot net across  product lines.  Are you okay with this?  2. Calculation Agent - they want to be the Calculation Agent.  Since we have  no CSA with them, this means that they would be doing all of the calculations  required under each transaction that we enter into with them.     Specifically, the CA does the following:  - calculates the Floating Price and the Floating Amount, Fixed Amount or Cash  Settlement Amount payable - gives notice of Settlement and Payment Dates - determines whether a Market Disruption Event has occurred  Also, my notes indicate that we agreed to increase the Guaranty  cap to  $25,000,000 from $15,000,000.  Is that okay with you?  They had initially  requested no cap.   On Reliant Energy Services, Inc., you were going to think about the following  credit issues:  1. Specified Transaction - they want to include physical energy deals.  You  were going to think about this and whether we needed a cap.  They wanted to  amend the definition of Specified Indebtedness to deal with this, but I think  you and I felt taht it should be dealt with in the definition of Specified  Transaction.  2. Cross Default threshold - is 3% of equity okay?  3. On Credit Event Upon Merger, they want to define ""materially weaker"" as  either (1) being below investment grade by either S&P or Moody's or (2) being  failed to be rated by either S&P or Moody's.  4. On setoff, they did not have the ""affiliate"" language.  5. In the CSA, they want the collateral that is posted to secure both  financial deals and physical gas and power deals entered into between ENA and  Reliant Energy Services, Inc.  6. In the collateral threshold, they have proposed a matrix of S&P and  Moody's ratings, with the threshold amount being the lower of the 2 ratings.  AA-/Aa3 and above  $20,000,000 A-/A3 to A+/A1   $15,000,000 BBB/Baa2 to BBB+/Baa1  $10,000,000  BBB-/Baa3  $5,000,000   Also, they have defined MAC  to be going below BBB- by S&P or below Baa3 by  Moody's or a failure to be rated by either S&P or Moody's.   7. In the LC provisions, they have different cure periods for each of the  types of Letter of Credit Defaults that can occur.  Here is a summary of the  events and the time periods for transferring substitute colateral:  - If issuer's credit rating is downgraded - 1 business Day after written  demand by the Secured Party - if issuer fails to comply with its obligations under the LC or disaffirms  or rejects the LC - 1 Business day after the pledgor receives notice of  dishonor - if LC fails to be in full force and effect or issuer declares bankruptcy -  3 Business Days after written demand by Secured Party  In our form, we require substitute collateral to be posted within 2 Business  Days of the occurrence of the above events, except for a downgrade where the  time period is 5 Business Days      On SG Interests, you were going to talk to them about certain credit issues.   Please let me know when you can where you stand on the above.  Thanks.  Carol   ",rod.nelson@enron.com,carol.clair@enron.com,"Dresdner Bank, Reliant, SG Interests",2000-06-01 11:46:00-07:00,sent

"Here are my comments to the latest set of swap docs:  1. In the swap assignment, I think that the definition of Regulated  Subsidiary can be deleted.  2. In Section 3.4 of the swap assignment, in the new language that was added  at the very end, shouldn't it say after the words ""Swap Agreement"" ""(as it  relates to the Assigned Interest)""?  In other words, if these events as to  Party B happen and it results in either an event of default or termination  event under the swap, shouldn't Party A be entitled to terminate the Swap  Agreement with respect to the portion that is not being assigned?  3. I'm assuming that the changes to Section 3.5(e) track some current cross  default language that Enron is now using.  4. In Section 3.8, the word comments should be ""consents"".

Leslie - please offer commets/suggestions from the power perspective.  Mark - final approval will need to come from you since this is a financial  product.  Also, trading wants us to consider price changes for the Product because the  prices published do change from time to time. I know that the ISDA  Definitions contemplate a 30-day true-up, but I can't find a like provision  in the GTC. So - I took a hack at some language to contemplate the issue:  ""If the price published (as set forth herein) on any day during a  Determination Period is subsequently corrected and the correction is  announced within 30 calendar days of the original publication date, the  parties agree that the corrected price shall take affect as if it were the  price published on the original publication date and the Floating Price will  be adjusted accordingly.

"Carol I'm having trouble with a few counterparties who, like Enron require an  exclusion of ""consequential"" losses. Currently under our ETA  the exclusion  for  liability consequential losses/damage only applies to Enron. There is  however, a mutual exclusion of limitation of libility in the GTCs and our  ISDAs. The major issue  I see is to ensure that we are covered for trades  that are performed by persons with a password obtained through the  counterparty. If we cover that point have we some scope to exclude the  indemnity we require  from applying to  loss of profits?         ""Creek, Peggy"" <pcreek@ue.com.au> on 06/05/2000 04:56:36 PM To: ""David Minns (E-mail)"" <david.minns@enron.com> cc:    Subject: FW: Enron Agreement   David  Further to the Electronic Trading Agreement, hopefully the following can move us closer to a resolution.  To summarise the position: * I agree that we need to replace the deemed ISDA Agreement.  Please forward a copy of the Schedule for our review. * UE agrees to acknowledge a letter from Enron stating that the Deemed ISDA Agreement is a master agreement for the purposes of the ETA. * You have stated that counterparties can control their access to Enron products, UE agrees to control the access to EnronOnLine so that at this stage, UE only trades with Enron Australia Finance for Australian power traders.  Prior to trading in other products, UE will ensure that a master agreement is in place with the relevant Enron entity. * With respect to Section 4(b) of the ETA, UE cannot agree to include consequential losses.  As we have indicated before, we do not believe that this is a risk which should be borne by UE, rather it is a risk that is better dealt with by Enron in their insurances covering business disasters etc.  Would it assist if further definition was included for consequential loss to tighten this definition?  This would be along the lines of excluding loss of profits etc.   Unfortunately this consequential loss clause appears to be holding trading up.  If Enron is unable to agree to this amendment we may need to seek an alternative method of trading.  For example, is it possible for UE to view the EnronOnline site without any access rights - this may facilitate trading albeit trading via the telephone?

We transacted with Twister last week and I had sent you a credit worksheet  for the transaction.  Twister is a broker who transacts on behalf of small  E&P companies, and in this case, the E&P agreed to post the L/C we quoted for  the transaction.  After talking to Sara, it sounds like we are going to go  ahead and send a confirmation to Twister for the deal and attach to the  confirmation an assignment of the deal from Twister to Sanguine.  It is my  understanding that both Terry and Todd will need to sign both the  confirmation and the assignment, so I think we will need to carefully  coordinate the steps through the Confirmation Desk (Sheetal Patel).  I have attached a worksheet for the transaction (Sanguine agreed to post  $500K).  Please coordinate with Sara, Sheetal and me in getting this out.  The contact information at Sanguine is: Todd Tharp Manager of Gas Contracts Sanguine, Ltd. 1861 East 71st Street South Tulsa, Ok 74136  Thanks,  John      ",carol.clair@enron.com,sara.shackleton@enron.com,Twister Omnibus/Assignment,2000-06-07 09:28:00-07:00,received

"Mark and Sara: Tana came into my office last night and seemed to be very upset about how the  other 2 legal assistants were treating her, especially Susan Bailey, and also  about the fact taht Susan Bailey was going to be part of Samantha's training  and that this was a surprise to her.  On the latter issue, I explained to her  that given that the 2 Susan's were involved in the day to day routine, it  made perfectly good sense for 1 of them to handle this part of Samantha's  training especially since Tana was now out of the day to day stuff.  I am  very concerned that Tana is going to interfere with Susan's training process  given her attitude toward the whole thing which I really feel is ridiculous.   The only possibly valid point that she might have is the fact that we didn't  tell her that this was going to work this way, but even so, again it's Tana's  way of not be able to let go and not being a team player.  I explained to her  that both she and Tana had different roles to play with respect to Samantha's  training and that they both were important and taht in my opinion, Susan was  more than qualified to handle this part of Samantha's training.  On the first point, I told Tana that the only way that this group is gong to  work better is through ""communicating"" to each other.  I firmly believe taht  there are 2 sides to this and taht all 3 of them are guilty of treating the  other 2 at time in a not so pleasant way.  Tana of course will not admit  this.  I have no answers for this issue other than the fact that I am tired  of hearing about why they can't get along.  I also told Tana taht it was my  perception that Susan Bailey has been under alot of pressure given her  increased workload and other things and taht that could explain her attitude  which even I have noticed has been a little different lately.  I'm letting the both of you know about this because I don't want any of this  to negatively impact Samantha to the extent that it can be avoided.

"Jeff: Who on the commercial side is deciding who the CA would be?  As I explained  to Nora yesterday, I think that the Enron CA should the Enron entity whose  commercial people will be in charge of this deal after it is closed.  As far  as 2(c) is concerned, would this require us to hand over confidential  information?    Is Section 3 the business deal if someone other than Enron is  the CA?  With respect to Section 7, in Section 7(a) shouldn't the term ""Event  of Default"" be tied to the Events of Default in the Swap Assignment?  With  respect to Sections 7(b) and (c), I just want to make sure that everyone is  okay with the events that could lead to the removal of Enron as the CA since  I would think that this is something that we would not want to happen.  For  example, 7(b)(ii) seems to be a trigger that could accidentally happen and  the removal of Enron as the CA seems to be a harsh penalty.  I'll defer on  this to whatever you and the commercial folks want to do.

"Stacy: I spoke with John about this.  I think in the Master Physical language we  need to do 2 things to the existing language:  1. Clarify that the exposure that is being subtracted from $50M is ENA's  Exposure.  The defined term in the ISDA is ""Exposure"".  2. Clarify that Counterparty's threshold is zero if as a result of  subtracting ENA's Exposure from $50M you get a negative number.

The idea is that there is a $50MM aggregate  threshold for the counterparty.  The ISDA will be a normal ISDA - with a  $50MM threshold.  The Master Physical will be the document that needs to be  customized to the new concept.  The Master Physical threshold language is to  simply read that there is a $50MM threshold less any exposure under the ISDA  collateral threshold.  I understood that Stacy or Jeff would adapt the Master  Physical to address any legal language differences in the contracts  - i.e.  ""Exposure"", ""Termination Amounts"" etc.   Your team needs only to provide the  ISDA to Stacy Dickson's group, and I believe they will draft the Master  Physical to their comfort level.

I will review the comments promptly (I've been on vacation so any delay was fine by me).  Regarding the cross-default, I will need to discuss it internally, and get approvals, but the collateral provision is not a core policy so we will certainly think about it.  In any event, now that we're getting close, I think it may be a good to have another converstation to discuss where we are on the remaining issues. Please let me know your availability.  Thanks and regards,  Steve  Original Message from Carol.St.Clair@enron.com @ HUB on 06/19:      Steve: I am faxing you our remaining comments to the schedules.  Looks like the only open points relate to :  1.   the additional cross-default language.  Have you had a chance to think about what I e-mailed to you?  2.   DB, pursuant to our request, is considering refining the ""materially weaker"" standard in Credit Event Upon Merger to specify a ratings test.  3.   Insertion of our Rider 7 into the ISDA Schedule regarding confirmation procedures.  4.   DB reviewing LC language and our comments to the Enron Guaranty.  I guess we still need to discuss the :defenses"" language because as I indicated to you, I'm not sure that your compromise works for us.  I look forward to hearing from you and sorry for the delay.

Are you  satisfied with their definition of Internal and External debt?  4. In Part 3(a), looks like we would only receive an annual reserve report.   Is that sufficient?  When should we get it?  Alos, whose financials do you  want to receive?  5. In Part 5(c) - Setoff, I'll just note that this only applies to amounts  due and owing between the parties and does not include ""affiliates"".    6. In Part 5(f)- Assignment,  we need to decide what conditions precedent we  want to apply to the limited partnership entity that they assign it to given  the fact that once assigned, we will have no recourse to the partners, even  the GP.  For example, should the LP have a minimum asset value at the time of  the transfer?  It is not clear to me what assets this LP would own at the  time of the transfer and I'm assuming that we would want it to meet some  minimum credit criteria prior to such transfer.  In addition, are you  satisfied with the debt and asset sale limitations?  On asset sales, I think  that they need an annual limit as it is not clear to me how the $2,000,000  limit currently works.  Alos, I think that all of these limitations in  Section (f) should either be additional Events of Default or Additional  termination Events.  Please call when ready to discuss.

"Gary: Thanks.  I will take a look at this and get back to you shortly. Carol     Gary Taylor  06/28/2000 11:16 AM        To: Carol St Clair/HOU/ECT@ECT    cc:     Subject: Bombardier memo  Carol,  I left you a message last week regarding the enclosed letter.  You asked to  see a copy...  Background: Enron and Bombardier developed a promotional campaign to help  sell snowmobiles.  Retail customers who purchased snowmobiles from various  retail vendors by October 1 were eligible for a $1,000 rebate from Bombardier  if the subsequent November-March snowfall was less than 1/2 the average of  the previous 3 years.  In October, Bombardier reported to us the number of  snowmobile sales in each city covered under our program and paid us a  predetermined premium for each unit sold.  In return, Enron was liable for  potential payouts in each of the cities covered under the program (different  payouts in each city depending on the number of Bombardier units that were  sold in each city).  The settlement date for the program was June 14 - allowing for true-ups by  the various weather services.  As of this date, we were responsible for  payouts in 6 cities.  We sent prompt payment to Bombardier.  Current Issue:  Bombardier has requested that we send a letter to to them, on  our letterhead, specifying the actual Nov-Mar snowfall amount in each city  covered under our contract with them.  They plan to forward this letter to  the stores that sold Bombardier snowmobiles under this program.  The impetus  for this letter is that some customers in cities where snowfall exceeded the  strike (no rebate payments due to customers) thought/think that they may be  entitled to a rebate.  Here is the letter:   Of course, I am waiting for your response before I send this letter out.

"Teresa: As I indicated in my voice mail message I have the following questions about  the maternity leave policy:  1. I am assuming that any vacation time that I still have left I can use up  at 100% pay.  2. My understanding is that in order to go beyond the 6 week period I would  need a letter from my doctor indicating the medical condition that exists and  justifying sick leave pay at 90%  3. If I want to take after the 6 week period an unpaid leave of absence,  whose approval do I need?  Does unpaid leave affect any of my current  benefits (i.e., options that are due to vest, medical, parking etc.)  If I am  on unpaid leave and Enron offers a stock option program at year end, am I  still eligible?  I will contact Carmen about the forms that I need to fill out.  Please let me  know if you are not the right person to answer these questions.

This is really not a risk as much  as it is a relationship issue.  2. With respect to Section 6.1(a), based on last night's conversation, I  doubt very much that they will remove the reference to counterparties.  They  really feel that this is a risk taht we should bear given our relationship to  the counterparties.  Bill is speaking with them about this issue this morning.   Carol St. Clair EB 3892 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax) carol.st.clair@enron.com     Leslie Hansen  06/28/2000 02:53 PM        To: Carol St Clair/HOU/ECT@ECT    cc:     Subject: Legal risk factors for Dash  Carol:  Gaurav asked me to summarize all relevant risks associated with the Reliable  Power Product for the Dash.  Please let me know if you think I should add or  revise anything:  1.  Section 8.3 indemnity obligation -- We are required to indemnify the  insurer from any third party claims arising out of the insurer's performance  under the policy except for a claim by a swap counterparty based upon our  refusal to pay out on the swap because the insurer denied coverage.  We hope  to have a one-year limitation on this obligation; however, this limitation  would be subject to tolling in an insolvency situation.  2.  The insurer is permitted to revoke coverage for up to one year if there  is a fraud or material misrepresentation or omission by ENA in obtaining  coverage.  (The current version of the policy also provides for revocation if  the insurer subsequently discovers fraud on the part of the swap  counterparty.  However, we intend to eliminate this from the insurance policy  if possible.)  ENA is not limited to the group of employees administering the  auction but rather includes the entire organization.  Therefore, we could pay  out on a swap to a counterparty after the insurer had approved coverage and  face a situation where the insurer changed its mind and decided to deny  coverage based on, e.g., a material omission by ENA in failing to provide  relevant information relating to coverage at the time the claim was  presented.  Absent counterparty fraud, we would not be able to go back to our  counterparty and demand reimbursement on the swap.  3.  Credit risk -- The insurer fails to pay out upon the occurrence of an  Insured Event while we are required to pay out to our swap counterparty in  the underlying swap.  4.  Loss adjustment credit risk -- If the price we use to pay a counterparty  under the swap is subsequently corrected by the floating price source, we may  be require to make a payment to our counterparty under the swap before the  insurer makes a payment to us for the loss adjustment.  However, if the price  adjustment results in a refund being owed to us by our counterparty, we may  have to pay the insurer the amount of the refund before we actually get a  refund from our counterparty.  5.  Under Section 6.1(b), the insurer can deny coverage based upon any breach  of our duties under the policy.  For instance, if we fail to comply with the  notice requirements for presenting a claim, we forego our right to coverage.   However, we will still be required to pay out on the underlying swap.

"Russell: Here are the credit related comments that Pancanadian Energy Services Inc.  made   1. They want the definition of Specified Indebtedness to exclude obligations  with Affiliates.  This is how it is defined in the Canadian Master.  2. They want a Minimum Transfer Amount for each of us of $100,000.  3. They want rounding to be reduced to $100,000 for each of us.  4. In the definition of Letter of Credit, they want the LC Bank to either be  a major US or Canadian Bank, but not a foreign bank with a US branch office.  5. In the definition of Material Adverse Change, they want to delete the  Current assets/Current Liabilities ratio trigger.

"Frank: I spoke with her attorney yesterday and believe that I addressed her concerns  with the ETA, GTC and Password Application forms.  She is going to add  language to the Password Application that makes it clear that any GTC is  considered to be ""signed"" and ""in writing"" if they are required by the  Website to click on it.  Her main concern given the fact that we now have a  Master in place with them is that they are not asked to accept the terms of a  GTC and I assured her that so long as she has a Master in place that covers  the product that she wants to trade that they will not be asked to accept a  GTC.  Anyway, putting this language in the PA seemed to make her feel  better.  Once you receive the PA from her why don't you fax it to me  and I  will let you know if it is acceptable.  Also, as I discussed with Stephanie yesterday, they wanted to do a ""test"" run  on the Website to check to make sure that they would not be asked to accept a  GTC.  I told her that the only way to do this would be to click on a product  description once they get their password.  I understand that you and Tana  will coordinate with each other when the time comes to make sure that the  ISDA Master that they executed gets coded into the Website at the proper time  so that when they do click on a product description, no GTC appears.

"Tanya: Here are the credit related comments that we received from Quaker Oats'  counsel:  1. They prefer Market Quotation instead of Loss.  This will obviously be a  discussion point given the type of commodity that we anticipate. trading with  them  2. They want a Minimum Transfer Amount just for them of $250,000.  3. They want to reduce rounding to $25,000.  4. They do not want the provisions of section 6(c) of the CSA to apply at any  time.  5. They deleted the concept that a party holding an LC could draw on it if  there was an Event of Default, meaning that we would have to wait to  terminate and have a payment  obligation owing to us before we could draw.  6. They do not want any LC to be transferable.  7. They want the Enron Guaranty to cover our obligation to return collateral  taht has been posted to us, which I guess means that if we didn't return  collateral to them then they could go after Enron for that amount.  Without  this language they would have to declare an Event of Default,  terminate and  then go after Enron for any amount that we owed them.  To the extent that we  were holding cash colateral, they could offset that amount against amounts  that they might owe us.  This is an interesting issue and one that I have not  seen before.  8. They want the Guaranty cap to be rased to $25,000,000.  Where does this ISDA stand on the priority list?  Is this something I should  try to push forward in the next week or 2 while I am hear or can it wait?  Carol",tanya.rohauer@enron.com,carol.clair@enron.com,Quaker Oats,2000-06-30 03:53:00-07:00,sent

"Robert: I am still waiting to hear back from our credit person on some of the credit  comments that you made, but here is my response to the legal and certain of  the credit comments:  1. I am okay with the first paragraph of Insert 1.  I would like to talk to  you about the second paragraph.  2. We have a strong preference and policy towards using Loss rather than  Market Quotation.  3. Inserts 2, 3, 4 and 5 are okay.  In addition. our tax people are now  advising us to require the delivery of W-9's to part 3.  4. NY is okay with governing law.  5. On arbitration, other than changing the location, I would prefer to go  with our language and really didn't see much difference in what you sent  other than the fact that it was more abbreviated. Did I miss something?  6. In Part 5, Section (e), 10 Business Days is too long.  How about 5?  7. In Part 5, Section (f), your requested change is too narrow for us.  We  can agree that any calls coming in to or going out from trading, marketing  and financial/credit personnel will be recorded.  Does that work for you?  8. Insert 7 is okay.   9. Your reduction of the rounding amount is okay.,    10. Your comments on page 4 of Annex A are okay.  11. Your comment on Annex A, page 5 is problematic for us unless we limit  posted collateral to LC's only.      12. On page 6 of Annex A, can we include both the Issuer and the pledgor?  13. Insert 8 is okay, as are the remaining comments on page 7 of Annex A  except that we need Moody's because it is used in the LC language.  14. On the LC provisions, in 1(a) can we put ""either the Issuer or X"" and in  1(b) include your language as an alternative?  15. I need to discuss with you your deletion of clause (ii) of 1(d).  We  would like the right to draw if an Event of Default has occurred and if no  payment is owed at such time, to hold it as cash collateral.  16. Raising the guaranty cap is okay as are the chnages that you made in  Section 2 of the Guaranty.  17. Inserts 10, 11 and 12 are okay.      18. In Section 6(c), I would like to keep that phrase as it refers to the  Payment Demand procedure.  19. Your chnages to Section 7 of the Guaranty are okay.  20. We can change governing law to NY but as a matter of enron policy, cannot  agree to Insert 13.  21. Insert 14 is okay although I may reword it slightly to make it clearer  that this applies in connection with a bankruptcy, insolvency or similar  proceeding.   I am waiting to hear back from my credit person with respect to the Minimum  Transfer Amount comment, the LC transfer language comment and the language of  Insert 9.  I look forward to hearing from you.  I will not be in the office  monday or tuesday.  Alos, we have recently revised our ISDA Schedule to  include the following language at the end of Part 6.

Regarding Credit, Rod Nelson has been supporting us and he is leaving all the  pending things to Paul Radous.  Last week Rod and I spoke abut this, and his  view is a little different. He believes there could be some exposure if the  same counterparty transacts both on-line and off-line; however, there are  ways to limit the transactions and very probably the likelihood of that  happening is very little.  He was going to put together an opinion froom  their side, and I suggest we have a conference call wednesday morning.... I am traveling wednesday but reachable through my assistant Barbara.  011-452-8-152-2404.   PLease call any time is convenient for you so we can  discuss this matter and also talk to your counsel.

"Steve and/or Rhett: We are trying to finalize an ISDA with the above counterparty which is  a  Bermuda company.  They made 1 tax comment to our Schedule.  Currently, they  rep to us that Each payment received or to be received by them in connect  with the Master Agreement will not be effectively connected with its conduct  of a trade or business in the US.  They want to add the following to this rep:  Each payment to be received by it in connection with the Master Agreement  will be either foreign source income under the Code or portfolio interest  within the meaning of Section 881(c) of the Code or gain derived from the  cash settlement of an option.

Looking over the  spreadsheet itself, I would be able to tell you right off which  counterparties we consider ""Credit Concerns"", where you would then prioritize  on your end.  Even though some counterparties may high high exposures, we  consider them to be ""Good Credits"" (for example Duke).  Once again, financial  exposures vary (sometimes very significantly) from one day to the next.   Therefore the totals you'll have for current exposures will not be validated  for more than a week, at the max.  Let me know how you want to go about this.

"Mr. Davis: Susan Flynn passed on to me your comments to the ISDA draft.  Please call me  when you are ready to discuss.  With respect to the Guaranty amendment that  we had requested, it is just meant to clarify in the termination section that  if the Guaranty is terminated then the Guarantor is still responsible for all  of the Counterparty's obligations with respect to any transactions that were  entered into prior to the termination date, even if such obligations are  incurred after the termination date.

I completed the master agreement column from the Lotus Notes database;  We are currently waiting on credit for the exposure information and their  assessment (e.g. 'credit concern', 'good credit', etc.);  Tagg is able to provide term information for each counterparty, but since it  is a time-intensive process, Ron Nolte is looking into adding a button in tagg that will allow this and/or create a special  customized ongoing report;  I am in the process of completing the remaining two columns (i.e. do they  sign confirms?, if they don't, reasons why?)

Schedule to Master Agreement  1.  Media General wants the cross-default to be reciprocal at $100 million for both Media General and Enron. 2.   Further, Media General thinks that this should be a cross-acceleration, not a cross-default. 3.   Page 3 of Schedule.  The ""date by which to be delivered"" for Party B should track the same with Party A: i.e., if financials are available on EDGAR then they would not be automatically provided by MG on a quarterly basis. 4.  Page 4 of Schedule.  Under (a), add ""Attn.: Chief Financial Officer"". We will send Marshall Morton's fax and telephone numbers. 5.  We will let you know who will serve as process agent.  We would like to talk about governing law in Texas and the site of arbitration in Houston. 6.  Page 6 of Schedule.  In clause(b)(g), please note that MG intends to assign this agreement and we want to make sure that does not affect this representation. 7.Page 8 of Schedule.  MG wants the right to assign this agreement to a party with a credit agreement equivalent to a certain level.  We can discuss what that level should be.  We should discuss what Enron's credit rating is in this connection.  Transaction Confirmation Document.  1. MG does not think this transaction should be characterized as a ""swaption"".  This was to be a deal for the purchase of newsprint at a fixed price, not at Enron's option. 2. We want todiscuss the expiration date. We should also discuss the other dates and terms which are blank.  On page 2, under ""Additional Provisions"", the date for satisfying conditions is clearly wrong since it refers to July 5.  Once again, all of this ties in with not being an option, but a fixed agreement. 3. We would like to have Enron render a monthly settlement statement with a net amount being paidto/receivable from MG.  No netting is presently provided for in the agreement.   ISDA Credit Support Annex  MG  would like to delete this entirely and would propose that Enron would rely on the general cross-acceleration provisions.  Media General never contemplated credit provisions more onerous than its credit agreements.            I will have the Media General business people follow up with the people at Enron, but could you please have some one get in touch with me on this.

As for Mexico setoff, I am aware.  I was under the  impression that even setoff among common entities is questionable.  My  rationale is that we will almost certainly trade with any given cp through  one Enron entity or the other, and not both.  If I am wrong, we will manage  the process internally (i.e. cut the cp's credit line in half).

I'm hoping that we will have  a child to put in it within the next week.  As for Mexico, the issue there is  that they do not recognize setoff in bankruptcy so that if deals are done  with 2 different Enron counterparties we will not be able to setoff.

"Luke: I will take a look at this either tonite or in the morning.  Since the UEI  Holdings Guaranty which we reference in paragraph 9 of the Amendment covered  both US and Canada transactions, I don't think that we can say that it has  been terminated until we sign up the Engage Canada deal.  Can you add  language to the Coastal Guaranty that takes care of this instead.  I would  prefer to say in paragraph 9 of the Engage US amendment that ""The Guaranty of  Party B dated as of May 19, 1997, heretofore delivered by UEI Holdings Inc.,  formerly known as Union Energy Inc. in favor of Party A as beneficiary, is  hereby replaced by an executed Guaranty from Coastal Corporation, a copy of  which is attached hereto as Exhibit B but only with respect to the  obligations of party B under the Master Agreement that are guaranteed  thereunder.""

Section 5. --  I am not aware of any restrictions on the ability of a  non-Mexican entity to offer financial derivatives to Mexican counterparties  where such countparties are ""vetted"" before trading commences.  It seems  that, for so long as derivatives are not offered to the public at-large, then  such an offerings can be made.  2.  Section 9(c) -- A withholding tax, as well as value-added tax, will apply  to payments made by a Mexican counterparty to a non-Mexican entity pursuant  to certain financial derivative transactions.  In addition, a non-Mexican  entity making payment to a Mexican counterparty will be required to pay  Mexican value-added tax pursuant to those certain transactions.  (Please  refer to the e-mail that I sent yesterday, which indicates that payments  pursuant to those 16 financial derivative transaction descriptions provided  to me by Jaime Williams will not be subject to any Mexican withholding or VAT  tax since they fall outside of the regime that would otherwise subject such  payments to Mexican tax.)  I have been working extensively with Mexican tax  counsel on these issues, so please consider Rich, Heather y Mueller's ""No""  response as relevant only to a tax applicable to transactions conducted  through the internet (and not with respect to the underlying transaction).

"Ana: I just got to open this up now.  Thanks for sending this and the card.  What  a week it has been.  I'm happy to report that we are all home now and except  for a lack of sleep, we are all doing well.  I ended up having Charles Eugene  by C-section and then had to spend the next 5 days in the hospital while they  tried to figure out why he was breathing erratically.  They ran all sorts of  tests on him (including a spinal tap) and the good news is that he just had  some fluid in his lungs which he didn't get rid of as part of the birthing  process.  He is okay now and a true joy!  Arthur and Bill have been a big  help.  It's nice to have someone around with me during the day.  Arthur  visited my parents right before Charles was born and had a great time.  They  spoiled him to death but I was thrilled that he made the trip there and  wished we could do that more often.  As for me, I hope to take from now until  the end of the year off from work and then decide what I want to do.  I'm  looking forward to the extended leave even though most of it will be unpaid  but it will be worth it and hopefully Charles will benefit from it.  How are things with you?  Have you seen the shore house?  It is quite a  place.  I'm hoping that mom and sue will come for a visit in late August.   Sue is Charles' godmother.  Well I need to get back to the baby.  stay in touch and thanks again for  thinking of us.  Pictures will come soon.

We are ion a feeding frenzy  every 21/2 to 3 hours and I'm hoping I can extend that at night soon.  Any  suggestions?  What type of formula do you use?

Can you  sense that I am getting restless already?  I am really going to try hard to  stay in contact with you and others there because I have discovered that  talking to you and the others on the phone or by e-mail gives me a lift.   Charles is doing well.  I am a little frustrated with the schedule that we  are on which seems to vary from day to day but hopefully things will approach  normalcy in a few weeks.  we met our new pediatrician this past week and we  both really like him.  Charles checked out fine.  He had gained over a pound  since leaving the hospital so I am happy that he appears to be getting enough  to eat.  My parents and sister are coming around Sept. 23rd for the  christening and I am looking forward to that.  Please mark your calendar for  that Sunday as I think that we will have something at the house and I very  much want you and Ric to come and meet everyone.  Alos, if people want to visit me here at the house ask them to call me.  I  would very much like to see them if they want to stop by.  I can't believe that I actually miss work but I do.  Hopefully, in a few  weeks I acn make some type of proposal to Mark but it is too soon now to do  so and I'm not sure that I could fit it in.  Alos, Mark mentioned that I  should be getting something in the mail about some stock options that I  apparently received recently.  Could you please be on the look-out for it?   I'm not sure whther all of the lawyers got some so please keep this quiet  (which I know you will).  As for Bill's mother, she turns 80 this week and everyone in the family  except Bill and I is going to Florida next weekend for a visit.  I told Bill  that he could go but he decided not to.  We bought her some really pretty  (and expensive) earrings which I hope she will like.  She has not yet given  us a date for her visit and I can't figure out if we are still in the  doghouse with her or not because we didn't let her come this past week.

I'm assuming $10M  if the Guaranty only covers Engage US.  3. In Section 6, there should be no restriction on our ability to assign our  rights under the Guaranty in connection with any assignment of the swap that  is done in accordance with the Master Agreement.  The restriction should only  be on the Guarantor's right to assign.  4. Please add a section that prohibits amendments without our consent.  5.

He is looking into what issues need to be reviewed/discussed.   According to Carol there are no open issues.  If that is the case can we send  executed copy's of the ISDA to him for signature.

"Suzanne: That's a trick question which I will not answer!!  I have been getting as  much sleep as Charles will let me for short periods of time.  It's really not  too bad and sometimes I take a nap in the late afternoon with him.  I'm still  breast feeding but my doctor said it would be okay to supplement with formula  so at midday he gets a bottle which allows Bill and I to get out of the house  for lunch most of the time.  I'm still running/walking in the mornings and  with Bill at night and i really enjoy the break.  I just can't stay in the  house all day and night.  Arthur started school yesterday and we've enrolled  him in a fall tennis camp twice a week.  He has really shown an interest in  tennis and i hope it continues.  I hope to get back on the court in a few  weeks but that seems to be the one activity that bothers me the most probably  because of the stopping and staring and the quick side to side movements.  Bill has been very helpful relieving me for short periods of time although  there is not much he can do in terms of feeding Charles since that's up to  me, but I'm glad that he is here with me although there are times when we are  sick of each other.  Once I start bottle feeding he will be able to do more.  Hope all is well with you.   I hope to maybe be up for a visit next week if I  can find a time that works.  I'll let you know.

Thanks for your note and glad to hear you're feeling better.  Yes we are all  very sad about Jim's baby.  Many years ago my sister had a child who was born  two or three months early and lived for several days - long enough to be held  and loved - but his lungs were apparently just not developed enough and they  couldn't save him.   I know how painful that was for them.   And I have to  admit that experience made me very anxious when things didn't go perfectly  for you guys that first few days.   I received papers from Julia regarding your options a week or so ago which I  didn't send along because the next day Julia said HR had made a mistake in  everybody's package and HR was sending replacement documents - I haven't  received the replacements yet but will ask.  Stephanie has started and seems to be fitting in as far as I can tell at this  stage.  We're all super busy but more or less keeping up with the critical  stuff.

I hope that you  will join me in achieving Ken  Lay's goal of 100% participation by Wednesday, August 23.    ENRON has created a home page making it very convenient to make a pledge.   Please take a FEW minutes and visit http://unitedway.enron.com to make your  confidential pledge.    If you experience any problems entering the system please contact me at  X57373 immediately.  We are in the process of ironing out a 'glitche' or  two.    Remember, No gift is too small.  Thank your for your consideration.

"Julia: I thought that it would be easier to e-mail you since we keep missing each  other on the phone.  All of the St. Clair's are doing well.  Charles keeps  growing.  At his last visit last week he was 11 1/2 pounds and 22 inches.   Needless to say he likes to eat.  He is gradually starting to sleep more at  night but is still pretty unpredictable and I've just gotten used to not  getting alot of sleep.  Having Bill home with me is a big help and it makes  it alot easier for me since we can trade off.  Physically, I am feeling almost 100%.  I started running a few weeks ago just  to keep my sanity and have started playing tennis again although it is going  to take a long time for me to get back into playing shape.  Arthur is very  much into tennis and I am enjoying getting to watch him play.  He played in  his first tournament over the weekend and did very well.  Bill and I are  hoping that he keeps it up.  He has been great with the baby as I expected.   He is a calming influence on him and really interacts well with him.  I feel  very, very fortunate.  How are you doing and how are the boys?  I miss work and the interaction with  everyone, but at the same time I am enjoying my time at home.  I think that  you know how I must feel and I'm glad that I still have some time to think  about it.  I can't imagine having to go back after 6 weeks as I am just  beginning to feel good physically.  Carol St. Clair  Arthur is back in school and is a big help at home.  I'm enjoying being home  with him when he gets home from school and its nice to be able to visit him  while he is in school.  I hope that you are doing well and not killing yourself up there.  How are  your parents doing?  Please give them my best.  I keep promising to come up  for a visit and I will soon.  Tomorrow (Thursday) may be a possibility.  Hope  to see you soon.  Take care.  Carol",julia.murray@enron.com,carol.clair@enron.com,How Are You?,2000-08-30 01:16:00-07:00,sent
Hi Carol!  Thrilled to hear all is going well.  I would love to play tennis anytime  (hopefully sooner rather than later so I can take advantage of  that  lingering fatigue that takes months? years? to abate).  We can play at the  Met either around lunchtime or sometime after 4:00.  Weekends would also  work.  Can you play next Tuesday or Wednesday?  Call or write.  See you soon Elizabeth 713 853 6349,carol.clair@enron.com,elizabeth.sager@enron.com,Re: Tennis Anyone?,2000-08-30 01:59:00-07:00,received
"Mark, Julia and Kristina: We are planning to have Charles baptized on Sunday, September 24th and are  having a luncheon at our house afterwards from 12-2.  My parents and younger  sister will be in town and I would love for you to be able to meet them as  well as see Charles of course.  I will be mailing invitations shortly, but  thought that I would give you some advanced notice.  Don't worry if you can't  make it as there will be plenty more opportunities to see Charles and of  course you are always welcome to come out to the house for a visit.

"Kristina: I'm thrilled that you are coming.  I'll e-mail you directions soon and I  can't wait to see you.  I'm doing well.  Believe it or not, I'm playing alot  of tennis (word spread at our club that i was home during the day) and with  Bill home we pretty much just ""tag- team"" it with Charles  and the club  provides babysitting services which we sometimes use.  This has been a great  outlet for me and a way to get back into shape which will take some time.   Arthur is still very much into tennis and starting to play competitively.   I'm just keeping my fingers crossed that he keeps it up.  As for Charles,  he's now 13 lbs., 6 ounces and almost 23 inches long.  I have stopped  breast-feeding and started bottle feeding him which seems to work better  particularly at night.  He now wakes up usually just once at night and I'm  starting to get more sleep which is nice.  Don't worry about waking anybody up when you call here.  Bill is usually here  and Charles doesn't sleep much during the day anyway.  I've thought about  coming up to the office a few times but  with Bill's schedule, Arthur's  tennis and my tennis, I just haven't found a day that works.  Hopefully I'll  get up there soon although I must sound like a broken record by now.

I keep trying to pick a good day  to come up to the office, but so far have not found a day that works for both  Bill and I but hopefully I'll see everyone soon.

Everyone here is doing great.  Believe it or not,  I'm playing alot of tennis and enjoying it very much.  There are leagues at  our club almost every morning and with Bill at home, it has given me the  opportunity to get out of the house and play with the ""girls"" which is alot  of fun for me and is helping me get back into shape.  I hate to admit it, but  between playing tennis and doing some volunteer stuff at Arthur's school, I  could actually get used to this sat at home stuff although I still really  miss my work and it's going to be a tough decision when I have to make it in  a few months.  Charles is doing great.  Wait until you see how much he has grown.  I can't  wait for my parents visit.  I just wish that they would stay longer!  Alos,  don't be bashful about stopping by here when you are in the neighborhood.   The only bad times are after 7 at night.  Charles gets pretty cranky around  that time and we are working on trying to get him to sleep more during the  day.  Part of that is our fault for being out of the house so often during  the day but I need to get out, otherwise I would go crazy for sure.

Where do you think Scott Sefton will  end up?  She seemed to thing that he might take the compensation package that  apparently was offerred to him.  It was good to talk to her and get back in  touch with work.  I'm still playing alot of tennis and really enjoying it.   Charles is now old enough for the daycare that our tennis club provides so  Bill and I go out there quite a bit in the morning to hit which is nice.  i  still don't know what my long range plans are and will probably start  discussing with Bill what to do in the next few weeks.

Charles will be almost  4 months old and I can't believe how much he has grown.  We finally have  established a day and night routine for him and I'm happy to report that I'm  starting to get more sleep which is nice.  I'm still running and playing alot  of tennis which has helped me keep my sanity.  I have really enjoyed my stay  at home.  It's nice to be able to watch  your kids grow up and both Arthur  and Charles I think have really benefitted from us both being home with  them.  I feel very fortunate.  I would really like to have lunch with you in the next few weeks so that I  can catch up on what has been going on and begin discussing with you my  thoughts about returning to work.

These change= s=20 are intended to accomplish four key objectives:  First, we need to realign all our wholesale businesses around the successfu= l=20 business model developed over the last decade in North America and Europe. = =20 This model relies on extensive physical and transactional networks built=20 around a relatively small strategic asset position.  Second, we need to significantly streamline corporate reporting=20 relationships.  Particularly with Joe Sutton=01,s departure, the ability to= =20 directly manage the day-to-day activities of 15 independent business units= =20 has become increasingly difficult.  Third, we need to accomplish these changes without, in any way, compromisin= g=20 the ongoing profitability of all our businesses and without delaying or=20 hindering our effort to monetize a significant portion of our lower-yieldin= g=20 asset positions.  And fourth, as always, we need to take advantage of the reorganization to= =20 redeploy our talent into our highest value opportunities.  ENRON WHOLESALE SERVICES  Today, we are forming Enron Wholesale Services (EWS) which will consolidate= =20 our global wholesale businesses.  The closer alignment of our wholesale=20 businesses will accomplish the following: (1) enhanced communication and=20 coordination across business units, (2) more rapid deployment of people to= =20 higher valued opportunities, (3) more effective prioritization of=20 opportunities across the wholesale business, and (4) more rapid extension o= f=20 Enron=01,s wholesale business model and capabilities into new industries an= d=20 markets.  Enron Wholesale Services will include our current North American, European= =20 (including Japan and Australia), Global Markets, and Industrial Markets=20 operations, and will be expanded to include Enron=01,s Net Works business u= nit=20 as well as a new unit =01) Enron Global Assets.  In addition, Enron=01,s me= rchant=20 businesses outside of North America and Europe will be integrated into this= =20 new structure as described below.  Mark Frevert, currently Chairman of each of our wholesale units, will assum= e=20 the role of Chairman and CEO of Enron Wholesale Services.  Greg Whalley,=20 currently Chairman and CEO of Enron Net Works, will join Mark in the Office= =20 of the Chairman as President and Chief Operating Officer.  Providing further impetus for these organizational changes, several of our= =20 international business unit leaders have elected to move into new leadershi= p=20 positions:  Rebecca McDonald, currently CEO of Enron APACHI, will join EWS as President= =20 and CEO of Enron Global Assets. Enron Global Assets will have responsibilit= y=20 for managing all of Enron=01,s existing energy asset portfolio outside of N= orth=20 America and Europe.  Joining Rebecca in the Office of the Chairman as COO= =20 will be Jim Hughes, currently COO of Enron APACHI.  Rebecca and Jim will=20 report to the EWS Office of the Chairman.  Sanjay Bhatnagar, currently CEO of Enron India, has joined EBS as CEO for t= he=20 Middle East and Asia region.  Sanjay will be responsible for building our= =20 broadband business in this region and the current EBS team in this region= =20 will report to Sanjay.  In this role, Sanjay will report to the EBS office = of=20 the Chairman.  In addition, Sanjay will continue to remain responsible for= =20 Enron=01,s wholesale energy business in India and will transition this busi= ness=20 into Enron Global Assets in the near future. =20 Diomedes Christodoulou, currently Co-CEO of Enron South America, has joined= =20 EBS as Chief Commercial Officer.  Diomedes will be located in London and wi= ll=20 focus his origination activities on global opportunities, with near term=20 attention to the wholesale and enterprise sectors.  Diomedes will report to= =20 the EBS Office of the Chairman.  Jim Bannantine, currently Co-CEO of Enron South America, will be joining EE= S=20 to lead EES=01, commercial efforts outside North America and Europe.  In or= der=20 to ensure a smooth transition for our South American businesses and to=20 facilitate our asset sales activities, Jim will remain in South America for= =20 at least the next several months and continue to serve as CEO of Enron Sout= h=20 America.  Throughout the transition, Jim will report to Cliff Baxter and to= =20 the Office of the Chairman of Enron Wholesale Services.  Following the=20 transition, Jim will join EES.  In addition to these changes in our international asset operations=20 activities, we are making the following changes in our merchant wholesale= =20 businesses and the commercial support functions:  Enron Net Works Louise Kitchen will assume Greg=01,s previous responsibilities as President=  and=20 CEO of Enron Net Works, reporting into Mark and Greg. =20  Enron Americas Concurrent with the transfer to Enron Global Assets of responsibility for= =20 operating Enron=01,s South and Central America asset base, all trading,=20 marketing, and new asset development activities in these regions will repor= t=20 into a new entity, Enron Americas.  Enron Americas will have responsibility= =20 for all wholesale merchant businesses across North, Central and South=20 America.  Dave Delainey, President and CEO, and John Lavorato, Chief=20 Operating Officer will comprise the Office of the Chairman for Enron=20 Americas.  Enron Europe The Enron Europe organization, which includes Enron=01,s businesses in Aust= ralia=20 and Japan, and Enron Metals, remains unchanged under the leadership of John= =20 Sherriff, President and CEO, and Michael Brown, Chief Operating Officer.  Enron Global Markets Enron Global Markets, under the leadership of Mike McConnell, President and= =20 CEO, and Jeff Shankman, Chief Operating Officer, will continue to have=20 responsibility for Enron=01,s Middle East and LNG operations.  With the=20 exception of Ecoelectrica in Puerto Rico, all operating power plants and=20 associated personnel in the Caribbean and Central America will transfer to= =20 Enron Global Assets.  Enron Global Markets will also continue to manage the= =20 commodity businesses in crude and products, coal, weather, insurance,=20 equities, interest rates, foreign exchange, and agricultural products.  Enron Industrial Markets Enron Industrial Markets=01, organization, under the leadership of Jeff McM= ahon,=20 President & CEO, and Ray Bowen, Chief Operating Officer, remains unchanged.  Commercial Support for EWS The commercial support functions for EWS will remain with, and be managed b= y,=20 the individual business units.  We are creating no incremental overhead in= =20 the creation of EWS, and in fact hope to reduce our operating costs by more= =20 efficient utilization and sharing of resources across EWS.  To this end we have asked several people to take on an expanded role across= =20 EWS in addition to their ongoing roles within their business units.  These= =20 newly defined roles are as follows:  Mid and Back Office Operations =01) Sally Beck will lead Mid and Back Offic= e=20 Operations across EWS.  These services will become part of Enron Net Works,= =20 with Sally reporting to Louise Kitchen and Rick Causey, Executive Vice=20 President and Chief Accounting Officer.  This alignment creates a coordinat= ed=20 services organization with IT and e-commerce platforms to support the=20 wholesale businesses and to maximize opportunities to commercialize these= =20 services.  Mid and Back Office services for all commercial activities will= =20 continue to be organized with dedicated operations controllers responsible= =20 for specific commodities and/or geographic locations. Legal =01) Mark Haedicke will serve in the role of General Counsel for EWS. Regulatory and Government Affairs =01) This function will remain organized = on a=20 regional basis.  Rick Shapiro will support all EWS businesses operating in= =20 the Americas, and Mark Schroeder, who is based in London, will support all= =20 European and Eastern Hemisphere operations.  Rick and Mark will also contin= ue=20 to support all other Enron businesses operating in their respective regions= =20 and will continue to report to Steve Kean, Executive Vice President and Chi= ef=20 of Staff. Public Relations =01) This function is also organized primarily on a region= al=20 basis.  Eric Thode will have responsibility for North American activity,=20 Enron Net Works, and Enron Industrial Markets.  Jackie Gentle will continue= =20 in her role for Enron Europe (including Japan and Australia) and John Amble= r=20 will have responsibility for activity outside North America and Europe as= =20 well as providing support for Enron Global Markets and Enron Global Assets.=  =20 These individuals will also continue to have a split reporting relationship= =20 to Mark Palmer, Vice President of Communications. Business Analysis and Reporting =01) Wes Colwell will expand his role to co= ver=20 EWS reporting in addition to his current role in North America.

"Carol,  I am about to be on nanny #9 since July, 1999 - I haven't had great luck and  always have a live-in.  I am presently going through Au Pair in America and I  would be happy to have them send you info - but they do live in and there is  a pretty substantial agency fee.  My assistant, Erica Braden, also found an  interesting website www.nanniesplus.com which seems to have a whole range of  different types of nannies who work in different circumstances (i.e. live-in,  live-out, housework, no housework, etc.) - this also involves an agency and a  smaller (but not insignificant) fee than au pair in America.  From time to  time Ali's school will have a posting for a nanny - I'll forward it to you if  I see such a listing.  Good luck - may you fare better than I have!

"Sheila: Thanks for offering to participate.  I will probably go ahead and get her the  gift certificate from Urban Retreat.  I just need to hear back from Mary  before I get it.  Looks like everyone else has already gotten her a gift.   Things are going great here.  Charles is now a little over 4 months old and  almost 16 lbs. and is doing great.  I'm sorry that I haven't been up there  for a visit but hopefully someday soon before he goes off to college I will  come up for a visit!  Hope that you are doing well.  Look forward to seeing  you soon.  Also, we are beginning the ""nanny"" search.  If you know of someone  or agency that you would trust please let me know.

As you may know, I have been out since July 12th on maternity  leave/extended unpaid leave of absence.  My plan is to return to work on  January 8th.  Here are my questions:  1. I am considering coming back to work on a part time basis.  From a  benefits standpoint, is there any difference between a RRH employee (30-39  hours) versus a RPT employee (20-29 hours)?  In others words, are there any  benefits that I would lose if I worked part-time?  The difference is in the amount of Flexdollars you would receive, as stated  below:   Medical Coverage Semi Monthly      Flexdollars RRH Employee Only  123.22  Employee/Spouse 146.97  Employee/Child 137.00  Employee/family 165.25  RPT Employee Only  82.15  Employee/Spouse 97.98  Employee/Child 91.34  Employee/family 110.17   2. Given the fact that I am not returning until January 8th, am I still  eligible for any stock option grant program that the company may institute at  year-end?    That is currently under discussion in developing the new Stock Option  program.  However, they are leaning towards allowing individuals in your  situation to be apart of the program. Is there any additional paper-work that I need to submit to keep me  eligible?   No. Both my immediate boss, Mark Taylor and our general counsel, Mark Haedicke  are aware of the fact that I am not returning back to work until January,  2001.  3. Our bank account has been recently changed.  I pulled down the ""Direct  Deposit Authorization"" form and I am assuming that all I need to do is to  fill it out and send it back to you.  Is that correct?  Yes, please send to  EB3698 What is your office location?  4. As I get closer to my return date, is there any paperwork that needs to be  submitted to notify payroll of my return since I am currently not being paid?  No.  Your time will be change coding from LOA without pay to Active time.  I look forward to hearing from you either by phone or e-mail.  My home phone  number is 281-890-7122.

"Mark: I wanted to let you know that I did meet with Mark Haedicke last week to  discuss my work situation, and in particular, coming back on a part-time  basis sometime in January.  I think that he was okay with what I proposed,  which is to work approx. 30 hours a week on a 4 day week.  I would like your  input on which day you would prefer I take off, as my initial thought was  Friday, but I'm open to suggestion on that.  I think that the next step is  for the 3 of us to meet to discuss what my role in the group will be, and in  particular, what work areas I will be responsible for.  I will try to set  something up in the next few weeks.  I alos had lunch with Mary and Sara and  was encouraged with what I heard from them.  We talked about the possibility  of having a group offsite meeting in early January to talk about group goals,  work assignments/areas of responsibility for each attorney etc.  What do you  think about that idea?  As I mentioned to you at our lunch, I need some  direction as to what my responsibilities will be when I return to the group  and given the fact that we have acquired more people and more work areas, it  seems like some planning and discussion as to who is responsible for what  work is in order.  Let me know what you think.  Take care.  Carol ",mark.taylor@enron.com,carol.clair@enron.com,Meeting with Mark Haedicke,2000-12-04 00:43:00-08:00,sent

"Carol,  I have incorporated your changes into the attached confirm for Worthington.  In addition, I have adjusted the language in the floating price determination  section to more clearly describe what will occur. After reading Annex A and  discussing the entire document with the traders I have the following two  questions:  1. The traders I spoke with wondered if section 7 ""Market Disruption,"" in  Annex A needed to be modified since in steel we do not determine our price  every day. Instead in steel we calculate the price once a month and only on  the day when Purchasing Magazine is published. Therefore the term ""trading  day,"" is a little ambiguous. 2. Should we adjust paragraph two of section 2, ""Payments"" in Annex A. That  paragraph currently stipulates how certain numbers should be rounded in  floating price calculations. Since we use ""tons"" and ""net tons"" instead of  Mmbtus, gallons, barrels, and megawatt hours, we may need to define how  accurate we want everyone to be.  After addressing items 1 and 2 above, could you review this entire document  from two perspectives:  3. As the Worthington steel financial swap, and 4. As the template for all steel financial swaps for Tiffany to use.  If/when you approve it, please forward it to Tiffany, for use as a generic  template, and to me, for use in this transaction.

"Rob: In case we don't get a chance to talk, just some thoughts on chnages that mat  need to be made to the ISDA Schedule:  1. Part 1 (b) - this is where we will specify the Threshold Amount for cross  default to other debt (Section 5(a)(vi) purposes.  Please note that the  definition of Specified Indebtedness in the ISDA is very narrow.  Let Mark  Taylor know if that needs to be amended.  Alos, let Mark know if the cross  default language itself needs to be amended to match the Supply Agreement.  2. Part 1 (h) - this section contemplates adding Additional Termination  Events.  I had thought that here we would add a cross default to the  Transaction Documents.  Mark will need input from you on what those are.   Additionally, it would be here that we would add some of the other trigger  events that are currently in the Supply Agreement.  Again, Mark will need  your input on what those are.  3. Please look at the language in sections 5(a)(vii)(bankruptcy) and  5(b)(iv)(credit event upon merger) of the ISDA form and advise Mark as to  whether any changes need to be made to conform with what is in the Supply  Agreement.  I'm assuming that the other parts of the schedule will be agreed to by them.   Please note that in Part 1(e) we have chosen the ""Loss"" method as a means for  calculating the termination payment.  In Part 3, these are the docs that we  usually get but if the Supply Agreement requires something different,  particularly with respect to financial info, we can modify accordingly.    In  part 4, we have chosen arbitration and Texas as governing law.  Part 5 is  mostly boilerplate, but note the ""setoff"" language and the ""transfer""  language, which they may comment on.  part 6 is boilerplate.   Mark's number is 853-7459.

Chuck Grassley introduced legislation last night to overhaul the nation's bankruptcy system.  The bill he introduced - S.220 - is identical to the final conference report approved last year by the Senate and House of Representatives but pocket-vetoed by President Clinton.  Grassley said that he looks forward to Senate action on the measure which had veto-proof support last year. Senators voted 70-28 for the final package, and the House gave the conference report unanimous approval in December. Rep. George Gekas is expected to reintroduce the legislation in the House.  The Senate Majority Leader has indicated that the bankruptcy reform bill could be ready for consideration by the Senate as early as next week. Grassley said the proposal which he sponsored last year with Sen. Robert Torricelli of New Jersey ""is unfinished business that has strong bipartisan support in Congress and at the grassroots.""  The reform measure is aimed at reducing the number of bankruptcies filed each year by fixing weaknesses in the code and designing a more balanced, fair approach for debtors and creditors. The number of bankruptcies have soared during the last decade despite a historically strong economy. And, according to a study released late last year, experts are predicting a 15 percent increase in bankruptcies in 2001.  The legislation advanced by Grassley and Gekas also includes permanent status and an expansion of Chapter 12, which is tailored to help farmers reorganize debt and stay in the business of farming. It also includes a patients' bill of rights for residents of nursing homes and hospitals that declare bankruptcy. Another key provision helps to strengthen the Medicare Trust Fund by prohibiting the discharge of debts arising from inflated bills and fraudulent claims.  The legislation reintroduced today reflects the bipartisan, bicameral agreement reached late last year on the most comprehensive reform of bankruptcy law since 1978.  Grassley said ""reforming the system will be good for consumers and families. It would bring more fairness for those who work hard to pay their bills. Every bankruptcy filed puts upward pressure on interest rates, so decreasing the number is good for people trying to buy a new house or pay for a car. Reforming the bankruptcy system will help usher in a new era of greater personal responsibility."" The Iowa senator began his effort to reform the bankruptcy system in 1997, when he held a hearing on the relationship between credit card debt and consumer bankruptcy.  The bill that resulted addresses the problems caused by irresponsible consumerism, an aggressive credit industry, lax bankruptcy laws and lawyer-run bankruptcy mills. It sets up a flexible formula for bankruptcy judges to channel those with repayment capacity to Chapter 13. Currently, the overwhelming majority of debtors file under Chapter 7, which effectively wipes away their debts. Only about one-third of debtors opt to file under Chapter 13, which requires some repayment plan to reimburse creditors.  The measure also seeks to improve the bankruptcy system for consumers by promoting credit counseling services and educational courses for debtors prior to filing a bankruptcy petition. The plan strengthens enforcement and penalties against coercive tactics by creditors. It penalizes creditors who seek a double-payment and establishes tough penalties for creditors who use threats to coerce debtors into voluntarily agreeing to pay a debt which could be wiped away in bankruptcy.  The legislation will minimize court dockets and keep costs down. It promotes the alternative dispute resolution process by saying that if someone in financial trouble tries in good faith to work out a reasonable repayment plan, but a creditor rejects this, then the ability of the creditor to collect in bankruptcy will be sharply curtailed.  The bill also would make Chapter 12 for farmers a permanent part of the bankruptcy code. The package strengthens this tool for farmers by making an increased number of farmers eligible for Chapter 12 protections and making the federal government last on the list of creditors when a farmer sells farm assets during reorganization. Changing the treatment of capital gains taxes under Chapter 12 would give farmers greater flexibility in reorganizing their financial affairs.  Finally, the reform proposal includes:  - a provision to protect quality of care for patients - especially nursing home residents - when a health care provider is in bankruptcy. Current law does not guarantee the well-being of patients in a bankruptcy case. Two years ago, residents of a California nursing home were literally evicted onto the street by a bankruptcy trustee.  - a provision setting new requirements for credit card companies and protect consumers. These provisions reflect some of the most significant pro-consumer legislation considered by the Senate in a decade. Under the measure, creditors are required to display prominently a minimum payment warning on every credit card statement. This feature would include a toll-free number for credit card holders to learn how many months it would take to repay a certain balance with minimum monthly payments. It also requires credit card solicitations to disclose when a low introductory rate ends and what the subsequent rate will be. And, it requires credit card solicitations via the Internet to comply with the Truth in Lending Act.  - unprecedented new protections for child support claimants. The reform bill allows claimants to access otherwise off-limits property and has the support of key child support advocates.  - limits on the ability of individuals to protect assets by purchasing an expensive home. Right now, there are no limits on the value of a homestead that is off-limits to creditors. Although the General Accounting Office found only scant evidence of systemic abuse of the homestead exemption, the bankruptcy reform bill includes changes long-advocated by Sen. Herb Kohl of Wisconsin and Sen. Jeff Sessions of Alabama to put a $100,000 cap on home equity acquired within two years prior to declaring bankruptcy. The Kohl-Sessions proposal requires that an individual establish residency for two years prior to bankruptcy in order to claim the homestead exemption of a particular state. The bill also allows creditors to seize any home equity acquired with the intent to delay or hinder collection efforts within seven years prior to declaring bankruptcy. And it says the home equity built up applies to the $100,000 cap even if an individual relocates from one state to another.  Since 1990, the rate of personal bankruptcy filings has increased almost 100 percent. Since 1980, the number of Americans declaring bankruptcy has exploded from 331,264 to just under 1.4 million last year. Filings began to increase dramatically after 1985, despite the strong economy.  -30-   Home| Constituent Services| Grassley News | Legislative Information| Kids' Stuff| Biography / In Action",carol.clair@enron.com,mark.taylor@enron.com,Grassley Bankruptcy Legislation Press Release,2001-01-31 12:50:00-08:00,received

I appreciate the  attention you are paying and I am sorry that I am unable to answer many of  your questions.    I have had an interesting idea today that could make your life simpler and  would certainly help me move a little mountain (consisting of ISDA  agreements) on my desk which plagues me frequently.  We have 7 ISDA agreements that we are ""working on"" at the moment, counter  party and status below.  1. IBJ - Drafts sent August, nearly done.  Credit/CSA issues.  2. Mitsui Fire & Marine - Drafts sent to them in August, no feedback  whatsoever, we have not chased. 3. Sanwa - Drafts sent August, no feedback whatsoever, we have not chased.  4. BTM - We have their first draft which you are helping me do comments on.   Bank is pushing this forward.  5. Toa Reinsurance - They are waiting for our first draft. They push from  time to time.  6. Fuji Bank - They are waiting for our first draft. They have never pushed. 7. Yasuda Fire & Marine Insurance - They are waiting for our first draft.  They have never pushed.   On the Enron Japan side, Joe Hirl has confirmed today that he needs me to  focus on power contracts for now since the above lack of action is not  slowing business (because our dealers are not focusing on doing derivative  deals).  On the other hand there is heaps of power contract work that I am  not getting to as well and this is slowing down business (it is tough in a  one person legal department).  Having said that though, we need to do drafts of 5, 6 and 7 given that We  told the customers in August (I think) that they were on their way.  Chasing  up on 2 and 3 is important but not as important.  I think I can handle 1 but  you know I need to do a lot of work on 4 including going back to B&M to find  out why many of the provisions are included.  What I am wondering is whether you could work on 4, 5, 6 and 7 out of Houston  directly with Jeremy at B&M and the customers directly, copying me in on  everything of course.  When we have been able to identify the ""issues"", and  we are Erland to sit down and negotiate  with customers, I would of course  get involved again under your direction.  I think this would make it easier, help me to learn from you about ISDA  Agreements and Enron's way, help you to learn market practice here, keep our  outside legal fees down and give customers better service that I have been  able to.  What do you think?    I have copied Alan and Mark in case they have any comments.  (Joe Hirl knows  I am asking you about this and is willing for Houston to charge your time to  Enron Japan.)

Chris Long (Enron) was there with Ellen Levinson of our Washington office. The ""big"" issue discussed was whether to push hard for amendments on cross-affiliate netting.  The consensus was that while everyone in the room (and all of Wall Street was there,as well as ISDA and commodities groups) wants the amendments, they are considered controversial by the President's Working Group and could derail progress on the version of bankruptcy reform currently before Congress which everyone also agrees is very good legislation for financial markets participants.  On the basis that getting the current bill enacted quickly is of paramount importance, the Association determined to ""back pocket"" the cross-affiliate netting issue, meaning that if the current legislation moves quickly, the Association will not raise the issue but if the legislation gets bogged down in committee and other nontechnical changes are being proposed, the Association will use that opportunity to add cross-affiliate netting provisions.

Note that unlike earlier versions, which amended the Senate Bill S.220, this package amends the House Bill H.R.333.  It is also a line-by-line mark-up instead of a hand written mark-up of the actual bill.  House Financial Services Committee staff is working with the Legislative Counsel of the House of Representatives to put our amendments in draft form. We will forward the final amendment as soon as it is received.  It appears that our amendments will be offered by Chairman Oxley and will not be included in the Sensenbrenner amendment.  The House Rules Committee is meeting on the legislation at 2:00 on Wednesday. A floor vote is expected on Thursday.  I can be reached on 917-543-9622 should you have any questions.  Many thanks.

We have included both the annotated and unannotated versions, as well as a blackline showing changes from yesterday's version. The only changes are (1) an addition in the definition of master netting agreement on page 334 relating to guarantees and reimbursement obligations in respect of such agreements, which we understand is acceptable to Mike Krimminger at the FDIC, (2) the deletion of an incorrect section numbering change on page 351, and (3) the insertion of a revised ""placeholder"" provision on page 348 relating to rulemaking by the SEC and CFTC to address the treatment of security futures products and joint securities/futures accounts in the insolvency context.  As we have mentioned, the placeholder is intended to be replaced by substantive language following further discussions between the SEC and CFTC (and would presumably be removed if the agencies do not agree on substantive language).   Although we have discussed the substance of the new placeholder provision with the SEC and CFTC, the SEC has not yet signed off on the specific language.  We understand that although the CFTC does not ""endorse"" the placeholder language, it does not object to its inclusion as a placeholder for this purpose.

Frankly, I do not know what it means  to assign a swap from 1 of these vehicles to another vehicle. I think that in  general the schedules to the ISDAs that each of the 2 sets of parties  executed are the same, but what happens in the case of differences? My rather  simplistic approach would be to terminate the existing swaps in Raptor 2 and  execute new swaps at the same time and on the same terms in Raptor 4.   Unless anyone objects, I propose that we proceed along the lines outlined  above, using the Raptor process documentation developed by Lisa and recently  updated by Gordon.  We recently [like yesterday] received closing books on Raptor 3 and  distributed those. If Anyone needs documentation on the other 3 structures,  let us know....[Realizing that they are about to change due to the planned  merger of Raptor 1, 2 and 4 into Mega-Raptor -- sounds like a bad Rug-Rats  movie I recently had the misfortune of viewing doesn't it?]  -----Original Message----- From:  Cook, Mary   Sent: Wednesday, February 28, 2001 8:29 AM To: Shackleton, Sara Cc: Ephross, Joel Subject: Re: assignment of trade to Raptor vehicle  No.  I guess the first step is to know into which Raptor the swaps are moving  and to get Joel to give us a closing book on that Raptor so we can get the  correct parties etc.  Attached is an assignment/assumption document I drafted  for the VPP transaction which might be helpful (of course, it has a lot of  inapplicable specifics) .    We ought to also check with Joel about any  provisions in the rest of the vehicle docs that may apply to an assignment.   I would think that if all parties join and consent and provide no ED or TE  under the ISDAs shall occur on the basis of the assignment that it would be  clean from the ISDA point of view.

Senator Schumer offered an amendment reflecting the majority of our amendment package.  The Schumer Amendment was adopted except for provisions relating to Section 708 which received objection by Senator Grassley.  Schumer's staff indicated they will attempt to work this out w/Grassley before floor consideration tomorrow.  House Activity - The House Rules Committee made in order the Oxley-LaFalce amendment, which reflects the majority of our netting amendment package. Better news is that the amendment is alloted only 10 minutes of debate. Note that the Financial Services Committee was not able to get language on Section 708 and the SEC savings language included in the legislation due to objection by the House Judiciary Committee. The amendment will be offered on the House floor tomorrow.  Attached is the Oxley Amendment filed with the Rules Committee and the letter we circulated to Chairman Drier, House Leadership, and contacts on the Financial Services, Judiciary and Agriculture Committees.  The SEC issue prevented release of our letter earlier because they would not authorize PWG agreement without the savings clause language.  They were convinced to withdraw their objection on a promise that the Financial Services Committee would work to get this language adopted in conference. Additionally, we understand that Chairman Sensenbrenner may grumble about the Oxley amendment but will not raise any formal objection.  To the extent you are able I would recommend sharing our letter with any contacts you have with Members that are inclined to be involved in tomorrow's debate and are inclined to be helpful -- particularly those on the Financial Services and Judiciary Committees.  Note:  Due to the SEC snafu we were not able to circulate the letter to the Senate today.  We are attempting to rework the letter to reflect the Schumer amendment in hope that it still may be useful tomorrow.        - HR333_002.PDF  - Netting Amendments.doc",carol.clair@enron.com,mark.taylor@enron.com,Bankruptcy Update,2001-02-28 08:45:00-08:00,received

"Yes, my recollection is that Janelle was negotiating a deal with these guys  in January, 2001.  I had conversations with David Adams and Grant Adamson but  I can't recall if the swaption was ever executed.  I discussed the  confirmation problem with David and noted that a small percentage of confirms  were being marked  inconsistently (in Dec., 2000) after months of trading  without any changes at all.  He was too busy to focus (and was a new lawyer,  I think, which is why changes were appearing in the omnibus).

"In the past few weeks, I have discussed this issue with Brent H., Mark T.  Chris G. and Mary C.  Under the PPSA jurisdictions in Canada, which includes  Alberta and Ontario among others, cash held on deposit as collateral is not  clearly categorized as ""money"" but more likely an ""account"".  Although  certain categories of collateral can be perfected by possession, including  ""money"", ""intangibles"", which includes ""accounts"", cannot be perfected by  possession.  The issue comes down to whether we will accept the risk that a  wire transfer to an account designated by us constitutes ""money"".  Although  it is not clear, the better view is that ""money"" means cash in hand and not  on deposit.  The risk is that an unperfected security interest is subordinate  to various parties, including a bankruptcy trustee and to subsequently taken  but properly perfected security interests.  I will admit, however, that this  seems to be a risk that others in our market take (although likely  unknowingly).       Accordingly, to perfect the ""account"" a registration is likely required at  the PPR, which is something we do not want to get into.   Even then, as an ""account"" is an ""intangible"" certain conflicts rules for  perfection by registration need to be considered, as the PPSA jurisdictions  provide that perfection of an intangible is governed by the laws of the  jurisdiction where the debtor is located, as determined by the location of  its principal place of business or chief executive office. i.e.  registration  may be required in some other jurisdiction entirely.  Further, an advance  search would have to be done to see if there are competing prior  registrations.  Also, as the PPR is not a guaranteed title registry,  registration priority does not necessarily guarantee security priority, and  law firms will not typically give priority opinions under the PPSA.    Lastly, if there is an insolvency and the deposit holding institution is also  a creditor of the counterparty, there may be some argument that the deposit  holding institution will assert rights of set off over the account.  In terms of updating advice, the statutory provisions have not to my  knowledge changed.  I suppose there is some possibility that a court has  recently determined that ""money"" includes deposits that we are not aware of,  and I could ask outside counsel to research this issue.

In Stikeman's November 2000 ISDA  Collateral Opinion, they suggest as an alternative course of action to modify  the Credit Support Annex to create a debtor/creditor relationship between the  parties and to provide for an outright transfer of cash instead of a pledge.

"Elizabeth,  Per my voice mail here is what credit wants to explore.  If we have an ISDA  in place with a non-regulated affiliate of a utility, they want to create  some credit triggers that would be based on events that occur with respect to  our counterparty's regulated utility affiliate.  Can this be done?  Could we,  for example, have a drop in the credit rating of the utility trigger a MAC?   Could we cross default to the utility's physical and/or financial  transactions?  I know that there are limitations on what can be done, I just  didn't know how extensive they were.

"I am not sure it solves matters.  Stikemans opinion points out:  1.  as I indicated this morning, ""money"" means actual currency - notes and  coins - not funds transferred by wire into an account, which would likely be  treated as an ""intangible"" resulting in the various requirements/concerns I  pointed to this morning regarding perfection by registration;  2.  although, in their view, the validity of the transfer approach would be  recognized by a court (in Ontario at least), given that the intention of the  Transfer Annex is to provide security for contingent obligations under the  Master Agreement and the lack of relevant case law, there is a material risk  that the Court would nonetheless characterize the transfer as a security  interest subject to the requirements for perfection.  With our present understanding, in the absence of any definitive case law,  and without an unequivocal opinion we can rely on, I am not sure we can rely  on the transfer approach to solve the problem, particularly with high volume  counterparties who likely are going to create the largest exposures.

In Stikeman's November 2000 ISDA  Collateral Opinion, they suggest as an alternative course of action to modify  the Credit Support Annex to create a debtor/creditor relationship between the  parties and to provide for an outright transfer of cash instead of a pledge.   Do you have any thoughts on this?  Is this an alternative that we should  consider implementing with some of our more persistent high volume  counterparties who are giving us a hard time about not being able to post  cash collateral to us?

Chris G. and Mary C.  Under the PPSA jurisdictions in Canada, which includes  Alberta and Ontario among others, cash held on deposit as collateral is not  clearly categorized as ""money"" but more likely an ""account"".  Although  certain categories of collateral can be perfected by possession, including  ""money"", ""intangibles"", which includes ""accounts"", cannot be perfected by  possession.  The issue comes down to whether we will accept the risk that a  wire transfer to an account designated by us constitutes ""money"".  Although  it is not clear, the better view is that ""money"" means cash in hand and not  on deposit.  The risk is that an unperfected security interest is subordinate  to various parties, including a bankruptcy trustee and to subsequently taken  but properly perfected security interests.  I will admit, however, that this  seems to be a risk that others in our market take (although likely  unknowingly).       Accordingly, to perfect the ""account"" a registration is likely required at  the PPR, which is something we do not want to get into.   Even then, as an ""account"" is an ""intangible"" certain conflicts rules for  perfection by registration need to be considered, as the PPSA jurisdictions  provide that perfection of an intangible is governed by the laws of the  jurisdiction where the debtor is located, as determined by the location of  its principal place of business or chief executive office. i.e.  registration  may be required in some other jurisdiction entirely.  Further, an advance  search would have to be done to see if there are competing prior  registrations.  Also, as the PPR is not a guaranteed title registry,  registration priority does not necessarily guarantee security priority, and  law firms will not typically give priority opinions under the PPSA.    Lastly, if there is an insolvency and the deposit holding institution is also  a creditor of the counterparty, there may be some argument that the deposit  holding institution will assert rights of set off over the account.  In terms of updating advice, the statutory provisions have not to my  knowledge changed.  I suppose there is some possibility that a court has  recently determined that ""money"" includes deposits that we are not aware of,  and I could ask outside counsel to research this issue.

They claim that under the current state of the law, holding cash  collateral is the method for perfecting.  Please advise.  Should we ask  Stikeman to update their advice to us on this?

"Elizabeth: I had a question about a recurring provision that I have seen in your Power  Contracts.  Looks like our credit group accepts a Guaranty from a  Counterparty's Credit Support Provider as a form of Performance Assurance to  satisfy any collateral posting requirements.  On the financial side,  Guarantys always supplement the colateral requirements such that we require  them to post cash or LC's to us even if we are holding a parent Guaranty.   Why is there a different approach on the power side?  Alos, how does credit  value a parent guaranty?  For example, if the parent's financial condition  worsens, does the value of the Guaranty drop?

"Sara: In the unlikely event taht you are called tomorrow and they can't reach me  here is where things stand.  After several internal discussions with Paul,  Akasha and Denis O'Connell and based on the information that we have received  from DB thus far, it appears as if our Reference Entity's subsidiaries have  declared a standstill/moratorium with respect to all of their debt.  Our  Reference Entity is the Guarantor of such debt.  We have taken the position  that since the Credit Event must occur with respect to our Reference Entity,  we need proof that our Reference Entity has repudiated its obligations under  its Guaranty.  We feel fairly certain that it has, but DB has not shown us  any proof of this.  Paul is calling the paying agent on the defaulted bonds  to try and find out and we have sent another e-mail to DB requesting proof.  All of the other requirements have been met with respect to the obligations  that DB plans to deliver to us next week to settle the contract.  I just need  to quickly review the Guaranty that supports such obligations to make sure  that it is unconditional.  I expect to see it sometime today.

"Joe and Kim: Sara and  I met with Tanya yesterday and one of the topics that we discussed  was making sure that someone was tracking whether our counterparties were  signing Omnibus Confirms that had credit terms (i.e. Annex B and B-1).  Can  you tell us whether there are any counterparties that aren't signing this  type of confirm?  Because collateral is involved, from a legal standpoint,  the only way that we may be able to enforce our rights vis a vis the  counterparty and/or other creditors is if we can demonstrate that our  counterparty entered into a valid security agreement with us.  I look forward  to hearing from you.

"Mark: I and several other people in our group are concerned about Cheryl's apparent  unwillingness to attend on a consistent basis group meetings (i.e.,  legal/credit meetings and seminars and our legal group meeting) that are  held.  I understand from Sara that today Tana had to go and get Cheryl to  come to the legal/credit meeting.  Last week, she did not show up for the  legal/credit seminar that Brent held.  Could you please talk to her about  this?  I am concerned that she is not plugged into our group and is not  learning and hearing the things that she needs to be learning and hearing.

I'm out this week giving a seminar - the head of the rival power form WSPP  and me Miss EEI are giving presentations on why our documents are the best.   Before that though we have tennis scheduled (he'll kill me but I do have the  better form)  so it looks like we  will have to push it till the week of the  23rd  Any day that week is good.

"Carol:  (1)  see Tanya's note re:  Occidental  (2)  I think I negotiated either a confirm or Schedule with a Trust (I'll try  to find).  Of course, there are lots of structured deals with Trusts.

The question of party representation in conference continues to stall efforts  to bring the issue of bankruptcy reform to a close. Democrats, who occupy  half of the Senate's seats, are insisting upon equal representation in  conference, while Republicans oppose it.  Efforts to forego a conference with the House are unlikely to succeed given  House leadership concerns about a number of controversial amendments the  Senate made to S. 420 before passing it. In particular, many Republicans  object to provisions opposed by President Bush that are intended to make it  harder for debtors to shield assets by purchasing expensive homes in states  that bar creditors from seizing the homes in bankruptcy auctions.  ""There has been no resolution yet,"" Daschle said. ""I would say that I think  both [Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott (R-Miss.)] and I and our staffs are  working to try to resolve his concern, which is what do you do in a tie ...  You know, I think what happens in a tie is [that] you just keep talking until  you break the tie.""  Daschle said he is looking for an ""opportunity to break through,"" but has yet  to find one. Regardless, Daschle said he does not think ""tie votes are all  that big a problem, either in conference or in committee.""  With Daschle voting in the affirmative, the Senate March 14 approved 80-19 a  cloture motion Lott filed late March 12. Sen. Paul Wellstone (D-Minn.), the  bill's most outspoken opponent, argued passionately against cloture and Sen.  Harry Reid (D-Nev.) foiled an attempt by Lott to secure unanimous consent to  prepare the bill for a conference with House members after the bill passed  the Senate March 15.  In general, the bills aim to force more bankruptcy filers to file under  Chapter 13, which requires some repayment of debts, instead of Chapter 7. The  bills are a copy of last year's conference report worked out between the  House and the Senate, which former President Clinton pocket-vetoed in  December.

"Here's a followup note about Select's concerns on termination issues under  Article 5 of the EEI.  I did not have time to get to this, but it should help  wrap up the few outstanding issues on this Master. Regards, Janice  EB3861 Assistant General Counsel, Enron North America Corp. 713-853-1794 (Fax:  713-646-4842) ----- Forwarded by Janice R Moore/HOU/ECT on 05/04/2001 09:37 AM -----   lemelpe@NU.COM  05/03/2001 10:48 AM        To: Janice.R.Moore@enron.com    cc: moonevw@selectenergy.com, morisjr@selectenergy.com    Subject: Re: Enron - Select MPPSA    Janice - Thanks for turning this around so quickly.  John Morissette has all the information necessary to fill out the rest of the cover sheet.  I reviewed the language you proposed for Sections 5.2 and 5.4 to recall what our issues were and where the inconsistencies lie with the ISDA.  Apparently, in Section 5.2, a series of Transactions might be considered Excluded Transactions if they can't be terminated under applicable law on the Early Termination Date, but are used in the calculation of Gains and Losses once they are terminated.  We don't have any objection to this language, but in similar language that we proposed for the ISDA  (for a new proposed Section 6(c)), Enron expressed a concern that this could lead to ""cherry-picking"".  I think the way to solve this is to accept your language for the Master, and limit our language in the ISDA to situations where transactions can't be terminated immediately under applicable law, but not due to market issues.  You should run this by Bob Bruce and Carol St. Clair to see if it helps.  In your new addition to Section 5.4, our concern was with similar language that had been proposed for Part 5(g)(B) of the ISDA, particularly the words ""all other obligations"".  It seemed to me (both in the ISDA and the Master) that such language could be used to allow the Non-Defaulting party to withhold payment that may be due to the Defaulting Party, if the Defaulting Party still owed money or performance to the Non-Defaulting Party.  If this owing of money or performance is what triggered the Event of Default in the first place, than the Non-Defaulting Party has created an opportunity where it never has to make payment to the Defaulting Party.  I don't think this was the intent.  Bob solved the problem in the ISDA by striking the word ""other"" before ""obligations"" and including the words ""(other than those pursuant to Section 6(e)) after the word ""obligations"", which works for me. I suggest that, in the Master, you similarly strike out the word ""other"" and insert after ""obligations"" the words ""(other than those pursuant to Section 5.3)"".  Let me know if this is acceptable. ",carol.clair@enron.com,janice.moore@enron.com,Re: Enron - Select MPPSA,2001-05-04 02:38:00-07:00,received

I have not replied to IBJ and am hoping to get to this this week.  If I have  any questions, in the first case, if you didn't mind I guess it would be good  if I could try them on you.  If this didn't work for any reason, I would of  course be able to address them to your successor.  Re BTM - you may recall that they insisted that we work from their draft. I  need to try and finalize my response to them this week and if I have any  questions, would propose that I deal with them as above.   By the way has your successor been decided?

Attached is the file which you emailed to us last year - I'm not sure if there is a more updated version, so perhaps you can confirm. Also, please forward to me Enron's most recent version of Paragraph 13 to the Credit Support Annex, as we have not reviewed that document.  On review of the attached file received from you on January 9, 2001, I provide the following comments:  Part 3 - delivery of documents, the part requesting Commercial Risks (Party B4s) annual financial statements looks like it needs some clarification. It appears that Enron wants to receive quarterly financials, however we only publish annual statements as a privately held company.  Part 5 - Representations - line of business should be removed for Party B.  The Guaranty language looks fine with the amendments, so I would suggest that be issued and we can check it off our ""to do"" lists.  When we have signed the ISDA Master Agreement and supporting Documents, I will have our General Counsel submit all of the documentation to our Legal Counsel for issuance of the Legal Opinion. I do not foresee any problems in having this issued in a timely fashion.  When the minor amendments referenced above have been made, please forward a final, clean draft of the documents to my attention so we can do a final review and issue the documents for signatures.  I look forward to hearing from you soon.

We had gotten it almost to the finish line, but got  bogged down on a definition of replacement cost.  SDG&E wanted ISO penalties  to be included in Replacement Costs.  As you know, EPMI's preferred  definition of CAISO Firm, and regular Firm, excludes penalties.  We ended up  with an agreement that said we are OK with penalties as long as we are  notified of incurrence of these penalties within 24 hrs.  This language was  the last draft we sent to SDG&E and is attached.    Sharon Firooz called today and wanted to get the EEI back on track.  I  reiterated the above as where we were when the process got bogged down.  I  indicated we are ready to sign based on that last draft.  Or we might be  willing to use an alternative version of CAISO Firm that basically is silent  ton the definition of Replacement Cost.    I would like to arrange a time as soon as possible to get you up to speed on  the issues here so we can get give SDG&E a clear indication of our continued  willingness to execute the EEI with the language indicated on the draft below  as well as perhaps an alternative definition of firm that would be silent on  Replacement Costs.

"Carol,    This is the last correspondence I show with Engage on behalf of Janice (other  than guaranty correspondence) and I can't even find these attachments in her  directory.

EEI Master  Deb: Attached are Enron's revisions to the draft Cover Sheet and Supplement that  you submitted to us.  Peter Leier asked me to work with you on progressing  this master in his absence.   Please note that the credit provisions reflect the discussions that each of  our credit departments have had over the last several months.  The guarantees  referred to here have already been negotiated in the context of another deal  (which will be brought under the umbrella of this Master when it is  executed), and they are due to be executed and delivered by each party very  soon.  We have included our standard provision that will bring all  outstanding transactions listed on  Attachment A under the terms of the EEI  MAster, but we have not included an attachment yet b/c there may be several  outstanding transactions by the time we execute this master.   Also note that my comments have borrowed heavily on the provisions of the  ISDA agreement and schedule that I understand is being executed this week  between Engage and Enron North America Corp.  For example, you had checked  the box on the Cover Sheet electing sec. 2.4 to apply, but that provision  would be inconsistent with the ISDA Schedule 5(e). We believe it is preferable to follow the basic structure of the EEI  documentation as other industry members are doing, leaving the ""boilerplate""  Master unmarked and putting all the changes at the end of the Cover Sheet,  and so that's where you'll see the standard language that Enron adds to the  Master.  We believe that, true to the bilateral nature of these arrangements,  such changes benefit both parties.  Rather than attaching a separate  Supplement, we would add to the Cover Sheet the changes you proposed in the  Supplement after we've negotiated those changes.   Please call me with any questions or comments.

"Ed: We are really close on finalizing the EEI.  The following are open credit  points with them:  1. They want their cross default to be $100 million too instead of $50.  2. They want to exclude from the affiliate definition Florida Power & Light  and its subs.  Their lawyer is sending me a list.  3. They want to raise both collateral thresholds from $20 to $50 million.  4. In the assignment language in section 10.5,  they want to specify a  creditworthiness test in clauses (ii) and (iii), such that if the assignee or  its guarantor is rated BBB- or Baa3, the assignment is permitted.  Clauses  (ii) and (iii) relate to assignments to affiliates and assignments that occur  as a result of mergers or asset transfers.  Right now the test is a generic  creditworthiness test.

EEI Master   Deb: Attached are Enron's revisions to the draft Cover Sheet and Supplement that  you submitted to us.  Peter Leier asked me to work with you on progressing  this master in his absence.   Please note that the credit provisions reflect the discussions that each of  our credit departments have had over the last several months.  The guarantees  referred to here have already been negotiated in the context of another deal  (which will be brought under the umbrella of this Master when it is  executed), and they are due to be executed and delivered by each party very  soon.  We have included our standard provision that will bring all  outstanding transactions listed on  Attachment A under the terms of the EEI  MAster, but we have not included an attachment yet b/c there may be several  outstanding transactions by the time we execute this master.   Also note that my comments have borrowed heavily on the provisions of the  ISDA agreement and schedule that I understand is being executed this week  between Engage and Enron North America Corp.  For example, you had checked  the box on the Cover Sheet electing sec. 2.4 to apply, but that provision  would be inconsistent with the ISDA Schedule 5(e). We believe it is preferable to follow the basic structure of the EEI  documentation as other industry members are doing, leaving the ""boilerplate""  Master unmarked and putting all the changes at the end of the Cover Sheet,  and so that's where you'll see the standard language that Enron adds to the  Master.  We believe that, true to the bilateral nature of these arrangements,  such changes benefit both parties.  Rather than attaching a separate  Supplement, we would add to the Cover Sheet the changes you proposed in the  Supplement after we've negotiated those changes.   Please call me with any questions or comments.  << File: Engage Energy America, LLC CS 3-28-01.doc >>  << File: Engage  Energy America, LLC Attachments.doc >>   << File: EngageEEISUPPLEMENT032701.doc >>  Regards, Janice  EB3811 Assistant General Counsel, Enron North America Corp. 713-853-1794 (Fax:  713-646-3490)  ",carol.clair@enron.com,paul.radous@enron.com,RE: Engage Energy America LLC - Enron Power Marketing Inc.

MESSAGE FROM STEVEN W. SMITH  Stephanie:  Russell Diamond has raised a number of issues on the ISDA Schedule with Terry Gabrielle of Canada Starch.  I have discussed these issues with Mr. Gabrielle and thought it would be helpful if I set out Canada Starch's position on those issues.  You will appreciate that it is important to Canada Starch that its ISDA Master Agreement and Schedule be consistent with those utilized in the Corn Products International family of companies. Accordingly, Canada Starch has very limited flexibility in moving away from the standard form of Schedule prescribed by Corn Products International for use by its subsidiary companies.  1.   CASCO has not defined a cross default amount       CASCO is suggesting a Threshold Amount of Cdn.$10 Million. 2.   CASCO is requesting Market Quotation, as opposed to Market Loss       We have reviewed the arguments for and against the use of Market Quotation versus the use of ""Loss"" and CASCO is of the view that the obtaining of Market Quotations from Reference Market-Makers is the more fair method to use.  Accordingly, CASCO proposes to use Market Quotation, which incidentally is the Corn Products International Standard provision. 3.   CASCO is not including additional cure language for Credit Event Upon Merger       The suggested ""cure"" language of Enron is not consistent with the Corn Products International standard provision.  CASCO's view is that Enron is free to offer these proposed solutions to CASCO in the event of a Credit Event Upon Merger and CASCO will determine whether or not to accept either of these ""remedies"" at that time.  CASCO is not prepared to accept these remedies in advance of such Credit Event Upon Merger occurring. 4.   CASCO is restricting the ability to net payments to only transactions of the same type       CASCO is required to restrict netting on this basis because it does not have the systems in place to net across transactions of different types.   5.   Cross default - CASCO is requesting to aggregate defaults for purposes of determining if the threshold has been exceeded       CASCO's position is consistent with that provided in the Corn Products International standard and we believe is a fair method by which to deal with defaults which may individually be relatively minor in nature but in the aggregate, exceed the Threshold Amount. 6.   CASCO is not accepting affiliate setoff       Once again, affiliate setoff is not contemplated by the Corn Products International standard agreement.  Moreover,  CASCO questions the fairness of binding its affiliates to a setoff provision to which it might not be aware.  Moreover, we have advised CASCO that the legal enforceability of an affiliate setoff provision is questionable.   7.   CASCO, potentially, want to confirm physical transactions under the ISDA       We assume that you are referring to the section of Part 7 Commodity Transactions which contemplates physical settlement.  If that is the case, CASCO has put forward this provision because it is consistent with the Corn Products International standard. 8.   CASCO has not included transfer, applicable rate and limitation of liability language in the schedule       Each of these items were excluded because they are not consistent with the Corn Products International standard.  With respect to the transfer provisions, CASCO is of the view that it is prepared to consider a transfer request from Enron once it knows the particular circumstances of the transfer.  CASCO is not prepared to approve transfers in advance of knowing the details, not withstanding the continued existence of a guarantee.       With respect to the change to Applicable Rate, as mentioned above, this change is not part of the Corn Products International standard and it is not clear to CASCO why this change should be made.         With respect to the limitation of liability language, not only is this section not consistent with the Corn Products International standard, but it is also inconsistent with any other ISDA Master Agreement entered into by CASCO.   9.   CASCO is not accepting the Credit Support Annex       It is CASCO's understanding that the ISDA Master Agreement between CASCO and Enron was meant to be based on the creditworthiness of CASCO, without any Credit Support Annex or other form of Credit Support Provider being involved (other than the guaranty of Canada Starch Operating Company Inc.)  Accordingly, CASCO is not prepared to enter into a Credit Support Annex. 10.   There seems to be concerns with Enron's $15MM Guaranty cap       It is CASCO's understanding that the ISDA Master Agreement is meant to be a foundation document for all future Transactions (as defined in the ISDA Master Agreement) which occur between CASCO and Enron Canada Corp.  Accordingly, it seems inconsistent to CASCO to place a limit on the guaranty which Enron Corp. is prepared to provide.  Any such limit would necessarily require CASCO to re-visit the guaranty and the appropriateness of the limit before any subsequent transaction is entered into.  It is CASCO's experience in other ISDA Master Agreements that the guarantees provided by the Credit Support Provider of its counterparty are unconditional as to both time and amount. Stephanie, I hope the foregoing helps explain CASCO's position on the various outstanding issues in the ISDA Schedule.  Taking into the account the foregoing comments, I look forward to receiving your comments on the draft Schedule which I forwarded to you on March 26, 2001.    Lina Tonon Legal Assistant to Steven W.

"Caroline, As I have said from the outset, before we send them an ISDA, we need to  obtain from their Bermuda counsel a legal opinion that gives us the  assurances that we need that (1) all of the Bermuda transactions have been  duly authorized and are enforceable by us against AIG and (2) we have a  perfected security interest in any collateral that has been posted by AIG to  us.  A form of the legal opinion is attached to the confirm.  As to point #1,  we have no way of confirming this on our own and I understand from Brent  Hendry that because of various peculiarities with Bermuda law, our only way  of gaining comfort on this is through the legal opinion process.

The following are open credit  points with them:  1. They want their cross default to be $100 million too instead of $50.  2. They want to exclude from the affiliate definition Florida Power & Light  and its subs.  Their lawyer is sending me a list.  3. They want to raise both collateral thresholds from $20 to $50 million.  4. In the assignment language in section 10.5,  they want to specify a  creditworthiness test in clauses (ii) and (iii), such that if the assignee or  its guarantor is rated BBB- or Baa3, the assignment is permitted.  Clauses  (ii) and (iii) relate to assignments to affiliates and assignments that occur  as a result of mergers or asset transfers.  Right now the test is a generic  creditworthiness test.

I'm not sure if this concept is achievable,  and if it is, in the time frame we're facing.  However, if we can't do a June  swap, then we'll try for a July swap.

"Rod: Do you and Diana have a copy of the ISDA master between ENA and Kaiser?  If  not, here is a summary of some of the Kaiser credit related provisions:   1. $30,000,000 cross default threshold  2. MAC Event of Default - As to Kaiser, a MAC occurs if either an Event of  Default occurs under the 2/15/94 Credit Agreement with BankAmerica or its  credit rating drops to B- or below by S&P and B3  or below by Moody's.  In  each case, if they deliver collateral, no Event of Default occurs.  3. Collateral Threshold equal to ENA's Net Exposure which goes to zero if a  MAC occurs and there is a failure to deliver collateral within 90 days or an  Event of Default occurs.  4. $1,000,000 rounding amounts   With respect to setoff rights, I spoke with David Mitchell about this and if  it turns out that both types of swap transactions are done with the same  Kaiser entity but different Enron entities and the metals ISDA has  appropriate setoff language, then we feel fairly comfortable that upon a  Kaiser bankruptcy filing in the US, we would be able to exercise setoff  rights.

In summary, we need to answer at minimum the following: ? confirmation of which Kaiser entity is financial transacting with MG plc ? volatility of the metal positions that go out to Jan '04 to ensure how  quickly this out-of-the-money position can move ? what type of paper is confirming the swaps (whether long-form confirms or  Master ISDA) ? what credit/legal terms and laws may affect our efforts to establish a  Netting Agreement for UK and US financial  Can you help me in coordinating a meeting with London legal/credit and  Portland credit/Houston legal to discuss pertinent issues associated with a  Netting Agreement between Kaiser (single entity or multiple entities) and  Enron entities (MG plc and ENA) as soon as possible.  Please let me know your  thoughts to the above and who we need to contact to get the above points  addressed.  In Houston legal, Carol St. Clair is available to work on the  drafting of such a Netting Agreement and is speaking with Sara Shackleton  about the concept as well.  Please let me know as soon as possible your comments to the above and in  setting up a conference call to push this forward.

We have a question into our counsel (who has been out sick) on whether we need some form of Board approval for posting collateral.  Our main concern (and the reason we would like a 10- business day time period) is if we choose to provide credit support with a LOC, we don't have the staffing and bank pre-arrangements to be able to put an LOC in place within a shorter period. Since we don't currently exchange collateral, posting a LOC would not be something we do in the normal course of business. As such, if the need should arise, we would like to have sufficient time to allow staff to look at our alternatives and provide the form collateral that best suits the situation.  > -----Original Message----- > From: Carol.St.Clair@enron.com [SMTP:Carol.St.Clair@enron.com] > Sent: Wednesday, May 16, 2001 8:47 AM > To: GRichar@smud.org > Cc: Tracy.Ngo@enron.com; Stewart.Rosman@enron.com > Subject: Re: EEI Changes > > > Gary: > These changes look fine.

"Keith: As we discussed, here is Enron's legal/credit issues list on the ISDA:  1. We cannot agree to cross-acceleration.    2. There is a note that the cross default threshold needs to be discussed.   Enron's $100 million threshold is based on the threshold that its banks  accept in its credit agreements.  3. We prefer elective termination on bankruptcy.  4. We prefer the Loss method.  5. We would like to discuss with you your credit rating test for defining the  ""materially weaker"" standard in Credit Event Upon Merger as well as the  timing for posting collateral as it appears in this provisions as well as the  Credit Support Annex.  We believe that 7 Business Days is too long for  posting an LC.  6. We would like to make the GP of Encore a ""Specified Entity"".  We need to  discuss with you your request to modify the definition of ""Specified  Transaction"" to include physical transactions.  7. In the MAC Additional Termination Event, we would like to propose a cure  through the posting of collateral.  8. We would like to discuss your proposed chnages to Section 13(b).  9. We need to discuss the arbitration language.  10. We would like to understand why you want to change the definitions of  Default Rate and Interest rate.  11. Why do you want to exclude Sections 7.3 trough 7.6 of the Commodity  Definitions Supplement?  12. In the ""Recording"" section we would like to add the phrase ""To the extent  permitted by applicable law"" at the beginning of the last sentence.  13. We cannot agree to No Fault Termination.  14. We cannot accept Surety Bonds as a form of collateral to secure financial  obligations. Looks like LC's would be the only form of acceptable collateral.  15. We need to discuss the credit threshold language as well as the rounding  amounts.  16. We need to discuss what constitutes an acceptable LC Issuer.   I look forward to hearing from you.

"Jack: I will send you an open issues list shortly.  I considered items # 2,3,4,6,  9, 12, 17, 18, 19 and 21 to be credit-related comments, some of which I need  my credit person's input on.  As to the remaining points, here is my response:  1. Let's discuss exactly what language you want in item #1 as I agree with  you on the concept.  2. With respect to item #7,  your interpretation is correct.  3. I am not clear on what your point is in items #9 and 21.  As a general  rule, with respect to setoff rights, to the extent that ENA is the  Non-Defaulting Party and ENA's affiliates have entered into other agreements  with Inland Paperboard and Packaging, amounts owed under those affiliate  agreements can be setoff against amounts owed under the ISDA.  All the  guaranty is trying to say is that the amount guaranteed under the Guaranty  takes into account the exercise of such setoff rights.  4. I'm not sure I understand your point #10.  5. I agree with your point #13.  6. With respect to point #14, collateral is limited to cash and LC's and the  concept of a custodial account applies when someone other than the Secured  Party is holding  the cash collateral.  7. With respect to point #19, we want the ability to convert the LC into cash  collateral when an Event of Default occurs even if we have not yet terminated  all transactions.  Once we have terminated and established a termination  amount, we would only draw to cover that amount if we didn't draw earlier.  8. The ""deemed occurrence"" language  is meant to cover termination events  that occur automatically without either party electing to terminate, such as  in a bankruptcy scenario where automatic early termination is elected.  We  could probably take it out since there is no automatic early termination on  bankruptcy.  I look forward to hearing from you.  My credit person is out this week, but  maybe you and I can make some progress.

"Below is a summary of the surety bond issues that I believe we need to  resolve in order to feel comfortable accepting it as a form of collateral to  secure a counterparty's obligations with respect to physical power purchase  and sale transactions:  1.  Determine whether an issuer can refuse to honor a draw made under a  surety bond if after issuance, it determines that the bond was issued in  violation of the appleton statute.  What type of legal comfort should we  receive from the issuer at the outset to get comfortable that the bond was  validly issued and is enforceable against such issuer?  2. Determine the proper minimum credit rating(s) that should apply to the  issuer.  3. In the form of bond that we were given, the ""Now Therefore"" language in  the third paragraph is not acceptable.  Determine what can be said in its  place to establish the necessary linkage back to the transaction covered by  the Confirmation.  4. Make sure that the bond can be drawn down no matter what type of Event of  Default occurs, even if such event is not related to the transaction that the  bond references.  The Notice of Claim language needs to be written more  generically to accommodate this.   5. Does credit need a ""pre-bankruptcy"" trigger that would require Reliant to  convert all outstanding bonds into LC's or cash collateral?  If so, what  would this trigger be?  Let me know if you have any additional issues.  I will be discussing some of  these with our outside counsel shortly.

"Carol:  I have attempted to incorporate the changes that Jim has incorporated in our  long form power agreement which ENA has suggested to date into the short  form.  Attached please find a sample short form (for the Con Ed market) for  your review.    Please note the following as you review:  1.  The short forms do not contain the optionality relating to our performing  billing services -- all of our midmarket  forms anticipate that we will act  as customer's billing agent and that we will collect all amounts due related  to T&D and the like from the customer (and reflect same on our invoice) and  pass those amounts on to the customer's utility. 2.  I did not include a ""Setoff"" provision in this draft, mainly because the  vast majority of the time, we will not, nor will an affiliate, have another  agreement in place with these customers.  If you feel strongly about our  including a setoff provision, we will do so. 3.  The change in law provision reads a bit differently from the long form --  the thinking here is that the long form language is very lengthy and rather  harsh (and we've had great difficulty selling it in the past).  Taking into  consideration this class of customer, we decided to include certain items,  including our inability to cover our costs due to a change in law, rules or  practices as a ""force majeure event"" in an effort to soften the approach (see  the GTCs).  Also we do not address calculation of a termination payment in  the event of a change in law as the long form does -- again, more in the  interest of ""saving space"" than anything else...

I considered items # 2,3,4,6,  9, 12, 17, 18, 19 and 21 to be credit-related comments, some of which I need  my credit person's input on.  As to the remaining points, here is my response:  1. Let's discuss exactly what language you want in item #1 as I agree with  you on the concept.  2. With respect to item #7,  your interpretation is correct.  3. I am not clear on what your point is in items #9 and 21.  As a general  rule, with respect to setoff rights, to the extent that ENA is the  Non-Defaulting Party and ENA's affiliates have entered into other agreements  with Inland Paperboard and Packaging, amounts owed under those affiliate  agreements can be setoff against amounts owed under the ISDA.  All the  guaranty is trying to say is that the amount guaranteed under the Guaranty  takes into account the exercise of such setoff rights.  4. I'm not sure I understand your point #10.  5. I agree with your point #13.  6. With respect to point #14, collateral is limited to cash and LC's and the  concept of a custodial account applies when someone other than the Secured  Party is holding  the cash collateral.  7. With respect to point #19, we want the ability to convert the LC into cash  collateral when an Event of Default occurs even if we have not yet terminated  all transactions.  Once we have terminated and established a termination  amount, we would only draw to cover that amount if we didn't draw earlier.  8. The ""deemed occurrence"" language  is meant to cover termination events  that occur automatically without either party electing to terminate, such as  in a bankruptcy scenario where automatic early termination is elected.  We  could probably take it out since there is no automatic early termination on  bankruptcy.  I look forward to hearing from you.  My credit person is out this week, but  maybe you and I can make some progress.

"Keith: Thanks for your prompt response.  I can respond to some of your comments.  1. In point #1, I was referring to your change in Part 1(b) which changed  Section 5(a)(vi) from cross default to cross acceleration.  From a credit  standpoint, we prefer a cross default trigger.  2. I will check with Ed on point #2.  3. With respect to points #5 and 14, because of the difficulty in perfecting  an interest in cash collateral in Canada (based on advice from our Canadian  counsel as well as Stikeman's ISDA opinion on this issue), we do not accept  cash collateral from Canadian counterparties.  With respect to surety bonds,  there is a statute in New York called the Appleton Law which prohibits a  surety from issuing a bond to guaranty financial performance.  For this  reason, we do not accept surety bonds as collateral.  4. With respect to point #7, the answer is yes.  All of the other points need to be discussed.

I have inserted some comments/responses on a preliminary basis in the hope that it will help Encore focus on the issues. I have not spoken to Mike Roach on the credit issues since receiving your email.  -----Original Message----- From: Carol.St.Clair@enron.com [mailto:Carol.St.Clair@enron.com] Sent: Tuesday, May 29, 2001 8:57 AM To: keith.ferguson@fmc-law.com Cc: Edward.Sacks@enron.com Subject: Encore Issues List   Keith: As we discussed, here is Enron's legal/credit issues list on the ISDA:  1.   We cannot agree to cross-acceleration. [KF: I assume you are referring to ""Default under Specified Transaction"". Encore's view (and the view of a majority of its counterparties) is that where the same parties have both physical and financial transactions outstanding, a default under one category of transaction is sufficiently significant that it should trigger a default under the other. There may be reasons why Enron feels this is inappropriate, and we would appreciate your comments.]  2.   There is a note that the cross default threshold needs to be discussed.  Enron's $100 million threshold is based on the threshold that its banks accept in its credit agreements. [KF: In the transactions documented in November/December of last year, the $100 million threshold was accepted as a materiality threshold in relation to Enron Corp., and a $50 million threshold was accepted for Epcor Utilities Inc.  I'm not sure why the reduction to $25 million for Epcor was suggested. More importantly, I understand Mike Roach and Ed Sacks have been discussing an alternative, which would be a percentage of net tangible assets, and that Mr. Sacks was going to give that some thought.  3.   We prefer elective termination on bankruptcy. [KF: Our concern is that creates a risk for the non-insolvent party in relation to other creditors of the bankrupt party who may have automatic termination clauses in their agreements. The short-form agreements signed in late 2000 appear to accept automatic termination.]  4.   We prefer the Loss method. [KF: Are you opposed to the non-defaulting party having the choice between Loss and Market Quotation?}  5.   We would like to discuss with you your credit rating test for defining the ""materially weaker"" standard in Credit Event Upon Merger as well as the timing for posting collateral as it appears in this provisions as well as the Credit Support Annex.  We believe that 7 Business Days is too long for posting an LC. [KF: I need to discuss the first point with Mike Roach. With respect to the second point, we are advised by Epcor's treasury group that the time frame is necessary, and that is part of the reason we wish to have cash qualify as Eligible Collateral; if the time frame is required to produce an LC, we would envision putting up cash within, say, a two Business Day period and substituting an LC when it is issued.]  6.   We would like to make the GP of Encore a ""Specified Entity"".  We need to discuss with you your request to modify the definition of ""Specified Transaction"" to include physical transactions. [KF: I assume this is related to your first point.]  7.   In the MAC Additional Termination Event, we would like to propose a cure through the posting of collateral. [KF: Agreed; I assume the value would be an amount determined by the other party, acting reasonably?]  8.   We would like to discuss your proposed chnages to Section 13(b). [KF: If Alberta law is to apply, we thought Alberta courts should have jurisdiction. I understand that both parties have offices and conduct business in Alberta.]  9.   We need to discuss the arbitration language. [KF: For background, this language was proposed by Enron and is consistent with the approach taken in the prior agreements.]  10.  We would like to understand why you want to change the definitions of Default Rate and Interest rate. [KF: Again, this was done to ""Canadianize"" the agreement. References to U.S. rates when the currency is Canadian dollars didn't seem appropriate.]  11.  Why do you want to exclude Sections 7.3 trough 7.6 of the Commodity Definitions Supplement? [KF: I intended only to modify them as set out in the Schedule.]  12.  In the ""Recording"" section we would like to add the phrase ""To the extent permitted by applicable law"" at the beginning of the last sentence. [KF: Agreed.]  13.  We cannot agree to No Fault Termination. [KF: This is a significant issue. In the event of a fixed for floating price swap and a protracted disruption in the Alberta Power Pool price, my understanding is that Enron would expect the swap to continue with the floating price being determined hourly by quotes from two reference dealers. Our view is that creates a significant risk to both parties that the commercial basis for their agreement will be undermined and that No Fault Termination is the better approach.]  14.  We cannot accept Surety Bonds as a form of collateral to secure financial obligations.   Looks like LC's would be the only form of acceptable collateral. [KF: Mike Roach advised me about the Surety Bond issue. He also advised that Enron has concerns about cash qualifying as collateral because of concerns about perfecting a security interest in cash. Can you outline the concerns?]  15.  We need to discuss the credit threshold language as well as the rounding amounts. [KF: I understand that is part of the discussion between Messrs. Sacks and Roach. I also understand Mr. Sacks is undertaking due diligence concerning what he perceives to be the ""political risk"" in the Alberta marketplace, and that this needs to be completed before the specific credit issues are addressed. Can you confirm?]  16.  We need to discuss what constitutes an acceptable LC Issuer. [KF: I expect both parties have LC facilities established and this point in part involves understanding which banks are involved. If the Epcor information has not been provided, please let me know and I will arrange to have it passed on.]  I look forward to hearing from you.

Chris G. and Mary C.  Under the PPSA jurisdictions in Canada, which includes  Alberta and Ontario among others, cash held on deposit as collateral is not  clearly categorized as ""money"" but more likely an ""account"".  Although  certain categories of collateral can be perfected by possession, including  ""money"", ""intangibles"", which includes ""accounts"", cannot be perfected by  possession.  The issue comes down to whether we will accept the risk that a  wire transfer to an account designated by us constitutes ""money"".  Although  it is not clear, the better view is that ""money"" means cash in hand and not  on deposit.  The risk is that an unperfected security interest is subordinate  to various parties, including a bankruptcy trustee and to subsequently taken  but properly perfected security interests.  I will admit, however, that this  seems to be a risk that others in our market take (although likely  unknowingly).       Accordingly, to perfect the ""account"" a registration is likely required at  the PPR, which is something we do not want to get into.   Even then, as an ""account"" is an ""intangible"" certain conflicts rules for  perfection by registration need to be considered, as the PPSA jurisdictions  provide that perfection of an intangible is governed by the laws of the  jurisdiction where the debtor is located, as determined by the location of  its principal place of business or chief executive office. i.e.  registration  may be required in some other jurisdiction entirely.  Further, an advance  search would have to be done to see if there are competing prior  registrations.  Also, as the PPR is not a guaranteed title registry,  registration priority does not necessarily guarantee security priority, and  law firms will not typically give priority opinions under the PPSA.    Lastly, if there is an insolvency and the deposit holding institution is also  a creditor of the counterparty, there may be some argument that the deposit  holding institution will assert rights of set off over the account.  In terms of updating advice, the statutory provisions have not to my  knowledge changed.  I suppose there is some possibility that a court has  recently determined that ""money"" includes deposits that we are not aware of,  and I could ask outside counsel to research this issue.

One issue that may be of some importance to us in our analysis is determining what the governing law of the surety bond will be for each issuer, and more importantly, whether we can have the bonds governed by Texas law.  Can you answer this for me?  Also, with respect to the form of the bond itself, as we mentioned at the meeting, the language in the third paragraph which states that ""if the Principal shall promptly and faithfully provide the Firm energy as defined in the Confirm, hen this obligation shall be null and void,"" does not work for us.  Has anyone come up with alternative language?  Finally, with respect to the Notice of Claim, we would like for the certification to say something like, ""an Event of Default has occurred under the Master Agreement"" rather than tie it to a specific default under the Confirmation. Does that work for the sureties?  I look forward to hearing from you.

"Marianne: The following are my comments:  1. In Section 1.1, there should be a parentheses after etc. in the 5th line.  2. In Section 3.1, in the last sentence after the proviso insert ""a"" before  the word ""change"" and after the word ""in"".  3. In Section 6.1, change 20 Business Days to 20 days.  Also, add a semicolon  at the end of clause (i).  4. In Section 6.2.1 I'll just note that the discount rate sentence I think is  still an open issue.  5. In Section 6.3, clause (c) should be reworded to fit with the language in  the beginning of the Section.  6. Capitalize the word ""facility"" in the definition of Average Annual Load  Factor.  7. Delete the definition of Costs as it is already defined in Section 6.2.1.  8. Where is the defined term Govt Authority used?  9. In the GTC, the ECP rep should also apply to EESI.  Also, in the 7th line  of the reps add the word ""into"" after the word ""entered"" and before the word  ""this"".  10. In Collateral Requests, insert a comma after deposit in the last line.  I  will also add granting/perfection language.  11. In Events of Default, clause (a) refers to a dispute section which I'm  not sure exists.  In clause (e), delete the ""s"": from the word consolidation.  12. Remedies should be deleted as it is already covered in Section 6.1.  13. In UCC/Disclaimer of warranties, add a clause (c).  I would add setoff language.

Attached please find a sample short form (for the Con Ed market) for  your review.    Please note the following as you review:  1.  The short forms do not contain the optionality relating to our performing  billing services -- all of our midmarket  forms anticipate that we will act  as customer's billing agent and that we will collect all amounts due related  to T&D and the like from the customer (and reflect same on our invoice) and  pass those amounts on to the customer's utility. 2.  I did not include a ""Setoff"" provision in this draft, mainly because the  vast majority of the time, we will not, nor will an affiliate, have another  agreement in place with these customers.  If you feel strongly about our  including a setoff provision, we will do so. 3.  The change in law provision reads a bit differently from the long form --  the thinking here is that the long form language is very lengthy and rather  harsh (and we've had great difficulty selling it in the past).  Taking into  consideration this class of customer, we decided to include certain items,  including our inability to cover our costs due to a change in law, rules or  practices as a ""force majeure event"" in an effort to soften the approach (see  the GTCs).  Also we do not address calculation of a termination payment in  the event of a change in law as the long form does -- again, more in the  interest of ""saving space"" than anything else...  Let us know your thoughts on this document and if you are comfortable with  our using this until such time as the hybrid form is launched.  If you are  comfortable, we will drive these changes into our other midmarket power forms.  Thanks again for your help with this project,  Marianne  P.S.  Please be sure to copy Sarah Dietrich and Jennifer Hillegonds on your  response -- they will be taking this project during my ""hiatus""  --  I am  moving to PA on Friday of this week, and will be out of pocket through  approximately 7/16.  I will start up again in mid-July...     ",marianne.castano@enron.com,carol.clair@enron.com,Re: Mid Market Power Form/ENA Changes,2001-06-01 04:04:00-07:00,sent

We will have to have this wording formally approved by the surety companies prior to issuance.  I would like to avoid approaching the sureties until all questions have been addressed and all changes have been made.  In regards the bonds being subject to Texas law, I do not see that as being a problem.  We will address that with the sureties along with other potential changes.  In response to previous email, neither Dan nor I know of an attorney that would be willing or able to write an opinion in regards the applicability of the Appleton Law.  As discussed during the meeting, this law has nothing to do with the viability of an exisitng surety bond.  If a surety issued a bond that was later found to be in violation of Appleton, they would be fined by the State of New York.  It does not make the bond invalid.

One issue that may be of some importance to us in our analysis is determining what the governing law of the surety bond will be for each issuer, and more importantly, whether we can have the bonds governed by Texas law.  Can you answer this for me?  Also, with respect to the form of the bond itself, as we mentioned at the meeting, the language in the third paragraph which states that ""if the Principal shall promptly and faithfully provide the Firm energy as defined in the Confirm, hen this obligation shall be null and void,"" does not work for us.  Has anyone come up with alternative language?  Finally, with respect to the Notice of Claim, we would like for the certification to say something like, ""an Event of Default has occurred under the Master Agreement"" rather than tie it to a specific default under the Confirmation. Does that work for the sureties?  I look forward to hearing from you.

"Jay: Jeff Hodge forwarded your voice mail to me.  I will give you a call later  this morning to talk about the LC margin language that you need.  It might  help me if you could describe how the margining will work.

In addition, there  is usually some Material Adverse Change trigger that reduces the threshold to  zero.  Is that how yours will work?

We will have to have this wording formally approved by the surety companies prior to issuance.  I would like to avoid approaching the sureties until all questions have been addressed and all changes have been made.  In regards the bonds being subject to Texas law, I do not see that as being a problem.  We will address that with the sureties along with other potential changes.  In response to previous email, neither Dan nor I know of an attorney that would be willing or able to write an opinion in regards the applicability of the Appleton Law.  As discussed during the meeting, this law has nothing to do with the viability of an exisitng surety bond.  If a surety issued a bond that was later found to be in violation of Appleton, they would be fined by the State of New York.  It does not make the bond invalid.

"Jack: Thanks for your e-mail.  I met with our credit people this morning and can  respond to some of the credit points raised in your May 16th memo:  1. With respect to item #2, I know of no case law on this point and our  credit group cannot agree to delete this concept from the Collateral  Threshold definition.    2. With respect to item #3, we can agree to define materially weaker the way  you suggested with  additional language that states that any drop below BBB-  also counts as a trigger.  3. With respect to item #4, we can agree to a definition tied to an objective  rate which my credit person is thinking about.  4. With respect to item #6, I'm waiting for my credit person to confirm that  your comment is correct.  5. I understand from your latest e-mail that no changes will be made to the  definition and use of affiliates in any of the agreements.  6. With respect to item #12, we can agree to increase our rounding amount to  $500,000 and to limit ""returns"" of collateral to once a week.  We cannot  agree to change  the frequency for requesting/delivering collateral.  Given  the high rounding intervals, we feel that unless there is a huge market  change, it is unlikely that collateral requests will be made every day.  7. With respect to item #14, there is no requirement to escrow cash  collateral that is being held and the Secured Party is free to do whatever it  wants to with the cash until the events in 13(g)(ii) occur, in which case the  cash collateral must be held by a Qualified Institution.  8. With respect to item #19, if we draw the entire amount of the LC and the  termination amount that we are owed is less than the LC amount, we would be  required under the documents to return any excess amount to you.  All we are  doing in an Event of Default situation is converting the LC into cash  collateral that we hold subject to the terms of the documents.  9. We can agree to make the chnages that you requested in item #18.  I still need some clarification on the point you were making in item #17 and  I will look at your other comments in today's e-mail and respond shortly.   Are you okay with the Enron and Inland forms of Guaranty?

Attached please find a sample short form (for the Con Ed market) for  your review.    Please note the following as you review:  1.  The short forms do not contain the optionality relating to our performing  billing services -- all of our midmarket  forms anticipate that we will act  as customer's billing agent and that we will collect all amounts due related  to T&D and the like from the customer (and reflect same on our invoice) and  pass those amounts on to the customer's utility. 2.  I did not include a ""Setoff"" provision in this draft, mainly because the  vast majority of the time, we will not, nor will an affiliate, have another  agreement in place with these customers.  If you feel strongly about our  including a setoff provision, we will do so. 3.  The change in law provision reads a bit differently from the long form --  the thinking here is that the long form language is very lengthy and rather  harsh (and we've had great difficulty selling it in the past).  Taking into  consideration this class of customer, we decided to include certain items,  including our inability to cover our costs due to a change in law, rules or  practices as a ""force majeure event"" in an effort to soften the approach (see  the GTCs).  Also we do not address calculation of a termination payment in  the event of a change in law as the long form does -- again, more in the  interest of ""saving space"" than anything else...  Let us know your thoughts on this document and if you are comfortable with  our using this until such time as the hybrid form is launched.  If you are  comfortable, we will drive these changes into our other midmarket power forms.  Thanks again for your help with this project,  Marianne  P.S.

We have tried to incorporate all of the changes and  comments we have received in our last three offsite meetings.  We have left  some questions and open issues in brackets.  I addition, we have highlighted  some areas for extra attention, some of which are explained below:  Section 1.2:  The term of the master is month to month; each transaction will  have a specific term, as set forth in the applicable confirmation Section 1.3:  We need to make a final decision on whether all credit terms  will be in the master or whether some will be in the confirmation Section 1.4:  We have made the usage bands monthly by account; this can  easily be changed if there is business consensus to do so. Section 2.7:  Instead of utility non-performance (physical or financial)  being an event of force majeure, we have added a new section addressing  that.  It provides for a free termination by EES in such event; we need to  consider whether there should be a payment. Section 3.1:  subsections (v), (vi) and (vii) need credit review as indicated Section 3.3:  termination payments are now bilateral (defaulting party gets  paid if non-defaulting party has a Gain). Sections 3.6 and 3.7:  Probably can be shortened while keeping the concepts;  is the first sentence of Sec. 3.7 needed? Section 3.9:  Need input on highlighted language; need to decide whether we  want a bilateral early termination payment here. Special Utility Charges definition: we pass through surcharges here. Assignment: do we want to give customer right to assign without consent in  any circumstances (like to an affiliate)? Confirm: Transaction Term:  need to confirm that this is how we want  start/end dates to be determined.

In Section 1.1, there should be a parentheses after etc. in the 5th line.  2. In Section 3.1, in the last sentence after the proviso insert ""a"" before  the word ""change"" and after the word ""in"".  3. In Section 6.1, change 20 Business Days to 20 days.  Also, add a semicolon  at the end of clause (i).  4. In Section 6.2.1 I'll just note that the discount rate sentence I think is  still an open issue.  5. In Section 6.3, clause (c) should be reworded to fit with the language in  the beginning of the Section.  6. Capitalize the word ""facility"" in the definition of Average Annual Load  Factor.  7. Delete the definition of Costs as it is already defined in Section 6.2.1.  8. Where is the defined term Govt Authority used?  9. In the GTC, the ECP rep should also apply to EESI.  Also, in the 7th line  of the reps add the word ""into"" after the word ""entered"" and before the word  ""this"".  10. In Collateral Requests, insert a comma after deposit in the last line.  I  will also add granting/perfection language.  11. In Events of Default, clause (a) refers to a dispute section which I'm  not sure exists.  In clause (e), delete the ""s"": from the word consolidation.  12. Remedies should be deleted as it is already covered in Section 6.1.  13. In UCC/Disclaimer of warranties, add a clause (c).  I would add setoff language.

Keith: I am okay with the arbitration and non-exclusive jurisdiction language as  currently written as I understand that these concepts were previously agreed  to between you and Mary.  Here is my understanding of the remaining open  issues:  1. Whther termination is automatic or elective on bankruptcy.  You are  considering our request to make it elective.  2. Loss vs. Market Quotation.  We are considering whther we can accept your  proposed language.  3. Time period for posting collateral.  You are considering how long you need.  4. Cash collateral.    I am checking with our office in Canada about this.  5. MAC clause - you are considering whther this should be an Additional  Termination Event with the ability to cure by posting collateral or an event  that reduces the collateral threshold to zero.  6. Default rate definition -  Ed is considering what we can accept in lieu of  the ISDA definition.  7. No Fault Termination - we are considering whether we can accept this.  8. Credit thresholds and Rounding amounts - you and Ed to discuss.  9. Acceptable LC Issuers - Ed to consider whther limiting it to US and  Schedule 1Canadian banks with a certain credit rating is sufficient with  language that the parties can agree to add foreign banks.  Let me know if I misstated and of the above issues.  Thanks.
