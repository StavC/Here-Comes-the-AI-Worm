"Hi Mike,  Great to hear from you.  Would have gotten back to you sooner, but we just  got back from vacationing in California.  Sure was tough to leave  temperatures in the 60s and return to the 90s!  How are things going?  Did they ever implement Modular Forecasting?  Bet you  love those Displays!  Sounds like you guys are pretty busy...too busy to be  speculating about me!  I am in marketing for Enron, using my trading and  financial background.

Michelle,  Since I didn't get to say good-bye, I wanted to see how you were doing?  It sounds like you landed on your feet pretty fast.  To be nosey, were you able to get a severance package and then become employed that quickly?  The speculation around here was that you already had the Enron job (i.e., may have given notice already) and Will severed you because of the soft landing scheduled (heck, I would have loved to be in your situation).  I guess you know that Will officially left the company.  Another speculation was that he tried to garner a severance package himself, but they turned him down (of course he was furious, but I don't know if it was true).  What exactly are you doing with Enron?  Is it in a Marketing role?  Randa mentioned that you are travelling some, but didn't really know what your job function entailed.

Red Cedar may trigger this option anytime before November 30,  2003.  Option fee is an incremental one-tenth of one cent/MMBtu (additive to  the above quoted rates) over the five year term.  Facility Modifications:  The current cost estimate to increase the meter  capacity (from 200,000 MMBtu/d to 300,000 MMBtu/d) at the Arkansas Loop Plant  into Transwestern is $378,000.  * Year 1 capacity of 125,000 MMBtu is  dependent upon the completion of these facility modifications.  Red Cedar  will fund these facility modifications (by a one-time payment of $378,000  payable prior to Transwestern ordering material for the modifications).  In  order to avoid the tax gross-up of approximately $130,000, the $378,000 will  be amortized over the term of the contract and booked as ""pre-paid""  transportation fees.  (The net effect of this will be zero because the slight  increase/MMBtu which will show up on the monthly transportation invoice will  be negated by the corresponding credit for the pre-paid transportation.)

"Great Expectations Forbes - 10/16/2000 BY Lynn Cook Copyright 2000 Forbes Inc.  ENRON INVESTMENT PARTNERS' BIGGEST GAMBLE TO DATE HAS BEEN THE $4 MILLION IT  pumped into Cynet. The software outfit relies on a wireless modem that plugs  in to a laptop or PC and lets you e-mail, fax, and use voice-and  data-messaging. That may not sound like much. But imagine e-mailing thousands  of people at once--or sending a document and following with a prerecorded  message to tell folks to check their fax machines. Cynet is also developing  the ability to retrieve e-mail messages as voice mail on a laptop and to  translate voice mail into e-mail.  The investment helped launch Cynet as the first African-American company to  go public out of Houston. How's it doing? Not so hot. After the initial  offering in January the stock jumped to $8, but it got pummeled in April and  now hovers around $1. It has yet to recover.   Still, Enron is holding on to its investment, now worth only $1.9 million.  Cynet holds the exclusive North American marketing license for Teleran  Electronic's wireless modems. That's got to be worth something. Compaq  Computer is using the technology to add high-speed wireless Internet  connections to its iPAQ Pocket.

"Our Commercial group has definitely used the Deal Analysis system!  The  reports have been very beneficial in quantifying some of our recent  transporting deals on Transwestern.  For example, we executed a one year deal  for 20000/day at our maximum tariff rate, which will generate $4 million  gross margin.  Another one year deal for 8000/day, also to the California  border, will give us over $1 million gross margin.  Two other examples for 11  months each will generate an additional combined $1.5 million.  Hopefully  this will justify our need for this system.  Let me know if you need anything  else.

"Michelle, I thought I would pass this along to make you aware that now EOG  isn't going to supply the EFM at their new location.  Given that they have  yet to contribute the funds requested for our efforts, I don't think we  should spend the money to put measurement out there until they send us the  $10,000.

"Regarding the subject proposed interconnect, where EOG desires to receive 2  MMcfd from TW's 16"" Crawford lateral, the available connection available is a  4"" side valve (formerly used for Highland - Pecos Irrigation,  POI # 500269;  Sect. 10, T23S-R28E, Eddy Co., New Mexico Higland-Pecos Irrigation).  The  former measuring facilities, the lateral, and the 8"" Crawford lateral were  all sold to Duke.  TW measurement facilities do not exist at the interconnect  that can be re-activated for EOG gas lift measurement/regulation.  Should EOG  desire to receive lift gas from TW, then new measuring and regulating  facilities will be required.  See Figure 1 below for connection details.  However, expected operating pressures available on the 16"" Crawford lateral  is common to suction pressures observed at the suction of WT-1 Compressor  Station that varies between 580 - 630 psig (see Figure 2, daily average  pressure graph for May-Oct 2000).  As you indicated that EOG's line pressure  would be near 650 psig, it will not be possible for TW to deliver into EOG  unless they can lower their line pressure to about 550 psig or add  compression.    If feasibility exists for EOG to add compression and you would like for me to  proceed with providing a Level ""A"" cost estimate for measuring/regulating  facilities, please reply or give me a call.

"More info on Allegheny.  Apparently, they're taking funds derived from the= =20 forced divestiture of their utility based generating assets and using them to=20 purchase new IPP plants.  Allegheny (as reported recently) is looking at building a= =20 plant in the Palo Verde area. =20   Allegheny buys Enron plants Allegheny Energy Supply, the unregulated generation unit of Maryland-based Allegheny Energy, showed further proof this week of its aspirations to become a nationwide wholesale power provider, buying gas-fired plants from Enron that serve three regions. Financial terms of the acquisition were not disclosed, but Allegheny will take possession of three peaking units developed by Enron North America: the 546-MW Gleason plant in Gleason, Tenn.; the 508-MW Wheatland plant in Wheatland, Ind.; and the 656-MW Lincoln Energy Center in Manhattan, Ill. Allegheny has been building and buying facilities in Pennsylvania but last month gave the first signal of its broader aspirations, announcing plans to build a 1,080-MW unit in Arizona. The three plants being acquired from Enron all were developed after the 1998 price spikes in Midwest markets, which highlighted the lack of flexible generation in the area. All three entered commercial operation in June 2000. Don Feenstra, vice president of new projects at Allegheny Energy Supply, said the acquisitions fit with the company=01,s broader goal of doubling the original size of its generation fleet (about 8,200 MW) in five years. The three Enron plants total 1,710 MW, swelling Allegheny=01,s portfolio to more than 12,000 MW. Once the first goal is reached, Allegheny wants to increase its generation holdings by another 50% in a second five-year period.  Feenstra said the Enron plants all can be converted to combined-cycle for use over ex-tended periods.",michelle.lokay@enron.com,jeffery.fawcett@enron.com,Allegheny Energy,2000-11-16 01:31:00-08:00,received

"E prime would have interest in the following expansion plans:  1.  Creating a Cunningham/Maddox connection directly from the Linam plant: Dave Engbrock (303-308-6002) would have more information on this idea in terms of volume and rate commitments.  2.  Increasing the CIG/Tumbleweed interconnect capacity from 40,000 to 60,000:  During the summer, e prime flowed up to 15,000 from CIG into TW's PEPL Pool;  if this capacity were expanded, we might be able to get more supply off CIG.  The problem we had this summer was that at times the capacity was reduced to 25,000 due to operational reasons, and that was not enough room for all shippers.  Any additional supply that e prime brings in from this area will most likely go to shippers who already have firm transport to California, or e prime may be interested in shipping this to the Waha area.  3.  E prime would be interested in 10,000/d of capacity from NW Pipeline to Socal Topock--term could be anywhere from 1 to 2 years, rate would be the maximum rate.

The sale  includes two generating units owned by Nevada Power and  rights to electricity produced by three additional units  on the Sunrise site owned by an independent power  producer.    The sale price of the generating station was $106  million, subject to taxes and other adjustments at  closing. In conjunction with the purchase, Nevada Power  negotiated the right to buy energy and ancillary services  from Reliant Energy Power Generation for agreed upon  prices from closing until March 1, 2003, at a cost of $73  million based on time of closing. This will result in a  net price for the generating plant upon closing of  approximately $33 million.    ""With the sale of Sunrise Station, divestiture of  our generation assets is nearly complete. The buyer is a  leader in power generation and has already established a  strong presence in southern Nevada,"" said Walter M.  Higgins, chairman, president and chief executive officer  of Sierra Pacific Resources. ""We'll soon be able to devote  all our resources to building the best energy transmission  and distribution company in the West.""    Sunrise Station consists of two generating units  that can be fueled by natural gas or oil capable of  producing up to 149 megawatts of electricity. The facility  also includes three additional gas turbine generating  units rated at 222 megawatts. These three units are owned  by an independent power producer, Nevada Sun-Peak Limited  Partnership, under contract to Nevada Power. All five of  the units are located on a 38-acre site at the base of  Frenchman Mountain near the eastern edge of Las Vegas.  There are no regular full-time employees at Sunrise  Station.    Sale of the generating assets is a regulatory  condition of the 1999 merger of Sierra Pacific Resources  and Nevada Power. The sale is expected to close in  mid-2001, subject to approval and review by various  regulatory agencies.    The company intends to complete the sale and  transfer of all its generating assets in Nevada in 2001.    Credit Suisse First Boston acted as financial  advisor to Sierra Pacific Resources on the Sunrise Station  sale. Navigant Consulting served as the technical advisor.    Headquartered in Nevada, Sierra Pacific Resources  is a holding company whose principal subsidiaries are  Nevada Power Company, the electric utility for southern  Nevada; and Sierra Pacific Power Company, the electric  utility for most of northern Nevada and the Lake Tahoe  area of California, and a natural gas and water  distributor in the Reno-Sparks area. Other subsidiaries  include the Tuscarora Gas Pipeline Company, which owns 50  percent interest in an interstate natural gas transmission  partnership; and Sierra Pacific Communications, a  telecommunications company.    Reliant Energy and a partner jointly own and  operate El Dorado Energy, a 480-megawatt, natural  gas-fired facility southeast of Las Vegas. In October,  Reliant Energy announced plans to construct a  500-megawatt, natural gas-fired power plant about 20 miles  north of Las Vegas, off Interstate 15.    Based in Houston, Tex., Reliant Energy is an  international energy services and energy delivery company  with $20 billion in annual revenue and assets totaling $30  billion. The company has a wholesale energy trading and  marketing business that ranks among the top five in the  U.S. in combined electricity and natural gas volumes and a  presence in most of the major power regions of the U.S.  The company has nearly 27,000 megawatts of power  generation in operation in the U.S. and Western Europe and  has announced acquisitions and development projects that  will add another 4,000 megawatts.

The sour line would be first be cleaned and tested  for MAOP.  Potential plant connects to this line include the Coyanosa plant  (currently owned by Koch) and Western's Gomez plants.  Potential incremental  plant supplies would be 100-150 MMcf/d of supplies.  Scenario 1:  If Transwestern is willing to be completely at risk for the $2  MM required for the sour line conversion and compression tie-in costs, this  options currently exists and we could move forward.  These costs do not  include the individual plant connections, which could easily be  $400,000-500,000 each.   This would be a relatively high-risk decision.  Scenario 2:  If Transwestern wants shipper contracts to support this project  in part, or in full, the following significant issues need to be considered:     -   Possible ownership changes of the Koch Coyanosa plant to Richardson  Products Company.  There is a moderate to high probability that Richardson  Products Company will purchase the Coyanosa plant, currently owned by Koch.   It is in close proximity to their MiVida system which they purchased last  year and have recently indicated an interest to interconnect with  Transwestern at the Lone Star, Ward location (cost estimates were complete  this week).  Koch has confirmed this rumor of potential acquisition.    Currently Koch has 100 MMcf/d of its own equity gas at the plant, but if the  rumor of the sale of the plant is correct, I may be dealing directly with  Richardson Products rather than Koch.   Another factor to be considered with  this scenario is that if Richardson Products company owns and operates the  Coyanosa plant, they will already have made some strategic decisions about  where their 100 MMcf/d of equity gas will go.   It is possible that through  their MiVida system, Transwestern could have access to this plant gas at  another locational interconnect with Transwestern without having to spend a  penny for the line conversion and connection to the Coyanosa Plant.    Bottom  line is, if Richardson Products does acquire this plant, we needs to take a  step back and look at other scenarios which may be cheaper for accessing this  plant's gas.  - Western Gas Resources contract participation issues:  Western Gas Resources  will eventually have two plants that could be tied into the converted sour  line:  1) Western's existing Gomez plant, and, 2) the newly to-be-acquired  plant sold to them by NNG.   The sale of NNG's Gomez to Mitchell line and the  NNG Gomez plant to Western Gas Resources must occur first.  Western will not  focus its business attention to the possible connection of either Gomez plant  to Transwestern's south-end line prior to this event.  They will eventually  prepare a Declaratory Order to make the newly acquired plant and pipeline  facilities from NNG non-jurisdictional.   NNG & Western have signed the Sale  Agreement and the transfer of funds is expected 1st quarter of 2001 subject  to due-diligence result.  NNG is currently preparing the abandonment filing  for these assets and Western is in the process of their field due-diligence.   Environmental issues (some contamination) relative to the asset sale have  arisen and must be corrected prior to transfer of assets.   All of these  issues may take a good part of 2001 to be resolved.  To Do's:  Monday (when I assume my beautiful, song-bird voice will return), I  plan to discuss the interconnect costs of tying in Richardson's 20"" MiVida  line to Transwestern at the Lone Star Ward location.   We received  Richardson's request for this estimate a couple of weeks ago and the estimate  is about $320,000 (for facilities) plus $100,000 (tax gross-up)*.   In my  conversation, I will try to get Brad Brigham to indicate the timing or  validity of Richardson's possible purchase of this Koch plant.  Once a new  facts can be obtained, it will make the decision making and risk evaluation  process of implementing the Gomez to Puckett tie-in project easier to  understand and take a position on.

"-------- Original Message -------- Subject: FW: Southern Substitutes Date: Thu, 21 Dec 2000 08:14:33 -0600 From: ""Ott, Shana"" <Ott.Shana@epenergy.com>  NOTICE FROM SANTA:  I regret to inform you that effective immediately, I will no longer be able to serve the Southern United States on Christmas Eve.  Due to the overwhelming population of the earth, my contract was renegotiated by North American Fairies and Elves Local #209.  I now serve only certain areas of Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Wisconsin and Michigan.  As part of the new and better contract, I also get longer breaks for milk and cookies, so keep that in mind.  Not to worry-I am certain that your children will be in good hands with your local replacement who happens to be my third cousin, Bubba Claus.  His side of the family is from the South Pole.  He shares my goal of delivering toys to all the good boys and girls.  However, there are a few differences between us such as:  1.  There is no danger of The Grinch stealing your presents from Bubba Claus.  He has a gun rack on his sleigh and a bumper sticker that reads: ""These toys insured by Smith and Wesson.""  2.  Instead of milk and cookies, Bubba Claus prefers that children leave an RC cola and pork rinds [or a moon pie] on the fireplace and Bubba doesn't smoke a pipe.  He dips a little snuff though, so please have an empty spit can handy.  3.  Bubba Claus' sleigh is pulled by floppy-eared, flyin' coon dogs instead of reindeer.  I made the mistake of loaning him a couple of my reindeer one time, and Blitzen's head now overlooks Bubba's fireplace.  4.  You won't hear ""On Comet, on Cupid, on Donner and Blitzen..."" when Bubba Claus arrives.  Instead, you'll hear, ""On Earnhardt, on Wallace, on Martin and Labonte.  On Rudd, on Jarrett, on Elliott and Petty.""  5.  ""Ho, ho, ho!"" has been replaced by ""Yee Haw!"" And you also are likely to hear Bubba's elves respond, ""I her'd dat!""  6.  As required by Southern highway laws, Bubba Claus' sleigh does have a Yosemite Sam safety triangle on the back with the words ""Back off"". The last I heard it also had other decorations on the sleigh as well. One is a Ford logo with lights that race through the letters, and the other is a caricature of me (Santa Claus) peeing on the Tooth Fairy.  7.  The usual Christmas movie classics such as ""Miracle on 34th Street"" and ""It's a Wonderful Life"" will not be shown in your negotiated viewing area. Instead, you'll see ""Boss Hog Saves Christmas"" and ""Smokey and the Bandit IV"" featuring Burt Reynolds as Bubba Claus and dozens of state police cars crashing into each other.  8.  Bubba Claus doesn't wear a belt. If I were you, I'd make sure the wife and the kids turn the other way when he bends over to put presents under the tree.  9.  And finally, lovely Christmas songs have been sung about me like ""Rudolph the Red-nosed Reindeer"" and Bing Crosby's ""Santa Claus Is Coming to Town.""   This year songs about Bubba Claus will be played on all the AM radio stations in the South.  Those song titles will be Mark Chesnutt's ""Bubba Claus Shot the Jukebox"", Cledus T. Judd's ""All I Want for Christmas Is My Woman and a Six Pack"", and Johnny Paycheck's ""If You Don't Like Bubba Claus, Shove It.""

From my perspective, TW needs an agreement because TW is uniquely situated.   Here's why.  - My understanding is that TW is the only pipeline that has been asked to pay  a fee.  - The developers Michelle Lokay and I have been talking to seem very  uncertain about exactly what the fee covers.  -  $50,000 is a lot of money to Transwestern.  -   Transwestern has a recent history of not getting what it thought it had  bargained for from affiliated companies, and would appreciate our trying to  protect them.  I am not trying to create extra work for anyone.  I am just a little confused  about why a contract for TW would necessitate a contract for the other 2  companies.  If you could help me understand, I would appreciate it.    If the consensus is that we feel strongly that TW should not have a written  agreement, then I would at least insist on a detailed letter of intent or  term sheet.  This would force both sides to think ahead about what is  expected.

Also  the Environmental matrix is in the hands of Butch Russell in Albuquerque, so  should be ready this week.  The electrical drawings are being done by Frances  Balderas in Omaha and be ready by this weeks end.  My understanding is that Pogo will build the facility per our spec's and we  will operate it.  They won't purchase materials until their well comes in.   Pogo anticipates the well should be completed in about a week and a half. Just to recap, we will need a chromatograph, sulphur monitor, water monitor,  flow control, positive shut-in and a means of overpressure protection.  The  chromatograph will require commercial electricity.  Operation of the facility  without the above will have to be approved by Rich Jolly. George Kneisley, do you have any input not mentioned above? In speaking with you yesterday, I think all of these are covered, but just  want to make sure.

Per our phone conversation a few days ago it sounded  like the 30 day landowner notification would be the biggest hold up.  What  will be the design capacity for the interconnect?  I think you told me, but I  can't find it in my notes.  My understanding is that there will be a  chromatograph, sulfur monitor, water monitor, flow control and a way to shut  in if pressure reaches our MAOP.  Also, who will own and operate the  station?

"Just to summarize and bring everyone up to speed...I spoke to John Havard with Pogo again.  He would like us to continue with drawings, engineering, etc. using his prepayment.  They have the list of equipment for ordering, but are waiting until the results of the well (hopefully by next week).  They also understand that some of the items could have long lead times.  We are all hoping this will be as successful as EOG's interconnect.

Also the Environmental matrix is in the hands of Butch Russell in Albuquerque, so should be ready this week.  The electrical drawings are being done by Frances Balderas in Omaha and be ready by this weeks end.  My understanding is that Pogo will build the facility per our spec's and we will operate it.  They won't purchase materials until their well comes in.  Pogo anticipates the well should be completed in about a week and a half. Just to recap, we will need a chromatograph, sulphur monitor, water monitor, flow control, positive shut-in and a means of overpressure protection.  The chromatograph will require commercial electricity.  Operation of the facility without the above will have to be approved by Rich Jolly. George Kneisley, do you have any input not mentioned above? In speaking with you yesterday, I think all of these are covered, but just want to make sure.

I'll try to restate them, and add my initial  thoughts, so we can all be sure to focus on the correct problems.    Q 1. Can TW use ""negotiated rate"" agreements for its new 150 mm/d expansion?    A.  Yes.  Independence, Guardian, and other new pipeline projects were  certificated on the basis of negotiated rate contracts.  The only restriction  is that we need to always offer cost-based recourse rate service as an  alternative to negotiated rates.  We hope to use negotiated rate agreements  for the entire 150 mm of capacity, but we won't know until the contracts are  executed how much of it will be negotiated rate contracts and how much of it  will be under recourse rate contracts.  I guess that means that in the cert.  app., we just tell the commission that we will be 100% at risk and that given  the huge interest in the open season, we have no doubts about our ability to  sell the full 150.  We should also tell the Commission we expect to sell the  capacity using negotiated rate contracts or recourse rate contracts or a  combination of both.    Q 2.  Can we give prospective customers a ""cafeteria style"" menu of options  (to steal Jeff's term), like the following:  1.  5 yr. neg. rate deal at a locked in $.60 plus fuel and surcharges (or  whatever number we decide on)  2.  10 y. neg. rate deal at a locked in $.45 plus fuel and surcharges  3.  15 yr. neg rate deal at a locked in $.35 blah blah  4 .  15 yr cost based recourse rate plus fuel and surcharges (importantly  this option is not locked in and will float with TW's actual rate levels and  fuel retainage percentages)  A.  I think the answer here is ""yes.""  Whatever options we come up with for  1, 2, and 3, we will always have to offer 4 as well.  Susan and Steve  Stojic:  please confirm that we have the right to define specific negotiated  rate options and stick to them.  Otherwise, this negotiated rate approach  could get completely unstructured such that we end up with some guys taking  our specific options and other guys custom tailoring weird variations (like a  7 yr, 231 day contract at $.51764, for example).  I'm not sure that would be  a bad thing, but we need to think about it.  We need to be sure we can tell a  customer ""no"" and make it stick if he tries to mix and match by asking for  the 5 yr term and the $.35 rate, for example.  I think we can lay out options  of our choosing and then enforce a ""no substitutions"" policy (this is  sticking with the ""cafeteria"" theme) but we need to be sure.    Q.3.  If we can use the ""cafeteria options"" approach, how much flexibility do  we have in structuring the options?    A:  This one is hard.  We need to be sure that the price and term we choose  to offer for options 1-3 is solely within our discretion.  We don't want to  be second guessed by FERC as to whether we should have offered option 1 at  $.58 instead of $.60.  Susan and Steve: if you guys confirm that we have  discretion in how to structure our negotiated rate options, does that mean we  can slant the economics of the negotiated rate options so they are a better  deal than the recourse option (for most shippers)?  I.e., could we  deliberately  incent shippers to sign on for the short term deals--i.e., by  offering options 1-3 at $.55, $.45 and $.40 instead of the $.60, $.45, and  $.35 shown above.  I suspect that is what Guardian and the other pipes did to  obtain 100% subscription under neg. rate deals.              Q.4.  How do we allocate capacity to customers if demand exceeds supply???  A.  Ideally, we'd be able to allocate the 150 to the guys who want to buy it  the way we'd prefer to sell it.  Under the above example, assuming Stan,  Danny and Steve decide short term deals are better, what if we get 100 mm/d  of offers on each of the 4 rate/term options described above.  That's 400  mm/d of demand for a 150 mm/d project.  Can we sell 100 to the guys who want  option 1 ($.60/5 yrs) and the remaining 50 to the 10 yr/$.45 guys?  That  really hoses the recourse bidders.  Do we have to cover the recourse demand  first and then allocate the remaining capacity pro rata to everyone else?   Pro rata to everyone?  Under the rule that negotiated rate bids have to be  deemed to be at max rate for purposes of allocation, pro rata to everyone may  be the right answer.  Or at least its the answer until we've filled the  recourse rate guys' orders, then we can give the remaining capacity to the  neg. rate guys whose bids we value most highly (using some objective  nondiscriminatory calculation of course).   Ugh.   Susan and Steve--please take a crack at questions 2-4.  I think 1 is answered  already.  I haven't done any research yet, so maybe these questions are  easier than they currently seem to me.  Get me and MKM on the phone at your  convenience to discuss.  We've gotta move quick so the marketers can get out  and sell this stuff.

I think the answer here is ""yes.""  Whatever options we come up with for=  1, 2, and 3, we will always have to offer 4 as well.  Susan and Steve Stoj= ic:  please confirm that we have the right to define specific negotiated ra= te options and stick to them.  Otherwise, this negotiated rate approach cou= ld get completely unstructured such that we end up with some guys taking ou= r specific options and other guys custom tailoring weird variations (like a=  7 yr, 231 day contract at $.51764, for example).  I'm not sure that would = be a bad thing, but we need to think about it.  We need to be sure we can t= ell a customer ""no"" and make it stick if he tries to mix and match by askin= g for the 5 yr term and the $.35 rate, for example.  I think we can lay out=  options of our choosing and then enforce a ""no substitutions"" policy (this=  is sticking with the ""cafeteria"" theme) but we need to be sure. =20  Q.3.  If we can use the ""cafeteria options"" approach, how much flexibility = do we have in structuring the options? =20  A:  This one is hard.  We need to be sure that the price and term we choose=  to offer for options 1-3 is solely within our discretion.  We don't want t= o be second guessed by FERC as to whether we should have offered option 1 a= t $.58 instead of $.60.  Susan and Steve: if you guys confirm that we have = discretion in how to structure our negotiated rate options, does that mean = we can slant the economics of the negotiated rate options so they are a bet= ter deal than the recourse option (for most shippers)?  I.e., could we deli= berately  incent shippers to sign on for the short term deals--i.e., by off= ering options 1-3 at $.55, $.45 and $.40 instead of the $.60, $.45, and $.3= 5 shown above.  I suspect that is what Guardian and the other pipes did to = obtain 100% subscription under neg. rate deals.           =20  Q.4.  How do we allocate capacity to customers if demand exceeds supply???  A.  Ideally, we'd be able to allocate the 150 to the guys who want to buy i= t the way we'd prefer to sell it.  Under the above example, assuming Stan, = Danny and Steve decide short term deals are better, what if we get 100 mm/d=  of offers on each of the 4 rate/term options described above.  That's 400 = mm/d of demand for a 150 mm/d project.  Can we sell 100 to the guys who wan= t option 1 ($.60/5 yrs) and the remaining 50 to the 10 yr/$.45 guys?  That = really hoses the recourse bidders.  Do we have to cover the recourse demand=  first and then allocate the remaining capacity pro rata to everyone else? =  Pro rata to everyone?  Under the rule that negotiated rate bids have to be=  deemed to be at max rate for purposes of allocation, pro rata to everyone = may be the right answer.  Or at least its the answer until we've filled the=  recourse rate guys' orders, then we can give the remaining capacity to the=  neg. rate guys whose bids we value most highly (using some objective nondi= scriminatory calculation of course).   Ugh.=20  Susan and Steve--please take a crack at questions 2-4.  I think 1 is answer= ed already.  I haven't done any research yet, so maybe these questions are = easier than they currently seem to me.  Get me and MKM on the phone at your=  convenience to discuss.

'00 through Feb. '01?  I recall that Enervest and ENA (32/8 MMcf/d respectively) became available on Jan. 1.  Other examples?  PG&E Trading?  I need a complete (as possible) list of when they came available.

"After many conversations with John Havard at Pogo, it was decided that we will not continue with the Transwestern interconnect in the Pronghorn area.  The drilling results were not as optimistic as they originally thought, producing much less than 8,000/day.  Their facilities are also much closer to both a Conoco and a El Paso interconnect of less than 1/2 mile away versus us at 4 miles.  I am assuming we have spent up to the prepaid amount of $35000 and do not need to issue a refund.  If anything changes, I'll let you guys know.

Also the Environmental matrix is in the hands of Butch Russell in Albuquerque, so should be ready this week.  The electrical drawings are being done by Frances Balderas in Omaha and be ready by this weeks end.  My understanding is that Pogo will build the facility per our spec's and we will operate it.  They won't purchase materials until their well comes in.  Pogo anticipates the well should be completed in about a week and a half. Just to recap, we will need a chromatograph, sulphur monitor, water monitor, flow control, positive shut-in and a means of overpressure protection.  The chromatograph will require commercial electricity.  Operation of the facility without the above will have to be approved by Rich Jolly. George Kneisley, do you have any input not mentioned above? In speaking with you yesterday, I think all of these are covered, but just want to make sure.

Per our phone conversation a few days ago it sounded like the 30 day landowner notification would be the biggest hold up.  What will be the design capacity for the interconnect?  I think you told me, but I can't find it in my notes.  My understanding is that there will be a chromatograph, sulfur monitor, water monitor, flow control and a way to shut in if pressure reaches our MAOP.  Also, who will own and operate the station?  Let me know if I'm off base on any of this or what I've missed and also don't hesitate to call if you need anything.  Please let us know as things progress.

"Along the same lines, we could possibly do an EFBH deal with BRT for a portion of their 80,000/d SJ - EOT deal (DP's to WTX).  Again, I'm sure they would argue the obligation to flow warrents a reduction in their rate, but we could look at the economics compared to the cost of facility modifications.  Over the last year, BRT hasn't scheduled less than 70,000/d on average under that agreement.   -----Original Message----- From:  Donoho, Lindy   Sent: Wednesday, March 14, 2001 11:03 AM To: Hyatt, Kevin; Harris, Steven Cc: Schoolcraft, Darrell; Frazier, Perry Subject: WT-1 Capacity  What if we could contract with Agave under the EFBH Rate Schedule for gas from Red Bluff & Bitter Lakes (located north of WT-1 & south of P-1) to deliveries off the south end of the WTX lateral?  Then we could sell westward capacity through WT-1 under Rate Schedule FTS-3.  Agave nominates a total of 50,000/d to 60,000/d from these supply sources into the Central Pool, but this gas does not need to flow through WT-1.  Maybe Agave's existing 40,000/d East could be done under EFBH (if Agave didn't want to commit to incremental firm), but they would have the obligation to flow - I'm sure they would think that merits a rate adjustment.  Anyway, it could be cheaper than some of the options we discussed yesterday or it could be something we would want to do in addition to modifications to WT-1 (for Red Rock & PNM deals).

"** Proprietary **  Michelle:  Thanks for sending this to me so quickly.  I do have a couple more questions for you.  1.  What is the discount rate you will be using to calculate the NPV in your open season?  2.  Can an affiliate of a company also place a bid for up to the volume available to Needles?  3.  How does the right of first refusal work?  For example, when we spoke earlier I think you used an example of a $3.00 bid for 1 year getting equal value as a $.30 bid for 10 years (adjusted for NPV, of course) and the winning party got a ROFR. (Let's say the 1 year bid won).  At the end of the year, is the ROFR calculated on the $3.00 value the shipper holds the transport at or is it based on current market conditions.  Let's say the market value has collapsed and the market views this capacity as worth only $.28/Dth and the current shipper is willing to match that rate does that mean he can retain the capacity?  Then for what term, whatever the market bids that piece for or will there be a set time the (in years) that the  holder of the capacity will have to match regardless of what the bidder bids?  I hope this example makes sense.  If not, please give me a call to discuss at (303) 252-6224.   Thanks for your help.

The next paragraph covers the fact that the stated rate and fuel does not change and this phrase in 4b highlights it to the shipper.   In addition, I think the capacity release paragraph needs modification, since these are greater than max at this time, we TW do not have the right to collect in excess of max rates.  except if we then refile these as negotiated rates??  Not sure what exactly to do but I think this needs reworked.    Notwithstanding Drew's comment to file in support, we could make it that they agree that they will not file anything in oppostion if they file in the docket.  I'm not sure filing now does much for us.  Not a big deal. Since the transactions will be negotiated rate deals,  it is understood that the shipper do not have ROFR rights, correct? Please make sure that Steve Kirk, Glen and Mary D. are included in any routing.    thanks  MK   From: Susan Scott/ENRON@enronXgate on 04/24/2001 04:17 PM To: Drew Fossum/ENRON@enronXgate, Jeffery Fawcett/ENRON@enronxgate, Lorraine Lindberg/Enron@enronXgate, Kevin Hyatt/ENRON@enronxgate, Steven Harris/ET&S/Enron@ENRON, Lindy Donoho/Enron@enronXgate cc: Tony Pryor/ET&S/Enron@ENRON, Mary Kay Miller/ET&S/Enron@ENRON   Subject: RE: Agreement  Good catch.

Contractually, Transwestern currently has 599,500 MMBtu of firm transportation pathed through Station 8.    SoCal Gas' FT allows for 200,000 MMBtu of firm receipts in San Juan and 306,000 MMBtu of firm receipts EOT.  Typically, SoCal baseloads the 200,000 MMBtu each day from the San Juan, so historical use of EOT receipts has not exceeded 106,000 MMBtu.    Eric - If the San Juan Lateral was to go partially or totally down and Socal nominated its 306,000 MMBtu of EOT receipts, given our current contractual obligations pathed through Station 8 and the 150,000 MMBtu Red Rock capacity, would the lower pressure at the junction allow us to move up to 750,000 MMBtu/d from EOT?

"This is to respond to your question on TW/ Conoco at W-1. If Conoco has a line close to WT-1 or they are able to tie to WT-1, I would recommend that they should tie their line to discharge side of the WT-1 Compressor Station and not to the suction. A similar case was recommended to Duke a couple of months ago. The line pressure at discharge side of WT- 1 is 1008 psig.

" Interesting article, especially since it came from Britain...  It does mention Enron too.     The next global city? The blob that ate east Texas Jun 21st 2001 HOUSTON From The Economist print edition (June 23, 2001)  For most outsiders, Texas is a foreign country. Its biggest city, though, might surprise the rest of the world  WHEN a Texan in a big hat tells you how wonderful his home town is, reach for the salt. Bob Lanier, the former mayor of Houston, isn't actually wearing a Stetson as he gazes from his penthouse down on a city that sprawls 25 miles away in every direction. But metaphorically he is. Houston, he claims, could become one of the great cities of the world.  The remarkable thing is that he might be right.  From the time the city was founded in 1836 until the 1970s, Houston doubled in size almost every decade.  Then, despite one of the deepest slumps any city had experienced since the 1930s, the metropolitan area managed to add 1m people in the 1990s to grow to 4.7m, making Houston the fourth-largest city in America.  It is already bigger than Berlin and, with a GDP of around $215 billion a year, has a larger economy than Hong Kong. Because it is the nearest metropolis to the cities of northern Mexico, it may attract another 2m people over the next two decades, which would give it almost the same size of population as London has now.  But a global city? These are few and far between.  Houston can hardly dream of becoming a global financial centre like London, New York or Tokyo. But its business leaders think it could become a cosmopolitan, entrepreneurial hub, a Hong Kong, a San Francisco or even a new Los Angeles. It shares LA's smog, its sprawl, its Latino culture, even its ugly hubris; and by some measures it surpasses LA's ability to reinvent its economy. Can it use its adaptability to turn itself into a properly international place?  Oil be there for you  Its hopes still depend disproportionately on its most global industry. Energy accounts for half of Houston's economy. During the 1970s, while the rest of America stagflated, Houston boomed as high oil prices sucked billions into the country's oil capital. In that decade alone, the city built almost as much new office space as the total amount of commercial property available in San Francisco. Money was being lent and business plans formed on the assumption that oil would go to $50 a barrel. At the height of the boom, about 80% of the city's economy was oil-related.  The bust was traumatic. By the mid-1980s, all that new office space stood empty. Every big local bank was taken over. Only one of the property developers then in business is left.  Unsurprisingly, a certain paranoia lingers in the city about the oil business.  The Greater Houston Partnership, the main business lobby, has spent the past 20 years frantically encouraging the city to diversify. Yet the fact is that the energy business and Houston itself have emerged stronger from the terrible bust.  As company after company was forced to cut back, they collapsed their operations back into Houston and seem unlikely to be dispersed again. In 1999, when oil slumped to $10 a barrel and the number of oil rigs in America fell to its lowest point in living memory, Houston still managed to add energy jobs.  Now another boom is in prospect, with oil prices high again. Matt Simmonds, the head of a local energy consultancy, argues that America's past reluctance to build new power plants will force it to increase energy capacity by around 30% in the next ten or 15 years. The rig count is already 50% above last year, and natural gas exploration is soaring. If oil prices stay high (a big if) and if other countries share America's energy worries, Houston will grow in importance.  It is hampered by a wild-catting reputation. In fact, the energy business is changing in three significant ways, and Houston is the centre of all of them.  First, technology. Not long ago, oil drills went down to 1,500 feet (457 metres). Now they go to 15,000 feet. Companies use four-dimensional computer imaging to plan new fields (time is the fourth). This is making oil an information-intensive business and puts a premium on the kinds of skills available in Houston.  Second, the cost of new oilfield exploration and development has risen so far that even newly merged behemoths cannot always finance them alone. This makes deal-making vital, which is good for the city where deals are made. If you are not attending, say, lunch at Houston's Petroleum Club, you are out of the loop.  Third and most important, oil is now only part of a bigger energy business, which includes electricity. Once divided into self-contained regional markets run by local utilities, the electricity business is being changed by the gradual emergence of a national grid dominated by power producers and traders. Big users now decide whether to buy power at long- or short-term rates, rather as they arrange their financing. A new business of energy arbitraging is emerging, and itscentre is Houston.  Three of the five new skyscrapers going up downtown have as their main tenants energy companies that did not exist ten years ago. One of them, Enron, is building a 50,000-square-foot trading floor?? single-company answer to the Chicago Board of Trade.  Enron has probably been Houston's most successful energy company of the past ten years. It has never explored for, pumped up, or refined a single drop ofoil. Out of the black stuff  However well-placed Houston is to take advantage of the energy business, it will never be a great city as a one-trick pony. Its boosters point to other strengths:  *Trade. Houston is America'ssecond largest port, which is remarkable considering it is 50 miles from the sea.  *Computers. The city is home to Compaq, America's third-largest PC maker. If you include Dell, based in Austin, two of America?? four big computer firms are in south-east Texas, not Silicon Valley.  *Space. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration centre is in Houston, thanks to LyndonJohnson, a native son.  *Medicine. Houston is home to probably the largest medical complex in the world. In a moment of extraordinary optimism, the city set aside 700 acres in the middle of town for medicine. The hospitals, clinics and research centres of the Texas Medical Centre employ 55,000 people and deal with 70,000 patients a day. St Luke's has performed more heart surgery than any other hospital in the world. MD Anderson and the Texas Children's Hospital are among the top two in their respective specialities, cancerand paediatrics.  This list has holes in it. Houston has no real financial services (the mainstay of the biggest global cities) or pharmaceuticals (despite the medical centre). And some of its new industries are less robust than the boosters claim. Its port's success depends on the vagaries of Mexico's economy. Space does not employ many people and is unlikely to grow until the far-off day when the commercialisation of space arrives. The Texas Medical Centre is set up on a not-for-profit basis, so it has not been able to commercialise its activities (hence the lack of drug firms), though a new biotechnology park may help.  In fact, Houston's main hope for diversifying lies not so much in particular sectors as in something intangible: its stunning ability to create new firms.  For the past three years, Houston has created more new companies than any city in America. It is almost certainly the best place either to start a business or find a first-time job. The reasons for this are the real driving forces behind its success. The beauty of entrepreneurialism  The first is unmeasurable, a no-holds-barred optimism of the old school. One survey shows that about two-thirds of Americans agree with the assertion that if you work hard in this city, eventually you will succeed.  But Houston's figure even at the bottom of the city's recession was 75%, and now it is 88%, the highest-ever, and (says the survey's author, Stephen Klineberg of Rice University) the highest of any bigAmerican city.  It may not be true that anything is possible in Houston, but people act as if it were. Bill Gilmer, the chief economist of the Houston branch of the Federal Reserve system, argues that this explains why Houston recovered so fast from the oil bust: unemployed engineers went out and set up their own firms, just as aerospace engineers did in Los Angeles when the end of the cold war put them out of business.  The second advantage is technical. Uniquely for an American metropolis, Houston has no citywide zoning ordinances. When planning decisions are made, they are made by developers on their own land. For the would-be entrepreneur, it is thus easier and cheaper to find a place to set up shop in Houston than in any other city in America.  Lack of zoning laws hands power to developers who insist that new developments be large to capture economies of scale. They expand in leapfrog fashion, ignoring small 20-acre plots near the city centre in favour of vast planned towns further out. This drives land prices sharply down, especially the further you go from the centre. On top of that, an aversion to red tape makes it easy to get building permits. Barton Smith, a land economist at the University of Houston, reckons lack of red tape is at least as important to keep costs low as lack of zoning laws.  Lack of zoning also makes neighbourhoods slightly more mixed in terms of usage (residential and commercial are more muddled up than elsewhere) and racially. Because there are no zoning laws to force, say, a bankrupt restaurant to re-open as a restaurant, areas change shape quickly. At the same time, Houston is less segregated racially than any other city, bymost measures.  One should not be over-impressed by this. Whites in Houston may be more likely than their peers elsewhere to have had a conversation with someone of a different race in the previous week, but that hasn't stopped them heading for the suburbs. Much of the racial mixture downtown is of blacks, Latinos and Asians (the city has America's second-largest Vietnamese settlement after southern California). But because zoning laws do not enable local groups to keep poor people out (for example, by requiring that all housing plots be huge), Houston remains racially desegregated by American standards. This helps draw in immigrant workers, creating a pool of labour.  That leads to the third of Houston's main characteristics which should prove an advantage in the 21st century: racial tolerance. Houston looked like a southern town until the 1970s: white, with a large black minority. A generation later, its population is roughly one-third white, one-third black and (slightly over) one-third brown. Other cities have similar profiles but none went from a bi-racial to amulti-racial city quite so abruptly.  Even more strikingly, it did so peacefully. Houston has not had a race riot since 1914. For the largest southern city to have gone through the civil-rights era and its aftermath without upheaval is a remarkable comment on its politics. Minorities have long been fully or over-represented in the city council, county commissions and the Texas state legislature.  Bob Stein of Rice University argues that, unlike other growing cities, Houston is reinventing the tradition of a powerful group of civic-minded business leaders, the fate of whose companies is closely tied to that of the city. Ken Lay, Enron's chairman, is an example. He has been the driving force behind the building of two sports stadiums, and has a pet project to boost child literacy. Rumour has it that he may run for mayor.  The effect of this sort of civic-minded activism showed up in the late 1990s. At a time when America was busily abolishing affirmative-action programmes, Houston went the other way: it had a new one approved in a city-wide referendum. For better or worse, this showed how racially tolerant it is. For how much longer?  In many ways, Houston is thriving because it has kept alive an old-fashioned, industrial mode of growth, built on cheap land, low taxes, immigrant labour and unfettered pro-business policies. This model may not be enough in the next decades.  Houston is ugly. It was hardly charming to begin with and has pulled down many of its old buildings. It may have to pull down even more after recent floods caused $2 billion-worth of damage. It is also, as Al Gore rudely pointed out during the presidential campaign, polluted. Since cities now have to attract skilled workers with quality of life benefits, this is a big problem, and not one that can be overcome by cheap housing.  Business leaders are frantically trying to catch up. In an unusual example of bipartisanship, a fervently conservative property developer has joined forces with a former member of the Clinton administration to back a $500m bond issue to plant 1m trees. The Greater Houston Partnership has executed an about-turn on pollution. Having argued last year that new pollution controls damage growth, it is now on a crash course to cut ozone-creating emissions as fast as it can.  If this sudden change of mind is real, it poses a tough question about zoning. Houston has 2,300 people an acre, compared with 6,000 in Los Angeles and 20,000 in New York (at the other end of the scale). This extraordinary extensiveness is expensive. At one point in the early 1990s, Houston alone was spending more on roads than any state except California (and, of course, Texas).  There are doubts about how much further sprawl can go. Three-quarters of the best-paid jobs are still on or within the inner ring road. Some new suburbs are 50 miles away. Can the city continue to burst outwards while attracting the skilled people whose jobs are downtown? And surely that means introducing zoning?  Lastly, Houston faces a severe problem in the one area where its national reputation is high: education. To run his number-one priority, Mr Bush picked as secretary of education Rod Paige, a former head of the Houston independent school district. The president claimed, correctly, that Mr Paige had overseen substantial improvements in the city's education, especially among minorities. What he did not say is that these improvements have been nothing like enough.  Despite successes in individual schools, half of all Latinos fail to graduate from high school, compared with 10% of whites and 20% of blacks. Whites are abandoning Houston's public schools. They represent only 12% of pupils; 54% are Latino. More than a quarter of today's schoolchildren are likely to dropout.  In a world where a good job depends on having a college degree, this is alarming. Rice University's Mr Klineberg argues that new immigrants from Mexico arrive lagging further behind the rest of the country educationally than did the wave of immigrants in the early 1900s. The first wave took several generations to catch up. Today's immigrants will have to close a bigger gap more quickly. If they do not, they may end up in an underclass that could scratch at Houston'sracial harmony.  This is Houston  Can Houston make it? The city has experienced the three big transformations that affect America in their purest form: the change from a raw-material economy to services; the change from a bi-racial to a multi-racial place; and the moderation of a no-holds-barred pro-business culture to take account of environmental and social costs. Elsewhere, these changes have occurred over 50 years. Houston has lived through them in 20. And the next 20 years will probably be just as dramatic and successful. Hold onto those Stetsons.

"Building Houston's Future, Enron's 2001 United Way Campaign, officially kicks off today and runs through August 17.  Last year your support helped Enron raise $2.8 million, which was 21 percent more than our original goal.    This year, we hope to reach our employee goal of $2.9 million.  Enron will match every employee's contribution dollar-for-dollar.  We ask that employees who gave last year consider increasing their pledge this year, and that those who did not give, consider making a modest donation.  The decision to focus this year's campaign on Building Houston's Future came directly from our employees, who rallied to help Houston recover from the flood damage caused by Tropical Storm Allison. Enron employees have expressed a strong desire to continue assisting those in need until our city fully recovers.  We will also be focusing on our United Way Scholars program, an innovative program created this year by Enron and the United Way.  The Scholars program builds Houston's future business leaders by targeting talented students who may be overlooked by other scholarship programs.  ON-LINE PLEDGING  We will once again utilize an on-line pledging system to streamline the pledge process that will require your HRGIS ID (shown below). Click on <https://hrglobal.enron.com> or go to <http://home.enron.com> to make your contribution and learn more about this year's campaign. Please make your electronic pledge no later than Friday, August 17.    DAYS OF CARING  We are focusing on flood relief, and on our business units, by replacing the traditional large-scale kick-off event with Days of Caring, which will take place Tuesday through Friday of this week. We invite you to join your business unit for a Day of Caring at your 2001 Adopted Agency. This year's adopted agencies were selected in part due to the amount of flood damage suffered by the agency or its clients. To sign up for Day of Caring, log on to <http://cr.enron.com/cr-cgi-bin/view_volops.pl>.   APPRECIATION LUNCH Rounding out the Days of Caring is an Appreciation Event on Friday, August 10 in Antioch Park from 11:30 a.m. - 1:00 p.m.  Come celebrate the success of Days of Caring, enjoy a free Chic-Fil-A lunch and watch a team of your coworkers compete against the other business units by creating building block structures that exemplify Enron attributes: Smart, Innovative, Bold, Ambitious, and United.  Jackie Martin, President of the United Way of the Texas Gulf Coast, will join us in judging the structures. If you bring down the building blocks that were on your chair this morning and donate them to our 2001 Adopted Agencies, you will be entered in a drawing for two free round-trip airline tickets anywhere in the U.S.  Thank you for your generosity.

Some are self-explanatory while others are somewhat cryptic.  I will follow up with a list that better defines each issue, and you might have your guys think about each as well.  We'll get back together soon (I'm not sure I can do it this week), and discuss an action plan.  - CS 9 fuel - Atoka Lateral  We have both supply and market opportunities within the lateral itself - Turbocharge the Atoka #3 units - Look at Zia pressure obligation on the contract - Agave replacement gas at Atoka #3 - Complete the loop between WT-1 and WT-2 - Coolers to WT-2 - Pecos compressor re-wheel and engine upgrade - 200  300 (WT-2 to Pecos) flow study - Look at Block Valve 16 bi-directional interconnect w/Sid Richardson, and ability flow incremental above 340 on the total system - Look at Keystone into NNG; back to TW south of WT-2 - Check pressure of Stations 6 & 7, and PNM receipts - MAOP restriction on Panhandle leg due to encroachment  Let's talk.

"I just spoke with Elizabeth Brown and she said the agreements have been ""intentionally"" billed as 2-part, knowing they are actually 1-part agreements.

"Did you see the following in the Gas Daily today?  Calif. approves Calpine plant The California Energy Commission on Monday gave the final go-ahead for Calpine to begin con-struction on its 600-MW, natural gas-fired Metcalf Energy Center in San Jose, the company said. The approval follows a two-and-a-half year battle against local interests opposed to the proj-ect, which will be located in power-hungry Silicon Valley. Calpine is partnering with Bechtel Enter-prises to build the plant. The initial tide of local opposition was finally turned by widespread support for the proposed facility from state energy agencies, Gov. Gray Davis and environmental groups. San Jose's city council had initially refused to give zoning approval for the facility but changed tack after the groundswell of statewide support and the seriousness of the state's energy shortage became apparent. ""We have always believed this is an ideal location for a plant, in a region without its own local source of significant power generation,"" Ken Abreu, general manager for joint development for the companies, said in a statement.

"  FERC EXTENDS INVESTIGATION OF NEGOTIATED RATE AGREEMENTS BETWEEN PG&E GAS T= RANSMISSION NORTHWEST AND SHIPPERS, LOOKING FOR EVIDENCE OF MARKET MANIPULA= TION  09/27/2001=20 Foster Natural Gas Report=20 Page 7=20 (c) Copyright 2001, Foster Associates, Inc.=20 FERC issued an order in mid-month September that set for hearing certain co= nsolidated proceedings involving several negotiated rate transactions betwe= en PG&E Gas Transmission, Northwest Corporation (RP99-518) and various ship= pers. The Commission believes closer scrutiny is called for because these t= ransactions appear to provide the opportunity to impose rates many multiple= s in excess of maximum approved tariff rates.=20 The Commission had issued a suspension order in each proceeding that, among=  other things, directed GTN to explain (1) how it had the firm capacity ava= ilable to move gas under the transactions in these proceedings, and (2) why=  its entering into the subject negotiated service agreements did not violat= e regulations and policy regarding firm transportation service and negotiat= ed rate agreements. The new expedited hearing procedures are intended to fu= rther explore these matters. Pending the outcome, GTN must revise both its = tariff and capacity availability postings to provide for clear identificati= on of operational capacity; and must post and contract operational capacity=  on each day of its availability (i.e., on a day-to-day basis), unless it c= an demonstrate such capacity will be available for some longer period of ti= me.=20 Questions Same as Those Addressed to Transwestern Earlier=20 FERC's concerns in this case are remarkably similar to FTS-1 deals recently=  arranged by Transwestern Pipeline Co. (RP97-288) that are now the subject = of an expedited hearing and investigation. Beginning in January 2001, Trans= western made a series of eight filings implementing FTS-1 negotiated transa= ctions with five shippers. The filings were accepted and suspended, subject=  to conditions, by orders issued March 2 and 28 and April 27. Staff issued = data requests to Transwestern , Sempra and Richardson. In the March 28 orde= r, FERC also directed Transwestern to show cause why its negotiated rate tr= ansactions did not violate the regulations. Transwestern answered that the = negotiated rate contracts at issue, and any others for that matter, would n= ot have been any less firm or provided a lower quality of service had shipp= ers elected, instead, to pay the recourse rate. Underlying these transactio= ns, Transwestern said, is capacity that becomes available only for a short = time.=20 In July the Commissioners voted to establish the hearing to further explore=  Transwestern 's negotiated transactions that tied rates to gas spot market=  price differentials between the California border and producing basins in = New Mexico and West Texas. For service to the border, Sempra Energy Trading=  Corp., Richardson Products Co., BP Energy Co., Astra Power LLC and Reliant=  Energy Services elected to pay Transwestern negotiated rates as high as $2= 7/MMBtu compared to a maximum FTS-1 (recourse) rate of 38 cents/MMBtu, excl= uding surcharges and fuel.=20 In Transwestern 's case, the Commission expressed the belief that closer sc= rutiny of transactions that provide the opportunity to impose rates many mu= ltiples in excess of maximum approved tariff rates is necessary: ""Did Trans= western withhold capacity that otherwise could have been made available und= er recourse service in order to make the capacity available under negotiate= d rate charges at substantially higher rates?"" (See REPORT NO. 2346, pp9-10= .)=20 Background=20 Beginning in March 2001, GTN made a series of separate filings pursuant to = its rights to implement various negotiated rate transactions under its FTS-= 1 Rate Schedule with (1) Sempra, (2) Dynegy Marketing and Trade, (3) Relian= t Energy Services Canada Ltd., (4) Western Gas Resources (Western), (5) Ens= erco Energy, Inc., (6) Mirant Americas Energy Marketing, L.P. , (7) BP Ener= gy Co., and (8) CEG Energy Options, Inc.. The filings were accepted and sus= pended, subject to further proceedings by orders issued on 3/28/01, 5/1/01,=  5/31/01, and 6/29/01. The transactions established transportation rates ti= ed to natural gas spot market price differentials between the Northwest Pip= eline interconnection at Stanfield, Oregon and the Pacific Gas and Electric=  Co. and Tuscarora Gas Transmission Co. interconnection at Malin, on the Or= egon-California border.=20 According to the data collected by FERC, the negotiated rate transactions w= ould yield average daily transportation rates many multiples of the maximum=  FTS-1 rate (approximately $0.155/MMBtu, Stanfield to Malin), exclusive of = surcharges and fuel, based on the publicly reported price differentials at = the contract receipt and delivery points during the term of the contracts. = The Commission initiated additional review procedures to further explore qu= estions regarding conditions under which operational transportation capacit= y may be available on the GTN system.=20 GTN has already told the Commission that all negotiated rate shippers knew = service was available at the recourse rate, but that these shippers chose t= o structure the pricing of their contracts in this distinct fashion anyway.=  Further, GTN insists the subject firm capacity was posted as available on = the company's website and EBB, consistent with the Commission's regulations= .=20 Pursuant to the suspension order, FERC received the following information:= =20 - Sempra clarified that 10,000 MMBtu/d of its 20,000 MMBtu/d total capacity=  arrangement with GTN was subscribed at the FTS-1 rate. But GTN insists Sem= pra requested firm backhaul service with the intent of reversing the path. = Under the negotiated alternative, Sempra was persuaded it would not have to=  pay reservation charges on the full MDQ for a secondary, lower priority re= verse path service. In its response, Sempra asserted it wanted to use the c= apacity on a secondary basis and thus chose to negotiate a rate structure t= hat would best reflect its price risk profile to account for the fact that = the capacity may not be available every day. Further, Sempra stated that th= e gas transported was sold into the daily markets at Malin, PG&E's citygate= , or the Southern California border market.=20 - Dynegy's rationale for choosing a rate formula rather than the FTS-1 reco= urse rate was to gain additional value from the capacity. GTN had suggested=  it could enter into a negotiated agreement based on the daily index-to-ind= ex spread because the Stanfield-Malin spread, less fuel, did not cover the = cost of the FTS-1 recourse rate. Based on GTN's information, Dynegy believe= d the price spread was expected to widen and thereby would give it ""a prici= ng opportunity.""=20 - According to Western, it initially sought 20,000 MMBtu/d of capacity at t= he FTS-1 recourse rate, but GTN's response did not allow for the total volu= me to be shipped at that rate. Instead, GTN proposed and Western accepted a= nother price option: 10,000 MMBtu/d at the FTS-1 Recourse Rate and 10,000 M= MBtu/d at the Negotiated Gas Daily Index Rate.=20 - Neither Reliant nor Enserco filed a response to the Commission's 5/1/01 o= rder.=20 - Mirant cited three reasons for choosing the monthly index spread rather t= han the recourse rate: 1) the index spread was easily hedged, 2) at the tim= e the market spread was more desirable, and 3) reduction of market risk. Mi= rant believed there were no other practical options to move gas from Stanfi= eld to Malin.=20 - GTN established four negotiated rate agreements with two different shippe= rs: BP Energy and CEG Energy. The BP Energy agreement was accepted as propo= sed, but FERC accepted and suspended the CEG Energy agreements subject to r= efund and further information. Similar to the other parties, CEG Energy sta= ted that it chose a negotiated rate rather than the recourse rate because i= t believed the index spread was less expensive than the FTS-1 recourse rate= .=20 FERC Has Serious Concerns=20 According to the September 13 order, GTN's negotiated rate transactions und= er investigation ""present several serious concerns."" Even with the addition= al information in hand, the Commission concludes that the filings raise man= y issues that need to be investigated further. Accordingly, an expedited he= aring should explore issues including, but not limited to: whether the tran= sportation capacity was advertised and awarded in an accurate and fair mann= er consistent with GTN's tariff; whether the rates negotiated by GTN were t= he product of an exercise of market power (i.e., did GTN withhold capacity = that otherwise could have been made available under recourse service just t= o make the capacity available under negotiated higher rates); why the shipp= ers agreed to these rates when lower recourse rates should have been availa= ble; and, lastly, whether the practice of improving a shipper's standing in=  the scheduling process by selling firm transportation to undesirable prima= ry points so an alternative point can be nominated is discriminatory agains= t interruptible transportation shippers (since the alternative point is als= o available on a somewhat best-efforts basis).=20 Since the negotiated rate transactions also raise concerns regarding GTN's = posting procedures and its use of firm service contracts for operational ca= pacity, the Commission also spelled out the need to require GTN to undertak= e immediately certain measures to identify more clearly the operational cap= acity available on the GTN system and the period for which such capacity is=  awarded.=20 Finally, the Commission discovered discrepancies between GTN and the other = negotiated parties' representations regarding the capacity quantities avail= able at the FTS-1 recourse rate. Specifically, FERC's concerns go to the Se= mpra and Western rate agreements whereby the parties initially desired 20,0= 00 MMBtu/d at the recourse rate but were provided with a combination of rec= ourse service and a negotiated service. These actions by GTN may reflect th= e exercise of market power and manipulation of the capacity market, the Com= mission surmises.

Bilas on the Gas Industry Restructuring proceeding that has been lingering on the agenda for most of the year.  This was just issued late last week and published today.  I'm still in the process of reviewing it but the good news is that he is proposing the adoption of the Comprehensive Settlement which Transwestern helped design and supported along with most other participants.  The decision does however make some modifications which may not be in our best interest i.e. the adoption of a price cap for secondary market transactions.  Due to the lapse in time on this proceeding, Com. Bilas has granted participants the right to file comments by Friday, October 19, 2001.  Please review and advise if you agree we should file comments (I also have a call into Mark Baldwin).  Note this is 140+ pages--you may wish to review the summary and pertinent sections.  http://www.cpuc.ca.gov/word_pdf/COMMENT_DECISION//10294.doc",michelle.lokay@enron.com,glen.hass@enron.com,FW: GIR Proceeding--I99-07-003,2001-10-17 07:15:08-07:00,received
"FYI   -----Original Message----- From:  Hass, Glen   Sent: Wednesday, October 17, 2001 8:36 AM To: Watson, Kimberly; Lindberg, Lorraine; Lohman, TK; Donoho, Lindy; Dasovich, Jeff; Pryor, Tony; Lichtenwalter, Blair; Lokey, Teb Cc: Harris, Steven; Kilmer III, Robert; Miller, Mary Kay Subject: FW: Bilas , Proposed Decision SoCal GIR  As requested, Mark Baldwin has put together a summary of the Proposed Decision and Comment Points for filing on Friday.  Below are his comments which we can use for discussion purposes at the conference call later this morning.  Having reviewed the Proposed Decision I would agree with Mark's assessment in that while we may prefer that the Commission not modify the Comprehensive Settlement, overall the modifications made should not negatively impact Transwestern.  The Proposed Decision retains two important aspects of the CS for Transwestern:  1)  Unbundling of the SoCal backbone transmission system and receipt point capacity and 2) Retention of primary firm RP capacity of 750MM/d at Needles from Transwestern.  gh     -----Original Message----- From:  <mbaldwin@igservice.com>@ENRON   Sent: Tuesday, October 16, 2001 5:50 PM To: Hass, Glen Subject: Bilas , Proposed Decision SoCal GIR  Glen,  I have reviewed the 10/10/01 Revised PD of Comr. Bilas as requested. In view of the entirety of TW's interest ,I still ascertain that TW can support the current 10/10 PD. Noted below for your information and review is a summary of the Modifications to the CSA that Bilas is currently offering :   1)Market concentration limits reduced from 40% to 30 % of available receipt point capacity. TW has preferred no limits to market concentration historically. However, as before, I do not believe pushing this issue will be successful or productive for TW. There are no market concentration limits in the secondary market. (Although Bilas warns market participants that any misbehavior will be subject to CPUC investigation) P.44  2)SoCal will be required to make available on a daily basis any unutilized firm RP capacity. I don't see any negative impact on TW, perhaps positive. P.45  3)Price Cap for secondary intrastate market set at 120 % of SoCal firm rate. This is the same cap that applies to SoCal. I don't like the precedent set in this area, however it assures that the economic value allocation between SoCal citygate and supply basin will proportionately tend toward the interstate system providers in any tight transport/supply scenario. P.46  4)Not really a change , but Bilas mentions support for Hector Rd. as a delivery/receipt at Ferc.  5)PD does not reduce the core's interstate capacity nor their storage capacities but rather maintains these capacities at current levels. Current level 1044 MMcfd, proposed 1000 MMcfd on the interstate system and current storage 70 BCF, 327 MMcfd of injection and 1,935 MMcfd withdrawal Vs proposed 55 BCF.  I see no clear negative impact on TW from this change.P. 52 &54.  6) CTA's (Core Transport Agents) allowed to reject only their prorata share of non-reliability storage service. No impact on TW interests. P. 58  7) SoCal directed to present(via Advice Ltr.) how the cost of noncore default balancing will be allocated ONLY to those noncore customer using this service and not to the Core customers. I see no impact on TW. P.62  8)PD rejects the requirement that SoCal/SDG&E file an application with a proposal to address core procurement function as the default provider.  I see only positive attributes of this change for TW. P.63  9)Preserves the right for SoCal/SDG&E to seek recovery of expenditures associated with the transfers of customers from Core to Core Aggregator. NO impact on TW. P.66  10)PD orders a 10 % cap on ITCS (stranded cost)responsibility borne by bundled core customers due to unbundled core interstate capacity. No direct impact upon TW interest, however, likely a touchy point with noncore interest. P. 75  11) PD orders that the core contribution to noncore ITCS will end effective the adoption of the PD. Additionally, noncore customers to pay 50% of core ITCS till the end of the core TW and EPNG agreements. No negative impact on TW. Noncore customers bear additional expense. The PD estimates an additional $18 million over next 5 to 6 years. P. 78 The PD provides an estimate of increased stranded cost for the noncore between 01 and 06 to be approx. $ 44.4 Million.  12) PD say NO to an increase in the core brokerage fee of $ 0.0039 (to $2.4 cents). No impact on TW interest. P.83.  13) PD treats Core Subscription service differently on an accounting basis. No impact on TW. P.85-87  14)Generally, the PD makes some administrative changes to the small core/ESP market rules and SoCal services and consumer protection implementation . NO impact on TW interest. P 88-100.  15)Lots of tweaking on how SoCal can recover the cost to implement to services envisioned under the CSA. Owing to the fact that SoCal has already started to ""implement"" portions of the CSA and those cost are accruing to a balancing account etc. Bottomline, not consequential to the approval of the PD. No direct impact upon TW interest. P. 103-110.   On whole the centerpiece of TW's interest in this proceeding remains intact. The SoCal receipt points are unbundled along with ""SoCal backbone facilities"". TW has primary firm RP of no less than 750 mmfcd. Mojave is recognized at only 50 mmfcd firm RP. No receipt point complex is given a preference for capacity expansion. Line 235 appears to remain useful for TW deliveries into the market load centers. The PD modifications to the CSA do not impose upon TW any conditions or costs that would be reason not to support the PD. The parties most affected by the PD are the core aggregators with additional costs and restrictions to service options and noncore customers with additional cost allocations.   Points for comments  1) TW agrees with the PD that the centerpiece of positive changes embodied in the CSA in the creation of firm tradable RP rights. This change in SoCal market structure provides all market participants with the proper tools to build long term supply and transportation contracts.  2) Further adoption of the PD substantially reduces unnecessary market inefficiencies at the California border by providing all market participants with gas scheduling certainty.  3) The creation of tradable secondary rights on SoCal's intrastate system will promote competition and generally lead to stable delivered gas prices.  4) The PD correctly observes that the PG&E market structure which relieves upon an unbundled intrastate backbone system work ""relatively well"" during California's challenging energy markets.  5)TW agrees that the time is ripe for approval of the PD. The energy markets in California have been improving and stabilizing. The Commission promising options are still valid in today's gas market. Further, SoCal is already starting to follow the CSA game plan in their attempts to improve the operating environment on the SoCal system. It is consistent to follow through and make the structural changes required to make permanent these improvements.  6)TW supports SoCal and others whom are approving this PD. (ON THIS POINT, TW SHOULD BE SURE THAT SOCAL IS ON BOARD AS WELL AS OTHER CSA SIGNATORIES, PRIOR TO FILING THESE TYPE COMMENTS)   I look forward to discussing these matters tomorrow on the conference call.

Regent will own 75% of the project, while MEVCO will own the remaining 25%. The estimated cost of the project comes in at $250 million.  Under the agreement, MEVCO will manage the permitting, estimated at 6 to 9 months, and construction process, arranging the equity as needed for same. Regent will be prepared to give up 50% (total) of its 75% net for the financing, netting a 25% interest following the equity/debt financing.  Further terms of the agreement provide that MEVCO will assist Regent in the acquisition of several gas fields in the Four Corners area, San Juan and Rio Ariba Counties of New Mexico, totaling an estimated 90+ Bcf and 20 MMcf/d current production. This production will be sufficient to power 100 MW of the power plant, with the remaining supply to be aggregated from other San Juan producers.  MEVCO Managing Director Phillip Gennarelli noted, ""We are pleased to be involved in this project with Regent. The addition of more producing properties in the area that we bring Regent, coupled with Regent's Horseshoe Gallup holdings, which are in direct proximity with the existing Four Corners Power Plant and the route of the recently announced Sonoran Pipeline venture of Calpine and Kinder Morgan, will provide an unequaled opportunity for both companies.""  Regent President John Ehrman said, ""The additional production from producing properties which MEVCO is assisting Regent in purchasing, currently producing some $1.5 million per month in net operating income, coupled with the additional income through power generation helps Regent to maximize the location of our holdings in relation to the proximity of the existing power plant and transmission lines to key electricity markets in Los Angeles and other western markets. It is a good use of our surface lease, not related to the current proved mineral reserves of the lease.""  The producing oil and properties which MEVCO is assisting Regent in purchasing are in Regent's core area of the Four Corners region near Farmington, NM. Regent will be required to finance the acquisition of the oil and gas proven producing properties under consideration.  Recently, Regent announced that it was in the process of purchasing the interests of all remaining working interest owners in the field, a transaction that is expected to be consummated by the end of the third quarter 2001, giving Regent 100% ownership of the current minerals on the lease.

"Michelle,  We enjoyed the meeting with Transwestern and appreciate your support for our Plan of Reorganization.  We are still looking at a purchase of pipeline capacity from PG&E Topock to your connection with the South Point Power Plant.  The timing has changed from when we met in Houston.  At this time, we will not be including this contract and service to South Point in our FERC filing.  However, we would like you to review the following proposal.  50,000 dth/day of firm capacity on the Transwestern system from PG&E Topock to the Calpine South Point Power Plant. The price is to be $0.05 per dth consisting of $1.395 per dth-month reservation fee and $0.0042 per dth volumetric charge.  The contract will start with CGT acceptance of the FERC Certificate and continue to the end date of the Calpine contract, which is the start of our Section 4 rates.  We anticipate acceptance of the FERC Certificate at the end of 2002.  Our Section 4 rates would start mid to late 2004.    The start of the contract is contingent on the following conditions; PG&E is issued and accepts an FERC Certificate, PG&E is allowed by the FERC to amend the delivery points in the tariff to include the South Point Power Plant and PG&E has a contract with Calpine for deliveries to South Point.

The following is a partial list of items that Williams would like to discuss in our meeting on Wednesday November 14th at 9:30 a.m.  Other questions will probably surface as we move through our discussion.  I would like to start with an overview of the OBA and why the change.  And as we go through the new OBA these questions can be addressed as we get to the appropriate section.  Does that work for you?    1.  Methodology of clearing the ending imbalance as of November 30th. How does WFS  pay back the ""old"" imbalance while also delivering volumes on the ""new"" OBA?  2.  How will payback be scheduled when your line runs full all of the time?   3.  We currently net all of the points in the San Juan area.  Will this still be the case?   4.  How do we handle situations that have occurred multiple times this week where TRW has lost compression.  If this occurs after Intraday 2, how do we makeup during the rest of the month if you cannot accept payback?  5.  When an under delivery occurs, who determines the responsible party and how will the associated volume be excluded from penalty when caused by Transwestern?  6.  What happens when Transwestern accepts Intraday 2 nom increases but cannot accept the physical flow needed to rate out the day?  7.  How do you propose we track separate volumes / imbalances depending on who caused the shortfall?  Please call if my questions need clarification.

Lay's employment agreement with Enron, which is set to expire Dec. 31, 2005, allows the executive to terminate his employment with the company 60 days prior to the Dynegy merger and receive a lump-sum payment of up to $80.8 million, according to a regulatory filing Tuesday.   <http://cbs.marketwatch.com/tools/quotes/intchart.asp?symb=ENE>  According to the terms of the employment contract, if Lay quits before a change of control at the company, he is entitled to a lump sum payment equal to the number of years left in his contract multiplied by $20.2 million.  The agreement also allots an amount to Lay for any tax-related penalties if the lump-sum payment is held to constitute an ""excess parachute payment,"" according to the Securities and Exchange Commission filing.  Lay's original employment agreement with Enron was amended in August when he became CEO after Jeff Skilling resigned.  Enron's ( ENE <http://cbs.marketwatch.com/tools/quotes/detail.asp?view=detail&symb=ENE>) shares fell 4 cents to $9.20 in recent trading.

The following is a partial list of items that Williams would like to discuss in our meeting on Wednesday November 14th at 9:30 a.m.  Other questions will probably surface as we move through our discussion.  I would like to start with an overview of the OBA and why the change.  And as we go through the new OBA these questions can be addressed as we get to the appropriate section.  Does that work for you?    1.  Methodology of clearing the ending imbalance as of November 30th. How does WFS  pay back the ""old"" imbalance while also delivering volumes on the ""new"" OBA?  2.  How will payback be scheduled when your line runs full all of the time?   3.  We currently net all of the points in the San Juan area.  Will this still be the case?   4.  How do we handle situations that have occurred multiple times this week where TRW has lost compression.  If this occurs after Intraday 2, how do we makeup during the rest of the month if you cannot accept payback?  5.  When an under delivery occurs, who determines the responsible party and how will the associated volume be excluded from penalty when caused by Transwestern?  6.  What happens when Transwestern accepts Intraday 2 nom increases but cannot accept the physical flow needed to rate out the day?  7.  How do you propose we track separate volumes / imbalances depending on who caused the shortfall?   Please call if my questions need clarification.

Have a Safe & Happy Thanksgiving Everyone !!     THOU SHALT NOT SKIM FLAVOR FROM THE HOLIDAYS   By Craig Wilson, USA TODAY   I hate this time of year. Not for its crass commercialism and forced  frivolity, but because it's the season when the food police come out  with their wagging fingers and annual tips on how to get through the  holidays without gaining 10 pounds. You can't pick up a magazine  without finding a list of holiday eating do's and don'ts. Eliminate  second helpings, high-calorie sauces and cookies made with butter,  they say. Fill up on vegetable sticks, they say. Good grief. Is your  favorite childhood memory of Christmas a carrot stick? I didn't think  so. Isn't mine, either. A carrot was something you left for Rudolph.  I have my own list of tips for holiday eating. I assure you, if you  follow them, you'll be fat and happy. So what if you don't make it to  New Year's? Your pants won't fit anymore, anyway.   1. About those carrot sticks. Avoid them. Anyone who puts carrots on     a holiday buffet table knows nothing of the Christmas spirit. In     fact, if you see carrots, leave immediately. Go next door, where     they're serving rum balls.   2. Drink as much eggnog as you can. And quickly. Like fine     single-malt scotch, it's rare. In fact, it's even rarer than     single-malt scotch. You can't find it any other time of year but now.     So drink up! Who cares that it has 10,000 calories in every sip? It's     not as if you're going to turn into an egg- nogaholic or something.     It's a treat. Enjoy it. Have one for me. Have two. It's later than     you think. It's Christmas!   3. If something comes with gravy, use it. That's the whole point of     gravy. Pour it on. Make a volcano out of your mashed potatoes. Fill     it with gravy. Eat the volcano. Repeat.   4. As for mashed potatoes, always ask if they're made with skim milk     or whole milk. If it's skim, pass. Why bother? It's like buying a     sports car with an automatic transmission.   5. Do not have a snack before going to a party in an effort to control     your eating. The whole point of going to a Christmas party is to eat     other people's food for free. Lots of it. Hello? Remember college?   6. Under no circumstances should you exercise between now and New     Year's. You can do that in January when you have nothing else to do.     This is the time for long naps, which you'll need after circling the     buffet table while carrying a 10-pound plate of food and that vat of     eggnog.   7. If you come across something really good at a buffet table, like     frosted Christmas cookies in the shape and size of Santa, position     yourself near them and don't budge. Have as many as you can before     becoming the center of attention. They're like a beautiful pair of     shoes. You can't leave them behind. You're not going to see them     again.   8. Same for pies. Apple. Pumpkin. Mincemeat. Have a slice of each.     Or, if you don't like mincemeat, have two apples and one pumpkin.     Always have three. When else do you get to have more than one     dessert? Labor Day?   9. Did someone mention fruitcake? Granted, it's loaded with the     mandatory celebratory calories, but avoid it at all cost. I mean,     have some standards, mate.   10. And one final tip: If you don't feel terrible when you leave the      party or get up from the table, you haven't been paying attention.      Reread tips. Start over. But hurry! Cookieless January is just      around the corner.

"Michelle,   We are looking forward to the planned meeting between BR and TW to further discuss the Window Rock interconnect.  The following is an informal agenda listing of topics:  1.  BR would provide an overview of our November 6th discussions with EPNG regarding the Window Rock Interconnect.    2.   As discussed, it would be beneficial if TW would be able to discuss the operating parameters along TW's pipeline system prior to and after the proposed Red Rock expansion.  In particular, BR would be interested in expected pressures/volumes at Window Rock, Station 4, 5 and Thoreau prior to the expansion and after the expansion with 0mmcf/d, 50 mmcf/d, 100mmcf/d, and 150mmcf/d delivered at Window Rock into TW. The Window Rock deliveries into TW would physically service markets to the west while allowing TW to reduce physical flow from the eastern delivery points by providing the eastern backhaul service to BR.    3.  Discuss potential system or operating modifications to allow Window Rock deliveries.   4.  Review potential alternative delivery points into TW for backhaul service.   5.

This information should include a breakdown of revenues based on existing capacity, Gallup and Red Rock.  Please note that under the transportation section the first subheading is a volume request and the other sub-headings are revenue requests.  We would also like a better understanding of the capacity utilized for each section.  From an operational expense standpoint we need to show the historical breakdown, but going forward we need to assume that TW is a standalone entity. This should include additional costs for ""reverse synergies.""  Also, a breakdown of CAPEX would be helpful.

"This article from NYTimes.com  has been sent to you by jimboman@ix.netcom.com.   I thought you might want to read this. -Jim  jimboman@ix.netcom.com   Trying to Restore Confidence in Enron to Salvage a Merger  November 28, 2001   By RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr. and ANDREW ROSS SORKIN      The Enron Corporation (news/quote) and Dynegy Inc. (news/quote) worked yesterday to find ways to bolster confidence in Enron's weakened energy- trading business as the companies' negotiators continued talks on revising the terms of their merger, executives close to the talks said.   The renegotiated deal would cut the value of the acquisition by half, they said, to roughly $4 billion. Dynegy, they said, was also prepared to invest at least an additional $250 million in Enron, on top of the $1.5 billion cash infusion from Dynegy's biggest investor, ChevronTexaco, included in the initial deal announced Nov. 9. But Dynegy wants the new cash backed by hard assets, and the companies were trying to identify and value enough Enron holdings not already mortgaged to other creditors, the executives said.   Before a series of financial disclosures sent Enron's stock into collapse and the company into the arms of Dynegy, its Houston rival, Enron's natural gas and electricity trading floors did more business than the two largest competitors combined. They also accounted for the majority of Enron's profits by far.   But traders and Wall Street analysts said the business had steadily deteriorated amid questions about the depths of Enron's financial straits. Many traders have curtailed dealings with Enron, and the executives close to the talks said Dynegy officials scouring Enron's books were having difficulty this week figuring out how much cash the trading operation was generating.   The executives close to the talks said that the renegotiated terms for Dynegy's acquisition of Enron would lower the price to about 0.13 Dynegy share for each share of Enron, cutting by half the value of the deal announced Nov. 9, when Dynegy offered 0.2685 share. If a deal is struck at 0.13 Dynegy share, at yesterday's closing prices, Dynegy would be paying about $5.32 an Enron share, a 29.4 percent premium over Enron's diminished stock price. The premium was 20.6 percent over Enron's closing price on the day that the deal was announced.   Both companies are seeking promises from Enron's bank lenders to extend debt repayment dates until after the merger closes. And they are also discussing adding provisions that could limit Dynegy's ability to back out of the combination.   The two companies are also working to arrange a cash infusion of $500 million from J. P. Morgan Chase (news/quote) and Citigroup (news/quote) that would provide Enron with desperately needed new cash.   But there is growing concern that the cash infusion from the banks will not calm investors' fears or reassure energy traders, leading Dynegy to seek an additional $500 million in cash for Enron. Late yesterday, the two companies were hung up over whether Enron, which has already used many of its most prized assets as collateral for loans, has enough assets left to serve as collateral for the additional money, according to executives close to the talks.   A number of Enron assets were being examined, including some that have already been used to obtain other loans, the executives said. The assets include: Transwestern Pipeline, a major natural gas pipeline that links the gas-producing basins of Texas and the Southwest with California; Enron's stake in other gas- pipeline assets; its 9.8 percent stake, worth about $400 million, in EOG Resources (news/quote), a former subsidiary that is now an independent publicly traded oil and gas company; and its indirect stake in Hanover Compressor, which manufactures equipment used to increase the pressure of natural gas and facilitate its flow on interstate pipelines.   Yesterday, investors anxiously awaited a report by Moody's Investors Service, which like other major credit-rating firms, currently ranks Enron's debt at the lowest investment-grade level. If Enron were to lose its investment-grade status, it could be forced to repay or refinance up to $3.9 billion in debt, while other traders would probably further curtail business. But by late yesterday, Moody's (news/quote) decided not to issue a statement after receiving assurances from Enron and Dynegy officials that a renegotiated deal would be announced soon, the executives said. A Moody's spokesman declined comment.   Executives close to the talks said that they hoped that new cash from Dynegy would reassure both Wall Street and the energy-trading markets that Enron's trading floor would survive and remain a valuable asset.   But analysts and investors are having difficulty figuring how much value the trading operation has already lost, and how much the business has been reduced because of credit concerns.   ""I believe Dynegy is probably seeing that deterioration in the core business and wants to renegotiate the purchase price as a result,"" said Andre Meade, head of United States utilities research for Commerzbank Securities in New York. ""I don't think anyone can estimate the earning power of Enron over the next three to four quarters, and I'm not sure Enron has a good estimate.""   Mr. Meade said he did not believe that Dynegy's earlier estimate that the acquisition would add 90 cents a share to its earnings was ""reliable today, given how sharply the business seems to have deteriorated."" By Mr. Meade's calculations, if Enron's trading volumes were to fall 50 percent next year - even if normal volume growth levels returned in 2003 - that would wipe out nearly all the value in the stock.   Karen Denne, an Enron spokeswoman, said the company had experienced a decline in energy trading volume and in the number of traders doing business with it, but both stabilized yesterday. She declined to elaborate or quantify the decline.   She also said that Enron's trading operation remained profitable, though she could not quantify it, and she also said she did not know whether the company was working on a possible bankruptcy filing or other contingency plans should its business and liquidity worsen. ""We're moving forward with the merger,"" she said.   Dynegy officials did not return telephone calls yesterday.   Shares of Enron rose yesterday on news of a possible revised acquisition agreement. They closed at $4.11, up 2.5 percent, or 10 cents. Shares of Dynegy closed at $40.89, up 4.2 percent, or $1.64.   Though yesterday's gains halted a four-day slide in Enron shares, the stock is down 95 percent this year after disclosures of major losses as well as significant accounting errors that led Enron to admit it overstated profits during the last five years by nearly $600 million.   Now, difficulties within Enron's trading operation are exacerbating the company's overall liquidity problems in three ways, according to some analysts and rival energy-trading executives.   First, other traders are requiring Enron to put up greater margin on its trades. On top of that, in some cases Enron's traders are being forced to pay more to buy natural gas than traders at other companies. This credit premium in some transactions has ranged from 3 cents to 6 cents for every million British thermal units of gas Enron buys, these people say.   Additionally, many traders, like the Mirant Corporation (news/quote), have either scaled back or stopped doing business with Enron, hurting its trading revenue.   Mr. Meade of Commerzbank said ""end-use customers and trading counterparties appear to be shifting their business to competitors as a result of Enron's credit concerns and are reluctant to increase their exposures to Enron.""   http://www.nytimes.com/2001/11/28/business/28PLAC.html?ex=1007937624&ei=1&en=efdefb2d568fae37    HOW TO ADVERTISE --------------------------------- For information on advertising in e-mail newsletters  or other creative advertising opportunities with The  New York Times on the Web, please contact Alyson  Racer at alyson@nytimes.com or visit our online media  kit at http://www.nytimes.com/adinfo  For general information about NYTimes.com, write to  help@nytimes.com.

"Steve, below is a partial answer to most of your questions.  Can we set a time for Wednesday afternoon 12/5 to talk?  thanks   Max Hourly Quantity:  we are reviewing capability to deliver the MHQ in a 16 hr block.  Doesn't appear to be any problem.  What will be the plant's complete hourly capability?  Contract Rate:  will be a negotiated rate (eliminates rate risk for Gila).  The rate design is currently one-part (no differentiation between reservation and commodity).  The rate does not include AGA / GRI surcharges or fuel.  It covers a minimal return on the project's capital cost plus the ongoing O&M.  Fuel Rate:  TW does not track and adjust for actual fuel percentages.  Fuel was settled with shippers in the 1996 rate case; the offer to Panda is consistent with the current tariff.  Delivery Term:  as the term gets shorter, the rate by necessity, goes up to cover the return hurdles.  Services:  delivery pressure at the Panda / EPNG interconnect should be a minimum 750 #  Capacity of the lateral from Copper Eagle to EPNG will be 500,000 Dth/d.  Alternative rec/del combinations:  Our thought here was if Panda is willing to commit to taking capacity in the project, then TW would give you all the necessary flexibility to move gas to other destinations at the Contract rate.  For instance, Panda would be paying a one-part rate for delivery to the plant.  If for some reason, plant demand was reduced, then you would have all the flexibility to move gas to alternative markets.    Backhaul:  the 50,000/day would be a guarantee.  Daily imbalances, short notice start up/ shut down:  We have to plan for the worst case scenario and assume there is no storage.  With this in mind, TW will have some flexibility just due to the size of the project (36"" pipe and 750 - 900 # pressure) but this will depend on what other shippers are doing.

In fact, Section 13 (H) of Transwestern's FTS-1 rate schedule indicates that Transwestern could wait until July 31, 2002 to notify PG&E Trading as to the terms of the best offer. PG&E Trading would then have two weeks to notify Transwestern of its desire to match. I, however, suggest that we begin discussions of the outcome of the posting sometime in January.

Gina  Development of Sonoran Pipeline Project Halted  02/15/2002  PR Newswire  (Copyright (c) 2002, PR Newswire)  HOUSTON, Feb. 15 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Kinder Morgan Energy Partners, L.P. (NYSE: KMP) and Calpine Corporation (NYSE: CPN) today announced the termination of the proposed Sonoran Pipeline project. The Sonoran Pipeline was unable to secure sufficient binding commitments to make a successful project given market conditions. Securing firm transportation agreements was a stipulation that executives of both companies initially stated was necessary before development of the project could begin. Neither company has spent significant dollars on the proposed development of the pipeline and it was not expected to begin service until 2004.  Both KMP and Calpine will continue to evaluate other opportunities to serve the growing California market.  Phase I of the proposed Sonoran Pipeline would have extended from the Blanco Hub and terminated near Needles and Topock, Calif., with the possibility of a second phase extending into northern California.  Based in San Jose, Calif., Calpine Corporation is an independent power company that is dedicated to providing customers with clean, efficient, natural gas-fired power generation. It generates and markets power, through plants it develops, owns and operates, in 29 states in the United States, three provinces in Canada and in the United Kingdom. Calpine also is the world's largest producer of renewable geothermal energy, and it owns 1.3 trillion cubic feet equivalent of proved natural gas reserves in Canada and the United States. The company was founded in 1984 and is publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol CPN. For more information about Calpine, visit its website at www.calpine.com .  Kinder Morgan Energy Partners, L. P. is the nation's largest pipeline master limited partnership with an enterprise value of approximately $9 billion. KMP owns and operates more than 20,000 miles of pipelines and over 70 terminals. Its pipelines transport more than two million barrels per day of gasoline and other petroleum products and up to 4.3 billion cubic feet per day of natural gas. Its terminals handle over 50 million tons of coal and other bulk materials annually and have a liquids storage capacity of more than 53 million barrels for petroleum products and chemicals. KMP is also the leading provider in the U.S. of CO2, which is used in enhanced oil recovery projects. ",michelle.lokay@enron.com,kevin.hyatt@enron.com,FW: Article,2002-02-19 08:40:52-08:00,received

We can't be bothered digging into the catalogue to see if the 2,000 workstations are proper ones or just more Compaqs, but then the list gets seriously weird.  ""Fully equipped Techno Gym...

"Weather Trading  Energy and weather are so inextricably tied to one another that it is sometimes hard to separate the two. The demand for power is directly related to temperature going up in summer and going down in winter. If, therefore, you have an unusually cool summer, the demand for power will be much lesser than anticipated, and the same in case of an unusually warm winter. Several electricity utilities enter into power purchase agreements based on anticipated demand, and would face serious financial losses in such cases.  Weather derivatives provide such companies an option to hedge against risk of weather fluctuations. It is no surprise, then, that one of the conferences more lively discussions centered on the presentation by Tom Fletcher, head of weather trading for Mirant <http://www.mirant.com/>.  In describing weather trading, Fletcher reported the market has grown exponentially since it was first formed in 1997. Fletcher highlighted how successful trading requires purchasing the right product. He went on to describe some of the sophisticated products being launched and how Mirant is integrating weather risk into their overall profile and what that means for the traders on the floor.  With presentations from other market leaders such as Centrica, I-Wex, Spectron, Aquila, LIFFE, Mirant, Bewag, Aon and Entergy-Koch, Weather Trading Europe <http://www.eyeforenergy.com/weather/> provided three days of the latest developments in European trading.  The conference touched on key issues surrounding the sector including liquidity in the weather market-where is it and how to access it; data issues-the state of play in European weather data and how you can best utilize the information you've got and a host of other topics designed to help attendees leverage their skills.  As weather trading takes its place in the online world, there is a pressing need to develop greater use of weather derivatives from corporations to avoid the market becoming a predominantly speculative industry.

"   -----Original Message----- From:  ETS Office of the Chairman   Sent: Monday, March 11, 2002 2:09 PM To: DL-GA-all_ets Subject: Severance Summary Plan Description - Domestic Pipeline Assets  We have been working hard over the past three months to restore normalcy to the non-debtor companies in the EGS family of asset-based businesses.   We are doing our best to operate on a business as usual basis, and continue the regular, consistent programs we previously provided.  That is why earlier this year we paid performance bonuses and merit increases to most non-debtor employees, in the ordinary course of business.   At the same time, I understand that events of the past few months have been disturbing and left many with a sense of uncertainty about their future.  We realize that you need some sort of ""safety net"" to allow you to be comfortable staying here as we work to reorganize.  With this in mind, I am pleased to inform you that we have put in place a severance plan for U.S. employees of certain non-debtor companies.  We have wanted this program for some time, but even as a non-debtor company we had to work extensively with consultants and creditors in securing its approval.  The severance plan provides that, under most circumstances, terminated employees would be eligible for two weeks of base pay for every full or partial year of service.  In the case of a termination due to reorganization, the minimum compensation would be eight weeks of pay and the maximum would be fifty-two weeks.  The details and restrictions to this plan are explained in the plan summary for your company's plan, which can be found on the ETS HR link on the Enron Transportation Services intranet site under ""ETS HR Manuals"". It can also be accessed by clicking on the attached weblink:  http://hrweb.enron.com/businessUnits/ets/etsHRmanuals.asp .   I hope this plan will give you a bit more peace of mind and allow you to continue the excellent work you have been providing in our ongoing businesses.  Please contact your HR representative, if you have any questions about the severance plan or related matters.

Questar Pipeline has announced it will shut in its Clay Basin facility from April 2, 2002 through April 15, 2002 and will then perform withdrawal tests on April 16 and 17, 2002.  During this time Northwest will have no access t= o Clay Basin.  Additionally, Transwestern Pipeline has announced that its La Plata Compressor facilities will be shut in from April 2 through April 5, 2002, and will accept no deliveries from Northwest Pipeline.  During the month of March north flow volumes through the Kemmerer compresso= r have exceeded capacity on a regular basis.  With Clay Basin shut in, Northwest's balancing flexibility will be significantly impaired.  Northwes= t will have no place to inject excess gas south of Kemmerer and as a result cannot physically accommodate overscheduled volumes.  If north flow volumes continue to exceed Kemmerer capacity during the Questar and Transwestern maintenance, Northwest will take the following steps to maintain the reliability and integrity of its system: reduce line pack on the south end of its system prior to the maintenance; cut north-flowing alternate gas at compressor station cut points from La Plata to Meacham as necessary to mitigate high line pressures or overscheduling through Kemmerer; take all necessary steps to ensure that gas deliveries from receipt points south of the Meacham compressor closely approximate confirmed nominations;  entitle for undertakes or overtakes, as appropriate= ; and finally, if required, Northwest will issue operational flow orders.  If net scheduled volumes north through Northwest's Kemmerer Compressor do not exceed physical capacity, Northwest will have much greater flexibility during the Clay Basin and Transwestern shut-ins.  Northwest's customers can help themselves and reduce the likelihood that Kemmerer will overschedule b= y securing adequate gas from Canadian suppliers or by using their Jackson Prairie storage during this work.  Northwest will make every effort to reduce the impact on its customers of the Clay Basin and Transwestern shut-ins and will be monitoring the situation closely.  Northwest will take every opportunity to relax system restrictions in later cycles if north flow volumes moderate.  Northwest is confident that if its customers respond prudently, the impact of the Transwestern and Questar maintenance will be greatly reduced.

"FYI, Kim.   -----Original Message----- From:  Frazier, Perry   Sent: Thursday, March 07, 2002 2:25 PM To: Lebeau, Randy; Watson, Kimberly; Abdmoulaie, Mansoor Subject: RE: Re Ivanhoe E.S.D  Just a couple of additional thoughts,  the cost estimate for ESD mods of $130,000 will typically be, about 25% more.  The E&C costs,  company overheads and construction support will increase these costs to around $170,000.  I did talk with Fred this morning and will relay the highlights of our conversation.    The current free flow rates north on this lateral average around 35 - 50 mmcfd.  The gas supply is from the Leedy Plant and various low pressure gathering interconnects.  The gas flows north bypassing the compression unit but utilizing the dehydration unit at Ivanhoe.  The gas end up with NNG on the North side of the lateral,  this Lipscomb lateral is isolated from the TW system at the Canadian River block valve.  The 2 units at Ivanhoe are idle and were designed for higher pressure delivery to NNG.  Since they have not run in some time, its probable to spend an additional $300,000 to activate and upgrade the control panels and end devices.  Then we would most likely have to design and resize the units for an additional guess of $350,000.  In order to abandon these units, I would recommend we abandon in place or Plant Held For Future Use.  My guess is about $15 - 25,000 to pull spool pieces and blind flange the units.  I do know that there is some drilling going on in the area,  I don't see a tremendous influx of supply to support the cost to utilize this lateral any different than the current status.  Let us know your comments.
