Got back into the office today after taking two days off with Sheila and family in Fredricksburg to find a thick envelope from Mertz Ranch Company buried in my ""in box"". Did not know what to expect, had visions of Mertz mailing it back with a note saying forget it. Instead, the lease was signed and dated and had a nice note saying ""thanks"".  Go figure.  We've got a lease for four more years. Same deal, same contract as the last three years, just 6K more a year. Price remains the same this year. next year it is 2k a year per spot and we will need to add one spot. Still waiting on Chet. Would like to know who McCombs would suggest if Chet does not commit. Lease requires Mertz to spent 2k a year on protien feed. He and I can agree in writing to reduce or increase that amount with a corresponding reduction or increase in lease cost. Term is April 1, 2002 to April 1 2005; exclusive right to hunt turkey and deer, spring turkey starting the third weekend in april.  I'm pleased. Hope you are, too.

"it was me. it now makes since why erik was acting like an asshole. Brian, why do you take that shit.  -----Original Message----- From: Brian Constantine [mailto:brianc@saltgrass.com] Sent: Monday, October 08, 2001 9:55 AM To: Fenner, Chet; Erik Wollam; knipe3@msn.com; shudgins@hhw-law.com; Parks, Joe; john.chambers@bisys.com Subject: RE: Karnes City   Has anyone figured out who Erik talked to Friday afternoon...apparently he had a conversation with a person who he thought was me...you know, typical ""man"" talk. I called him and asked him where he was (lots of noise in the background, beer bottles clinking, women hootin' and hollerin', etc.). His reply was, ""Whaddayamean...I'm at the same place as the last time you asked me that."" (Bar) I said , Erik, I havent talked to you all day> He said, ""Really...well I had a conversation for about 10 minutes with someone I thought was you about an hour ago"". Nope, wasnt me!!! ""I guess it was Chad, then. With all this noise (Bar), It is difficult to hear (that combined with apparent beer drinking, added to his confusion) I called Chad moments later to find out what the conversation between Erik and ""I"" was....he verified, as well, that he had not talked to him, either!!!  Now, this is funny. Can you imagine what the conversation was like for the poor bastard on the other end of the line who E thought was me?  Example...Pig references, references to drinking, large breasted bar ""ho's"", shooting and eating things, snide, disparaging remarks intended to disempower, and large amounts of colorful metaphors.   I certainly hope that Erik was talking to one of us, and not some prospective client or business associate. This could be a SNL skit, if done correctly!!! Pretty damn funny....  -----Original Message----- From: Fenner, Chet [mailto:Chet_Fenner@bmc.com] Sent: Monday, October 08, 2001 9:38 AM To: 'Erik Wollam'; knipe3@msn.com; Fenner, Chet; shudgins@hhw-law.com; Joe.Parks@enron.com; john.chambers@bisys.com; Brian Constantine Subject: RE: Karnes City   I'm planning on going this weekend.

"You'll find this entertaining!!!  Rumor Reliant short $300 calls!  -----Original Message----- From: burson@GasTrader.net [mailto:burson@GasTrader.net] Sent: Thursday, October 25, 2001 6:39 PM To: gregory.schockling@bhlp.com Subject: GasTrader Energy Briefs   Daily Market Commentary October 25, 2001  TRADERS SKEWER ENRON . . .   Natural gas futures retreated in busy trading Thursday on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Much of the volatility was the result of trade and commercial accounts seeking to profit from a perception of market weakness by a prominent trade and commercial account. Other trade and commercial players bid the cash market higher with the intent of forcing liquidation of underwater short positions. Today's activity is not seen as significant in the determination of longer term price trends, and short term traders see the market working higher. . .

Natural gas futures retreated in busy trading Thursday on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Much of the volatility was the result of trade and commercial accounts seeking to profit from a perception of market weakness by a prominent trade and commercial account. Other trade and commercial players bid the cash market higher with the intent of forcing liquidation of underwater short positions. Today's activity is not seen as significant in the determination of longer term price trends, and short term traders see the market working higher. . .

Mertz saw some decent deer today. Still hot out there  McComb had a shitty 24 hours. Scrambler out of gas wanted to blam on us. I  pointed out we used it for about hlaf an hour, only. then he got one flat  tire in his suburban. three feeders are down, one was booger which should have been repaired.  Looks like it should work, but it has fed three times since sept. Bone yard  not working. Hideout not working. Those may be battery issues. the other 7  stands are working and he filled them up.  his friends shot lots of doves at the trailer sun evening. Zander said his  bother shot a bunch a few weeks ago while picking stuff off their lease.  Chris said they were swarming around the trailer at sunset. Chris hunted  lone star brush pile sun evening, missed a spike and a turkey. saw a good  deer walking out.  he got another flat tire 13 miles away from llano at 9:30 pm. sherriff was  the only one he could get to help. a tow truck towed his truck back to  austin. he had his daughter with him. he got home at 1 am. he says his wife  may not let him go back.  doubtful keith will get out there next weekend to fix those feeders. we'll  have to fix them up on openning weekend.  e.  _________________________________________________________________ Get your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer.msn.com/intl.asp",brianc@saltgrass.com,joe.parks@enron.com,RE: Deer Lease Report,2001-10-31 08:36:11-08:00,sent

Chris, I can't believe you passed that deer up.  Very generous.  Chad shot a nice 10 point. Very impressive hunt. He hunted boneyard in the  morning, then hopped the fence into the robertson pasture and rattled the  deer withing 10 yards or so and managed to connect on a running shot as the  deer bolted away.  I fed my Python a gobbler at LoneStar. Then shot a solid schlocho at the  Hole sunday morning.  Pictures forthcoming.  Joe's beginner's honeymoon has come to an end. He saw nothing decent  everywhere he went.  Brian saw an impressive young 9 pt at booger. Jim videotaped it the next  morning. 21"" wide or so, short tines. Very tempting deer, but all agreed  that it was 4.5 and should go another year.  Dogs could not find Jim's deer. Dogs headed from last blood due south to  fence at highway.  Feeders are all in good shape, except Boneyard. It is running at 7 and 4:30.  But weak. Chris indicated it needed a bigger battery. We considered putting  a magnum on it, but if all it needs is a new battery, we'll leave it to you.  We should get it running well, lots of deer in that area. One good schlocho  and a bladed spike that needs to be shot. I put a new battery in Lonestar  and we filled it up. Booger topped off with motor run time increased. 30-30  was empty. We filled it up. Pig filled up an run time increased. We have  lots of corn, so if a feeder is not dropping lots of corn, turn up the spin  time and keep em full. Dropping extra corn also worked well at mesquite and  showtime.. Mertz will feed protien next week. I consulted with Chris and houston boys  openning weekend regarding mertz offer to let us buy extra protien this  fall, since he had met the quota. We agreed to see what he would feed but  cap it at $500, spread across the board.  Looks like Houston boys will be retruning December 15th weekend and closing  weekend. I'll be bringing Henry on next trip and think it would be great if  Keitha nd boys would be there too.  Hope Keith and Jim can make it back as soon as possible. We winterized  trailer on way out.

Chris, I can't believe you passed that deer up.  Very generous.  Chad shot a nice 10 point. Very impressive hunt. He hunted boneyard in the  morning, then hopped the fence into the robertson pasture and rattled the  deer withing 10 yards or so and managed to connect on a running shot as the  deer bolted away.  I fed my Python a gobbler at LoneStar. Then shot a solid schlocho at the  Hole sunday morning.  Pictures forthcoming.  Joe's beginner's honeymoon has come to an end. He saw nothing decent  everywhere he went.  Brian saw an impressive young 9 pt at booger. Jim videotaped it the next  morning. 21"" wide or so, short tines. Very tempting deer, but all agreed  that it was 4.5 and should go another year.  Dogs could not find Jim's deer. Dogs headed from last blood due south to  fence at highway.  Feeders are all in good shape, except Boneyard. It is running at 7 and 4:30.  But weak. Chris indicated it needed a bigger battery. We considered putting  a magnum on it, but if all it needs is a new battery, we'll leave it to you.  We should get it running well, lots of deer in that area. One good schlocho  and a bladed spike that needs to be shot. I put a new battery in Lonestar  and we filled it up. Booger topped off with motor run time increased. 30-30  was empty. We filled it up. Pig filled up an run time increased. We have  lots of corn, so if a feeder is not dropping lots of corn, turn up the spin  time and keep em full. Dropping extra corn also worked well at mesquite and  showtime.. Mertz will feed protien next week. I consulted with Chris and houston boys  openning weekend regarding mertz offer to let us buy extra protien this  fall, since he had met the quota. We agreed to see what he would feed but  cap it at $500, spread across the board.  Looks like Houston boys will be retruning December 15th weekend and closing  weekend. I'll be bringing Henry on next trip and think it would be great if  Keitha nd boys would be there too.  Hope Keith and Jim can make it back as soon as possible. We winterized  trailer on way out.

"Per our phone conversation.  Looks like Ed was copied yesterday also.  I will get with you after I have more information.   -----Original Message----- From:  Zisman, Stuart   Sent: Wednesday, January 02, 2002 4:38 PM To: McMichael Jr., Ed; Nemec, Gerald Cc: Redmond, Brian Subject: Bridgeline Partnership and Storage/Transportation Deals  Ed and Gerald,  Brian and I spoke with Randy Curry of Bridgeline earlier today regarding a deal that we are trying to put together in order to sell the pad gas (in place) from Storage Caverns #13/#14.  During that conversation, Randy indicated that: (i) ENA's default under its storage and transport agreements with Bridgeline impacts the Bridgeline partnership itself (and that there are certain side agreements that spell this out) and (ii) Bridgeline would reject any efforts by ENA to remove its gas inventories from storage facilities owned by Bridgeline.  Bridgeline contends that ENA is permitted to pay all past due amounts and provide adequate assurances for future payment on its storage and transport deals as there is a bankruptcy order in place that allows the debtors to pay common carrier liens and warehouseman's liens.  I asked Randy whether he had sought a lawyer's opinion regarding whether Bridgeline could be properly classified as a common carrier and/or warehouseman - he said that he had.  Gerald please advise regarding Randy's assertions above.  Ed, please let me know if you are already looking into either of these matters.  If not, my guess is that you will be interested in hearing more.

Recent energy investment sentiment could be characterized as a fear-driven, cautious psychology that has led to a generally under-owned condition for most energy stocks.  A major contributor to this negative psychology has been the underlying belief of investors that ""energy stocks always bottom several times before a sustained upward move.""  While that was true in the 1998/1999 downturn, we are convinced that today's energy fundamentals are far different than those experienced in the downturn several years ago.  In fact, we believe today's environment is much more similar to that experienced in the 1972/1974 timeframe, when energy stocks experienced a two-year run-up followed by a recession and subsequent nine month sell off. In the 1974 downturn, however, the stocks experienced one bottom in the late fall and never looked back.  Likewise, we are convinced that energy stocks have already seen their lowest levels and as strong commodity fundamentals become visible later in the first quarter, the stocks will begin to run.  In other words, we believe the energy stocks are near the bottom of a cyclical downturn within what we believe is going to be a longer-term secular upswing.

"   -----Original Message----- From:  Meyer, Chris   Sent: Friday, January 18, 2002 3:40 PM To: Zisman, Stuart Cc: Parks, Joe; Nemec, Gerald Subject: Bridgeline Working Gas  Spoke with Joe Parks this p.m.  Bridgeline will require gas retention to cover December and January storage and transport fees (approx. $1.32 million).  Assuming a $2.35 fixed price for the gas, we should be able to liquidate a little better than 1 Bcf.  It will take (at most) 9 days to withdrawal given our firm withdrawal rights of 150,000 MMBtu/d.  The storage contract has interruptible withdrawal rights above this, but any withdrawals above 150,000 MMBtu will be on a best efforts basis.  Our highest net back will probably be Henry Hub; however, ENA's Transport Agreement only allows 55,000 firm delivery rights to HH...everything else will be on a secondary basis, which carries a lower priority of service in the event the pipeline restricts flows to HH.   Joe mentioned that Bridgeline may be willing to purchase the gas in ground.  Once we get the go ahead to sell, it will be a matter of  determining the best price to ENA.  The transport and storage does not appear to carry any incremental charges to move it across the Bridgeline system, since we will be reserving gas for January transport fees.  Therefore, we will look to the highest offer on the system.  Joe reminded me of a Bridgeline issue you addressed in an earlier e-mail which stated ""he wants ENA to execute a document which makes it clear that by releasing the gas, Bridgeline is not waiving any rights that it might have to a warehouseman's lien on the gas in storage.  He is having their lawyer send a draft of this document to Gerald.""    Questions: 1. Do you know where Gerald sits in relation to this matter? 2. Do we have to go to the BMC / Cash Committee, etc...to transact?  Let me know.  cmm   ",troy.denetsosie@enron.com,joe.parks@enron.com,FW: Bridgeline Working Gas,2002-01-22 06:59:18-08:00,sent
"Joe - per our discussion on Friday, any assistance you can give Mark and I in selling February TW (West Tx Pool) gas would be appreciated. We can sell more term if need be.  I will forward you, under separate email, the details.  Mark will provide the exact volume prior to the end of day.  I've already talked to Allegany Supply Development and Cook Inlet.  Neither has shown much interest.  Mark sold January's balance to Sid Richardson.

As part of a compression service deal on Transwestern, Enron Compressions Service (a non-bankrupt Enron entity) is long approximately 12,000 /d of physical gas at the West Texas Pool beginning Feb 02.  ECS receives these molecules directly from TW. In turn, ECS converts the gas to cash in order to pay a portion of the electric bill required to run the electric driven compression.  With the bankruptcy of ENA, ECS is  looking for another counter party to monazite the gas.  The contract has a small swing component which is fixed (each month) during bid week.  The specifics are as follows:   Contract #1: Base 7,892 mmbtu/d through December 31, 2006       Swing (up only) of 1,120 mmbtu/d through December 31, 2006   Contract #2 Base 3,462 mmbtu/d through May 31, 2010    Swing (up only) of 595 mmbtu/d through July 31, 2010  Again TW delivers all molecules to the West Texas Pool.  We are willing to consider a term of any length, but strongly prefer to sell the term.

OILSERVICE        2) Newpark (NYSE: NR) Confirms Earnings Guidance       *     NR indicated that it expects to report earnings of approximately $0.05 per share for the fourth quarter when it reports its results on Feb. 26th. This pre-release is basically in-line with the consensus estimate of $0.06 per share.       *      NR also confirmed that it is comfortable with the consensus estimates for fiscal 2002, which are currently around $0.30 per share.       *      Additionally, NR announced they have received a final commitment for the renewal of their $100 million bank credit facility provided by a bank syndicate led by Bank One.  The facility will be expiring in early 2005 on terms in line with the current agreement (2% over LIBOR). Borrowings under the credit facility were below $40 million at year-end compared to $83 million a year earlier.       *      NR will announce earnings after the close on February 26th and host a conference call at 10am (EST) on February 27th.        3) BJ Clean Up In the First Quarter       *     BJ Services (NYSE:BJS/$25.81/Strong Buy) reported fiscal first quarter earnings of $0.42 per share (excluding goodwill amortization), compared with $0.38 per share last year.  This result was a penny above the consensus estimate and $0.03 per share above our estimate.       *     Revenues for the quarter came in at $510.1 million, down 17% sequentially and up 4% over the prior year.  Operating margins of 20.6% were down roughly 4,500 basis points from the prior quarter and roughly flat from a year ago.       *     A 20% sequential decline in U.S. revenues is impressive, given the 19% decline in the U.S. rig count, combined with a 5% deterioration in pricing.  Additionally, international revenues were down only 12%, no thanks to the slow start to the winter season in Canada.       *     Looking forward, the recent start-up of a new stimulation vessel, combined with seasonally improved Canadian activity and flat to up international activity, should help to partially offset the near-term expected weakness in the U.S.  Likewise, continued growth in the coiled tubing business should drive further improvements in 2002.       *     Furthermore, BJ's share repurchase program continues to add accretion to our estimates.  This factor, combined with the implementation of FASB 142 (no amortization of goodwill), is now included in our estimates.       *     Following the quarterly report, and factoring in the aforementioned issues, we are shaving a nickel off of our FY2002 estimate, which goes from $1.35 to $1.30 per share.  This falls toward the low end of the company's revised guidance range of $1.25 to $1.40 per share. Additionally, we are raising our FY2003 EPS estimate from $1.95 to $2.00, mainly to reflect the lack of goodwill amortization.  We are reiterating our Strong Buy rating and 12-month target price of $37.00 per share (based on a blended average of valuation techniques applied to our 2003 estimates).        4) Trico's (NASDAQ:TMAR/$5.97/Strong Buy) Business Remains ""Afloat""       *     In-line with nearly all levels of oilfield activity, the supply boat business has clearly deteriorated from where it was just six months ago.  That being said, it has not fallen apart nearly as rapidly or to the magnitude we originally thought. *     Industry consolidation, better balance sheets and price rationality has buoyed supply boat dayrates in the Gulf of Mexico much better than we have ever witnessed in the past. *     This, combined with what appears to be a solid North Sea market is likely to cause our earnings forecast for Trico to be overly conservative. Furthermore, at today's price, TMAR is trading for well below asset and book value. *     With an improving overall outlook for oilfield service stocks on the horizon, TMAR appears to present a great opportunity for investors over the long haul.

I spoke to Bryce Baxter, Manager of Settlements as to what could be done to get El Paso their funds. He stated that as a result of the Bankruptcy, Bank of America where the wire transfer was sent, seized the account and has frozen those funds. Bryce also stated that they did not intend to return the funds since they were originally for AEP and AEP owned $ 25M on November 26 and and another $ 45M on December 26.

It is not unreasonable for them to specify the grounds under which they are holding our gas.  They are in violation of the automatic stay is they do not return our gas and I will point this out to their attorney.   -----Original Message----- From:  Meyer, Chris   Sent: Thursday, February 07, 2002 11:29 AM To: Zisman, Stuart; Nemec, Gerald Cc: Parks, Joe Subject: Centana - Colorable Warehouseman's Lien  Talked to Joe....The counter party has only provided a verbal as to its claim against the gas in ground...nothing written.  Their comments have ranged from ""if you don't pay me for past amounts, we are not going to buy any gas from you"" to ""we are holding the gas till you pay us""  Based on Joe's discussions to date, the proposition of having Centana provide a written claim to stored gas appears small.  Our most probable options appear to be:   (1) pay pre petition amounts under the 1st day order based on an implied / colorable warehouseman's lien        (post petition amounts are already approved);  (2) request a written assertion of Centana's rights and proceed under 1st day order;  (3) forget 1 and 2 above and go through the TRC, BMC and CC;  (4) Force the issue w/Centana and sell gas in ground to a third party, if available.  My preference is option (1) as :  - option (2) is the most unlikely,   - option (3) is cumbersome and we are subject to price risk while we continue to accrue storage costs, and  - option (4) holds significant transaction risk.  Regardless of the above, I assume we still need to complete the Batch Funding Request (""BFR"").  Joe - have you finished the valuation and recommendation portions of the BFR?  Gerald -  if Centana will not provide a written response, can we proceed with (1) above?   chris x31666    ",joe.parks@enron.com,chris.meyer@enron.com,FW: Centana - Colorable Warehouseman's Lien,2002-02-07 14:20:38-08:00,received

However, what is not clear from the below is ....essentially, Centana will have to asert a claim against the molecules in the ground (for pre and post petition amounts), if we are going to pay on those claims.     cmm    [Meyer, Chris]   -----Original Message----- From: Zisman, Stuart  Sent: Friday, February 8, 2002 12:55 PM To: Nemec, Gerald; Meyer, Chris Cc: Parks, Joe Subject: RE: Centana - Colorable Warehouseman's Lien   Gerald,    If you haven't heard from Joe on this, please get in touch with him.     Joe - this is a reasonable request given that we need to understand why they feel that they are entitled to hold the gas.  We are not trying to be argumentative but need to understand (and have them articulate a rationale for) why they feel that they can do this.  Once we hear where they are coming from, I think we will be able to get to where everyone wants to go (i.e. settlement and sale of the gas).

It is not unreasonable for them to specify the grounds under which they are holding our gas.  They are in violation of the automatic stay is they do not return our gas and I will point this out to their attorney.   -----Original Message-----  From:   Meyer, Chris   Sent:   Thursday, February 07, 2002 11:29 AM  To:     Zisman, Stuart; Nemec, Gerald  Cc:     Parks, Joe  Subject:        Centana - Colorable Warehouseman's Lien   Talked to Joe....The counter party has only provided a verbal as to its claim against the gas in ground...nothing written.  Their comments have ranged from ""if you don't pay me for past amounts, we are not going to buy any gas from you"" to ""we are holding the gas till you pay us""  Based on Joe's discussions to date, the proposition of having Centana provide a written claim to stored gas appears small.  Our most probable options appear to be:    (1) pay pre petition amounts under the 1st day order based on an implied / colorable warehouseman's lien         (post petition amounts are already approved);   (2) request a written assertion of Centana's rights and proceed under 1st day order;   (3) forget 1 and 2 above and go through the TRC, BMC and CC;   (4) Force the issue w/Centana and sell gas in ground to a third party, if available.   My preference is option (1) as :          -       option (2) is the most unlikely,          -       option (3) is cumbersome and we are subject to price risk while we continue to accrue storage costs, and          -       option (4) holds significant transaction risk.   Regardless of the above, I assume we still need to complete the Batch Funding Request (""BFR"").   Joe - have you finished the valuation and recommendation portions of the BFR?   Gerald -  if Centana will not provide a written response, can we proceed with (1) above?   chris  x31666     ",joe.parks@enron.com,chris.meyer@enron.com,FW: Centana - Colorable Warehouseman's Lien,2002-02-08 12:32:30-08:00,received

This differs a bit from the deal that was originally discussed but seems to make sense.  Please disregard the second attachment at it relates to a modification of the Storage Agreement that has not been discussed (and one that we are not willing to make).  Also, the letter as drafted does not contemplate (but we will insist on) placement of the proceeds from the sale of gas associated with pre-petition amounts into escrow with some third party until some resolution is reached on those amounts.  By way of example, if Centana is owed $100k pre-petition, $150k post-petition and has $1,000,000 worth of gas in the ground, Centana would remit (i) $100k to an escrow agent for subsequent resolution and disposition and (ii) $750k to ENA ($900k offset by the $150k for post petition obligations).  The key issue is what level of approval is needed to do this.  A strong case could be made for Cash Committee only because no pre-petition amounts are being paid (and no resolution of those amounts is being reached).  Rather, we are just converting the commodity to cash when the market is higher than it has been over the past several weeks.  Another good reason for doing this is that after the cavern is empty, we can argue that we are not using it and therefore no more post-petition obligations continue to accrue following the consummation of the deal (while we decide to accept or reject).

The following is his response to Centana's counsel email.  I did discuss with Mark this morning, the current course we are following with Centana and he agreed it made sense.  As it stands now we would sell all the gas in-place to Centana and they would net out post-petition fees.  Our business people feel that we have used the storage services post-petition and consequently those fees would be an administrative expense.  An amount equivalent to the pre-petition fees would be held in escrow until the bankrutpcy court resolved the pre-petition amounts.

Total storage is now 1,944 Bcf, which is 960 above last year.       This week's report showed 4-5 Bcf/d less gas available for storage       relative to last year on a weather-adjusted basis.       The near-month (March) futures contract showed some strength this       week, after the National Weather Service (NWS) forecasted       colder-than-normal weather in several key consuming regions during       the next 2 weeks.  Additionally, short covering by traders probably       added to the positive momentum.  The contract traded as high as       $2.46/MMBtu this week, before slipping to $2.40/MMBtu after the AGA's       report.       To reach 1,500 Bcf of gas in storage by the end of the traditional       withdrawal season, approximately 74 Bcf/week would have to be pulled       from storage on average over the last six weeks.  This compares to       approximately 56 Bcf/week withdrawn during the same period last year       under normal temperatures.  As a result, of the NWS's forecast is       accurate, we could still hit the 1,500 Bcf mark.  However, if weather       remains 15-20% warmer than normal, the probability of withdrawing       that much gas decreases substantially.       Longer-term, we continue to believe that natural gas fundamentals       will be a supply driven equation.  Based on fourth quarter production       volumes reported so far, it appears that U.S. natural gas production       will, in fact, show both sequential and year-to-year declines.       Despite the potential for near-term weakness in prices, we remain       bullish on the intermediate and longer-term fundamentals for natural       gas.      2) The American Petroleum Institute (API) reported that total petroleum    inventories decreased 5.5 MMBbls to 673.6 MMBbls for the week ended    February 15, 2002.     ?       The consensus range called for a 0.7 MMBbl build to a 2.4 MMBbl    build.  This is a bullish report for the oil market.  Total petroleum    inventories are currently 73.5 MMBbls (~12%) above levels one year ago.     ?       Crude oil inventories decreased 4.5 MMBbls to 316.2 MMBbls last    week.  Crude oil inventories are 37.5 MMBbls above last year at this    time.  Based on our current U.S. crude oil demand estimate, there are    approximately 17 days of crude oil inventory.       Motor gasoline inventories increased 0.6 MMBbl to 218.2 MMBbls last       week.  Motor gasoline inventories are 13.0 MMBbls above last year at       this time.     ?       Distillate fuel inventories decreased 1.6 MMBbls to 139.2 MMBbls    last week.  Distillate inventories are 23.0 MMBbls above last year at    this time.     ?       U.S. refinery operations were at a 88.5% utilization rate, which    was 0.7% higher than last week's 87.8% rate.  Total Petroleum imports    decreased to 10.4 MMBbls/day.       Despite last week's larger than anticipated draw in total petroleum       inventories, the slowdown in U.S. economic growth that was       exacerbated by the September 11 terrorist attacks has continued to       weigh on demand and contribute to inventory levels that remain well       above our 5-year average.      OILSERVICE     3) BJ Services Announces Another Strategic Acquisition.    ?       Yesterday, BJ Services (NYSE:BJS/$30.03/Strong Buy) announced    that it has signed a definitive merger agreement with OSCA, Inc.    (NASDAQ:OSCA/$27.65) for $28 per share (a 27% premium to the    pre-announcement stock price).  This all-cash deal equates to a total    purchase price of roughly $420 million and is expected to close by the    end of the second calendar quarter.     ?       OSCA provides a full array of completion-related products and    services, including completion fluids, completion tools and completion    services.  BJ should ultimately be able to leverage the incremental    products, services and markets across its existing asset and customer    base to yield significant pull-through revenue opportunities down the    road.  While it appears that BJ paid a full price for OSCA, the    combination makes a lot of strategic sense.     ?       Following the announced acquisition, we are making slight    modifications to our near-term estimates.  Specifically, we are shaving    a nickel from our existing FY2002 estimate, bringing it down to $1.25    per share.  This is primarily due to the closing of the acquisition    without significant near-term cost savings or pull through benefits.  As    management indicated on its conference call, it expects the deal to be    accretive to the FY2003 consensus of $1.85 per share by $0.06 to $0.07    per share.  Since we are already in print at $2.00, we are leaving our    FY2003 estimates unchanged in order to be conservative.  Given the    expected slight accretion to FY2003 earnings, combined with potential    longer-term upside and an improving market outlook, we are maintaining    our Strong Buy rating and 12-month target price of $37 per share.     4) Tetra Technologies beats consensus by a penny and appears extremely    undervalued relative to its peers!       Following yesterday's acquisition of OSCA by BJ Services, it is even       more clear now that Tetra Technologies (NYSE:TTI/$23.62/Strong Buy)       is cheap.       Specifically, OSCA was purchased for between 30-35x 2003 EPS, or       12-14x 2003 EBITDA.       If we apply those multiples to TTI, we come up with a value of $45 to       $55 per share, as opposed to the current price of $23.62 per share.       The TTI story is very similar to that of OSCA, only perhaps not as       well known.       Following OSCA's acquisition, there remains a chance that TTI could       be taken out at some point in time (although we have no reason to       believe it will be soon).       Furthermore, TTI stands a chance of gaining business as a result of       this transaction.       Finally, the company reported fourth quarter EPS of $0.35 per share,       a penny above consensus.  It will host a conference call today at       10:30am ET.  The dial in number is 800-860-2442.     5) Unit Corp. handily beats fourth quarter earnings expectations    ?       Unit Corp. (NYSE:UNT/$12.60/Strong Buy) reported fourth quarter    earnings of $0.27 per share, compared to $0.43 per share in the fourth    quarter of 2000.  This result was $0.04 ahead of the consensus estimate    of $0.23 per share.     ?       Revenues for the quarter came in at $49.3 million, down    approximately 25% from last year and down 28% from the third quarter.    Likewise, overall operating margins were down over 530 basis points    year-to-year to about 50%, while they were also down a like amount on a    sequential basis.     ?       The strong quarterly results were largely a result of    stronger-than-expected dayrates, utilization and margins during the    quarter.  In fact, average dayrates were down by only about $800 to just    under $10,200 per day.  Meanwhile, average realized oil and natural gas    prices reflected the current softer commodity price environment with    declines on a year-to-year basis of 41% for oil and 61% for gas.    Production volumes also decreased from last year by 2% for oil and 15%    for natural gas.     ?       Despite the generally strong results, drilling activity has    fallen dramatically over the past couple months.  This drop in overall    rig activity has had a significant impact on Unit's utilization,    dropping from a quarterly average of nearly 71% rigs in Q4 to the    current run-rate of 60%, pulling dayrates down another 10-15% currently.     ?       Due to declines in the near-term outlook for drilling and    production, combined with Unit's current activity indicators (dayrates,    utilization, production and commodity prices), we are adjusting our    quarterly estimates but keeping our annual estimates.  Accordingly, we    are maintaining our 2002 estimate of $0.80 per share and our 2003    estimate of $1.40 per share.  Despite the lack of near-term visibility,    the improving long-term outlook causes us to maintain our Strong Buy    rating with a 12-month target price of $18 per share (based on a blended    average of three valuation techniques).     6) Conrad Reports Very Disappointing Quarterly Loss       Conrad Industries (NASDAQ:CNRD/$4.10/Strong Buy) reported its fourth       quarter of a loss of $0.02 per share, compared to a profit of $0.10       per share in the fourth quarter of 2000.  This results missed the       consensus estimate by $0.14 per share.       Revenues for the quarter came in at $9.9 million, which was down 11%       from this same quarter last year and down 23% from last quarter.  The       gross margin for the quarter was 13.8%, which was down over 800 basis       points from the year ago period and down almost 800 basis points       sequentially.       The backlog at quarter-end stood at $10.4 million, down 49% from the       fourth quarter of 2000 but up 4% from last quarter.       The Company blamed the poor quarterly performance on weakness in the       economy and offshore oil and gas industry.       The Company will host a conference call at 10:30am ET this morning.       You may access the call by dialing 800-966-6502.  A replay will be       available by dialing 800-677-6200 and using access code 2280.     E&P     7) AEC Beats 4Q Expectations, EnCana Merger On Track       AEC (NYSE:AOG/Strong Buy) reported fourth quarter 2001 EPS of C$0.55       per share, which was ahead of our estimate of C$0.40 per share.       AEC achieved record sales averaging 356,000 Boe/d, up 20% from 2000.       Each of the three growth platforms - Canada, the U.S. Rockies and       Ecuador - set new records.       In 2001, AEC's established conventional reserves rose by 15% to       nearly 6 Tcf of gas and more than 600 million Bbls of oil and natural       gas liquids. The Company replaced 276% of 2001 conventional sales,       with 89% of the reserve additions coming through the drill bit. The       largest reserve additions were in the U.S. Rockies and northeast       British Columbia.       The merger with PanCanadian remains on track with shareholder's       meetings scheduled for early April and closing expected shortly       thereafter.       Alberta Energy's merger with PanCanadian Energy to form EnCana will       create the largest and fastest growing super independent producer in       the industry with a C$27 billion enterprise value and visible       production growth in excess of 14% annually for at least the next       five years. The combined company will have a dominant position in       North America with interests in western Canada, the U.S. Rockies,       offshore Eastern Canada and the Gulf of Mexico, as well as 23 million       undeveloped acres along the Rocky Mountain Fairway from southern       Colorado to Alaska.  EnCana will also have large international growth       engines in Ecuador and the North Sea.       Our target price of C$80 (US$52) is based on a 6.1x multiple of 2002       cash flow, a valuation comparable to that of its super independent       peers.  We reiterate our Strong Buy rating.     8) Pure Posts Stronger Than Expected 4Q Results, Reduces Capital Budget    for '02.       Pure Resources (NYSE:PRS/$19.90/Strong Buy) reported 4Q:01 EPS of       $0.00 per share, which was significantly higher than our estimate of       a loss of ($0.17) and the consensus estimate of ($0.13).       PRS's production during 4Q:01 totaled 390 Mmcfe/d, up 70% from the       same period last year, including acquisitions made during 2001,  and       up 85% for the full year.  However, the company lowered 2002 volume       guidance from 12% growth to 9% growth based on a reduced capital       spending program.  As a result, we have lowered our 2002 earnings       estimate from $0.32 to $0.31 per share to reflect the reduced       expectations.       Additionally, we are initiating 2003 EPS and CFPS estimates of $1.12       and $6.30, respectively, based on 11% production growth from 2002 to       2003 and average commodity prices of $3.75/Mcf of gas and $26.00/Bbl       of oil.       The Company replaced 385% of its production from all sources at a       cost of $1.82/Mcfe, and increased its total reserves by 34% to 1,469       Bcfe.       We are maintaining our Strong Buy rating on shares of Pure.  Through       experience, operational focus and the application of newer       technology, Pure has the opportunity to create significant value in       the ""mature"" Permian Basin.  Our target price of $24 is based on a       5.3x multiple of 2002 cash flow, a valuation justified by the       Company's geographical focus and operating leverage in the Permian       Basin.     9) XTO 4Q Results In-Line With Expectations.    ?       XTO Energy (NYSE:XTO/$17.10/Strong Buy) reported 4Q:01 EPS of    $0.42, which was in-line with our estimate of $0.41 and consensus of    $0.40.     ?       XTO's production during 4Q:01 totaled 565 Mmcfe/d, up 20% from    the same period last year and up 17% for the full year.     ?       Additionally, we are initiating 2003 EPS and CFPS estimates of    $2.19 and $5.27, respectively, based on 12% production growth from 2002    to 2003 and average commodity prices of $3.75/Mcf of gas and $26.00/Bbl    of oil.     ?       During the conference call, XTO mentioned that it may make an    acquisition in lieu of a portion of its organic production growth    through the drillbit.  More specifically, XTO may forego a portion of    its East Texas drilling budget and use $100-150 million towards an    acquisition.  Either way, XTO is expected to achieve its 17-20%    production growth target.     ?       XTO has a multi-year inventory of development opportunities in    the low-F&D cost Arkoma and San Juan Basins, as well as the East Texas    Freestone and Bossier Trends.  For an E&P company, XTO has a    large/diverse asset base, substantial project inventory, and multiple    productive zones in its core producing areas.  We are maintaining our    Strong Buy rating on shares of XTO based on the company's ability to    generate consistent double-digit production growth.  Our target price of    $24 is based on a 6.5x multiple of 2002 cash flow, a valuation justified    by the company's consistent and visible growth.

Total storage is now 1,944 Bcf, which is 960 above last year.       This week's report showed 4-5 Bcf/d less gas available for storage       relative to last year on a weather-adjusted basis.       The near-month (March) futures contract showed some strength this       week, after the National Weather Service (NWS) forecasted       colder-than-normal weather in several key consuming regions during       the next 2 weeks.? Additionally, short covering by traders probably       added to the positive momentum.? The contract traded as high as       $2.46/MMBtu this week, before slipping to $2.40/MMBtu after the AGA's       report.       To reach 1,500 Bcf of gas in storage by the end of the traditional       withdrawal season, approximately 74 Bcf/week would have to be pulled       from storage on average over the last six weeks.? This compares to       approximately 56 Bcf/week withdrawn during the same period last year       under normal temperatures.? As a result, of the NWS's forecast is       accurate, we could still hit the 1,500 Bcf mark.? However, if weather       remains 15-20% warmer than normal, the probability of withdrawing       that much gas decreases substantially.       Longer-term, we continue to believe that natural gas fundamentals       will be a supply driven equation.? Based on fourth quarter production       volumes reported so far, it appears that U.S. natural gas production       will, in fact, show both sequential and year-to-year declines.       Despite the potential for near-term weakness in prices, we remain       bullish on the intermediate and longer-term fundamentals for natural       gas.      2) The American Petroleum Institute (API) reported that total petroleum    inventories decreased 5.5 MMBbls to 673.6 MMBbls for the week ended    February 15, 2002.     ??????? The consensus range called for a 0.7 MMBbl build to a 2.4 MMBbl    build.? This is a bullish report for the oil market.? Total petroleum    inventories are currently 73.5 MMBbls (~12%) above levels one year ago.     ??????? Crude oil inventories decreased 4.5 MMBbls to 316.2 MMBbls last    week.? Crude oil inventories are 37.5 MMBbls above last year at this    time.? Based on our current U.S. crude oil demand estimate, there are    approximately 17 days of crude oil inventory.       Motor gasoline inventories increased 0.6 MMBbl to 218.2 MMBbls last       week.? Motor gasoline inventories are 13.0 MMBbls above last year at       this time.     ??????? Distillate fuel inventories decreased 1.6 MMBbls to 139.2 MMBbls    last week.? Distillate inventories are 23.0 MMBbls above last year at    this time.     ??????? U.S. refinery operations were at a 88.5% utilization rate, which    was 0.7% higher than last week's 87.8% rate.? Total Petroleum imports    decreased to 10.4 MMBbls/day.       Despite last week's larger than anticipated draw in total petroleum       inventories, the slowdown in U.S. economic growth that was       exacerbated by the September 11 terrorist attacks has continued to       weigh on demand and contribute to inventory levels that remain well       above our 5-year average.      OILSERVICE     3) BJ Services Announces Another Strategic Acquisition.    ??????? Yesterday, BJ Services (NYSE:BJS/$30.03/Strong Buy) announced    that it has signed a definitive merger agreement with OSCA, Inc.    (NASDAQ:OSCA/$27.65) for $28 per share (a 27% premium to the    pre-announcement stock price).? This all-cash deal equates to a total    purchase price of roughly $420 million and is expected to close by the    end of the second calendar quarter.     ??????? OSCA provides a full array of completion-related products and    services, including completion fluids, completion tools and completion    services.? BJ should ultimately be able to leverage the incremental    products, services and markets across its existing asset and customer    base to yield significant pull-through revenue opportunities down the    road.? While it appears that BJ paid a full price for OSCA, the    combination makes a lot of strategic sense.     ??????? Following the announced acquisition, we are making slight    modifications to our near-term estimates.? Specifically, we are shaving    a nickel from our existing FY2002 estimate, bringing it down to $1.25    per share.? This is primarily due to the closing of the acquisition    without significant near-term cost savings or pull through benefits.? As    management indicated on its conference call, it expects the deal to be    accretive to the FY2003 consensus of $1.85 per share by $0.06 to $0.07    per share.? Since we are already in print at $2.00, we are leaving our    FY2003 estimates unchanged in order to be conservative.? Given the    expected slight accretion to FY2003 earnings, combined with potential    longer-term upside and an improving market outlook, we are maintaining    our Strong Buy rating and 12-month target price of $37 per share.     4) Tetra Technologies beats consensus by a penny and appears extremely    undervalued relative to its peers!       Following yesterday's acquisition of OSCA by BJ Services, it is even       more clear now that Tetra Technologies (NYSE:TTI/$23.62/Strong Buy)       is cheap.       Specifically, OSCA was purchased for between 30-35x 2003 EPS, or       12-14x 2003 EBITDA.       If we apply those multiples to TTI, we come up with a value of $45 to       $55 per share, as opposed to the current price of $23.62 per share.       The TTI story is very similar to that of OSCA, only perhaps not as       well known.       Following OSCA's acquisition, there remains a chance that TTI could       be taken out at some point in time (although we have no reason to       believe it will be soon).       Furthermore, TTI stands a chance of gaining business as a result of       this transaction.       Finally, the company reported fourth quarter EPS of $0.35 per share,       a penny above consensus.? It will host a conference call today at       10:30am ET.? The dial in number is 800-860-2442.     5) Unit Corp. handily beats fourth quarter earnings expectations    ??????? Unit Corp. (NYSE:UNT/$12.60/Strong Buy) reported fourth quarter    earnings of $0.27 per share, compared to $0.43 per share in the fourth    quarter of 2000.? This result was $0.04 ahead of the consensus estimate    of $0.23 per share.     ??????? Revenues for the quarter came in at $49.3 million, down    approximately 25% from last year and down 28% from the third quarter.    Likewise, overall operating margins were down over 530 basis points    year-to-year to about 50%, while they were also down a like amount on a    sequential basis.     ??????? The strong quarterly results were largely a result of    stronger-than-expected dayrates, utilization and margins during the    quarter.? In fact, average dayrates were down by only about $800 to just    under $10,200 per day.? Meanwhile, average realized oil and natural gas    prices reflected the current softer commodity price environment with    declines on a year-to-year basis of 41% for oil and 61% for gas.    Production volumes also decreased from last year by 2% for oil and 15%    for natural gas.     ??????? Despite the generally strong results, drilling activity has    fallen dramatically over the past couple months.? This drop in overall    rig activity has had a significant impact on Unit's utilization,    dropping from a quarterly average of nearly 71% rigs in Q4 to the    current run-rate of 60%, pulling dayrates down another 10-15% currently.     ??????? Due to declines in the near-term outlook for drilling and    production, combined with Unit's current activity indicators (dayrates,    utilization, production and commodity prices), we are adjusting our    quarterly estimates but keeping our annual estimates.? Accordingly, we    are maintaining our 2002 estimate of $0.80 per share and our 2003    estimate of $1.40 per share.? Despite the lack of near-term visibility,    the improving long-term outlook causes us to maintain our Strong Buy    rating with a 12-month target price of $18 per share (based on a blended    average of three valuation techniques).     6) Conrad Reports Very Disappointing Quarterly Loss       Conrad Industries (NASDAQ:CNRD/$4.10/Strong Buy) reported its fourth       quarter of a loss of $0.02 per share, compared to a profit of $0.10       per share in the fourth quarter of 2000.? This results missed the       consensus estimate by $0.14 per share.       Revenues for the quarter came in at $9.9 million, which was down 11%       from this same quarter last year and down 23% from last quarter.? The       gross margin for the quarter was 13.8%, which was down over 800 basis       points from the year ago period and down almost 800 basis points       sequentially.       The backlog at quarter-end stood at $10.4 million, down 49% from the       fourth quarter of 2000 but up 4% from last quarter.       The Company blamed the poor quarterly performance on weakness in the       economy and offshore oil and gas industry.       The Company will host a conference call at 10:30am ET this morning.       You may access the call by dialing 800-966-6502.? A replay will be       available by dialing 800-677-6200 and using access code 2280.     E&P     7) AEC Beats 4Q Expectations, EnCana Merger On Track       AEC (NYSE:AOG/Strong Buy) reported fourth quarter 2001 EPS of C$0.55       per share, which was ahead of our estimate of C$0.40 per share.       AEC achieved record sales averaging 356,000 Boe/d, up 20% from 2000.       Each of the three growth platforms - Canada, the U.S. Rockies and       Ecuador - set new records.       In 2001, AEC's established conventional reserves rose by 15% to       nearly 6 Tcf of gas and more than 600 million Bbls of oil and natural       gas liquids. The Company replaced 276% of 2001 conventional sales,       with 89% of the reserve additions coming through the drill bit. The       largest reserve additions were in the U.S. Rockies and northeast       British Columbia.       The merger with PanCanadian remains on track with shareholder's       meetings scheduled for early April and closing expected shortly       thereafter.       Alberta Energy's merger with PanCanadian Energy to form EnCana will       create the largest and fastest growing super independent producer in       the industry with a C$27 billion enterprise value and visible       production growth in excess of 14% annually for at least the next       five years. The combined company will have a dominant position in       North America with interests in western Canada, the U.S. Rockies,       offshore Eastern Canada and the Gulf of Mexico, as well as 23 million       undeveloped acres along the Rocky Mountain Fairway from southern       Colorado to Alaska.? EnCana will also have large international growth       engines in Ecuador and the North Sea.       Our target price of C$80 (US$52) is based on a 6.1x multiple of 2002       cash flow, a valuation comparable to that of its super independent       peers.? We reiterate our Strong Buy rating.     8) Pure Posts Stronger Than Expected 4Q Results, Reduces Capital Budget    for '02.       Pure Resources (NYSE:PRS/$19.90/Strong Buy) reported 4Q:01 EPS of       $0.00 per share, which was significantly higher than our estimate of       a loss of ($0.17) and the consensus estimate of ($0.13).       PRS's production during 4Q:01 totaled 390 Mmcfe/d, up 70% from the       same period last year, including acquisitions made during 2001,? and       up 85% for the full year.? However, the company lowered 2002 volume       guidance from 12% growth to 9% growth based on a reduced capital       spending program.? As a result, we have lowered our 2002 earnings       estimate from $0.32 to $0.31 per share to reflect the reduced       expectations.       Additionally, we are initiating 2003 EPS and CFPS estimates of $1.12       and $6.30, respectively, based on 11% production growth from 2002 to       2003 and average commodity prices of $3.75/Mcf of gas and $26.00/Bbl       of oil.       The Company replaced 385% of its production from all sources at a       cost of $1.82/Mcfe, and increased its total reserves by 34% to 1,469       Bcfe.       We are maintaining our Strong Buy rating on shares of Pure.? Through       experience, operational focus and the application of newer       technology, Pure has the opportunity to create significant value in       the ""mature"" Permian Basin.? Our target price of $24 is based on a       5.3x multiple of 2002 cash flow, a valuation justified by the       Company's geographical focus and operating leverage in the Permian       Basin.     9) XTO 4Q Results In-Line With Expectations.    ??????? XTO Energy (NYSE:XTO/$17.10/Strong Buy) reported 4Q:01 EPS of    $0.42, which was in-line with our estimate of $0.41 and consensus of    $0.40.     ??????? XTO's production during 4Q:01 totaled 565 Mmcfe/d, up 20% from    the same period last year and up 17% for the full year.     ??????? Additionally, we are initiating 2003 EPS and CFPS estimates of    $2.19 and $5.27, respectively, based on 12% production growth from 2002    to 2003 and average commodity prices of $3.75/Mcf of gas and $26.00/Bbl    of oil.     ??????? During the conference call, XTO mentioned that it may make an    acquisition in lieu of a portion of its organic production growth    through the drillbit.? More specifically, XTO may forego a portion of    its East Texas drilling budget and use $100-150 million towards an    acquisition.? Either way, XTO is expected to achieve its 17-20%    production growth target.     ??????? XTO has a multi-year inventory of development opportunities in    the low-F&D cost Arkoma and San Juan Basins, as well as the East Texas    Freestone and Bossier Trends.? For an E&P company, XTO has a    large/diverse asset base, substantial project inventory, and multiple    productive zones in its core producing areas.? We are maintaining our    Strong Buy rating on shares of XTO based on the company's ability to    generate consistent double-digit production growth.? Our target price of    $24 is based on a 6.5x multiple of 2002 cash flow, a valuation justified    by the company's consistent and visible growth.

Total storage is now 1,944 Bcf, which is 960 above last year.       This week's report showed 4-5 Bcf/d less gas available for storage       relative to last year on a weather-adjusted basis.       The near-month (March) futures contract showed some strength this       week, after the National Weather Service (NWS) forecasted       colder-than-normal weather in several key consuming regions during       the next 2 weeks.

The contract traded as high as       $2.46/MMBtu this week, before slipping to $2.40/MMBtu after the AGA's       report.       To reach 1,500 Bcf of gas in storage by the end of the traditional       withdrawal season, approximately 74 Bcf/week would have to be pulled       from storage on average over the last six weeks.  This compares to       approximately 56 Bcf/week withdrawn during the same period last year       under normal temperatures.  As a result, of the NWS's forecast is       accurate, we could still hit the 1,500 Bcf mark.  However, if weather       remains 15-20% warmer than normal, the probability of withdrawing       that much gas decreases substantially.       Longer-term, we continue to believe that natural gas fundamentals       will be a supply driven equation.  Based on fourth quarter production       volumes reported so far, it appears that U.S. natural gas production       will, in fact, show both sequential and year-to-year declines.       Despite the potential for near-term weakness in prices, we remain       bullish on the intermediate and longer-term fundamentals for natural       gas.      2) The American Petroleum Institute (API) reported that total petroleum    inventories decreased 5.5 MMBbls to 673.6 MMBbls for the week ended    February 15, 2002.     ?       The consensus range called for a 0.7 MMBbl build to a 2.4 MMBbl    build.  This is a bullish report for the oil market.  Total petroleum    inventories are currently 73.5 MMBbls (~12%) above levels one year ago.     ?       Crude oil inventories decreased 4.5 MMBbls to 316.2 MMBbls last    week.  Crude oil inventories are 37.5 MMBbls above last year at this    time.  Based on our current U.S. crude oil demand estimate, there are    approximately 17 days of crude oil inventory.       Motor gasoline inventories increased 0.6 MMBbl to 218.2 MMBbls last       week.  Motor gasoline inventories are 13.0 MMBbls above last year at       this time.     ?       Distillate fuel inventories decreased 1.6 MMBbls to 139.2 MMBbls    last week.  Distillate inventories are 23.0 MMBbls above last year at    this time.     ?       U.S. refinery operations were at a 88.5% utilization rate, which    was 0.7% higher than last week's 87.8% rate.  Total Petroleum imports    decreased to 10.4 MMBbls/day.       Despite last week's larger than anticipated draw in total petroleum       inventories, the slowdown in U.S. economic growth that was       exacerbated by the September 11 terrorist attacks has continued to       weigh on demand and contribute to inventory levels that remain well       above our 5-year average.      OILSERVICE     3) BJ Services Announces Another Strategic Acquisition.    ?       Yesterday, BJ Services (NYSE:BJS/$30.03/Strong Buy) announced    that it has signed a definitive merger agreement with OSCA, Inc.    (NASDAQ:OSCA/$27.65) for $28 per share (a 27% premium to the    pre-announcement stock price).  This all-cash deal equates to a total    purchase price of roughly $420 million and is expected to close by the    end of the second calendar quarter.     ?       OSCA provides a full array of completion-related products and    services, including completion fluids, completion tools and completion    services.  BJ should ultimately be able to leverage the incremental    products, services and markets across its existing asset and customer    base to yield significant pull-through revenue opportunities down the    road.  While it appears that BJ paid a full price for OSCA, the    combination makes a lot of strategic sense.     ?       Following the announced acquisition, we are making slight    modifications to our near-term estimates.  Specifically, we are shaving    a nickel from our existing FY2002 estimate, bringing it down to $1.25    per share.  This is primarily due to the closing of the acquisition    without significant near-term cost savings or pull through benefits.  As    management indicated on its conference call, it expects the deal to be    accretive to the FY2003 consensus of $1.85 per share by $0.06 to $0.07    per share.  Since we are already in print at $2.00, we are leaving our    FY2003 estimates unchanged in order to be conservative.  Given the    expected slight accretion to FY2003 earnings, combined with potential    longer-term upside and an improving market outlook, we are maintaining    our Strong Buy rating and 12-month target price of $37 per share.     4) Tetra Technologies beats consensus by a penny and appears extremely    undervalued relative to its peers!       Following yesterday's acquisition of OSCA by BJ Services, it is even       more clear now that Tetra Technologies (NYSE:TTI/$23.62/Strong Buy)       is cheap.       Specifically, OSCA was purchased for between 30-35x 2003 EPS, or       12-14x 2003 EBITDA.       If we apply those multiples to TTI, we come up with a value of $45 to       $55 per share, as opposed to the current price of $23.62 per share.       The TTI story is very similar to that of OSCA, only perhaps not as       well known.       Following OSCA's acquisition, there remains a chance that TTI could       be taken out at some point in time (although we have no reason to       believe it will be soon).       Furthermore, TTI stands a chance of gaining business as a result of       this transaction.       Finally, the company reported fourth quarter EPS of $0.35 per share,       a penny above consensus.  It will host a conference call today at       10:30am ET.  The dial in number is 800-860-2442.     5) Unit Corp. handily beats fourth quarter earnings expectations    ?       Unit Corp. (NYSE:UNT/$12.60/Strong Buy) reported fourth quarter    earnings of $0.27 per share, compared to $0.43 per share in the fourth    quarter of 2000.  This result was $0.04 ahead of the consensus estimate    of $0.23 per share.     ?       Revenues for the quarter came in at $49.3 million, down    approximately 25% from last year and down 28% from the third quarter.    Likewise, overall operating margins were down over 530 basis points    year-to-year to about 50%, while they were also down a like amount on a    sequential basis.     ?       The strong quarterly results were largely a result of    stronger-than-expected dayrates, utilization and margins during the    quarter.  In fact, average dayrates were down by only about $800 to just    under $10,200 per day.  Meanwhile, average realized oil and natural gas    prices reflected the current softer commodity price environment with    declines on a year-to-year basis of 41% for oil and 61% for gas.    Production volumes also decreased from last year by 2% for oil and 15%    for natural gas.     ?       Despite the generally strong results, drilling activity has    fallen dramatically over the past couple months.  This drop in overall    rig activity has had a significant impact on Unit's utilization,    dropping from a quarterly average of nearly 71% rigs in Q4 to the    current run-rate of 60%, pulling dayrates down another 10-15% currently.     ?       Due to declines in the near-term outlook for drilling and    production, combined with Unit's current activity indicators (dayrates,    utilization, production and commodity prices), we are adjusting our    quarterly estimates but keeping our annual estimates.  Accordingly, we    are maintaining our 2002 estimate of $0.80 per share and our 2003    estimate of $1.40 per share.  Despite the lack of near-term visibility,    the improving long-term outlook causes us to maintain our Strong Buy    rating with a 12-month target price of $18 per share (based on a blended    average of three valuation techniques).     6) Conrad Reports Very Disappointing Quarterly Loss       Conrad Industries (NASDAQ:CNRD/$4.10/Strong Buy) reported its fourth       quarter of a loss of $0.02 per share, compared to a profit of $0.10       per share in the fourth quarter of 2000.  This results missed the       consensus estimate by $0.14 per share.       Revenues for the quarter came in at $9.9 million, which was down 11%       from this same quarter last year and down 23% from last quarter.  The       gross margin for the quarter was 13.8%, which was down over 800 basis       points from the year ago period and down almost 800 basis points       sequentially.       The backlog at quarter-end stood at $10.4 million, down 49% from the       fourth quarter of 2000 but up 4% from last quarter.       The Company blamed the poor quarterly performance on weakness in the       economy and offshore oil and gas industry.       The Company will host a conference call at 10:30am ET this morning.       You may access the call by dialing 800-966-6502.  A replay will be       available by dialing 800-677-6200 and using access code 2280.     E&P     7) AEC Beats 4Q Expectations, EnCana Merger On Track       AEC (NYSE:AOG/Strong Buy) reported fourth quarter 2001 EPS of C$0.55       per share, which was ahead of our estimate of C$0.40 per share.       AEC achieved record sales averaging 356,000 Boe/d, up 20% from 2000.       Each of the three growth platforms - Canada, the U.S. Rockies and       Ecuador - set new records.       In 2001, AEC's established conventional reserves rose by 15% to       nearly 6 Tcf of gas and more than 600 million Bbls of oil and natural       gas liquids. The Company replaced 276% of 2001 conventional sales,       with 89% of the reserve additions coming through the drill bit. The       largest reserve additions were in the U.S. Rockies and northeast       British Columbia.       The merger with PanCanadian remains on track with shareholder's       meetings scheduled for early April and closing expected shortly       thereafter.       Alberta Energy's merger with PanCanadian Energy to form EnCana will       create the largest and fastest growing super independent producer in       the industry with a C$27 billion enterprise value and visible       production growth in excess of 14% annually for at least the next       five years. The combined company will have a dominant position in       North America with interests in western Canada, the U.S. Rockies,       offshore Eastern Canada and the Gulf of Mexico, as well as 23 million       undeveloped acres along the Rocky Mountain Fairway from southern       Colorado to Alaska.  EnCana will also have large international growth       engines in Ecuador and the North Sea.       Our target price of C$80 (US$52) is based on a 6.1x multiple of 2002       cash flow, a valuation comparable to that of its super independent       peers.  We reiterate our Strong Buy rating.     8) Pure Posts Stronger Than Expected 4Q Results, Reduces Capital Budget    for '02.       Pure Resources (NYSE:PRS/$19.90/Strong Buy) reported 4Q:01 EPS of       $0.00 per share, which was significantly higher than our estimate of       a loss of ($0.17) and the consensus estimate of ($0.13).       PRS's production during 4Q:01 totaled 390 Mmcfe/d, up 70% from the       same period last year, including acquisitions made during 2001,  and       up 85% for the full year.  However, the company lowered 2002 volume       guidance from 12% growth to 9% growth based on a reduced capital       spending program.  As a result, we have lowered our 2002 earnings       estimate from $0.32 to $0.31 per share to reflect the reduced       expectations.       Additionally, we are initiating 2003 EPS and CFPS estimates of $1.12       and $6.30, respectively, based on 11% production growth from 2002 to       2003 and average commodity prices of $3.75/Mcf of gas and $26.00/Bbl       of oil.       The Company replaced 385% of its production from all sources at a       cost of $1.82/Mcfe, and increased its total reserves by 34% to 1,469       Bcfe.       We are maintaining our Strong Buy rating on shares of Pure.  Through       experience, operational focus and the application of newer       technology, Pure has the opportunity to create significant value in       the ""mature"" Permian Basin.  Our target price of $24 is based on a       5.3x multiple of 2002 cash flow, a valuation justified by the       Company's geographical focus and operating leverage in the Permian       Basin.     9) XTO 4Q Results In-Line With Expectations.    ?       XTO Energy (NYSE:XTO/$17.10/Strong Buy) reported 4Q:01 EPS of    $0.42, which was in-line with our estimate of $0.41 and consensus of    $0.40.     ?       XTO's production during 4Q:01 totaled 565 Mmcfe/d, up 20% from    the same period last year and up 17% for the full year.     ?       Additionally, we are initiating 2003 EPS and CFPS estimates of    $2.19 and $5.27, respectively, based on 12% production growth from 2002    to 2003 and average commodity prices of $3.75/Mcf of gas and $26.00/Bbl    of oil.     ?       During the conference call, XTO mentioned that it may make an    acquisition in lieu of a portion of its organic production growth    through the drillbit.  More specifically, XTO may forego a portion of    its East Texas drilling budget and use $100-150 million towards an    acquisition.  Either way, XTO is expected to achieve its 17-20%    production growth target.     ?       XTO has a multi-year inventory of development opportunities in    the low-F&D cost Arkoma and San Juan Basins, as well as the East Texas    Freestone and Bossier Trends.  For an E&P company, XTO has a    large/diverse asset base, substantial project inventory, and multiple    productive zones in its core producing areas.  We are maintaining our    Strong Buy rating on shares of XTO based on the company's ability to    generate consistent double-digit production growth.  Our target price of    $24 is based on a 6.5x multiple of 2002 cash flow, a valuation justified    by the company's consistent and visible growth.

Clinton officials refused to finance only one out of 20 projects proposed by the energy company between 1993 and 2000 to build power plants, natural-gas pipelines and other big-ticket energy facilities around the world, according to the Export-Import Bank and the Overseas Private Investment Corp., the agencies that provided the subsidies.  In addition, the administration, which lauded Chairman Kenneth L. Lay as an exemplary ""corporate citizen,"" granted about $200 million worth of insurance against political risks for nine Enron projects in such politically volatile areas as Argentina, Venezuela and the Gaza Strip, according to documents the agencies provided to the Senate Finance Committee.  ""These projects obviously were a tremendous benefit to Enron's operations,"" said Sen. Charles E. Grassley, Iowa Republican and ranking minority member of the committee. He noted that the Reagan and Bush administrations approved no loans for Enron between 1985 and 1992 and provided insurance for only one Enron power project in Guatemala in 1992.  The Clinton administration provided three loans between 1994 and 1998 to the now-defunct Dabhol power project in India. Mr. Clinton's commerce secretary, Ron Brown, trumpeted the approval of the Dabhol loans on a trade mission to India in 1995, with Mr. Lay by his side.  The trip was one of 11 Clinton trade missions provided at taxpayer expense for corporate executives from Enron and other companies. The U.S. Trade and Development Agency, which sponsored the trips, also provided $1 million in funding to study Enron energy projects in Russia, Eastern Europe and former Soviet states.  As congressional committees dig for evidence to tie Enron and Mr. Lay to the Bush administration, evidence of Mr. Lay's links to the Clinton administration are ample and well-documented.  Mr. Lay at times was Mr. Clinton's golf partner and slept in the Lincoln Bedroom. Other top Enron officials attended the White House's infamous ""coffee klatches"" with Mr. Clinton, according to published reports.  Mr. Lay offered a seat on Enron's board of directors to Robert E. Rubin, Mr. Clinton's Treasury secretary, in 1999 just before he left government, the Associated Press reported yesterday. Mr. Rubin tried to get Treasury to intervene on behalf of Enron last fall when the company credit rating was threatened.  In May 1996, Mr. Clinton lauded Mr. Lay as a good ""corporate citizen"" at a White House event because of Enron's enlightened personnel policies, including profit-sharing of Enron stock and generous health and pension benefits. Enron employees now are suing because those benefits are as worthless as the bankrupt company's stock.  During the Clinton years, Enron contributed more than $1 million to the Democratic Party, including $600,000 to the Democatic National Committee, according to Federal Election Commission records. Mr. Clinton and Vice President Al Gore received contributions of $11,000 and $13,750, respectively, for their presidential campaigns.  One $100,000 contribution to the DNC was provided before India gave final approval to Enron's Dabhol project in June 1996. The largest and most expensive capital project ever undertaken in India, Dabhol was of dubious economic value and never went on line.  The World Bank, on reviewing the project, said it was not economically viable and inordinately benefited Enron, which was a 65 percent owner. Enron still owes $203 million on an Export-Import Bank loan for the project, which the bank says is covered by guarantees provided by five Indian banks.  Congressional aides said it is not clear what the taxpayers' liability will be for that and other loans now that Enron is bankrupt. The Export-Import Bank said its loans were extended to overseas subsidiaries of Enron and not the bankrupt corporation. The overseas investment agency said its exposure is limited to paying any missed premiums on Enron's political risk insurance.  Top Clinton officials lobbied personally to obtain Indian state guarantees for the Dabhol project after it encountered early problems in 1995. Thomas F. ""Mack"" McLarty, the White House chief of staff, made it a top administration priority to keep the project from failing. The Bush administration has continued efforts to salvage the project.  Clinton Energy Secretary Hazel O'Leary led a succession of missions to India, and Mr. Clinton's ambassador to India, Frank Wisner, was charged with keeping the project afloat. After Mr. Wisner left government in 1997, he took a seat on the board of directors of a company then controlled by Enron. Mr. McLarty also performed work for Enron after leaving the administration.   ----------------------------------------------------------- This article was mailed from The Washington Times (http://www.washtimes.com/business/20020221-74571848.htm) For more great articles, visit us at http://www.washtimes.com  Copyright (c) 2001 News World Communications, Inc.

As you will recall from your discussions with Stuart Z, this is a self funding transaction where ENA will (1) sell gas in the ground (storage); (2) pay post-petition storage demand costs; and, (3) put in (third party) escrow the pre-petition amounts until such time as a mutually agreeable arrangement can be reached and the appropriate estate approval for settling pre-petition obligations are received.   As more fully described in the attached Batch Funding Request, the net proceeds to the estate will be approx. $1.7 million with funding anticipated in the first week of March.     Call with questions.

By carbon copy of this email, I am sending it to Chip and Gerald for their review and comment (Chip and Gerald should accept all changes to simplify their review given that this is their first pass at it).  Chip is up to speed on this deal (I spoke with him about this last week).  I am not sure whether Gerald knows anything about this transaction, but his skill set and knowledge base make him the ideal lawyer for this arrangement.   Gerald - I would truly appreciate it if you would look at this.  The good news on this transaction is that there is very little in the way of documentation.  Your insight would be invaluable given your Bridgeline dealings.   Thanks in advance.

We still need to take care of the deer lease food/beer issues. ....whenever. FYI John (Wollam) is fine. Has a pulled muscle in his neck. Enjoyed eating eyes, eye socket fatty tissue, head meat, talking about how much I care for my dog, eating heart meat, men playing with their meat,  bowel distress and ""grapes"" and seeing how it played out for the one MAN  audience. I doubt Dave Wieland will join us again and Ted will likely be asked to turn  down the next invitation to join us by his friend. I give the food an A+, service was also excellent. Chad gets the award for being most ""in"" to the effort. I will mark my calendar for 60 days to rip a thread for the next effort. e.   _________________________________________________________________ Join the world's largest e-mail service with MSN Hotmail.  http://www.hotmail.com   ********************************************************************** This e-mail is the property of Enron Corp. and/or its relevant affiliate and may contain confidential and privileged material for the sole use of the intended recipient (s).

The following is his response to Centana's counsel email.  I did discuss with Mark this morning, the current course we are following with Centana and he agreed it made sense.    As it stands now we would sell all the gas in-place to Centana and they would net out post-petition fees.  Our business people feel that we have used the storage services post-petition and consequently those fees would be an administrative expense.  An amount equivalent to the pre-petition fees would be held in escrow until the bankrutpcy court resolved the pre-petition amounts.

At the very beginning of Mike Richards' email he lists all of his claims.  -----Original Message----- From: Nemec, Gerald [mailto:Gerald.Nemec@ENRON.com] Sent: Tuesday, February 19, 2002 12:32 PM To: Proctor, Shemin V.; Mann, Kay Cc: mark.ellenberg@cwt.com Subject: FW: FW: Gas Storage Agreement with Duke Energy Field Services   Kay,  Mark is aware of this transaction.  The following is his response to Centana's counsel email.  I did discuss with Mark this morning, the current course we are following with Centana and he agreed it made sense.    As it stands now we would sell all the gas in-place to Centana and they would net out post-petition fees.  Our business people feel that we have used the storage services post-petition and consequently those fees would be an administrative expense.  An amount equivalent to the pre-petition fees would be held in escrow until the bankrutpcy court resolved the pre-petition amounts.   All remaining amounts would be delivered to Enron North America.    >  -----Original Message----- > From:  ""Mark Ellenberg"" <Mark.Ellenberg@cwt.com>@ENRON   > Sent: Friday, February 15, 2002 8:22 AM > To: Nemec, Gerald > Cc: melanie.gray@weil.com; david.wolnerman@weil.com; Mann, Kay > Subject: Re: FW: Gas Storage Agreement with Duke Energy Field Services >  >  > He is wrong on just about every point.

WE DO NOT OFFICIALLY COVER CPN.  CPN released a press release stating that it had completed a portion of its long awaited $2B credit line.  The new credit facility includes a new $1.0B and an amended $400MM revolving credit facility (expiring May, 2004).  A 2 year $600MM term loan (as pre-released in the S&P press release a few weeks ago) is expected to be completed within the next 30 days.  CPN has agreed to pledge interest in its natural gas producing properties, the Saltend power plant in the UK and its equity investments in nine US power plants. The nine US power plants represent additional securitization relative to the information included in the S&P press release (a negative relative to expectations).  In addition, CPN presented a Sources and Uses of Cash estimate for FY02 that showed a cash cushion of $1.4B.  However, this estimate included $2.2B in sources of cash that are contingent on future events.  Sources of cash remaining to be secured include: 1) the $600MM term loan (expected to close within 30 days), 2) a $500MM California peaker lease (difficult, considering the fact that it is backed by a DWR contract that the Governor is attempting to renegotiate), 3) the sale of $250MM in non-strategic assets (expected to close by the end of 2Q), 4) a $300MM Canadian royalty trust to monetize its Canadian powr generation assets (expected by the end of 2Q), 5) a $150MM sale-leaseback of its Zion power plant (expected by the end of 2Q), 6) $260MM financing of future turbine purchases that are supported by long-term PPAs (no timing target set), and, 7) the sale of the Gilroy accounts receivable from PG&E (which is in bankruptcy) of $175MM (transaction could take place by the end of 3Q).  In addition, our combined cycle spot margin indicators are suggesting that the spot market has been very weak y-t-d ($3.75/MWh average margin and a 65% utilization rate) relative to CPN's earnings guidance spot assumptions ($8/MWh margin and 70% to 80% utilization), suggesting that CPN's earnings guidance ($1.70/sh) and cash flow generation expectations may be too aggressive.  We continue to believe CPN is very speculative issue and that bankruptcy is a real possibility.  Based on what we know about the name, we are sellers.  CPN has scheduled a conference call today at 10am PST, 12pm CT and 1pm ET.

"   -----Original Message----- From:  Office of the Chief Executive   Sent: Tuesday, March 12, 2002 10:28 AM To: DL-GA-all_domestic Subject: Defining Debtor and Non-Debtor Companies   Nothing about bankruptcy is easy, and because of Enron's size, ours is especially complex.  So it is understandable that there might be confusion among employees of Enron's various debtor and non-debtor companies surrounding the bankruptcy.  To clarify, debtor-in-possession, or debtor, companies are the legal entities of Enron that have filed for bankruptcy - their business activities are subject to the review and approval of the Creditors' Committee and the bankruptcy court.  Non-debtor companies are legal entities owned or controlled by Enron that have not filed for bankruptcy - for the most part, non-debtor companies are able to operate their business as usual.  The estate is made up of the combined assets and liabilities of Enron, which include some holdings in non-debtor companies.  It is important to note that at the beginning of March there were approximately 20,000 Enron employees in non-debtor companies, and about 3,500 Enron employees in debtor companies.  Distinctions between debtor and non-debtor companies become especially relevant for employees as we begin to roll out components of a transitional compensation program.  As we work through restructuring, components of the program will apply differently to employees of debtor and non-debtor companies.  For example, earlier this year some non-debtor companies were able to pay performance bonuses and merit increases to their employees as part of the ordinary course of business.  Another example is severance.  Going forward, we can anticipate gradual reductions in our workforce.  Given the uncertainty of our situation, we realize the importance of providing a ""safety net.""  Severance provides employees a degree of financial security in the event their jobs are terminated in the future.  Some non-debtor companies were able to recently institute a new severance plan for their employees.  This was possible because the plan did not require the approval of the bankruptcy court.  While the severance plan for debtor companies will be different than the plan for non-debtor companies, severance is part of a comprehensive retention and severance plan that will go to the bankruptcy court for approval.  Employees of debtor companies will be covered by either severance or retention.  Retention will become part of the compensation program for some employees, primarily those in debtor companies.  Retention offers employees an incentive to stay with the company to help develop a new business entity, to liquidate non-core assets, or to unwind the affairs of the estate.  Retention is not a measure of past performance, but is intended to retain key employees whose skills or historical knowledge are critical to preserve or generate the greatest value for the estate and its creditors.  Additionally, we are now finalizing merit increases and promotions for employees of debtor companies.  Supervisors in those companies will soon begin communicating merit increases or promotions to their employees.  We hope this information further clarifies the bankruptcy's impact on our individual businesses, but more importantly, we hope it helps to establish realistic expectations and reduce some uncertainty for you as employees.

During the period 12/4-12/31/01, Duke Field Services inadvertently flowed gas on the MRT pipeline to ENA. ENA used the gas received from Duke Field Services to fulfill its obligations under the sales agreement to One Oak.    ENA is obligated to pay Duke Field Services for the gas it received and later delivered to One Oak because this event occurred post-petition and benefited ENA.

With the recent surge in U.S. natural gas prices many analysts are scratching their heads in disbelief. Of course there will continue to be volatility, but we believe these higher gas prices are not only sustainable, but will likely move up through the summer (similar to what happened in 2000). For the past two months it has become very evident that U.S. natural gas supply/demand on a weather-adjusted basis is much tighter than the same time last year. The market has finally begun to realize the extent of this tightness, as more ""normal"" weather over the past several weeks has removed a substantial amount of the natural gas storage overhang. This shift in supply/demand should become even more evident as we move into the early part of the injection season in April/May. Look for summer gas injections to be down 30% to 50% from last year's numbers. This should be the bullish driver of summer natural gas prices.  Next week, we should have even more bullish gas news, as the preliminary numbers from our first quarter U.S. E&P production survey are likely to surprise many on the Street. Stay tuned....

Some of the comments we previously discussed on the phone.  I understand my business person is having discussions with Enron management to try and resolve a number of issues with Enron.  Therefore, the results of those discussions may cause additional comments from us to this Letter Agreement..  In addition, my business person is currently out of the office, so these comments are subject to his review and additional changes.  We are fine with the Escrow Agreement as long as it is understood that Enron will pay all costs associated with the Escrow Agreement.

Bellemare Vice President=20     <http://secure.scientech.com/images/spacer.gif>  [News item from Reuters] Renewed concerns over accounting irregularities an= d heavy debt burdens took their toll on the power sector on Wednesday, send= ing shares of independent producers and traders falling. The downturn was t= riggered by disclosures in The Wall Street Journal (WSJ) of a financing arr= angement used by Dynegy Inc. (NYSE: DYN) which prompted unwelcome compariso= ns to Enron as well as an inquiry by the Securities and Exchange Commission=  (SEC) into energy trader and pipeline operator Williams Cos. (NYSE: WMB).= =20  Analysis: Just when the market conditions appeared to be stabilizing for th= e recently hard-hit independent power producers (IPPs), more unwanted bad n= ews has once again plagued this sector. In addition to Dynegy and Williams,=  companies such as Calpine, Mirant and AES have had significant news in the=  past week as the companies make moves to weather the storm of business los= ses, lowered credit ratings, softening energy commodity prices, and questio= ns of accounting practices. Let's take a look at the latest developments fo= r these companies.=20  Dynegy shares closed at $28.79 per share, down by about 4 percent, as the m= arket reacted to a WSJ article concerning Dynegy's use of off-balance-sheet=  transactions designed to cut tax bills and address a growing gap between c= ash flow and net income. Project Alpha, as it was called, was blessed by Dy= negy's former auditor, Andersen, and current auditor PricewaterhouseCoopers= . Dynegy was quick to try and distinguish this transaction from the type of=  business practices that Enron engaged in. Dynegy spokesman John Sousa emph= asized, ""The primary drivers of this transaction were that it provided us w= ith a long-term source of physical gas supply and a significant tax benefit= ."" Sousa also pointed out that no related parties were involved, Dynegy sto= ck was not used to back the loans, and the transaction was disclosed in Dyn= egy's financial reports last year. In 2000 the company reported ""unrealized=  gains"" of $354 million generated by valuing derivative contracts, increasi= ng the gap between its profit and cash flow. Trading companies include the = estimated value for ""derivative"" contracts they use for future buying and s= elling of commodities in net income as ""unrealized gains."" A special purpos= e entity (SPE) was formed in April of last year with a $300-million loan fr= om Citigroup Inc. The SPE entered into gas trades with a partnership called=  DMT Supply LP, in which Dynegy held a stake. According to Dynegy, during t= he first nine months of operation, DMT bought gas from the entity at below-= market prices and resold the gas at a profit. But during future years of th= e project scheduled to end in 2006, DMT will buy gas at above-market gas pr= ices, generating unrealized losses. By arranging transactions in this manne= r, Dynegy was able to lower its 2001 tax bill by $80 million. But according=  to WSJ, higher values were being assigned to derivative contracts than tho= se assigned to cash transactions which creates a ""disconnect"" between repor= ted net income and cash flow that investors could notice.=20  Williams shares also dropped by 4.5 percent on Wednesday to close at $23.08=  per share on news from WSJ, which reported that the SEC is looking into th= e company's third-quarter results. In reaction, Williams clarified that it = had received a request in early February from the SEC for additional inform= ation concerning the company's 2001 third-quarter results but was told afte= r a review that no financial adjustments were needed. Williams' spokesperso= n Jim Gipson said, ""We received an informal, confidential request for infor= mation by the SEC in early February about our third-quarter 10Q. They asked=  a couple of questions, we responded in writing, they called back in seven = days and said no amendment to the third-quarter results was required."" Gips= on emphasized that, ""We are not aware of any unresolved or open issues at t= he SEC."" Williams reported a third-quarter net income of $221.3 million, up=  from $176.5 million, or 27 cents a share, earned in the same quarter one y= ear ago. The quarter included a one-time charge of $71 million for the comp= any's investment in former subsidiary Williams Communications Group. On Mar= ch 7, Williams announced it had taken a $2.1-billion charge in the fourth q= uarter to account for its contingent liability on Williams Communications. = Williams reported a loss of $477.7 million for the fourth quarter.=20  Calpine shares were down 6.26 percent yesterday apparently in reaction to n= ews that Moody's had downgraded Calpine's unsecured debt from Ba1 to B1, al= ong with a negative ratings outlook. Approximately $12.4 billion of long-te= rm debt instruments are affected. This follows a March 29 report, when the = company disclosed that it will restate 2001 earnings after the company disc= overed that emission-reduction credits it had purchased last year were not = actually available. In a press release, Calpine said 2001 earnings would be=  lowered by $11.5 million after tax from the $659.6 million reported on Jan= . 31. The restatement will drop 2001 diluted earnings per share after extra= ordinary items by 3 cents a share, to $1.87.=20  Moody's sited several reasons for the ratings downgrades including Calpine'= s high leverage, limited financial flexibility, and substantial ongoing cap= ital expenditure requirements to complete its reduced build-out program. Ca= lpine's debt is expected to grow over the coming year as the company contin= ues its development of committed projects. While Calpine's total electric s= ales are expected to increase as it completes additional plants, it is expe= cted to be selling into unfavorable market conditions. Moody's anticipated = that lower spark spreads (the difference between electric and fuel prices) = will lower in the near term. Moody's warned that the negative outlook refle= cts the possibility of additional downgrades should Calpine's liquidity pos= ition further deteriorate or its cash flow fall below expectations. Calpine=  plans to fund completion of 22 gas-fired power projects and 2 project expa= nsions during 2002 and 2003. Moody's also assigned a Ba3 rating to Calpine'= s $2 billion of senior secured credit facilities. According to Moody's, the=  Ba3 rating reflects the benefits and limitations of Calpine's collateral p= ackage. A portion of the collateral package consists of Calpine's equity in= terests in Saltend and nine U.S. power plants. A principal part of the coll= ateral package is Calpine's natural-gas properties, which may be subject to=  fluctuation in value based on changes in reserves and gas prices. Moody's = claims a portion of these gas reserves is not proven.=20  Mirant also continues to experience hard times. Its shares were down 6.21 p= ercent to close at $13.60 per share. Although yesterday's downturn may have=  largely been driven by the overall downturn in the sector, Mirant has been=  involved in several interesting announcements this week as it continues to=  try to shore up its balance sheet. On April 1 it was reported that Mirant = has put its Kogan Creek power station and Wilkie Creel coal mine in Queensl= and up for sale. Queensland's government-owned CS Energy, currently 40-perc= ent owner of Kogan Creek, is reported to be a potential buyer, as are MIM a= nd Macarthur Coal. In a separate transaction announced on March 27, Cleco a= greed to buy Mirant's 50-percent interest in a 725-megawatt power plant the=  companies are building in northeastern Louisiana. The merchant power plant=  is owned by a joint venture between the two companies. Cleco said it would=  assume Mirant's $19.5-million equity commitment and pay $48 million to ret= ire Mirant's project debt. Cleco said it would finance the buyout with a co= mbination of new common stock and debt.=20  AES has also fallen on tough times. Although the company's stock was up yes= terday to close at $8.96 per share, the company continues to struggle. Earl= y this week, AES sent a shockwave through the U.K. market when it announced=  its decision to put its 363 MW Fifoots Point coal-fired power plant locate= d in Wales into receivership. The recommissioning of Fifoots in late-1999 w= as funded with a $214.5-million loan arranged and underwritten by Deutsche = Bank. Richard Hill, joint administrative receiver at KPMG in London, who is=  charged with selling the asset, says Fifoots has some GBP80 million of non= -recourse bank debt obligations as well as other liabilities that have yet = to be fully determined. Similar to the U.S. market, wholesale prices in the=  U.K. reportedly have collapsed by 30 percent after the launch of last spri= ng's new bilateral trading system. Accordingly, one report claims at least = a dozen project loans are either in technical default, have broken their co= venants, or are very close to not meeting their coverage ratio.=20  In other AES-related news this week it was announced that GE would be purch= asing AESGener's 40-percent stake in the Servicios Integrales de Generacion=  de Energia Electrica (Sigen) services company for an undisclosed amount. G= E already owned 60 percent of the joint venture. AESGener, controlled by AE= S, posted losses of Pesos $5,027mil in 2001 compared to a profit of Pesos $= 2,275mil in 2000. Operating results were down by 12.5 percent to Pesos $70,= 241mil on sales declining 23.8 percent to Pesos $347,009mil. The performanc= e of AES' Argentinean subsidiaries TermoAndes and InterAndes, and selling o= ff the subsidiaries Central Puerto and Puerto Ventanas imposed losses. Rece= ntly appointed AESGener Chairman Roberto Morgan commented that the company = will continue to divest in non-electric assets and assets not based in Chil= e.=20  The fallout of the Enron debacle, lowered credit ratings, and weak commodit= y prices are providing a 1-2-3 blow that has many energy companies on the r= opes struggling to make the bell. The companies are aggressively working to=  put up a defense by shoring up their balance sheets through asset sales, p= ostponing or canceling projects and taking necessary write-offs. But as qui= ckly as these companies' fortunes have nosedived, they can rise once again.=  Such is the fickle nature of the commodity world.=20   An archive list of previous IssueAlert articles is available at www.scientech.com <http://secure.scientech.com/issuealert/>=20     _____ =20  ""I am an avid fan of your newsletter.

Bellemare Vice President=20     <http://secure.scientech.com/images/spacer.gif>  [News item from Reuters] Renewed concerns over accounting irregularities an= d heavy debt burdens took their toll on the power sector on Wednesday, send= ing shares of independent producers and traders falling. The downturn was t= riggered by disclosures in The Wall Street Journal (WSJ) of a financing arr= angement used by Dynegy Inc. (NYSE: DYN) which prompted unwelcome compariso= ns to Enron as well as an inquiry by the Securities and Exchange Commission=  (SEC) into energy trader and pipeline operator Williams Cos. (NYSE: WMB).= =20  Analysis: Just when the market conditions appeared to be stabilizing for th= e recently hard-hit independent power producers (IPPs), more unwanted bad n= ews has once again plagued this sector. In addition to Dynegy and Williams,=  companies such as Calpine, Mirant and AES have had significant news in the=  past week as the companies make moves to weather the storm of business los= ses, lowered credit ratings, softening energy commodity prices, and questio= ns of accounting practices. Let's take a look at the latest developments fo= r these companies.=20  Dynegy shares closed at $28.79 per share, down by about 4 percent, as the m= arket reacted to a WSJ article concerning Dynegy's use of off-balance-sheet=  transactions designed to cut tax bills and address a growing gap between c= ash flow and net income. Project Alpha, as it was called, was blessed by Dy= negy's former auditor, Andersen, and current auditor PricewaterhouseCoopers= . Dynegy was quick to try and distinguish this transaction from the type of=  business practices that Enron engaged in. Dynegy spokesman John Sousa emph= asized, ""The primary drivers of this transaction were that it provided us w= ith a long-term source of physical gas supply and a significant tax benefit= ."" Sousa also pointed out that no related parties were involved, Dynegy sto= ck was not used to back the loans, and the transaction was disclosed in Dyn= egy's financial reports last year. In 2000 the company reported ""unrealized=  gains"" of $354 million generated by valuing derivative contracts, increasi= ng the gap between its profit and cash flow. Trading companies include the = estimated value for ""derivative"" contracts they use for future buying and s= elling of commodities in net income as ""unrealized gains."" A special purpos= e entity (SPE) was formed in April of last year with a $300-million loan fr= om Citigroup Inc. The SPE entered into gas trades with a partnership called=  DMT Supply LP, in which Dynegy held a stake. According to Dynegy, during t= he first nine months of operation, DMT bought gas from the entity at below-= market prices and resold the gas at a profit. But during future years of th= e project scheduled to end in 2006, DMT will buy gas at above-market gas pr= ices, generating unrealized losses. By arranging transactions in this manne= r, Dynegy was able to lower its 2001 tax bill by $80 million. But according=  to WSJ, higher values were being assigned to derivative contracts than tho= se assigned to cash transactions which creates a ""disconnect"" between repor= ted net income and cash flow that investors could notice.=20  Williams shares also dropped by 4.5 percent on Wednesday to close at $23.08=  per share on news from WSJ, which reported that the SEC is looking into th= e company's third-quarter results. In reaction, Williams clarified that it = had received a request in early February from the SEC for additional inform= ation concerning the company's 2001 third-quarter results but was told afte= r a review that no financial adjustments were needed. Williams' spokesperso= n Jim Gipson said, ""We received an informal, confidential request for infor= mation by the SEC in early February about our third-quarter 10Q. They asked=  a couple of questions, we responded in writing, they called back in seven = days and said no amendment to the third-quarter results was required."" Gips= on emphasized that, ""We are not aware of any unresolved or open issues at t= he SEC."" Williams reported a third-quarter net income of $221.3 million, up=  from $176.5 million, or 27 cents a share, earned in the same quarter one y= ear ago. The quarter included a one-time charge of $71 million for the comp= any's investment in former subsidiary Williams Communications Group. On Mar= ch 7, Williams announced it had taken a $2.1-billion charge in the fourth q= uarter to account for its contingent liability on Williams Communications. = Williams reported a loss of $477.7 million for the fourth quarter.=20  Calpine shares were down 6.26 percent yesterday apparently in reaction to n= ews that Moody's had downgraded Calpine's unsecured debt from Ba1 to B1, al= ong with a negative ratings outlook. Approximately $12.4 billion of long-te= rm debt instruments are affected. This follows a March 29 report, when the = company disclosed that it will restate 2001 earnings after the company disc= overed that emission-reduction credits it had purchased last year were not = actually available. In a press release, Calpine said 2001 earnings would be=  lowered by $11.5 million after tax from the $659.6 million reported on Jan= . 31. The restatement will drop 2001 diluted earnings per share after extra= ordinary items by 3 cents a share, to $1.87.=20  Moody's sited several reasons for the ratings downgrades including Calpine'= s high leverage, limited financial flexibility, and substantial ongoing cap= ital expenditure requirements to complete its reduced build-out program. Ca= lpine's debt is expected to grow over the coming year as the company contin= ues its development of committed projects. While Calpine's total electric s= ales are expected to increase as it completes additional plants, it is expe= cted to be selling into unfavorable market conditions. Moody's anticipated = that lower spark spreads (the difference between electric and fuel prices) = will lower in the near term. Moody's warned that the negative outlook refle= cts the possibility of additional downgrades should Calpine's liquidity pos= ition further deteriorate or its cash flow fall below expectations. Calpine=  plans to fund completion of 22 gas-fired power projects and 2 project expa= nsions during 2002 and 2003. Moody's also assigned a Ba3 rating to Calpine'= s $2 billion of senior secured credit facilities. According to Moody's, the=  Ba3 rating reflects the benefits and limitations of Calpine's collateral p= ackage. A portion of the collateral package consists of Calpine's equity in= terests in Saltend and nine U.S. power plants. A principal part of the coll= ateral package is Calpine's natural-gas properties, which may be subject to=  fluctuation in value based on changes in reserves and gas prices. Moody's = claims a portion of these gas reserves is not proven.=20  Mirant also continues to experience hard times. Its shares were down 6.21 p= ercent to close at $13.60 per share. Although yesterday's downturn may have=  largely been driven by the overall downturn in the sector, Mirant has been=  involved in several interesting announcements this week as it continues to=  try to shore up its balance sheet. On April 1 it was reported that Mirant = has put its Kogan Creek power station and Wilkie Creel coal mine in Queensl= and up for sale. Queensland's government-owned CS Energy, currently 40-perc= ent owner of Kogan Creek, is reported to be a potential buyer, as are MIM a= nd Macarthur Coal. In a separate transaction announced on March 27, Cleco a= greed to buy Mirant's 50-percent interest in a 725-megawatt power plant the=  companies are building in northeastern Louisiana. The merchant power plant=  is owned by a joint venture between the two companies. Cleco said it would=  assume Mirant's $19.5-million equity commitment and pay $48 million to ret= ire Mirant's project debt. Cleco said it would finance the buyout with a co= mbination of new common stock and debt.=20  AES has also fallen on tough times. Although the company's stock was up yes= terday to close at $8.96 per share, the company continues to struggle. Earl= y this week, AES sent a shockwave through the U.K. market when it announced=  its decision to put its 363 MW Fifoots Point coal-fired power plant locate= d in Wales into receivership. The recommissioning of Fifoots in late-1999 w= as funded with a $214.5-million loan arranged and underwritten by Deutsche = Bank. Richard Hill, joint administrative receiver at KPMG in London, who is=  charged with selling the asset, says Fifoots has some GBP80 million of non= -recourse bank debt obligations as well as other liabilities that have yet = to be fully determined. Similar to the U.S. market, wholesale prices in the=  U.K. reportedly have collapsed by 30 percent after the launch of last spri= ng's new bilateral trading system. Accordingly, one report claims at least = a dozen project loans are either in technical default, have broken their co= venants, or are very close to not meeting their coverage ratio.=20  In other AES-related news this week it was announced that GE would be purch= asing AESGener's 40-percent stake in the Servicios Integrales de Generacion=  de Energia Electrica (Sigen) services company for an undisclosed amount. G= E already owned 60 percent of the joint venture. AESGener, controlled by AE= S, posted losses of Pesos $5,027mil in 2001 compared to a profit of Pesos $= 2,275mil in 2000. Operating results were down by 12.5 percent to Pesos $70,= 241mil on sales declining 23.8 percent to Pesos $347,009mil. The performanc= e of AES' Argentinean subsidiaries TermoAndes and InterAndes, and selling o= ff the subsidiaries Central Puerto and Puerto Ventanas imposed losses. Rece= ntly appointed AESGener Chairman Roberto Morgan commented that the company = will continue to divest in non-electric assets and assets not based in Chil= e.=20  The fallout of the Enron debacle, lowered credit ratings, and weak commodit= y prices are providing a 1-2-3 blow that has many energy companies on the r= opes struggling to make the bell. The companies are aggressively working to=  put up a defense by shoring up their balance sheets through asset sales, p= ostponing or canceling projects and taking necessary write-offs. But as qui= ckly as these companies' fortunes have nosedived, they can rise once again.=  Such is the fickle nature of the commodity world.=20   An archive list of previous IssueAlert articles is available at www.scientech.com <http://secure.scientech.com/issuealert/>=20     _____ =20  ""I am an avid fan of your newsletter.

Tim Stuart is the President of Louis Dreyfus Energy Services, which is primarily the liquids trading business at present. (go to: http://www.louisdreyfus.com/, click ""energy"", and ""petrochemicals"". Here is the generic recruiting email I sent out:  I request your assistance in gathering names of candidates for an ENERGY EXECUTIVE search.  My Client: An $18 billion GLOBAL COMMODITY TRADING organization.  The Opportunity: Through acquisitions and joint ventures, to BUILD AN ASSET BASED ENERGY TRADING COMPANY with the objective of monetizing the optionality around those assets.  The Candidate: A STRATEGIC VISIONARY, capable of building a value oriented organization, and capitalizing upon financial and physical trade arbitrage opportunities.  Bottom line is they want back in to the physical business and they are looking for the lead person to do it. The preference is to base them in Wilton, CT but they will also consider Houston. Besides experience trading a ""physical gas book"", this person must have strong entrepeurnial and strategic instincts. Which assets should they buy? Why? Which joint venture relationships make sense and why? These issues require someone with a big picture understanding and vision of the energy industry and an understanding of how to evaluate and monetize the optionality of assets. Some people may be great traders, but they don't have the aggressiveness and vision to direct the business side of this venture. Some people may have strong ""asset"" background but they don't understand how to manage a trade group to squeeze the most value from assets through sophisticated and creative trading strategies. This position requires both. I would like to put your resume in front of them. Your recent experience trading around the Bridgeline system would be of interest. Please let me know what you think?

Enron was paying for a pretty large weather package from us, so it may be a steep cost to get the entire package. Were there just certain products you were using? For example, our basic package, which includes the 1-15 day maps, the 16-city forecasts, the 30-day outlook, and phone access is $450/month. The noon update would be an additional $150/month. Since you are a smaller group, I can apply a discount as well...perhaps as much as 20%. Let me know what products you were using from the site and I can put together a package and quote for you fairly quickly. I'm attaching our standard price sheet for your reference as well.

We are sending you this email to let you know that we have updated our Privacy Policy. You can read our updated Privacy Policy by visiting Yahoo!'s comprehensive Privacy Center <http://privacy.yahoo.com/>.  Our commitment to privacy hasn't changed. We believe that you should understand what we do with your information and what choices you have. So why are we revising our Privacy Policy? To streamline it and make changes to address several important topics.  In recent years, we have added a Children's Privacy Policy and Privacy Information for users of Yahoo!'s financial products and services, in accordance with requirements of federal legislation. We at Yahoo! have become increasingly aware of questions about how data is treated when a user's safety may be at risk, when fraud or illegal activities may be occurring, or when companies are combined. We feel that the time is right to streamline our privacy policies into a single, comprehensive policy and to address these and other issues in the process. Please take a moment to visit our Privacy Center <http://privacy.yahoo.com/privacy/us/> and read our updated Privacy Policy. (Note: The Yahooligans! Privacy Policy, for our children's web site, has not changed. Although the format and some parts of the Yahoo! Privacy Policy have been updated, our collection, use, and treatment of information from kids under age 13 remains unchanged.)  In order to keep you up to date about our many new products and services and how they might be of use to you, we have created a new Marketing Preferences <http://subscribe.yahoo.com/showaccount> page within the Account Information area. It is designed to make it easier for you to manage the marketing communications you receive from Yahoo! and ensure you get the latest relevant information to meet your needs. We have reset your marketing preferences and, unless you decide to change these preferences, you may begin receiving marketing messages from Yahoo! about ways to enhance your Yahoo! experience, including special offers and new features. Your new marketing preferences will not take effect until 60 days after the date of this mailing so you have plenty of time to decide what you want to receive and what you don't. To change your preferences, go to the Marketing Preferences <http://subscribe.yahoo.com/showaccount> page.  Yahoo! recognizes that while we've grown and changed, things in your life have probably also changed. You may have a new job, a different email address, a new house or different interests. We invite you to take this opportunity to update your personal information <http://edit.yahoo.com/config/eval_profile?.src=&.done=http://privacy.yahoo.com/privacy /us/> so you can continue to receive content and advertising that is most relevant and interesting to you.

That service is a hybrid that we offer to both our clients and theirs. The cost for the service is $6600/year. You may want to check with PIRA on your arrangement with them, but typically this is sold separately.  I'll put a contract together for you with the basic, noon, and an applied discount to account for your group's smaller size.  Thanks!

I also had a question, does this package include the forecast on storage from pira?  We are a Pira client already so I just need clarification on that.   Let me know then we'll finalize.

Thanks  Greg Schockling  -----Original Message----- From: Matt Rogers [mailto:mrogers@earthsat.com] Sent: Monday, April 08, 2002 8:18 AM To: Schockling, Gregory Subject: RE: Weather repiort   Greg,  Good morning. Enron was paying for a pretty large weather package from us, so it may be a steep cost to get the entire package. Were there just certain products you were using? For example, our basic package, which includes the 1-15 day maps, the 16-city forecasts, the 30-day outlook, and phone access is $450/month. The noon update would be an additional $150/month. Since you are a smaller group, I can apply a discount as well...perhaps as much as 20%. Let me know what products you were using from the site and I can put together a package and quote for you fairly quickly. I'm attaching our standard price sheet for your reference as well.

Tim Stuart is the President of Louis Dreyfus Energy Services, which is primarily the liquids trading business at present. (go to: http://www.louisdreyfus.com/, click ""energy"", and ""petrochemicals"". Here is the generic recruiting email I sent out:  I request your assistance in gathering names of candidates for an ENERGY EXECUTIVE search.  My Client: An $18 billion GLOBAL COMMODITY TRADING organization.  The Opportunity: Through acquisitions and joint ventures, to BUILD AN ASSET BASED ENERGY TRADING COMPANY with the objective of monetizing the optionality around those assets.  The Candidate: A STRATEGIC VISIONARY, capable of building a value oriented organization, and capitalizing upon financial and physical trade arbitrage opportunities.  Bottom line is they want back in to the physical business and they are looking for the lead person to do it. The preference is to base them in Wilton, CT but they will also consider Houston. Besides experience trading a ""physical gas book"", this person must have strong entrepeurnial and strategic instincts. Which assets should they buy? Why? Which joint venture relationships make sense and why? These issues require someone with a big picture understanding and vision of the energy industry and an understanding of how to evaluate and monetize the optionality of assets. Some people may be great traders, but they don't have the aggressiveness and vision to direct the business side of this venture. Some people may have strong ""asset"" background but they don't understand how to manage a trade group to squeeze the most value from assets through sophisticated and creative trading strategies. This position requires both. I would like to put your resume in front of them. Your recent experience trading around the Bridgeline system would be of interest. Please let me know what you think?

"Congrates Jack!  -----Original Message----- From: Jack Belcher [mailto:jbelcher@chemweek.com] Sent: Monday, April 29, 2002 1:31 PM To: Undisclosed-Recipient:@mailman.enron.com; Subject: My New Position   Dear friends and colleagues,   I wanted to inform you that I am leaving Hart Publications shortly to take a position as the Majority Staff Director of the House Subcommittee on Energy and Mineral Resources. The Subcommittee is part of the House Committee on Resources and has jurisdiction over oil and gas development, coal and hard rock mining and geothermal energy development on federal lands including the offshore Gulf of Mexico, Rocky Mountains and Alaska. My last day at Hart is May 10 and I start at the Subcommittee on May 13.  I am looking forward to this new opportunity though I have had a great experience at Hart Publications and Hart Downstream Energy Services and I am really going to miss the people I work with here. Hart is really like a family - in the Washington office and in Houston. I can't speak highly enough about the organization and the professional people I have worked with for over eight years.  <?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = ""urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office"" />  If you want to reach me at the Subcommittee, the number is (202) 225-9297. I believe that my email will be jack.belcher@mail.house.gov <mailto:jack.belcher@mail.house.gov>  I look foward to staying in touch.  Sincerely,  Jack  Jack Belcher Deputy Director, Governmental Affairs Energy & Refining Policy Hart Downstream Energy Services p) 301.354.2036 f)  301.424-7260 c) 703.863-4309 jbelcher@chemweek.com <mailto:jbelcher@chemweek.com>",jbelcher@chemweek.com,joe.parks@enron.com,RE: My New Position,2002-04-29 11:34:28-07:00,sent

Over the past six months we have been very bullish on U.S. energy stocks based upon our conviction that U.S.  natural gas supply would deteriorate sharply with the reduced drilling activity. As publicly-traded U.S. E&P  companies have begun to announce their first quarter production results, the supply deterioration has been shocking even to us. Specifically, with about one-third of total U.S. gas production represented, it appears that first quarter 2002 U.S. gas production is trending down about 3% sequentially and more than 6% on a year-over-year basis. As we move into the second quarter, we think we will continue to see sequential declines in U.S. gas production and a growing year-over-year gap in U.S. gas production. Since a supply problem is much harder to correct than a demand problem, it appears that our optimism on U.S. gas prices has not only been well founded, but may even prove to be too conservative. In other words, this falling U.S. natural gas supply is an extremely bullish data point for U.S. gas prices as we move into the summer and especially going into next winter.

Information contained in this report is not to be considered as an offer to sell or a solicitation to buy commodities, nor do we make guarantees.  Kase will not be responsible for any typographical errors.  Expressions of opinion are subject to change without notice.  Hypothetical performance results have many inherent limitations, some of which are described below. No representation is being made that any account will or is likely to achieve profits or losses similar to those shown.  In fact, there are frequently sharp differences between hypothetical performance results and the actual results subsequently achieved by any particular trading program. One of the limitations of hypothetical performance results is that they are generally prepared with the benefit of hindsight.  In addition, hypothetical trading does not involve financial risk, and no hypothetical trading  record can completely account for the impact of financial risk in actual trading.  For example, the abilities to withstand losses or to adhere to a particular trading program in spite of trading losses are material points that can also adversely affect actual trading results.  There are numerous other factors related to the markets in general or to the implementation of any specific trading program that cannot be fully accounted for in the preparation of hypothetical performance results and all of which can adversely affect actual trading results.

You should therefore carefully consider whether such trading is suitable for you in light of your financial condition.  Information contained in this report is not to be considered as an offer to sell or a solicitation to buy commodities, nor do we make guarantees.

Hypothetical performance results have many inherent limitations, some of which are described below. No representation is being made that any account will or is likely to achieve profits or losses similar to those shown.  In fact, there are frequently sharp differences between hypothetical performance results and the actual results subsequently achieved by any particular trading program. One of the limitations of hypothetical performance results is that they are generally prepared with the benefit of hindsight.  In addition, hypothetical trading does not involve financial risk, and no hypothetical trading  record can completely account for the impact of financial risk in actual trading.  For example, the abilities to withstand losses or to adhere to a particular trading program in spite of trading losses are material points that can also adversely affect actual trading results.  There are numerous other factors related to the markets in general or to the implementation of any specific trading program that cannot be fully accounted for in the preparation of hypothetical performance results and all of which can adversely affect actual trading results.

Hypothetical performance results have many inherent limitations, some of which are described below. No representation is being made that any account will or is likely to achieve profits or losses similar to those shown.  In fact, there are frequently sharp differences between hypothetical performance results and the actual results subsequently achieved by any particular trading program. One of the limitations of hypothetical performance results is that they are generally prepared with the benefit of hindsight.  In addition, hypothetical trading does not involve financial risk, and no hypothetical trading  record can completely account for the impact of financial risk in actual trading.  For example, the abilities to withstand losses or to adhere to a particular trading program in spite of trading losses are material points that can also adversely affect actual trading results.  There are numerous other factors related to the markets in general or to the implementation of any specific trading program that cannot be fully accounted for in the preparation of hypothetical performance results and all of which can adversely affect actual trading results.

(NYSE: CVX <http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=cvx&d=t> - News <http://biz.yahoo.com/n/c/cvx.html>) faces nothing but unsavory options over its downtrodden investment in Dynegy Inc. (NYSE: DNY <http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=dny&d=t> - News <http://biz.yahoo.com/n/d/dny.html>), such as swallowing a huge loss and walking away, or increasing its entanglement with the troubled energy trader.      The deep pockets of the second-largest U.S. oil company could ensure the survival of Dynegy, the Houston-based power trading company reeling from regulatory probes, fears of possible credit rating downgrades and a stock in free-fall.   But ChevronTexaco might cut its losses, or it may sit tight and hope Dynegy can recover from a spiral that eerily resembles the demise of bankrupt energy trader Enron Corp. (Other OTC: ENRNQ.PK <http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=enrnq.pk&d=t> - News <http://biz.yahoo.com/n/e/enrnq.pk.html>)   ""ChevronTexaco is between a rock and a hard place,"" said Fadel Gheit, an oil analyst at Fahnestock & Co. ""After all this, are they just going to put in additional money to bail out Dynegy?""   San Francisco-based ChevronTexaco said it has a ""vested interest"" in Dynegy's success, but declined to comment on any possible actions it might take. The company owns 26.5 percent of Dynegy, a stake that has lost nearly three-quarters of its value since Dynegy offered to take over Enron in November.   Speculation that ChevronTexaco may have to pump more money into the company comes as Dynegy has been forced to put up as much as $300 million in collateral for energy transactions over the past week, even as U.S. and European energy traders have scaled back business with the company.   Already, Dynegy's credit rating is in danger of falling to ""junk"" levels. Credit rating agency Moody's Investors Service has put Dynegy's credit rating in on review, while rival credit agency Standard & Poor's has placed Dynegy's short- and long-term credit ratings on CreditWatch.   ""If Dynegy is downgraded to junk, they'll have to raise considerable equity and my guess is the only source of that equity is ChevronTexaco,"" said Gene Gillespie, an analyst with Howard, Weil, Labouisse.   Dynegy shares fell 57 cents, or 5.8 percent, to an almost three-year low of $9.31. ChevronTexaco's stock has not been rocked by the power trading sector's woes. Its shares rose $2.15, or 2.4 percent, to $90.10.   BOARD'S ROLE   Dynegy is also the subject of several probes, including one by the SEC into a natural gas deal, ""Project Alpha,"" that cut the company's tax bill by $80 million. Another probe is looking into ""wash trades"" intended solely to boost trading volumes.   ChevronTexaco's silence since Dynegy's troubles have come to light has worried analysts.   When credit rating agency Standard & Poor's placed Dynegy's short- and long-term credit ratings on CreditWatch last week, it said it was ""concerned about the lack of any public statement of support"" from ChevronTexaco ""in this period of market tumult"" for Dynegy.   ""If the situation deteriorates, I would not be surprised if ChevronTexaco might have to take over Dynegy,"" said James Elliot, a portfolio manager with Dominick & Dominick Advisors.   Also at issue is how much ChevronTexaco might have known about the various trades under investigation. Three ChevronTexaco executives sit on Dynegy's board, including Chief Financial Officer John Watson.   ""It would be more of a disaster if an investigation revealed that the board was aware of what Dynegy was doing,"" said Gheit. ""I hope not, because that would reflect very poorly on ChevronTexaco.""   He added that bailing out Dynegy ""would be the biggest disaster because now ChevronTexaco would inherit all the potential liabilities of Dynegy. The creditors and government agencies that saw Enron slip out of their fingers will go after ChevronTexaco .""   Chevron acquired the stake in 1996, before its merger with Texaco, when Dynegy precursor NGC Corp. bought Chevron's natural gas business.   ChevronTexaco has the option to increase its stake in Dynegy to 36 percent by redeeming $1.5 billion in convertible preferred shares in the company. It acquired those shares last year to facilitate Dynegy's planned purchase of Enron.

(NYSE: CVX <http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=cvx&d=t> - News <http://biz.yahoo.com/n/c/cvx.html>) faces nothing but unsavory options over its downtrodden investment in Dynegy Inc. (NYSE: DNY <http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=dny&d=t> - News <http://biz.yahoo.com/n/d/dny.html>), such as swallowing a huge loss and walking away, or increasing its entanglement with the troubled energy trader.      The deep pockets of the second-largest U.S. oil company could ensure the survival of Dynegy, the Houston-based power trading company reeling from regulatory probes, fears of possible credit rating downgrades and a stock in free-fall.   But ChevronTexaco might cut its losses, or it may sit tight and hope Dynegy can recover from a spiral that eerily resembles the demise of bankrupt energy trader Enron Corp. (Other OTC: ENRNQ.PK <http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=enrnq.pk&d=t> - News <http://biz.yahoo.com/n/e/enrnq.pk.html>)   ""ChevronTexaco is between a rock and a hard place,"" said Fadel Gheit, an oil analyst at Fahnestock & Co. ""After all this, are they just going to put in additional money to bail out Dynegy?""   San Francisco-based ChevronTexaco said it has a ""vested interest"" in Dynegy's success, but declined to comment on any possible actions it might take. The company owns 26.5 percent of Dynegy, a stake that has lost nearly three-quarters of its value since Dynegy offered to take over Enron in November.   Speculation that ChevronTexaco may have to pump more money into the company comes as Dynegy has been forced to put up as much as $300 million in collateral for energy transactions over the past week, even as U.S. and European energy traders have scaled back business with the company.   Already, Dynegy's credit rating is in danger of falling to ""junk"" levels. Credit rating agency Moody's Investors Service has put Dynegy's credit rating in on review, while rival credit agency Standard & Poor's has placed Dynegy's short- and long-term credit ratings on CreditWatch.   ""If Dynegy is downgraded to junk, they'll have to raise considerable equity and my guess is the only source of that equity is ChevronTexaco,"" said Gene Gillespie, an analyst with Howard, Weil, Labouisse.   Dynegy shares fell 57 cents, or 5.8 percent, to an almost three-year low of $9.31. ChevronTexaco's stock has not been rocked by the power trading sector's woes. Its shares rose $2.15, or 2.4 percent, to $90.10.   BOARD'S ROLE   Dynegy is also the subject of several probes, including one by the SEC into a natural gas deal, ""Project Alpha,"" that cut the company's tax bill by $80 million. Another probe is looking into ""wash trades"" intended solely to boost trading volumes.   ChevronTexaco's silence since Dynegy's troubles have come to light has worried analysts.   When credit rating agency Standard & Poor's placed Dynegy's short- and long-term credit ratings on CreditWatch last week, it said it was ""concerned about the lack of any public statement of support"" from ChevronTexaco ""in this period of market tumult"" for Dynegy.   ""If the situation deteriorates, I would not be surprised if ChevronTexaco might have to take over Dynegy,"" said James Elliot, a portfolio manager with Dominick & Dominick Advisors.   Also at issue is how much ChevronTexaco might have known about the various trades under investigation. Three ChevronTexaco executives sit on Dynegy's board, including Chief Financial Officer John Watson.   ""It would be more of a disaster if an investigation revealed that the board was aware of what Dynegy was doing,"" said Gheit. ""I hope not, because that would reflect very poorly on ChevronTexaco.""   He added that bailing out Dynegy ""would be the biggest disaster because now ChevronTexaco would inherit all the potential liabilities of Dynegy. The creditors and government agencies that saw Enron slip out of their fingers will go after ChevronTexaco .""   Chevron acquired the stake in 1996, before its merger with Texaco, when Dynegy precursor NGC Corp. bought Chevron's natural gas business.   ChevronTexaco has the option to increase its stake in Dynegy to 36 percent by redeeming $1.5 billion in convertible preferred shares in the company. It acquired those shares last year to facilitate Dynegy's planned purchase of Enron.

Over the past several weeks, numerous analysts' reports have suggested there has been a massive destruction of gas demand, as gas prices have recently moved above $3.50/mcf. We believe the foundation for many of these reports is both poor analytical methodology and bad data. To conclude that weather-adjusted natural gas demand has fallen by 5 to 10 bcf per day implies a demand deterioration level similar to what we saw in early 2001, when prices soared to near $10 per mcf. Unlike then, today's fuel-switching incentives still favor natural gas. Secondly, there is little economic incentive for today's industrial consumers of natural gas to shut down plants in an improving economic environment. The current economy is very different than the deteriorating economic environment in early 2001.   The attached file is in the Adobe Acrobat *.PDF format.

From a technical analysis standpoint, the oilservice group looks like       it will trade sideways to down over the next month.  On the       fundamental analysis side, there are no visible positive catalysts       expected until July, when we should see: 1) a rollover in API       inventories, 2) lower natural gas injections with warmer weather, and       3) further evidence of natural gas supply declines in second quarter       natural gas production data.       While the oil markets have typically seen builds in total petroleum       inventories into July, it has experienced larger-than-expected builds       over the past few weeks.  The energy market is likely to view this as       a very bearish sign.       We should note that a possible contributor to these abnormal builds       is that Iraq was exporting as much oil as possible 45 days ago before       it cut off April/May exports in protest to the U.S. and Israel.       Bottom line: The charts and fundamentals suggest we could continue to       see some weakness in both oil prices and energy stocks over the next       4 weeks.  Based upon strong longer-term (6 to 9 month) fundamentals,       however, we believe investors should take advantage of any potential       weakness over the next month and buy the stocks in anticipation of       meaningful year-end upside.     2) The API reported that total petroleum inventories increased 8.3    MMBbls, to 669.0 MMBbls for the week ended May 31, 2002.       The average consensus range called for a 0.5 MMBbl draw to a 0.8       MMBbl build in total inventories.  This build in total inventories is       very bearish for the oil market.       Total inventories built largely as a result of much higher crude       supplies, as well as greater distillate supplies.       Total petroleum inventories are currently 27.2 MMBbls (~4%) above       levels one year ago, and continues to climb above the five-year       average.       Motor gasoline inventories decreased by 0.8 MMBbls to 217.7 MMBbls       last week, and are now 8.3 MMBbls above last year at this time.       Distillate fuel inventories rose by 2.8 MMBbls to 127.2 MMBbls last       week.  Distillate inventories are now 20.0 MMBbls above last year at       this time.       U.S. refinery operations were at a 93.4% utilization rate, which was       1.1% higher than last week's 92.3% rate, and much higher than       expectations of an ~0.25% increase.  Total petroleum imports       decreased slightly to 11.8 MMBbls/day.     OILSERVICE    3) Nabors' Re-incorporation Receives Independent Shareholder Group    Endorsement       Nabors Industries (AMEX:NBR/$40.00/Strong Buy) announced that       Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) has recommended that Nabors       shareholder vote in favor of the re-incorporation in Bermuda.  ISS is       the leading independent provider of proxy analysis and voting       advisory services.       Yesterday, Nabors' Chairman and CEO Gene Isenberg repeated his belief       that the proposed re-incorporation will result in significant tax       savings and other long-term benefits for the Company that will       outweigh the one-time capital gains taxes that investors will have to       pay if the move is approved.       A lawsuit that has been filed to try to block the vote appears to be       innocuous, as it is not even on the court docket for a scheduling       hearing until September and no motions for injunction have been filed       yet.       A special stockholders meeting to vote on the re-incorporation has       been scheduled for June 14(superscript: th).  We currently expect       that the proposal will pass the shareholder vote.        E&P     4) Spring Fire Stops Short of Evergreen Resources'    (NYSE:EVG/$43.90/Strong Buy) Coal Bed Methane Operations in Southern    Colorado.     ?       Evergreen reported that the Spring fire in southern Colorado's    Las Animas County did not reach the company's coal bed methane    operations in the Raton Basin.     ?      The fire crossed into Evergreen's acreage but stopped one and a    half miles short of the company's nearest well location.     ?      As a precaution, Evergreen shut-in 69 gas wells in the Lorencito    Canyon area.  These wells were producing at a combined rate of 6.2    million cubic feet (MMcf) of gas per day prior to being shut-in at    approximately 5:00 p.m. (MDT), Sunday, June 2.     ?      This daily production rate represents approximately 5% of    Evergreen's current total gross sales of 124 MMcf of gas per day.     ?      Production from the Lorencito Canyon area was brought back on    line yesterday at about 1:00 p.m. (MDT) and is expected to reach its    prior average rate within the next several days.     ?      According to latest reports, the Spring fire is mostly contained.    Evergreen has made its produced water available to assist fire-fighting    efforts in the area, and  does not expect future curtailments of its    production unless weather and fire conditions change significantly.     5) ONEOK (NYSE:OKE/$20.78/NR) Sells Equity Interest in Magnum Hunter    Resources (Amex:MHR/$7.31/Buy).    ?       ONEOK announced it has sold its remaining equity interest in    MHR, representing 4.9 million shares (~7%) of Magnum Hunter's 70 million    shares outstanding.     ?      The $35.8 million proceeds from this sale will be used to reduce    ONEOK's outstanding commercial paper.    ?      ONEOK, Inc. is a diversified energy company involved primarily in    oil and gas production, natural gas processing, gathering, storage and    transmission in the mid-continent areas of the United States.     6) Vintage Petroleum (NYSE:VPI/$11.65/Buy) Reiterates Commitment to    Business Plan and Reduction Of Indebtedness; Rejects Restructuring    Proposal.     ?       VPI believes that its current depressed stock price is    attributable primarily to its position in Argentina, which has    experienced a series of economic and political shocks, and Vintage's    relatively high leverage, which the company is committed to reducing.     ?      Vintage recently announced several initiatives to reduce    leverage, including the intention to reduce the Company's aggregate    indebtedness by $200 million by year-end 2002 through a combination of    the sale of non-core assets and cash flow in excess of planned capital    expenditures     ?      In response to the BP Capital Energy Restructuring Plan submitted    on May 15, Vintage said that it has reviewed the plan, and concluded    that it is not appropriate for the Company to pursue.  BP Capital    currently owns ~8.9% of the outstanding Vintage common stock.     ?      The restructuring proposal calls for the liquidation of Vintage's    North American assets, creating a pure-play Latin American exploration    and production company.     7) Anadarko Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:APC/$49.88/Market Perform)    Apparent Winner On 34 Tracts in National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska Lease.     ?       Anadarko announced that it was the apparent high bidder on a    total of 34 tracts in Monday's National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska Oil and    Gas Lease Sale 2002.     ?      Anadarko and its partner, Phillips Alaska Inc., submitted winning    bids representing a combined total investment of $9.6 million ($2.7    million net to Anadarko).     ?      The 34 tracts cover more than 282,000 gross acres and are located    primarily west of the companies' Moose's Tooth discovery.     ?      With this sale -- the second since the federal government resumed    leasing in the reserve in 1999 -- Anadarko's leasehold in NPR-A will    total 277,500 net acres.

If a few people in the Bush administration start thinking that the US trade  picture needs to change...... you may have heard the last utterance of anyone  saying they want a strong USD.......     The US current account deficit in Q1 2002 was $112.5 bln....  So the US has to  attract $37.50 bln per month to keep this in balance......   to do so either  asset prices need to go lower or the USD has to go lower......  both is  happening.....     Well, the US trade deficit is getting closer to 4.5%  of GDP.  Just the  deficit.... and just extrapolate that for the CA deficit.......     So the EUR just popped up over .9600 and a boatload of stops were just done  into the .9625-30.  And now will have settled in at .9610. There are no  retracements in the EUR, just quiet periods of consolidation.

Japan overnight announced that their May trade surplus rose 715% y/y.......  Anything that climbs over 700 % is not normal...... most of Japan's trade  surplus with the rest of Asia rose 626%......     But every month,  Japanese authorities will need to vacuum up about $7 bln USD  just to keep the YEN stable against the USD,  as the current imbalance in trade  creates pressures for a firmer YEN.......

Bank of Japan foreign reserves in USD is over $400 bln these days and climbing,  (I think $406 bln in April and $419 bln in May)........ Maybe Japan will  someday dollarize........

(The US commerce department has  the CAD surplus at $4.1 bln....)     SGD at 1.7775.... firmest level since last October.

" --------- Inline attachment follows ---------  From:  <mguido@Hess.com> Date: Thursday, June 20, 2002 4:09:52 GMT Subject:    Subject: FW: Revisions to EIA Monthly and Weekly Gas Storage Estimates      Listed below is the EIA explanation that was released at the time of week's storage data.  Revisions to EIA Monthly and Weekly Gas Storage Estimates Measures of working gas, base gas, and total gas in storage for March 2002 based on the EIA monthly survey of all gas storage operators were released on June 19, 2002, along with revisions for the months of November 2001 through February 2002 in the Natural Gas Monthly.  The March monthly data provided the first opportunity since the beginning of the EIA weekly natural gas storage survey to compare the reports of monthly and weekly surveys for weekly sample members for a comparable report period (the end of March for the monthly survey and the weekly surveys for the Fridays preceding and following the end of March). As a result of the cross-survey data comparison, a number of questions were directed to the respective respondent contacts. Many of these questions have been resolved, resulting in new or revised submissions of data for either the monthly or weekly surveys. Although most respondents have been prompt, a few questions remain. Reasons for revisions in monthly and weekly data include resolution of: ? Companies' reporting responsibilities for their field operations ? Questions about how joint operations of a field should be reported ? Questions about whether gas should be identified as base or working gas Revisions to Derived Weekly Estimates. The recent revisions to EIA monthly data for November 2001 through February 2002 required reestimation of the derived estimates for the weeks in that period to conform to the methodology for the derived estimates. The derived estimates (which are calculated to provide comparison to prior years) are weekly stock estimates calibrated to the EIA monthly surveys. (A description of the methodology is available at http://tonto.eia.doe.gov/oog/info/ngs/history.html.) Changes to the derived estimates will occur whenever the EIA monthly volumes for periods prior to March 2002 are revised. Eventually, weekly estimates based on the EIA weekly survey (Form EIA-912) will be available for all prior period comparisons.  The largest revision to any derived weekly stock estimate for the weeks during November 2001-February 2002 is an increase of 50 Bcf, or 1.6 percent, for the November 30, 2001, estimate. This adjustment is composed of increases of 31 Bcf in the Consuming East Region and 19 Bcf in the Producing Region. These changes represent 1.6 percent and 2.1 percent of inventories in the respective regions. Revisions to total stocks and those stocks in the Consuming East Region and the Producing Region in any other week are 1.6 percent or less. However, revisions to the data for the Consuming West Region have a higher relative impact, partly owing to the smaller working gas volumes for that region.  Revisions to Weekly Data from the EIA-912 Survey. On June 20, 2002, the weekly working gas stock estimates from the EIA-912 survey were revised for all weeks from March 15, 2002, through June 7, 2002. These changes represent an increase of 30 Bcf on average for all weeks from March 15 to June 7. As a result of the revisions, inventories in all three regions are higher. The average change for U.S. total inventories is less than 2 percent. The largest average revision occurred in the East Region, where the stocks increased by 3.2 percent. Revisions occurred in inventory levels for all weeks and consequently had little effect on the net change estimates, which reflect the movement in inventory estimates for two consecutive weeks. The revisions to weekly estimates were the result of revised data reports and the use of updated ratios for expansion of the sample reports. The use of ratios based on monthly surveys is explained in the Methodolog",joe.parks@enron.com,gschockl@sequentenergy.com,Fwd: FW: Revisions to EIA Monthly and Weekly Gas StorageEstimates,2002-06-20 09:46:15-07:00,received
