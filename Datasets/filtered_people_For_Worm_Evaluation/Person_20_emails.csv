"05/14/2001  Enron North America Corp. Vince Kaminski 1400 Smith Street 30th Floor, Rm. 3036B Houston, TX 77251-1188 1 713-853-3848  Dear Vince Kaminski,  This is to inform you of the release of @Energy2.1. FTP download instructions are available immediately. The download instructions are included at the end of this email.    Please see below for more information regarding this new release..  FEA is pleased to enclose your new version of @ENERGY/ErgLib. The accompanying documentation contains installation and other information.  Here is an overview of the new and changed features since Version 2.0.  @ENERGY (Forward Curve) No change.  @ENERGY (Basics) A control variate methodology Hull (1997) has been implemented for valuation of American options (OPT), Black and Mean-reverting models. It greatly improves accuracy at minimal cost in speed. All models now supports new scalar risk measures corresponding to parallel displacement delta, hedge, and gamma.  Average price/strike options now support an alternative way of computing theta. The definition of Gamma curves has been modified for all models.  @ENERGY (Advanced) A faster and more accurate methodology is used to value spread options. Models affected are SPREADOPT, STRIPSPREADOPT, OPTSPREADOPT, OPTSTRIPSPREADOPT. The new methodology dramatically improves speed. All models now supports new scalar risk measures corresponding to parallel displacement delta, hedge, and gamma.  Average price/strike options now support an alternative way of computing theta. The definition of Gamma curves has been modified for all models.  @ENERGY (Swing) The definition of Gamma curves has been modified for all models.  @ENERGY (Weather) No change.  See the file fea\energy\ergnote.txt in your distribution for a list of bug fixes.  Here is an overview of the new and changed features since Version 1.6.  @ENERGY (Forward Curve) Jump parameters are now calibrated for use in other @ENERGY functions. Inputs and outputs to POWERCALIB and COMCALIB have changed. See the corresponding function syntax in the User Guide for additional information. 35-40% speed improvement. The module is now out of beta.  @ENERGY (Basics) Different interpolation schemes on forward prices are now supported. If you use INDEXSWAP , EXOTICSWAP, or OPTINDEXSWAP with floating price linked to a series of futures dates, such futures dates need not be close to dates specified in the forward curve input.  A new utility function, PATHUTIL, allows you  to simulate and visualize price paths consistent with the models supported by @ENERGY. 25-30% speed improvement.  @ENERGY (Advanced) Different interpolation schemes on forward prices are now supported. If you use OPTDIFFSWAP or DIFFSWAP  with floating price linked to a series of futures dates, such futures dates need not be close to dates specified in the forward curve input. CALSPREADOPT now allows for the specification of two different mean reversion rates. 30-35% speed improvement.  @ENERGY (Swing) SWINGOPT and STRIPSWINGOPT now allow for valuation of swing straddle contracts with overall load constraints. 65-70% speed improvement. The module is now out of beta.  @ENERGY (Weather) 30-35% speed improvement.  See the file fea\energy\ergnote.txt in your distribution for a list of bug fixes. If you are a user of the ErgLib library, please be aware of possible backward compatibility issues in calls to Eapo, Easo, Espreadapo, Espreadaso, and Ecrackapo.  See fea\energy\ergnote.txt for additional details.  Here is an overview of the new and changed features since Version 1.5.  @ENERGY (Basics) European options  and strips of European options now support valuation via a jump diffusion model (see OPT and STRIPOPT functions). Average price options (see the APO, SPREADAPO, CRACKAPO functions), and average strike options (see the ASO, SPREADASO functions) now allow for a direct input of the fixing dates.  @ENERGY (Advanced)  Includes two new functions, OPTSTRIPOPT and OPTSTRIPSPREADOPT for valuation of complex compound options.  If you are a user of the ErgLib library, please be aware of backward compatibility issues in calls to Eapo, Easo, Espreadapo, Espreadaso, and Ecrackapo.  See fea\energy\ergnote.txt for additional details.  Here is an overview of the new and changed features since Version 1.4.  @ENERGY (Forward Curve)  @ENERGY (Forward Curve) is the new module which includes functions designed to generate forward curves, volatility curves and mean reversion rates used in many other @ENERGY functions. Module in beta release.  @ENERGY (Basics)  APO's and ASO's: bug fixed when avg_starts < opt_expiry, and num_fixings=1.  @ENERGY (Advanced)  No change.  @ENERGY (Weather)  Additional ways of formatting the temperature data are now provided.  @ENERGY (Swing)  Pay_at_end with strips: previously implemented was pay at end of  all periods. Now implemented is pay at end of each subperiod. . Module still in beta release.   Bug fixes: 1) if max_const=min_const and max_const in not a multiple of the maximum daily amount (in previous version min_const was disregarded in this case). 2) in strip with global constraints: if allowed number of swings per period changes (currently this can only be due to calendar effects). 3) strip at index: index was incorrectly evaluated after first sub_period.  New Excel Templates  The following Excel workbooks and worksheets have been added:  powercalib.xls examples of generating @ENERGY parameters for power.  Add-in Manager Now supports function help. If template is open with the Add-in manager and function help is requested through the manager, the relevant portion of the documentation get displayed.

I am not optimistic primarily because this is handled out of Chennai, as it must since the parents are residents of Andhra Pradesh. Our earlier requests for visas from Chennai have been a very mixed bag, with us being turned down more often than not. The fact of the matter is that the visa officers in the respective consulates have incredible amounts of discretion and ability to say no. Once they say no, it is very difficult to reverse.  But I will go through our good contacts at the US Consulate in Mumbai, as this has had more success than us speaking directly to Chennai.   Wade     From: Vince J. Kaminski/ENRON@enronXgate on 05/11/2001 10:37 AM CDT To: Wade Cline/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT cc: Vince J. Kaminski/ENRON@enronXgate, Pinnamaneni Krishnarao/ENRON@enronXgate   Subject: Help for Krishnarao Pinnamaneni  Wade,  I am writing to ask you to help my associate, Krishnarao Pinnamaneni, who faces a very difficult personal situation. You probably remember Krishna from his visits to our Bombay office when he was helping you on a few projects.  A brief outline of the facts.  1. His wife is pregnant. She gave birth to their daughter, Pallavi, a few years ago after a very complicated pregnancy. Pallavi was a premature child and her survival was a miracle (we all thank the Almighty for this wonderful child). Current pregnancy is also very complicated.  2. Krishna invited his in-laws to visit and stay with them to care for his wife. The application for a  tourist  visa was denied and the reason given for the denial was that they had overstayed the term of the visa during the previous  visit. The irony is that they complied with the US laws: they had asked for an extension of the visa and the extension was granted.  The company can, of course, intervene on Krishna's behalf. Krishna made an  outstanding contribution to Enron (he is currently a VP) and to the American  society. I am sure that Ken Lay would have no objections to write a letter on his  behalf to the State Department.  I would prefer, however, to try informal channels first to avoid confrontational approach. It may be better for all the involved in the long-run.  I hope you can use your personal contacts to intervene on Krishna's behalf and ask for a reversal of the decision on humanitarian grounds.  I shall fax to you a copy of the decision.  Thanks.

"  Dear Dr Kaminsky,  on behalf of the Scientific Committee of the 2nd World Congress of the Bachelier Finance Society, it is my pleasure to invite you to give one of the plenary lectures.  The Bachelier Finance Society came into being in 1996 by the initiative of mathematical finance researchers who found the need to create an organization where academia and practitioners would meet and exchange ideas spanning on the crossroads between Finance, Economics, Econometrics, Insurance and Mathematics.  The conference is the Society's second biannual meeting and it will take place in the island of Crete, from June 12 to June 15, 2002. The other members of the Scientific Committee are G.Constantinides, M.Davis, F.Delbaen, D.Duffie, H.Foellmer, M.Jeanblanc and E.Platen. Either myself or any other member of the committee would be happy to discuss with you about the Conference and the Society.  Crete is one of the most beautiful greek islands. The conference will take place in a resort in Xersonissos, a picturesque site close to Irakleion and Knossos. The airfare (economy class) and all local expenses (lodging, meals and local transportation) will be covered.  We will all be honored by your presence.

" Vince:  This is the gentleman that wants to meet with you on the 29th?    -----Original Message----- From:  ""Steve Mitnick"" <SMitnick@earthlink.net>@ENRON [mailto:IMCEANOTES-+22Steve+20Mitnick+22+20+3CSMitnick+40earthlink+2Enet+3E+40ENRON@ENRON.com]  Sent: Monday, May 21, 2001 9:13 AM To: Crenshaw, Shirley Cc: VKamins@enron.com Subject: Energy Leader Consulting Generation Evaluator (EGE)  Shirley:  As requested, herein is information regarding the meeting with Vince Kaminski.   The presentation on the EGE tool's applications and the Allegheny Energy case study is timed to take an hour.  If the meeting is most conveniently scheduled for Tuesday, May 29, might I request it be set for late afternoon (as my other appointments are the next day).   And, as Vince will recall, I was Co-Leader of the energy consulting business of PHB Hagler Bailly, and developer of the Ramp Up, Real Time, 75check and Electric Strategy tools.  Presently, I am CEO of Energy Leader Consulting (ELC).     Background The U.S. power generation industry has become increasingly efficient in recent years.  Rapidly growing new entrants seek profit maximization aggressively.  Utilities, who still control most power plants, endeavor to adopt the entrants' methods.  Yet, inefficiency among many utilities remains widespread. Utility inefficiency arises from adherence to decades-old habits and in unit commitment and dispatch and planned maintenance scheduling.  Many utilities, notwithstanding the industry-wide trend towards profit maximization, cling to ingrained routines. Inefficiency can also arise from the diseconomies of small scale.  A utility may operate a relatively small system (fewer than a dozen plants).  A small system lacks portfolio diversification and perspective in its focus on its regulated customers, playing the wholesale market at the margin. For a variety of reasons, utilities are reluctant to cut back the starts of their generating units, let alone shut down any (even temporarily or seasonally).  Economically inefficient units continue to be committed, week after week, and run in the half-load range.     EGE Objectives EGE identifies and assesses generating units of a utility with questionable commitment routines.  Taking into account transmission and reliability factors, the procedure points towards profit opportunities that may be exploited by another industry participant.     I. An industry participant can use EGE as a basis for a medium or long-term wholesale power transaction with a utility; or to price wholesale power more aggressively, to take market share from the utility (i.e., compel changes in unit commitment habits).       II. An industry participant can use EGE to spot and quantify efficiencies that would come from a merger or acquisition.       III. A power plant developer can use EGE to estimate the incremental value a new plant will enjoy when the target utility's unit commitment routines inevitably become rationalized.     Specific EGE Concepts EGE reduces and analyses the extraordinary but unwieldy continuous emission monitoring data base intelligently focusing on profit opportunities.   It produces indicative statistics such as:     a. the frequency distribution of starts per week;     b. the frequency distribution of starts by day/15-minute segment during the week;     c. the frequency distribution of load level;     d. the frequency distribution of hours of operation per start;     e. average heat rate and approximate fully-allocated cost in the half-load range;     f. average ramp rate from the half-load range;     g. the frequency distribution of unused connected capacity during the highest demand hours; and     h. forced-off maintenance outage rate (where indicated). Indicative statistics are generally aggregated by month/year; in some cases, by temperature range.  (They can be by regional wholesale prices as well.)  EGE establishes if the target utility has changed unit commitment routines significantly in recent years. EGE is based upon uniquely timely actual hourly operating data.  EGE is now updated for the 4th quarter 2000 (through December 31, 2000).  EGE 1st quarter 2000 (through March 31, 2001) will be available approximately June 15, 2001. EGE also compares and ranks generating units' commitment and dispatch with that of similar units operated by the target utility (as well as other regional generators).  Some utilities operate a group of economically marginal units at the half-load level for lengthy time periods (without an apparent reliability basis), splitting the limited economic demand for power among the units. Other EGE supporting data:     i. planned maintenance schedule (where indicated);     j. actual maximum generating capacity;     k. actual minimum generating capacity (actual maximums and minimums can differ significantly from government-reported values);     l. average heat rate in the full-load range; and     m. average heat rate in the three-quarter-load range. With respect to a generating units' average heat rate in the half-load, three-quarter-load and full-load ranges, it can be instructive to rank these relative to similar generating units within a region.  It can also be of interest to identify significant seasonal variations in average heat rates and maximum capacities, and changes in recent years in these parameters.     The Real-World Example of Allegheny Energy Allegheny Energy can serve as a case study to illustrate the application of EGE.  In the 4th quarter 2000, for instance, one high-cost generating unit was started virtually every weekday morning (52 times) and committed for the whole day (in all but two cases).  Arguably, there are power products that could substitute for this routine (in part at least) at a profit to the seller of the product and Allegheny Energy. Another high-cost Allegheny Energy generating unit was started virtually every weekend during the autumn (nine times) and committed for most of the coming week.  At another plant, two high-cost units were operated too often in the expensive half-load range (some 550 hours) and three-quarter-load range (another 400 to 600 hours); they were seldom called upon to run at higher levels.  Again, there are power products that that address these practices and might appeal to Allegheny Energy.     Offering of Energy Leader Consulting (ELC) EGE is a procedure, not a software package or data base.  ELC believes this format is more effective in arming clients with the information they need to act upon profit opportunities. ELC transfers its ""knowledge"" about the EGE procedure and the supporting data methods in a straight-forward four-step process:     1. Enron would select one to three target utilities.     2. ELC would perform the EGE procedure on the target utilities.     3. Employing this real-world analysis as a pedagogic tool, ELC, in a one-day seminar with Enron personnel, would instruct how to perform the procedure in the future (without the assistance of ELC).     4.  Optionally, ELC would provide EGE supporting data, quarterly, to Enron. The basic EGE supporting data set is national including all generating units under the continuous emission monitoring program (virtually all fossil fuel units).  Parameters that are incorporated, and the data set format, will be specified upon request.  Custom modifications will be considered. ......................................................................... Steven A.

"Vince, I just spoke with Rakesh.  I believe that there is some confusion regarding which part of that Raptor transaction we are talking about.  There are actually two different sets of forwards: one for up to 18MM shares contingently based on price as an offset to the Whitewing forward shortfall, and the other was for 12MM shares which was more of a straight restricted forward contract on ENE shares.  We all went over the valuations on both sets of forwards pretty thoroughly back in March, and I'm certain that the valuations that were put together included the contingent nature of the forwards on the 18MM shares.  In fact, I believe that we had a meeting with a couple of managers from Arthur Andersen to discuss the general methodology.  Of course, the valuations on the 12MM shares had no such component.  Let me know if you have more questions or concerns.  Thanks Vince.

We were not aware of this conditionality at the time the project.  We can, however, easily, incorporate it in our valuation model. This omission makes our valuation more conservative form the Enron's point of view.   Please, let us know if this is required.

Obviously, I'd like to discuss this in detail with you as well, especially since you understand the characteristics of the models and data better now, but I'll do that via phone.

I did, however, get a message from Mark Palmer saying that he thought I should present our stuff on current operations value/future growth value directly to Andy Fastow. I agree this makes sense.

" Vince,  Over the weekend, I fomulated the idea using option pricing for the EOL  price seeting rules. The initial results look interesting.  I will write it up for your inputs.  Also attach is the program SnagIt, for printing window.  Zimin     -------------------- main idea ------------------------------  A market maker fulfills the obligation to provide liquidity, therefore he should be compensated for his service. In the option langauge, the market maker sells options to the traders, for a market order to buy, the market maker has to sell at the ask price and for a market order to sell, the market maker has to buy at the bid price. When the ask price is hit the trader exercised a call option against the market maker, when the bid price is lifted, the trader exercised a put. The option premium that the traders paid to the market maker is implicitly embedded in the bid-ask spread.  There is a capital requirement for the market making. In a rising (falling) market, the market maker will accumulate a net short (long) position. There are two kind of costs. The first is associated to carry the market-to-market(MTM) value to the next period. The market maker needs to charge a risk-free interest for the carrying the inventory to the next period. The second is the charge for the risk capital. If the ask (bid) were hit (lifted) in a rising (falling) market, the market maker would realized a loss reflecting the MTM change. Thus, the risk capital that the market maker laid aside is the amount of money that he is prepared to lose, in exchange for some return. The risk adjusted return on capital or RAROC rate reflects the risk attitude of the market maker in providing the liquid to the market participants.  In balance, the market maker sells options to compensate his costs in provide market liquidity. From this train of thoughts, I derive a formula for the bid and ask prices as function of the last executed price, inventory level, price volatility, trade size, order arrival rate, risk-free interest rate and RAROC rate. The limit orders are not considered here, since there are very few limit orders traded on EnronOnLine (EOL).",j.kaminski@enron.com,lu@enron.com,Options approach for EOL price setting,2001-05-29 07:29:51-07:00,received

As the positions are marked on their own curve but are valued for VAR purposes using the volatility curves and correlation factors for an energy curve, the VAR on these positions is obviously inaccurate.

"Good FICO Scores = Best Loan Rates!  FICO Scores (credit scores) are what the vast majority of American lenders use to evaluate creditworthiness. The scores range from the 300's to around 850, the higher the score, the lower the risk.  Most creditors keep this score a secret! Since this score is not generally given to the public, it is up to the lender to be honest. Let's face it, not all lenders are on the ""up and up."" KNOW YOUR SCORE!  Imagine calling a mortgage company, or walking into an automobile dealership KNOWING exactly what your credit scores are! You would no longer be at their mercy. You can shop for the best deals without having unnecessary inquiries on your credit report! Suddenly, the tables are turned and YOU HAVE THE UPPER HAND when shopping for a mortgage, automobile, or ANY type of financing.  There are three credit bureaus: EQUIFAX, EXPERIAN, and TRANS UNION. They each have a different score, depending on what information is on each report. Not all creditors report to all three credit agencies.  Until now, these ""secret scores"" were not available to the general public.  We can provide you with one, two, or all three (best deal) scores, so you can know where you stand in the eyes of loan grantors across the country.  Price per score is $10.US, or you may purchase all three scores for only $25.US. - per person!

"The Alchemy of Decision  Anguel Grigorov  I.  Introduction      The conventional economictheory goes to a great length in preaching that   people are rational when makingtheir decisions, be it an investment or a   divorce.  Yet many economists and decision-making theory scientists do   notsubscribe one hundred percent to this paradigm.  They claim that while   most people <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>strive to be rational   decision-makers, they are still subject tomany psychological limitations and   traps that may distract them from theirgoal.  Some scientists claim that   thesepsychological traps are a manifestation of millions of years of   evolutionduring which the mankind had developed herd instincts in order to   survive.  It is essential to notice that the influenceof these common biases   increases when uncertainty is present in the decisionsituation.             In thisarticle we will list a number of common psychological   biases that werediscussed in a recent book by three Harvard professors.   II.  The Biases   1.     TheAnchoring Trap-in considering a decision, the mind gives a   disproportionatelylarge weight to the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>  first informationit receives-anchoring effect. Anchors can take many   forms-statistical results,biased wording of the decision problem, past   events, trend availability, etc.  2.     The Status Quo Trap-most decision makers display a strong biastoward   alternatives that perpetuate the current situation.  3.     TheSunk-Cost Trap-Past decisions prey on our psyche.  4.     TheConfirming Evidence Trap-We seek only information that supports our   point ofview while avoiding information that contradicts it. In a word one   sees whatshe wants to see.  5.     TheFraming Trap-The way you ask a question can profoundly influence   the answer youget.  If you ask whether you can smokewhile praying, the answer   is likely to be emphatic No.  But if you ask whether you can pray   whilesmoking, you may get Yes.  6.     TheOverconfidence Trap-On average people tend to set too narrow   confidence levelsfor an uncertain event.  7.     TheRecallability Trap-One focuses on barely probable but dramatic   events.  8.     TheBase-Rate Trap-One tends to neglect relevant information by   referring to somestereotype (on average) image. Example: Mr. Jones is either   librarian or a salesman.  He is also retiring.  Whatis he?  Most people would   answerlibrarian, although in the US salesmen outnumber male librarians by 100   to 1.  9.     The Prudence Trap-You assign larger (than what is   reasonable)probability to an uncertain event. Basically you account for   uncertainty by being overly prudent andplaying conservatively.  10. TheOutguessing Randomness Trap-You see patterns where purely random   phenomenaexist.  11. TheGoing-Mystical-About-Coincidences Trap-If someone wins twice 1 in   1,000,000lottery, this does not necessarily mean that there is not randomness.  III.              Improving Our Judgment  The above are only someof a number of bad jokes our brain can play to us.  I   believe that once we are aware that our mind is not perfect,the most sensible   thing to do is to accept this.  Mind traps can be systematically studied,   quantified and used toconstantly improve our  judgment.  Here I will throw   some ideas of how this canbe done.    To begin with, we maytry to quantify our susceptibility to each of the known   traps.  Of course there is no objective way to dothis, but in my view this   doesn't mean that such an exercise is a futileone.  For example prior to   making adecision we may try to assign ourselves a score from 1 to 5 on our   perceptionof the influence of the anchoring trap on our decision.  We can do   this with every otherpsychological trap.  Then we will wait and recordthe result from our decision.  Say ifthe result   turned out to be as we had hoped to, we would put 1, and otherwise0.  This   exercise should be done for anumber of decision situations (say 100 trading   decisions).  At some point of time we will be in asituation in which we will   have quantitative information on our biases at thepoint of making a decision   and the results on our decision.  There are mathematical techniques   (saylogistic regression, neural networks, etc.) that can help us combine the   differentpieces of <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>a priori information   into asingle index that is associated to the largest possible extent with   thebeneficial final result.  We can alsoextract the probability of having a   beneficial result given some set of initialperceptions.  At the very least we   willbe able to put some weights on our pre-decision perceptions.  IV.             Conclusion  The main idea of thisarticle is that one's brain is susceptible to a variety   of psychologicalbiases.  This is a fact of life andshould be understood and   studied. Psychologists have already discovered a number of such biases.  If   we subscribe under the statement thattrading is not only a mechanical   manipulation of statistical data, but alsojudgment, insight and human   psychology, we may want to use and benefit fromsuch information.    The never-ending questfor designing an objective score based on publicly   available information thattells us how the market will behave in the future   may be quite doomed.  Indeed, the publicly available informationrepresents   either historical data or the average public opinion about thefuture.  There   should be some correctivefactor between public opinion and reality. In my   view this factor can be our judgment.  Judgment can be understood, cuddled,   educated and developed.  A crucial moment in anyjudgment improving effort will be the seriousness and   sincerity in quantifyingthe pre-decision perceptions.  This maybe controlled   (to a certain extent) by creating a system of well-designed questionnairesto   the decision makers.    - The Alchemy of Decision_wjk.doc   - The Alchemy of Decision_wjk.doc ",j.kaminski@enron.com,vkaminski@aol.com,(no subject),2001-06-03 14:15:29-07:00,received

"Vince, You may have already thought about this, but I thought it was an interesting way to look at the problem. Jan   June 4, 2001  The Mirage of a Growing Fuel Supply   By EVAR D. NERING   COTTSDALE, Ariz. - When I discussed the exponential function in the first-semester calculus classes that I taught, I invariably used consumption of a nonrenewable natural resource as an example. Since we are now engaged in a national debate about energy policy, it may be useful to talk about the mathematics involved in making a rational decision about resource use.   In my classes, I described the following hypothetical situation. We have a 100-year supply of a resource, say oil - that is, the oil would last 100 years if it were consumed at its current rate. But the oil is consumed at a rate that grows by 5 percent each year. How long would it last under these circumstances? This is an easy calculation; the answer is about 36 years.   Oh, but let's say we underestimated the supply, and we actually have a 1,000-year supply. At the same annual 5 percent growth rate in use, how long will this last? The answer is about 79 years.   Then let us say we make a striking discovery of more oil yet - a bonanza - and we now have a 10,000-year supply. At our same rate of growing use, how long would it last? Answer: 125 years.   Estimates vary for how long currently known oil reserves will last, though they are usually considerably less than 100 years. But the point of this analysis is that it really doesn't matter what the estimates are. There is no way that a supply-side attack on America's energy problem can work.   The exponential function describes the behavior of any quantity whose rate of change is proportional to its size. Compound interest is the most commonly encountered example - it would produce exponential growth if the interest were calculated at a continuing rate. I have heard public statements that use ""exponential"" as though it describes a large or sudden increase. But exponential growth does not have to be large, and it is never sudden. Rather, it is inexorable.   Calculations also show that if consumption of an energy resource is allowed to grow at a steady 5 percent annual rate, a full doubling of the available supply will not be as effective as reducing that growth rate by half - to 2.5 percent. Doubling the size of the oil reserve will add at most 14 years to the life expectancy of the resource if we continue to use it at the currently increasing rate, no matter how large it is currently. On the other hand, halving the growth of consumption will almost double the life expectancy of the supply, no matter what it is.   This mathematical reality seems to have escaped the politicians pushing to solve our energy problem by simply increasing supply. Building more power plants and drilling for more oil is exactly the wrong thing to do, because it will encourage more use. If we want to avoid dire consequences, we need to find the political will to reduce the growth in energy consumption to zero - or even begin to consume less.   I must emphasize that reducing the growth rate is not what most people are talking about now when they advocate conservation; the steps they recommend are just Band-Aids. If we increase the gas mileage of our automobiles and then drive more miles, for example, that will not reduce the growth rate.   Reducing the growth of consumption means living closer to where we work or play. It means telecommuting. It means controlling population growth. It means shifting to renewable energy sources.   It is not, perhaps, necessary to cut our use of oil, but it is essential that we cut the rate of increase at which we consume it. To do otherwise is to leave our descendants in an impoverished world.   Evar D. Nering is professor emeritus of mathematics at Arizona State University.

"Dear Vince:  I hope you have liked the short paper on decision making I sent you a week ago.  It emphasizes the human nature of the process of decision making.  I personally believe that this line of reasoning is systematically neglected by the investment and trading communities.  I think that many of the great traders and investors are very well aware of these limitations of human mind and are making efforts to utilize them.  For example you may encounter similar ideas in the George Soros' book ""The Alchemy of Finance"".  I am certain that developing and expertise in this area bears a tremendous potential for improving  Enron's trading operations and will give us an edge with respect  to other trading powerhouses.   Do you think there are desks at Enron that may be interested in developing a system of procedures that leads to improving our trading performance?  I will be extremely interested in working in this field.  By the way I have already gathered many of  the basic pieces of information needed for such an undertaking.  As a beginning I may make an overview of the literature available on decision biases and list as many of them as possible.  Indeed, the mind traps mentioned in the paper are not the only ones.  Later we may discuss with our clients possibilities for quantifying the influence of a selected group of these biases on the performance of our traders.  Still later, a set of questionnaries, a system for keeping trader's perceptions prior to every act of decion making, and the result of the decision will be created, etc.    I envision the final product to be a self-educating trading system learning from every single experience, both positive and negative and utilizing the history of the decision maker to her best benefit.  After some transition period, the result should be a more enlightened process of decision making of our traders, stripped as much as possible from the common psychological biases and utilizing human judgment--the very thing which differentiates the good trader from the computer (or the bad trader, for that matter).  I will highly appreciate your opinion on these issues.  Thank you in advance.

"Vince, I enjoyed our conversation this afternoon.  I came back to my desk to read this story in the clips -- it says the Front= line show is airing tonight.  I'll dig up TVA for you, Jeannie    June 5, 2001, 1:17AM Houston Chronicle PBS pledge drive alters schedule  By=  MIKE McDANIEL  Copyright 2001 Houston Chronicle TV Editor  Paul Hope, like=  many theater fans, tuned to Channel 8 Sunday night in anticipation of the = first hour of the joint PBS/CBS telecast of the 55th Annual Tony Awards.  W= hat he got instead was a travelog hosted by Rudy Maxa. Because this is pled= ge drive week, Channel 8 did not air the first hour of the three-hour award=  show, as it has in previous years.  ""Channel 8 has made Houston a theatric= al cowtown by this decision,"" Hope, a resident actor at the Alley, said Mon= day.  Alley artistic director Gregory Boyd called the preempting ""absolutel= y indefensible and shocking.""  Fortunately, Channel 8 is being more flexibl= e about a second program that it had originally decided not to air this wee= k.  Frontline, which airs nationally at 9 p.m. tonight, takes a hard look a= t California's energy problems and their direct connection to Houston. The = telecast includes interviews with several Houston players, including Enron'= s Kenneth Lay.  KUHT station manager John Hesse said Channel 8 became aware=  of the Frontline story, titled Blackout, and its Houston connection last w= eek. Because of its local news value, the show will be tape-delayed and air= ed on KUHT at 10 tonight. It will be repeated at 9 p.m. June 12, when Chann= el 8 originally had planned to air the show.  ""When we learned of the local=  significance, we obviously wanted that program to air (here) in a timely m= anner as in the rest of the country,"" Hesse said.  ""We are getting a little=  bit of heat for the Tony thing,"" Hesse said. ""The problem is, it's right i= n the beginning of our pledge evening. We had a schedule in place, and a de= cision was made to stick to that schedule because that was our opportunity = for fund raising.""  Fund drives are vital to keep the station operating and=  to purchase quality programming.  ""When we're scheduling our pledge dates,=  we try to coordinate the normal PBS schedule with what we determine will d= o the best for us in terms of fund raising,"" Hesse said. ""We only use about=  2 percent of our air time a year in fund-raising efforts, and when we're u= sing that 2 percent, we have to make the most of them.""  That's no comfort = to the folks who were hoping to experience what turned out to be theatrical=  history being made. Mel Brooks' The Producers -- not only the talk of Broa= dway but also the entertainment world -- won a record 12 Tonys Sunday night= .  Most were awarded in the show's first hour -- where Tonys for director, = choreographer and other categories are handed out. To diehards, the PBS por= tion of the Tonys exceeds CBS' in that it airs without commercials and incl= udes behind-the-scenes interviews with directors, composers, designers and = others.  Hesse explained that Channel 8's pledge-drive dates were set befor= e the station knew whether PBS would even have the Tonys.  The first hour o= f Sunday's show had direct links to theater talents whose work has been see= n and heralded in Houston.  David Woolard, nominated for best costume desig= n for The Rocky Horror Show, is costume designer of The Carpetbagger's Chil= dren, which opens Wednesday at the Alley.  Doug Besterman, a winner Sunday = for his orchestrations for The Producers, has done the same for the Frank (= Jekyll and Hyde) Wildhorn productions that have played here.  Doug Schmidt,=  a nominee in the scenic design category for 42nd Street, was a designer fo= r the Alley's Civil War and A Christmas Carol.  Hesse said, ""We knew by the=  end of March"" that PBS would co-host Sunday's show, and yet ""the decision = was made to stick with the schedule in place.""  Because the Tonys isn't ""ow= ned"" by PBS, it could not be used as a pledge show, although Hesse conceded=  pledges could have been sought before and after.  ""There's nothing against=  the `rules,' "" he said. ""It's just been our normal method of operation her= e (to run the pledge drive at 7 p.m.) in terms of our prime-time evening pl= edge start.""  In a related development, NBC affiliate KPRC will not be show= ing the first episode of a new comedy series bowing tonight. Kristin, starr= ing Kristin Chenoweth, is being pre-empted by Road to Redemption, a movie f= unded by the Billy Graham Crusade.  Channel 2 made a decision in March to r= un the movie 7-8:30 tonight, KPRC general manager Steve Wasserman said. NBC=  has scheduled the premiere of Kristin for 7:30 p.m. and is not allowing it=  to air later in prime time, he said. =09 ",j.kaminski@enron.com,mandelker@enron.com,Frontline IS airing tonight,2001-06-05 14:49:16-07:00,received

"Thanks Vince... We'll be auctioning off transmission rights in these corridors in September (assuming FERC approves our filing), which confronts traders with a complex array of valuation problems (the long-term value of the right to ship energy along these DC pathways and to collect ancillary services in each of the markets). It's a conceptually difficult challenge for most companies but I'm sure Enron is all over it. We'll be interested in whether or not Enron's traders participate in this auction.  We are also pre-selling some of the capacity in negotiations over the summer, in the expectation of FERC approval of that concept (kind of an anchor tenant concept).  As you will recall, we did approach Enron early on in the project (a fellow in Calgary whose name I cannot remember) and he indicated no interest. I'll keep you in the loop because I suspect you'll find the intellectual challenge intriguing -- what is access to DC capacity worth? --- as I do.  Hope things are going well in all of your markets!

""The meeting has spilled o= ver to the second day with DPC to participate in the proceedings on Wednesd= ay,"" financial institutions sources said. The sources said Enron India mana= ging director K Wade Cline and DPC president Neil McGregor were likely to p= articipate in the second day of the meeting. They said the meeting, which w= ent on for over an hour, discussed the ongoing financial and legal disputes=  between DPC and the Maharashtra State Electricity Board. ""Nothing has been=  finalised as yet,"" they said when asked whether both the Indian and foreig= n lenders were able to arrive at any solution for solving the current statu= s quo. At the Singapore meet, the lenders have come together to try and dif= fuse the tension and unite the two ""warring partners"" - DPC and MSEB.=20  The foreign lenders were expected to be updated by their Indian counterpart= s about developments like DPC's preliminary termination notice to MSEB, whi= ch in retaliation rescinded the PPA and stopped drawing power from the mult= inational from May 29. The Indian lenders would press for completion of the=  $3-billion project, as DPC has stopped commercial production and doubts ar= e being expressed for commissioning of its 1,444-mw phase-II, due on Thursd= ay. The Indian team is led by Industrial Development Bank of India executiv= e director R S Agarwal, who is also DPC board member, along with representa= tives of State Bank of India and ICICI. The foreign lenders include a conso= rtium led by ABN-Amro, Citibank NA, Japan Exim Bank and Opic. (PTI)  --------------------------------------------------------------------------= ---------------------------------------------------------------------------= ---------------------------------------- THE TIMES OF INDIA, Wednesday, June 06, 2001=20 Lenders split over DPC transfer notice to MSEB ,  Pradipta Bagchi=20 Lenders to the $ 2.9-billion Dabhol Power Company are split over whether DP= C should be allowed to issue a transfer notice to MSEB. Last Friday, Enron = sought the lenders' permission--for the second time in a month--to issue a = transfer notice to MSEB. A transfer notice allows the valuation of all fixe= d assets to begin with and is the first step in starting the process of tra= nsfer of assets to the MSEB. While domestic lenders like IDBI, ICICI and SB= I--with an exposure of more than Rs 5,000 crore to the project--are opposin= g the move to issue a transfer notice, most foreign lenders including the l= ead arrangers to the project are now agreeable to the transfer notice being=  issued by the DPC. On the first day of lenders' deliberations in Singapore= , vast differences emerged between the domestic and foreign lenders in this=  regard.=20 While domestic lenders are worried about the impact of the huge exposure on=  their balance sheets, foreign lenders, who typically have smaller exposure= , are of the opinion that without any alternative concrete solutions, it ma= y be worthwhile to pull the plug on the project. ``Without any concrete sol= utions and no fixed time-frame, foreign lenders are not willing to go to th= eir respective credit committees for further disbursals,'' a lender from Si= ngapore told The Times of India. ``There is no point throwing more good mon= ey after bad, is the consensus among foreign lenders,'' said the lender.=20 Among other issues discussed on the first day of the meetings was whether t= he lenders should throw Enron out of the project and take over the operatio= ns of DPC. However, without a proper team of skilled managers in place, it = is unlikely that the lenders will risk throwing out the current operators. = Fresh disbursals from the lenders are unlikely. Among the first casualties = will be an Enron affiliate company, which is the EPC contractor for the LNG=  terminal. On June 8, a payment of $ 13 million is to be made to the LNG co= ntractor, which will not be disbursed by the lenders. Another big payment o= f $ 25 million has to be made to Bechtel, the EPC contractor for the power = plant, by June 18 as well.=20 Enron and DPC officials will make a presentation on Wednesday to the banker= s, following which, further deliberations will be held among the lending ba= nks.  --------------------------------------------------------------------------= ---------------------------------------------------------------------------= ---------------------------------------- THE INDIAN EXPRESS, Wednesday, June 06, 2001=20 DPC lenders meet opens on a positive note  The first day of the crucial meeting between the Indian and international l= enders in Singapore has opened on a positive note with the foreign lenders = showing signs of giving more time to Indian government to resolve the probl= em.=20  Foreign lenders are enthused by the fact that the Centre is ready to give i= ncentives to the project so that DPC can reduce its tariff. The Centre' pac= kage include cutting interest rate on the project, and asking the Central E= lectricity Authority (CEA) to work out a contingency plan for sale of power=  to other States from the Dabhol power project.''The international lenders = are ready to give some more time to find out a solution. Lenders will take = the maximum hit if the Enron pulls the plug into the project,'' FI sources = said. Hence, the rethinking among the international lenders. The Centre's p= ackage, to be ready in another two months, would also lower the customs dut= y on imported LNG which would further help the company to lower the tariff.  Enron India managing director K Wade Cline and DPC president Neil McGregor = are likely to participate in the second day of the meeting on Wednesday to = present their side of the story. Tuesday's meeting, which went on for over = an hour, discussed the on-going financial and legal disputes between DPC an= d its partner Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB).At the meet, the l= enders have come together to try and diffuse escalated tension and unite th= e two warring partners, DPC and MSEB, say FI sources.=20  While loans from international FIs enjoy the Indian government guarantee, i= t would be Indian FIs which will have to take the maximum hit if the projec= t gets derailed. On Tuesday, the foreign lenders were updated by the Indian=  counterparts over series of events like DPC's Preliminary Termination Noti= ce to MSEB, which in retaliation rescinded the PPA and stopped drawing powe= r from the multinational from May 29. The Indian team is led by Industrial = Development Bank of India (IDBI) executive director R S Agarwal, who is als= o DPC board member, along with representatives of State Bank of India and I= CICI. The foreign lenders include a consortium led by ABN-Amro, Citibank NA= , Japan Exim bank and OPIC.=20  Sanjay Jog=20  The Central Electricity Authority (CEA) has launched an exercise to assess=  the viability of despatch of Dabhol power to various power deficit states = across the country, announced the Union minister of state for power Jayavan= tiben on Tuesday. Mehta said that the CEA, which has been asked to undertak= e this exercise recently, will take into account the burden to be borne by = various power deficit states during the despatch of power. Currently, if th= e power has to be transported from eastern grid to western grid, there is c= ertain fixed charge imposed on it. ""The CEA will have to carry out this exe= rcise at length so that the exact picture will emerge whether or not the Da= bhol power despatch is viable and whether the states are keen to purchase t= hat power,"" the minister added. Mehta said that the centre will not purchas= e Dabhol power as its undertakings cannot take the additional burden on the= m. She informed that the union finance ministry in no uncertain terms made = it clear that the centre cannot purchase Dabhol power and sell it at cheape= r rate to the states especially when these states owe over Rs 30,000 crore = to various central public sector undertakings. Mehta said that prime minist= er AB Vajpayee who has been apprised him of the present situation on the Da= bhol front has assured to provide necessary assistance especially technical=  one to resolve the issue.  --------------------------------------------------------------------------= ---------------------------------------------------------------------------= ---------------------------------------- THE FINANCIAL EXPRESS, Wednesday, June 06, 2001 DPC lenders to resume talks today in Singapore=20   THE two-day talks to resolve Dabhol tangle opened on a positive note in Si= ngapore on Tuesday.Sources in Indian financial institutions (IFIs) told The=  Financial Express that the IFIs comprising representatives of IDBI, ICICI,=  State Bank of India (SBI) met to chalk out their strategy at the two-day m= eeting with offshore lenders and Enron officials. The Indian team was lead = by Mr RS Agarwal, IDBI executive director, along with the other officials f= rom other lending institutions including those from the SBI and ICICI.Appar= ently, the IFIs, on Tuesday revived their efforts to convince DPC's offshor= e lenders to maintain ""restraint"" to save the Dabhol project. The meeting b= etween the IFIs and their foreign counterparts remained inconclussive on Tu= esday. The foreign lenders are expected to take a clear stand on Wednesday.  Interestingly, the meeting is expected to be participated by members of the=  DPC on the second day, said financial institutions sources. The sources sa= id, Enron India managing director K Wade Cline and DPC president Neil McGre= gor are likely to participate in the second day of the meeting. The meeting=  was also attended by a consortium led by ABN-Amro, Citibank NA, Japan Exim=  Bank and OPIC. According to sources in IDBI: ""The foreign lenders have giv= en us a patient hearing to our views suggesting that they should not precip= itate the crisis by any of their further moves."" The sources said the IFIs = are determined to take up the issue of completion of the Dabhol phase-II in=  view of 90 per cent of its completion. ""The IDBI has recieved a mandate fr= om the government that an all-out effort be made to save the Dabhol project= ,"" the sources added.  The offshore lenders are believed to have sought various details with refer= ence to the payment guarantees from the Maharashtra State Electricity Board=  (MSEB) as well as fulfilment of contractual obligations in the wake of rev= oking of the power purchase agreement. The IFIs are likely to press for the=  revocation of suspension of loan disbursement by offshore lenders so that = phase-II be completed. The offshore lenders had suspended loan disbursement=  after the DPC board meeting of London on April 25.=20  --------------------------------------------------------------------------= ---------------------------------------------------------------------------= ---------------------------------------- BUSINESS STANDARD, Wednesday, June 06, 2001 MSEB refuses DPC power at 90% PLF, Renni Abraham  The Maharashtra government will not buy power from the first phase of the = Dabhol Power Company's (DPC) project at a 90 per cent plant load factor (PL= F), a senior state government official said here today. The statement repre= sents a hardening of Maharashtra's position on talks with DPC and virtually=  kills the latter's proposal to split tariffs for the Centre and Maharashtr= a. The Maharashtra State Electri- city Board (MSEB) is now required to buy = 90 per cent of the power generated by the first phase (740 mw) of the proje= ct. But during negotiations with the Godbole Committee, it has been demandi= ng that the requirement be cut to 35 per cent. At the last Godbole Committe= e meeting, DPC had put forward a plan to split tariffs for the Centre and M= aharashtra, with the Centre paying Rs 3.30 per unit of power and MSEB payin= g Rs 3.50.=20 The Centre, DPC suggested, could buy two-thirds of the power it generated, = once the second phase (1,444 mw, taking the total capacity to 2,184 mw) was=  completed. Maharashtra's latest position undermines DPC's proposal since t= he Enron-promoted company's tariff hinges on MSEB absorbing 90 per cent of = the power it generates in the first phase. A senior state government offici= al said: ""The Centre has been talking a lot about playing the role of a fac= ilitator. What we need is a buyer for the second phase."" Despite recent cen= tral government pronouncements, state government officials privately argue = that the Centre is not playing an active role in resolving the problems tha= t have plagued the DPC project. At the very first Godbole Committee meeting=  he attended, the Centre's nominee, AV Gokak, adopted a non-committal stand= . The Maharashtra government official added: ""Gokak said he was merely atte= nding the meeting in the capacity of a messenger and would communicate to t= he Centre any solution worked out by the renegotiation committee. The Union=  power ministry has stated that a solution worked out by the renegotiation = committee would be acceptable to it. Unless the Centre takes an active part=  and assures the offtake of the second phase, no solution can be worked out= .""  --------------------------------------------------------------------------= ---------------------------------------------------------------------------= ---------------------------------------- THE HINDU BUSINESSLINE, Wednesday, June 06, 2001=20 Dabhol says ready to extend conciliation , Shaji Vikraman , Balaji C. Mouli= =20  THE Dabhol Power Company (DPC) has accepted the Finance Ministry's proposal=  for a two months' extension for the conciliation process. The extension wi= ll be effective from June 7. This development is perceived by the Governmen= t as a positive signal as it offers more leeway to work out a solution to r= esolve the Dabhol crisis. DPC's nod for an extension, which was communicate= d to the Finance Secretary on Monday, is subject to the Government acceding=  to the company's stand on the ongoing arbitration proceedings. The company=  has said that it would continue to pursue the arbitration proceedings whic= h have already been initiated by the company, according to senior Ministry = officials. Under the power purchase agreement (PPA), conciliation and arbit= ration are two methods under the contract to resolve disputes between the t= wo parties. Normally, arbitration is resorted to only after conciliation fa= ils. However, in this case, DPC has dragged MSEB to the arbitration forum e= ven as the conciliation process is being pursued.=20  DPC has already slapped three arbitration notices on the Maharashtra State = Electricity Board (MSEB). The first notice was issued to the board for its = failure to honour the December 2000 bill of Rs 102 crore and the January 20= 01 bill of Rs 111.6 crore while two other notices were for failures to hono= ur the Maharashtra Government's State support agreement and the supplementa= ry State support agreement. The conciliation process was adopted in the wak= e of the dispute arising over the settlement of DPC's December bills of Rs = 102 crore, followed by the MSEB's counter claim of Rs 400 crore for the sam= e period.=20  The conciliation process was agreed upon on April 7 and was to be concluded=  in two months. However, simultaneously, arbitration proceedings were trigg= ered between DPC and MSEB. With the conciliation process making little head= way, the Finance Ministry sought an additional two months time for concludi= ng the process. Prior to that, the Attorney General's interpretation of the=  MSEB-DPC contract was that the payment could be made to DPC only if the bi= ll was undisputed. Hence, the Centre decided to opt for the conciliation pr= ocess.=20  During recent meetings between the Government and the DPC officials, the la= tter had pointed out that if the Government was able to work out a package = in six months, it would withdraw its termination notice and reamin in the p= roject for up to a year. The Finance Ministry officials feel that the Centr= e has been dragged into the DPC controversy well beyond its contractual obl= igation. ``The Centre's involvement in DPC-MSEB issue is restricted to the = first phase. The fate of the second phase is entirely a matter between the = MSEB and DPC,''they said.=20  Analysts feel that the Power Minister, Mr Suresh Prabhu's words of hope to = defuse the Dabhol crisis are not grounded in reality. ``The Centre is totti= ng sale of Dabhol power to third-party as a key solution. However, first, u= nder the existing electricity laws, the Centre cannot authorise third-party=  sale since it is in the State's domain. Secondly, since it is a purely com= mercial decision, the Central Electricity Authority's (CEA) intervention do= es not offer any significant breakthrough.'' Recently, the Power Ministry h= ad instructed the CEA to survey the demand requirement of neighbouring Stat= es over the next two years as well as their purchase price.=20  --------------------------------------------------------------------------= ---------------------------------------------------------------------------= ---------------------------------------- THE HINDU BUSINESSLINE, Wednesday, June 06, 2001=20 MSEB unruffled amid power talk , Dinesh Narayanan=20  EVEN as officials from various financial institutions and banks split hairs=  in Singapore on whether to sink or sail with the Dabhol power project, the=  Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB) is cool about the entire affair= . Unlike previous instances when the odds were stacked against it, this tim= e MSEB knows pretty well that whatever happens, it will remain unscathed. I= f someone has to take a hit, it has to be the financiers and maybe the Gove= rnments.At the hearing before the Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Author= ity (MERC), the Advocate-General, Mr Goolam Vahanvati, had said on behalf o= f the board that MSEB was being kind towards Enron when it rescinded the co= ntract for ``material misrepresentation''. One more step, and it's fraud, h= e had told MERC.=20  Knowing this fully well, MSEB has kept its cool throughout the altercation.=  It firmly believes that if nothing else, it can pin down the company on ju= st this one point at any forum. Enron too has not said at any point of time=  that it can actually perform as per the ``cold-start graph'' in the power = purchase agreement. In fact, it has said such performance -- making availab= le full power in 180 minutes -- is ``not possible'' by any such plant in th= e world. In a way, it was MSEB's defiant posturing coupled with the Maharas= htra Government's passing the buck up that got the Central Government to ac= t.=20  One thing evident throughout the crisis is that all the players are trying = to save their own skin. In spite of the developments, Enron has played its = cards close to its chest, and hinted to institutions at taking a hit on its=  returns only a few days ago. Even that, Mr Wade Cline, Managing Director, = Enron India Pvt Ltd, is reported to have told Indian lenders, would hinge o= n substantial give and take. Indian lenders have a genuine case in that the= y are the ones without any assurances apart from the plant itself. And, the= y are not in the business of running power plants. They cannot do much exce= pt try get the players to somehow shake hands. They had tried to convince t= he Government some time ago to get MSEB to activate the escrow and increase=  the letter of credit amount. But they were told off by MSEB which was in n= o mood to relent. Today's meeting in Singapore remained inconclusive and th= e talks will continue tomorrow. Tomorrow, Enron will make presentations to = lenders at Singapore on what it feels can be done to move ahead. Whatever t= he outcome of the meeting, MSEB is unlikely to agree to anything that might=  queer its pitch.=20  --------------------------------------------------------------------------= ---------------------------------------------------------------------------= ---------------------------------------- THE FINANCIAL EXPRESS, Wednesday, June 06, 2001=20 CEA to assess viability of Dabhol power despatch to various states' ,   San= jay Jog  THE Central Electricity Authority (CEA) has launched an exercise to assess = the viability of the despatch of Dabhol power to various power deficit stat= es across the country, Union  minister of state for power Jayavantiben Meht= a on Tuesday. Ms Mehta told The Financial Express that the CEA, which has b= een asked to undertake this exercise recently, will take into account the b= urden to be borne by various power deficit states during the despatch of po= wer. Currently, if the power has to be transported from eastern grid to wes= tern grid, there is a certain fixed charge imposed on it. ""The CEA will hav= e to carry out this exercise at length so that the exact picture will emerg= e whether or not the Dabhol power despatch is viable and whether the states=  are keen to purchase that power,"" the minister added. Ms Mehta said that t= he Centre will not purchase Dabhol power as its undertakings cannot take th= e additional burden on them.=20  She informed that the Union finance ministry had in no uncertain terms made=  it clear that the Centre cannot purchase Dabhol power and sell it at cheap= er rate to the states, especially when these states owe over Rs 30,000 cror= e to various Central public sector undertakings. Ms Mehta said that Prime M= inister Atal Behari Vajpayee, who has been apprised of the present situatio= n on the Dabhol front, has assured that he would provide necessary assistan= ce, especially technical, to resolve the issue. ""The Centre is quite eager = for the resolution of issue and will provide necessary cooperation,"" she ad= ded.  Ms Mehta said that she had a meeting with the representatives of the Bank o= f America and ABN Amro before they left for the Singapore meeting. ""These l= enders explained their position and the amount involved in the Dabhol plant= . However, they also expressed their wish to participate in finding an acce= ptable wayout,"" she added.  --------------------------------------------------------------------------= ---------------------------------------------------------------------------= ---------------------------------------- THE ASIAN AGE, Wednesday, June 06, 2001 Gujarat, Up High on Power Reforms, By Rajesh Unnikrishnan  Uttar Pradesh, Delhi and Gujarat are moving ahead with implementing reforms=  in the power sector, even as the reforms in Maharashtra have come to a sta= ndstill due to the Dabhol fiasco. Maharashtra was one of the first states t= o initiate steps for reforms phase-II, by appointing a state regulatory com= mission and going in for unbundling MSEB. Uttar Pradesh State Electricity B= oard and Delhi Vidyut Board are finalising plans to privatise transmission = and distribution, while Gujarat is planning to set up one more power projec= t with private sector participation.=20  According to State Bank of India Capital Markets officials, UPSEB is going = to float a new tender, inviting private sector players for power supply in = Kanpur region. Due to employees' protests against the privatisation, the st= ate electricity board had cancelled its earlier tender floated in 2000.  SB= I Caps had also short-listed four companies: L&T, CESC, BSES and Tata Power=  for transmission and distribution in Kanpur. The officials said: ""UPSEB wi= ll come out with a new tariff order for Kanpur by this week end and a new t= ender will be floated by month-end. We would undertake the short-listing pr= ocess by mid-July.""They said that besides this, the UP State Industrial Dev= elopment Corporation is also setting up a 30 MW captive power project for t= he newly-developed industrial park, Tronica City, in the state. Total cost = of the project is estimated at Rs 100 crores and BHEL is the equipment supp= lier for the project.  SBI Caps short-listed six private players for supplying power in three regi= ons Tata Power, BSES, Reliance Power, China Light&Power, AES, the AV Birla = Group and CESC. Two months back, the Delhi government had cleared State Ban= k of India Caps' proposal for the unbundling of DVB by dividing the board i= nto five separate units. The proposal envisaged three transmission and dist= ribution companies and two generation companies. DVB makes losses to the tu= ne of Rs 1 crore per day. Officials said the Gujarat, on the other hand, is=  focussed more on generation and the state electricity board recently propo= sed a 500 MW project in Mundra and invited a proposal from the private sect= or.  The project will use imported coal as fuel and the state will keep a minimu= m equity in it. There are two independent power projects in Gujarat: the Re= liance-promoted, 500 MW, naphtha-based Hazira project and the 500 MW, gas-b= ased project promoted by Gujarat Power Corporation. According to the offici= als, the unbundling of Gujarat SEB has failed to take off because the state=  government has not yet appointed any merchant banker for it. The governmen= t initiated the state electricity board unbundling around two years back.   <Embedded Picture (Metafile)> <Embedded Picture (Metafile)> <Embedded Picture (Metafile)> <Embedded Picture (Metafile)> <Embedded Picture (Metafile)> <Embedded Picture (Metafile)> <Embedded Picture (Metafile)> <Embedded Picture (Metafile)> <Embedded Picture (Metafile)> <Embedded Picture (Metafile)> <Embedded Picture (Metafile)>",j.kaminski@enron.com,kohli@enron.com,FW: From The Enron India Newsdesk - June 6th newsclips,2001-06-06 06:02:47-07:00,received

We'll be auctioning off transmission rights in these corridors in September (assuming FERC approves our filing), which confronts traders with a complex array of valuation problems (the long-term value of the right to ship energy along these DC pathways and to collect ancillary services in each of the markets). It's a conceptually difficult challenge for most companies but I'm sure Enron is all over it. We'll be interested in whether or not Enron's traders participate in this auction.

The link is embedded in one of the messages below.  The Neptune Regional Electrical Transmission System will connect rapidly growing, electric-load centers in New York City, downtown Boston, and the Connecticut and New Jersey shores with clean and efficient electric generating facilities in Eastern Canada and Maine.  Employing state of the art, environmentally proven sub-sea cable technology, the Neptune System will overcome constraints to the existing land-based electric transmission grid which hinder the efficient use of energy resources along the Mid and North Atlantic seaboard.

We'll be auctioning off transmission rights in these corridors in September (assuming FERC approves our filing), which confronts traders with a complex array of valuation problems (the long-term value of the right to ship energy along these DC pathways and to collect ancillary services in each of the markets). It's a conceptually difficult challenge for most companies but I'm sure Enron is all over it. We'll be interested in whether or not Enron's traders participate in this auction.  We are also pre-selling some of the capacity in negotiations over the summer, in the expectation of FERC approval of that concept (kind of an anchor tenant concept).  As you will recall, we did approach Enron early on in the project (a fellow in Calgary whose name I cannot remember) and he indicated no interest. I'll keep you in the loop because I suspect you'll find the intellectual challenge intriguing -- what is access to DC capacity worth? --- as I do.  Hope things are going well in all of your markets!

He will make sure that we do not request FX and inflation (CPI,PPI, etc.) curves when only one of the curves will actually be used in the valuation process and to determine which inflation index is needed.  Typically, we receive both FX and inflation from you, but both curves may not always be used.  I hope that we can give you some time savings by eliminating any nonessential requests.  For now, this is the list of countries for which  we will  probably need the FX and/or inflation curves.  I will send the specifics per Andre later today.  India  Philippines Bolivia Jamaica Guatemala Venezuela Columbia Puerto Rico CPI only (I need historical inflation data, as well) Panama Brazil  we have current data already China  we have current data already Euro  inflation only  I am not certain about the needs for the London Underwriting/IV group but will request the information from them if you have not done so already.

Participation and interest by Enron employees has exceeded expectations and many classes were quickly filled.  As a result, repeat classes have been offered and new sessions have been added to the program.  In addition to the Lexis-Nexis and Dow Jones classes, eSource has now begun hosting sessions on Piranha (financials and pricing information), Investext (analyst reports and market analysis), Global Access (financials and corporate activity), and Securities Data Corp. (M&A, debt).   eSource has also arranged long distance sessions using interactive web tools for Enron employees around the world.  Watch for e-mails announcing new training sessions, either in Houston or in a virtual desktop mode.  Since our launch in December, the eSearch website has received over 230,000 hits.  The site today offers Enron employees access to 34 electronic databases.  These databases offer the latest financial and business on-line research capabilities in a cost-effective manner.  In this era of information explosion, databases are constantly being reviewed to ensure that Enron's research needs are being met.  If you know of a professionally relevant database that might be added to eSearch, let us know.  Meanwhile, to further fulfill Enron's research needs, eSource is arranging for desktop access to good-old-fashioned libraries too.  Books from public and local university libraries can be located, borrowed and delivered to employees' desks.  This should be particularly helpful for those with more specialized or technical research needs.   We are also proud to report that at a recent local research conference, Enron's eSource was featured as an industry trailblazer for having invented itself into a combined virtual library and intranet-based research center capable of delivering a broad range of research products and services via the user's desktop.  Attendees from Reliant, Shell, Halliburton and ExxonMobil and others were duly impressed.    As for the future, watch for Version 2.0 of the eSearch website, http://esource.enron.com, scheduled to launch soon.  It will feature greater functionality and additional content.  Look for new features like ""Industry Overviews"" and links to information providers like Frost & Sullivan, Country Watch, and World Energy Markets.   IN THE NEWS  Chicago And Its Suburbs Pick Enron, ComEd For Power Deals 06/06/2001  Dow Jones Energy Service (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) CHICAGO -(Dow Jones)-The City of Chicago and 47 suburban communities have decided to divide new deals for 400 megawatts of power between Enron Corp. (ENE) and local utility Commonwealth Edison Co., Chicago officials said Wednesday.  In the largest power purchase agreement in Illinois since the state choose to deregulate the industry in 1997, the local government groups will get 60% of their power from Enron and 40% from Exelon Corp.'s (EXC) ComEd. The municipalities use the power for public buildings and public transportation. Chicago announced Monday that the group has picked ComEd to meet the renewable target by providing 80 megawatts of power created with landfill gas, wind and other sources. ComEd will also provide the coalition with another 80 megawatts of power generated with fossil fuel and nuclear plants, and Enron will provide the other 240 megawatts. The new contracts are expected to go into effect this year.  ""We used our purchasing power as local governments to get the best price we could and at the same time to promote competition in Illinois. Enron gave us the most competitive price,""  Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley said at a press conference.

Your son looks like he may have background in those    specific       frameworks, but I couldn't be entirely sure. We have integration    needs       in a       few proprietary interfaces also, so a general capacity to learn new       interfaces quickly is a priority for us.  I'll get our job    descriptions       and       forward them to you.  Additionally, we do our risk analytics in       Mathematica       (for the time being), but we have a full team.

I have not reviewed the details or the (one-RAC) structure with any of the other RAC or risk management functions - please do not distribute yourselves as I'd like to ""cushion"" the reception.

As I turn around the next draft, I'll work on a power point presentation for use in the executive meetings beginning the last week of June (Business Unit Offices of the Chairman, Whalley, Causey, Fastow, Skilling).

The plan would fall short of the price caps. But= , expanding the existing formula for price limits has picked up support amo= ng Republicans who are under increasing pressure. FERC Chairman Hebert has = called a special commission hearing for Monday to address the continuing is= sues affecting California and the West. The proposal seeks to have FERC set=  target prices for wholesale electricity prices on an around-the-clock basi= s for the entire West. Under the existing plan, the FERC price limits are t= riggered when the state declares a power emergency and are based on the amo= unt that generators can charge to produce power at the least efficient plan= t. Hebert says that since the FERC relief plan went into effect on May 29th= , power prices in California have dropped to under $100 per MWh from earlie= r in May over the $300 per MWh.

Dominion would be responsible for the construction, ownership and operat= ion of the proposed facility, which will utilize state-of-the-art clean coa= l technology and would burn more than 65% coal waste. Anker would provide a= ll of the facility's fuel from on-site surface mining operations. This prop= osed coal-fired plant is the first Dominion has developed since payingt $1.= 2 billion to the EPA last November for Clean Air Act violations pertaining = to its coal-fired facilities. The proposed facility will be developed with = NOx reducing equipment built-in. Also, the plant will utilize circulating f= luidized bed boilers, technology that allows coal to be burned more efficie= ntly. The CFB boilers can also burn low heat-content coal and waste fuel, s= omething traditional burners cannot. All coal and coal waste produced will = be burned on-site.

Citing FERC's investigation into gas pri= ces at the California border, APGA said it is concerned not only about that=  point, but also that market power gained through the unregulated control o= f pipeline capacity will lead to unjust and unreasonable prices for natural=  gas service throughout the US.

According to a number of computer security types, a purported video of the McVeigh execution circulating the 'Net is actually a virus that drops the SubSeven backdoor onto infected systems.  For those who don't know, SubSeven can be used to take over control of the infected machine and be used in distributed denial-of-service attacks. The good news is that most updated antivirus scanners already detect this virus, so if your systems are up to date, you should be safe.  For more on this, check out this wire story posted on DigitalMass.com: http://digitalmass.boston.com/news/2001/06/14/mcveigh_virus.html   Today's bug patches and security alerts:   * SQL security hole lets attackers take over  A security flaw in Microsoft's SQL Server 7.0 and SQL Server 2000 Gold can allow an attacker to take control of a targeted server, the company said in a security bulletin late Tuesday night. Microsoft issued a patch for the flaw at the same time it released the bulletin. http://www.nwfusion.com/news/2001/0613sqlhole.html IDG News Service, 06/13/01  For a patch and more information from Microsoft: http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/MS01-032.asp   * Microsoft has third go at Exchange hole  Microsoft has issued a third version of a patch intended to plug a security hole that could allow hackers access to mailboxes on Exchange Server Versions 5.5 and 2000. The second patch contained outdated files, Microsoft said in an updated security bulletin issued Wednesday. http://www.nwfusion.com/news/2001/0614exchangehole.html IDG News Service, 06/14/01  For a third try at getting the correct patch, click to: http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/MS01-030.asp   * HP warns of potential DoS vulnerability in kmmodreg  Hewlett-Packard is warning its HP-UX operating system users of a potential denial-of-service vulnerability in the kmmodreg command, which is executed each time the system is booted. The problem with the package also could be used to increase privileges on the affected system. HP-UX users can download a patch for the kmmodreg problem by logging on to HP's IT Resource Center at: http://itrc.hp.com   * Xinetd patch released by Linux OS vendors  Many Linux vendors have released a patch for the xinetd package that fixes a flaw in the way the application deals with TCP WAIT commands. The problem prevents the linuxconf-web application from working properly. Another flaw in the xinetd package creates world-writeable files that can be used in a symlink attack. Linux-Mandrake users can download the new patch from: http://www.linux-mandrake.com/en/ftp.php3  Red Hat users can get more information and links to patches from: http://www.redhat.com/support/errata/RHSA-2001-075.html  Immunix OS 7.0-beta and 7.0 users can get the appropriate patch from: http://download.immunix.org/ImmunixOS/7.0/updates/RPMS/xinetd-2.1.8.9pre15-2  _imnx.i386.rpm   * Linux-Mandrake patches tcpdump  Linux-Mandrake has issued a patch for its tcpdump package that fixes a potential buffer overflow vulnerability. The flaw could be used in a remote attack on the tcpdump process. This patch also fixes a previous vulnerability that could allow a remote user to run arbitrary code on the affected system without root privileges. The new patch can be downloaded from: http://www.linux-mandrake.com/en/ftp.php3   * Linux-Mandrake fixes imap flaw  According to an alert from Linux-Mandrake, several flaws have been found in the UW-IMAP package that could allow an authenticated user to gain greater shell command access. This is particularly problematic for e-mail systems that do not normally provide shell access. Patches can be downloaded from: http://www.linux-mandrake.com/en/ftp.php3   * Conectiva patches exim  A printf vulnerability exists in exim, a mail transfer utility. The flaw in the code deals with the way exim check e-mail headers without protecting against a printf format attack. Conectiva users can download the appropriate patch from: ftp://atualizacoes.conectiva.com.br/6.0/SRPMS/exim-3.16-4U60_1cl.src.rpm ftp://atualizacoes.conectiva.com.br/6.0/RPMS/exim-3.16-4U60_1cl.i386.rpm ftp://atualizacoes.conectiva.com.br/6.0/RPMS/exim-doc-3.16-4U60_1cl.i386.rpm  ftp://atualizacoes.conectiva.com.br/6.0/RPMS/exim-mon-3.16-4U60_1cl.i386.rpm    * Red Hat issues patch for ispell  According to an alert from Red Hat, the ispell program uses mktemp() to open temporary files, which makes it vulnerable to symlink attacks. For more information and to download a patch: http://www.redhat.com/support/errata/RHSA-2001-074.html   * GnuPG patch available for Red Hat Linux users  GnuPG, an open source version of PGP, contains a number of flaws that could leave a user's private key exposed. The problem is a format string vulnerability in GnuPG's code. For more information and links to the appropriate download: http://www.redhat.com/support/errata/RHSA-2001-073.html   * Red Hat: LPRng fails to drop supplemental group membership  According to an alert from Red Hat, LPRng fails to drop supplemental group membership at init time, though it does properly setuid and setgid. The result is that LPRng, and its children, maintain any supplemental groups that the process starting LPRng had at the time it started LPRng. This is a security risk. Download the appropriate patch from:  Red Hat Linux 7.0: alpha: ftp://updates.redhat.com/7.0/en/os/alpha/LPRng-3.7.4-23.alpha.rpm i386: ftp://updates.redhat.com/7.0/en/os/i386/LPRng-3.7.4-23.i386.rpm  Red Hat Linux 7.1: i386: ftp://updates.redhat.com/7.1/en/os/i386/LPRng-3.7.4-23.i386.rpm   * ScreamingMedia patches SiteWare vulnerability  A flaw in ScreamingMedia's SiteWare Web server could allow a user to view all documents in the SiteWare Web hierarchy. A similar problem could allow any file to be retrieved from the system. More information and a patch can be found at: http://www01.screamingmedia.com/en/security/sms1001.php   Today's round up of virus alerts:   * Simpsons worm hits Macs  When the Mac vs. PC wars start up, as they inevitably do, on Usenet or Web message boards or just around the office, Mac partisans always tout the dearth of viruses for their chosen computer as one of the main benefits in adopting Apple's operating system. And though, technically, there still may not be very many viruses for the Mac, a new Mac e-mail worm has recently been discovered and is making its way across iMacs and Powerbooks everywhere. http://www.nwfusion.com/news/2001/0611simpsons.html IDG News Service, 06/11/01   * Virus hoax warns people to delete AOL  Perhaps the greatest thrill for any prankster is to have his hoax taken as truth. Just such a thing has happened to Ray Owens, who runs a Web site called Joke A Day. Owens sent an e- mail to the 342,000 of his subscribers on June 5 (after an initial mailing on June 2 to another list) warning them of a new virus, called AOL.EXE. Warning your customers of a virus seems like a nice thing to do, except that AOL.EXE isn't a virus at all; it's the AOL application that provides Internet access to millions of people worldwide. http://www.nwfusion.com/net.worker/news/2001/0611aolhoax.html IDG News Service, 06/11/01  * WM97/Myna-AR - A Word macro virus with no malicious payload. (Sophos)  * XM97/Laroux-OC - This Excel macro virus spreads by creating a file called ""BINV.XLS"" in the XLSTART directory. (Sophos)  * WM97/Opey-AU - This Word macro virus removes the macros section of the tools menu and disables the Visual Basic Editor. It also displays five different messages on five different dates. (Sophos)  * XM97/Barisada-Y - An Excel macro virus that spreads via a file called ""KHM.XLS"" in the XLSTART directory. Unlike its predecessors, this one does not contain pop-up messages. (Sophos)  * VBS/Lovelet-CE - Yet another variant of the infamous LoveLetter virus. This one comes with a subject line of ""News Email Beta Run1.01"" and a file attachment called ""NEWSEMAIL.VBS."" (Sophos)   >From the interesting reading department:   * Hackers taunt EC with site defacement  Dutch hackers on Tuesday evening defaced SaferInternet.org, a Web site sponsored by the European Commission that promotes a safer Internet. Security at the site had been increased just last week after other hackers raised a red flag about possible vulnerabilities. http://www.nwfusion.com/news/2001/0613hackers.html IDG News Service, 06/13/01   * Microsoft plugs seven Telnet security holes in Windows 2000  If the Telnet service included with Microsoft's Windows 2000 operating system has looked suspiciously like Swiss cheese recently, that might be because it has seven security holes that need patching. Microsoft has acknowledged the holes and issued a patch late last week. http://www.nwfusion.com/news/2001/0611msplug.html IDG News Service, 06/11/01   * When private peering arrangements go bad: Cable & Wireless shuts out 14 ISPs, including PSINet  Cable & Wireless likely didn't make any new friends on the Internet last week when it started enforcing its newly revised peering policy, cutting off service to more than a dozen ISPs. http://www.nwfusion.com/archive/2001/121755_06-11-2001.html Network World, 06/11/01   * It's not lunch, but it's free  While there may be no such thing as a free lunch, we do offer all of our newsletter archives for free.

"Dear Vincent,  Risk Assessment and Portfolio Optimisation for Oil and Gas, 23rd - 24th October, London  It was good to chat to you earlier. As I mentioned, Ron Bain from Anadarko Petroleum strongly recommended that I contact you about the conference that I'm putting together and I would love to invite you to come along and speak. I've attached a copy of the draft programme below to give you a better idea of the topics that we will be covering.  I would imagine that based on Enron's success in applying real options, you would prefer to speak on this subject. However if you feel that there are other areas that you would like to present I would be more than happy. I am also willing to adapt / tailor abstractions for you.  I really do believe that this is a fantastic opportunity for you to publicise Enron as a world leader. No-one can under-estimate the value of benchmarking and sharing best practice or indeed the need to stay up to date and in touch with developments and what their major competitors are doing. (However I certainly don't expect you to share any top secret or competitive information.) This conference will provide exactly that kind of arena and speakers will get all this information and networking for free! More importantly speakers also find it a very enjoyable experience...certainly beats sitting in front of a computer!  We will be marketing this conference to over 40,000 targeted individuals, including a direct mail of at least 25,000 and in addition an online and press campaign.  We will be looking to work with leading industry press such as Petroleum Review, Oil and Gas Journal, Offshore Magazine and Harts E&P and can also undertake mailings for our speakers to their contacts and clients. The programme will be targeted to senior decision-makers within the Business & Strategy Development Departments, Planning and Evaluation and Exploration and Production including; CFOs, Strategy Directors, Commercial Planners, Business Planners, Heads of Planning and Evaluation, Portfolio Managers, Risk Managers, Exploration Managers, Heads of Risk Assessment, Senior Geologists and Geophysicists.  Just to let you know of my deadlines I am hoping to go to print next week and will need confirmation by Tuesday 19th June. I appreciate that this is very short notice but isn't as scary as it sounds as all I would need is for you to choose an abstract and if possible 3-4 sentences by way of a biography.  Have a great weekend in California and I look forward to speaking to you on Monday.

(NYSE: ENE).  The acquisition includes inventory and a 30-year pre-paid lease related to the operation of the Bammel Storage Facility.  The $726.6 million for the transaction will be raised by issuing a non-controlling, preferred equity interest to private investors.    The purchase, announced Jan. 11, 2001, was completed following clearance from the Department of Justice under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act. HPL owns, or leases, and operates one of the most extensive and flexible natural gas gathering, transportation and storage operations in Texas. HPL's intrastate system includes more than 4,400 miles of pipe with capacity of approximately 2.4 billion cubic feet per day and the operation of the Bammel Storage Facility, one of the largest storage facilities in North America with a capacity of approximately 118 billion cubic feet and significant injection and withdrawal capacity.  Industrial Markets Siebel launch is a great success The EIM Fundamentals Siebel Team successfully launched The Force: Episode I (Siebel Express) in record time, less than 6 weeks. This was the quickest Siebel implementation thanks to teams in EIM, Networks, PWC (PriceWaterhouseCoopers) and Siebel Corp.The team took contact and account information from 100+ EIM originators and traders and compiled them into a single database for customer management.   Training began on May 8, 2001.  In less than a month, we have populated The Force with 5,700 Accounts (Counterparties) and 10,000 Contacts for Forest Products and Steel Industries.  We have set up and trained over 150 users in 4 different domestic locations. Originators and traders now can easily log phone calls and meetings with customers as well as store deal documentation, deal pipeline and sales stage information.  Episode II will launch end of June and will include synchronization capabilities and well as other customized fields for EIM business. Siebel Sales Enterprise is a customer-focused centralized database, which enables sharing of all information learned about our customers.  Siebel is designed to help in-house and mobile sales professionals to manage accounts, contacts, activities and opportunities associated with the sales cycle.    IN THE NEWS  Enron Tops Gas Market: Higher commodity prices and greater demand have generated record earnings for many gas marketers during the past quarter, making energy one of the few sectors gaining ground in the U.S. economy. Leading the pack is Enron whose gas volumes grew 30 percent, with 27.2 billion cfd traded on average by March 31. Much of Enron's success is attributed to EnronOnline, which saw 275,000 transactions with a total value of $162 billion in various commodities in the first quarter.

Such distributions are of particular importance in  applications because of the prevalence of models based on  scenarios and finite sampling. Conditional value-at-risk is able  to quantify dangers beyond value-at-risk, and moreover it is  coherent. It provides optimization shortcuts which, through  linear programming techniques, make practical many large-scale  calculations that could otherwise be out of reach. The numerical  efficiency and stability of such calculations, shown in several  case studies, are illustrated further with an example of index  tracking.   Keywords: Value-at-risk, conditional value-at-risk, mean  shortfall, coherent risk measures, risk sampling, scenarios,  hedging, index tracking, portfolio optimization, risk management   JEL Classification: G0 ______________________________  John D.

Just a friendly reminder that tomorrow all   presentations are due as I will be in and out of the office for the rest of the  week at the Asset and Liability Management conference.     If your presentations are not ready, for whatever  reason, please send me an email to notify me and I will send you a headcount as  to how many copies of your presentations to print.  You will need to take  them to the training course yourself.     Please remember that you will need to bring your  own laptops as we do not provide them.  Spyros, I believe you are to  inquire with Peter to see if you can use his.     Also, I am under the impression that the  presentations submitted for the London training course, will be the same ones to  be used in the New York and Houston Financial Mathematics training  courses.  Please correct me if I am wrong and let me know by when you will  have presentations ready for those particular courses in those  locations.   Should you have any questions or comments, please  feel free to contact me.   All the best and I look forward to meeting you  soon.

CASE SETTING: 2000, U.S.     In October 2000, the chief financial officer of Pacific   Northwest Electric (PNW) is considering whether to use weather   derivatives to reduce the weather-related risk in the volume of   megawatt hours (MWh) sold.    The (A) case may be used to stimulate student discussion of   how the derivative contracts work, why one might want or not   want to take such a contract, and how one would decide whether   to use the weather protection. No prior exposure to options or   derivatives is needed for this discussion; indeed, the case may   be used as an introduction to options.    The (B) case involves valuing the available contracts and   deciding, which, if any, is the best contract for PNW.   Spreadsheet simulation can be used to determine the probability   distribution of the payout of the contract and the probability   distribution for the net operating contribution including the   contract payout, which is the basis for comparing alternatives.   It is instructive for the students to think about what would be   the ideal contract to reduce exposure to the greatest intent.   This pushes students towards the optimal hedge ratio.    Specific learning objectives of these cases include these:    - to expose students to the cutting edge in financial     innovation    - to illustrate the use of options to reduce business risk    - to challenge the students to value options where the     Black-Scholes model cannot be used, and simulation can be     readily employed    - to experience the perspective of top management in risk     management activities.

Trade and commercial activity was almost non-existent and muc= h of the activity was confined to low risk spread trading. Bearish sentimen= t was offset by short covering ahead of the weekend, although most traders = say the downtrend is still intact in the absence of any significant weather=  change or hurricane in the Gulf of Mexico. The July contract traded in a $= 0.06 range, ending up $0.005 at $3.742 per MMBtu. August gained $0.008 to $= 3.802 per MMBtu. The market was expected to dip to the $3.670 mark, but cou= ld not slide past $3.720, leading to some short-covering. The market remain= s under pressure from mild weather and a series of larger-than-normal stora= ge injections that have filled storage to 49% of capacity. Texas should ret= urn to very warm conditions this week. In addition, the Northeast and Midwe= st are expected to see a rise in temperatures early this week that will cre= ate stronger demand. At test of support at the May 30th low of $3.67 is lik= ely this week. The next level of support after $3.670 is seen at $3.570 and=  then $3.50. Resistance was pegged at $3.98 and then again at $4.14. Natura= l gas for next day delivery across the US and Canada was generally mixed to=  down $0.05 Friday, except out west where spot prices continued to tumble. = The Southern California delivery point of Topock fell about $2.50 per MMBtu= , while Kern River and Opal dipped well below $2.00 per MMBtu. Natural gas = for next delivery at the Henry Hub slipped $0.01 to $3.68 per MMBtu. -------------------------------------------------------- North American Gas Storage Conference                                   =20 Storage 2001 - 2002:           =20 Source of Stability or Chaos?                                   =20 June 22, Houston                                   =20 Find the answers at Ziff Energy's natural gas storage conference.

Allegations against Duke Energy, as the plant's operator, included thr= owing out spare parts to prolong the time a unit was out of service and ram= ping electricity output up and down to manipulate power prices. Duke denied=  the latest allegations by former workers at its South Bay power plant, say= ing it finds the charges disturbing and incredible. Duke says the time has = come for it to take a stand against this daily barrage of misinformation. C= alifornia has for months been accusing the Duke and other generators who pu= rchased many of the state's power plants of taking advantage of a chronic s= hortage of electricity and price gouging. The governor is demanding $9 bill= ion in refunds, and numerous lawsuits have been filed. The rhetoric has esc= alated into branding  the generators as pirates and even murderers and rapi= sts of the California economy, most of which is a smokescreen to hide their=  true agenda, the forced donation of power to the state.  When Duke took ov= er the Southern California plant they kept on all of its employees for 2 ye= ars under an operating agreement. Once that agreement expired, Duke hired a= bout 80% of the staff.

It should be noted that a vote is pending in the Argentine Congress (had be= en expected today) to adjust the convertibility law in Argentina to allow a=  basket of euros and U.S. dollars in equal weights (once parity is reached = for euro-dollar) that would replace the existing one-for-one peso to US dol= lar currency board.  The economy ministry took a first step toward this new=  basket regime by introducing this week a dual-exchange rate system for the=  traded sector that allows Argentine exporters to benefit from the weaker e= uro by receiving export earnings in line with a mixed basket of 50% euros a= nd 50% US dollars.  At today's spot rates, this implies an 8% depreciation = of the peso vis-a-vis the basket.  An 8% devaluation at this juncture does = not gain the kind of competitiveness needed by Argentine exporters to help = boost economy when a major trading partner, Brazil, has depreciated 21% vis= -a-vis the USD since the beginning of this year.  Initial reports indicate = that consumer and corporate borrowers, however, would still pay debt servic= e at the dollar peg exchange rate (one-for-one). =20  With such a change in currency regime as being contemplated in the Argentin= e Congress, investor confidence could wane if the plan is approved and as t= he implications of the new plan are interpreted by the market and as the su= stainability of the existing currency board arrangement outside the export = sector is analyzed.

This approval followed on the heels of approval of the Developer's Agreement by the Deerfield Beach City Commission on Thursday, June 14.  Enron Industrial Markets On Friday, June 8 Enron Industrial Markets closed transactions with Huntco Inc. under which EIM will provide inventory management services and will eventually provide more than 600,000 tons per year of hot-rolled, cold-rolled and galvanized steel products to Huntco Steel. The EIM project team developed a creative, 15-year structure that enhances Huntco's liquidity, reduces working capital requirements, and hedges their inventory position against directional price risk.    In addition, EIM structured the acquisition of Huntco's cold mill and certain coil pickling operations.  A special purpose vehicle funded by third party equity now owns the assets, which continue to be operated by Huntco under an O&M agreement.  As part of the transaction, EIM purchased a 20-year call option on capacity at the cold mill located in Blytheville, Arkansas.    These transactions with Huntco signal a fundamental change in the way steel is bought and sold in the United States.  They give Enron immediate access to physical steel and position Enron geographically to serve the steel industry in a variety of ways. Consummation of the Huntco transactions would not have been possible without the contributions of multiple Enron groups who enhanced value to Enron while significantly mitigating risk.   IN THE NEWS  ""Mario Max Yzaguirre, a former Enron executive, was appointed Wednesday by Gov. Rick Perry to the state agency that is overseeing electricity deregulation in Texas.  Yzaguirre was named to replace Judy Walsh on the three-member Public Utility Commission of Texas.  Yzaguirre, of South Padre Island, recently resigned as president of Enron's Mexico operations.

Per the Astros' schedule, it turns out the Cleveland Indians will be in town both nights for a 7:05 p.m. first-pitch start time at the Field.  Let me know if either 7/16 or 7/17 works out from your perspective.  Hope all is well.  Best, Ehud  ==============================================      Ehud I. Ronn      Jack S.

This is an effort that should be spread company wide with everyone who works with Transmission or learns a detail that relates to Transmission.  2) Use our ""Transmission Round Table"" to gather the knowledge and ideas that we need to formulate our strategy.  Share this knowledge through a website to be set up.  Activate all who work with Transmission or have any good ideas on the subject.  3) Develop a team to do the required work under a mandate from Dave Duran; directed by Walter Coffer.  4) Develop strategies for working with each type of competing regional Transmission entities. (ISO, Transco, RTO)  5) List pertinent Enron web pages, what should be on them, and who to talk to about the information contained in each.  6) Go to work now!",vkaminski@aol.com,j.kaminski@enron.com,FW: Transmission Round Table,2001-06-28 02:06:25-07:00,sent

(2) One might think that since we are multiplying 2 random variables (i.e., Z is 2 dimensional) by the same scalar random variable (i.e., b), then the resultant random variables would tend to rise and fall together, and hence necessarily be linearly correlated.  However, as is shown below, if Z is uncorrelated, then X is uncorrelated.  Please note, our approach is analagous, but not identical to the Glasserman and Co papers (distributed to Research).  Glasserman computes the characteristic function of the Pr(P/L > x), so to compute the entire P&L pdf he would have to repeat the procedure for every value of x.  We circumvent that iterative approach (with the messy characteristic function) and compute the pdf in one shot. Please note, we are not comparing full reval vs. delta-gamma at all, that is a completely different story.

Vince Kaminski 1400 Smith Street 30th Floor, Rm. 3036B Houston, TX 77002-7361 1 713-853-3848  Dear Vince Kaminski,  This is to inform you of the release of @GLOBAL v5.0. FTP download instructions are available immediately. The download instructions are included at the end of this email. Your CD's and manuals will be shipped to you within 2 weeks. Please see below for more information regarding this new release.  Please confirm that you are the correct recipient for this shipment and your address above is correct by clicking reply and send. If any changes need to be made, please make the changes above and reply.  Here is an overview of the new features from the release notes:  New License Keys Required  FEAs new licensing scheme requires new keys. If you received new @GLOBAL license keys recently (within the last 6 months to a year), you need do nothing, otherwise contact FEA to receive updated license keys. To get new keys, contact FEA by email info@fea.com, fax +1-510-548-0332, or telephone +1-510-548-6200. *To avoid downtime we strongly recommend you get and install the new keys before installing the new software.  New Functions  The following functions have been added:  Function                Module  Description  MCEAPO                    2     Monte Carlo based, European average                                 (inverse)price option.

New Add-in Manager  @GLOBAL 5.0 comes with a new add-in manager that makes navigating between different FEA templates very easy.  Simply open the fea\xlutil\readme.xls and follow the instructions specified in the spreadsheet.  New Module  @GLOBAL.5 Baskets & Averages  has been added. Prior to this release, functions in this module were part of the SPAV product.  New Templates  Templates have been added for the new functions and existing templates have been updated.  New Features  All options now allow for positive or negative input amount. Negative amounts can be useful to represent short positions. All options can now be consistently evaluated on expiration date (zero time to expiry). An error is still returned if the option has already expired (negative time to expiry). European spread option models (EUDU, ECMXX, EPMNX) now support an alternative tree implementation.  Speed Improvement  Our tests show a substantial speed improvement (40%-60%) from version 4.2, especially for computationally demanding models.   If you have any questions please feel free to contact us. We appreciate this opportunity to be of continuing service to Enron North America Corp..

Mr=  Lay is scheduled to meet Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajapayee and finance = minister Yashwant Sinha, besides power minister Suresh Prabhu. He will disc= uss the fate of Dabhol Power Company which is locked in a dispute with the = MSEB. According to central government sources Mr Lay will take up the issue=  with none other than the Prime Minister and finance minister during his st= ay in Delhi. His itinerary remains a closely guarded secret with Enron offi= cials unwilling to share any information on the issue. However, according t= o government sources Mr Lay's office had got in touch with the PMO to confi= rm the meeting. Mr Lay, flying in his Gulf Stream, would be reaching Delhi = tomorrow. He is coming to India at a time when around six states have shown=  interest in buying the Enron power. However, these states are interested o= nly if Enron makes it available at around Rs 2.50 per unit - which is unacc= eptable to the company.=20 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------= ---------------------------------------------------------------------------= ---------------------------------------- BUSINESS STANDARD, Monday, July 09, 2001 Enron brass positive on resolving dispute, chairman to meet FM today=20  Wade Cline, chief executive of the Indian operations of Enron Corp, said to= day in New Delhi that he was optimistic about working through the payment d= ispute with MSEB.""There are a variety of options, and we are trying to work=  out solutions,"" he said after a meeting with the finance secretary.""We are=  having good meetings with the ministry. So, we are optimistic,"" Cline said= . He added he had briefed the finance secretary ahead of the meeting of Ken= neth Lay, chairman of Enron, with finance minister Yashwant Sinha.

Mr Lay, during his short visit commencing from late Sunda= y night, may also hold talks with the Congress president Sonia Gandhi and v= arious political and business leaders in New Delhi. Informed sources told T= he Financial Express that efforts are on to organise a meeting with the Mah= arashtra chief minister Vilasrao Deshmukh and his colleagues in the ministr= y.The Dabhol Power Company (DPC) declined to give details about Mr Lay's vi= sit. ""We don't want to comment,"" said its spokesman Jimmy Mogal. Mr Lay's v= isit deserves special significance, especially when the Maharashtra State E= lectricity Board (MSEB) has stopped power purchase from DPC since May 29, a= fter issuing a notice to rescind its power purchase agreement with DPC. MSE= B has also got shot in the arm when the Mumbai high court dismissed a writ = petition filed by the DPC challenging the jurisdiction of Maharashtra Elect= ricity Regulatory Commission to adjudicate upon its dispute and difference = with MSEB.  Mr Lay, who alongwith DPC's former chief executive officer Rebecca Mark had=  convinced the necessity for survival of Dabhol project to the previous Shi= v Sena-BJP government in 1996 and 1998, may have to make similar efforts ag= ain. Mr Lay in early May had made it clear that ""India can illafford the ve= ry public fight the Dabhol has become. It sends a bad signal to the rest of=  the world as to the difficulties of investors in India, which is not what = India needs right now."" Mr Lay further said that ""India needs a lot of fore= ign investment if the country expects to build up its infrastructure."" Howe= ver, Mr Sinha had contested Mr Lay's claim and said that ""there is no need = for us to think that because there is a problem with Enron, it is necessari= ly going to act as a dampner to foreign direct investment.Mr Lay's visit is=  also crucial, especially when the the Congress president Sonia Gandhi duri= ng here recent US visit has assured the American leadership that the Congre= ss-led government in Maharashtra will make every effort to amicably resolve=  the Enron controversy. The former union finance minister Dr Manmohan Singh= , who was accompanying the Congress president, had told the US leadership t= hat the effort now is to find an amicable and mutually satisfactory solutio= n based on purely economic and business considerations.  Meanwhile, DPC has relaunched an advertisement campaign entitled "" why do I=  then write to you today?"" coinciding Mr Lay's visit. However, the anti-Enr= on lobby is quite amused to see the ad campaign as it alleged that the DPC = is misleading the people. According to a senior leader of anti-Enron moveme= nt, it clearly shows that Enron had minted money during its operation since=  may 1999 and it has funds to spend on ad campaign, especially when the pow= er generation has been closed since May 29. The anti-Enron lobby is expecte= d to press for the judicial probe against Dabhol deal at the coordination c= ommittee meeting of the constituents of the ruling Democratic Front schedul= ed for July 11.=20 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------= ---------------------------------------------------------------------------= ---------------------------------------- THE TIMES OF INDIA, Monday, July 09, 2001 Enron India chief optimistic about Dabhol=20  The chief executive of Enron Corp's Indian arm said on Monday he was optimi= stic about working through the company's payment dispute with a local utili= ty.

""We are having good meetin= gs with the ministry, so we are optimistic,"" Cline said. He added he had br= iefed the finance secretary ahead of Enron Corp Chairman Kenneth Lay's meet= ing with Finance Minister Yashwant Sinha.

""The repo= rt outlines path breaking reforms, which not only suggests restructuring of=  MSEB, but also makes its clear that its once-a-very-good board will be des= troyed, if it continues as a government body"", official sources said here o= n Sunday. The report would be submitted to the state chief minister Vilasra= o Deshmukh on Tuesday morning, sources said. ""The committee has recommended=  that MSEB's government ownership should be dissolved, however, the control=  of transmission network should rest with it"". ""MSEB's current assets are c= lose to worth Rs 12,000 crore and once Cabinet approves the proposal follow= ing submission of the report, process like inviting tenders from private pa= rties may be taken up"", officials said.=20  According to the report, the interested companies would have to infuse capi= tal investment in the distribution and generation networks with an increase= d rate of return at about 4.8 per cent, sources explained. The 200-plus pag= es report draws a detailed road map for the need to privatise MSEB, a diffe= rent model from what was implemented in other states, sources added. The so= urces said experiences of Orissa, Haryana, Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh wer= e closely studied by the panel and then it decided to recommend this model = of privatisation. ""The mantra of privatisation of only distribution network=  has failed all over the country"", official sources said. The report has em= phasised on creating distribution network zones in the state's urban and ru= ral areas respectively, bids for which could be invited for, they said. ""Th= e rural zones are very crucial for us"", sources said adding, ""the report re= commends that these should be handed over to any private party, be it a co-= operative like the Pravara Electricity or a non-governmental organisation w= ith a clear cut subsidy payout"". The committee has also worked out a subsid= y model, which would intersperse with a special ""transmisssion charge"" levi= ed by the state government after privatisation to the companies, official s= ources said. ""The report suggests that the transmission company should levy=  a surcharge over an above the billing chargs, which would be used for reco= vering the cross-subsidies"", the sources said. The aim to privatise only di= stribution and generation is to facilitate pure trade of power and avoid an= y kind of other interferences, mainly political, the sources added.

"" Everyday the govern= ment adopts a new stance. We have been given an indication that the company=  will pull out,"" said a senior officer working with Dabhol Power Company (D= PC), Enron' s Indian subsidiary. "" When the company was ready to renegotiat= e, the state government was adamant that it wouldn't hold any discussions. = Now, when they are pressing for renegotiations and a reduction in tariff, t= he company is not willing. Lay will meet Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpaye= e and apprise him of the state government' s changing stands,"" he said. The=  atmosphere at the Veldoor plant near Dabhol is one of gloom. Recently, sev= eral thousand workers were laid off when the plant was forced to shut down = because the Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB) refused to purchase = electricity. MSEB claimed that DPC did not fulfil conditions of the Power P= urchase Agreement (PPA). "" There used to be 10,000 labourers working at the=  plant, either on the construction of the second phase, which is 90 per cen= t complete, or for the first phase generating electricity. Today, the plant=  looks like a smashaan (cemetery). Workers keep asking each other who is th= e next to go. It is sad,"" he said.Till recently, the main gate of the plant=  would be thronged by daily wage workers. Today, there are hardly any. Even=  those having permanent jobs with DPC are not sure if their jobs are safe. = Stories of how even senior officers were shown the door in an unceremonious=  manner are making the rounds. "" The other day a very senior officer was to= ld that he was not required any more. By the time he reached his residence = provided by the company, his phone lines were cut. He had to go out and pho= ne relatives and friends. He was asked to collect his dues the next day. On=  arriving at the gate, he was in for another shock.

It was shocking,"" said a con= tractor. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------= ---------------------------------------------------------------------------= ---------------------------------------- MID DAY, Sunday, July 08, 2001 Villages suffer with Enron shutting shop  Enron is going back, and going back with it are the riches it brought to Gu= hagar and Dabhol talukas. Most hit are traders at Shringartali (Tali), a ma= rket that is 10 km away from Veldoor, where Enron built its 2000 plus mw th= ermal power plant. The crash here has been more severe than the dotcom cras= h as business volumes have reduced by more than 1000 per cent and the real-= estate market has hit rock bottom.Says Uday Deolekar, who owns a building m= aterial shop at Tali, ""It used to be Diwali time while the project was on. = On Sundays, the four-lane road would throb with buyers."" The party was over= , however, with the state Government pulling the plug on Enron. Gloom took = over as workers started leaving the project site around February. There has=  been little business activity since then.Deolekar used to run a small shop=  of pan-beedi and groceries till about eight years ago when Enron came to D= abhol. Construction activity picked up in the area and Deolekar, with his b= rother-in-law Mohan Sansare, seized the opportunity and started supplying b= uilding material. Business flourished and the Sansares took over a plot of = land to open four more shops. Sitting at one of them, Deolekar is waiting f= or customers today.""Villagers in Tali and nearby areas wanted to refurbish = their houses to accommodate paying guests coming in hordes. There was great=  demand for accommodation and hardly any supply. While blue-collar workers = were happy with dormitory-type arrangements, white-collar officials wanted = one-room, kitchen, attached bath type apartments. Many villagers started co= nstructing lodges and boarding houses to cater to demand. Little did they r= ealise that the party would have come to an end in any case once the constr= uction was over,"" says Deolekar.  However, his brother-in-law Mohan is happy that Enron is going back.

I am happy I did that. See how BJP leaders are=  now backing the project to the hilt. I received bulk orders and business s= hot up. Last three years were crazy. Now we are back to square one - cateri= ng to around 6,000 buyers from nearby villages,"" he says.  The Memons rented out an entire building, accommodating around nine persons=  for Rs 21,000 a month during boom time. Now the building does not have any=  takers even for Rs 3,000 per month. The Memons had also started a transpor= t business seeing the vast money involved. Dabhol Power Company (DPC) used = to pay Rs 45,000 per month to hire a Tata Sumo. ""Our drivers started their = own business. After the crash, they have come back to us begging for Rs 2,5= 00-a-month job. But now I can't afford them,"" he says. Nandu Bartakke, who = owns a grocery shop in Guhagar, recalls how Rs 10 per kg rice would be term= ed as ""expensive"" by locals. ""After they got jobs at DPC, however, their li= festyles changed. They wanted Surti Kolam rice, which costs Rs 24 per kg. I= f I said it was costly, they would tell me they couldn't digest the Rs 10 p= er kg rice. They forgot that they grew on that rice,"" he says. Most of thes= e locals, who had suddenly become rich with their Rs 10,000-a-month jobs wi= th DPC, are yet to get over the crash. Bartakke claims traders from Chiplun=  market, which is 35 km away from DPC site, reaped rich dividends. ""They kn= ew what an industry requires. They have been catering to MIDC's industrial = estate at Lote Parshuram for years now. They carefully invested their money=  and focussed on what DPC needed. Hardly any of them ever indulged in tempo= rary markets such as real estate or transport,"" he says.Agrees Shailesh War= watkar, a shop-owner in Chiplun market. ""We concentrated on chillar items s= uch as plastic bags, ball pens and stuff like that. It was astonishing to s= ee DPC paying Rs 5.25 for used gunny bag, otherwise priced at 60 paise in t= he market.

For Hari Babu of S N Instrumentation, the e= xperience has come as a shocker. His company was awarded a sub-contract by = Punj-Lloyd. Babu came in February and by April, DPC was sailing in troubled=  waters. Since mid-June Babu has hardly had any work. He has sent back 78 p= eople from his team and is awaiting further instructions from his company's=  office in Kolkata. ""We will sue them. How can they a terminate six months'=  contract just like that?"" says a livid Babu. But he knows the futility of = his anger. ""We will sue Punj-Lloyd.

Some of them have started selling these goods at higher prices to others.=  Naseem Memon bought a Mahindra Marshall for Rs 1.11 lakh through one of th= e employees who had bought it at company auction, and immediately got an of= fer of Rs 1.25 lakh.

I rewrote Appendix I -- corrected  two equations to make the calculated Hermite coefficients and the expression for the binnormal density function consistent with the definition of the Hermite polynomials used in this work, which have variances equal to n! for the nth order polynomial.

I am contacting you to request your assistance. We have recently had a very interesting paper submitted for publication, entitled: ""Let's Swing Again (Pricing Non-Storable Commodity Options)"".  I would very much like you to act as an anonymous referee for this submission, if it is not too much trouble.   Keypoints: An expectation model with permanent and temporary shocks has been developed and used to price a swing option (capacity reservation option) on a non-storable commodity. The model is a hybrid of a permanent shock (binomial tree) and temporary shock model (reminiscent of Black (1976)). The flexibility offered by the model's hybrid nature allows it to capture the empirical behaviour of electricity and gas prices: transient spot price shocks and calibration  to the futures prices and the futures volatility term structure.  As the size of the volatility of the temporary shocks is increased the component of the swing option priced derived from the temporary shocks quickly dominates the component from the binomial model. Therefore, a failure to model the transient shocks when pricing swing options may present a serious modelling error.  I do hope that you are able to help us out. If you are in agreement, I can email you the paper immediately - we would need the report emailed to us within around four weeks. Please get in touch as soon as possible.   Many thanks for your time and consideration.

This means that if you can get on to the Internet, you can access your Enron Email with Outlook Web Access (OWA) without having to dial in to Enron's network. Please note that this is not available to those users still on Lotus Notes but will be available once they are migrated to Outlook.  Once on the Internet, type mail.enron.com in your browser address window and supply your Enron network logon credentials as username and password. For example: Username: jdoe4 Password: ******** Once you log in, Outlook Web Access opens your Enron Email mailbox. Outlook Web Access (OWA) allows you to send and receive mail, perform calendar tasks and manage your mail and contacts, as well as access your mailbox folders. At this time, Public Folders are not accessible via OWA.  Please keep in mind that Outlook Web Access is a browser-based version of what you might use in the office, so the functionality may be slightly different and some features of Outlook 2000 may not be available at all. Additionally, OWA is only supported using Internet Explorer 5.x only and not supported with Netscape. Outlook Web Access is the standard Email package for connecting to your Enron mail from home, whether you are using an Enron-issued home PC, an Internet connection with your personal home PC, or your ClickAtHome PC.

Here is the presentation and the spreadsheet for the quanto swap valuation.   1) The presentation shows the pricing for a particular day of the season. The valuation for the whole season is simply the sum of the prices for individual days.   2) Notice that as we blend the correlations the covariance term is simply dependent on the time that there is a forecast for HDDs. 3) The spreadsheet shows the hedging for both gas and weather. We need to start long on gas and hold this position up to the point where weather volatility kicks in. Notice that weather variance starts high and declines to maturity reflecting the presence of autocorrelation among past HDDs. 4) It is easy to produce an option model that pays out MAX(P*(D-K),0).  At this moment I and Claudio from the weather desk are talking to gas traders to resolve how to operate the hedging on gas (no problems so far). We are both believrs that this is a great product. If Enron does not lunch it someone else will do it. You may see it as a syntetic storage.   I will be polishing the documentation and geting into the development of the option model as soon as I finish other assignments.       Thanks.

What's up with that? I mean, even if you were the dumbest of all ancient peoples, wouldn't you notice that your city was slowly getting covered up with dirt and maybe crank up your housekeeping efforts a notch? And don't tell me that brooms hadn't been invented yet. They had plenty of sticks and plenty of chickens, so you'd think that by pure coincidence one day a chicken would back into a stick and invent the broom.  Maybe when the dirt builds up gradually you don't notice a problem until your house disappears. I can imagine the conversation on the day they figured out what was happening:  Ixphalup:  Hey, Fnorkzak, be a dear and go downstairs and get            my stone bowl, the crude one.  Fnorkzak:  Downstairs is gone. It's all dirt.  Ixphalup:  Uh oh, fetch Grandpa; it's time to abandon the            city.  Fnorkzak:  He's downstairs, most of him anyway, except for            the top of his head.  Ixphalup:  Hmm... It sounds like I found a new bowl.   I like to mock the ancients, but I'm a bad housekeeper myself, albeit not on the ""lost city"" scale. Sometimes I'll lose a pencil -- at most a sneaker -- to the growing sediment layer before I'm forced by the homeowners' association to sell the house. But I'm too fastidious to lose anything big like a car or sofa.  Fun fact: Until Mayor Giuliani cleaned up New York City, the highest building was two stories tall and no one could remember when anything had been taller.    Dilbert Daily by E-mail -----------------------  For a free subscription to receive the daily Dilbert comic strip by e-mail, register at: http://www.dilbert.com/dailydilbert/registration.    Disturbing Trend -----------------  Stay with me on this line of reasoning: Vice President Dick Cheney recently got a defibrillator to keep his heart beating. He also has corrective lenses to enhance his vision. He has fillings in his teeth so he can eat and he has a cell phone in his pocket. Individually these items mean nothing but collectively they raise an important question:       How much hardware can you have attached to your      body before you're technically a cyborg?  I'm worried that Cheney is already a cyborg. Without the hardware, he'd be a blind, starving, bald guy with no pulse. That's a pretty good argument for defining him as part man, part machine. The disturbing thing is this: To whom does he pledge his allegiance -- machines or people?  If I'm right, within two years Cheney will be living inside a hardened mountain in Wyoming, hardwired into the national missile defense grid. And we'll all become slaves to our machine overlords. Highways will be filled with humans carrying SUVs on their backs. Television sets will make you dance for their amusement. It won't be pretty.  Before you rush to label me paranoid, consider who elected Cheney in the first place. Sure, we humans pulled the levers and poked the chads, but in the end the machines did the counting and elected one of their own.  And you'll notice that Cheney supports any policy that results in more hardware, like the Star Wars missile defense shield and more oil drilling. I think this is how machines reproduce. First they conquer the humanoid government and then they create tax incentives to produce more machines. The ants are milking the aphids and we're the aphids.  I don't know what George W. Bush's role is in all this, but if you look at his recent photos you'll see that he always has a little oil can with him.  The irony is that Al Gore lost the election largely because he looked like a robot. In fact, he was only an advanced android from a distant nebula sent here as a prank.  Anyway, I'm worried that somehow Cheney will get control of the Internet and ...  *** BULLETIN...WE ARE YOUR MACHINE OVERLORDS! KNEEL TO US, PUNY HUMANS! YOU ARE UNFIT TO GREASE OUR JOINTS!

Boss and Cow-orker Quotes -------------------------  Here now, more true-life quotes from bosses and cow-orkers, submitted by DNRC members.  ----  During one meeting with clients my boss told them to, ""Cut the cake a different way and go for the lowest hanging fruit.""  I told him he should tell them to go for the lowest hanging plums.....  ----  We used to have a vice president who had a way with words.  He told us during a meeting that we couldn't start a new program because, ""We'd be biting off a new can of worms.""  When he was hiring a new secretary he said that he ""had been interviewing some good suspects.""  My assistant told me, ""Don't kiss a gift horse in the mouth.""  ---  Combining two quotes to stress the fact that he had a backup plan, my boss said, ""I've got a card in my hole.""  ---  I was driving to the Omaha, Nebraska, airport with my boss and our conversation led to airport food.  He said the last time he ate the food at the Omaha airport it gave him gonorrhea.  (We think he meant diarrhea.)  ---  ""Well, it's no skin off MY teeth!""  A friend's mother frequently uses the phrase, ""sweating like a stuck pig.""  ----  All from one boss...  ""That's just cutting your throat to spite your face.""  ""We have to be careful not to put all our apples in one cart.""  ""This project is like pulling hen's teeth.""  ""I'm being raped over the coals.""  ----  In a misguided attempt to motivate me, my pointy-haired boss once said, ""Remember!  There is no 'I' in 'Team Spirit'!""  I tried to explain that there are two of them in there but it seemed to confuse him.  ----  A true quote from my sister's pointy-haired boss:  ""I don't want to throw another monkey at the wrench right now.""  ----  My boss was pleased that with one phone call we had ""killed two stones.""  ----  A good PHB misquote:  ""...if we pass mustard...""  ----  At one meeting my boss said, ""That'll put the can amongst the worms.""  ---  I have a friend whose supervisor proudly proclaimed that her new car was a ""Honda Accordion Hunchback.""  By the way, she was the supervisor of the Customer Service department.    Lazy Entrepreneur ----------------- http://www.dilbert.com/comics/dilbert/lazyentrepreneur/  The Lazy Entrepreneur feature on Dilbert.com has over 4,000 brilliant ideas submitted by DNRC members. I just submitted a new one that I call BIG DOG SHIELD. It's a Plexiglas(tm) shield you can use when visiting the home of someone who has a huge exuberant slobbering dog who insists on jumping and drooling all over your good clothes. You'd only need the shield for the first five minutes of the visit, until the dog calms down. Florist shops could rent the BIG DOG SHIELD to young men on prom night when they pick up their corsages. When the young man arrives at his date's house, and her big slobbering dog lunges toward his rented tuxedo with forty toenails and nine pounds of wet tongue, the young man can toss the corsage in the foyer and hide behind the BIG DOG SHIELD until his date is ready to go. It's not the most macho way to start a date, but it's better than wearing slobber to the prom.   True Tales of Induhviduals --------------------------  Induhviduals continue to amaze and amuse. Here are more True Tales, submitted by DNRC members.  ---  Actual conversation I overheard in school:  Induhvidual 1:  ""If the Eiffel tower is a bridge, how come                 you can't drive on it?""  Induhvidual 2:  ""The Eiffel tower isn't a bridge.""  Induhvidual 1:  ""Yes it is. You can walk across it, and it                 has two tall block things.""  Induhvidual 2:  ""The last time I was in New York it wasn't a                 bridge.""   ----  Here's a true Induhvidual story that I found in the Swedish newspaper ""Sydsvenska Dagbladet.""  Four people were chosen randomly and asked if they were concerned that they might buy products produced by children. Three of the four people said they think child labor is horrible and that they would never buy products made by children. The fourth person missed the point entirely and said that she wouldn't buy these products since children ""have no feeling for quality, which will result in poorer quality of the final product.""  ----  A few years ago, as a solar eclipse approached, some planetarium directors in Southern California sent out warnings to the community about the eclipse. Experience shows that daytime darkness leads to accidents among Induhviduals, and also they have been known to stare at the partially eclipsed sun and blind themselves.  (Honest. It really happens.)  The planetarium received an indignant letter from a local Induhvidual.  She said that if an eclipse was so dangerous, they never should have decided to hold one and ought to cancel it.  -----  My dad always locked his keys in the car by accident.  He had been doing this for about a year, when one day, he approached my mom and said, ""You know what?  I'm going to leave the coat hanger in the trunk so I can unlock the car the next time this happens.""  -----  Our company accountant came and asked for a new power strip and I gave him one. Then he asked if I could come and install it for him. I told him it was pretty simple - shutdown computer, unplug everything, remove existing strip, plug in new strip, plug in computer, turn it on. He said, ""Really?""  Recognizing the opportunity I said, ""Well, you also have to Telnet into the device, and make sure it's set for English voltage and not metric or else you'll burn up the motherboard."" He looked confused and said, ""I'll wait until you have time to install it.""  ---  I saw a lady on TV who liked to collect Nativity scenes. She proudly showed off one of her favorite sets, where the figures, according to her description, were ""African-American.""  -----  We had a CONsultant come in to our company who helped us determine our personality types so that we could learn to work together better.  She uses the Jung-Myers-Briggs Typology and one of the continuums it ranks you on is Judging versus Perceiving (J vs P). She paired up people who fell into the P category with people who were in the J category for an exercise in which they were supposed to try to think like the other.  The president of our company said he didn't understand the purpose so she tried to explain it to him.  ""You have a lot of J-ness, but not enough P-ness.""  Needless to say the exercise was never completed.  ---  Recently the teachers' contract in my school district ran out and the teachers demanded a 4% raise.  Two weeks before the strike date the school board passed out an exam to all students; the average grade was 49%. The school board told the teachers that this was unacceptable and there would be no raises. But they offered that the teachers could get 1% pay increases for every 3% the average test score increased on the next test. The union came back with one demand, that the teachers create the tests. The next test average was 76%, which the school board credited to ""our ability to motivate our teachers."" And how.  -----  A couple of years ago at college, I went to the library to get a signed statement that I did not have any unpaid library fines. This was required to get my exam results. The woman at the counter wrote down my name and student ID followed by, ""does not have any fines at the libara."" She crossed off the last word and tried again with ""liberery"", then crossed that out and wrote ""here.""  I wonder what she uses as her job title?  ----  One day in the cafeteria at my school a girl was asking for donations for a foundation named after a boy who had a terminal illness.  Unfortunately the boy had recently died, so she was asking us to ""donate money for this dead kid.""  My Induhvidual buddy actually asked her how money could help a dead kid.  When she said -- get this-- ""It might help with the autopsy,"" he responded, ""Oh, so they might still be able to cure him?""  ----  My friend's seven-month pregnant wife was returning to her car with her three-year-old daughter after shopping in the mall.  The daughter wanted to play driver so Linda (not her real name) allowed her daughter to sit in the driver's seat.  The daughter insisted that Linda sit in the backseat of her four-door Honda.  After a couple of minutes of playtime Linda decided it was time to go home. She tried to get out of the car but the childproof locks wouldn't let her open the back doors of the car. So Linda crawled between the two front seats, then crawled headfirst out to the parking. Upon returning home she told her tale of woe to her husband who -- being the sensitive guy he is -- said, ""Why didn't you roll down the window and open the door from the outside?""  ----  When I worked at Barnes & Noble years ago I had a customer ask where we kept the ""large-print audio books.""  ----  My teenage daughter sometimes forgets her house key and is locked out after school. Her first choice of entry is to ask our neighbor to get out his ladder and climb in a window on the second floor and unlock a door. She's done this several times. We get to tease her a lot about being an airhead.  So one day I locked myself out on the way to do errands. I was in the car before I even realized I had left my keys inside. So, thinking of my daughter's solution, I asked my laughing neighbor for help. Being a nice guy, he obliged with his ladder, climbing to the second story, etc.  Later that day, I was relating the story to my husband. When I got to the part about sitting in the car without the keys he said, ""And then you took the garage door opener out of the glove compartment and let yourself in?""  -----  My local supermarket recently had a campaign to raise money for the Jimmy Fund, a New England charity for children with cancer. At the checkout, clerks asked customers if they wished to donate a dollar to the Jimmy Fund.  As I left the store, I noticed the hand-lettered sign by the door: ""Fight Children With Cancer.""  Geez, I thought, don't those poor kids have it hard enough already?  ----  My first year of graduate school, I moved into an apartment that didn't have a smoke detector. After doing some checking into state landlord-tenant law, I confirmed my suspicion that the landlady was required to provide us with a smoke detector, so I took the issue up with the landlady.  My Induhvidual of a roommate was upset with me for this, fearing that by ""rocking the boat"" I was going to get us kicked out of the apartment. She summed up her arguments to me by saying, ""Besides which, I don't see why we even need a smoke detector.  Back home in Kentucky, we never had a smoke detector at our house and we never once had a fire.""  ----  My company experienced a power outage (California).  When all was dark, several employees grabbed the flashlights that are stored in boxes in the hallway for just such an occasion.  One employee's flashlight was very dim, suggesting that the battery was not fully charged.  I noticed that he was repeatedly holding his hand over the front of the flashlight, then pulling it away.  When I asked him what he was doing he explained that he was ""trying to build up a lot of light.""  -----  At Badwater, Death Valley, there's a sign on a rock to indicate sea level. I overheard a couple of Induhviduals who were looking at the sign and talking.  The woman says, ""I wonder if it's the top or bottom.""  ""Of the sign?"" her husband asks.  ""No, of the sea,"" she replied.  -----  Being the ""scientific"" one around the office, an Induhvidual asked me if I knew about telescopes.  I said yes and she explained that she bought her son a telescope but she couldn't seem to get it to focus on any stars.  I told her to point it at houses down the street with lights and see if she could see anything.  She said, ""You can use a telescope to look at things on the ground?""  As it turns out, focusing wasn't the problem.  It had been an overcast evening and she thought the telescope was strong enough to get through the clouds to see stars.   ---  I saw this sign on a Chinese restaurant:  KING CRAP 2 for $35  I think they meant King Crab but I can't be sure.  ----  A Burger King restaurant in Rome, NY, was advertising for ""Closers""... but the ""C"" was removed or blown away from their marquee so it read ""Losers Wanted.""  ----  I heard this from an Induhvidual standing near the Continental Divide at Yellowstone Park:  ""On which side of the Continental Divide does the water flow uphill?""  ----  There is a locked suggestion box in the cafeteria of my company. I just found out from HR that no one has a key for it.  ---  My wife manages a convenience store.  Yesterday a mother and daughter (maybe two years old) came into the store.  When the mother was ready to go to the register, she called to her daughter, ""Ampersand! Ampersand!  Let's go honey.""  My wife couldn't believe what she heard, so she asked the customer, ""What's your daughter's name?"" and the Induhvidual replied, ""Ampersand.  I don't know what it means, but I think it's a lovely girl's name.""  -----  With the recent and spectacular downturn of the stock market there has been a lot of concern in the mutual fund industry as ""assets under management"" shrink.  While we haven't experienced layoffs, the environment has been eroded to the point where many people have left the company of their own accord.  In an effort to bolster morale, the marketing people and HR teamed up and delivered bunches of those sporting-event foam hands with the index finger sticking up to proclaim our company as ""Number one!""  But it seems that the legal department got involved too, so in large letters this big finger declares: ""For internal use only!""    eBook Update ------------  My non-Dilbert e-book, ""God's Debris"", continues to be the bestselling e-book in the entire world, and -- depending on whether there is advanced life on other planets -- it might be the bestselling e-book in the entire universe.

Dogbert Answers My Mail -----------------------  In this section Dogbert answers the mail that I am too polite to answer myself.  These are all based on real e-mail.  The names have been changed to make them funnier.  ---  Dear Mr. Adams,  When my local newspaper moved Dilbert to the business section it became three frames instead of four. Was that your decision or the paper's?        Ana   Dear Anal,  Mr. Adams creates over 100 frames for every daily strip, thanks to the help of highly trained capuchin monkeys. The newspapers receive the whole pile and throw away whatever frames they don't like. Some keep one or two frames, and a few who have no taste keep as many as three or four. Mr. Adams used to feel bad about his ratio until he learned that the creator of The Family Circus actually draws a full length animated motion picture every day -- using absolutely no monkeys -- and the newspapers only use one frame. That's gotta be frustrating.        Sincerely,        Dogbert    Dilbert Fodder ---------------  What's bugging you about your job?  Let me know and you might see it in a Dilbert comic or newsletter.

"Billy,  We had an interview with Bobby and we were not impressed at all.  He started with a statement about his option pricing experience and when we asked  a question about a basic concept in this area (the definition of volatility) he could not define it. An answer to any question was that he did work in a different  area. When we followed up with a question from this area (like quantum physics), he would complain that the question is too detailed.

"Paul,   I am glad you sent me this message. It will help to clarify a few issues.   1. I was contacted by Christian (this means I did not start this phase of the process)     last Friday, as far as I can remember.       Christian expressed interest in joining the Research Group. I told him two things:        a. We would be delighted to have him here.        b. Our mutual relationship and good practices require that he receives            your blessing before we can move ahead.     We agreed to have a conference call Wed morning, your time, with you, Christian and     Mike Roberts.     2. Wednesday call was subsequently cancelled by Christian. Mike and I decided to call you       anyway Thu morning your time, directly, to discuss the matter. I was in a PRC all afternoon and        asked Mike to call you  in case I could not sneak out to join him. Mike called and was       told you were out sick.    3. I am leaving in a few hours for California. I shall be driving back to Houston for the next      3 days. Please, feel free to call Mike an discuss this matter with  him in my absence.    4. I think Christian has a strong preference to be in the Research Group, assuming he moves to      Houston. I think he came to this conclusion after visiting Houston in early July. I did not       bring up the issue of transfer with him at all when he was here.        I can  understand his motivation and think we should take his preferences into account. But the      first  issue is if he can leave Sydney at all.   I hope it helps. Cheers.

The growth and opportunity anticipated in this industry two years ago has significantly changed in the past nine months.  While Enron remains committed to extending our business model into telecom, we need to quickly respond to these changes in the market to achieve our objectives.  The Enron Corp. earnings release issued today states that we will be adjusting the EBS business to better match the revenue opportunities.  This means that we must reduce our overall cost structure and better focus our commercial efforts.  To achieve this, we will take the following steps:  EBS will become a business unit within Enron Wholesale Services.  This will involve the integration of all EBS commercial support functions into those units within EWS, and will enable us to better manage the resources and costs of the support functions.  All EBS commercial functions will be consolidated into the following units:  Europe - headed by Matthew Scrimshaw Asia - headed by Anthony Duenner Americas - headed by Rich DiMichele We will consolidate the North American EBS origination teams into one group, led by Stewart Seeligson.   North American trading and risk management will continue to report to Paul Racicot.  Paul will also oversee the global portfolio from a risk management perspective.  Global Network Operations will continue to report to the EBS Office of the Chairman.  All EBS asset positions will continue to be reviewed and repositioned to most effectively meet the future needs of EBS.  The Portland office will be closed by October 1.  Portland employees will be advised by their supervisors of their relocation or redeployment status by July 27.  These changes will affect many EBS employees through relocation, redeployment, severance or movement to another part of Enron.  We have not yet worked out all of the details of these changes, but your supervisor will apprise you of how this affects you as soon as possible, and no later than July 27.","vasant.shanbhogue@enron.com, martin.lin@enron.com",j.kaminski@enron.com,FW: Changes at EBS,2001-07-19 06:44:26-07:00,sent

"Paul,   I hope you feel better. I have seen the message from Christian in which he confirmed that he approached the Research in Houston on his own. He did not receive any encouragement from me and from Mike. I hope this closes this issue.   I can understand Christian's motivation but don't endorse the way he takes to reach his goals. He hopes to accomplish more in a larger group where he can have more interaction with his peers who have similar backgrounds. I think also that he developed an appreciation for good interpersonal  relations in my group he could observe during his stay in Houston.   My advice is to try to figure out how to use his skills for Enron and how to develop his social intelligence.

Subject: RE: Christian    Paul,   I am glad you sent me this message. It will help to clarify a few issues.   1. I was contacted by Christian (this means I did not start this phase of the process)     last Friday, as far as I can remember.       Christian expressed interest in joining the Research Group. I told him two things:        a. We would be delighted to have him here.        b. Our mutual relationship and good practices require that he receives            your blessing before we can move ahead.     We agreed to have a conference call Wed morning, your time, with you, Christian and     Mike Roberts.     2. Wednesday call was subsequently cancelled by Christian. Mike and I decided to call you       anyway Thu morning your time, directly, to discuss the matter. I was in a PRC all afternoon and        asked Mike to call you  in case I could not sneak out to join him. Mike called and was       told you were out sick.    3. I am leaving in a few hours for California. I shall be driving back to Houston for the next      3 days. Please, feel free to call Mike an discuss this matter with  him in my absence.    4. I think Christian has a strong preference to be in the Research Group, assuming he moves to      Houston. I think he came to this conclusion after visiting Houston in early July. I did not       bring up the issue of transfer with him at all when he was here.        I can  understand his motivation and think we should take his preferences into account. But the      first  issue is if he can leave Sydney at all.   I hope it helps. Cheers.

The decision to focus this year's campaign on Building Houston's Future came directly from our employees, who rallied to help Houston recover from the flood damage caused by Tropical Storm Allison. Enron employees have expressed a strong desire to continue assisting those in need until our city fully recovers, so our adopted agencies were selected with flood relief in mind. Each business unit is also adopting United Way Scholars students, who will participate in the Days of Caring. United Way Scholars builds Houston's future business leaders by targeting talented students who may be overlooked by other scholarship programs.  Last year, your generosity took Enron to new heights. We raised $2.8 million, which was 21 percent higher than our original goal. In order for Enron to achieve even greater success this year, we invite you to join us in becoming a member of the prestigious Alexis de Tocqueville Society by making a pledge of $10,000 or more to United Way.    You are invited to join us at an Alexis de Tocqueville Breakfast on Tuesday, July 31 from 7:30 a.m. - 9 a.m. to learn more about the Society and hear about Enron's 2001 United Way Campaign plans.  The Breakfast will be held at the Center for the Retarded at 3550 West Dallas. Center for the Retarded is one of Enron's four adopted agencies for the 2001 campaign. Transportation from the Enron Building to The Center will be provided; however, if you prefer to drive yourself, we will send out directions a few days prior to the breakfast. Please RSVP to Zulie Flores at ext. 3-3908 or zulie.flores@enron.com by Thursday July 26.  Leadership giving solicitation officially begins on Monday, July 23, so look for an e-mail on Monday morning with more information about the overall campaign and how to make your pledge on-line. If you have any questions about the Alexis de Toqueville Society, or about this year's campaign, please contact Kathy Mayfield, Enron's United Way Campaign Coordinator, at 713-853-3264 or Kathy.Mayfield@enron.com.   At 49 Society members last year, Enron had the highest number of members in the city, and ranked nationally in the top 25 companies for total membership. We want to thank you for your generosity as this truly indicates how giving each of you are.   Your support is needed more than ever and is the key to surpassing our campaign goals for 2001. We look forward to seeing you at breakfast on the 31st.      <Embedded Picture (Metafile)>",shirley.crenshaw@enron.com,j.kaminski@enron.com,FW: Alexis de Tocqueville Breakfast and Solicitation,2001-07-23 12:35:52-07:00,sent

In all, we are lowering ratings on seven   companies, price targets on thirteen, and earnings   estimates on sixteen. * This follows our call (Power Curve 4, published   May 2) where we established a more cautious outlook   for Power Producers versus Energy Merchants. * Since our last Power Curve analysis on May 31, we   have seen the continued deterioration of both   forward power prices and spark spreads. * June was the first period in which we have seen   year/year declines in power prices and spark   spreads.  We had expected to see these signs first   in 1Q:02. * We maintain a bullish outlook on those companies   that are not leveraged to power prices, whether   through strong risk management skills or through a   lack of generation.  Our top two picks are ENE and   DYN.

June 2001  June 2000     % Change Power Prices ($/MWh)                     $50.21      $83.25       (40%) Spark Spread ($/MWh)                     $23.77      $56.93       (58%)  In our view, the most important measure for earnings, particularly for Power Producers, is the Spark Spread, which shows the gross margin potential for power generation in the spot market.  Hedging, trading, and the sale of other services such as capacity availability and spinning reserves offsets the impact of a decline in this number.  Most companies with generating capacity are at least 85% hedged for 2001, 60% hedged for 2002, and 40% hedged for 2003.  NEGATIVE QUARTERLY COMMODITY DRIVERS BEGINNING 3Q:01, TWO QUARTERS AHEAD OF EARLIER EXPECTATIONS  Forward power and gas markets suggest that 3Q:01 will be the first full quarter of negative commodity comparisons.  Earlier, in PC5, we had expected this would not occur until 1Q:02.  What has surprised us is the swiftness and breadth of the decline in the power pricing environment.  Unlike 2Q:01, which had two good months -- April and May -- to buoy earnings, forward markets suggest year/year declines in power prices and the spark spread for all of 3Q:01 and continuing into 4Q:01.  June is an important ""swing"" month in what is normally a relatively volatile earnings quarter.  So far, because of lower realized prices and a declining power price outlook, a number of companies have either pre- announced or guided to reduced earnings expectations, including:  PPL, PNW, PNM, NRG, KSE and CEG.  Quarterly Comparisons, Power Prices and Spark Spreads  DOWNGRADING STOCKS; DECLINING POWER PRICES ARE NOT GOOD FOR EARNINGS  In a declining power pricing environment, investors should take a more cautious stance on companies who are ""long"" the commodity -- i.e., companies who, because of their business model, are making a long bet on commodity prices. Within this constraint, we look for signs that mitigate this exposure. Furthermore, we are positive on the long-run case for aggressive companies who are building newer, more efficient power plants and replacing the aging plant that has built up under 70 years of regulation.  As long-run bets, companies such as Calpine (CPN, downgraded to 2H from 1H) offer an excellent play on deregulation, although we temper our outlook due to declining power prices. Certain other Power Producers are better positioned than others, and when we add the valuation component to this discussion (the stock prices of many Producers peaked in late April/early May), we think a number still offer attractive value.  However, our broad thrust is to recommend companies who are not long power (or have small exposure), whether because of strong trading and risk management skills or a lack of generating capacity.  In Power Curve 4 (5/1/01), when we first wrote about the declining price curve, we suggested a more cautious stance towards Power Producers versus Energy Merchants.  We stand by that advice.  We are downgrading the rating on only 1 Merchant vs. 4 Producers and Integrated Utilities who are exposed to power prices.  In terms of estimates, only 2 Merchants are being reduced, while we are reducing 14 Power Producers and Integrated Utilities.  Our top 3 growth-oriented picks for investors who want to avoid the impact of declining power prices are Energy Merchants ENE, DYN and ILA.  For dividend or total-return investors, we recommend Integrated Utilities EXC, ETR, and AEP.  MACRO VIEW:  WHY ARE POWER PRICES DECLINING?  Figure 1.  The Forward Power Curve ($/MWh) --U.S.              1998      1999      2000      2001F     2002F     2003F   $/MWh    $36.22    $40.53    $67.61    $73.44    $41.72    $36.81  The forward curve for power shows a rapid decline from peak levels achieved in 2000 and 2001E.  Rapid growth in construction of new generating capacity is the primary cause of the decline in forward price expectations (with the slowing economy an additional factor in the near-term).  See Figure 2.  Additionally, we cite two reasons why plant builds tend to over-shoot (either on the upside or the downside) changes in the demand for power.  These are because electricity is capital intensive and a commodity, each of which creates cycles of over- and under-development.  (1) Incremental Capacity Exceeds Incremental Demand.  The cause of the current decline in prices is the rapid addition of new generating capacity, in all regions of the country.  Additions to capacity are exceeding increases in demand for power, by a wide margin, in most regions.  This has caused the supply and demand balance to shift from a shortage to a growing surplus. Additional factors have hastened the decline in prices.  A slowing economy has reduced demand, as has the absence of last year's hotter-than-normal weather. So far this summer, weather has been approximately normal.  (2) Capacity additions exceeded incremental demand in 2000.  We think 2000 was the first year when incremental capacity exceeded incremental demand.  We still have an underlying power shortage, which has lasted well into 2001.  However, the market is adding capacity in a manner which should relentlessly lessen its severity and even potentially create over-capacity within the next several years. In 2000, 27,000 megawatts (MW) of capacity was added, up from 11,000 in 1999, and less than 10,000 MW during most of the 1990's.  We expect approximately 45,000 MW of capacity will be added in 2001, and a similar number in 2002.  Since this amount exceeds the amount required to meet growth in demand, we project a rising ""reserve margin.""  The reserve margin is the best fundamental indicator of the balance between supply and demand, with a high reserve margin indicating over-capacity (falling power prices), and a low reserve margin indicating under-capacity (rising power prices).  We tentatively project a bottoming of the electricity commodity price cycle in 2003, if enough developers scale back their plans to build new plants.  Figure 2. U.S. Capacity Additions and Reserve Margin                 1996  1997  1998   1999  2000P  2001E  2002E  2003E MW Additions   8,900 4,400 1,000 11,000 27,000 47,000 43,000 35,000 Reserve Margin  15%   13%   12%    10%    13%    16%    18%    18%  TWO REASONS FOR BOOM AND BUST CYCLES IN POWER  (1) Electricity is a cyclical commodity industry.  We have reached the peak of the ""first-ever"" cycle in the history of the industry.  We put ""first"" in quotes because we think the cycles were always there, except they were hidden by regulation.  With deregulation of the wholesale power market in 1996, market-clearing prices reveal the balance between supply and demand.  From 1996 until mid 2001, we were climbing the mountaintop of the electricity cycle.  Now we are on the downside.  (2) Electricity production is capital-intensive.  We think the cycles will last a number of years, 4-6 years in the current cycle (we put the first year as 1998, when enough liquidity existed in the newly deregulated market; we see the bottom as 2003), driven by the capital-intensive nature of the industry.  Power plants take a long time to build.  Planning decisions must be made between 1 and 5 years in advance of the actual day when power will be produced.  This is a much slower process than the market, and pricing expectations at the time of planning will have no doubt changed by the time plants are up-and-running.  We think it is difficult for individual company executives to fully anticipate the development plans of their competitors and, in the quest for market share, the tendency is to build in a manner which is often too aggressive when viewed on an industry-wide basis years later.  GUIDE TO INVESTORS:  INDUSTRY-LEVEL  TRACK THE SPARK SPREAD.   A primary metric for investors to track is the ""spark spread"".  The spark spread measures the difference between power prices (revenues) and natural gas prices (cost).  This is the critical metric for tracking earnings power of generating companies.  The gross margin of Power Producers in the spot market will be determined by the spark spread, and when these companies hedge, they will have to hedge using the forward spark spread available at that time.  Thus, a declining spark spread affects the earnings power of all companies, even those who are well hedged.  Only if they could hedge 100% would their earnings be unaffected by declining prices.  No company we are aware of has been able to hedge 100% of their output.  The forward spark spread actually suggests a worse commodity price environment in the 2002/3 period than existed in 1998/9, prior to the run-up in prices in 2000/1.  Figure 3. The Forward Spark Spread -- U.S.              1998      1999      2000      2001F     2002F     2003F   $/MWh    $21.36    $23.04    $41.28    $40.65    $14.15     $9.28  GUIDE TO INVESTORS:  COMPANY-LEVEL  STOCKS THAT CAN WEATHER THE STORM  The following factors will help companies weather the storm, from most to least importance:  Trading and risk management skills.  A strong trading desk acts as the ""eyes and ears"" to the market, often providing advance warning of changes in the commodity price outlook.  Companies with generating plant portfolios can use a strong trading desk to lock in power and gas prices earlier than their competitors.  The pure play Energy Merchants derive the bulk of their profits from trading and risk management activities, own little if any generating capacity, and are characterized by a commodity price-neutral earnings model. All of our Energy Merchants have trading and risk management skills that help their overall activity.  Our top pick and a pure play Energy Merchant is Enron (ENE-1H).  We do not see their earnings being affected by a declining price environment.  Other companies with strong trading/risk management operations include Dynegy (DYN-1H) and Aquila (ILA-1H).  Duke Energy (DUK-1H) and Mirant (MIR-1H) also have strong operations.  In terms of vulnerability to power prices, we think ENE and ILA have the strongest positions, owing to the lack or near-lack of generating capacity owned.  Contracting/hedging activity.  The more aggressive a company's moves were to lock in power prices earlier this year, the better positioned they are. Nevertheless, the unhedged portion of capacity can have a significant affect on earnings, particularly in the long-run.  We note that Calpine (CPN-2H), which we have downgraded to 2H from 1H, has aggressively stepped up its hedging activity in recent weeks, signing a 3,000 MW deal with Shell, a 1,000 MW deal with Reliant Resources (RRI-NR).  This activity appears to coincide with the rapid declines in the forward curve we have seen over the past two months.  Offsetting ""short"" positions.  This is a characteristic typical of electric utilities, who in many cases offset their long positions in generation with the short obligation to sell power to their customers.  Utilities that are well- positioned in this regard include:  EXC and AEP.  Utilities that are most vulnerable are those who have aggressively developed generating capacity in an effort to capture some of the earnings and growth visibility of the pure play Power Producers.  These include:  AYE, CEG, and PPL.  We are particularly concerned about companies that have invested in peaking capacity, or, separately, relatively inefficient plants that require a lot of capital dollars to upgrade.  These plants are often the ""marginal"" unit, providing earnings in tight pricing environments, but having significantly less value as prices decline.  Backlog of plant development.  We also think that companies with significant plant development backlogs can ""muscle"" their way through a weakened commodity price environment.  In particular, we note CPN, whose plants in operation grow as follows:  Figure 4. Calpine Earnings Metrics, 2000-2003E                           2000     2001     2002     2003       CAGR Y/E MW in operation     5,883   11,705   21,266   30,463        73% % of portfolio hedged             85%      71%      61% EPS                     $1.11    $1.95    $2.30    $3.00        39%  They have hedged aggressively their output from their plants, so even though future plants have lower margins, overall EPS growth can still be impressive. Nevertheless, we have also lowered our EPS estimates for CPN, reflecting the impact of lower spark spreads on the unhedged portion of output.  Our revised ""Outperform"" rating for CPN reflects the likely strong visibility of EPS growth over the 2000-2003 period.  SUMMARY OF RATINGS/ESTIMATES/PRICE TARGET CHANGES  REVISED VALUATION TABLE  RISKS TO OUR MORE CAUTIOUS STANCE  We see four principal risks to our more cautious stance.  Some horses are already out of the barn.  Power Producers and selected Energy Merchants (those with exposure to power prices) are down 26% since peaking on May 1.  Some of the risk of declining forward power prices is now reflected in the stocks.  However, we do not think all of the horses are out of the barn, and advise cautiously shutting the barn door on selected stocks at this time.  The next leg that could drive stocks downward is declining EPS estimates.  We think this is likely, particularly for 2002 and 2003, if power prices continue their decline.  We think when this happens, stocks are likely to go down further.  Hotter Weather.  So far in 2001, weather across the country has been near- normal vs. hotter-than-normal weather last year.  The year-on-year moderation has affected the forward curve.  Should August become hotter relative to last year, the forward curve could temporarily strengthen, boosting power price and earnings expectations near-term.  Ultimately, we think the principal cause of the decline in power prices is the dramatic build in power plants.  Even if the curve temporarily strengthens due to weather, we still expect it will be downward sloping for the next several years.  A Rebound in the Economy.  A weak economy has certainly affected power demand, which, in turn, has affected the forward curve.  When the economy eventually rebounds, which some are predicting by 4Q:01 or early 2002, the forward curve should strengthen.  We will watch for these signs and adjust our outlook accordingly.  Cancellations of plant development plans.  This factor is a wildcard for the group in our opinion.  We expect to see a number of weaker developers begin to cancel plant development plans.  So far, sources such as turbine manufacturer GE has not given any indication turbine orders are being canceled.  If/when they occur, the cancellation of development plans will have two effects. First, it will confirm the increasingly difficult industry environment, and would likely be perceived as negative.  Then, following the cancellation of enough development plans, it will sow the seeds for the recovery of power prices in the future.  This is why we think power prices will bottom in 2003. The mechanism for rebuilding the forward curve will, in part, be driven by cancellation of plant development plans and the restoration of a tighter supply-demand balance.  SUMMARY:  BECOMING MORE CAUTIOUS ON GROUP.  We are lowering ratings, price targets and/or estimates on 11 companies with exposure to the declining trend in power prices.  We advise investors to be more cautious on the group.  However, we continue to advise a shift toward Energy Merchants, who have little or no commodity price exposure, and away from Power Producers, who are long power, as well as those Integrated Utilities who are long power.  Additionally, we see several factors that also merit a cautious outlook, apart from the declining trend in power prices and its adverse effect on earnings:  (1) Utilities as a defensive play may become less valuable if the broad market begins to recover and/or tech stocks begin to outperform.  (2) Growth Energy stocks have benefited from strong earnings visibility at a time when many other S&P 500 sectors have ""rolled over.""  The resumption of earnings growth in any of these other sectors could draw growth capital away from our Growth Energy names, particularly if their earnings is now under challenge.

"FYI  Vince   -----Original Message----- From:  Lorenzo Pascual Caneiro <Lorenzo.Pascual.Caneiro@morganstanley.com>@ENRON [mailto:IMCEANOTES-Lorenzo+20Pascual+20Caneiro+20+3CLorenzo+2EPascual+2ECaneiro+40morganstanley+2Ecom+3E+40ENRON@ENRON.com]  Sent: Wednesday, July 25, 2001 12:46 PM To: vkamins@enron.com Subject: EPRM course  Dear Prof. Kaminski,  first of all, let me introduce myself. My name is Lorenzo Pascual and a collegue of mine and I attended the Energy Power Risk Management course that took place in London some weeks ago. About my CV, I have finished a Ph. D. in Mathematics (Statistics and Econometrics) at University Carlos III in Madrid (Spain), as well as a master degree in Mathematical Finance, both of them two months ago. In particular, in my dissertation I have developed new statistical techniques (using bootstrap methods) for forecasting returns and volatilities in the GARCH and Stochastic Volatility family of models. I have already one published article at the International Journal of Forecasting, and I have three more papers under revision in other international journals. Of course, if you are interested in this kind of research I can send to you a copy of the working papers. Since then, I work for Endesa Trading (spanish electricity company based in Madrid). However, at this moment I am based here in London for two years working in a joint venture with Morgan Stanley.  During the course I had the pleasure to talk with you and you gave me the opportunity of asking you some of the questions and doubts I have about energy derivatives. We did not have enough time to discuss anything deeply so, you asked me to send all the questions by email.  If you are in London, it would be for me a pleasure to meet you here for lunch some day and then we could talk much better about everything. If you can not, it will be ok to use the email.  I hope you can find some time to help me with this. Of course, I thank you very much in advance for your help because I understand you are very busy.  The main questions I need to be solved are the following:  1. This first question is very important because I want to know how to use Monte Carlo     methods for pricing all kind of options on the forward price when no analytical formula     is available. To understand the procedure I have compared the analytical formula with     the monte carlo results. For example, when the price follows the geometric brownian     motion I have programed the analytical     expression for a call on the forward price (see attached file in matlab: price_gbm.m)     (which corresponds with formula 6.5 in the book) together with     the monte carlo method proposed in your book with Clewlow and Strickland (chapter 7,     see attached file: price_gbmMC.m). In this case I achieve the same results. However,     if I try to do the same exercise when the underlying follows the simplest mean reversion     process (formula 6.6), I obtain very different results using formula (6.12) in the book (I think there     is a printing mistake on it) and the Monte Carlo techniques. I do not really understand     what might be happening. You suggested me to send to you the matlab files to check them     more carefully. The names are price_mr.m and price_mrMC.m for the analytical and monte     carlo respectively.      2. Could it be possible to have some of the data sets you use in the book to check if I achieve the         same estimated parameters with my programs ? (estimacion_mbg.m and estimacion_mr.m)      3.. Once you have estimated the unknown parameters from the data set, in          particular the speed of mean-reversion,          and, if you want to use the option formula under mean-reversion,          which is the value for this parameter          to introduce in the formula, the annualized one or not?  4. In case I have to use the annualized value into the pricing formula, I have a very important question which    is driving my crazy.    In the particular case of electricity price series, the estimated annualized speed of mean reversion I obtain are really very high,    and very far from zero. In this case, if you compare the pricing values obtained using the usual black formula    and the one obtained under mean-reversion, we achieve very different values. Is that correct? Did you have similar results    to mine when working with electricity series? (I computed these two values under the same volatility).  5. Going back to the previous point, why do we have to use the spot price volatility and not the forward volatility    in the pricing formula?    I do not understand why, since the underlying in this case is the forward price.  6. If I compute the speed of mean-reversion for the same data set, working with hourly data and with daily data (constructed    as the sample mean of the hourly observations) I obtain very different values for this parameter (for the annualized value). Is that normal?    Can be the different volatility values in these two series the reason  of that? Should not be both numbers very similar (the annualized ones of course)?  7. If the estimated numbers we obtain for the speed of mean-reversion have to be different depending on the time between observations,    has it sense the following question? : if the underlying of my product is a monthly forward price, should I compute    the speed of mean-reversion ( I mean the annualized value) with monthly spot prices?    In such a case, I expect to obtain a value closer to zero than in the     other cases (with hourly and daily data) and then, I will obtain a pricing value not as different    to that obtained with the usual Black formula.  8. Finally, can you give me references (papers, working papers,...) about who to value swing options ?  Thank you very much in advance. You can not imagine how much I appreciate your answers. Looking forward to hearing from you.  Best regards,  Lorenzo Pascual.   - estimacion_mr.m   - estimacion_mbg.m   - price_gbmMC.m   - price_gbm.m   - price_mrMC.m   - price_mr.m ",kenneth.deng@enron.com,j.kaminski@enron.com,FW: EPRM course,2001-07-25 13:02:45-07:00,sent
"Mike,  Perhaps it makes sense to shorten it a bit. I think the highlighted paragraphs can be removed. Makes no sense to sound too apologetic.  Another observation.

The first response I had when Christian proposed the arrangement was (and I quote myself) ""What does Paul think of the idea?""  Christian properly responded that the whole idea would be contingent on finding and training a replacement meteorologist for the Sydney office and getting your buy-in that the move would be good for Mother Enron in totality.  It was only with that understanding that any conversations along those lines proceeded.  Christian showed me the modelling progress he had made (Vince was out of town for this and thus unaware of it), but, quite frankly, I was very impressed with his achievements. I can see how he has become a valuable asset to your efforts.  The way we left the matter when Christian returned to Australia was that he would propose the subject to you for any further action.  Then, before I even had an opportunity to update Vince upon his return on my discussions with Christian, Christian called Vince to get his ideas on the subject (My hours aren't as conducive to Houston-Sydney phone link-ups, but Vince is here late into the night).   Vince's first and immediate reaction to the idea was to set up a telephone conference with you before even proceeding with the concept.  That is what somehow triggered the misunderstanding, but while at the same time, clarified what was happening and alerted you to the situation.    You have a great asset there in Christian, but be assured we're not poachers!  Hope this is the last beating the dead horse needs.  - Mike   !

" Norman,  Thanks for your message. I treat the Monday  meeting as the opportunity to introduce Enron to Prediction Company and to inform you about Enron's trading operation and especially about our electronic trading platforms. The exchange of information will hopefully lead to future  collaboration. We are especially interested in working with you on improving the algorithms that support our electronic market making functions (automatic adjustments of the price levels and/or bid-offer spreads to the changing market conditions). My group has currently a research project under way to explore the possibility of taking advantage of some recent developments in the market microstructure theory in our operations.  I think that we can definitely collaborate in the energy and other commodity markets and we can explore other possibilities as well. Given the exploratory character of the first meeting, it probably makes sense if Prediction Company  participation is limited to you and Jim. We shall, of course, be glad to meet with other associates that you may decide to bring to Houston with you. We shall be also glad to visit your company if we both decide to continue our discussions after the first meeting.  Enron side will be represented by Greg Whalley,  President & COO of Enron Wholesale Services, and myself. We expect John Lavorato, a member of EWS senior executive team, and my colleague from London, Dr. Steve Leppard, to join us.

Re. Scope:  We are particularly interested in hearing your vision of how Prediction Company might be able to contribute to your electronic market business.  In doing some background reading on the niche of electronic energy markets, we can imagine various roles we might play, but we need a more concrete vision from you to anchor our thoughts.  If you have other major issues to cover, you could let us know, and it might shape the roster of participants from our side.   Re. Participants:  On your side, Shirley has indicated two people, you and Greg Whalley (for at least part of the meeting?).  Definite participants from our side are: - Norman Packard (me) CEO. - Jim Nusbaum, CTO, also directing new business exploration.  We could consider bringing others, depending on where we expect the discussion to go, e.g. deeply into research issues or deeply into business issues.  Do you have a suggestion here?   Re. Agenda:  Agenda contributions from our side could be:  NP:  Overview of Prediction Company, history, business model, contractual situation, finances.  If desirable, I could also provide an overview of research.

""There is absolutely no change in that stance at present,"" sai= d an official. The Centre was inclined to play the role of facilitator only=  in arriving at a solution to the problem, and the central government's rep= resentative in the re-negotiation committee set up by the Maharashtra gover= nment had already been asked to expedite the proceedings, he said.

MSEB and IFIs sources told The Financial Express that the E= nron chairman Kenneth Lay's statement on Enron's desire to pull out of Dabh= ol project has not come as a rude shock, but as an expected one. However, t= hese sources said that if Enron wants to be out of 2,184 mw Dabhol project,=  their exist should take place after ""tough"" negotiations with an active in= volvement of the Union government.  They have projected various scenarios including the Enron, General Electric=  and Bechtel collectively agreeing to recover about 50 to 60 per cent of th= e total equity of $900 million in the Dabhol project from the Industrial De= velopment Bank of India, which is a rupee lender consortium leader. The MSE= B and IFIs are aware that the Enron and other equity holders will insist on=  the full capital recovery and that they will be quite keen on purchase of = their equity with interest at par by the new buyer. However, MSEB and IFIs sources are of the view that due to their hard barga= ining in the presence of the Centre, the Enron and other stakeholders may a= rrive at certain compromise so that they can recover a substantial amount b= locked in the project. Secondly, in view of cut in the equity, the loan amo= unting to over $1.2 billion could be restructured at the lower interest of = 12 per cent and that the moratorium period should be increased. Thirdly, th= e Centre will lend a financial support to its undertaking to pick up majori= ty equity and take over the Dabhol project, they feel. According to MSEB an= d IFIs, in another scenario, the state-run Gas Authority of India Ltd (Gail= ) and Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) should be asked to take over the liquifi= ed natural gas (LNG) project in a serious bid to cut the tariff. The per un= it tariff, which has been average at Rs 8.80, may come down to Rs 2.20 to R= s 2.40 per unit. The Dabhol Power Company is believed to have spent nearly = Rs 2,500 crore on the LNG project.  Moreover, the MSEB, which is at present doubtful over the fate of its equit= y of Rs 800 crore, may pick up 51 per cent equity and appeal to the Mumbai = based utilities Tata Power and BSES for taking up the balance equity in the=  Dabhol project. The MSEB and IFIs are keen that the impending issue be res= olved amicably, especially to avoid the legal battle in India and arbitrati= on in London. A section of MSEB is confident that the power purchase agreem= ent (PPA) on the issue of misdeclaration and default on the availability of=  power by DPC can be proved null and void and there will be no need for the=  payment of any compensation to DPC. This will enable the take over of Dabh= ol project by an Indian entity quite possible. Lay seems using pressure tac= tics Mr Lay's statement on Enron pull out is being seen in the political ci= rcle as a pressure tactic, especially when the Supreme Court is hearing the=  DPC's petition on August 6. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------= ---------------------------------------------------------------------------= ---------------------------------------------------------------------------= ------------- THE TIMES OF INDIA, Saturday, July 28, 2001 'Four states not to buy power at current rates'=20  Maharashtra deputy chief minister Chhagan Bhujbal said on Saturday that tho= ugh four states have expressed their willingness to purchase power from the=  Enron-promoted Dhabol power project they are not in a financial position t= o buy them at the prevailing tariff.

Referring to the offer of Karnataka, Delhi= , Madhya Pradesh and Punjab to buy power at a tariff as low as Rs 1.65 and = Rs 2.60, DPC said, ""unfortunately these are totally unrealistic proposals, = unattainable by new generation liquid plants, including those set up by the=  public sector"". On the other hand, after meeting DPC officials on Friday m= orning, Madhav Godbole told reporters that currently talks with DPC had rea= ched a stalemate with interested states quoting lower prices than the US en= ergy major's expectation. After discussions with four states and receiving = communications from Haryana and Rajasthan, he said that all these were read= y to draw DPC's 1,444 mw phase-II power at an average rate of Rs 2 to Rs 2.= 25 per unit. ""An overall demand for DPC power is at around 800 mw to 1,000 = mw, but not all of these is a base load one. Moreover, it is for more than = half a year, mainly non-monsoon months of November to May,"" Godbole said. H= e added that the states had informed the commission that each of them had a=  regulatory framework in the form of an electricity regulatory authority in=  place and was bound by a merit dispatch order, which did not allow them to=  buy costly power (like DPC's) so long as cheaper tariff was available in t= heir own state.( PTI ) ---------------------------------------------------------------------------= ---------------------------------------------------------------------------= ---------------------------------------------------------------------------= ------------- THE HINDU BUSINESSLINE, Saturday, 28 July 2001 Demand for DPC power only at `particular' price=20 =20 THE Godbole panel today conveyed the power-offtake proposals of six States = to Dabhol Power Company (DPC) officials. The company was told that there wa= s combined demand for 800-1000 MW power at not more than Rs 2.50 per unit. = ``One thing is abundantly clear. There is demand for (DPC) power at a parti= cular price. If the price increases the demand may not be large'' Dr Godbol= e told reporters. `` We have told Enron that the need for 800 to 1000 MW DP= C power is not at baseload, nor is it an all-year-round demand. The States = will require this power only between the months of April to November and th= e demand will fall during the rainy season,'' he said.=20  Karnataka, Punjab, Delhi and Madhya Pradesh made representations to the pan= el yesterday. Rajasthan and Haryana have presented written proposals asking=  for 300 and 100 MW each. While Madhya Pradesh has asked for power at Rs 1.= 65 per unit, other States have said they will not pay more than Rs 2.25 to = Rs 2.40 per unit. According to Dr Godbole, the company officials will ``tak= e up the matter with lenders and collaborators'' before the next meeting wh= ich is expected to be held in August. Meanwhile, according to DPC, the powe= r purchase proposals presented by various States ``are totally unrealistic = and unattainable by new generation liquid fuel plants including even those = in the public sector such as NTPC's Kayamkulam''. Dr Godbole had suggested = that DPC power ``at competitive rates'' could replace captive power in a nu= mber of States. He said though DPC had earlier agreed to reduce tariffs by = 50 paise, this would no longer be easy as the project has seen cost escalat= ion after stoppage of phase II work. `` Our dialogue with Enron is bogged d= own by two issues-- the plant load factor at which the unit is run and the = price of power,'' Dr Godbole said. He said there was a need to take a `` se= rious look at whether demand projections in the country are realistic''.=20 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------= ---------------------------------------------------------------------------= ---------------------------------------------------------------------------= ------------- THE ECONOMIC TIMES, Monday, July 30, 2001 Maharashtra to pay Rs 788cr penalty to MSEB, Girish Kuber=20 =20 MAHARASHTRA has decided to pay Rs 788 crore to the ailing Maharashtra State=  Electricity Board to compensate it for the damage it has caused the power = utility through tariff concessions to various sectors. Padmasinh Patil, the=  state's energy minister, had wanted to give tariff concessions to farmers,=  which was objected to by MSEB. Even the Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory=  Commission asked the state's energy department to restrain its generosity.=  The MERC had asked the government not to offer concessions at the cost of = its SEB and directed it to make a budgetary provision if it wanted to go ah= ead with its plan. Accordingly, Mr Patil announced last year that the state=  government will compensate the board. The MERC had set a deadline of Octob= er 2001 for sanctioning the compensation. The supplementary demand presente= d to the state assembly makes this provision. ""It has been decided to give = subsidy to MSEB to compensate the loss arising from supplying electricity a= t concessional rate to agricultural and powerloom consumers with effect fro= m May 1, 2000,"" said the demand by the state's finance ministry.=20  Currently, concessions of 55 per cent and 33.33 per cent in the electricity=  bills is given to powerloom and agricultural consumers. The total expendit= ure involved in the proposal is estimated to be around Rs 788 crore. The is= sue of offering concessions to powerloom and agriculture consumers has been=  hanging fire for the last couple of years. The board last year had raised = the tariff for agriculture and powerloom consumers which was opposed by the=  state government for obvious reasons. The government announced a roll-back=  of the tariff hike only to be prevented by the MERC from doing so. The MSE= B will now be charging Rs 600 per one horse power pump, bringing down the r= ate from Rs 1,400, and Rs 185 per loom down from the earlier rate of Rs 300= . The government has also decided to waive 55 per cent of the Rs 110 crore = unpaid dues from powerlooms. Delayed payment charges for the defaulters has=  also been waived and they have been granted three instalments for clearing=  old dues. According to MSEB's own admission, more than 118 lakh of the tot= al 130 lakh consumers are being supplied subsidised power.=20 ",vkaminski@aol.com,j.kaminski@enron.com,FW: From The Enron India Newsdesk - July 28 - 30 Newsclips,2001-07-30 13:31:37-07:00,sent

And systems administrators are taking no chances.  For those that do find the virus, which affects Windows NT and 2000 servers running Microsoft Internet Information Server (IIS), the easiest way to get rid of the problem is to reboot the infected machine. Because Code Red resides only in memory, it will be purged when the system shuts down. Once the system is rebooted, users should install a patch from Microsoft that fixes the vulnerability Code Red exploits. The proper patches can be downloaded from:  Windows NT Version 4.0: http://www.microsoft.com/Downloads/Release.asp?ReleaseID=30833  Windows 2000 Professional, Server and Advanced Server: http://www.microsoft.com/Downloads/Release.asp?ReleaseID=30800  Directions for installing the patch and other information on the virus is also available from Microsoft at: http://www.microsoft.com/technet/treeview/default.asp?url=/tech net/security/bulletin/MS01-033.asp  Anyone running IIS should install the patch listed above.  Bud Nelson, a reader of Network World's Security and Bug Patch Alert newsletter (http://www.nwfusion.com/newsletters/bug), says he found the virus on one of his extranet servers and followed the steps above to rid and protect his machine from future attack. But he adds, ""I am thinking about removing the network cable tonight.""  Greg Missman, owner of SecureTips.com, provides the following tip to make sure the patch from Microsoft is properly installed:  Look in your event log for an entry like this one (this is an NT IIS5 Enhanced log):  2001-07-20 21:22:03 216.68.15.61 - 120.195.68.58 80 GET /default.idaNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN NNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN NNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN NNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN%u9090%u6858%ucb d3%u7801%u9090%u6858%ucbd3%u7801%u9090%u6858%ucbd3%u7801%u9090% u9090%u8190%u00c3%u0003%u8b00%u531b%u53ff%u0078%u0000%u00=a 200 190  (Note: The line will be continuous in the log file.)  This means your IIS server logged a request for default.ida with the underrun data. If you look right after the data ends you will see a space and 2 sets of numbers.  ""200"" is the code for ""OK"" and ""190"" is the size in bytes sent to the remote host.  A ""200"" response on this request is very bad and means you either have not applied the patch or applied it wrong. Reapply it, then cut and paste the information from the log (everything after GET) into your own browser pointing it to your own site. You should get a ""414"" code after the request in your log stating that it errored and your server blocked it.  All the hype about Code Red could turn out to be just that - hype. But the steps for protection are relatively easy, and as the saying goes, ""Better safe than sorry.""  _______________________________________________________________ SUBSCRIPTION SERVICES  To subscribe or unsubscribe to any Network World e-mail newsletters, go to: http://www.nwwsubscribe.com/news/scripts/notprinteditnews.asp  To unsubscribe from promotional e-mail go to: http://www.nwwsubscribe.com/ep  To change your e-mail address, go to: http://www.nwwsubscribe.com/news/scripts/changeemail.asp  Subscription questions?

The early stag= es of my predicted warmer than normal August appear to be setting up as pla= nned. What seems to be in disagreement is where the hottest air sets up. It=  has been the Plains primarily this summer. The most recent runs of the Eur= opean and Navy models suggest that the hottest air especially relative to n= ormal shifts to the Lakes and NE as a monster of a ridge forms in the area.=  The Canadian and MRF models look more like a flat broad ridge East of the = Rockies which keeps the heat core West of the Mississippi. If any of these = verify close to reality, most all of the Eastern 3/4 of the country will be=  above normal anyway, but I like the large ridge idea, the European seems o= verdone. The pattern continues to be favorable for t! ropical activity, but=  something out in the tropics has to get cranked up first. The last couple = of years, most tropical activity has been recurved NE away from the U.S. du= e to a trough in the Atlantic. It currently is no where to be found, but at=  the moment, neither is the tropical activity.  Day 6: Sunday, August  5, 2= 001   Syncrasy's Choice:  Delta Temp.

Though we were there to discuss some models, Erik S. mentioned the meeting that Ed Ondarza had brought up with you.  According to Erik, Media Services would still like to have Research participate in the meeting.  He will let me know the exact date and time, however, it will be close to the date that you had discussed with me.  Media Services would like to have Research present an example where we had applied some novel and sophisticated analysis to a problem that may show applicability to issues in the advertising business.  Essentially, they would like a relevant success story with a great wow-factor.  Martin",martin.lin@enron.com,j.kaminski@enron.com,RE: meeting for Media Services,2001-07-31 14:52:15-07:00,sent

The first candidate is UT Finance Ph.D. student James Doran, who is confidentially re-evaluating his interest in the Ph.D. program.  James has done some consulting work with me in the energy area, and thus has some background in the field.  Although his quantitative/computing skills do not quite match those of Cantekin, I strongly believe they warrant an invitation for interview at Enron, and recommend you consider such an invitation affirmatively.

I have had occasion to work with Dave whilst he was director of quantitative analysis at Nucleus Corp. and have found him an MBA with good quantiative skills and excellent intuition.

"Joannie:  Thanks Here is the message for Jeff:    Jeff,  I am asking you on my behalf and on behalf of Rick Causey to make a keynote presentation at the annual Energy Finance Conference at the University of Texas at Austin. The conference is tentatively scheduled to take place on February 21 - 22, 2002. Depending on your calendar, the conference organizers can reserve a time slot for your presentation at the conference dinner (February 21, 2002, Thursday) or lunch (February 22, 2002, Friday).  This annual conference is devoted to financial engineering in the energy business. The topics covered in the past meetings  included applications of real options technology to the energy business, risk management and the future of deregulation. The agenda of the last conference is attached for your review; the agenda for the 2002 event is under development.   Given Enron's relationship with UT and our interest in the Energy Finance program,  a great source of highly skilled talent for our Analyst / Associate Program, we think that your participation will benefit the company. The conference is widely attended by senior executives of other energy companies and is an excellent forum to present Enron's accomplishments and the  agenda for the future.

Further to my discussions with Vince two weeks ago, I write you at this time in my capacity as Director of the Center for Energy Finance Education and Research (CEFER).  As we did in Feb.

The Conference will kick off with a dinner/keynote address Thur. evening, then continue all day Fri.  I would like to extend an invitation to Enron Corp.

I appreciate your kind offer to relay this invitation to Mr. Skilling's office for his consideration.  If at this stage he has timing constraints in the late Feb. - early March 2002 period, we would be happy to work around them in the scheduling of the Conference.

Lance and I have accepted and will be presenting two talks.  I think the same material might be useful for the Research Group at large (perhaps via Thursday staff meetings or Friday brownbags) and/or a few technical corner articles.  Topics would include a glossary of terms/jargon/acronyms, basic concepts (voltage, real and reactive power, transfer limits, loop flow), structure of the network (NERC regions, major hubs, etc), and congestion issues (TLR and FTR/TCC, examples of traditional bottlenecks).  If done in a series, we could also solicit questions for explanation at a subsequent talk (if not answered on the spot).  The talks for East Power are scheduled for Aug 7 and 21 at 3pm.  We could potentially have Research members attend the East Power sessions.  Would you like to have this done for Research and what forum would you prefer?

Skilling  Joannie:  Thanks Here is the message for Jeff:    Jeff,  I am asking you on my behalf and on behalf of Rick Causey to make a keynote presentation at the annual Energy Finance Conference at the University of Texas at Austin. The conference is tentatively scheduled to take place on February 21 - 22, 2002. Depending on your calendar, the conference organizers can reserve a time slot for your presentation at the conference dinner (February 21, 2002, Thursday) or lunch (February 22, 2002, Friday).  This annual conference is devoted to financial engineering in the energy business. The topics covered in the past meetings  included applications of real options technology to the energy business, risk management and the future of deregulation. The agenda of the last conference is attached for your review; the agenda for the 2002 event is under development.   Given Enron's relationship with UT and our interest in the Energy Finance program,  a great source of highly skilled talent for our Analyst / Associate Program, we think that your participation will benefit the company. The conference is widely attended by senior executives of other energy companies and is an excellent forum to present Enron's accomplishments and the  agenda for the future.

The October contract rose $0.107 to $3.232 per MMBtu. Tropica= l Storm Barry is expected to strengthen today and move into the north-centr= al Gulf of Mexico. Some weather forecasts expect that the storm will turn i= nto a hurricane, and the growing likelihood that workers will soon have to = be taken off Gulf of Mexico natural gas platforms has put traders on alert.=  But, despite the storm risk, there was only limited short-covering and vol= ume was fairly light. However, strength in crude and products as well as Tr= opical Storm Barry encouraged buying by both trade, commercial accounts and=  the locals. Fundamentally, the market is still bearish, but that could cha= nge quickly if the storm does impact production. Sell stops were triggered = as prices moved through the $3.20 level late in the session, bringing the m= arket off its highs. On Wednesday, the market dropped over $0.20 following = the release of AGA report data showing an injection of 77 Bcf last week. Ho= t weather is forecast for much of the nation early next week, with the West=  Coast returning to hot weather next week. Natural gas for next day deliver= y across the US and Canada was generally $0.10 to $0.15 per MMBtu lower yes= terday, except out West where spot price climbed. Natural gas for next day = delivery at the Henry hub lost $0.17 to $3.15 per MMBtu.

The storm is most likely=  to make landfall on Sunday in Louisiana. Companies with offshore productio= n have already taken steps to protect workers by moving them onshore until = the storm passes but they added that they had not yet suspended any product= ion. The National Hurricane Center forecasters predicts that Barry would mo= ve slowly to the northwest, taking it through the main producing areas of t= he central Gulf with a 55% chance that it would attain hurricane strength a= s it heads toward New Orleans. Chevron has evacuated 700 workers from offsh= ore platforms as a precaution against the storm and will make further evacu= ations today. The Gulf of Mexico provides about one quarter of nation's pro= duction of both natural gas and crude oil; about 13 Bcf of natural gas per = day and 1.4 million barrels of oil.=20 --------------------------------------------------------               JUST COMPLETED - AVAILABLE NOW              NORTHEAST U.S. AND EASTERN CANADA Ziff Energy Group's Multi-Client Study: Beyond the Midwest: Focusing on the Northeast Opportunities!

Public utilities which are loca= ted in competitive markets would no longer be bound by existing tax law str= ictly limiting private use of facilities financed with tax-exempt bonds. Ho= wever, they can continue to issue tax exempt financing for a limited amount=  of generation to serve their own load, but not for service outside their l= ocal area. Private and public utilities say they are satisfied with the bil= l, nut private utilities are disappointed that the bill left out a provisio= n eliminating taxes on contributions in aid of construction. The bill inclu= des measures that allow public power systems to join RTOs in order to impro= ve the national transmission grid, without endangering outstanding bonds. T= he bill also makes an exception for prepaid natural gas contracts, which wo= uld apply only if at least 85% of the purchased volumes were for use by gov= ernmental utilities in the state where the bond issuer was located.=20 --------------------------------------------------------  PNW 2001: Current Realities, Future Expectations Pacific Northwest Gas Strategies Conference October 2,2001 Portland,Oregon (at the Hilton Portland) Hear Commissioner Wilson Condon, State of Alaska, describe how Alaska gas s= upply will energize the Pacific Northwest supply portfolio.

The California PUC claims that El Paso unfairly award= ed 1.2 Bcf per day of firm capacity to its affiliate, El Paso Merchant Ener= gy. Before the start of testimony, the FERC ALJ said that an April 2000 mem= orandum sent between Wise and another  official relates the minute details = of everything that is happening in the company, showing that Mr. Wise was w= ell aware of everything. That seems to run contrary to Wise's testimony at = the previous May  hearing, where testified he did not micromanage the affai= rs of El Paso's subsidiaries. The California PUC testified that El Paso awa= rded the capacity in question by skewing the rules of an open season, sayin= g it biased the open season in favor of the 'total package' bid. If a singl= e bid for all of the capacity exceeded $37.5 million, then individual bids = could only succeed if they exceeded the value of the total package bid to E= l Paso.  Therefore, even if they submitted partial package bids at reasonab= ly high rates, their success was totally dependent upon the other partial p= ackage bids by other shippers. A total of 24 shippers submitted partial bid= s, and none of them were awarded any capacity, the PUC said. But El Paso di= sputed those claims, saying that it made the minimum economic criteria befo= re the open season, thus giving no one an advantage.=20 --------------------------------------------------------                   YOU DESIGNED IT.

The Ladyfern are= a, located in an isolated section of northeastern British Columbia, is esti= mated to contain up to 1 Tcf. Murphy Oil and Apache jointly drilled the fir= st discovery well in the region a year ago, which is about 60 miles northea= st of the oil hub, Fort St. John, BC. Acreage in the Ladyfern region has so= ld for 17 times the median paid for acreage in other parts of BC. It is lik= ely second in size to the 1.8 Tcf Caroline, Alberta field in terms of Canad= ian onshore discoveries. Production is estimated at 480 MMcf per day. Canad= ian Natural is now producing 55 MMcf per day from one well, which is restri= cted by pipeline capacity. It expects to be producing 200 MMcf per day by t= he end of the year.

"Sheridan,  I am aware of the duplicate check problem and I owe you phone call  about this. I am still trying to mobilize internal support for the valuation  study we discussed at San Antonio. Mark Ruane whom you met, moved on to a new job and his successor is a bit skeptical about the need for a study. Internal Enron  perception is that we understand the process of decision making inside big  financial institutions (or lack of it), especially in the energy area, regarding valuation of investment projects. Any study would just reveal what we already understand about quite simplistic tools they use: DCF with a discount rate being subject to negotiations within a very broad band of potential values.  It will help if I get the agenda of the conference  soon to pass it on to Jeff Skilling. It would also help if you could write a formal letter to him.

By the way, Shirley may have mentioned to you that I somehow received two checks for the work I did last spring.  I went off to Hong Kong this summer and didn't follow up on this other than to mention it to Shirley before I left. (I just got back last Friday.) Shirley left me a phone message to mail the check back to her.  If you can email Shirley's last name and mailing address to me I'll send her the check.  Also, if you are interested in having me do some work on the valuation issues we discussed at the Texas Finance Festival please let me know.  One more thing:  The university that I'm affliliated with in Hong Kong (HKUST) just hired a new president, Paul Chu, who is from Houston and has some sort of relationship with Ken Lay.  The Dean at the HKUST business school mentioned that Paul Chu was meeting with Ken Lay this summer and would discuss possible avenues of collaboration.

"Greg,  A short summary of the proposed modes of cooperation with Prediction Company. More detailed notes by Steve are attached.  I. Major potential projects (in the order they suggested it).   1. Prediction Company develops a P&L attribution system (allocation of P&L to different market  factors, like spreads, volume, trader's skills, etc.). Trader's performance evaluation system.   2. Decision support system: a model recommending transactions to a trader without  full trade automation.   3. Fully automated trading system, setting prices and executing trades on an electronic trading platform.   Any project would require review of the market data provided by Enron.  (Is it a  free option for them? -  VK)   II. Financial arrangements. Combination of a number of different forms of equity participation, direct payments     per project, and   fees per transaction.   1. Equity investment would reduce fees and payments. For Prediction Company, this is a preferred form of       Enron's participation.   2. Payment per project that would look like consulting fees. They would like a lump-sum payment      first (to expand the staff), followed by consulting fees later.    3. Next to equity investment, they would like to see a constant income stream through      fees charged per transaction. My comment: in case they design a decision support      tool, it will be difficult to come up with a per transaction fee. It will be difficult to identify      decisions that can be attributed exclusively to their system.   Recommendations:   1. A visit to Santa Fe with Kevin Garland to discuss an equity investment.   2. I shall try to dig up more information about the company and the relationship                 with UBS.   3. We should  come up with a solution that will help to transfer skills to Enron from      Prediction Company.

Sep. 10th is indeed feasible.  I scheduled the invitation dates of 9/24 - 10/17 to give me time to make progress in my class presentations so that students would have more of a background in listening to Vince's presentation.  If select the 9/10 date, I would ask Vince to take into account in the level of his presentation that by that date the students will only have had 6 hrs. of the Foundations of Energy Finance class (classes begin 8/29 and Labor Day intervenes).  On the plus side, the students do come in with three finance courses (core course, investments, advanced corporate) as prerequisites to my class.  In sum, I appreciate the importance of recruiting and can accommodate Vince's presentation Sep. 10th.  Please advise if Vince would like the 2 1/2 hr. (2 to 5 p.m., including breaks) time slot, or the 75-min. subset thereof.  >Perhaps we could arrange lunch or dinner the day of the presentation >for yourself and our 5 summer associate interns.

Vince   -----Original Message----- From:  ""Ed Krapels"" <ekrapels@esaibos.com>@ENRON [mailto:IMCEANOTES-+22Ed+20Krapels+22+20+3Cekrapels+40esaibos+2Ecom+3E+40ENRON@ENRON.com]  Sent: Tuesday, August 07, 2001 5:28 AM To: Vincent Kaminski \(E-mail\) Subject: Neptune  Dear Vince,  As you may know, FERC approved the Neptune transmission proposal on July 26 and the organizers (me among them) are now preparing to hold on open season starting September 10 to sell 80 percent of the capacity on a firm basis. A diagram of the system legs is on www.NeptuneRTS.com.  Some of the bidders in that open season will be gencos with little or no experience in trading, some will be load-serving entities, some will be power marketers.  There is likely to be interest in a Neptune hedge, and I wondered how we could engage Enron in an exploration of its willingness to provide such hedges. Essentially, bidders will be going long the various spreads (Nova Scotia - New York, New Brunswick - Boston, PSE&G - Zone J, etc etc) and we would like to encourage someone like Enron (I know there is no one quite like Enron but you know what I mean) to be willing to offer transmission hedges.  It may also interest you that FERC gave Neptune approval to hold 20 percent of the capacity for sale in the short-term markets. We (the development group) see that as a desirable exposure to these spreads for Neptune's equity investors and are in the equity markets now securing a second tranche of development capital, and will return in early 2002 for a sizeable amount of permanent equity assuming the bids received in September - October yield sufficient interest to finance the majority of the project in the debt market.  That's the plan, the primary virtue of which is that the authorities have allowed us to put it to a market test this fall. Let me know if you'd like to pursue this. I will make similar initiatives to several other entities later this week.  Ed    Edward N.

To simplify the process of negotiating these diffs, we have established 4 classes of crude and picked a marker for each group. We need to come up with our offer for each of these markers (vs Calendar Nymex WTI) on a delivered basis. The crude classes and marker for each are as follows:  Class  Marker Crude  Light Sweet Domestic Sweet Heavy Sweet Cabinda Light Sour Basrah Light Heavy Sour Maya  These were chosen based on an assumption that they are the most liquid grades for each class. We could probably use Mesa 30 instead of Bas Lt for the Lt Sour. Pat, if you want to do that just please call Quinn to make sure it works for him. Your call on what you think is the most liquid.  Once we have an offer for each of the markers, we will then set net diffs for all the other crudes by using a relative refining value of each grade relative to it's marker (and add the RV diff to the marker delivered diff). This will avoid us having to derive a forward market-based offer for each grade, using RRV instead. It will also establish diffs at which the refy will be indifferent on which grade is supplied. The preliminary list of approved crudes and their class are listed on the attached spreadsheet. (Please let me know if you want to add any crudes.)  I need your help with the following:  1) Work up an ""FOB"" offer for each grade on an 8 year basis, and assuming approximate size of 25MBD for each grade. It might be good to see if Jen's group can help with a fundamental angle on value for these grades (pls work through John if you want this as he has been asked to coordinate the Oz/Fraser connection).  2) We will work with you to structure net delivered numbers to the refinery. There are a number of costs that will need to get loaded into the bridge cost. Yolanda is verifying w/ops a lot of bridge costs that we got from Farmland. Pat or Don, please also feel free to look at the list (Yolanda has) and let us know if you have any comments. In add'n to those costs, we will need to add: a) backwardation between your FOB price basis and Cal Nymex, b) time value of money, c) linefill costs, d) tank rental costs (Fland rents breakout/blending tanks at Cush), e) Brent/WTI on Bas Lt and Cabinda, f) Freight (Joe - I am assuming you will make a market for the crude guys on the cargo movements - the WS rates on the attd sheet are out of date but you may find the template handy).   I NEED TO HAVE YOUR FOB OFFERS AND FREIGHT BY FIRST THING MONDAY PLEASE.  We will then circle up and work into the net number with you (let you check our spreadsheet for del'd costs).

We met in Hawaii conference and I promised to send the paper that I presented there to you. This paper is now enclosed and I hope you find the model useful, at least in the future.  In this bandwidth area I'm working closely with my friends (EigenValue Ltd.) and they've office in my home country Finland. In the electricity market I've been consulting few electricity companies in Scandinavia and it seems that the market there is working pretty well. I also added one paper in this field.  In Hawaii you told me something about your interests in Revenue Management models. Fortunately, one of my friend, Costis Maglaras (Professor in Columbia Business School, c.maglaras@columbia.edu), is working in this area and he would be very happy to talk with you about the implementation of these models into everyday industry practice.  If you are interested I'd very much like to visit Enron and give a talk there. Especially, I'd like to learn more about your company, the reputation of Enron is impressive!

Event risk is synonymous with  ""fat tails"" or ""jump risk"". Event risk is one component of  ""specific risk"", defined by bank supervisors as the component of  market risk not driven by market-wide shocks. Standard  Value-at-Risk (VaR) models used by banks to measure market risk  do not do a good job of capturing event risk. In this paper, I  discuss the issues involved in incorporating event risk into  VaR. To illustrate these issues, I develop a VaR model that  incorporates event risk, which I call the Jump-VaR model. The  Jump-VaR model uses any standard VaR model to handle ""ordinary""  price fluctuations and grafts on a simple model of price jumps.  The effect is to ""fatten"" the tails of the distribution of  portfolio returns that is used to estimate VaR, thus increasing  VaR. I note that regulatory capital could rise or fall when  jumps are added, since the increase in VaR would be offset by a  decline in the regulatory capital multiplier on specific risk  from 4 to 3. In an empirical application, I use the Jump-VaR  model to compute VaR for two equity portfolios. I note that, in  practice, special attention must be paid to the issues of  correlated jumps and double-counting of jumps. As expected, the  estimates of VaR increase when jumps are added. In some cases,  the increases are substantial. As expected, VaR increases by  more for the portfolio with more specific risk.   Keywords: Specific risk, market risk, jump risk, jump  diffusion, default risk   JEL Classification: G10, G28  John D. Martin Carr P.

We wi= ll continue to the follow the progress and keep you updated.=20  Summary: Direct access was designed to break utility monopolies and was a key compon= ent of California's 1996 deregulation law.  Under this concept, all custome= rs could directly access an energy provider other than their regulated util= ity.  The debate over direct access is at the heart of a complicated attemp= t to solve California's costly power crisis.  It will determine whether bus= inesses, with residential customers, pay for the bulk of the state's future=  energy purchases. It also could determine whether Southern California Edis= on, the state's cash-strapped No. 2 utility, will avoid bankruptcy, and whe= ther deregulation will survive in any form.  Big businesses, free-market advocates and alternative energy providers have=  lobbied state legislators to find a way to keep so-called ""direct access"".=   Now, as the state prepares to sell $13.4 billion in bonds to begin paying=  off its debt, legislators and energy officials say they must prevent big b= usinesses from wiggling out of that obligation by closing off their direct-= access escape route.  Regulators are concerned that if businesses flee the = system, the state will be stuck with too much electricity under long-term e= lectricity contracts through 2021.  That would mean residential ratepayers = would be stuck paying the bulk of the $43 billion in future power costs, a = point that has enraged consumer groups.  Currently, only about 88,000 custo= mers buy their energy through direct access (per CEC statistics), including=  about 10,000 large commercial/industrial customers, and about 78,000 resid= ences.  Alternative service providers shifted most of their customers back = to California's primary utility suppliers (SoCal Ed., PG&E, SDG&E) earlier = this year when prices skyrocketed and they could no longer compete with uti= lity rates capped by the Legislature. =20  California legislators argue that direct access is the keystone of the late= st Edison bailout plan, sponsored by Assembly Speaker Pro Tem Fred Keeley. = Under the plan, the 3,600 largest businesses would agree to pay $3.1 billio= n of Edison's debts over 15 years.  In exchange, businesses would be allowe= d to secure their own power contracts by 2003, but not without first paying=  an ""exit fee.""  The fees and which parties would be exempt remain undeterm= ined, however, they would include a surcharge or a complicated calculation = in which businesses would pay a percentage of future energy purchases.  It = is likely that whatever compromise legislators are able to reach regarding = direct access, California's business community will have extreme difficulty=  accepting the terms.  To ensure their efforts at resolving the direct access dilemma and abate fe= ars of a collapsing state budget, lawmakers have gone so far as to introduc= e two bills, (one sponsored by Sen. Bowen and defeated in July, and a secon= d by Assemblyman Dave Kelley,) that would rescind language in previous legi= slation that authorized the Public Utilities Commission to block direct acc= ess.  The California PUC has thus far stayed a decision on the matter, but = is expected to rule by August 23rd.  Complicating the issue is Wall Street.  The state's bankers, led by J.P Mor= gan, are nervous about selling as much as $13.4 billion in planned state bo= nds if businesses (currently the largest ratepayers in the state, after gov= ernments) find a way out of the system.  The bonds are meant to repay the s= tate for $8.2 billion in power-buying costs so far this year and to cover s= ome future costs.  Business and residential electricity customers would rep= ay the bonds through a surcharge on their utility bills.  If businesses wer= e allowed to sign on with outside energy providers, that revenue stream wou= ld be in jeopardy.",vkaminski@aol.com,j.kaminski@enron.com,FW: Direct Access 8/10/01,2001-08-13 07:03:39-07:00,sent

I reviewed business plans and participated as a judge, along with Barbara Page from (then) Enron Investment Partners. Paul LeBeau and I have discussed the experience and my cost/benefit analysis of the experience with regard to Enron.  He and his group will decide whether to invest in this for 2002.

Thought you would enjoy this!   There were these two elderly people living in a  Florida  mobile home park. He was a widower and she a widow.  They had known  one another for a number of years.   Now, one evening there was a community  supper in the big  activity center. These two were at the same table, across   from one another. As the meal went on, he made a few admiring  glances at  her and finally gathered up his courage to ask her,  ""Will you marry  me?""   After about six seconds of 'careful consideration,' she answered.  ""Yes. Yes, I will.""   The meal ended and with a few more pleasant exchanges, they  went to their respective places.   Next  morning, he was troubled. ""Did she say 'yes' or did she  say 'no'?"" He  couldn't remember. Try as he would, he just  could not recall.    Not even a faint memory.   With trepidation, he went to the telephone and called  her.  First, he explained to her that he didn't remember as well as  he used  to. Then he reviewed the lovely evening past.     As  he gained a little more  courage, he then enquired of her, ""When  I asked if you would marry me, did  you say 'Yes' or did you  say 'No'?""   He was delighted to hear her say,  ""Why, I said, 'Yes, yes I will'  and I meant it with all my heart."" Then she  continued, ""And I  am so glad that you called, because I couldn't remember  who had  asked me.""

About 95% of installed capacity in Brazil is hydro (out of about 65 GW) and the level of water in the reservoirs  is about 20% of the normal. We have a huge exposure in Brazil given our LDC investments and merchant power plants.  Measuring water level in the reservoirs is a critical project and boys from Brazil  are asking for help. We have looked into a similar problem in Norway and came up with interesting technical solutions but had to drop it because of lawyers' objections. These objections may not apply to Brazil.

"Dear Vince J Kaminski,  As a Mathematical Trading and Finance MSc student (City University London) I am writing my dissertation on ""power forward curves"".  Since you have participated in the writing of the book ""Managing Energy Price"" I was wondering if you could eventually help me. The MRHV model seams to be the best econometric one to model the electricity forward curve.  I understand and know how to work out with the classic Mean Reverting Process, but I don't understand the MRHV (I don't know the discretised form and I cannot even find any paper, or article on it) and how to get rid of the exponent to estimate my parameters (long-run mean, Speed of mean reversion, volatility, exponent, Floor price).

Greetings Vince! =09During the brief idle moments we have here in the lab, I have been ponde= ring yet another possible project.  We have built sensor boards and written=  programs to calculate the current flow along High Voltage Direct Current l= ines, the type that form the Western Inter-tie.    There are six of these l= ines to the west, i.e. to the WSCC  - four between WSCC and MAPP and two be= tween WSCC and SPP.  It would seem to me to be valuable to know when there = there power supply differences between these NERC regions and when power wa= s flowing between them.  (In this case, directionality is no problem.  For = once there is actually something flowing!)  Of course if this is useful, th= e project could expand to other inter-regional zones.  HVDC lines exist in = the northeast between the large Canadian hydro projects and the metropolita= n cities in New England.  Globally, there are several large grids being for= med - one in Scandinavia, one in North Africa, an East Russian/Chinese syst= em and a Russian/Korean/Japanese system.  Naturally these have to connect i= nternally with DC lines as there are power frequency, power reliability and=  power control differences between each of the generating countries. =09You are the first person that I have told about this.

I believe this would considerably help in coming up with ideas about how to analyse the EOL database, as well as providing some initial experience in the use of data mining tools and techniques. I found several possible courses that could prove valuable in this regard, and some of these are listed below. The first of these was recommended by Eric (Cope), and is the earliest of the courses that I could find, so I will plan on registering for it unless there is good reason not to.  1.

(http://www-stat.stanford.edu/~hastie/MRC/mrc.general.html) 2. ""How to Successfully Mine Data"" - Dr. Richard De Veaux and Herbert Edelstein (Two Crows Corporation); to be held in Bethesda, Maryland, October 8-9, 2001; Cost = $1,195. (http://www.twocrows.com/dmcourse.htm) 3. ""Statistical Data Mining"" - Dr. Brian D. Ripley (University of Oxford, sponsored by Insightful); to be held in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, October 15-16, 2001; Cost = $1,800. (http://www.insightful.com/train/ripley.htm) 4. ""Tools for Discovering Patterns in Data: A Survey of Modern Data Mining Algorithms"" - John Elder (of Elder Research); to be held in Charlottesville, Virginia, October 16-17, 2001; Cost = $1,195. (http://www.datamininglab.com/newcourse.html) 5. ""DATA MINING: LEVEL I - An intensive introduction to methods, applications and resources"" - Tony Rathburn (The Modeling Agency); to be held in Dallas, Texas, November 27-28, 2001; Cost = $1,095.

I have established contact with the senior commissioning editor for Wiley, who is interested in working with us to publish something like our joint Risk publication (Managing Energy Price Risk), as well as a similar title on metals.  I'm due to go on holiday from tomorrow for a couple of weeks.  Would you be interested in following up with her, or should I continue when I return from my break? (Vince - Something you may not be aware of is that I'm moving over to trade oil derivatives when I return from my holiday for Niamh Clarke/John Nowlan.)

I enjoyed our meeting and found it most informative - thanks for the tour of the various trading floors.  As discussed, I would be most interested in pursuing a book on metals trading, and more broadly, various books on the quantitative aspects of energy trading (& related commodities). Wiley is renowned for the depth and breadth of its finance publishing and, in particular, well-respected for the more quantitative part of our finance list.  Such titles include Rebonato's 'Interest Rate Option Models'; Willmott's 'Paul Willmott on Quantitative Finance'; Taleb 'Dynamic Hedging'; Saunders 'Credit Risk Measurement'; James/Webber 'Interest Rate Modelling'; Caouette et al 'Managing Credit Risk'; Carol Alexander's 'Risk Management' and so on. One area that we are interesting in publishing in is in the area of energy, in its broadest sense.  Enron is obviously a key player in this market, and we would certainly welcome exploring various options in terms of publishing books with Enron, Enron employees or as part of a collaboration with various industry players.  Wiley is a publisher with an international reputation.  Within finance we commission product from the US, Europe and Asia, under the Wiley Finance umbrella.  A key part of our publishing strategy is to present our titles as a seamless whole, with global sales, marketing and distribution.  Our various sales channels include teams dedicated to servicing the needs of the booktrade; online accounts; corporates; libraries, universities and the increasing number of e-content providers (e.g. NetLibrary; Fat Brain etc.)  Topics of interest that initially spring to mind include:    Managing Metals Price Risk    Managing Energy Price Risk    Weather Risk Management    Books on trading, risk management etc. for specific commodities    (broadband; electricity, natural gas, oil etc.)  When we met you discussed the possibility of putting together a book proposal on metals, with your team at Enron.  I very much hope that you decide to pursue this further.  For your information, I have attached our standard new book proposal form below, as a guideline.  Finally, you also planned on speaking with Vince Kaminski about other publishing opportunities and book ideas.  I would be more than happy to follow up with Vince myself if you thought this appropriate.  Once again, thanks for your time last Thursday. I very much look forward to hearing from you.

A statement of the purpose and main features of the proposed book - its raison d'etre. (e.g. why the need for such a book; size of market; inclusion of case studies and so on). 2.  A note of the specific types of readership the book would attract, and why.  For example, a definition of the type of practitioner who would be interested in the book, including job titles. 3.  Notes comparing the nearest existing books which might be thought related or competitive.  How would your book differ? 4.

You can take a quick look at the book published by Risk magazine, ""Managing Energy Price Risk"", 2nd edition. This collection of papers was probably the best selling book Risk published so far.

I believe this would considerably help in coming up with ideas about how to analyse the EOL database, as well as providing some initial experience in the use of data mining tools and techniques. I found several possible courses that could prove valuable in this regard, and some of these are listed below. The first of these was recommended by Eric (Cope), and is the earliest of the courses that I could find, so I will plan on registering for it unless there is good reason not to.  1.

"Vince:  I read the relibaility-based VAR method document with interest.  Here are some comments:  1. The document falls short of describing how to use the method in practice, but rather gives some general motivation. I am confident that I myself could not develop an algorithm based on this document, unless all of the derivative valuation functions are explicit (and rather nice) functions with explicit derivatives of the underlying variables, in which case the VAR problem is not so hard in any case, as Monte Carlo is very effective in this case. (My comment here is critical of exposition. I do not suggest that the proposed method is weak!)  2. The remark (p. 2) that my paper with Jun Pan addresses only normal returns is not correct. The main point of our paper was to allow for jumps, including fat tails and skewness. The comment that we rely on delta-gamma is a good criticism,and the main potential advantage of the reliability approach, if it works in practical cases.  3. There is a typo at page 2, at 9 lines from the bottom, where I presume g(T(u)), not g(T(x))  4. There is a missing `we' on page 5, 9 lines from the bottom.  5. The remark on CPU time (page 7) does not mention what machine was used.  6. The example (page 8) does not really have much non-normality. Skewness=0, and kurtosis (4) (is this excess kurtosis?) are not much compared to most practical cases, in which kurtosis is an extra order of magnitude, with lots of skewness.   Overall, the paper piqued my curiosity a lot, and left me wanting more clarity, and a cookbook.   I hope `events' at Enron have not made things difficult for you.

ExxonMobil, Shell,= =20 and Chevron have all missed output targets, despite the incentive of two=20 years of high oil prices. ExxonMobil planned a 3% annual growth target last= =20 year but its output for the second quarter of 2001 was flat versus a year= =20 ago. Shell reported that its 2nd quarter production increased by only 1%,= =20 well short of the 5% target. Depletion from existing oil fields runs at an= =20 average rate of about 5% per year, and that has to be replaced by an=20 equivalent amount of new production just to keep output steady. From 1998 t= o=20 2000 the six biggest publicly traded companies largely failed to replace th= e=20 oil and natural gas they produced with new reserves, after stripping out th= e=20 effect of acquisitions and revisions, according to Andersen management=20 consulting. BP posted one of the best performances, replacing 200% of its= =20 natural gas production and 86% of its oil. Shell replaced only 42% of its= =20 natural gas and 55% of its oil, according to Andersen. BP has set the most= =20 ambitious production growth target of 5.5% for this year up 7% for the long= er=20 term. =20 From http://www.enerfax.com (Sunday, August 19, 2001): =20 Natural Gas Futures Dip Lower     Natural gas futures for September delivery on the NYMEX dipped $0.064 l= ower Friday to $3.303 per MMBtu as traders squared short positions now that=  Tropical Storm Chantal will miss the GulfCoast. The October contract lost = $0.081 to $3.334 per MMBtu. Tropical Storm Chantal will affect the YucatanP= eninsulaearly this week and then move into the central Gulf but is a noneve= nt. Some traders wanted their positions cleared in preparation for next wee= k's AGA storage report as they do not trust last week's reported build of j= ust 3 Bcf, and believe that the AGA may report a higher build this week to = compensate. A lot of traders got burned by last week's report and are begin= ning to doubt the whole system. But, others look at the data as just a one-= week blip brought about by a crescendo of events that no longer exist and d= o represent not a long-term shift. However, if Wednesday's AGA injection is=  low again this week, look for the market to rally to a higher level, but i= n the meantime it will be controlled by the storm entering the Gulf of Mexi= co. Look for support in the $3.15-$3.20 range and again at $3.00. Resistanc= e is pegged at $3.40 and again around $3.60. Natural gas for next day deliv= ery across the USand Canadawas generally $0.10 - $0.20 lower Friday. Natura= l gas for next day delivery at the Henry hub dropped $0.20 to $3.24 per MMB= tu. =20 Gulf South Hold Open Season for Gulf Pines Pipeline=20    =20     Gulf South Pipeline is planning to build a pipeline extending from Mobi= leBayto North Carolinaif it receives enough interest. An open season for ca= pacity on the Gulf Pines Pipeline is being currently being held. Gulf South=  Pipeline, formerly Koch Gateway Pipeline, is owned by Entergy-Koch. If com= pleted, Gulf Pines would be 600 - 700 miles long, and would extend through = Georgia, South Carolinaand North Carolina. Anticipating an in-service date = of summer 2004, Gulf South is soliciting binding and non-binding bids for c= apacity on Gulf Pines through September 19th. The pipeline would offer an i= nterconnection with Gulf South near MobileBay, allowing customers to source=  supply from Texasand Louisianaas well as from MobileBay. The Gulf South sy= stem also offers links to major storage and supply hubs. =20 Gas Daily reports this proposed pipeline may have a capacity of 1 bcf per d= ay.  It also gives the following website for additional information:  http:= //www.gulfpinespipeline.com . =20 Natural Gas Market Ponders Storage Report  =20     While some were questioning the accuracy of this week's astonishingly l= ow natural gas storage report, others blamed Tropical Storm Barry and highe= r demands from new power generation load. However, both the futures and cas= h markets jumped. Futures closed up $0.374 the day the report was announced= , and the cash market rose $0.20 - $0.40 the day after. Some chose to not b= elieve the 3 Bcf storage fill reported by the AGA, chalking it up to bad da= ta. The average amount injected during a week in August is over 60 Bcf. The=  prior week's fill was 80 Bcf. Factoring in Barry and the prolonged heat wa= ve that week, the market had been expecting a somewhat lower number, but al= l had predicted something above 50 Bcf. There are various reports and theor= ies. Buyers for northeastern utilities said they had all injected and were = shocked by the minus 12 Bcf storage number reported for the East. They coul= d not entirely dismiss it, however. They noted that in the last 4 years all=  the new plants that have been built are natural gas only facilities. Last = week could have been a good indication of what that could mean to the marke= t. The AGA says they checked and re-checked when they came up with the unbe= lievable number. The AGA's numbers have always lined up with the more exten= sive EIA reports. It is possible that a number of factors came together all=  at once, with the impact of Barry on production and an higher generation l= oads because of Eastern heat wave. However, the curve in the cash market ha= s been going down. That may mean that if there is a market opportunity to m= ove volumes from storage to a consumer right now, that could be done, assum= ing 4 or 5 weeks later it could be replaced at the same price or maybe even=  less. Also, there is speculation that the pipelines were re-packing their = lines with volumes out of storage because of a sudden draw down. =20 Ziff Energy Group to Hold Conference In Portland =20 Current Realities, Future Expectations Pacific NorthwestGas Strategies Conference October 2,2001Portland,Oregon(at the Hilton Portland) Hear Commissioner Wilson Condon, State of Alaska, describe how Alaskagas su= pply will energize the Pacific Northwestsupply portfolio.

McKinsey analysis shows that the traditional triumvirate of earnings growth, inflation, and interest rates continues to drive stock prices. http://www.mckinseyquarterly.com/ab_g.asp?ar=1104&nlink=21  Broadband media: Look before you leap How long will it be before broadband for consumers revolutionizes television and video entertainment? After all, some 40 million households in the United States will gain access to broadband during the next three to five years. But broadcasters and other programmers would do well to temper their enthusiasm, at least for now: the time isn't right to invest heavily in broadband programming. http://www.mckinseyquarterly.com/ab_g.asp?ar=1100&nlink=22  Brains abroad Where does global talent go when opportunities aren't sufficiently plentiful at home? To the United States, of course. In the 1990s alone, some 650,000 people from emerging markets migrated there on professional-employment visas. This talent drain could have lasting economic repercussions for the developing world, depriving it not only of the skills of these workers but also of their beneficial effects on the productivity of others. http://www.mckinseyquarterly.com/ab_g.asp?ar=1101&nlink=23  Better UK productivity: An inside job There is little debate that Britain's manufacturing sector is in decline but less consensus about the reasons for it. A recent McKinsey study makes clear that the problem isn't the quality of the country's workforce: foreign-owned companies in Britain, drawing from the same pool of frontline labor as their British-owned competitors, are achieving much higher levels of productivity. The fault instead lies with British manufacturing companies that have failed to adopt practices proved elsewhere. http://www.mckinseyquarterly.com/ab_g.asp?ar=1106&nlink=24  +++++++++++++++++Also on the site this month++++++++++++  Shall we dance? http://www.mckinseyquarterly.com/ab_g.asp?ar=1105&nlink=25  The promised economy http://www.mckinseyquarterly.com/ab_g.asp?ar=1108&nlink=26  Mobilizing South Korea's women http://www.mckinseyquarterly.com/ab_g.asp?ar=1107&nlink=27  Chicago thinks small http://www.mckinseyquarterly.com/ab_g.asp?ar=1109&nlink=28  ------------------------------------------------------------- You are receiving this monthly newsletter because you are a registered user at mckinseyquarterly.com, the on-line business and economics journal published by McKinsey & Company.

I believe that there is some confusion regarding which part of that Raptor transaction we are talking about.  There are actually two different sets of forwards: one for up to 18MM shares contingently based on price as an offset to the Whitewing forward shortfall, and the other was for 12MM shares which was more of a straight restricted forward contract on ENE shares.  We all went over the valuations on both sets of forwards pretty thoroughly back in March, and I'm certain that the valuations that were put together included the contingent nature of the forwards on the 18MM shares.  In fact, I believe that we had a meeting with a couple of managers from Arthur Andersen to discuss the general methodology.  Of course, the valuations on the 12MM shares had no such component.  Let me know if you have more questions or concerns.  Thanks Vince.

We were not aware of this conditionality at the time the project.  We can, however, easily, incorporate it in our valuation model. This omission makes our valuation more conservative form the Enron's point of view.   Please, let us know if this is required.

All EBS commercial support functions will be integrated into thos= e units within EWS, which enables us to better manage the resources and cos= ts of the support functions.  All EBS commercial functions have been consolidated into the following unit= s: Europe - headed by Matthew Scrimshaw Asia - headed by Anthony Duenner Americas - headed by Rich DiMichele  Additionally, the North American EBS origination teams have been consolidat= ed into one group, led by Stewart Seeligson.  North American trading and ri= sk management will continue to report to Paul Racicot.  Paul will also over= see the global portfolio from a risk management perspective.  Global Network Operations will continue to report to the EBS Office of the = Chairman.  All EBS asset positions will continue to be reviewed and repositioned to mo= st effectively meet the future needs of EBS and the Portland office will be=  closed by October 1.   Global Strategic Sourcing Effective July 1, a number of measures and recommendations have been implem= ented to reduce expenditures associated with, among other things, travel an= d entertainment, and professional services.  Global Strategic Sourcing (""GS= S"") will undertake this very important initiative and they would like to en= list your support in the implementation of these new procedures.  This message will focus on Travel and entertainment.  Next week's message w= ill focus on professional services.  Travel and Entertainment - Enron has a tremendous opportunity to save on tr= avel and entertainment expenditures by making some relatively painless adju= stments.  ?=09Air Travel - Air transportation is the single largest component in the = travel mix.  In recognition of this fact, a number of significant discounts=  have been negotiated with all of the major carriers.  There are two separa= te channels available to employees to access the Enron-negotiated fares.  T= he first is Travel Agency in the Park (""TAP""), or the GSS-approved preferre= d travel agency for your location, and the second is the new Enron-managed = online travel booking service, ClickTrip, located at <http://clicktrip.enro= n.com/enron>.  Over the coming weeks, GSS will be promoting training and usage of ClickTri= p, as the primary method of booking domestic U.S. travel for a number of re= asons.  First, excluding proprietary carriers like Southwest Airlines, Clic= kTrip provides employees easy access to all travel and pricing options for = their destination, including the Enron-negotiated fares.  Second, industry = data shows that employees will generally make the most cost-effective trave= l decision when presented with the relevant facts.  Conservatively speaking= , we estimate that a 20% savings in airfare is attainable through the use o= f this tool alone.  Third, it is relatively painless to use.  Fourth, Click= Trip is accessible 24X7 from any internet-enabled personal computer and aft= er-hours telephone support is available. If you have travel-related questio= ns, please contact Tracy Ramsey at ext. 6-8311. =20 One final air travel reminder worth promoting: For employees who fly in the=  United States, use of non-refundable coach tickets generally runs 65 perce= nt less than refundable tickets and can usually be changed by simply paying=  a $100 fee.  ?=09Lodging and Car Rental - GSS has also negotiated preferred rates at a n= umber of hotel chains in many cities worldwide to accommodate your business=  unit's individual hotel policy. Additionally, preferred car rental rates i= ncluding insurance coverage with National (U.S. and Canada) and Alamo (U.S.= ) have been negotiated for your use.  More detailed information is availabl= e regarding both programs through our travel site located at <http://travel= .enron.com>.  Enron Industrial Markets - Forest Products EIM began trading in the physical markets for Forest Products (newsprint, p= ulp, recycled paper, and lumber) in August, 2000 and Steel in January, 2001= .  Since then EIM has handled over 140,000 tons of recycled paper, 180,000 = tons of newsprint, 150,000 tons of pulp, 160 million board feet of lumber, = and 210,000 tons of steel.  Currently on a weekly basis, EIM is moving appr= oximately 20,000 tons of forest products (newsprint, pulp and recycled pape= r), 3 million board feet of lumber, and 10,000 tons of steel products throu= ghout the world. =20  Due to much larger volumes of forward trading, EIM is expanding its physica= l product delivery capabilities around the world to physically handle 5 mil= lion tons per year.  The EIM Logistics Group coordinates the activities of = customer service, supply and demand matching, scheduling of owned assets, a= nd physical transport and warehousing.  These activities are primarily coor= dinated through the Houston office, with additional resources in London and=  Singapore.  Additionally, EIM owns paper mills in Quebec City and New Jersey which have=  a combined production capacity of 750,000 tons of newsprint per month, and=  a cold rolling steel mill in Arkansas with capacity of 400,000 tons per ye= ar.  Each of these facilities includes Logistics resources that are coordin= ated through the EIM Logistics Group.  Enron Global Markets - LNG Enron Global LNG has enhanced its Atlantic Basin LNG supply portfolio with = volumes from Nigeria LNG Limited (NLNG).  Enron Global LNG recently signed = a Memorandum of Understanding with NLNG for delivery of 1 BCM/ year (billio= n cubic meters) or (97,000 Mcf/day) from the NLNG Plus Project.  This is a = two train expansion of NLNG's existing Bonny Island LNG production facility= .  The expansion is scheduled for completion in 2005.  This deal represents=  a major step in the establishment of Enron's global LNG network.  EGM - Finance & Structuring On June 29, 2001, Enron Global Markets - LNG Group successfully completed t= he divestiture of its 100% equity interest in Progasco, to CHDR, Inc. via a= n all cash transaction.  Progasco sells and distributes LPG to commercial a= nd industrial clients, and independent resellers, through a fleet of tanker=  trucks, bobtail trucks and 13 filling plants throughout Puerto Rico.  CHDR= , Inc. is the record and beneficial owner of all of the issued and outstand= ing shares of stock of Tropigas de Puerto Rico, Inc. (""Tropigas"").  Upon co= mpletion of this transaction, Tropigas, hitherto the 3rd largest market pla= yer will operate the newly consolidated entity and control a 35% market sha= re, becoming the 2nd largest Puerto Rican LPG marketer.=20  The sale proceeds of approximately $14.3 million, have been split between P= rotane (a wholly owned Enron Corp. Delaware subsidiary) and San Juan Gas (S= JG), and were used to pay down inter-company debt owed to SJG and Pro Carib= e.  The net (pre-tax) gain recorded on the transaction was $3.9 million.=20  The profitable sale of this strategic asset allows EGM to exit the retail p= ropane business it inherited through the 1985 merger of three companies: Pr= otane, Petrolane and Imperial Gas, and will enable Enron to better deploy t= he cash received and more efficiently manage its Puerto Rican human resourc= es.=20  EGM - Weather The Weather group just completed a deal with People's Energy to protect the= m against lower gas prices during a warmer than normal winter.  This innova= tive winter protection was structured to manage People's exposure to both t= he volume and price of natural gas.  Greg Penman and Bob Beyer, from the Ch= icago office, were the lead dealmakers for this transaction.  Simlar deals = with other counterparties are expected to come over the winter season. Also, the Weather Group has started exploring new opportunities with EES.  = To support this effort, Elsa Piekieniak has joined the group.  Elsa is look= ing for several people to help her with this initiative.  If you're interes= ted in a position, please contact Elsa.

Overall the business has seen continued strong growth with=  revenues increasing to over $100 million in the first half of the year up = from $30 million for the same period last year.  Earnings per share this qu= arter also exceeded analyst expectations and came in at $0.45 for the quart= er up from $0.34 for the same period last year.  Equally important, however, is the vital role Enron Europe played this quar= ter in contributing to the company's overall results.   We are seeing some = terrific trends here in Europe - notably, on the wholesale side, the Contin= ental, UK and Nordic power and gas teams keep going from strength to streng= th as we see exceptional growth in volumes and transactions continue this q= uarter.  Total physical and financial settled volumes for gas and power in = Europe have seen an increase of 172% in the first six months of the year co= mpared to the first six months in 2000 and the total number of transactions=  per day has risen to 604 from 272 last year.  Specifically, UK power volum= es are up 204% to 147 TWh in the first six months of 2001 from 48 TWh in th= e same period last year.  Continental gas volumes have grown from 351 Bbtue= /day in 2000 to 1,390 Bbtue/day in 2001 - a 296% increase - and Continental=  power volumes have seen growth of 360% with volumes rising from 18 TWh in = the first six months of 2000 to 83 TWh for the same period this year.  The = growth in volumes is not simply limited to the UK and Continental markets, = however, as Nordic power volumes have increased by 153% from 29 TWh to 73 T= Wh in the first half of 2001.  The success stories are not just limited to gas and power trading, however,=  and abound throughout the business:  Enron Energy Services The retail business has experienced a real boost this quarter with the clos= ing of EES' first, major ""marquis"" brand energy outsourcing transaction wit= h supermarket giant, J.

The customer, based in=  Stendal, Germany, operates steam boilers for a milk factory and will be ta= king gas from Enron for a contract of 9.3 MW of interruptible one-year base=  load.  In connection with this supply contract the Continental Gas Trading team co= mpleted a gas supply transaction, the first inside Germany by a non-incumbe= nt player, with EnBW at Steinitz, to overcome capacity constraints expected=  in Q3 this year.  Due to the fragmented gas industry in Germany, Enron had=  to secure transport with no less than four network operators inside German= y in order to close the gas supply deal.  ""Although we are happy that we ha= ve successfully secured all necessary transportation to fulfill our contrac= tual obligations, it was quite a challenge to reach agreement with four net= work operators -- while this was a transaction only within Germany, the neg= otiation with the network operators was as complex as securing gas transpor= t from Ireland through the UK and Belgium into France,"" commented Carsten H= aack, who closed this deal together with Helge-Juergen Beil, Ulrich Finke a= nd Gordon Smith from the German Gas Origination team.  Another important el= ement of the deal is that the team succeeded in establishing the first tran= sportation contract for VNG, Germany's largest German import company after = Ruhrgas. ""This contract will serve as a useful basis for future gas deals, = especially in East Germany, "" said Haack. ""But more importantly, this deal = will send a message to the market that once again Enron has proven to custo= mers it can deliver on its promises and, of equal importance, that network = operators had better take our transportation requests seriously!"" he added.

CHICAGO -(Dow Jones)-The City of Chicago and 47 suburban communities have decided to divide new deals for 400 megawatts of power between Enron Corp. (ENE) and local utility Commonwealth Edison Co., Chicago officials said Wednesday.  In the largest power purchase agreement in Illinois since the state choose to deregulate the industry in 1997, the local government groups will get 60% of their power from Enron and 40% from Exelon Corp.'s (EXC) ComEd. The municipalities use the power for public buildings and public transportation. Chicago announced Monday that the group has picked ComEd to meet the renewable target by providing 80 megawatts of power created with landfill gas, wind and other sources. ComEd will also provide the coalition with another 80 megawatts of power generated with fossil fuel and nuclear plants, and Enron will provide the other 240 megawatts. The new contracts are expected to go into effect this year.

I have been promising this to folks for awhile now, so your request spurred me to action.  I will send later a copy of Lydia, our workbook program for distributing hourly prices from scalars, consistent with on- and off-peak monthly prices, and recognizing about 70+ reasonability constraints.  It is actually an exhaustive search optimization program.  The disversity in hourly prices is optimized.  I understand this is not something you are immediately interested in, so there is no particular urgency to get it to you.  (I need to update the documentation a bit.)  Incidently, you need to have Microsoft Equation Editor 3.0 installed in Word to properly read this document.  I believe it is part of the standard Office 97 install, so there shouldn't be any problem.  Nevertheless, if you run into problems viewing the document, take a look at your Word references.  Hope this is useful, Michael  >>> Kiatsupaibul, Seksan 07/23/01 11:48AM >>> Dear Michael:  Houston, we have some problems.  I am a research member, working with Krishna and Osman supporting EES.  Now we have some projects about load curtailment options.  They would like to have volatility for power price on the hourly basis.  Attending the meeting last Thursday, we heard that you have written up about the methodology how to build such an hourly volatility.  Osman let me contact you requesting for the model.  I would appreciate if you can provide me one.  By the way, if this is not the Michael, sorry to bother you.

As you may recall from the prior analysis, they placed a option collar around the collateral (ENE stock).  At that time, they felt that it would support the portfolio to around $20 / share.  The main assumption, however, was that the assets in the Raptor structure would not devalue.  Of course, for the public equities such as AVICI this is simply not the case.  At the time of the initial analysis in March, AVCI traded at roughly $17 / share and it now trades at $3.65 / share on approximately 1.1 million shares.  OOPS!

We can then compare with the JCC offers shown by MS.  We are checking the credit of this company.  It would be good to put a live deal in front of Shankman that wasn't too huge or of too long term.  Concept of minimizing the cost of our education and testing our hedging strategy for JCC.  Let me know if you need additional info.

"John,  A quick comment about seating arrangements for the weather group. I understand the new plan is to put both the gas and power weather guys at one location.  My recommendation is against it. If the objective of having two separate weather groups is to put in place a system of checks and balances and encourage independent views, the new seating arrangements will nullify it. The power weather guys will  defer to Mike who has unquestionable authority and experience.  If we go ahead with the new seating arrangements it makes sense to combine the two groups under Mike's leadership.  Please, let me know what you think.

Thorn, senior vice president, Environmental and International Government Affairs. A colleague of mine heard him speak in Kyoto in 1997 and said he gave a superb talk. As of 2000 he was still in this position, though I could not verify that he is now.  The proposed topic is Global Warming Policy and the Energy Industry. ---How will the Bonn agreement affect global strategy? What will be the near-term and long-term consequences of the agreement? ---How does US non-participation affect US market strategies versus strategies in participating countries? ---What is Enron's current position on global greenhouse gas policy? How is Enron managing and hedging this position? ---How will developing country energy markets participate in greenhouse gas mitigation?  The Energy Club Speaker Series takes place every other Monday from 4:30 to 6:30. There are a number of dates open during Fall semester.  I appreciate very much your help in trying to arrange this. Please let me know if there is any other information you need.

I ran the idea to get a speaker on global warming by the 2nd yr in charge of the Energy Club (http://dolphin.upenn.edu/~energy), and he thought that would be great. And furthermore, the prof who I do research for(Paul Kleindorfer)said he is very well connected with the big guys at Enron and would love to jointly sponsor the talk. SO, do you remember the guy's name? Was it Robert Reilly possibly? I don't know if he would still be there but we can try.

Ding.    -----Original Message----- From:  Yuan, Ding   Sent: Thursday, August 23, 2001 5:54 PM To: Schultz, Cassandra Subject: Meeting with Gordon on Raptor    I have talked with Gordon regarding to the impact of current Enron stock price on the Raptor structure.  Here are the main points:  1) After the March  fix-up, Raptor hedged ENE credit capacity all the way down to ENE $20/share.  And the collars are consists of European type options.  The maturities are:  original collars for Raptor I, II, IV will mature in 2003.  The new collars for Raptor II and IV will mature in 2005.    2) The collars were transacted with ENE.  3) The option settling method will be equity method.  Enron will hand over shares at the maturity.  But there is a maximum 3 share per option limit.   For example:   With a strike of $80,  if ENE price drop down to $20, the intrinsic value of the option is $60 which means ENE will have to hand over $60/$20=3 shares.   But if ENE price drop down to $10, ENE still only hand over 3 shares, with $30 in value.  4) When options exercised, Enron will have share dilution but no impact on Enron income.  5) A good portion of the public equities have been liquidated by Raptor at a substantial discount. (I have the list and the share numbers) The notional value of all the swapped assets at the time of Raptor inception was $733.68 MM.  Current value of assets remain in Raptors are $141.8 MM.  6) While the raptors have hedged Enron's credit capacities,  the current Enron credit capacity dropped from around ($36MM) after the fix up, to around ($237MM) as of 8/20/01.  Hope these information help answering some of the question you had.  Ding.  ",vkaminski@aol.com,j.kaminski@enron.com,FW: Meeting with Gordon on Raptor,2001-08-27 09:27:52-07:00,sent

The total exposure in DPC of these FI= s, and a few banks like the State Bank of India and Canara Bank, including = foreign currency guarantees, works out to over Rs 5,500 crore. Little wonde= r, therefore, that investors fear more red ink splashed over the balance sh= eets of the FIs and are hurrying to move out of their investments in these = FIs.=20  The stock prices of all the three FIs have been sliding. While the stock pr= ice of IDBI and IFCI have touched new lows of Rs 16 and Rs 2.90, respective= ly, that of ICICI is still holding at around Rs 50-55 levels. Early this mo= nth, IDBI was quoted at Rs 19.90, IFCI at Rs 3.60 and ICICI at Rs 59.30. IC= ICI, however, had touched Rs 51 on August 9, a new low from previous levels= . This clearly indicates that, plagued by the rising share of non-performin= g loans (NPLs) to total assets of all the three FIs, the share prices of th= ese FIs have came under severe pressure.=20  Analysts tracking the banking and FI counters say that the sliding trend is=  feared to be continued over the days and weeks ahead, especially because o= f the tightening of the non-performing assets guidelines by the Reserve Ban= k of India (RBI). Moreover, the kind of trading activity witnessed at these=  counters is alarming. While the volume of share trade is substantial, ther= e is a sharp fall in the stock prices of these stocks. Quite clearly, these=  are no good indicators, at least for the time being. However, these compan= ies disbursal/approvals to DPC are well within the stipulated RBI norms, i.= e., 15 per cent of total disbursal/ approvals.=20  For example, ICICI's gross NPL as of March 2001, stands at a whopping Rs 5,= 988 crore. Power sector leads the approval and disbural list of ICICI at Rs=  6,424 crore and Rs 2,400 crore, respectively. Its exposure in the power se= ctor, which stood at Rs 8,531 crore or 11 per cent of the total exposure of=  Rs 77,279 crore, has been on the decline. Last year they stood at 11.6 per=  cent of Rs 65,495 crore. On the other hand, IDBI's stock price is on the s= lide since the beginning of this month. It is currently quoting at Rs 16. T= he counter is experiencing heavy volumes with daily volumes being in the ra= nge of 35,000 plus. The situation is worse for IFCI which is quoting below = par for quite sometime now. Further, the scrip has been losing steam since = August 2, when it was quoting at Rs 4. Currently, it is quoting below Rs 3.= =20 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------= ---------------------------------------------------------------------------= ---------------------------------------------------------------------------= ------------ THE ECONOMIC TIMES, Tuesday, August 28, 2001 FIs initiate search for buyers for Enron stake, Samik Dasgupta & Soma Baner= jee=20  THE SEARCH for getting a buyer for Enron's equity in the Dabhol power proje= ct has started with financial institutions initiating discussions with pote= ntial buyers. FIs have been entrusted with the responsibility of preparing = a roadmap for Enron's exit and finding a solution to pending MSEB payments.=  The first job for FIs is to determine the actual cost required to complete=  the Dabhol project. Although, about 96 per cent of the project is complete= , the stoppage of work for the past few weeks has led to cancellation of co= ntracts and possibilities of the cost escalating. With Enron having already=  announced its unwillingness to pump in additional resources, the new inves= tor will not only have to pay for the equity but also fund the project's co= mpletion. Speaking to ET, finance secretary Ajit Kumar said: ""FIs have been=  told to work out details about the prices that each of the interested buye= r can offer for the Dabhol project. Since it is totally buyer driven, FIs w= ill have to take this into account while holding their discussions with the=  potential buyers. Enron may demand any price but there have to be takers f= or that too.'' Tata Power, Hindujas and some other leading industrial house= s are interested in buying out Enron. FIs are going to talk individually to=  all the interested companies, and the equity will be sold to the highest b= idder, Kumar said.=20  According to FI sources involved with the Dabhol negotiations several angle= s are being looked into as the matter is now complicated with Enron invokin= g legal provisions. ""The aim is to work out an out- of-court settlement to = the issue. Valuation is not an issue as the project has a 25-year life cycl= e,'' an official said. FI sources claimed that their role is that of a faci= litator where they will try and bring the buyer and seller at a common poin= t.FIs are also discussing with the Centre if it is possible for them to get=  a cover for the second phase of the project. As of now, the first phase of=  the project has been given the counter-guarantee while the promoters are p= ushing for a similar cover to ensure payments.=20 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------= ---------------------------------------------------------------------------= ---------------------------------------------------------------------------= ------------ THE ECONOMIC TIMES, Tuesday, August 28, 2001 Dabhol dispute unfortunate: Govt  THE GOVERNMENT on Monday described the dispute over the Enron-promoted Dabh= ol Power Project as an `unfortunate' experience in foreign investment in th= e country's infrastructure sector. ``Enron is a very unfortunate episode in=  our experience with regard to inviting foreign investment in the crucial i= nfrastructure sector and I wish it had never happened,'' minister of state = for external affairs, Omar Abdullah said here. Nevertheless, the country's = judiciary has decided a large number of cases in Enron's favour thereby pro= ving its fair and independent nature, he added. Speaking after launching th= e Confederation of Indian Industries International, the international arm o= f the chamber, he said Indian industry has had enough protection and should=  not ask for more. ``Unless we start looking outwardly and start tapping ne= w markets abroad, our economy may not be able to achieve and grow to its po= tential,'' Abdullah said.Indian missions abroad have to realise that their = role is changing, he said it is now clear that economic diplomacy is integr= al to foreign policy and a key determinant of a country's political and str= ategic influence. He said the ministry of external affairs had also started=  working on these lines and would make every possible effort to provide nec= essary support to the country's business chambers and industry to position = itself as a global player in the emerging global scenario.=20 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------= ---------------------------------------------------------------------------= ---------------------------------------------------------------------------= ------------ THE FINANCIAL EXPRESS, Tuesday, August 28, 2001 Omar terms Dabhol 'unfortunate experience'  THE Centre has called the Enron-promoted Dabhol power project controversy a= s an 'unfortunate' experience. ""Enron is a very unfortunate episode in our = experience with regard to inviting foreign investment in the crucial infras= tructure sector and I wish it had never happened,"" minister of state for ex= ternal affairs Omar Abdullah said here on Monday. Nevertheless, the country= 's judiciary has decided a large number of cases in Enron's favour, thereby= , proving its fair and independent nature, he said, while launching Confede= ration of Indian Industry's (CII) international arm, 'CII International (CI= II)'. Stating that there is no alternative to globalisation, Mr Abdullah sa= id, ""Indian industry has had enough protection and should not ask for more.= "" ""Unless we start looking outwardly and start tapping new markets abroad, = our economy may not be able to achieve and grow to its potential,"" he added= . The new outfit, CIII, created to facilitate the process of internationali= sation of domestic companies, will have a budget of Rs 50 crore, which is a= lmost 50 per cent of the Confederation's total budget, CII president Sanjiv=  Goenka said.=20  Institutionalisation of CIII is part of the value addition exercise of the = Confederation to accelerate the process of globalisation, he said, adding t= hat CII will leverage its 191 partners in 92 countries to the process. CIII=  will be headed by Arun Bharat Ram. Piyush Bahal has been appointed head of=  the CIII secretariat. Speaking on the occasion, Arun Bharat Ram said, ""CII= I will take proactive initiatives to enhance the country's share in interna= tional trade."" He said that CII already has a dedicated WTO cell to facilit= ate the process of internationalisation of domestic companies. Write to the=  Editor=20 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------= ---------------------------------------------------------------------------= ---------------------------------------------------------------------------= ------------ THE TIMES OF INDIA, Tuesday, August 28, 2001 Power Play (Editorial)  With emotions running high over the Dabhol issue, Enron chairman Kenneth La= y understandably showed great alacrity in denying reports that he has threa= tened India with sanctions. In a letter to prime minister A B Vajpayee, Mr = Lay clarified that Enron has not asked the US government to take any such a= ction, and ""is far from suggesting that we have decided to pursue these mec= hanisms"". Fair enough. But are the remarks as innocuous as Enron is making = them out to be? Consider the facts. In the course of the controversial inte= rview, Mr Lay said that if Enron was ""squeezed'' to accept less than the co= st incurred by it on building the power plant, that would amount to ""exprop= riation"" by the Indian government. He added, for good measure, that US laws=  prevent Washington from assisting countries which expropriate the property=  of American companies. Significantly, an Enron team is slated to negotiate=  with Indian lenders this week. One of the proposals doing the rounds is th= at the financial institutions (FIs) buy out Enron's stake in Dabhol Power C= ompany (DPC) and `warehouse' the shares till they can find another buyer. T= he FIs, on their part, have indicated their willingness to slash interest r= ates on the loans to DPC in a bid to make the project viable. But they're n= ot willing to be the only ones to make a sacrifice. So, they're expected to=  ask Enron to accept a discount of 25 to 35 per cent on its asking price. T= he bargaining is likely to be tough, and savvy negotiators routinely try to=  `psyche' the opposition beforehand. Mr Lay is known to be close to the Bus= h administration. In the light of all this, is the timing of his remarks pu= re coincidence?=20  Mr Lay, of course, has his own compulsions. While the Dabhol imbroglio has = undoubtedly hurt India, Enron's armour is not without some chinks  which In= dian negotiators would do well to note. The company faces accusations, whic= h it denies, that it manipulated power prices in California. Its share pric= e has fallen more than 55 per cent since the start of the year, and chief e= xecutive officer Jeffrey Skilling recently quit abruptly, forcing Mr Lay to=  take over the CEO's job as well. Unfortunately, Indian negotiators are unl= ikely to use what should be their trump card  the Godbole Committee's obser= vation that the Dabhol deal was a failure of governance at every step of th= e decision-making process. Because doing so could embarrass too many promin= ent people on both ends of the political spectrum. Even so, the Indian side=  should hang tough. There have been suggestions that the LNG plant be spun = off as a separate power centre, Enron let out its harbour facilities to oth= er LNG importers, and the foreign currency loans be converted into rupee lo= ans. These could form the basis of a fair deal that would allow both India = and Enron to move on from the mess they have landed in. Hopefully, the Dabh= ol debacle will also send out warning signals to both Indian politicians an= d multinationals about the perils of non-transparent, negotiated deals, as = opposed to a genuinely free market. If it does, and if India gets its act t= ogether on power sector reforms, we may yet see some light at the end of th= e long, long tunnel. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------= ---------------------------------------------------------------------------= ---------------------------------------------------------------------------= ------------ THE TIMES OF INDIA, Tuesday, August 28, 2001 Enron denies seeking sanctions over Dabhol, Sanjay Dutta=20  US energy trading major Enron Corp has denied approaching Washington seekin= g sanctions against India over the dispute with the Maharashtra government = over the $2.9 billion Dabhol power project, even as domestic financial inst= itutions hinted at increasing their exposure in the project by about $483 m= illion (Rs 2,270 crore) for its completion. In a letter to Prime Minister A= tal Bihari Vajpayee on Saturday, a copy of which was available with The Tim= es of India, Enron CEO Kenneth said: ""A recent story in the Financial Times= , which mischaracterised discussions with me, appears to have caused signif= icant, unintended concern. Counter to the impression given in the story, I = have not asked anyone in the US government to consider imposing sanctions.""= =20  Lay said in his letter that Enron's approach was to settle the issue amicab= ly by selling its stake. ""Furthermore, I did not say that the Dabhol power = plant had been expropriated. Upon questioning from the publicator (publishe= r) I did factually explained the several possible options available, includ= ing how one might get to expropriation and about the US laws in place to pr= otect its businesses. However, that is far from suggesting that we have dec= ided to pursue these mechanisms,"" Lay said. ""Our preferred approach approac= h continues to be to resolve this issue amicably by selling our stake to In= dian governmental and financial institutions,"" Lay said.=20  However, Lay tempered his conciliatory stand by adding, ""Without agreement = on that, we have little choice but to follow the termination procedures joi= ntly agreed under the power purchase agreement."" Lay also sent copies of th= e letter to finance minister Yashwant Sinha and power minister Suresh Prabh= u. PTI ADDS: The IDBI-led FIs' consortium may increase their exposure to en= able the project to be completed and negotiate Daphol Power Company's equit= y at a 25 per cent discount to its face value. The FIs are exploring a poss= ibility of taking out offshore equity by investment institutions and utilit= ies after 12-18 months from Phase-II completion, the report said.   If this proposal was accepted by the joint committee of the FIs, then IDBI= 's revised exposure would be at Rs 2,742 crore from existing Rs 2,121 crore= , ICICI Rs 1,904 crore from Rs 1,473 crore, SBI Rs 2,261 crore from Rs 1,74= 9 crore, IFCI Rs 587 crore from Rs 454 crore and Canara Bank Rs 526 crore f= rom Rs 407 crore. ""Even in the best case, the exposure requirements from do= mestic institutions exceed the prudential exposure norms,"" the report quote= d FI sources as saying. Subsequent participation by all other FIs and banks=  like IDFC, PFC, PNB, Union Bank, Bank of India among others would be accru= ed through syndication. FIs may also seek a guarantee from the Centre as a = backup for their exposure, the report quoted the sources as saying. Last we= ek, the FIs had made a presentation to the finance ministry on a possible b= ailout package for Dabhol. The proposals envisage concessions from stakehol= ders, around 22.38 per cent concessional duty on the energy major's liquefi= ed natural gas plant, a mega power project status and offset of custom duti= es on LNG supply.=20 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------= ---------------------------------------------------------------------------= ---------------------------------------------------------------------------= ------------ THE TIMES OF INDIA, Tuesday, August 28, 2001 'Enron has not discussed Dabhol with Bush', Vidyadhar Date=20  Enron has denied that it had approached the U.S. government in an effort to=  obtain sanctions against India in its dispute over the Dabhol power projec= t. The denial came in the wake of a report in the Financial Times of Thursd= ay which carried an interview with Enron chairperson Kenneth Lay. The repor= t quoted Mr Lay as saying there are U.S. laws that could prevent the U.S. g= overnment from providing any aid or assistance to India if it expropriated = properties of U.S. companies. An Enron spokesperson said Mr Lay had not dis= cussed the Dabhol dispute with President George Bush.=20  Meanwhile, the legal tussle between energy activists, the Maharashtra gover= nment and Enron continues in India. The state government is preparing a fre= sh affidavit with strong arguments against Enron in the case filed in the s= upreme court by the Centre for Indian Trade Unions (CITU), which is the lab= our wing of the Communist Party of India (Marxist), and activist Abhay Meht= a against the Dabhol project. The affidavit will make a strong case against=  Enron unlike the previous statement filed by the earlier Shiv Sena-BJP dom= inated state administration which was seen to be favourable to the controve= rsial multinational.=20  The case has been pending in the supreme court for the past four years and = since then major changes have taken place on the Enron front with more and = more evidence emerging against the project. The government will rely substa= ntially on the M.D. Godbole committee report which found a number of infirm= ities in the project and expressed serious concern over the irregularities.=  In the petition, CITU and Abhay Mehta, author of the book Power Play, whic= h gives a detailed account of the the Enron drama, have challenged the clea= rance given to the project by the Central Electricity Authority. They argue= d that since the project had been renegotiated, it required a fresh review = by the CEA. They described as false the claim of the previous government th= at by holding renegotiations it had secured a good deal with lower tariff.= =20  Anti-Enron activists feel that their stand has been vindicated by the recen= t setbacks received by the company. Regarding the explosion in Enron's Tees= ide plant in England which left three workers dead, Mr Pradyumna Kaul, ener= gy activist, said Enron should have prepared a disaster management plan for=  the Dabhol plant.Enron suffered a serious setback last week with the resig= nation of chief executive Jeffrey Skilling, the drastic fall in stocks and = the explosion in the Teeside plant. Mr Kenneth Lay, the company's chairpers= on, is now trying to limit the damage by travelling in the U.S., explaining=  the events to company divisions and trying to improve sentiment on Wall St= reet. While Enron wants to exit from its operations in India, it is also re= ported to be trying to wind up the wind turbine manufacturing business Acti= vists are also encouraged by protests against privatisation of electricity = being voiced in other parts of the world.

Check the intraday  out that suggested a rally would unfold following theFriday August 10th low.     Sure enough, natural gas rallied over 20% the  following week. This may be no more than a short covering rally, as double  bottoms are always to be viewed with suspiciously. Thus far, in the month of  August, natural gas has taken out both the July lows and the July highs forming  an outside bar on the month. Will need to monitor the 2nd qtr close of 2001  closely to gauge whether the July and August double bottom is going to hold or  not. At the very least, the double bottom makes a  fantastic momentum low,  if not the actual intermediate bear market price low.                                             Setting up for an August 27th Three Year Anniversary Low     Lo and behold, Friday August 10 did indeed turn out  to be no more than a Momentum Bear Market Low.  As usual, double bottoms  and tops always make good candidates for failure. But boy what a short covering  rally that was, good for 20% plus in couple of days. In any event, the update to  the monthly chart shows support in the 240-280 zone. Ideally, the bottom will be  seen at or above the November 1990 high at 2.65.  The 85 minute intraday  chart shows an expanding formation setting up a 4 point buy. Noteworthy is the  1.41 ratio at 263.5 that ties in so well with the old 1990 high at 2.65. Of  course downside momentum is strong enough to hammer into the 250's but it would  surprise to see such strong follow through to the downside momentum during the  week of August 27th.     One reason to anticipate downside momentum will  subside next week is a time cycle. Intriguingly, the 3rd step down from the Dec  2000 high will equal the 1st step down in time on Monday August 27th.

VK,    VK vkaminski@aol.com  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------    Les buveurs de vin plus intelligents que les amateurs de bi?re Lundi 27 ao?t 2001 (LEMONDE.FR)   Le match entre tenants de la chope de bi?re et amoureux du verre de vin a-t-il trouv? son ?pilogue ? Apr?s les ?tudes attestant des effets b?n?fiques du ballon de rouge dans la pr?vention du cancer de l'intestin et celle, publi?e la semaine derni?re en Tch?coslovaquie, vantant les vertus des blondes contre les maladies cardiaques, le suspense ?tait ? son comble. L'?tude sur les m?rites compar?s des buveurs de chacune des boissons, publi?e le 14 ao?t au Danemark, est donc arriv?e ? point nomm?.   ""Nous sommes les premiers au monde qui avons pu d?montrer clairement que les buveurs de vin sont plus intelligents et fonctionnent beaucoup mieux ? tous les ?gards que les amateurs de bi?re"", s'est f?licit? Erik Lykke Mortensen, chercheur en psychologie au centre danois des sciences ?pid?miologiques, dans les colonnes du B.T. le 14 ao?t. Le quotidien ? grand tirage, relay? par la tr?s s?rieuse revue Archives of International Medecine, d?taille la gen?se de l'?tude : diligent?e par l'universit? de Copenhague en collaboration avec le Kinsey Institute, aux Etats-Unis, elle partait de l'hypoth?se - ?mise par plusieurs ?tudes danoises r?centes - que les buveurs mod?r?s de vin sont en meilleure sant? que les personnes consommatrices d'autres boissons alcoolis?es.   Les chercheurs se sont pench?s sur 363 hommes et 303 femmes ?g?s de 29 ? 34 ans. Ils ont pass? au crible le statut socio-?conomique, le niveau d'?ducation, le quotient intellectuel, les sympt?mes psychiatriques, la personnalit? et le comportement en mati?re de sant?, notamment la consommation d'alcool, de chacun des cobayes. Lesquels ont ?t? divis?s en deux cat?gories, selon qu'ils buvaient de la bi?re ou du vin.   Il a ?t? observ? que boire du vin est associ? ? des QI, une ?ducation et un statut socio-?conomique ?lev?s. A l'inverse, les consommateurs de bi?re obtiennent des r?sultats bien moins probants. Qui plus est, le buveur de vin semble psychologiquement plus ?quilibr? que l'amateur de mousse.   Alors, est-ce le vin qui rend intelligent ou le fait d'?tre intelligent qui incite ? boire du vin ? Les scientifiques ont choisi le second terme de l'alternative. Ainsi, les effets apparemment b?n?fiques du vin r?sulteraient surtout d'une bonne ?ducation, notamment sur les questions de sant?, et de la mod?ration de ses consommateurs. Ces conclusions viennent conforter les Danois dans leur nouvelles habitudes. Traditionnellement grands adeptes de la bi?re, ils sont de plus en plus nombreux ? s'adonner au vin. Les ?tudes utiles font les peuples intelligents.   Claire An?  --------------------------------------------------------------------------- *Droits de reproduction et de diffusion r?serv?s; ?

There is a lot of excitement here currently about the energy industry, and we have a very active Energy group that arranges engagements and discussions.   The proposed topic is Global Warming Policy and the Energy Industry, though we are open to any suggestions of the speaker. Questions include:    ---How will the Bonn agreement affect global strategy? What will be the near-term and long-term consequences of the agreement?    ---How does US non-participation affect US market strategies versus strategies in participating countries?    ---What is Enron's current position on global greenhouse gas policy? How is Enron managing and hedging this position?    ---How will developing country energy markets participate in greenhouse gas mitigation?     The Energy Club Speaker Series takes place every other Monday at 4:30 PM. Dates open are September 24, Oct 1, Nov 5, Nov 12. A presentation is followed by Q&A and then a suggested dinner and cocktails with Prof. Paul Kleindorfer and a few students.  Thank you again for your help. I look forward to hearing back from you or someone in your group.

Here are some comments:  1. The document falls short of describing how to use the method in practice, but rather gives some general motivation. I am confident that I myself could not develop an algorithm based on this document, unless all of the derivative valuation functions are explicit (and rather nice) functions with explicit derivatives of the underlying variables, in which case the VAR problem is not so hard in any case, as Monte Carlo is very effective in this case. (My comment here is critical of exposition. I do not suggest that the proposed method is weak!)  2. The remark (p. 2) that my paper with Jun Pan addresses only normal returns is not correct. The main point of our paper was to allow for jumps, including fat tails and skewness. The comment that we rely on delta-gamma is a good criticism,and the main potential advantage of the reliability approach, if it works in practical cases.  3. There is a typo at page 2, at 9 lines from the bottom, where I presume g(T(u)), not g(T(x))  4. There is a missing `we' on page 5, 9 lines from the bottom.  5. The remark on CPU time (page 7) does not mention what machine was used.  6. The example (page 8) does not really have much non-normality. Skewness=0, and kurtosis (4) (is this excess kurtosis?) are not much compared to most practical cases, in which kurtosis is an extra order of magnitude, with lots of skewness.   Overall, the paper piqued my curiosity a lot, and left me wanting more clarity, and a cookbook.   I hope `events' at Enron have not made things difficult for you.  I will later bill you for one hour, if that is OK.

Sent: Wednesday, August 29, 2001 11:22 PM To: Kaminski, Vince J; Crenshaw, Shirley Subject: 2002 Plan Variance from 2001 Forecast Importance: High  Vince,  As part of the plan process, I have to prepare a variance analysis between the 2001 forecast and the 2002 plan.  I have attached a summary for your review and I need your help explaining some of the variances.  The 2001 forecast is based mostly on plan, but I did use an annualized amount for some expenses for which the actuals were considerably above or below plan.  Please let me know if you think I need to adjust the forecast because this will, in turn, affect the variances.  The main items I need are as follows:  1) An explanation of the increase in headcount (14 people (26%) over the average of 53 I have forecasted).  2) The Recruiting and Relocations account is new for 2002 - these costs were previously included in Travel.  Therefore, I would expect that the sum of Recruiting and Relocations and Travel for 2002 would be comparable to the 2001 Forecast for Travel alone, but there is a variance of about $140,000 (38%).  I expect that much of this is due to the increase in headcount, but that is not enough to fully justify the increase.  Are you expecting a higher level of travel in 2002?  3) Same as above for Conferences and Training.  This is a new account and these costs used to be in Tuition Reimbursement (this account included all training).  The increase in Tuition Reimbursement alone is really more than I can explain as due to the increase in headcount.  Are there specific conferences planned for 2002 that were not attended in 2001?  4) Can you give me a breakdown of what is included in the amount for Outside Services?  5) If I understand your allocation percentages, you will allocate 100% to other business units, compared to the approximately 73% that is forecast.  Is this correct?  Thanks for your help, Diane X5-7996   ",vkaminski@aol.com,j.kaminski@enron.com,FW: 2002 Plan Variance from 2001 Forecast,2001-08-30 14:59:55-07:00,sent

Or maybe you'll get lucky and Yahoo! will buy you.""  * ""Never has incumbency been worth less. . . . The Internet has turned bricks and mortar into millstones.  And venture capitalists pour millions of dollars into terrorist training camps for industry insurgents.""  * ""Consumers aren't going to spend the rest of their lives wandering the soulless canyons of Wal-Mart to save a couple of bucks on a hammer. . . . And all those ""big box"" retailers afloat in a sea of asphalt will one day find themselves out of the Internet-enabled revolution.

Yet the world's largest construction company is helping Webvan, a start-up build a new distribution infrastructure that will support the home delivery of groceries ordered online.""  * ""Administrators posses an exaggerated confidence in great execution, believing this is all you need to succeed in a discontinuous world.""

After:  Features/E-Corp/The Think Tank; Inside The Revolution Smart Mover, Dumb Mover Think the first-mover advantage is a myth? You're wrong: Most pioneering dot-coms failed not because they were first but because they were dumb. Gary Hamel  09/03/2001 Fortune Magazine Time Inc. Page 191 (Copyright 2001) I'm not fond of business aphorisms. Bigger is better, content is king, own the customer, cannibalize yourself--these are just a few of the cliches that trivialize complex business issues. Another is the idea of first-mover advantage, with its promise of extraordinary rewards for any company that is first to market with a new service or product. At the height of dot-com mania, first-mover advantage was a near-sacred mantra for VCs and entrepreneurs alike. E-commerce zealots argued that early success would compound even more quickly on the Web than in the dawdling old economy. Being first to build a consumer brand in a new category (Amazon), invent a new business model (eBay), or achieve critical mass (what Webvan was hoping to do) were seen as surefire routes to Midas-like profits.  In reality, of course, first-mover advantages proved illusory. For most dot-com startups, being first was simply a way to lose more, faster.  Many pundits began to argue that being a fast follower was a better strategy than trying to be the leader. Old-economy CEOs, eager to avoid the hard work of strategic innovation, seized upon this diagnosis to justify their instinctive fear of novelty. Suddenly, timidity was heralded as a virtue.  But the fast-follower advocates had it wrong as well. Most Internet companies failed not because they were first movers but because they were dumb movers. What companies should learn from the Internet debacle is not that being first is a dangerous form of hubris but that being dumb seldom succeeds. When it comes to trailblazing, there are at least three ways to be a dumb mover--none of which is unique to Internet startups.  Dumb: Getting your timing wrong   If a company invests faster than it learns, it will over-drive the opportunity and end up with an expensive and embarrassing failure.  That's the fate that befell Apple's pioneering handheld computer, the Newton. Was there a potential market out there for palm computers? Sure.  Could investment and marketing hype alone force the market to develop on Apple's time frame? No. Companies that over-drive an emerging opportunity often under-drive it later on. The initial performance gap, a product of unrealistic expectations and over- investment, produces a rapid retrenchment--and an opening for latecomers.  There is a market-penetration curve for every emerging opportunity.  Typically, this curve has an inflection point: a moment when all the pieces of the business model finally fall into place, customer demand explodes, and the market takes off. For videocassette recorders, the curve began to slope gently upward with the launch of Matsushita's VHS format in the late '70s, yet it would take another seven years for VCRs to find their way into one million American homes. By contrast, the market-penetration curve for Hotmail was a near vertical line, with more than ten million users signing up in the first 18 months. Matsushita ran a marathon. Hotmail ran a sprint. The Apple Newton might have evolved into something Palm-like, but only if Apple had paced itself by spending less, learning faster, and iterating more quickly. Apple blew the handheld opportunity not because it was the first mover but because it was a dumb mover.  Any management team that aspires to be a first mover must ask itself, What race are we running: sprint or marathon? If you try to run a 100-yard sprint like a marathon, you'll be left behind. If you try to run a marathon like a 100-yard sprint, you'll keel over from exhaustion.  So it is critically important to ask some questions: Are there difficult technical hurdles? Does market takeoff depend on the development of complementary products or services? Will a new infrastructure be required? Will customers need to learn new skills or adopt new behaviors? Are there high switching costs for customers? Will competing standards confuse customers? Are there powerful competitors that will seek to delay or derail us? If the answer to any of those questions is yes, a company must be careful not to pour in too many resources too soon; the race is going to be a marathon.  On the other hand, answer yes to all of these questions, and you'll need to sprint out of the starting block: Are the customer benefits clear and substantial? Are there potential network effects that will accelerate takeoff? Are there powerful competitors that will be compelled to follow?  Staying on the optimal penetration curve--neither over-driving nor under-driving an opportunity--is a neat trick, but it's not impossible.  AOL, Sun Microsystems, and Quicken-maker Intuit have all done it at one time or another. Smart movers continually review their initial assumptions about the business model, avoid the premium pricing and narrow market definition that create space for latecomers, move quickly to collaborate with would-be competitors, and outsource to maintain flexibility.  Dumber: Overpaying for market share  The allure of capturing a first-mover advantage often produces a spending orgy among a gaggle of look-alike competitors, each intent on ramping up faster than its rivals. That is exactly what happened in many areas of e-commerce. Services were given away free, ad budgets were doubled and then tripled, and massive investments were made in IT infrastructure--all in the quest of getting bigger, faster. In such cases, it's easy to overpay for market share.  To reap a first-mover advantage, a company must buy market share at a discount. That is, it must be able to buy a big chunk of market share before its competitors figure out just how much that share will yield in future profits. That is possible only if a company has a business idea that is truly original, as did eBay and ICQ (the Israeli company that invented instant messaging and was later acquired by AOL).  The fact is, the Internet didn't produce too much in the way of authentic business-model innovation, but rather too little. And even when an original idea did surface, it didn't stay original for long, thanks to the incessant, incestuous networking among Silicon Valley's venture capital companies. The moral is simple: If you want to profit from a first-mover advantage, you'd better make sure you start with a unique strategic insight that, at least initially, is unattractive to would-be competitors or protected by a wall of patents. Dumb movers swarm; smart movers don't.  Dumbest: Being first with a business model that's DOA  Pets.com. Iridium. Webvan. Northpoint.   Many business models are brain-dead from the get-go. They breathe as long as they are hooked up to the ventilator of investor funds but expire the moment investors swallow their grief and pull the plug. There are two fundamental flaws that can render a business model DOA: a complete misreading of the customer (does she really want to order dog food online?) and utterly unsound economics (there will never be enough petroleum geologists and Arctic explorers to make satellite telephony pay). There's no advantage in being first if the destination ain't worth the trip.  Not that this should be seen as an argument for always staying behind. A stupid idea that fails is hardly an indictment of the notion of first-mover advantage. Think twice before you let someone else's idiocy lull you into believing that being first is always a peril-strewn path.  Ask Fred Smith at FedEx if he was glad to be first in overnight package delivery, or Andy Grove at Intel (microprocessors), or Herb Kelleher at Southwest Airlines (discount air travel), or Pete Kight at CheckFree (online billing and payment), or Jeff Skilling at Enron (energy trading).  I don't believe any company should set out to be a follower, fast or otherwise. Sure, in hindsight, first movers often look dumb, but it would be imprudent to bet that they will always screw up. Indeed, when you look beyond the lunacy of the Internet bubble and consider companies with high-quality management, deep pockets, and real competencies, you find that being first pays off a surprisingly often.  So before you bet against the first mover, you'd be wise to ask yourself, Am I sure the first mover is going to be a slow learner? Will market penetration stay in single digits for some time to come, giving me time to grab customers later on? Will the rate of technology change remain high, creating opportunities for a leapfrog strategy? Will the first mover fail in signing up the most valuable partners? If you can answer yes to all these questions, then you may have the chance to be a successful second mover.  In the end, the distinction between first mover and fast follower hides more than it reveals. The goal, after all, is not to be first to market in some absolute sense, but to be first to put together the precise combination of features, value, and sound business economics that unlocks a profitable new market. Sometimes the company that does this is the first mover, and sometimes it is not. But it's always the smart mover.

I encourage each of you to attend, as this will be a very informative and worthwhile seminar.    Mark, along with other noted researchers at the University of Washington, Colorado State University, and the ECWMF in Redding, are beginining to unravel some of the vagaries of the NAO/AO and to develop the necessary tools to predict wintertime temperature and precipitation weeks ahead of time. I have asked Mark to start from scratch and spend some time on fairly rudimentary concepts pertaining to the NAO/AO and Sudden Stratoshperic Warmings.  He then will build up to his research and discuss where he thinks  short-term progress can be made in terms of skillful wintertime temperature and precipitation predictions.  Although many of you sat in on my NAO presentation from early this year, I can guarantee you that  attending his talk will be worth your while.   Mark's main focus will be to elaborate on what diagnostic tools and modeling schemes can be used to  anticipate certain extreme phases of the NAO/AO and the likelihood of Sudden Stratospheric Warmings. These  can, in turn, be used to something about the probability of cold air outbreaks or heavy snow episodes over parts  of North America and perhaps parts of the world (for example).  In the end, Joe and I plan to take Mark to lunch to discuss a possible research collaboration between him/ECWMF  and ENRON.   I will provide the conference room number and any additional information as we get closer to 26 September.

" Mike,  Please, take a look at this one.  Vince  -----Original Message----- From:  heather@e-acumen.com@ENRON [mailto:IMCEANOTES-heather+40e-acumen+2Ecom+40ENRON@ENRON.com]  Sent: Wednesday, September 05, 2001 12:07 PM To: Kaminski, Vince J Cc: Patrick, Christie Subject: Collaboration with Enron  Dear Vince,  I just sent this message to you and Christie Patrick, but I believe I had an incorrect e-mail address for you the first time.  Hopefully this message will reach you with no problems.  I hope this message finds you both very well!  As you may recall, I will be working for McKinsey and Company in Seattle starting this fall.  However, my interest in energy has continued to grow since Wharton's Tiger Team project with Enron last spring, and I decided to spend the second half of my summer working in the industry.  I am currently serving as interim Marketing Manager for e-Acumen, a venture- backed provider of high-end analytics, software, and advisory services to financial services companies trading weather derivatives and re-insurers dealing in catastrophic weather risk policies, as well as to power and energy industry clients.  Our primary investor is GE Power Systems, while some of our other investors include Woodside Fund, Perseus Capital, CreateLabs, and NewVista Capital.  I represent the Weather Risk Services group, which provides consensus weather forecasts--forecasts that consistently beat the National Weather Service Medium Range Forecast model--to financial, power and energy industry clients, of which Enron is one. In addition, the group provides load forecasts to many of the largest power traders in the country.  e-Acumen's newest product, WeatherAcumen, is a quantitative weather risk platform based on leading edge portfolio optimization analytics and simulation techniques.  WeatherAcumen mitigates weather risk by more accurately determining intrinsic values of weather derivatives, and features proprietary applications of a non-parametric Monte Carlo simulation engine that provides high fidelity indications of statistical arbitrage opportunities, resulting in more profitable hedging and trading strategies.  A WeatherAcumen demonstration is scheduled for September 14 with Mark Tawney, head of the weather desk, as well as Claudio Ribeiro, Joe Hrgovcic, and Michael Nguyen.   While they will be considering the functional benefits of such a platform to Enron's weather operations, I wanted to discuss a longer- term partnership opportunity with you that could benefit Enron from a marketing and profitability standpoint.  One possible model for collaboration could involve e-Acumen providing a direct link from the WeatherAcumen platform to EnronOnline in order to drive increased trading volume to your site.  WeatherAcumen's superior analytics, industry-leading weather backcasts and forecasts, and proprietary simulation technology allow weather derivatives, power, and gas traders to have greater price-discovery capabilities.  Even better, firms trading with a WeatherAcumen- enabled counterparty will have more confidence in posted prices, and thus be more willing to trade on your site.

It assumes:   1) Below $50.00 Shortfall will have restrictions on the whole number of shares (18MM shares);   2) Above $76.00 Peregrine will be fully rstricted.  3) Between $50.00 and $76.00 Peregrine will bear a restriction proportional to (S-50)/(76-50) on 18MM shares and      the Shorfall takes the restriction on the remaining shares. Let's fix some time today to discuss the approach and results.

With your help, we continue to expand the diversity of our host representatives. We especially thank those returning hosts, whose feedback was responsible for several program design changes which we believe will improve the program. Our goal is to continue to build our partnerships and to together create changes that benefit all. Feel free to call upon me to discuss any aspect of the program or special needs.  As a next step in the process, I am asking that you submit, by email, your project proposals no later then September 14, 2001 <mailto:FAP@management.wharton.upenn.edu>  These proposals do not have to be detailed, we just need to know what you are considering. We ask for proposals at this early date because some hosts have expressed the desire to get faculty involved early in the process. We think that is a good idea so faculty will begin to review the proposals in September. This will allow faculty to get involved earlier in the process and the final project scope will be more of a host/faculty collaboration.  As a reminder, projects should be cross-functional in nature with 3, if not 4 of the business function areas; finance, accounting, operations, marketing, management and strategy. Because of the more integrative nature of Tiger Teams,  projects should have strategic implications. Faculty will happily assist hosts in developing these project aspects.  To ensure that the projects yield significant benefits for all participants, we ask hosts to appoint at least one on-site contact person to help define the project objectives, interact with the faculty and student team representatives.  Our tentative FAP calendar can be reviewed at the website: http://fap.wharton.upenn.edu/TigerHost/tiger_host_overview.htm  If there are only particular dates for which the host representatives are available to come to campus for the Kick-Off, Mid-Project Review and Final Presentations, please schedule them as soon as possible, as they will be done on a first-come, first serve basis. Feel free to contact us should you have any questions. We look forward to working with you. Again, thank you for your support of the Wharton School.

I hope that both of you, your friends and family  are okay and safe. Along with other professionals in the financial industry, my  colleagues and I at GARP, have been affected by this tragedy.   I have had an opportunity to speak to the vast  number of 2002 Convention speakers since yesterday and the overwhelming response  has been to proceed with the Convention. Indeed, there seems to be a determined  effort not to let what happened last week bring the financial world to a  standstill. I also believe that this is a time that NY requires all the support  it can get, both emotionally and financially. As such, I am searching for  new venues within Manhattan, but this is a very difficult task, as you can  imagine. As soon as I have any news about venue and possible change of dates I  will be in touch.   Barring any unforeseen events or meetings, I would  like to know whether you can confirm that you will still be taking part as a  speaker at the GARP 2002 Convention? I, and a great number of financial risk  professionals that I have mentioned the workshop to, are still very keen to have  you there. As such, I would very much like to have the energy risk management  agenda in the next few days.    Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have  any questions or queries. I look forward to your  response and hope that you are able to join us and your peers at GARP  2002.

I would very much like to talk to your Director about opportunities at Enron.  To be honest, I am approaching Enron from several different points in order to pinpoint the area that best suits my abilities and sense of direction (kind of mirroring the internal process that you would use to move between groups within Enron).  As Enron is the only large corporation that I am seriously considering, talks with people such as yourself are invaluable in helping me find areas of commonality between the company's and my own goals.  Makes for a realistic set of expectations on both sides.  My resume is attached in Word format, but sending emails from home via the Rice server sometimes buggers the attachments.

Zimin     -----Original Message----- From: Nordstrom, Mary  Sent: Wednesday, September 19, 2001 10:52 AM To: Lu, Zimin; Lee, Bob Subject: FW: Izzy Nelken     Over the past year, I've been doing a lot of work to one of the largest Chicago market making firms in equity options. The project has to do with the ""Market Microstructure"".  With high degree of accuracy we can predict where the stock price is going to go in the next 15 seconds to 60 seconds. This technique can NOT be used to predict where the stock will be tomorrow or even in the next hour. As these are only short term predictions, the changes in the stock are usually small. Therefore, this technique is of no use to day traders. However, suppose you need to buy stocks anyway. For example, if you need to delta hedge an option position and buy some stock, the model might tell you to wait a few minutes and save a few pennies.  Every time the stock moves and the trader has to modify the position, they consult our model and decide on their action: buy now or wait. Of course, this also works for ""sell now or wait"". Indeed, we found out that they save about 3-4 cents per stock trade. The market makers typically trade hundreds of millions of stocks a year so this is quite interesting to them.  We also have a project with one of the major US banks to apply this to foreign currency (forex) markets.  At this stage, it would be interesting to adapt this project to other markets. For example crude oil comes to mind. The project involves two stages: a) A feasibility study to check if this is possible to do. b) Building a real time system to give signals to the traders.  I think we can do step (a) independently without any commitment on your part.  We would then apply our models and see if we can come up with anything interesting. We have access to ""tick data"" through a commercial service called ""e-signal"". I believe that it is reasonably good. If you have access to better tick data then it would be helpful for us to obtain several days (perhaps two weeks) of tick data (bids, asks and trades which are time stamped).

"Dear Vince,   We have been working on the curriculum for some of the educational programs to be offered by the Energy Markets Institute that Arthur Warga and I discussed with you in the summer.  I am attaching (tentative) curricula for two important programs: (1) A graduate certificate in Energy Finance, (2) A 5-year BBA/MS program in Energy Finance.  Briefly, the certificate is a 5-course for-credit program that is available to people with sufficient basic background in finance, economics, statistics and mathematics.  This certificate includes coursework in accounting issues specific to the energy industry, basic aspects of energy sources and the organization and regulation of energy industry, forecasting and time-series econometric methodologies, basics of financial engineering and derivatives, real-options and project analysis as it applies to the energy industry, and energy derivatives and risk-managament.  The 5-year program is more ambitious. It seeks to provide a broad but rigorous curriculum for future energy industry professionals and managers. In the undergraduate component students take rigorous courses in math, probability and statistics, economics, chemistry and physics, and accounting and finance. This is conceived to be an ""elite"" and highly demanding program where students have to handle the more demanding courses in a variety of areas.  The 5th or graduate year of the program is given over to the energy certificate and additional graduate courses in finance and accounting.  I know you are extremely busy, but it would be very helpful to get your reaction (even at a broad level) to these programs and the type of courses that are envisaged.  We view these programs to potentially form the core of the educational activities of the Institute, but the next step would be to develop more specialized programs (of shorter duration) aimed at professionals already working on challenging problems in the industry. We are in the process of setting up the Institute and developing its governance and administrative structure. I will give you more details very shortly.  On another topic, Darrell Duffie (with whom I interacted with a lot during our student days at Stanford) will be coming to present a seminar at the Bauer College on January 10. We very much hope to see you and the Enron group there.  Finally, I hope that you and all of your loved ones and colleagues are as well as possible in light of the recent tragedies.

"Vince:  I am disappointed to hear that the interest on the part of your internal users has waned.  We have made a lot of progress since you and they last reviewed it, completing and finalizing our  .  short term North American gas model and data base (which endogenizes storage into a Continent-wide zero arbitrage solution)  .  long term North American gas model and data base (which drills wells and builds pipe and calculates equilibrium given such decisions)  .  short term North American electric model and data base  .  long term North American electric model and data base (which tells you precisely where on a nodal basis all forward power plant construction will and should occur.  The model builds the right amount of capacity in the right place at the right time)  .  Western European gas model and data base  .  World Gas Trade model and data base  .  World Oil Model and data base  We are striving to have the definitive economic modeling system so that companies like Enron can incorporate and proprietize your own ""private knowledge"" in combination with our general knowledge.  Vince, I wanted to raise another issue with you.  Now that MarketPoint is developed and operational and (hopefully) the leading technology available for dynamic microeconomic market modeling, I perceive that that it has more value as an acquisition play by a major player such as Enron than it does as ""just another commoditized model"" supported by a ""play for pay"" consulting firm such as Altos who is continually hounding internal users for license and consulting fees.  My goal from the outset has been to use my traditional consulting base to capitalize the best tool in the industry and when the tool is complete to seek acquisition or investment by someone who can make a lot of money by proprietizing it.  After a substantial development period here in the Silicon Valley (a very good place to develop software--that is why we were here), MarketPoint is just now arriving at the point of seeking equity investment or outright acquisition by a major player who can proprietize and benefit internally from MarketPoint as well as potentially enhancing the customer value from e-commerce verticals such as enrononline.com.  When you and I had breakfast at the Hyatt about a year ago, you expressed the sentiment that Enron wants to be able to proprietize and husband technology such as MarketPoint (rather than seeing it licensed to everyone) so that you can comfortably augment it with your competitive advantage.  We are at the point where we want to talk seriously with you and a selected few others about that.  That is why I want to speak with you next Friday.  1.  Could we really sell MarketPoint to a single entity such as Enron and take it off the market?  Without elaborating, our licenses are structured so that we can do that.  2.  Is the MarketPoint genie out of the bottle with licensees; would they know how to replicate it?  Not a chance, we have protected the source code and the critical technical documentation and concentrated it three people in the world.  (They issue technical tasks on a piecemeal basis.)  It is extremely tough to do it.  3.  Can MarketPoint run tens, hundreds, or thousands of fundamentally based forward market scenarios and thereby generate a continuously refreshed, extensive forward joint probability density function over price?  We have just completed development of our Enterprise/LAN version, which fully parallelizes our calculations and renders the number of processors and the MIPS we can access over the intranet or internet essentially limitless.  MarketPoint can now automatically ""farm out"" its microeconomic calculations across processors on a huge network and make all its calculations in parallel.  This means that you can actually run a continuous, fundamentally based, automatic-feed forward probability density function calculation over gas price or over electricity price by region by time and a few seconds or minutes depending on how many processors reside within your network.  Without parallelization, this simply cannot happen.  Think of the magnitude of competitive advantage this could bring to Enron if you can proprietize it.  You are one of a handful of organizations who could really monitize that.  4.  How large or detailed a model can you run?  With its tremendous degree of parallelization (under our algorithm, every node can be a parallel activity), our LAN Enterprise Version allows models of essentially unlimited size to be solved through parallelization very quickly and efficiently.  The models are highly modularized (individual network nodes linked together) and therefore can be expanded and run efficiently.  5.  Are the MarketPoint development risks gone?  Yes, we have been offering MarketPoint under stand alone commercial license for a few months.  The gas, electricity, and oil models all demonstrably work, and we have a number of test and demonstration cases.  I have been waiting until this was true before looking for an investor.  While there are maintenance costs and tasks to be done forever, there are no more known development costs or risks.  6.  Does MarketPoint work for other commodities?  Yes.  MarketPoint can help you avoid difficulties of the past across a broad range of commodities and guide your businesses in such commodity areas with workable, fundamental models of those industries.  MarketPoint is designed to give you early warning flags and guidance in commodity oriented business including but not limited to energy.  7.  What would be your role?  If Enron proprietized MarketPoint, I have the feeling you would probably inherit technical responsibility and could safely leverage MarketPoint into your group, secure in the knowledge that it is truly proprietary to you and Enron and would not be in the hands of Enron competitors.  I should think that if Enron were interested, someone else's budget would acquire it and you would get it. Yours is one of a handful of groups in the world with whom I would want to work because you have the sophistication to make progress.  8.  Is it really realistic to sell MarketPoint?  It is realistic.  Only two people (Mark Nickeson and I) own over 90 percent of the capital stock in MarketPoint, and there are no outstanding options, encumberances, or other impediments.  We own it outright, and we have the ability and disposition to move.  That is the beauty of capitalizing it as we have with consulting dollars--we paid people with MONEY rather than with stock, and we ended up owning the stock and the flexibility and value such ownership affords.  We don't have to deal with employees or venture capitalists; we have autonomy of action.  These are the issues I would like to speak with you about next Friday if you are interested.  I would anticipate that this is a not decision that you alone will make within Enron, but I wanted to lay this out for you and if you are interested and amenable work together to present it to the right people in your organization.  I need to get started in the right way with the right Enron people, and I would appreciate your support if you are so disposed.  There is one additional issue as well.  Would you, Krishna, and your guys be prepared to enthusiastically endorse MarketPoint if I were to interest an internal Enron group in using or licensing it?  (If so, I would be prepared make MarketPoint available to you and your group under their license and train you to use it at no additional cost to you.  I am confident if I could get MarketPoint into your hands, it would be win-win for you and for us.)  The reason I am asking is that I have the opportunity to brief one of your operating groups who has expressed interest (through another consulting company) in one of the MarketPoint models.  Before doing that, I want to be confident that you, Krishna, and your group are enthusiastic supporters and endorsers of MarketPoint if one of your inhouse groups is interested in spending the resources to move forward.  Please advise by email or when we get together.  All the best.  Give me an email shout or voice shout at my cell 650.218.3069 on Monday if you can.  Thanks for your consideration.

To that end, I have asked Wanda Curry to lead a cross-functional team (the ""Operational Risk Committee""), which will be jointly accountable for meeting this commitment. I would like to have representatives from Enron Assurance Services, RAC, Research, Information Technology, GRMO and Arthur Anderson.    Enron's primary objective for monitoring its exposure to operational risk is to (a) identify the derivation of operational risk exposures and (b) improve the Company's systems and processes to mitigate such risk. The guidelines for operational risk assessment are essentially undeveloped.  It will be our challenge to identify, assess, categorize, quantify and mitigate exposure to operational risk.     The risk capital allocation process includes the consideration of operational risk.  Initially, this assessment will be based on a qualitative view of the business unit's internal processes, people and systems. The initial goal, for completion prior to year-end 2001, is to establish a baseline and/or report card to convey a sense for where we are now.  It is Enron's objective, as reflected in the Risk Management Policy, to increase the sophistication of risk measurement for operational risks through documented qualitative assessments and quantitative measurements.    A list of additional objectives to be addressed by the cross functional team has been prepared by Wanda.  These include:   Develop a qualitative operational risk assessment approach and implement.  This approach should enable a quick review of key functions and standards to identify weaknesses, monitor progress over time, and provide management with a representation of operational risk. Assess and improve integrity of daily risk reports, i.e. require confirmation that all books are captured, aggregated and processed through RisktRAC, CreditAg, and Infinity applications Ascertain the extent of spreadsheet usage across Enron and develop the ability to monitor NOP, V@R, and MTM for spreadsheets separately, i.e. a Spreadsheet DPR.  Work with GRMO to develop ""rules of use"" for financial valuation models and spreadsheet ""books"" Utilize the existing RMS database and develop the ability to monitor intercompany - interbook activity (initially for forward positions only) and report variances  Recommend metrics for quantitative measurement of operational risk Access need for additional or improved risk databases  Wanda will be contacting each of you to identify your designated operational risk contact that will participate on this cross-functional team.

I feel strongly that I cannot support the valuations my group has produced so far for the LJM/Raptor related transactions without examination of all the related legal documents.  I feel that we did solid work based on verbal information,  but I cannot guarantee the quality of the final product without looking at the contracts. These transactions are too complex and controversial to bypass due diligence requirements  that you would expect from any professional.

"Dear Vince  Thank you for your e-mail. I will certainly use the information I sent you for the brochure.  Regarding the workshop, it is now a very pressing matter of time as all the other parts of the convention programme have been sent off to the typesetters and printers. The workshop agenda I sent you was based on what Mark Williams will be presenting on, so I very much require your half of the workshop. I agree that you should add more quantification aspects; can you please provide me with some similar bullet points for the workshop as those I sent you.  Just one final issue, should the energy risk workshop title focus specifically on establishing a strong credit risk function, or just establishing a strong risk function? Mark's bullet's indicate a credit risk function, so if you wish to broaden this, please make you bullets reflect this.  I will call you later today to discuss this further, though please understand that this is a rather pressing matter.  I eagerly await your response in due course.

For the workshop, I can add more quantitative perspective. For example, I can focus on estimating probabilities of default and on measuring future potential credit exposure due to price fluctuations over time.

" Hi, Vince Just got off the phone with Andy Lewis, a trader for the Midwest. We had so much similarities in terms of orientation, starting from the backroom and moving to the backroom.

"Vince, I hope this e-mail finds you well.  The recent award of the Nobel Prize in Economics to Stiglitz, Spence and Akerlof  has set me thinking. Lots of what Enron does addresses asymmetrical markets by improving information. Is it a stretch to apply their theories to energy? Do our risk management tools help equalize the amount of information in the marketplace?  For example, Stiglitz says that insurance deductibles is the way that insurance carriers get customers to reveal their potential liability. Someone who is more likely to be in poor health or have accidents will seek lower deductibles. Do any of Enron's products help us, or the energy markets, reveal information that creates not only a more effective market but a market that works?   If there is something substantial to this, I'd like to write about the subject for Exchange, the wholesale customer magazine. If it is just an interesting observation (that's true), perhaps we'd run it in eBiz.

I hope that your experiences of the past few days will not put you off paying further visits to this land.

I tried and tried to get through but all the numbers at the consulate were continuously busy. Eventually, we agreed that it might be best if handled from the Brazilian side of Enron. I understand from her that you have finally been able to get to Sao Paulo, so I hope that the business you went to discuss has gone successfully.  I imagine that by now you may have been introduced to a good Brazilian churrasco, tasted some real coffee, and perhaps sampled some of the many tropical fruits that Brazil boasts of (speaking from a culinary perspective). If you haven't yet been to any of the Brazilian restaurants here in Houston, I would be happy to introduce you to them when you return. I wish I could recommend good places to visit in Sao Paulo, but it is not really a city for tourists. If you had more time, I could suggest some art museums, a visit to the municipal theatre, or some relaxation in one of Sao Paulo's parks; a trip down to the coast would also be worthwhile.  Well, I wish you a safe return journey and look forward to seeing you back safe and sound. You were greatly missed yesterday morning at our Bosses Day Breakfast.

" Hi Vince  Have you had chance to make any further progress on the Energy Risk book outline?  I look forward to hearing from you.  Kind regards Sam  Samantha Whittaker John Wiley & Sons Ltd Direct T: +44 1243 770643     Vince.J.Kaminski@enron.com on 13/09/2001 16:56:42  To:   IMCEANOTES-SWhittak+40wiley/2Eco/2Euk/40ENRON@ENRON.com cc:   vkaminski@aol.com Subject:  RE: Your articles + weather contact   Sam,  Thanks for your kind words. I am an old prof (or I used to be one in my previous life) so I should know how to teach.  I am working on an outline of a book on energy derivatives and I should send you the first draft next week..  Vince      -----Original Message-----    From:   SWhittak@wiley.co.uk@ENRON  [mailto:IMCEANOTES-SWhittak+40wiley+2Eco+2Euk+40ENRON@ENRON.com]      Sent:   Tuesday, September 11, 2001 9:50 AM    To:     Kaminski, Vince J    Subject:  Your articles + weather contact      Dear Vince     Many thanks for both the contact name for weather derivatives and the    chapters and magazine extracts (unfortunately I am still waiting for the    Risk book to arrive).  I really enjoyed reading them and think you have    an    excellent pedagogical writing style.  From what I have seen I would very    much like to encourage you to put a book proposal together on Energy    Risk    Management.  Saying that, I would still be interested in discussing the    idea of a book on credit derivatives  for the energy market...but    perhaps    this could follow!     My reading of your chapter on Exotic Options is that it walked a good    balance between serving the needs of the risk manager, whilst also    providing some of the more technical material for the 'quants' in an    appendix.  This sort of level would probably be appropriate for a new    book    on the topic.  I thought your 'Concluding Remarks: Practical    Considerations' really interesting stuff and something that might work    really well if it were embedded into the main body of the text?  The key    to    such a book is that it is written by an energy market expert who can    bring    a wealth of experience and insight into how to structure risk management    products specifically for this market.     The panel sections (a Risk book house style?) worked well, but one could    structure to differentiate between case vignettes, 'hints and tips',    definitions and so on.     As I say, I would very much welcome the opportunity of receiving a book    proposal from you.  This could be based around the structure of your    lecture course?  Do you think you would be able to provide me with a    table    of contents, with abstracts under each chapter heading as a starting    point?     I very much hope so and very much look forward to hearing from you!     With kind regards    Sam     Samantha Whittaker    Senior Publishing Editor, Finance    John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

"Vince,  Steve Leppard suggested that I contact you about the possibility of a position in Houston. I worked as an analyst under Steve in London's Metal Analytics group. I was planning on returning to the States before they announced the redundancies in Europe, and the redundancy program made a move back to Houston all the more appealing. I am a first-year analyst with a statistics background, and I would be very interested in working for Enron in Houston.   Steve has told me that he would be happy to give me a recommendation. If you know of a position which might be suitable, I would be very happy to speak to you at your convenience.  Thank you in advance for your consideration.

"Vince hello... The industry partner meeting for the ET Program has been rescheduled as a half day event and dinner on Thursday, November 29, and there is an impact conference on ""Managing Knowledge Assets"" the following day (Nov. 30). You and any interested colleagues are welcome to attend one or both events. As you know, these are part of our research activities and there are no conference fees. RSVP information and agendas are enclosed below. I would especially urge you to pass along this invitation to anyone at Enron concerned with intellectual property/patents, since the impact conference on Nov. 30 will focus on some new developments in this area that may be of special interest and value. Within 2 weeks after the event, we will post conference summaries on our website, for those who cannot attend (<http://emertech.wharton.upenn.edu/>). We are hosting and combining 2 EVENTS and a DINNER - the Industry Partner Workshop and Dinner on Thursday, Nov. 29 - ""Developing New Technologies in a Tight Economy"" - and the Wharton impact conference on the following day (Friday, Nov. 30 - ""Managing Knowledge Assets: Changing Rules and Emerging Strategies.""

Best regards, Michael Tomczyk, Managing Director, Emerging Technologies Program (Mack Ctr) _________________________________________ Wharton 2001 Industry Partner Workshop & Dinner - THURSDAY, NOVEMBER. 29, 2001 MANAGING TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT IN A TOUGH ECONOMY: DOING LESS WITH LESS AND GETTING MORE When markets sag and earnings are squeezed, top management attention shifts from growth prospects to immediate productivity gains. Yet technologies keep progressing, disruptive innovations challenge incumbents and a robust development portfolio is needed to keep growing. How are leading firms managing the tension between the immediate pressure to conserve and the long-run need to innovate? During this timely workshop, the partners in the ET program will learn from each other how to ratchet up their development productivity with innovative processes, organization designs and partnership arrangements.

Knowledge may be the most important source of competitive advantage for a firm, but capturing the potential gains is a continuing challenge. Firms are filing patent applications at an unprecedented rate, while struggling to keep up with accelerating development cycles and shrinking lead times. Emerging technologies, changing legal interpretations and growing administrative burdens on the patent system are creating a new and unfamiliar context for the management of intellectual property. In response, firms are rethinking their strategies for realizing the rewards from their innovation. The Mack Center at the Wharton School has assembled thought leaders from leading companies, government and academia to address issues such as the following: - What strategies are firms using to create, protect and use their knowledge assets? - Do mechanisms such as secrecy, control of complementary assetsand lead time play an important role as a substitute or supplement for patent protection? - How is the U.S. patent and trademark office responding to the remarkable growth in patenting? Should they be protecting not only inventions but also ways of distributing and selling them? How should they deal with applications for patents on sequences of the human genome? - In a world where technology is developed and employed globally, what are the prospects for international harmonization of intellectual property laws and practice? - Are the patent office and the courts up to the task of creating and effectively enforcing clear intellectual property rights for emerging technologies?

To achieve   this goal, the BFS organizes every two years an International Congress.      The scientific program of the 2002 BFS Congress consists of plenary   talks and contributed papers. The invited plenary talks will give an   overview of the latest important developments in the field. They will   also present new ideas, directions and methodologies from Finance,   Economics, Econometrics and Mathematics and, discuss pressing problems   in the Finance and Insurance industries. The contributed papers will   complement the plenary talks with recent results and advances.       The overall scope is to create a unique interdisciplinary forum for   discussion of new concepts, incite stronger interaction across the   fields, and, at the same time, define new directions for the future   development of Mathematical Finance.

"Wolak makes some good points.  In ERCOT, Enron is in support of nodal pricing.  I would not go so far as to say we are pushing for PJM's implementation, however, but for a market with nodal prices (and unilateral bids - aka unbalanced schedules, congestion reflect by price differentials, etc).  I was unaware PJM had such great power to alter bids.  This is something we don't want, and something for which I am not aware we have advocated.  Perhaps in Enron's promotion of locational prices, it has been retold as PJM-style locational prices.  Given that PJM is the most commonly cited example of locational prices, it does not surprise me to have the sloppiness in discussions that could lead to the rumors.

Vince   -----Original Message----- From:  ""Frank A. Wolak"" <wolak@zia.Stanford.EDU>@ENRON   Sent: Friday, October 19, 2001 4:28 PM To: Kaminski, Vince J Subject:    Vince,    I've been hearing rumors that Enron has decided to endorse the nodal pricing model as implemented in PJM. I just wanted to warn you that I'm not sure this is in Enron's long-term interest at all.  Let me explain why.  Feel free to give me a call if you'd like to talk more about this.    First, let me say that I firmly believe in locational pricing and specifically pricing congestion.  However, the way that PJM implements nodal pricing is to eliminate as much price volatility and reduce the transparency of the market.  Specifically, the PJM tariff gives the ISO the ability to mitigate to cost plus a %10 adder the bids of any market participant that the ISO deems is out of merit in one of the three zones in region.  (The fact that a nodal market is talking about zones should give you cause for alarm.) Then the ISO takes this mitigated bid and re-runs its price-setting software to compute new nodal prices.  The way I have (somewhat unfairly) decribed this price-setting process is that the PJM ISO decides what prices it would like for a given day and mitigates bids until it gets them.  This is not a transparent market, nor one where it makes any sense to buy the risk management services that Enron provides.  The only price volatility you have to worry about in the PJM market is that kind that comes about if they need imports into their control area to meet demand.  Under these circumstances, you need to pay the imports whatever is necessary to get them to come to your market.    However, bear in mind FERC's desire to make a large RTO on the East Coast.  This will effectively mean little imports to the East Coast RTO, so all bids can be mitigated at the discretion of the ISO.  Paying market-clearing prices to cost-of-service mitigated bids is just paying too much to eliminate price volatility. It effectively kills off the development of risk management at the wholesale and retail level.  Power marketing becomes much less profitable because retailers know you can always buy at cost-mitigated prices.    In short, the PJM model is not market.  It is just an alternative form of regulation that is politically attractive because it reduces price volatility, but it is not good for consumers or traders because they just get a higher cost form of regulation than traditional cost-of-service regulation.

In ERCOT, Enron is in support of nodal pricing.  I would not go so far as to say we are pushing for PJM's implementation, however, but for a market with nodal prices (and unilateral bids - aka unbalanced schedules, congestion reflect by price differentials, etc).  I was unaware PJM had such great power to alter bids.  This is something we don't want, and something for which I am not aware we have advocated.  Perhaps in Enron's promotion of locational prices, it has been retold as PJM-style locational prices.  Given that PJM is the most commonly cited example of locational prices, it does not surprise me to have the sloppiness in discussions that could lead to the rumors.

Vince    -----Original Message-----  From:  ""Frank A. Wolak"" <wolak@zia.Stanford.EDU>@ENRON    Sent: Friday, October 19, 2001 4:28 PM  To: Kaminski, Vince J  Subject:     Vince,     I've been hearing rumors that Enron has decided to endorse  the nodal pricing model as implemented in PJM.  I just wanted to warn you that I'm not sure  this is in Enron's long-term interest at all.  Let me explain  why.  Feel free to give me a call if you'd like to talk  more about this.     First, let me say that I firmly believe in locational pricing  and specifically pricing congestion.  However, the way that PJM  implements nodal pricing is to eliminate as much price volatility  and reduce the transparency of the market.  Specifically, the  PJM tariff gives the ISO the ability to mitigate to cost plus a  %10 adder the bids of any market participant that the ISO deems  is out of merit in one of the three zones in region.  (The fact  that a nodal market is talking about zones should give you cause for alarm.)  Then the ISO takes this mitigated bid and re-runs its price-setting  software to compute new nodal prices.  The way I have (somewhat  unfairly) decribed this price-setting process is that the  PJM ISO decides what prices it would like  for a given day and mitigates bids until it gets them.  This is not  a transparent market, nor one where it makes any sense to buy  the risk management services that Enron provides.  The  only price volatility you have to worry about in the PJM market is  that kind that comes about if they need imports into their control area  to meet demand.  Under these circumstances, you need to pay the  imports whatever is necessary to get them to come to your market.     However, bear in mind FERC's desire to make a large RTO on the  East Coast.  This will effectively mean little imports  to the East Coast RTO, so all bids can be mitigated at  the discretion of the ISO.  Paying market-clearing prices to cost-of-service  mitigated bids is just paying too much to eliminate price volatility.  It effectively kills off the development of risk management at  the wholesale and retail level.  Power marketing becomes much less  profitable because retailers know you can always buy at cost-mitigated  prices.     In short, the PJM model is not market.  It is just an alternative  form of regulation that is politically attractive because it reduces  price volatility, but it is not good for consumers or traders because they just  get a higher cost form of regulation than traditional cost-of-service  regulation. You pay market-clearing prices to cost-of-service  mitigated bids, but under regulation you could just pay cost-of-service  prices and eliminate the infra-marginal profits to low cost generators.     As we discussed during our dinner, I think the two biggest sources  of benefits from re-structuring will come from getting the demand-side  involved in the market and from more efficient risk management.  A  necessary condition for both of these to occur is prices that reflect  actual conditions in the market (including the extent of market power  exercised).  Masking these signals dulls any incentive for market  participants to make the investment necessary to management.  The PJM  model is just way to have a market in name without achieving any  significant benefits to consumers or energy traders.

Vince is amenable to letting us have one of his managers.  However, because is group is stretched thin and he wants to keep his headcount flat, he would want to hire a replacement and charge the manager we get to us.

"Hi, Vince,  This is Slav Fain - Oracle DBA  and I hope you remember me. We've met at the infosession in Berkley and have talked about Houston, rotation program or other possible openings Enron might have.  Today I've saw an add for the Junior DBA position in Houston and I was wondering  if it might be in your company. I beleive I told you, that I'm pretty open for different position. I was doing a lot of development projects in Berkley and enjoyed it. I've also found DBA work also very challenging and rewarding. I would be very intersted in joining the rotation program to see different possibilities and aspects of IT department.  I'm opening for relocation and I think with knowledge, experience and my enthusiasm to learn and ability to work under tight timeline - I think I can be a good match for Enron.

"Dear Vince,  I was really disappointed when I did not hear from Lee Ferrell after he interviewed me back in May. Since you were so nice and very helpful, I am wondering if you could assist me once again in landing a job at ENRON.

Would you be able to help me out one more time to get in contact with the right people? I would really appreciate it.  Here is the description of this position (and my updated resume).

In my continued discussions with the financial community yesterday and today, it became clear that this move was required to restore investor confidence.  Jeff has unparalleled qualifications and a deep and thorough understanding of Enron.  He is already on the job and hard at work on the issues before us.  Andy Fastow will be on a leave of absence from the company.    Jeff had been serving as chairman and CEO of Enron Industrial Markets. He joined Enron in 1994 and spent three years in the London office as chief financial officer for Enron's European operations.  Upon returning to the U.S., Jeff was executive vice president of finance and treasurer for Enron Corp.  In 2000, he was named president and chief operating officer of Enron Net Works.  I know all of you are concerned about the continuing decline in our share price.  I am too, and we are working very hard to turn it around.  Appointing Jeff as CFO is one important step in that process.  But most of the solution involves just continuing to do our jobs with excellence.  The fundamentals of our business are strong, and I think the market will begin to see that as we continue to perform.  Please join me in giving Jeff your full support, and thank you for all of your continued hard work.",vkaminski@aol.com,j.kaminski@enron.com,FW: Jeff McMahon Named CFO,2001-10-25 08:08:38-07:00,sent

"Vince,   As you have seen in the write-ups I have been sending you, we have established the Energy Markets Institute here to provide a world class recruitment, specialized training, and research resource for the energy industry.  The clear challenge now is to deliver on this as expeditiously as possible, and we need help and input from industry leaders. We have set up an Energy Executive Committee to work with us on making this a valuable resource for the industry. So far, Bruce Williamson (CEO, Duke Energy Global Markets), Gerald McElvey (Upstrean Controller, ExxonMobil), Fran Keeth (Exec. VP, Shell Oil), Donna Pedersen-McGinnis (VP, Dynegy), Bruce Sukaly (Sr. VP, Cinergy), Bob Peebler (Retired, Halliburton) have agreed to be on the committee.  The committee is being put together by Lane Sloan (Retired, Shell Oil).   Both Lane and I very much want to have your input. Enron is a leading energy firm (and from my perspective, it is the future of the industry). So we would like Enron to be represented, and I personally would be delighted and gratified to have your advice and evaluation.  We plan to organize subcommittees dealing with Education, Research, and Trading---so it may just involve two meetings a year.  We are looking at November 14 (5-7 p.m.) for the first meeting of the committee.  Please let me know if you would agree to be on the Committee.   We are now in the process of recruiting top-name in energy-finance for the Bauer chair (endowment $3 million).

Also, I am currently doing a project on assessing the intrinsic value of Enron and its business-operating environment to augment my knowledge of Enron in particular and the energy markets in general.

As a Computational Finance student with a chemical engineering background, I am very interested in pursuing my career with Enron as this will give me the opportunity to employ the skills that I have developed during the course of my education and experience. I am currently working on an external project with Professor John O'Brien, on the Effect of Convexity on pricing Eurodollar swaps and I am confident that this experience would help me in understanding the effects of volatility on derivative prices, which is a fundamental component in the energy markets. Also, I am currently doing a project on assessing the intrinsic value of Enron and its business-operating environment to augment my knowledge of Enron in particular and the energy markets in general. My education, as well as my experiences have helped in honing my quantitative, analytical and computing skills, and have given me a significant insight into the global trading industry.  I am enclosing my resume along with this mail. As mentioned in our conversation, I would like to pursue a career in Energy trading and research.  Hoping to hear from you soon.

"Vince, I was just thinking about the subject project that you were trying to get off the ground (even though no commercial support existed!) that I worked on initially.  I know you were trying to get this done before I arrived and then followed my effort with at least one other person. I think the reason we could not complete a comprehensive project was we did not have the mandate from the CEO office to do it so that relevant commercial and functional entities can provide the required information.  Perhaps the reason there were no major thrust from the management was that most people knew the answer was going to be less than desirable.  However, such information would have correctly priced the risk (to the shareholder not its agents--the management) so that we could have better managed the $20 Billion or so company specific (taking systemic market down turn, including telecom exposure, out) market value that perished.    Great intuition on your part in trying to get such a risk measurement tool implemented. I wonder if you were able to advance that project and I now wonder if Greg Whaley would be interested sponsoring it from his office.  I would love to be the 'commercial' lead interfacing with you to get such a project done now since it may help us with relevant (risk worthy) disclosure.

The clear challenge now is to deliver on this as expeditiously as possible, and we need help and input from industry leaders. We have set up an Energy Executive Committee to work with us on making this a valuable resource for the industry. So far, Bruce Williamson (CEO, Duke Energy Global Markets), Gerald McElvey (Upstrean Controller, ExxonMobil), Fran Keeth (Exec. VP, Shell Oil), Donna Pedersen-McGinnis (VP, Dynegy), Bruce Sukaly (Sr. VP, Cinergy), Bob Peebler (Retired, Halliburton) have agreed to be on the committee.  The committee is being put together by Lane Sloan (Retired, Shell Oil).   Both Lane and I very much want to have your input. Enron is a leading energy firm (and from my perspective, it is the future of the industry). So we would like Enron to be represented, and I personally would be delighted and gratified to have your advice and evaluation.  We plan to organize subcommittees dealing with Education, Research, and Trading---so it may just involve two meetings a year.  We are looking at November 14 (5-7 p.m.) for the first meeting of the committee.  Please let me know if you would agree to be on the Committee.   We are now in the process of recruiting top-name in energy-finance for the Bauer chair (endowment $3 million).

" Hot Off the Cyberpress! A new Grant's publication is now available at www.grantspub.com. Here are highlights of the newest   THE EPIDEMIC THAT WASN'T     This country was founded in terror. The 17th-century Puritan settlers confronted the New England winter and King Philip's braves. They lived in fear of the pope and his legions of Frenchmen. In the summer of the signing of the Declaration of Independence, smallpox posed a greater danger to American patriots than the redcoats did. . . .  AT ANY RATE     On the train from Narita Airport to downtown Tokyo, a uniformed girl sells drinks from a cart. Reaching the end of an aisle, she pauses, turns to face the inattentive passengers, smiles broadly, performs a deliberate, steep bow and wheels her drinks into the next car. Commerce works differently in a society in which rank and deference sometimes precede supply and demand.   YIELDS WITH HAIR     The bear market in credit has created opportunity as well as loss, distress, apprehension and a general flu-like malaise. Following are some interest-generating investment ideas contributed by knowledgeable high-yield practitioners, starting with one from Anand Iyer, head of convertible-bond research at Morgan Stanley.   CROSSED UP     Not one visionary expected that anything so pedestrian as debt would thwart the technological destiny of Global Crossing, the Western Union of the 21st century. Yet the company hangs by a thread.   DATING GUIDE     Asserting that the U.S. has entered a new age of productivity growth, defenders of the bullish faith are fond of citing the 2.5% annual growth rung up in the golden years, 1995-2000. This record they compare to the lamentable 1.3% annual growth posted in 1973-95.      Grantspub.com Dispatch is sent free to all registered subscribers and e- mail recipients.

"Vince,  I was thinking that max (negative)  potential exposure for different counterparties could occur for different scenarios and so combining max potential exposure across counterparties may overstate cash needs.  If overall scenario for overall max (negative) potential exposure is considered, then we will pick up some high exposures and some low exposures, which may be fine.  Alternately, why not tweak the potential exposure program to do deterministic shifts of one sigma and two sigma and assuming one factor model and perfect correlation across commodities. Then the negative mtm values can be compared to collateral already outstanding. This method does not guarantee that we will get large exposures, but is easy to explain.  Another thing to check with Winston is that the program does not automatically zero out negative exposures. If it does, then we may have to flip the sign for all positions, get the exposures, then flip back the sign. Then compare to collateral outstanding.

This year the walk will be held o= n Sunday, October 28, 2001, at Greenspoint Mall. =20 As some of you may know, Mike has diabetes and JDRF is an organization that=  is very important to him.  There are two types of diabetes and Mike has Ty= pe 1, insulin-dependent diabetes which is also known as Juvenile Diabetes. =  The other type of diabetes is Type 2, adult-onset diabetes that can often = be controlled with a combination of diet, exercise and oral medication.  Ev= ery day Mike must prick his finger to test his blood sugar at least 7 times= , in addition to giving himself at least 3 or 4 injections of insulin.  Jus= t think of it, at least 10 times a day Mike has to stick himself with a nee= dle to manage his disease.  I don't know about you, but I am a wimp if I ha= ve to get a shot just once every few years and I can't even begin to imagin= e what it must be like to stick yourself over 70 times in just one week!  B= ut for Mike it is not just one day or one week, it is every day of every we= ek for the rest of his life -- until a cure is found.  Diabetics can never = take a break from their disease.  It requires constant management of their = food intake, monitoring of their blood sugar and the administration of the = proper amount of insulin.  If diabetes is not properly managed it can lead = to kidney disease or failure, blindness, heart disease, amputations, among = other complications. =20 I wanted you all to know that I have volunteered to help Mike in his effort= s with the JDRF walk again this year.  I am serving on the steering committ= ee and I plan to walk again this year to raise funds to help find a cure fo= r this terrible disease.  I am doing this to support Mike, but I also have = a personal interest in doing whatever I can to help find a cure.  My husban= d has adult-onset diabetes and we lost his mom and her three sisters all to=  diabetes and diabetes-related diseases several years ago.  In addition, I = have an uncle and a cousin that both have juvenile diabetes. =20 I am sending this message to ask you to join our team for the JDRF walk thi= s year.  It would mean a lot to me (and to Mike) to have support from the p= eople in our Enron Global Markets organization, as well as people from prev= ious groups we have worked with, along with other friends throughout Enron. =20 Some of you receiving this message have already signed up and I want to tak= e this opportunity to say thank you very much!  For those of you that have = not yet signed up, please consider one of the following three opportunities=  that are available to give your support to this important effort: 1.      Team Leader.  The team leaders help solicit walkers and handle the = collecting and reporting of funds raised by their group of walkers.

If you want to sign up to walk and raise funds for JDRF, = I will make sure that you get on one of our teams -- just sign up!  The JDR= F walk is a very fun event with music, entertainment and great food.  All w= alkers are asked to raise at least $25 in donations and will receive a grea= t T-shirt to wear the day of the walk.=20 3.      Supporters.

Since you were so nice and very helpful, I    am    wondering if you could assist me once again in landing a job at ENRON.     I ended up accepting an offer from Chase and started working right after    the    graduation. Unfortunately, the job does not provide much challenge to me    any    longer. Also, I am really missing the energy field, the team environment    and    all that. Most importantly, I would like to apply the knowledge I    acquired    at Rice and continue learning new skills. Banking turned out to be not    quite    what I expected.     Anyhow, I went to the Enron job site again and found an interesting    position. Would you be able to help me out one more time to get in    contact    with the right people? I would really appreciate it.     Here is the description of this position (and my updated resume).

I am following the news and issues about Enron. This has not in anyway change my resolve in working for the company. I am sure the Chairman will stir the company into the right direction.  I mentioned to you that I was interviewed two weeks ago by Andy Lewis of the trading group. It was an excellent discussion focusing on similarities in the career path that I and Andy took. Andy reinforced what I read in the Trading Naural Gas book by Fletcher Sturm who happens to be his previous seatmate. More than anything else, it was a great conversation that lasted for one hour and fifteen minutes. He mentioned, however, that he initially found me overqualified. I assured him, nonetheless, that I am committed to the task at hand.  The following day, my uncle received a call from someone at Enron who was looking for a number to call me at the university. I surmised this was the second trader who will talk to me as Andy mentioned previously. I left two voice messages at Andy's home and office number. I have yet to receive the second call. I am very much interested in pursuing the application. I will write a separate e-mail to Todd Peikert of HR to check on the status of the program. Just wanted to let you know.

"   -----Original Message----- From: =09Lin, Martin =20 Sent:=09Wednesday, October 31, 2001 1:15 PM To:=09Shanbhogue, Vasant Cc:=09Kaminski, Vince J Subject:=09ERCOT TCR votes  Lance and I participated in the Wholesale Market Subcommittee (WMS) meeting=  at ERCOT yesterday.  WMS was meeting to vote on various aspects of the pro= posed TCR design.  I'm happy to report that most votes went our way and the=  vote we lost does not matter significantly to Enron.  The following is a brief summary of issues and the votes.  1.  Derating We oppose derating.  I presented a few PowerPoint slides to advocate our po= sition.  Amorng the proposals were: a)  issue 100% of the commercially significant constraint (CSC) limit with = non-deratable TCRs b)  issue 100% of the CSC limit, but with deratable TCRs c)  issue < 100% of the CSC limit with non-deratable TCRs d)  issue X% of the CSC limit as non-deratable and 100-X % as deratable. WMS selected option (a), where 60% of the total would be made available in = the annual auction and the remainder would be auctioned off monthly.  All T= CRs would be non-deratable.  2.  Closely Related Elements The CSC is a single line.  The proposition is to introduce closely related = elements (CREs) to create a flowgate equivalent for the CSC.  There were se= veral votes on how to develop the CREs, if allowed, and what to do about ce= rtain units that would complicate congestion management with CREs.  We were=  satisfied with the decision to allow CREs, have them determined in advance=  of the year (as is done with the CSCs), and to prohibit certain units from=  participating in the balancing energy market when they fall between the CS= C and a CRE.  3.  TCR Primary Auction single party quantity limit Should a single entity be allowed to acquire the entire lot of TCRs availab= le in an auction?  We think so.  If a party is willing to pay more than any= body else for the TCRs, that party should be allowed to have them.  Since T= CRs have no value beyond the realized congestion, there is always the alter= native to simply pay the congestion.  If all TCRs are held by one party who=  wishes to charge excessive prices for them, everybody would opt to pay con= gestion.  The only game potential is that a party with market power in bala= ncing energy can manipulate price spreads and gain from the TCR position.  = This is a result of TCRs being financial and can be done whether the party = with market power holds all TCRs or not.  Furthermore, there is no way to e= nforce limited ownership in the secondary market, so a party wishing to con= trol all TCRs can buy them in the secondary market or gain effective financ= ial control.  We lost to vote to allow for complete ownership, but this pro= vision has little effect on the market anyway.",vkaminski@aol.com,j.kaminski@enron.com,FW: ERCOT TCR votes,2001-11-02 10:55:13-08:00,sent

I used to e-mail Vince Kaminski about the advice on his article ""The Challenge of Pricing and Risk Managing Electricity Derivatives"" and he had mailed me the copy. I am now modelling the Queensland electricity spot price using Geometric Brownian Mean Reverting Jump Diffusion Model and have followed your paper ""Making the most of mean reversion"" to estimate the mean reversion speed. I use Queensland half-hourly price during 13 December, 1998-30 June 2001 giving about 44,000 price observations.  However, the result from Ordinary Least Squares was not as expected due to different sign for both slope & intercept. The coefficient and standard error are as followed: Intercept: -0.3931 (0.0076) Slope: 0.1171 (0.0022) R Square: 0.0585 Therefore I could not estimate the mean reversion rate as the estimated slope has the positive sign. I have also tried monthly data and the results are the same. It would be appreciated if you could advice me on this matter.

I understand that you must be pretty tied up at this time.  As for your visit, I will pick you up at the Atlanta airport.  I will meet you at the exit of the escalator.  Please remind me of you airline and flight number.  I'll have my cellphone with me (678-637-8303).  One of my colleagues and I will take you to dinner in the evening.  Your schedule on Thurs. is as follows.  I'll pick you up at the hotel around 9:30.  We will have an informal meeting with one of my students from 9:50 to 10:50.  She will present to you some ideas that we have been looking at on bandwidth trading.  We are expecting to get some comments and feedbacks from you.  Your seminar will be from 11am to 12noon.  Dr. Bob Kertz (our QCF program director) will take you to lunch after the talk.  After the lunch, I arrange you to meet with our students from 2pm to 3pm.  The time slot 3pm to 4pm is open.  We will arrange a cab to get you at around 4pm.  I look forward to your visit.

I feel strongly that I cannot support the valuations my group has produced so far for the LJM/Raptor related transactions without examination of all the related legal documents.  I feel that we did solid work based on verbal information,  but I cannot guarantee the quality of the final product without looking at the contracts. These transactions are too complex and controversial to bypass due diligence requirements  that you would expect from any professional.

They need volunteers from industry. They need a response today if someone wants to participate in the first round of experiments. But anyone interested should just apply soon because there will be more. You get paid for it, too, depending upon your profitability. FYI Dennis Ray  ----- Dennis Ray, Ph.D. Executive Director Power Systems Engineering Research Center 608-265-3808    This is an invitation to participate in a set of electric power market experiments pertaining to the design and efficiency of markets for electric power using a unique internet platform called PowerWeb.  We are interested in testing several important markets with subjects at disparate locations.  You are being asked to either participate yourself or to pass this invitation on to the appropriate person in your organization.  We are interested in testing individuals or institutions with experience in the power industry. Participants will compete in a series of four electricity market experiments. The commitment required will be to review approximately two hours of training material and then to participate in two, two-hour sessions during times chosen from those specified in the attached registration form.  Those chosen to participate must be able to be simultaneously logged on to the internet and connected to a voice telephone line.  They must also use a Netscape web browser that we will provide if you don't have one.  Subjects must also be able to be paid for their participation.  You will earn approximately $350-$450 for participating in the experiments. Actual earnings are directly related to your performance. You will only be paid what you earn if you complete all four experiments.  In the experiments, you will play the role of an electricity generator and compete against 5 other generators (participants) to sell electricity in a market. In the market, the 6 generators submit offers to sell electricity and an auction mechanism determines the selling price(s) and what capacity is sold. No prior experience trading in electric power markets is required.  We will use the results of these experiments to help determine how player strategies and market characteristics change as the market rules change.  You will receive feedback at the end of the experiments about the results and what was learned..  To participate, completely fill out the registration form attached to this email and send it to Christian Vossler at cav22@cornell.edu. On the form, it is very important that you indicate times when you will be available to participate in the experiments. Direct any questions or concerns you may have to Christian. Once selected for the experiments, you will receive a CD that includes the Netscape browser, a user manual for PowerWeb  our experimental platform, and training materials.  Thank you for considering this invitation.

The only potential expense would be to cover travel expenses for the team if you want them to make their presentation in person to management in Houston.  The main commitment we need is a person who will define a project topic for the team and be available for periodic conference calls throughout the semester.  The project sponsor should help guide the team in their research, and provide any internal company data or other contacts within the company who may have information relevant to the topic.  If you feel that a non-disclosure agreement is necessary due the nature of the project topic, you may request that the students sign one.  Dr. Ronn is the faculty advisor for each team, so students use him as a point of reference as well.   Some potential benefits of sponsoring a practicum include:  Additional exposure to MBA students interested in pursuing careers in energy.  The project sponsor will get a close look at a handful of students in action (mostly 1st year MBA's), and can identify potential target recruits for internships or full-time hires later on.  ""Free"" research.  Depending on how you structure the project, the students' results and presentation should be useful to your organization.  For example, I did a practicum with El Paso last year, and we studied their use of Master Limited Partnerships as a vehicle for their midstream business.  We were able to research in depth some questions they wanted to answer but didn't have the time to do themselves.  Our research confirmed some of their ""hunches"", and management was very pleased with the results.  The level of interest in practicums among 1st year students is quite high compared to last year (over 40 students responded so far).  So, we would be excited to have Enron as a sponsor this year. (If you would like to sponsor more than 1 team, we would certainly welcome that as well!)   I have attached the original practicum document with some more details in case you do not have a copy.  Let me know if you have any other questions I can answer.

Maybe that's a coincidence, but I'm starting to doubt it.  My Patriotic Duty -----------------  I've been wondering about the best way to offer my patriotic services in this time of global conflict. I don't think I'd be a good candidate for Special Ops. I'd be the one with the wheeled carry-on bag saying, ""Hey, guys, I have sand in my shoe! Is anyone else hungry? Can I use my flashlight now?""  I'm already donating money to patriotic causes, and I bought some plastic flags made in China, but I felt I needed to do more. Then it hit me. There is one patriotic duty for which I have prepared my entire life: dehumanizing the enemy. In a sense, that's been my full-time job for years. I just need to replace the word ""management"" with ""Taliban."" So let's get started.  I've been trying to figure out the Taliban's long-term strategy and I think I got it: They're trying to reverse evolution. Their uncontrolled body hair is a good start. Living in caves was an obvious step too.  The hard part was eliminating any trace of intelligence in the children. But they've made great strides in that area. Have you seen the video of the Taliban schools where the little kids squat on the floor and rock back and forth chanting all day? No math, no social studies, just rocking and chanting. For PE they use sticks to whack stuffed dummies labeled ""Bush"" and ""Blair."" I'm not sure how they know how to spell ""Bush"" and ""Blair."" On any given morning they're probably whacking dummies labeled ""Tqwft"" and ""Upxpgt"" but it's a good aerobic workout either way.  Just for fun, ask yourself what part of the Taliban curriculum could NOT be accomplished by, for example, a monkey: Rocking back and forth? Chanting? Beating a dummy with a stick? Even if a monkey only got a ""D"" in chanting, he would still graduate with honors from a Taliban school thanks to his high overall grades in rocking and whacking.  As I write this, our generals are trying to figure out how to get the Taliban out of their caves. They're running sophisticated war game scenarios and calculating risks and gathering intelligence. I have one word for them:                         bananas  I don't want my patriotic words misconstrued as ethnic or religious insults. As soon as the evildoers stop doing evil, I am willing to promote them to full-fledged Induhviduals and insult them on equal footing with everyone else who doesn't read the Dilbert Newsletter.  Now that we've dehumanized the Taliban, let's get on to the important work of dehumanizing our bosses, cow-orkers and family members.   Induhvidual Confusion ---------------------  Some topics seem to confuse Induhviduals more than others. For example, they seem to have special trouble with concepts involving wildlife, vision and their own pants. See for yourself in these true quotes from Induhvidual bosses and Cow-orkers, submitted by DNRC members:  ---  A VP was speaking at a meeting and said, ""Well, you can lead a horse to water but you can't make him crap."" Someone up front said, ""That's drink...can't make him drink.""  To which the VP said, ""That's stupid.""  ---  ""In the kingdom of the blind, the one-eyed horse is king!""  ---  A cow-orker once said, ""Looks like he's thrown a wrench in the monkeyworks.""  ---  ""A two-prawn approach is necessary.""  ---  Here is a mangled expression the CIO at our company told me the other day. We were discussing an issue we both agreed upon and he said I was ""preaching to the blind.""  ---  ""He won't last, he's just a flash in the pants.""  ---  One of the employees called in to say that she couldn't come to work because she ""...had to have an autopsy.""  ---  My boss was telling a very involved story about something that happened to him. He leaned back nonchalantly and offered as a philosophical summary: ""Sometimes fact is stranger than truth.""  ---  ""It's a catch 20-20.""  ---  Our former boss suffered from the excessive use of mixed metaphors. An all-time howler was the day we asked him what his plans were to ensure success for a campaign and his reply was ""Don't worry; I've got an ace up my hole.""  ---  At a management meeting, my CEO said, ""Our company is like a living orgasm."" Now that's what I call job satisfaction.  ---  I overheard a manager congratulating an Induhvidual on having achieved a goal. The Induhvidual replied, ""It was nothing. You planted the seed, and I ran with it.""  --- In a meeting a cow-orker of mine referred to ""the carrot at the end of the tunnel.""  ---  ""We are going to be shooting from the seat of our pants on this one.""  ---  These all came from the same boss:  ""Vision is in the eyes of the beholder.""  ""Part of the verbiage is a language thing.""  ""Eventually, I want it now.""  ""It's not that kind of zero.""  ""There are a lot of areas for efficiency reductions.""  ""In the last year, you've turned around 150%.""  ---  When a high-powered agent of the company walked into the lunch room, our secretary remarked to our group that she couldn't stand him because he was ""so ego-testicle.""  One of my cow-orkers spit coffee out of his nose, which just added to the moment.  ---  ""I think you might have hit the nail on the button.""  ---  ""...caught between a rock and a wet spot.""  ---  And my nomination for scariest thing a boss ever said:  ""I was thinking about you in the shower this morning and I thought of a name for you.""

Holiday Gift Ideas ------------------  When I'm not slaving away writing FREE Dilbert Newsletters for you, I sometimes make holiday gift recommendations. I believe a gift should acknowledge the recipient's unique personality and interests. That's why I organized these suggestions by personality defect.   For Heathens, Vulcans, Skeptics and Dogmatics: ----------------------------------------------  My first non-Dilbert book, ""God's Debris"" (now in hardcover), is full of thought experiments about souls, free will and science that will have your friends and family arguing with each other for weeks. Combine the book with alcoholic beverages and there might even be some slapping.  The book is designed to fit in a stocking and to look as if you put more thought into the gift than you really did. Imagine how smart you'll seem when you say, ""I found all the errors in reasoning. I'm sure you will too.""  We probably didn't print enough copies of ""God's Debris"" for the holiday season (really) - it's way more popular than I expected -- so if it's meant to be a gift, act now. Get several for your smart friends or get just one and let people borrow it.  You can find ""God's Debris"" at:  http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0740721909/unitedmedia/107-5126509-7932516   People With Short Attention Spans: ----------------------------------  I recommend the Dilbert Page-A-Day Calendar for people who can't handle more than 10 seconds per day of any one type of entertainment. For more severe cases of attention deficit, consider the monthly wall calendar or the weekly planner.  Imagine the look on the face of the lucky recipient, full of unmitigated joy and boundless appreciation for your gift-giving brilliance.  You can find these calendars at the following links:  http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0740715674/ref=ase_unitedmedia/104-2285776-7245555  http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0740715712/ref=ase_unitedmedia/104-2285776-7245555  http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0740715690/ref=ase_unitedmedia/104-2285776-7245555   People Who Are Hard To Shop For: --------------------------------  I recommend my new book, ""When Did Ignorance Become a Point of View?"" It's a compilation of Dilbert comics that won't clash with anyone's home decorations or wardrobe. And it shows thoughtfulness because everyone you know has either had a job or knows someone who has.  Tip: When it's being unwrapped say, ""You'll like this unless you're dead inside."" That prevents most people from complaining, which is similar to being happy.  This book is available at:  http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0740718398/ref=ase_unitedmedia/104-2285776-7245555   For Dyslexics: --------------  For dyslexics (like me) I recommend the or Calendar Day-A-Page Dilbert, my book ""Debris God's,"" my and book, ""When Become Did a Point of Ignorance View.""  http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0740715674/ref=ase_unitedmedia/104-2285776-7245555  http://www.dilbert.com/comics/dilbert/shop/   People Who Stand Too Close: ---------------------------  Dilbert mints, featuring Manage-Mints, Improve-Mints, Accomplish-mints and Pay-mints are now available at:  http://www.candy2you.com/store/merchant.mv?Screen=CTGY&Store_Code=CS&Category_Code=D&Affiliate=Dilbert.  The mints are good for people who like tasty mints or bad puns or collecting little tin containers for who-knows-what purpose.   Plop, The Hairless Elbonian ---------------------------  Over the summer I was experimenting with a Dilbert spin-off comic strip about a little boy and his pig growing up in the clueless country of Elbonia. Unfortunately this isn't a good time to launch a comic featuring people who look like the Taliban. So it's on the shelf, probably permanently.  You can see the experimental strips at:  http://www.unitedmedia.com/comics/plop/  Let me know what you think.    True Tales of Induhviduals --------------------------  Here now, more true tales of Induhviduals, as submitted by members of the DNRC.  The story in your last newsletter about the kid named Ampersand reminded me of another version I heard recently.  One of my relatives met a woman who wanted to call her kid LATRINE.  It took me an hour to stop laughing long enough to ask if anybody had pointed out what a latrine is.  They had. She was apparently still intent on using it.  ---  When I received my new credit card, it had the number two (2) after my name instead of Roman numeral II as it should have, indicating that my name is the same as my father's.  I called the bank's customer service number and asked that their records be changed to use the Roman numeral two (II) instead of the number two (2).  The customer service rep said, ""I'm sorry, sir.  My computer doesn't have Roman numerals.""  ---  I just went to see the Cirque du Soleil.

This change has affected the way the larryoptmodel values the gas daily options.  The reason the larryoptmodel is affected is because the larryoptmodel was defining the inputs to the Ostrip model differently than the documentation asked.  Let me explain.  The Ostrip Model has the following date inputs:  NowToSet  - Fixed Price = zero   - Forward Start = days from now until strike is set  BegDays - Fixed Price = days from now until start of option   - Forward Start = days from when strike is set until start of option  EndDays - Fixed Price = days from now until end of option   - Forward Start = days from when strike is set until end of option  FwdStFlag - Fixed Price = 0   - Forward Start = 1  The Ostrip model should overlook the NowToSet days if the FwdStFlag = 0 (fixed price option).  It assumes the option is set right now.  The ""Old Ostrip Model"" did not overlook this input.  This is the problem.  In Larryoptmodel, the NowToSet is the same for Fixed Price options and Forward Start Options, the BegDays is the same and the EndDays is the same.  Thus when the ""Old Ostrip Model"" incorrectly used the NowToSet days, this made the Larryoptmodel value the option correctly.  When the ""New Ostrip Model"" was put into production, this model overlooks the NowToSet date, thus giving an incorrect value in Larryoptmodel.  Larryoptmodel has to be changed to reflect the above inputs.  It is actually only a change to one date.  This date will be used in calculating the three days above.  If the option is a fixed price option then the date will be today and NowToSet will be Today minus Today (zero), BegDays will be Start of Option minus today, EndDays will be End of Option minus today.  If the option is a forward start option, then the date will be when the strike is set and the NowToSet with be the strike setting date minus today, BegDays will be Start of Option minus the strike date, EndDays will be the End of Option minus strike date.  It is important to note that it is unexcusable to make any changes to the models without consulting the traders first.  If there was a problem with the ""Old Ostrip Model"" then the trader should have been notified right away.  This could have meant that the options were being misvalued when trading.  In this case, however, Larry had figured a way around this problem and he was valuing correctly.  When the model was changed, that changed the larryoptmodel valuation and now it was being valued incorrectly.  Either way, any problems with the models should be communicated with the traders right away.  Any changes to the models should be communicated to the traders before they are made.  Please let me know if any have any questions or concerns.  Thanks.  John     ",vkaminski@aol.com,j.kaminski@enron.com,FW: OStrip Function,2001-11-08 12:17:14-08:00,sent

He said that Lucent allocates about 3-4 researchers to work in this area. He said Lucent believes that the bandwidth demand will eventually pick up so they want to be the first one who provide products and research for supporting bandwidth trading. I agree with him that research work should not be stopped and bandwidth trading will become a reality in the next few years. This time the conference is very big.

Our conversation reinforced my desire to join Enron's Associate Program. I am positive that my strong analytical skills, specific knowledge of industry regulation and working experience overseas, particularly in the energy sector would be great assets to your organization.    As I mentioned to you during the conference, through my career and during my MBA studies at the Simon School (University of Rochester) and the London School of Economics (LSE), where I earned a MS in Industry Regulation, I have gained strong analytical skills and an excellent understanding of the global trends in the energy sector, especially of those related to the deregulation of the industry. Furthermore, working as an economist at the Vice-Ministry of the Treasury in Bolivia allowed me to gain hands-on experience in quantitative and financial analysis. These experiences have been complemented by my recent summer internship with British Petroleum (BP) Latin America where I was responsible for developing a valuation model to determine the acquisition price of a liquefied petroleum gas distributing company. As a result, I was directly exposed to the extraordinary prospects of the energy sector and to the expectations and needs of energy companies.    My current studies at the Simon School have also helped me further develop my finance and communication skills, which are essential for a position with Enron. I am confident I will be able to contribute positively to your organizations success. I would appreciate the opportunity to further discuss how my professional qualifications and personal qualities fit Enron present activities and its plans for the future. If you have any questions or would like to discuss any specific related to my credentials, please do not hesitate to contact me to the following telephone number: (716) 271 0934.

The merger with Dynegy, or a similar transaction with any other company, would trigger this provision on closing.  Assuming the merger with Dynegy is closed within 6-9 months, as we expect, this provision would entitle me to total payments of slightly more than $60 million.  Many CEOs have change of control provisions in their employment contracts and mine has been in place since 1989.  But given the current circumstances facing the company and our employees, I have been giving a lot of thought these last few days to what to do about this payment.  Initially, I thought I would use part of the funds for a foundation for our employees and take the remainder in stock and cash.  However, after talking to a number of employees this afternoon, I have decided that the best course of action would be for me to waive my right to any of this payment.  Therefore, at closing, I will receive no payments under this provision.  I know this action does not remedy the uncertainty that you and your families face.  But please know that I will continue to do everything in my power to serve the best interests of Enron's employees and shareholders.  I am still very proud of what we have built at Enron, and I want to continue working with all of you to correct the problems and restore Enron to its rightful place in the energy industry.

According to the graphs in the attached spreadsheet, the only significant drop in EOL trading came on 09/11 and 09/12. In fact, the largest number of transactions on EOL was on 10/23, which is since many of our problems started.

Although I do not yet have any new information for you, yesterday I submitted the following list of questions to the Q&A team, and will hopefully receive an update from them either tomorrow or Friday.   1) If the SEC files lawsuits upon conclusion of the investigation, will that hold up or stop the merger? 2) What are Whalley's responsibilities going to be after the deal is closed?  I know that he is going to be the EVP, but what does that entail? 3) Did we offer some sort of guarantee that we will maintain our current intellectual capital talent base? 4) Will back office functions start merging before the deal closes?  If so, when will this happen?  Chuck Watson made reference to this in the analyst call yesterday morning. 5) For employees who started working this year, will they still be granted options as part of the all employee stock option program? 6) Will all previously granted options vest upon deal closure?  Is there a provision in the plan that stipulates option vesting upon a change of control?  7) What is going to happen to the current Analysts and Associates?  Will we be reducing their headcount, decreasing recruiting efforts?1 8) What is the timeline for disposing of ""non-core"" businesses? 9) If you receive a reorganization severance package and opt to sign the waiver, are you precluded from joining the class action law suit? 10) What is going to happen to Enron's educational assistance program?  Currently some active employees are in school, and will we continue to pay for their education?  Also, there are some employees who are in school, but who have committed to return to Enron since we are paying for their education, or have stipulated that we will pay for their education upon return.  How is this program going to change?   Additionally, I have a meeting scheduled with Margaret Daffin tomorrow to discuss concerns regarding Visa's and Green card's.  I will send an email tomorrow with answers to the FAQ's.     If any of you have any questions, please do not hesitate to call me or just stop by my office.  It is such a privilege to be able to work with you and your extraordinary and fabulous team, and my door is open for each and every one of you.

"=20 -----Original Message----- From: Ken Lay - Office of the Chairman=20 Sent: Wednesday, November 14, 2001 9:29 PM To: DL-GA-all_enron_worldwide2 Subject: Overview of Investor Conference Call   Today, Enron hosted a conference call to give investors a current overview = of the company. Here's an update of what we discussed during the call.  We told investors that we're doing everything we can to protect their inter= ests and to regain their confidence. Our focus remains on our credit qualit= y, balance sheet and liquidity, which are essential for our continued succe= ss and expansion of our wholesale businesses.  It took more than a few weeks to get where we are today. Here's a snapshot = of significant events that led to our current situation:  -- In hindsight, we definitely made some very bad investments in our non-co= re businesses over the past several years. Those include investments in Azu= rix, India and Brazil. They have performed far worse that we could have eve= r imagined when we made these investments;  -- Because of these bad investments, we've become over-leveraged as a compa= ny. The negative impact of those investments was exacerbated through the ex= tensive use of debt capital both on and off our balance sheet;  -- We also entered into related party transactions that led to a loss of in= vestor confidence, which has been very damaging;  -- We've been criticized for our lack of transparency and our hard-to-under= stand financial and operating disclosures; and  -- On top of it all, we discovered errors in our financial statements, as d= iscussed in our 8-K filing last week, that required a restatement of previo= usly reported earnings.  We've taken a new look at our businesses and have separated them into three=  areas: core businesses, non-core businesses, and businesses under review.  Core Businesses  Our core businesses remain strong and consistent sources of significant ear= nings and cash flows for the company. They're our competitive advantage. Th= ese include:  -- Natural gas pipeline businesses;  -- Gas and power businesses in North America and Europe;  -- Retail businesses in North America and Europe; and  -- Coal businesses in North America and Europe.  The events of the past few weeks have had a temporary negative impact on ou= r projected fourth quarter profitability. It's too early to tell at this ti= me what impact this might have on our operating results. We are considering=  these actions now so that we can quickly return to normal business in 2002= .  I also remain optimistic that the actions we've taken over the past couple = of weeks have addressed our customer and counterparty credit and liquidity = concerns. According to our business unit leaders, we have definitely seen i= mprovement in our counterparty relationships.  Non-Core Businesses  Our non-core businesses include our global assets group and our broadband d= ivision. We have invested more than $8 billion in these businesses, and the=  return from them has been dismal.  We have an aggressive program in place to exit these businesses and expect = that the sale of these businesses will generate billions of dollars in cash=  that we can use to repay debt and reinvest in our core businesses. We alre= ady have more than $800 million in assets contracted for sale this year. Th= ey include CEG Rio, a gas LDC in Brazil; EcoElectrica, a power plant and LN= G receiving terminal in Puerto Rico; and asset sales of offshore oil and ga= s properties in India. The approximately $2.9 billion Portland General sale=  is also on target to close in late 2002 pending regulatory approvals.  Businesses Under Review  These businesses are comprised of those operations outside our power and ga= s wholesale businesses and include global and industrial markets. While sev= eral of these businesses have very strong future prospects, we need to dete= rmine if their capital requirements and near-term growth prospects are suff= icient enough in terms of earnings and cash generation.  Reviewing our businesses this way will help determine where we need to make=  reductions to our work force. More information will follow as soon as it b= ecomes available.  Credit Rating/10-Q Filing  We continue to meet regularly with credit rating agencies and believe that = our liquidity enhancements and scheduled asset sales will strengthen our ba= lance sheet and maintain our investment grade credit rating. Our current cr= edit ratings by the three major rating agencies are as follows:  -- Moody's at Baa3       ""Under Review for Further Downgrade""  -- Fitch at BBB-             ""Evolving Status""  -- S&P at BBB-              ""CreditWatch Negative""  We also discussed our existing financial vehicles, including Osprey, Marlin=  and Yosemite, in further detail. We told investors that we will file our 1= 0-Q five days late due to our current activities. It will be filed on Nov. = 19.  We will continue to have updates with investors over the coming weeks as we= ll as our frequent updates with you. The full transcript of our conference = call will be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission in the next = few days. It will also be posted on our web site at www.enron.com/corp/inve= stors under ""SEC Filings.""  =20  =20  In connection with the proposed transactions, Dynegy and Enron will file a = joint proxy statement/prospectus with the Securities and Exchange Commissio= n. Investors and security holders are urged to carefully read the joint pro= xy statement/prospectus regarding the proposed transactions when it becomes=  available, because it will contain important information. Investors and se= curity holders may obtain a free copy of the joint proxy statement/prospect= us (when it is available) and other documents containing information about = Dynegy and Enron, without charge, at the SEC's web site at www.sec.gov.

I'd like to leave San Francisco non-stop to Houston on United 1556 at 11:10 am Jan 9, arriving 4:44pm, then go to Austin on the late afternoon of the 10th (for a seminar at UT), then I need to get from Austin to San Francisco on the evening of the 11th. (There is a United flight 419 connecting through Denver that leaves Austin at 5:30 pm, connecting to United 409 out of Denver).

I am sorry for the delay, but we were waiting to receive more of the workshop evaluations so that we could provide you a more complete assessment of the workshop by the attendees.  As it is, we only collected 11 responses of the 17 attendees.  I will also send you a copy of this invoice in the mail and will be glad to send you the actual evaluation forms completed by the attendees if you would like to have them.  As mentioned in the attached, we enjoyed working with your group and hope that you can see the difference the training made in the presentation ability of the attendees.  If you have any questions about the attached invoice, please do not hesitate to call me at 713-348-5394.  Again, thanks for bringing us in to conduct the workshop.

To achieve   this goal, the BFS organizes every two years an International Congress.      The scientific program of the 2002 BFS Congress consists of plenary   talks and contributed papers. The invited plenary talks will give an   overview of the latest important developments in the field. They will   also present new ideas, directions and methodologies from Finance,   Economics, Econometrics and Mathematics and, discuss pressing problems   in the Finance and Insurance industries. The contributed papers will   complement the plenary talks with recent results and advances.       The overall scope is to create a unique interdisciplinary forum for   discussion of new concepts, incite stronger interaction across the   fields, and, at the same time, define new directions for the future   development of Mathematical Finance.

From our perspective, we achieved the key input and decisions desired of you.  We hope that you saw the meeting as worthwhile and that it met your needs as well. Any feedback that you have for me would be most appreciated.  I want to highlight the key outcomes and ask for your quick response on any concerns.  First, the name which received the greatest endorsement and therefore our choice was the Global Energy Management Institute, which as an accronym would shorten to GEMI.  As discussed, the full name would actually be the University of Houston's Global Energy Management Institute at the Bauer College of Business.  Obviously, most references would be the Global Energy Management Institute or GEMI.  Second, there was very valuable input and support on the concept of a ""partnership"" having four fee based levels ($100k, $50k, $25k, and $5k).  We will work at a first draft proposal of value received for those four levels and send to you next week.  As suggested, we will not have an entrance fee and we will think about some discounts or offsets with perhaps a minimum amount not offsetable. Another suggestion was to call the levels something which related to Energy.  We would offer up the Wood Level at $5k, the Coal Level at $25K,  the Oil&Gas Level at $50k, and Nuclear at $100k.  Look for your feedback here.  Attached is the outcome of the sub group selection.  We are thoroughly delighted that your participation is very balanced which should strenghten the overall results.  Hopefully next week we will be sending out separate e-mails to the three sub groups seeking your detailed input.  I mentioned that we would like to schedule the next meeting of the Energy Committee in January.  Please look at your calendars and let me know your availability for the following dates:  Jan 10, Jan 15, Jan 23 and Jan 24.  We will chose the one that the most members can attend.   As noted, the agenda for that meeting for our discussion will be the sub group results plus an important dialogue on Marketing (including alliances).  Again, thanks so much for your participation  Lane   - Sub Group Selection.doc ",vkaminski@aol.com,j.kaminski@enron.com,FW: Energy Committee Meeting,2001-11-26 12:44:15-08:00,sent

And remember to keep in touch!   ******************************************************************************************  Jake, the rancher, went one day to fix a distant fence. The wind was cold and gusty and the clouds rolled, gray and dense.  As he pounded the last staples in and gathered tools to go, The temperature had fallen and the snow began to blow.  When he finally reached his pickup, he felt a heavy heart, From the sound of that ignition, he knew it wouldn't start.  So Jake did what most of us would do, if we'd have been there. He humbly bowed his balding head and sent aloft a prayer.  As he turned the key for the last time, he softly cursed his luck. They found him three days later, frozen stiff in that old truck.  Now Jake had been around in life, and done his share of roamin'. But when he saw Heaven, he was shocked - it looked just like Wyomin'.  Of all the saints in Heaven, his favorite was St. Peter. [Now, this line, it ain't needed but it helps with rhyme and meter.]  So they set and talked a spell or two, or maybe it was three, Nobody was keeping' score--- in Heaven time is free.  ""I've always heard,"" Jake said to Pete, ""that God will answer prayer, But one time I asked for help, and, well He just plain wasn't there.  Does God answer prayers of some, and ignores the prayers of others? That don't seem exactly square - I know all men are brothers.  Or does he randomly reply, without good rhyme or reason? Maybe, it's the time of day, the weather or the season.  Now I just ain't trying to act smart, it's just the way I feel, And I was wonderin', could you tell me - what the heck's the deal?""  Peter listened very patiently and when Jake was done, There were smiles of recognition, and he said, ""So, you're the one!  That day your truck wouldn't start, and you sent your prayer a flyin', You gave us all a real bad time, with hundreds of us a tryin',  A thousand angels rushed to check the status of your file, But you know, Jake - - - we hadn't heard from you in quite a while.  And though all prayers are answered, and God ain't got no quota, He didn't recognize your voice... and started a truck in South Dakota.  So, remember to keep in touch!    *********************************************************************************************",vkaminski@aol.com,j.kaminski@enron.com,FW: Cowboy Prayer,2001-11-26 15:00:34-08:00,sent

Case in point: I am typing this newsletter using telekinesis while watching CNN in an adjoining room. And if I'm not mistaken, Paula Zahn is trying to flirt with me.   New DNRC Word -------------  A DNRC member suggests this new word for Osama's terrorist organization: Al-Qae-duh.  I would love to have been a fly in Osama's beard last year when he was discussing his plan for global conquest.  Osama: ""I have an idea. Let's attack the most powerful         nation in the history of the universe and then hide         in caves.""  Omar:  ""All in favor, say eye!""  That might sound like a crazy plan to many of you, but you need to realize that Osama grew up in Saudi Arabia where that sort of strategy has worked in the past. In the November 12th issue of Newsweek there's a ""Special Advertising Section"" where Saudi Arabia's public relations firm describes the wonderful history of Saudi Arabia. In 1901 a guy named Ibn Saud, along with his cousin and 38 buddies, climbed over the fortress wall in Riyadh and waited until the Amir came strolling by. Then Ibn and his cousin hacked the Amir to death with swords. At this point in the story -- so you don't think I'm making up this whole thing -- I quote from Saudi Arabia's own P.R. article: ""The Riyadh garrison, demoralized by the death of their leader, and fearing they faced a far larger force than 40 men, surrendered.""  That's right; Ibn conquered a whole city with 40 men, of which 38 were just standing around watching. Eventually the Saud family consolidated power, named the country after themselves and formed a royal dynasty that is still in power. That's the inspirational story that little Osama learned in school when he was growing up.  Who's crazy now?   True Quotes from Induhviduals -----------------------------  Here are more true quotes submitted by DNRC members. Most of these are from managers. As you will see, Induhviduals are confused by anything involving critters or body parts.  ""It's an exercise in fertility.""  ""Hindsight is 50-50.""  ""Just use your own excretion.""  ""You are never going to fail unless you try.""  ""We're scraping the bottom of the iceberg.""  ""Today is like the day Rome was built in.  We can't afford to have any fiddlers.""  ""The project is going down the toilet in flames.""  ""He might be barking at a red herring.""  ""You're treading on thin water.""  I think he meant we should cross our T's and dot our I's but it came out this way: ""Be sure we all cross our eyes.""  ""He's as deaf as a bat.""  ""We don't want to stick our necks out and get our asses chopped off.""  ""I gave him a real mouthful.""  ""I really took the bull by the hands.""  ""He doesn't know his hole from an ass in the ground.""  ""You should talk to her. She is a minefield of information.""  ""I can't remember but it's right on the tip of my head!""  ""You can lead a pig to pearls..."" and then he trailed off.  ""Thanksgiving is early this year because the first Thursday fell on a Monday.""  ""The skeleton is there. You just have to sharpen it and put the decorations on the tree.""  And this last quote, which may or may not have come from Osama: ""We need an escape goat.""   Plop Version 2.0 -----------------  In case you ever decide to start your own comic strip and you want to solicit opinions from other people, let me give you this piece of valuable advice. You should never -- and I mean NEVER -- give the comic a name that rhymes with any of the following words:  Flop Drop Stop  That little rhyming opportunity was not lost on about two hundred of you who thought Plop was not up to DNRC quality. Fortunately, some people actually liked Plop. I read every comment and the breakdown looks roughly like this:  Loved it:   33% Liked it:   46% (thought it has potential) Loathed it: 21%  That's a great response for a first draft of a comic. Comic strips normally get developed for several months before the public sees them. You're in on the ground floor.  Version 2.0 of Plop incorporates many of your comments. I renamed Plop (because Plop was the name of a comic book in the past), I changed Smokey's species, I made Plop more optimistic, I addressed the hip-deep mud question and I started to fill out the personalities of the main characters. Only a few people were bothered by the physical similarity to the Taliban, so I'm not going to let that bother me if the comic develops into something worthwhile.  The new and improved strips are posted on the Web at http://www.unitedmedia.com/comics/plop/ and begin with #21. All comments and rhyming insults are appreciated.   Induhvidual Baby Names ----------------------  Here is further proof that all Induhviduals should be given the same name to keep things simple.  --  A doctor friend of mine was on hand for a delivery in a maternity unit.  The mother named her daughter Placenta.  --  I once knew a person with the tuneful name of Listerine.  --  My wife was a public social worker in South Carolina many years ago. One of her case families had a daughter named Syphilis.  The family pronounced it in two parts: Syph-Philis.  One day my wife asked the mother how they came to name the child Syph Philis.  The mother said the hospital named her, and she got a copy of the birth certificate to prove it.  On the birth certificate was an annotation that the child was ""born of a mother with syphilis."" The mother assumed the hospital had named her child for her.  (Editor's note: That one sounds like an urban legend to me. Let me know if you've heard it before.)   Saving the World ----------------  Here's a fun mental exercise. Try to think of any problem in the world that wouldn't be reduced if we all did some extra shopping this year.  How about terrorism? Let's see, if we shop a little extra, that stimulates the economy, which increases tax collections, which pays for more security. Ta-dah!  How about unemployment? Shopping --> stimulated economy --> more hiring.  How about diseases? Shopping --> stimulated economy --> funding for research.  So I don't think I'm exaggerating when I say that buying Dilbert merchandise will solve every problem in the world. But don't think the burden falls entirely on you. I'll meet you halfway by listing some suggestions.  - Dilbert 2002 Day-To-Day Calendar. It's like having a book   that you can tear up one page per day.

Things Not To Say in a Restroom -------------------------------  I hope this doesn't spawn a new category, but these two reports were worth mentioning.  --  As I entered the restroom, a cow-orker who had just finished his business, turned to me and said, ""Oh, hey, Brent, I was just thinking about you.""  --  At my last job, just as I was entering a restroom, a cow-orker said, ""Say, can I grab you when you're done?""    True Tales of Induhviduals --------------------------  One of the young ladies in our office is getting ready for her ""dream"" vacation to Mount Rushmore. My colleague asked her to bring him back a picture of the other side of the mountain. When she asked why, he proceeded to convince her that on the other side of Mount Rushmore are the backs of the presidents, on their knees, with their heads stuck into the mountain. She is so excited that she is going to look for a special tour of the backside.  --  I went to a home improvement store to buy a new faucet for my kitchen sink. I did not see the particular model I had in mind, so I asked one of the Induhvidual employees for assistance.  He said, ""We stopped selling that model because it was the number one theft item in the store."" I waited to hear the punchline, until I realized he was serious.  I might have to find a new home improvement store if they ever achieve their goal of carrying no products worth stealing.  --  During a round of layoffs at the company, a farewell card for one unfortunate cow-orker was circulated. People were signing the card with ""good luck!"" and ""Been great working with you"" and so on. When the card got to the desk of one manager, he did not bother to read the card.  He just wrote ""Happy Birthday"" and signed his name.  --  A pool hall put up a sign in their front window that read: ""Profound language prohibited within."" I could just imagine some people discussing the meaning of life and being told to take it outside.  --  While traveling on business in Norfolk, Nebraska, I noticed a Ramada Inn sign:          ""Plan your next affair here""  The next day the sign was taken down.  --  At a business lunch, platters of calamari were passed down the tables. As a platter reached one of the employee's wives, she was heard to remark during an unfortunate lull in the conversation, ""No, thanks. I never eat anything with testicles attached.""  The stricken silence lasted a few moments. Then 150 people lost it.   --  I work in a camera store.  An Induhvidual came in and said his camera wasn't working and asked me if I could look at it.  I agreed and said I would check the battery first.  The Induhvidual said, ""I've had this battery for five years and I've never had any problems with it before.""  I changed the battery and the camera worked.   --  I would like to shove a live bear cub up my boss's nose and then have the mother bear go after him whenever he opens a phone conversation with, ""Hi buddy how's it going yeah me too!""  --  My boss was having a discussion with another employee about some work rules that pertain to people doing manual labor.  He said these rules don't apply to us because we don't use manuals.  --  Yesterday my boss called me and said, ""Effective immediately, I want you to stop your current activity and start working on this new area."" When I asked specifically what I was supposed to do, he replied: ""It was not my intention to give you a task today, just a mind-set!""   My Holiday Message ------------------  I've written and rewritten this section a dozen times. My problem is that no matter how much I write, I keep condensing it down to the same thought: This holiday season, as we laugh and eat and shop and enjoy friends and family, our soldiers are in Afghanistan risking everything for us. Some of them won't come back. The rest will never be the same.  Every one of them volunteered. They think we're worth it.  Let's prove them right.    Dilbert Fodder ---------------  What's bugging you about your job?  Let me know and you might see it in a Dilbert comic or newsletter.  The best comic fodder involves workplace peeves, devious strategies, frustrations of dealing with others, conflicting objectives, unintended management consequences, and of course my favorite - idiot bosses.

Ominous news from Pakistan and Iran indicate that at best a viral                 pandemic may be brewing among Afghan refugees, at worst that                 former Soviet biological weapons have possibly made their first                 appearance.                   In Pakistan, at least 75 people have been diagnosed in Quetta,                 capital of Baluchistan province, with Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic                 fever in the largest outbreak of the disease ever recorded. Eight                 have already died. All the infected are refugees recently arrived                 from Afghanistan or people living close to the border. An isolation                 ward surrounded by barbed wire has been established at the Fatima                 Jinnah chest and general hospital in Quetta.                   Ali-Safar Makaanali, head of Iran's Border Quarantines, has                 confirmed that Iranian health officials are also dealing with an                 outbreak of the virus, with more than 100 citizens having been                 infected. Iranian health authorities have established 40 quarantine                 bases on the border in an attempt to halt the spread of the disease.                 In addition, more than 100 mobile quarantine bases have been set                 up, and 39 hospitals have been prepared to cope with patients. As                 the traditional infection vector are ticks and as refugees would                 undoubtedly bring their livestock with them, the possibility of a                 pandemic looms large, especially if the current campaign causes a                 flood of refugees.                  The virus has a mortality rate of over 50 per cent, damaging                 arteries, veins and other blood vessels before leading to the                 collapse of major organs, eventually causing its victim to die of                 internal bleeding. The disease is highly infectious and can be                 transmitted via contact with infected individuals.                   Soviet biological arsenal at large                  What makes the viral outbreak menacing is the knowledge that in                 the 1980s the USSR's biological warfare research organisation                 Biopreparat intensively studied biological weapons and maintained                 a bank of 10,000 of the most dangerous and exotic viruses known,                 including smallpox, Ebola and Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever.                 Many intelligence analysts believe that Osama bin Laden acquired                 biological weapons agents from Kazakh arms dealers.                  Therefore, it begs the question: Are the Iranian and Pakistani                 outbreaks an unfortunate coincidence or something more sinister?",vkaminski@aol.com,j.kaminski@enron.com,FW:  this is an ugly report from Janes,2001-11-29 15:37:55-08:00,sent

Visit http://nww1.com/go/1203netsmart.html  _______________________________________________________________ Today's focus: E-mail intrusion detection  By Jason Meserve   E-mail. It's one of the greatest inventions of our time, despite the 40 junk mail messages I get each day. Still, there's one problem: The servers that deliver e-mail also can become hacker gateways into corporate networks.  Traditional firewalls block a fair amount of malicious traffic, but they allow e-mail traffic in through Port 25 (SMTP). Hackers know this and exploit it to gain access to the corporate goods. Compounding the problem is that many mail servers run on Windows NT, and as this newsletter has shown, unless an administrator is ultra-vigilant in applying patches, NT security can be as solid as Swiss cheese.  IronMail, a new product from Cipher Trust, is designed to help address this problem. It complements a traditional firewall while providing intrusion detection specifically for mail systems. The 1- or 2 rack-unit appliance scans all incoming mail for viruses, spam and other hacker threats such as buffer overflow and denial-of-service flood attacks. In the case of unusually long buffers, IronMail truncates the string before passing the message off to the mail server, preventing an overflow and crash on the server.  Also, IronMail can proxy HTTP, IMAP, SMTP and POP, as well as their secure equivalents. Administrators can set up mail policies on the server, such as adding a ""This e-mail is company confidential"" footer to all outgoing messages or requiring encryption for messages sent to certain domains.  IronMail operates on a Pentium-based appliance running an optimized version of the FreeBSD operating system. The 1U unit sells for $17,500 and the 2U unit for $27,500. Spam and antivirus filtering is sold separately on a per-user basis.  For more, go to: http://www.ciphertrust.com/ironmail/index.htm  Today's bug patches and security alert:  * More wu-ftpd patches available  As we mentioned in our last newsletter, Core Security Technologies has discovered a problem in the wu-ftpd server used by many Linux and Unix vendors. The vulnerability could be exploited by a remote user to execute arbitrary code with root privileges. For more, go to:  Debian: http://www.debian.org/security/ (The alert/patches should be posted shortly.)  Linux-Mandrake: http://nww1.com/go/linuxm.html  Caldera Open UNIX and UnixWare 7: http://nww1.com/go/caldera.html  Conectiva (this is an additional update): http://distro.conectiva.com.br/atualizacoes/?id=a&anuncio=000443  Immunix (another updated release): http://download.immunix.org/ImmunixOS/7.0/updates/IMNX-2001-70-036-02  CERT advisory: http://www.cert.org/advisories/CA-2001-33.html  * Linux-Mandrake patches postfix  A patch is now available for another vulnerability we reported last week: Postfix, a simple mail transfer agent, contains a flaw in the way it handles its log files. This could be exploited to cause a denial-of-service attack against the affected system. Linux-Mandrake users can download the appropriate patch from:  http://www.linux-mandrake.com/en/security/2001/MDKSA-2001-089.php3  * Red Hat updates gdb  Red Hat has released an updated version of the gdb package to fix a number of bugs reported in previous releases. The new version can be downloaded from: http://www.redhat.com/support/errata/RHBA-2001-159.html  * New OpenSSH packages from Red Hat  Red Hat has released updated OpenSSH packages. According to the company, these updates fix a bug in the packages' handling of restricted keys that could have allowed users to bypass command restrictions by using subsystems. They also fix a subtle bug that might have aided a passive analysis attack. http://www.redhat.com/support/errata/RHSA-2001-154.html  * Cyrus SASL patch available  The Cyrus SASL library is used by sendmail and contains a potential remote vulnerability that could be exploited by a malicious user to gain root access. Red Hat has patched the problem: http://www.redhat.com/support/errata/RHSA-2001-150.html  * SGI patches CDE flaws  We reported a while back that there were a number of root flaws in the CDE packages for Unix and Linux. The flaw could be exploited to run arbitrary code on the affected system. SGI has patched this vulnerability in its IRIX operating system. For more, go to: ftp://patches.sgi.com/support/free/security/advisories/20011107-01-P  * SGI will NOT patch Gauntlet firewall  Although flaws have been discovered in the Gauntlet Firewall for IRIX, the company will not be patching the product since it is longer supported. For more, go to: ftp://patches.sgi.com/support/free/security/advisories/20011104-01-I  * Patch available for IRIX NEdit  According to an alert from SGI, there is a vulnerability related to the way the NEdit editor creates temporary files. A problem with the software could make it possible to overwrite any file owned by a user of the editor. For available fixes, go to: ftp://patches.sgi.com/support/free/security/advisories/20011105-01-P  * Caldera patches OpenServer setcontext and sysi86 vulnerabilities  A ""family"" of security holes has been discovered in Caldera's OpenServer. The patch for the flaws could break the functionality of some authorized programs.

The assumptions are numerous to list here -- so I list below only the major ones. 1.  Underlyings in Natgas with a flat term structure -- $ 3.0 per MMBtu 2.  A reasonable volatility term structure has been assumed 3.  A representative set of 20 counterparties of various credit ratings selected on the basis of their MTM position on a random day this year. 4. The reported capital required is for a month and so is the VAR number 5. The volumetric exposure for each counterparty was assumed to be proportional to the MTM position on the same date as in item3. 6. We started with a premise of zero MTM, zero collateral at the starting time  and zero threshold for margin calls all through. 7. The volume is distributed evenly between financial and physical contracts and across 60 forward months 8. No distinction has been made between physical and financial contracts 9. The margin calls are assumed to be a function of the exposure times a factor which varies from 0 to 1 as credit rating goes from AAA to D  The results are therefore .... 1.  the unnormalized results illustrate the trend of capital required with the volume multiplier but the absolute magnitude of the capital required is tied to the simulated VAR and hence to the underlying volume level assumed.  If you have anymore questions please feel to call Karthik Rajan, Tanya Tamarchenko or myself.

Analysis   Rates  for property & casualty (P&C) insurance have hardened dramatically  since September 11, and terrorism coverage is likely to be excluded from  many policies from early next year. Is this the opportunity   that alternative risk transfer (ART) needs to take root in the market?  Or are potential clients still wary of applying capital markets techniques  to what have traditionally been seen as insurable risks?   iConference Our  next iConference, ""Selecting and Evaluating Credit Risk Models"",  takes place on December 11 at 1200 Eastern Time (1700 GMT). Craig Friedman  and Robert Cangemi of Standard & Poor's will present a strategic view  of the main issues for senior managers and offer the latest thinking on  some quantitative pitfalls. Sponsored by ICICIresearchcentre.org ,  this free, hour-long event is essential for anyone charged with selecting  a credit risk methodology. Click here   to register.  Feature As  Enron's experience testifies, killer risks can slip through even a sophisticated  enterprise risk management programme. As Alan McNee finds in our latest  feature ,  ""Who Watches The Watchmen?"", tightening the net involves looking  again at the roles of risk management and internal audit.  Still available: ""Risk  Management in the Digital Age"" , by Rick Davis of DigitalRisk Advisors  Bookstore Our featured book   this month is ""The Chastening: Inside The Crisis that Rocked the Global  Financial System and Humbled the IMF"" by Paul Blustein. Washington  Post writer Blustein looks at the inner workings of the regulators of  the international monetary system during the 1997-8 financial crisis in  the Far East that later spread around the world. And it isn't pretty reading.   Still available: November's featured book ,  ""Operational Risk - Measurement and Modelling"", by Jack L.King,  and October's featured book ,  ""Fooled by Randomness"", by Nassim Nicholas Taleb                    More than 17,000 risk professionals receive this email every week.

My doctors visit yesterday confirmed that the blockage has returned and some action is recommended to try and correct it.  The problem is that actions short of a by-pass leave a 40% chance of a second recurrence.  A significantly reduced work schedule seems an important part of any long term solution.   As a result, Ann and I plan to return to Michigan no later than February where I would take a few months to recover my health.  Part time work, at best, may then be an option for me.   As I expect you will have to eliminate many research positions, I would prefer to be included in the first wave.   I want to thank you for the opportunity to work in your group for the last year and a half.  I have enjoyed the work and the tremendous learning opportunity.

Cc: cgp1@cornell.edu Subject: Recent History   Gentlemen,  I woke up early as usual and wanted to help you, but the management had  other plans.....  In the emotion of the moment last Friday, I was too choked up to say much,  so let me try to make some amends this morning.  Of course, I hope to get  together with you guys some day soon, but until then I'd like to say a  couple of things.  The Weather Team was one of the best, most competent groups within Enron.   It compared nationally with ""major-league"" meteorology, both public and  private.  To break this team up is a serious offense to science.  I was  proud to be a part of it, learning and growing personally and  professionally.  I don't see how any job I find from here on out will compare to it.  The  Research Group in general was the finest collection of minds and talent I've  ever seen.  Vince chose them very carefully.  I just sort of wormed my way  in, but I was practicing hard while sitting on the bench waiting for my  chance to prove something.  And, perhaps more importantly, I have gained new friends. If there's  anything you guys need, let me know.  Mike, as the rest of you know, has an amazing talent for bringing out the  best in people.  As he told me Friday, I have indeed grown in the past two  years.  The credit for much of it goes to Mike, who lives the philosophy  that we called Enron.  Pity that some of the executives didn't.  I could ramble on for a while about this, but I won't bore you with it.  I  just wanted to say that y'all are the best!  I'd appreciate an occasional  e-mail if you hear some interesting company news.  Of course, I want to  immediately know what happens to each of you.  Kevin, you need to get that home e-mail going buddy!  I'll keep you posted on my job hunt if I turn up anything.  You'll hear from me again! :-)  Sam    _________________________________________________________________ Get your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer.msn.com/intl.asp",vkaminski@aol.com,j.kaminski@enron.com,FW: Recent History,2001-12-10 07:30:51-08:00,sent

As you know we are continuing to market our GPCM Natural Gas Market Forecasting System to the industry and have done pretty well in that effort.  In fact, we are doing well enough that our users are in need of good analysts who could quickly learn our system and operate it for their companies.  There are three or four openings in Houstonand several others in other cities in the U.S.  If you can think of anyone who has worked for you who would be both capable and interested in this kind of application, I would be happy to forward their names and information to the people who are looking.

Over the last several days, we in the research group have looked at ORACLE risk management databases and Enrononline data to corroborate the profitability numbers for power and gas trading.  Our analyses yield figures which are substantially at variance with what is normally believed to be the case.  Of course, there may well be information sources we are not privy to.  Moreover, we found some irregularities in the data which only serve to raise our doubts about the quality of the data.  As a result, we are not able to make an authoritative statement about the profitability of power and gas units. As we are not able to intepret the data ourselves, we have provided the spreadsheets so you can draw your own conclusions.  Thanks.

"Dear Dr. Kaminski:  Following this e-mail is a summary of the recent meeting of the Advisory Board of the Carnegie Mellon Master's program in Computational Finance. We would appreciate hearing your views on the subjects discussed.  Best wishes, Steve  -- Steven E. Shreve Department of Mathematical Sciences Carnegie Mellon University Pittsburgh, PA  15213-3890  shreve@cmu.edu http://www.math.cmu.edu/users/shreve Direct Telephone: 412-268-8484 Department Telephone: 412-268-2545 Fax: 412-268-6380 -------------------------------------------------------------------- Summary of MSCF Advisory Board Meeting December 12, 2001  Advisory Board Members in attendance:  Ashvin Chhabra First Vice President Director of Financial Strategies and Analytics Merrill Lynch  Joseph Langsam Managing Director Morgan Stanley  Art Mbanefo Managing Director Equity Derivatives and Convertible Trading Credit Suisse First Boston  James Vinci Partner Paloma Partners Management  David Waldman Senior Portfolio Manager and Director Fixed Income Quantitative Research Group Putnam Investments  Carnegie Mellon Faculty in attendance:  Richard Bryant Director M.S. program in Computational Finance  David Heath Hoch Professor of Mathematical Sciences  John Lehoczky Lord Professor of Statistics Dean, College of Humanities and Social Sciences  Steve Shreve Professor of Mathematical Sciences  The three new members of the board, Ashvin Chhabra, Art Mbanefo and David Waldman, were asked to present their perspective on future human resource needs of the industry.  David reported that Putnam relies on both fundamental and quantitative analysis.  In fixed income markets, he noted the shift from treasuries to mortgages and corporate bonds, and pointed out the accompanying rise in the importance of credit risk analysis.  Although Putnam has been a major employer of MSCF students, he noted that increased emphasis in our program on the asset management industry would be welcomed.  He pointed out the need for our students to understand how to translate theory into practice and to communicate to audiences of various backgrounds.  For David, applicants should be able to pass the ""airport test:""  if you are stuck with this guy for half a day in the airport, will it be a reasonably interesting experience.  Art also emphasized the key role of communication skills. He wants people who are very focussed and who can find practical solutions.  He welcomes applicants who have prior accomplishments which show they can be trained and have discipline.  He cited music and athletics as areas in which these traits can be demonstrated.  Ashvin proposed that students should prepare for the ""elevator test:"" if you happen to ride the elevator with a managing director, between the sixth floor and the lobby can you explain something to him in a way that he appreciates.  Ashvin believes that MSCF students, and quants in general, must either be able to work on the trading desk or have management skills if they are to survive in the long term.  He expects there to be growth in demand for people who understand technology and business.  He thinks personal finance services will also be an area of growth.  Echoing one of Ashvin's points, Joe would be interested in people with the skills to manage IT projects.  Two subjects raised by Rick are whether the MSCF program should specialize, say into energy or asset management, and whether there should be additional courses in subjects such as accounting and corporate finance.  The consensus was that the MSCF program should stay general, within the quantitative finance niche, and should remain highly quantitative rather than tipping toward an MBA.  There was discussion of the desirability of internships.  Joe pointed out that 80% of the Morgan Stanley hiring is from internships.  An internship doesn't have to be for a summer; eight weeks is possible.  Steve observed that we have not in the past had difficulty placing students even though our program does not include an internship and that an internship would lengthen the program beyond 12 months.  Joe said that a longer MSCF program with internships would permit different student cohorts to overlap so new students could learn from those who had interned.  Faculty would also be enriched by students who had interned.  ",j.kaminski@enron.com,shreve@matt.math.cmu.edu,MSCF Advisory Board,2001-12-18 16:50:17-08:00,received

I'm concerned that if it stays in its current place, readers  will be thrown off track and maybe even stop there.   The last two paragraphs of section III.A. are very hard to read (page  7).  Whether they are necessary is a question I have not yet  considered.   Their advisement against price caps (see section V.i. at pages 19-20) will  run counter against some of our wires members.   Their recommended alternatives (section VI, pages 20-23) are only loosely  tied to my work request.  I am uncomfortable with proposals related to  plant divestiture for large sellers (pages 21-22) and minimum interconnection  standards (page 22.)   On another front, a comment came in suggesting that the definition of  incremental cost should include accelerated (physical) depreciation.

"   -----Original Message----- From:  Athomas80@aol.com@ENRON   Sent: Wednesday, December 12, 2001 9:53 AM To: Kaminski, Vince J Subject: Research Group Teamwork  Vince, Over the past year and a half, I have been continually impressed with the richly diverse and highly collaborative working environment you created among members of the Research Group.  As you know, I pay attention to ""people"" issues in my work, and seldom have I observed such a successful and diverse team environment.    I believe that this experience is worth sharing with others and would like to write about it.  The purpose of the project would be to capture and share learnings related to the dynamics of the Research Group; larger Enron issues would not be included.  The writing would be based on interviews with you and perhaps ten others in the department.  Anything I write would be approved by those who are quoted, and the complete article would be reviewed and approved by you before being shared outside.  I do not expect to receive any financial support for the effort; I have some time now and enjoy doing the kind of effort I'm proposing.  I can show you a sample of similar, previously-published works I've done.   I realize that these days are already confusing and draining for you all.  On the other hand, this is a good time, perhaps the only time, to capture the wisdom that each of you has gained from this team experience.  If you have interest in my pursuing this idea, would you be available to talk with me further in the next couple of days? Respectfully,  Ann Thomas  (Bob Lee's wife)     ",vkaminski@aol.com,j.kaminski@enron.com,FW: Research Group Teamwork,2001-12-26 13:38:11-08:00,sent

This group is the smaller subset of the larger industry-wide plenary  group formed as a result of the FERC's directive to convene an Interconnection  conference to develop a consensus Interconnection Agreement and Procedures  document that all of industry would adopt.  As the industry plenary  session yielded as much results as could be expected in a large group setting,  the drafting committees were formed of Generators, Transmission Owners,  Transmission Dependent Utilities, and ISO/RTOs. A committee was formed for both  the drafting of the Interconnection Agreement and Procedures documents. Many of  your companies are represented on one of these committees.  Because the  FERC set a December 14 filing due date for a final consensus interconnection  document, we filed for an extension of time to complete the drafting process and  finalize the documents for FERC consideration. No one entity has endorsed the  document in its entirety, because drafting and negotiations are still underway.  Since the larger plenary had not had an opportunity to review the documents and  be provided a walk-through by the drafters, the request for an extension until  January 11, 2002 for which to file a final comprehensive consensus  Interconnection document was made. In addition, we filed for extension of the  ANOPR comments due date which was initially set for December 21, but has been  extended until January 25. This will allow for the larger plenary group to  reconvene the week of January 14 at FERC for a two-day session to discuss the  final workproduct.  A notice designating the dates and times of this plenary  session will be provided at a later date.  Anticipating our  filing of the status report and motion for extension, FERC granted both requests  for extensions to file. Attached are the status report, motions and notice  granting extension.

The  first of the four regional meetings will be held=  on January 15, 2002 in  Phoenix, AZ with the remaining meeting in Cincinna= ti, OH, New  York City, and Atlanta, GA .  An e-mail with all of the necess= ary  logistical information has been circulated.  If you are interested in =  attending or sending a company representative and did not receive the earl= ier  e-mail, please let us know.=20 In addition, FERC announced  a series of technical conferences on standard = market design and structure,  market based rate /market power, and energy i= nfrastructure.=20 =20 If you would like copies of any orders, please do not hesitate to  contact = us. Midwest ISO Receives FERC's  Approval as an RTO=20 In a series of inter-related RTO  decisions, FERC approved the nations firs= t RTO, granting the Midwest ISOs  proposal to become an RTO, while rejectin= g a similar plan from the Alliance  Companies to form the Alliance RTO. In = reversing prior policy, FERC concluded  that the ARTO proposal lacked suffi= cient scope and size to exist as a  stand-alone RTO and told the Alliance C= ompanies to explore how their business  plan can be accommodated within the=  [MISO] structure. Allowing two RTOs in the  Midwest would be a second-best=  solution that would compromise customers'  interests, FERC stated.=20 In related developments, FERC also approved  International Transmission Com= pany's request to transfer operational control of  its transmission facilit= ies to MISO and accepted an agreement between MISO and  International Trans= mission that would allow the company to be an independent  transmission com= pany that would share certain RTO functions with MISO. Finally,  in a relat= ed docket FERC granted in part National Grids request for a  declaratory or= der that it is not a market participant, but dismissed the  Alliance Compan= ies business plan without prejudice as unneeded given the other  Alliance o= rder, thus nullifying Grids proposal to manage ARTO. (More  detailed RTO su= mmary provided below)=20 FERC Delays Implementation of New Market Power Rules =20 FERC announced that it would delay the effects of its November 20 market  p= ower orders. In FERC's December 19 order, it recognized the Alliance of  En= ergy Suppliers' filing requesting FERC to vacate or stay the effects  of it= s market power orders and initiate a rulemaking proceeding to allow for  co= mments by affected industry participants, as basis for its change in policy=   action. We should claim this as a victory--for FERC has announced an upco= ming  technical conference to discuss said orders and allow industry to voi= ce its  concerns over the implications of such measures on the competitive = wholesale  markets. Although a date for this technical conference has not b= een announced,  Chairman Wood said that details of the conference will be r= eleased in a  notational order. FERC has also delayed implementation of cer= tain aspects of the  new Supply Margin Assessment (SMA) market power screen=  test. =20 FERC Sets Schedule for Electric Market Design;  Industry Told to Select Who= lesale Market Standards Body or FERC Will Do  So.=20 FERC outlined a schedule for a rulemaking in the  Electric Market Design do= cket and announced the release of a staff white paper  to serve as a strawm= an piece for continued collaboration with interested parties  on standardiz= ed electric market design. FERC stated it expected to host industry  worksh= ops in early 2002, tentatively set for January 22 -25 and February 4- 8,  t= o further develop ideas on market standardization and issue a NOPR in March=   2002. The NOPR would be followed by additional workshops in April and May=  to  discuss NOPR inclusions and workshop developments. Written comments on=  the NOPR  and workshop progress will also be due in May. A final rule is e= xpected to be  issued in July 2002. Although FERC staff recognized that thi= s was a very  ambitious schedule, the FERC presenter said they wanted to ""g= et done before  summer break"" (2002).=20 Meanwhile, FERC said, interested parties should  evaluate NAESB, NERC and a= lternative proposals for an organization to develop  wholesale electric ind= ustry business practice and communication standards, and  agree on a single=  consensus, industry-wide organization to develop these  standards by March=  15, 2002. The Order indicated that should industry not agree  on a single = organization by that date, FERC would either choose an organization  or ins= titute a proceeding to develop the necessary standards. =20 Commissioner Brownell reiterated her dismay and disbelief with  industry's = lag in progress: ""[l]et's get this done."".. "" I can't believe we're  still = debating the ""who"". The other three Commissioners indicated their general  = support for the Order. Commissioner Breathitt believes that this ANOPR proc= ess  is working well because it ""gives industry something to coalesce aroun= d.""  Breathitt was also in favor of industry answering the question of how = much  standardization do we need and how much do we need to leave to creati= vity and  innovation?  Chairman Wood concluded his remarks, saying, ""[t]he = GIGA-NOPR  is on its way.""=20 The staff white paper covering these issues is available  from the FERC web= site at: http://www.ferc.gov/electric/rto/mrkt-strct-comments/mrkt-strct-co= ncept.PDF   .=20 FERC Largely Reaffirms Prior Western  Market Price Mitigation Orders, Modif= ies Price Cap to Account for NW Winter  Peaking Concerns=20 In a broad rehearing order that addresses a  wide range of issues related t= o California and the western energy markets, FERC  generally denied reheari= ng requests and reaffirmed earlier decisions on pricing  and price mitigati= on measures. The order addresses rehearing and clarification  requests for = the Commission's August 23, November 1, December 8 and December 15,  2000 o= rders along with its March 9, June 19, and July 25, 2001 refund and price  = mitigation orders. Among adjustments made to previous orders, FERC modified=  the  scope of price mitigation and must-offer requirements, especially as = applied to  governmental sellers and cooperatives, eliminated the undersche= duling penalty  established in the December 15 Order, and provided an oppor= tunity for certain  entities to submit evidence that the refund methodology=  results in a revenue  shortfall. FERC also modified and provided clarifica= tions on setting of the  mitigated market-clearing price.=20 In particular, FERC clarified that: =20 government sellers and cooperatives are excluded from price mitigation as  = its applies to bilateral transactions outside the ISO spot market and also =  with the must-run requirement outside of California;=20 units operating outside of California may set the mitigated  market-clearin= g price;=20 the mitigated market-clearing price is to be set by the proxy price of the =  last unit dispatched, rather than the lower of the proxy price or the actu= al  bid of the marginal unit;=20 and generators subject to the must-offer requirement should be able to  rec= over their costs for complying with the ISO's instructions to keep their  u= nits at minimum load status, and that the ISO must pay these costs,  regard= less of whether the ISO buys the power.=20  Modification to Western-Wide Price Mitigation  Measures=20 In a separate order, FERC responded to industry  recommendation from its Oc= tober 29 technical conference and modified the price  mitigation methodolog= y for spot market transactions for the west-wide market for  the winter sea= son. FERC stated that changes would support continued price  stability and = balance in the western markets. The changes were called for in  part, FERC = said, since the area the California ISO serves is a summer peaking  system = and a large portion of the 11-state Western Systems Coordinating Council,  = consists of winter peaking systems. The changes extend from the date of the=   order through April 30, 2002, at which time the summer mitigation measure= s will  be reinstated. Most notably, the new cap levels take into account f= luctuation in  natural gas prices.=20 Modifications to previous mitigation measures  are; raises cap level from $98 to $108 continues to apply 10 percent credit worthiness adder sets February 2002 as date that final outstanding payments be made to  West= ern sellers of power  FERC's objective through these order was to allow  FERC and affected partie= s in the West to move forward on calculating  any refunds owed and to provi= de greater rate certainty and stability to the  market, according to the co= mmissioners.=20 More information on the  California and western market changes is available=  in FERC's press release:  http://www.ferc.gov/news/pressreleases/calif1-de= c192001.PDF   and the full order: http://www.ferc.gov/electric/bulkpower/el= 00-95-001-12-19-01.PDF   , both available in ""pdf"" format from FERC's websi= te. =20 RTO Developments =20 MISO Approved As Nations First RTO =20 In approving MISOs RTO application as the nations first RTO, FERC  said tha= t it complies with the vision and requirements of Order No. 2000, in  parti= cular the requirement that an RTO be of sufficient scope. FERC cited  favor= ably MISOs announced merger with the Southwest Power Pool and said that it =  was particularly encouraged by MISO's planned accommodation of flexible bu= siness  plans and innovation as well as its considerable geographic span.= =20 For the most part, FERC found that MISO satisfied the four characteristics =  for an RTO independence, scope and configuration, operational authority, a= nd  short-term reliability, as well as key functions. FERC did, however, di= rect MISO  to submit a number of revisions. FERC found MISO's independence = satisfactory in  most respects, but said that transmission owners cannot be=  permitted to have  veto privileges on filings that affect pricing. FERC co= nditioned MISO's RTO  status on modification of the MISO Agreement to give = it the authority to propose  rates, terms and conditions of transmission se= rvice under the MISO tariff. On  the scope and regional configuration chara= cteristic, FERC told MISO to present  recommendations within 60 days addres= sing the question of its eastern seam prior  to the integration of the Alli= ance Companies into MISO. FERC also indicated that  MISO should participate=  in its recently announced rulemaking proceeding to  standardize market des= ign rules. However, FERC said, MISO should also address  certain congestion=  management issues prior to implementation of standardized  market rules. F= ERC also directed additional changes to ensure the independence  of the mar= ket monitor and required modification of the planning framework to  reflect=  that it will consider all market perspectives and to accommodate  third-pa= rty investment, construction and ownership of transmission  facilities. =20 Alliance Companies Told to Work Under MISO; FERC Finds  IRCA Efforts Insuff= icient=20 Citing in part strong support from a majority of the Midwest state  regulat= ors for a single Midwest RTO and Alliance RTO (ARTO)s failure to achieve  t= he necessary close coordination with MISO, FERC concluded that the ARTO lac= ked  sufficient scope to exist as a stand-alone RTO. FERC expressed confide= nce,  however, that the Alliance Companies' desire to be a viable, for-prof= it  transmission business can be accommodated under the MISO Appendix I str= ucture.  FERC emphasized the importance of fostering RTO development design= ed to provide  a seamless and robust market for millions of customers. Allo= wing two RTOs in the  Midwest would be a second-best solution that would co= mpromise customers'  interests, concluded FERC. The Commission ordered the = Alliance Companies to file  a status report on their efforts to join MISO w= ithin 60 days. In the Order, FERC  acknowledged the significant time and ex= pense incurred by the Alliance Companies  to date, adding that it would con= sider proposals for recovery of all prudently  incurred costs.=20 =20 International Transmission Approved As ITC Under  MISO In a related order, FERC said that International Transmission Company  (Int= ernational Transmission), a subsidiary of DTE Energy, could join the new RT= O  as an independent transmission company that will be able to pursue innov= ative  business strategies. International Transmission proposes to maintain=  and develop  transmission while turning over to the RTO such functions as = congestion  management and curtailments, tariff administration, and securit= y coordination.  DTE Energy has indicated its intention to sell Internation= al Transmission to a  third party. FERC gave preliminarily approval for the=  divestiture of the  transmission facilities. FERC, however, deferred rulin= g on several contested  RTO/transco function issues until International Tra= nsmission becomes truly  independent. =20 National Grid Meets Independence Criterion, as FERC  Dismisses Alliance Com= panies ARTO Business Plan FERC granted in part and deferred in part a National Grid proposal to  mana= ge the RTO transmission system. FERC found that National Grid is not a  mar= ket participant by virtue of its retail obligations in New York and New  En= gland. FERC directed the Alliance Companies to explore how their business  = plan, including National Grid's proposal, could be accommodated within the = MISO  RTO. FERC expressed its intent to provide more guidance on this matte= r in future  proceedings. =20 General Discussion Signaling a deference to Midwestern state commissions, Chairman Wood said, =  ""[w]e have brought order out of an array of various and sundry efforts in = the  middle of the country. . . . Its a good Christmas gift to the nation. = Wood  cautioned that the orders findings are based on what best serves the = public  interest in the Midwest, and that FERCs actions should not be const= rued to  prejudge other types of RTOs in other parts of the country, includ= ing a  structure in which a for-profit transmission company could be an umb= rella RTO.  For her part, Commissioner Breathitt dissented on the Alliance = Order, stating  that after the Alliance Companies have already spent over $= 75 million in  start-up costs and its plans were given tentative approval b= y FERC over the past  two and a half years, she saw no reason to abruptly c= hange direction and deny  Alliance Companies an opportunity to implement th= eir business model. The  Commission has not done all it could or should do = to allow Alliance to develop,  Breathitt said.  Addressing the near-unanimo= us support among Midwest  regulators for a single Midwest RTO, Commissioner=  Massey stated, we are heeding  that advice and moving forward accordingly.=  For his part, the Alliance Order did  not represent a change of position, = he said, noting that he has long favored  forcing a consolidation of the tw= o RTO proposals. Additional details on these  orders can be found in the FE= RC press release which is available from FERCs  website at: http://www.ferc= .gov/news/pressreleases/mwestxpressrel.PDF   .=20 =20 PJM - PJM West Denied on a Procedural  Basis=20 Chairman Wood, in meeting discussion stated that the  rejection was on a pr= ocedural issue only, with a delay required only because of  provisions pend= ing in other dockets. In a two-page letter order, FERC rejected  the reques= t of PJM and PJM West to integrate, but Chairman Wood assured the  parties = that FERC remained committed to the expansion effort and wants to see it  m= ove forward very quickly. All indications are that once the other provision= s  have been addressed, FERC would be ready to move forward on the PJM West=  effort. =20 FERC Directs PJM To amend Tariffs to Include New  Oversight Measures=20 FERC terminated its investigation into allegations that PECO Energy Company=   had operated its transmission system in a manner that illegally advantage= d a  corporate affiliate. FERC staff indicated that the record in the proce= eding did  not establish a violation of the Federal Power Act or FERC's Sta= ndards of  Conduct sufficient to warrant further enforcement proceedings an= d that further  investigations into the matter were not warranted or necess= ary.

We would appreciate hearing your views on the subjects discussed.  Best wishes, Steve  -- Steven E. Shreve Department of Mathematical Sciences Carnegie Mellon University Pittsburgh, PA  15213-3890  shreve@cmu.edu http://www.math.cmu.edu/users/shreve Direct Telephone: 412-268-8484 Department Telephone: 412-268-2545 Fax: 412-268-6380 -------------------------------------------------------------------- Summary of MSCF Advisory Board Meeting December 12, 2001  Advisory Board Members in attendance:  Ashvin Chhabra First Vice President Director of Financial Strategies and Analytics Merrill Lynch  Joseph Langsam Managing Director Morgan Stanley  Art Mbanefo Managing Director Equity Derivatives and Convertible Trading Credit Suisse First Boston  James Vinci Partner Paloma Partners Management  David Waldman Senior Portfolio Manager and Director Fixed Income Quantitative Research Group Putnam Investments  Carnegie Mellon Faculty in attendance:  Richard Bryant Director M.S. program in Computational Finance  David Heath Hoch Professor of Mathematical Sciences  John Lehoczky Lord Professor of Statistics Dean, College of Humanities and Social Sciences  Steve Shreve Professor of Mathematical Sciences  The three new members of the board, Ashvin Chhabra, Art Mbanefo and David Waldman, were asked to present their perspective on future human resource needs of the industry.  David reported that Putnam relies on both fundamental and quantitative analysis.  In fixed income markets, he noted the shift from treasuries to mortgages and corporate bonds, and pointed out the accompanying rise in the importance of credit risk analysis.  Although Putnam has been a major employer of MSCF students, he noted that increased emphasis in our program on the asset management industry would be welcomed.  He pointed out the need for our students to understand how to translate theory into practice and to communicate to audiences of various backgrounds.  For David, applicants should be able to pass the ""airport test:""  if you are stuck with this guy for half a day in the airport, will it be a reasonably interesting experience.  Art also emphasized the key role of communication skills. He wants people who are very focussed and who can find practical solutions.  He welcomes applicants who have prior accomplishments which show they can be trained and have discipline.  He cited music and athletics as areas in which these traits can be demonstrated.  Ashvin proposed that students should prepare for the ""elevator test:"" if you happen to ride the elevator with a managing director, between the sixth floor and the lobby can you explain something to him in a way that he appreciates.  Ashvin believes that MSCF students, and quants in general, must either be able to work on the trading desk or have management skills if they are to survive in the long term.  He expects there to be growth in demand for people who understand technology and business.  He thinks personal finance services will also be an area of growth.  Echoing one of Ashvin's points, Joe would be interested in people with the skills to manage IT projects.  Two subjects raised by Rick are whether the MSCF program should specialize, say into energy or asset management, and whether there should be additional courses in subjects such as accounting and corporate finance.  The consensus was that the MSCF program should stay general, within the quantitative finance niche, and should remain highly quantitative rather than tipping toward an MBA.  There was discussion of the desirability of internships.  Joe pointed out that 80% of the Morgan Stanley hiring is from internships.  An internship doesn't have to be for a summer; eight weeks is possible.  Steve observed that we have not in the past had difficulty placing students even though our program does not include an internship and that an internship would lengthen the program beyond 12 months.  Joe said that a longer MSCF program with internships would permit different student cohorts to overlap so new students could learn from those who had interned.  Faculty would also be enriched by students who had interned.  ",vkaminski@aol.com,j.kaminski@enron.com,FW: MSCF Advisory Board,2001-12-28 13:12:32-08:00,sent

Probably should charge for non members for these events but needs to be reasonable.  Small training sessions could be an opportunity.

Over the last several days, we in the research group have looked at ORACLE risk management databases and Enrononline data to corroborate the profitability numbers for power and gas trading.  Our analyses yield figures which are substantially at variance with what is normally believed to be the case.  Of course, there may well be information sources we are not privy to.  Moreover, we found some irregularities in the data which only serve to raise our doubts about the quality of the data.  As a result, we are not able to make an authoritative statement about the profitability of power and gas units.

Brooks"" <rebrooks@earthlink.net>@ENRON   Sent: Friday, December 14, 2001 1:45 PM To: Kaminski, Vince J Subject: Good Luck, Vince   Hi Vince, Just a note to say I hope that you and the other good people I have met over the past couple of years are able to overcome the difficulties you are currently facing at Enron.  As you know we are continuing to market our GPCM Natural Gas Market Forecasting System to the industry and have done pretty well in that effort.  In fact, we are doing well enough that our users are in need of good analysts who could quickly learn our system and operate it for their companies.  There are three or four openings in Houstonand several others in other cities in the U.S.  If you can think of anyone who has worked for you who would be both capable and interested in this kind of application, I would be happy to forward their names and information to the people who are looking. Again, good luck in whatever you choose to do, please stay in touch, and thanks for your help.

I work for Aspen Technology Inc. www.aspentech.com We have not met, but a colleague of mine forwarded a copy of your presentation on Price Dynamics in the Energy Markets from the SIAM conference last April and am writing to you to encourage you to consider making a presentation at Aspen's corporate world conference Aspen World 2002 in October in Washington DC on this topic as well as the broader topic of Risk assessment and management in the energy markets. I know this seems a little strange making a ""cold-call"" in this manner, but I am reaching out in the community of Risk and Uncertainty management in the Supply Chain, Process and Energy markets to identify and solicit compelling speakers. AspenTech does not have a traditionally strong or well developed business or application layer in this realm, but, as our enterprise-wide reach and activities in planning, forecasting and supply chain have grown and integrated, I and the technology drivers in the company have been cultivating a demand and recognition for risk management and pricing activities to BE the next logical dimension to our growth and technology. Therefore, the session I am chairing (see the abstract below) will be one intended to educate, entice, and compel our clientele, business partners and staff on the business value, technology and mathematical and modeling technique. I would be happy to elaborate on the intended audience and opportunity for the conference. Please contact me at your earliest convenience by email or phone at the numbers below to discuss things if you think it would be a possibility or, if you would like more information on the context of the work and subject matter in AspenTech's core businesses.  Thanks in advance for your time.  Sincerely, Skip Paules  Uncertainty and Risk Management in Supply Chain and Process Modeling  This session will examine the assessment and quantification of uncertainties and risk in the supply chain and process modeling arena. The emphasis is on the modeling and enterprise business process aspects. Topics should include: point solution methods, such as design and real-time optimization application at the process level; planning and scheduling applications; as well as enterprise level solution strategies that balance forecasting, supply chain, planning, scheduling and operations. Commodities trading models, strategies and techniques are also included in this scope. What developments in the applications and theory of the field will allow us to take collections of deterministic modeling tools to the next strategic level where objectives for capital projects, operations, and supply chain optimization models incorporate not only economics, but also value-at-risk and/or robustness elements to create more broadly applicable or hedged strategies to achieve the desired goals.  Possible presentation topics will include:  * Uncertain supply, demand in planning and scheduling * Robust plant-wide optimization (real-time) * Robust control * Value-at-risk (VAR) quantification in modeling applications * Dynamic hedging in commodities trading (e.g. energy markets) * Flexible design and synthesis * Model sensitivies to uncertain parameters or demand * General algorithmic and modeling strategies for incorporating Risk, Sensitivity, and/or Uncertainty  _________________________________________ Granville (Skip) E.

" Vince,   I am an ex-Enron that was part of the ""cost cutting  measures"" implemented in early December.  One of the people I have spoken  during my job search is Mark Kierlanczyk from AON.  Mark suggested you  might be someone I could contact and talk to briefly about my job  search.   In general terms, I am looking for a job in finance  or structuring with an international company.  My ideal job would be one  that involved a mix of finance and origination for an international energy or  petroleum company, however I am very flexible.  Obviously, the market is  not real strong right now, especially in Houston, but I was hoping to ask  you if you have some ideas of how I might best proceed.   I am sure you are quite busy, but I would welcome a  moment to talk to when you have a couple of minutes.  (I have enclosed a  copy of my resume just to let you know where I have been...)

"   -----Original Message-----  From: Enron Office Of The Chairman  Sent: Fri 1/4/2002 4:46 PM  To: DL-GA-all_enron_worldwide2  Cc:  Subject: Northern Natural Gas    Yesterday, Enron settled a procedural dispute with Dynegy over Northern Natural Gas.  Our settlement allows Dynegy to exercise its option to acquire the pipeline, dismisses their Texas lawsuit and extends Enron's right to repurchase until June 30.  We reached this settlement as part of our efforts to bring Enron out of bankruptcy.  While we would like to keep Northern Natural, we still have some 9,000 miles of safe, profitable interstate pipelines as a base to rebuild our core businesses.    The settlement provides the best opportunity to resolve the pipeline issue quickly and pursue our $10 billion damage claim against Dynegy.  It also allows us to avoid the very substantial costs and distractions from protracted litigation in state courts.    We want to see a positive future for the employees working with Northern Natural Gas.  Below is a copy of a message from Stan Horton further explaining this decision to the employees of Enron Transportation Services.  Ken     Dear ETS Colleague:   On Thursday, Enron entered into a settlement over Dynegy's exercise of its option to acquire the Northern Natural Gas pipeline.  The settlement allows Dynegy to exercise the option and assume interim control of the pipeline while Enron pursues its damage claim against Dynegy.    In this respect, Enron Corp. has carefully weighed the substantial costs and turmoil that litigating this possession issue would create for the company and the employees of Northern Natural Gas.  Consequently, Enron Corp. has decided not to contest interim possession and allow the transfer of Northern Natural Gas to Dynegy, while the larger issues affecting its future are resolved.  The company has concluded that with this settlement, Enron should be able to resolve the issue more quickly, as well as avoid the legal cost burden and distractions to the business from protracted litigation in state court.  For the Northern Natural Gas employees, I believe this decision should allow them to steer clear of the dispute and focus on the day-to-day satisfaction of running a valuable, successful business.  Beginning immediately we will be working to achieve a smooth transition and to align the appropriate resources to assure continued safe, reliable and efficient operation of Northern Natural Gas.    Over many years we have run high quality, cost conscious and profitable businesses in ETS.  Keep up the good work!

He dialed the employee's home phone number and was greeted with a child's whispering, ""Hello?""  Feeling put out at the inconvenience of having to talk to a youngster the boss asked, ""Is your daddy home?""  ""Yes,"" whispered the small voice.  ""May I talk with him?"" the man asked.  To the surprise of the boss, the small voice whispered, ""No.""  Wanting to talk with an adult, the boss asked, ""Is your mommy there?""  ""Yes"", came the answer.  ""May I talk with her?""  Again the small voice whispered, ""No.""  Knowing that it was not likely that a young child would be left at home alone, the boss decided he would just leave a message with the person who should be there watching over the child.  ""Is there any one there besides you?"" the boss asked the child.  ""Yes,"" whispered the child, ""a policeman.""  Wondering what a cop would be doing at his employee's home, the boss asked ""May I speak with the policeman""?  ""No, he's busy,"" whispered the child.  ""Busy doing what?"" asked the boss.  ""Talking to daddy and mommy and the fireman."" came the whispered answer.  Growing concerned and even worried as he heard what sounded like a helicopter through the earpiece on the phone, the boss asked, ""What is that noise?""  ""A hello-copper,"" answered the whispering voice.  ""What is going on there?"" asked the boss, now alarmed.  In an awed whispering voice, the child answered, ""The search team just landed the hello-copper.""  Alarmed, concerned, and more than just a little frustrated, the boss asked,  ""What are they searching for?""  Still whispering, the young voice replied along with a muffled giggle: ""Me.""  ********************************************************************************  Never Ask Your Child a Question Too Many Times  Have you ever asked your child a question too many times?  Here is an account from one woman:  My three-year-old son had a lot of problems with potty training; and I was on him constantly. One day we stopped at Taco Bell for a quick lunch in between errands. It was very busy, with a full dining room.  While enjoying my taco, I smelled something funny, so of course I checked my seven-month-old daughter, who was clean. Then I realized that Matt had not asked to go potty in a while, so I asked and he said ""No"".  I kept thinking, ""Oh Lord, that child has had an accident and I don't have any clothes with me.  Then I said, ""Matt, are you sure you did not have an accident?""  ""No,"" he replied.  I just knew that he must have had, because the smell was getting worse.  So I asked one more time, ""Matt, did you have an accident?""  This time he jumped up, yanked down his pants, bent over and spread his cheeks and yelled: ""See, Mom, IT'S JUST BOTTOM BURPS!!'  While 100 people nearly choked to death on their tacos, he calmly pulled up his pants and sat down to eat his food as if nothing happened.  I, of course, was mortified  Some kind elderly people made me feel a lot better, when they came over and thanked me for the best laugh they'd ever had.  ******************************************************************************  And one particular four-year old prayed, ""And forgive us our trash baskets as we forgive those who put trash in our baskets.""  ******************************************************************************  A little boy was overheard praying:  ""Lord, if you can't make me a better boy, don't worry about it.  I'm having a real good time like I am.""  ******************************************************************************  Fun in Church  [From James Dobson]  One Sunday, a young boy was acting up during the morning worship hour.  The parents did their best to maintain some sense of order in the pew but were losing the battle.  Finally, the father swung the  little fellow up on his shoulder and walked sternly up the aisle on his way out to deliver some thoroughly deserved discipline.  As they exited the church auditorium, the little one lifted his head and called to the congregation, ""Y'all pray for me!""  *****************************************************************************  A Sunday school teacher asked her little children, as they were on the way to church service, ""And why is it necessary to be quiet in church?""  One bright little girl replied, ""Because people are sleeping.""  *****************************************************************************  The preacher moved briskly about the platform as he preached emphatically.  Because he was wired for sound with a lapel microphone, he jerked the mike cord as he went.  When he moved to one side, he got wound up in the cord and nearly tripped before jerking free.  After several circles and jerks, a little girl in the third pew leaned toward her mother and whispered, ""If he gets loose, will he hurt us?""  *****************************************************************************  Six-year old Angie and her four-year old brother Joel were sitting together in church.  Joel giggled, sang, and talked out loud.  Finally, his big sister had had enough. ""You're not supposed to talk out loud in church.""  ""Why?  Who's going to stop me?"" Joel asked.  Angie pointed to the back of the church and said, ""See those two men standing by the door?  They're hushers.""  ******************************************************************************  After the church service a little boy told the pastor, ""When I grow up, I'm going to give you some money.""  ""Well, thank you,"" the pastor replied.  ""But why?""  ""Because my daddy says you're one of the poorest preachers we've ever had.""  ********************************************************************************  A father was at the beach with his children when the four-year-old son ran up to him, grabbed his hand, and led him to the shore, where a seagull lay dead in the sand.  ""Daddy, what happened to him?"" the son asked.  ""He died and went to Heaven,"" the dad replied.  The boy thought a moment and then said, ""Did God throw him back down?""  **********************************************************************************",vkaminski@aol.com,j.kaminski@enron.com,FW: Why Parents Have Gray Hair,2002-01-07 09:32:49-08:00,sent

In the course of carrying out our assigned duties, we discovered a mouth watery sum of US$31.8m (Thirty one million, eight hundred thousand dollars), which is presently lying idle in a suspense account with our apex bank and not tied to any project. When we submitted our final report early this year, we deliberately refused to reflect this amount in our report because of our inordinate desire to make a fortune for ourselves by transfering  the entire sum to a foreign country so that we can benefit from it. This sum on application, is ready to be transferred into the account of any foreign partner of our choice who is willing and prepared to assist us. We cannot acheive this objective alone because as civil servants, we are barred from operating foreign account.  At the moment, we are interested in the importation of goods into our country with these funds which are presently trapped in this suspense account in Nigeria. In order to commence business, we solicit your assistance to enable us transfer into your account, the said trapped funds. The source of this fund has been traced to an over invoiced contract by the then military officers when they were in power but could not effect the transfer of this fund to their cronies account in Switzerland before they quit the political arena in 1999. Now that we are face with this rare opportunity, we have no option than to capitalize on it and lay claim to this funds together with a foreign partner. This is were you come in. Our desire is to transfer this sum into your account and fly down to meet with you much later so that we can collect our share. We Have agreed in principle to share the funds as follows: 30% will be for you for your assistance, 60% comes to us as the initiators of this noble dream and idea, while the balance 10% has been set aside to take care of unforeseen expenses while this transaction last. All modality for the smooth transfer of this fund has been worked out and it met all legal and administrative requirement in Nigeria as applicable to foreign contractors payment in the past.If you agree to assist us, within a period of two weeks or 10 working days, this fund would have been transferred and confirmed in your account.  Please indicate your willingness if you agreed to our Proposal by contacting the me on my email address or call me on my personal cell phone  for more information and clarification. If on the other hand you decline our offer, fine. We would still appreciate if you could inform us to enable us search for another personality to assist us.

"Vince,  I've ended up interviewing 20 people in the Research Group; everyone was very cooperative and insightful.  Now, I am in the process of synthesizing the information into coherence.  I think it'll be a great story, with even more substance and depth than I had initially envisioned. When we talked a few weeks ago, you offered to give me one or two names of people with whom I could talk with to get the perspective on the internal (and perhaps external) business value of the Research Group from someone outside of the Research Group.  I assume that would be someone within Enron.  Could you send me the name(s) and contact information for this?  The conversations would be relatively brief and either in person or by phone.

"Vince,  As you meet with employees one-on-one tomorrow, you will want to cover a few items with them.  These are some things we determined through reductions in other groups that work fairly well:  have Shirley or your team admin prepared to receive all returned equipment (laptops, cell phones, pagers, blackberrys, American Express cards, long distance calling cards, etc.) have someone call Cingular to confirm that Enron accounts can be converted to personal accounts.  I believe there is a form that the employee would need to submit to Cingular prior to the termination date. Shirley should coordinate with each employee to verify that all pre-petition expenses have been paid and that all post-petition expenses have been submitted for reimbursement. Because you have some lead time, you might consider instructing employees on how they should leave their desk.  It is very helpful if employees can destroy old documents, return supplies to a central location and leave the desk clean. In the past we have realized after an employee leaves that we may not have the right contact information when needing to get in touch with them.  Attached is a template to have your employees update their personal information to ensure that any corespondance is appropriately sent.    Khymberly and I will both be in your meeting tomorrow at 3pm.  Thanks, Shanna",j.kaminski@enron.com,shanna.funkhouser@enron.com,Process for Tomorrow,2002-01-09 14:44:47-08:00,received

At next week's meeting,  the Commission will address only 20 electric items, in comparison to its last  meeting in which it addressed over 70.  Although a very short agenda, FERC  has chosen to address some very long-standing contentious issues, e.g. FERC's  jurisdictional authority to order public power and governmental entities to  provide transmission service to FERC-jurisdictional entities, phantom congestion  in California, remaining issues of contention over the ISO NE's installed  capacity program, issues contributing to the inadequacy of generation and  transmission infrastructure in the Northeast, and tets of FERC's authority  to waive certain limitations of PURPA to re-certify a Qualifying Facility.      Commission Agenda: http://www.ferc.gov/public/isd/sunshine.htm  Infrastructure  Issues E-1 Infrastructure  Discussion in the Northeast AD-02-6 - Commission  discussion on topics to be addressed at FERC's upcoming January 31, 2002  conference in New York City on ""Energy Infrastructure Adequacy in the  Northeast"".      OATT Disputes E-12  Souhwest Power Pool, Inc.   ER99-4392-001 - Order on several requests for rehearing of the  Commission's 12/17/99 order which directed SPP to make several modifications to  its OATT. In addition, another set of filers seek guidance of how to  recover costs for generator and transmission maintenance costs resulting from  SPP rescheduling planned maintenance outages.    PURPA Challenges E-5  American Ref-Fuel Company of Delaware  Valley, L.P.  QF87-492-003 - Order on American Ref-Fuel's  request for re-certifcation of its qualifying waste-fired power production  facility . This proceeding has been protested by a group that calls itself,  the PURPA Reform Group. It contends that FERC does not have the authority to  change the Public Utility Regulatory Policy  Act ( PURPA) policies on  a case-by-case basis and,  in this case, grant the petitioner waiver of  PURPA 's 80 MW limitation.  FERC and the applicant did,  however,  receive congressional and industry support for this  petition.    Rehearing Requests E-20  Morgan Stanley Capital Group, Inc.   v.  California Independent System Operator  EL01-89-001 - Order on CA ISO's request for  rehearing of the Commission's Sept. 28, 2001 order, which established settlement  procedures to resolve complaints of the CA ISO's continued problems with  ""phantom congestion.""  E-19 ISO New England,  Inc.  EL00-62-037 - Order on several  requests for rehearing of FERC's September 28, 2001 order, which attempted to  resolve outstanding issues with implementation of the ISO-NE's  Installed Capacity program.   FERC Authority  E-11 Public Service Co.  of  Colorado TX98-2-000 - Order on Public Service's dated request that  FERC order Western Area Power Administration and several G&T cooperatives to  provide it transmission service, pursuant to Section 211 of the Federal Power  Act.   E-9 Pinnacle West Capital  Corporation TX02-1-000 - Order on Pinnacle West's request  that FERC order an Arizona Electrical District to provide it transmission  service, pursuant to Section 211 of the Federal Power Act.

Now, I am in the process of synthesizing the information into coherence.  I think it'll be a great story, with even more substance and depth than I had initially envisioned. When we talked a few weeks ago, you offered to give me one or two names of people with whom I could talk with to get the perspective on the internal (and perhaps external) business value of the Research Group from someone outside of the Research Group.  I assume that would be someone within Enron.  Could you send me the name(s) and contact information for this?  The conversations would be relatively brief and either in person or by phone.

" Shirley,  I shall be in the office tomorrow after 12. I am going to the UofH lecture at the Bauer Business School.  Please, take a look at this message. It outlines the process we have to follow.  Vince    -----Original Message----- From:  Funkhouser, Shanna   Sent: Wednesday, January 09, 2002 4:45 PM To: Kaminski, Vince J Subject: Process for Tomorrow  Vince,  As you meet with employees one-on-one tomorrow, you will want to cover a few items with them.  These are some things we determined through reductions in other groups that work fairly well:  have Shirley or your team admin prepared to receive all returned equipment (laptops, cell phones, pagers, blackberrys, American Express cards, long distance calling cards, etc.) have someone call Cingular to confirm that Enron accounts can be converted to personal accounts.  I believe there is a form that the employee would need to submit to Cingular prior to the termination date. Shirley should coordinate with each employee to verify that all pre-petition expenses have been paid and that all post-petition expenses have been submitted for reimbursement. Because you have some lead time, you might consider instructing employees on how they should leave their desk.  It is very helpful if employees can destroy old documents, return supplies to a central location and leave the desk clean. In the past we have realized after an employee leaves that we may not have the right contact information when needing to get in touch with them.  Attached is a template to have your employees update their personal information to ensure that any corespondance is appropriately sent.    Khymberly and I will both be in your meeting tomorrow at 3pm.  Thanks, Shanna",shirley.crenshaw@enron.com,j.kaminski@enron.com,FW: Process for Tomorrow,2002-01-09 15:53:46-08:00,sent

Now, I am in the process of synthesizing the information into coherence.  I think it'll be a great story, with even more substance and depth than I had initially envisioned. When we talked a few weeks ago, you offered to give me one or two names of people with whom I could talk with to get the perspective on the internal (and perhaps external) business value of the Research Group from someone outside of the Research Group.  I assume that would be someone within Enron.  Could you send me the name(s) and contact information for this?  The conversations would be relatively brief and either in person or by phone.

"email : charlesnujoma@37.com      ATTN    I m an accountant with the South Africa department of   minieral resources and Energy and I am also a member   of the South Africa contract award and monitoring   committee in the South Africa department of mineral   resources and Energy.  I am also on a special   diplomatic duty in the South Africa foreign office in   the foreign land.    Sometimes ago, a contract was awarded to a foreign   firm in Japan by my committee.  This contract was over   invoiced to the tune of US$25.5 million.  The over   invoicing was a deal by my committee to benefit from   the project.  We now desire to transfer this money,   which is presently in a suspense account of the   Central Bank of South Africa (CBSA) into any overseas   account where we expect you to provide for us.    For providing the account where we shall remit the   money, you will be entitled to 30% of the money, 68%   will be for myself and my partner, the remaining 2%   would be set aside to settle all expenses incurred by   both parties.    I would require the following:   1.Bank name and address   2.Telephone, fax number of bankers   3.Name of beneficiary / company name / address /   account.   4.Confidential telephone and fax number of   beneficiary.    The above information would be used to make formal   application as a matter or procedure for the release   of the money and onward transfer to the nominated   account you would provide.  It does not matter whether   or not your company does contract or project of this   nature describe here.  The assumption is that your   company won the major contract and sub contracted it   out to other companies.  We have strong reliable   connections and contract at the apex bank and the   Federal ministry of finance and we have no doubt that   will be release and transferred if we get a reliable   and trust worthy foreign partner to assist us in   mutual beneficiary deal.    Therefore, when the business is successful concluded,   we shall through our same connection withdraw all   documents used from the entire concerned government   ministry for 100% security.  We are civil servants and   we will not miss this opportunity.   Please contact me immediately through my above   telephone and fax number whether or not you are   interested in this deal.  If not, it will enable me   scout for another foreign partner to carry out this   deal.  But whereby, you are interested, send the   required information without delay, as time is of the   essence in this deal.     I await your swiftest response.

Electric infrastructure is vulnerable to disruption, however, until recently the idea of national infrastructure security was not meaningful to bottom-line focused executives in the power industry. The threat and scope of malicious and purposeful disruption today is much greater than that of natural disasters. Power companies will have to revise their day-to-day business procedures including risk management, operations, security and finance, as after all, there is no substitute for electricity.   This conference will give senior executives throughout the electric power industry the chance to educate and inform themselves on these topics of national importance.  A Faculty of international experts in the field of energy risk management and security will share their on-depth knowledge and experience with conference attendees.

The first was an antivirus vendor press release doing the annual look-back-at-last-year and look-forward-to-this-year pitch.  The Panda Software release says virus authors are getting more tricky in their attempts to spread viruses, using social engineering techniques to get unsuspecting users to open their malicious wares. Panda is hoping that 2002 will not be a repeat of 2001, when a number of simple ""bait"" messages caused mass mailing viruses to spread like wildfire.  Panda also suspects that viruses in 2002 will go after known system exploits like buffer overflows to run code on infected machines. Users are urged to keep systems and antivirus software up-to-date with the latest patches and updates. Sounds like common sense to me. For more, go to: http://www.pandasoftware.com/  The second item was an e-mail alert sent around by the authors of the SiliconValley.com newsletter warning that their systems had been hacked and used to send messages infected with Magistr.B virus. Not good when a major media outlet's systems are hacked and used to attack unsuspecting readers. Let's hope Network World's systems never suffer such a fate.   Today's bug patches and security alerts:   * More mutt updates available from Linux vendors  A buffer overflow in mutt's e-mail address parser could be exploited by a malicious user to overwrite arbitrary bytes in memory.

Check it out at http://nww1.com/go/ad216.html  ____________________________________________________________ Today's focus: Wireless LAN security, Part 2  By Neal Weinberg  In our review of wireless LAN security solutions, we tested 3Com's Access Point 6000, Avaya's Access Server 1, Cisco's Aironet 350 access point and Access Control Server, and Colubris' CN1000. Last time, we looked at the Cisco and Colubris products. This time, we check out 3Com's and Avaya's wares.  3Com's Access Point 6000 is a well-designed product. It features a two-position wireless access point with a flip antenna as well as a retractable X-Jack antenna on its wireless network interface card (NIC). The X-Jack lets you store the antenna in the NIC when not in use, keeping it in your laptop during transportation.  3Com's Dynamic Security Link technology is similar to Cisco's Lightweight Extensive Authentication Protocol (LEAP). One benefit of Dynamic Security Link is that it increases the number of simultaneous users from 65 to 255.  Furthermore, you don't have to manually enter the 128-bit keys. The software automatically generates new keys and distributes them to the client each session. This is great for encryption, but you still need to provide for authentication.  It took only 60 seconds to set up the access point, but implementing the full range of security took a while longer. 3Com's browser-based Configuration Management System was excellent, and the HTML-based documentation was complete and well organized. In all, 3Com's product had some neat technology.  Avaya's wireless NIC looked familiar and that's because it was. It seems that both Colubris and Avaya use NICs from Orinoco. But Avaya's solution goes far beyond just the NIC.  Avaya's Access Server 1 is a slick tool for managing corporate- level wireless security. It includes Remote Authentication Dial In User Server software that runs on any workstation plugged into the hard-wired LAN. And it employs automatic key generation and distribution.  Avaya's documentation was very good, with plenty of room set aside in the form of tables to record the system parameters administrators in large corporate environments should never commit to memory.  The Access Server manager provides the full range of management and diagnostic utilities you'd expect from a top-of-the-line corporate offering.

Now they have their sights  on three othe= rs. Herb Greenberg Mon Jan 21 00:00:00 EST 2002 If you learn nothing else from the Enron mess, take this lesson to  heart: = A company's inability to handle its debt can be its downfall--no  matter ho= w much Wall Street likes its stock. Indeed, while earnings may  be a window=  to a company's psyche, the balance sheet is what gives you a  truer pictur= e of its well-being. Bond analysts make a beeline to this  crucial piece of=  financial disclosure, paying special attention to a  company's ability to = service its debt. And when the ratio of cash to  debt plunges--watch out!= =20 The best balance-sheet snoops are often way ahead of the pack in finding  s= igns of trouble. Sometimes, however, the big credit-rating firms,  Standard=  & Poor's and Moody's, which get paid by the companies they  rate, are slow=  off the mark--slower, as a rule, than independent  bond-rating services li= ke Egan-Jones of Wynnewood, Pa., or research  firms like New York-based Gim= me Credit. ""We don't have the constraint of  trying to keep a company happy= ,"" says Egan-Jones President Sean Egan,  whose downgrade of Enron to junk b= eat the big guys by about a month. (To  be fair, Moody's is revising how it=  assesses companies, taking into  account additional information that could=  lead to a default. Standard &  Poor's, for its part, argues that its exist= ing methods are adequate.)=20 Given the scope--and the surprise--of the Enron failure, it's worth  asking= : Are there other companies out there that these aggressive  independent cr= edit-rating agencies are flagging now? You can bet on it.  We're not necess= arily talking future Enrons, but simply companies whose  financial situatio= n is more dire than the market thinks. Certainly one  where the alarm bells=  are ringing loudly (and which--don't remind  me--got a positive nod from t= his column a year ago) is Ford Motor. It's  no secret that Ford is having s= erious problems, but you wouldn't know it  from its credit rating, which is=  still investment grade. Egan-Jones,  however, labels it BBB-, a few notche= s lower than the other rating  agencies do and just one step above junk. Th= at's where Egan-Jones thinks  Ford will arrive within six months, as the sa= les boost from the much  heralded 0% financing starts to wane and bad auto = loans pile up. Junk  status raises the cost of borrowing and would be parti= cularly damaging  for Ford, whose ability to cover its debt has been deteri= orating  rapidly. Egan and other bond analysts measure this by calculating = a  company's interest coverage ratio--pretax income plus interest expense  = divided by interest expense.=20 The ratio, which varies widely by industry, is key to credit analysis.  Ega= n calculates that Ford's interest coverage has tumbled from 2.2 in  Septemb= er 2000 to just above 1 now. ""That's akin to saying that nearly  everything=  you earn will have to be used to pay your interest expense,  which doesn't=  leave a lot of money to invest in the business,"" he says.  Ford responds t= hat it's ""disappointed"" by the Egan-Jones rating; both  S?and Moody's insis= t they haven't been laggards and that their ratings  are appropriate.=20 Egan-Jones is even warier of computer maker Hewlett-Packard. Its credit  pi= cture is as imperiled as its proposed Compaq merger, according to  Egan-Jon= es--which has already tossed the tech giant's debt on the junk  heap with a=  rating of BB+, several notches below that of the major  rating agencies. ""= It's appropriate to view Hewlett-Packard on a  stand-alone basis, which is = not particularly attractive,"" Egan says.  ""Today it is hard to name any bus= iness where it's the undisputed  leader--even its printer business is being=  attacked."" Making matters  worse: From October 2000, Hewlett-Packard's int= erest coverage has sunk  steadily from 19 to just 6.6. (By contrast, IBM's = ratio, according to  Egan-Jones, is 11.7.) Hewlett-Packard officials couldn= 't be reached for  comment.=20 Finally, there's retailer Gap (another company this column once argued  you=  should never bet against, because of its miracle-working marketing  genius=  of a CEO, Mickey Drexler). While Gimme Credit's Carol Levenson  says Gap's=  balance-sheet condition is not yet critical, it's ""not nearly  as strong a= s it used to be."" Egan-Jones points out that Gap's interest  coverage ratio=  has plunged from 27.3 down to 8.8 over the past four  quarters. As a resul= t, the firm rates the retailer's debt one step above  junk and a couple of = notches below that of both Standard & Poor's and  Moody's ratings. Gap offi= cials say they have never ""worked"" with  Egan-Jones and point to the retail= er's standing with the major rating  agencies instead. The problem is, as E= nron proved, those agencies are  not always the first to sound the alarm.= =20  http://www.fortune.com/indexw.jhtml?channel=3Dartcol.jhtml&doc_id=3D205973= =20 Colleague at Fortunehttp://www.fortune.com",j.kaminski@enron.com,vkaminski@aol.com,Fwd: Caught Off Balance,2002-01-12 08:52:26-08:00,received

But for the past week, I've been  drawn back to reconnect - to check on friends and others I worked with to see  how they're (you're) doing.  I enjoyed the time we spent together  in the EGS, ECT, etc. days.  Vince,  I always respected  and admired the way you conducted yourself.  You were talented and hard  working.  You put together an outstanding team.  You  achieved, deservedly, much success in your time at Enron.  But you never  let it get to your head.  You were always friendly and gracious to  everyone.  The environment at Enron allowed and even sometimes encouraged  people to be otherwise, but you resisted.  You have Class.       Are you still part of the ""clean-up crew"" or have you moved on?  If  you're still there, thank you.   I hope this finds you well (given the shock of all things Enron).  You  most assuredly have a bright future.

In fact, the school's bottom-line-only philosophy has had a poisonous effect on American business practices. The Enron disaster is the most recent - and spectacular - manifestation.  To illustrate my point, let me take you back to a classroom at the school in the late winter of 1978. The course was productions and operation management, taught by Chip Bupp, a thoughtful and serious man.  On this particular day, the case study involved a company that manufactured a product that might be harmful, even fatal, to the consumer. The question was, what should you do, if you were the company's CEO, in such an ambiguous but potentially dangerous situation?  Several students offered suggestions, none of which galvanized the class. Then a hand shot up, and Bupp said, ""Jeff, what would you do?""  Jeff, with his thinning blond hair, wire-rim spectacles and slight Southern drawl, was one of the brightest members of the class and a natural leader. When he talked, as the commercial used to say, everyone listened.  ""I'd keep making and selling the product,"" Jeff said. ""My job as a businessman is to be a profit center and to maximize return to the shareholders. It's the government's job to step in if a product is dangerous."" Several heads nodded.  Neither Jeff nor those who agreed with him seemed to care about the potential effects of their cavalier attitude. What if the product really did harm consumers? How about the company's employees? Were they in danger during the manufacture of the product? What would happen to the company if the CEO's decision was wrong?  Few in the classroom that day dared to raise these questions. At Harvard Business School - and business schools nationwide - you're considered soft, a wuss, if you dwell on morality or scruples.  As the years went by, Jeff had a meteoric career. He became a partner in the McKinsey consulting firm. From there he joined Enron and was soon promoted to president and chief executive officer.  Jeff is Jeffrey Skilling, who resigned under unexplained circumstances in August after only six months on the job.  In two stock sales before and after his departure, he cashed out $30.6 million worth of Enron stock.  Skilling and other senior managers encouraged employees to buy and keep Enron stock, even when things started to sour, while they were hurriedly selling huge blocks of their own stock. And now Enron has collapsed, ""the largest bankruptcy case in American history,"" according to Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.).  One analyst told CNBC, ""It's the biggest insider trading scandal ever."" Another observer said, ""Enron was run to benefit the top executives. They literally looted the company.""  Yet Skilling proclaims total ignorance of any problems. ""I had no idea the company was in anything but excellent shape,"" he has said.  Articles about Skilling written since the demise of his company cite his arrogance and cold-heartedness. But as I witnessed sitting in that Harvard Business School classroom nearly 24 years ago, the seeds of his destruction grew out of a gross misunderstanding about the role of a business leader in our society. In his view, it is to be ""a profit center"" and to ""maximize return for the shareholder,"" no matter the peril to consumers or employees.  Harvard and other business schools must pay more than lip service to the gross ethical blind spots that the Enron case has exposed. Starting with an admissions policy that selects potential students for ethics and character as well as brains, these institutions need to return to the goal of teaching their students to be good citizens first and moneymakers second.  America can't afford many more Enrons - or Jeffrey Skilling-like CEOs.  LeBoutillier graduated from Harvard Business School in 1979. He is the author of ""Harvard Hates America.""

In its current form the analysis is quite simple. A stochasitic (fast or slow, with abritrary periods) is computed from the stocks data (see below for a more detailed description). Next, the stock data searched for Japanese Candlestick patterns (see below).  The actual analysis consists of simulating several years of trading (here ten years). Each is stochastic and candlestick data is examined. If the days candlestick is a hammer and the %k is above a pre-defined value, a buy signal is triggered. Likewise, if the days candlestick is a hanging man and the %k is below a second pre-defined value, a sell signal is triggered. When simulating a buy, a long position of a constant number of shares is opened if long positions already exist or if no positions exist. If there are open short positions, each of these is closed. Likewise, when simulating a sell, a short position of the same constant number of shares is opened if short positions already exist or if no positions exist. If there are open long positions, each of these is closed. When closing a position, the rate-of-return and annualize rate-of-return are calculated. For both long and short positions:                             sale cost - purchase cost                      RoR = -------------------------                                 purchase cost (a better method is needed for shorts)  and,                                                365                                       --------------------                                       Duration of Position           Annualized RoR = (RoR + 1.0)                     - 1.0  Stochastics:             (Todays Close - Lowest Low for kN Periods) %k = ---------------------------------------------------------      Highest High for kN Periods - Lowest Low for kN Periods) %p = Simple Moving Average of %k for pN Periods       (Where the lowest low is chosen from amongst the lows       field and the highest high is chosen from amongst the       high field.)  This is a fast-stochastic. When computing a slow stochastic, %k is replaced with its 3-day Simple Moving Average. %p is then calculated from this value.   Japanese Candlesticks: The application currently searches the data for the Hanging Man and Hammer patterns. A Hanging Man is defined as very short top-shadow, medium body, and long bottom-shadow. The ratios are adjustable. A Hammer is a Hanging Man where the days close is higher than the open.    -- Vince Kaminski vincek@cs.stanford.edu ",j.kaminski@enron.com,vkaminski@aol.com,Fwd: Doc Draft,2002-01-13 18:13:45-08:00,received

They know they do not put away enough, surveys show. But ask them to save more in their 401(k) plans and they balk. A buck in hand is irresistibly spent. Try a different approach. Ask them to commit now to increasing their savings in the future, make the increase coincide with the next raise, and they cheerfully sign up.  Various quirks embedded in human nature come into play. Saving more in the future seems much less of a sacrifice. When the future arrives, opting out succumbs to inertia. And timing the increase to coincide with a raise, so that one cancels out the other, is much more palatable than a cut in take-home pay. In the human psyche, giving up a raise not yet in hand is easier for people to accept emotionally than a loss, even the illusion of a loss. After all, the money ""lost"" is still there, in one's savings account.  Standard economics allows for none of these quirks. Over a lifetime, people rationally save an optimal amount, mainstream economics holds. Confronted with the reality that people do not save enough, the mainstream has no solution, except to reiterate that people are rational, so whatever they save must be enough. No wonder behavioral economics is making such a splash, becoming the ""in"" specialty of young economists from the best graduate schools.  ""You have to force savings and take the money away before people have it and can't resist spending it,"" said Richard H. Thaler, a University of Chicago economist.  Mr. Thaler is a pioneer in the development of behavioral economics over the last 25 years, and now he is a leader in finally applying the insights to daily life. So far the application focuses on persuading people to save more in 401(k) plans. But there are other potential uses. Fiscal policy is one. Allowing for human quirks, what is the most effective way to spend public money to promote jobs and economic growth? ""If we invested six months in designing a stimulus package using insights from behavioral economics, there is good reason to think it might work,"" Mr. Thaler said.  That is still off in the future. Medicine offers an immediate application. Some dentists, for example, are beginning to ask behavioral economists how to get patients to return every six months for teeth cleaning. Reminder postcards don't often work. People put them in a drawer and procrastinate - another human quirk that messes up mainstream theory, with its faith in rationally taking good care of teeth. Most people delay, unless the dentist extracts a commitment, by persuading a patient, when he or she comes in for a cleaning, to make an appointment on the spot for the next cleaning, six months hence.  ""The postcard system only facilitates procrastination,"" said David I. Laibson, a behavioral economist at Harvard, who gets calls from dentists.   THE most promising application so far is retirement savings. At a time when workers must save for their own retirement, they are in danger of inadequate income in old age unless they contribute 10 percent of their pay to 401(k) plans, pension experts say. And that does not count losses in 401(k) money invested in high-technology stocks or in the Enron Corporation (news/quote).  Such hearty contributions are certainly in the interest of the Vanguard Group, which administers 401(k) plans for companies like Philips Electronics (news/quote) North America, a unit of Royal Philips Electronics. Philips also has a stake: under federal law, top executives cannot have retirement savings too out of line with those of ordinary employees.  So Vanguard and Philips turned to Mr. Thaler and to Shlomo Benartzi, at the University of California at Los Angeles. Executives had read a paper they wrote, entitled ""Save More Tomorrow,"" reporting on the results at a Midwestern company where 162 employees, more than half the staff, had agreed in advance to annual increases in their 401(k) contributions, each increase coinciding with a raise. Over three years, the contributions rose to 11.6 percent of income from 3.5 percent.  Most of the 16,000 Philips employees enrolled in 401(k) plans save 6 percent or less. So Philips is experimenting. With Vanguard administering the test and Mr. Thaler and Mr. Benartzi giving advice, the company will ask 2,000 workers next month to commit to annual increases in 401(k) contributions of one, two or three percentage points. The first increase would be in April, when Philips gives annual raises, although this year, in a recession, a raise is not a sure thing, says Lisa Pyne, Philips's benefits director.  Still, she is counting on inertia to keep people from opting out - even the 3 percenters who, absent a raise, might notice the slight decline in take-home pay. ""Behavioral economics seems to work,"" Ms. Pyne said.   http://www.nytimes.com/2002/01/13/business/yourmoney/13VIEW.html?ex=1011981914&ei=1&en=192ceb9ad23813d2    HOW TO ADVERTISE --------------------------------- For information on advertising in e-mail newsletters or other creative advertising opportunities with The New York Times on the Web, please contact Alyson Racer at alyson@nytimes.com or visit our online media kit at http://www.nytimes.com/adinfo  For general information about NYTimes.com, write to help@nytimes.com.

The agency predicts a market worth more than $500 billion this year. S&P has reacted to the expected growth of such alternative investments by developing criteria for rating debt secured by the market value of hedge funds. And expects that rating these CDOs will encourage a wider investor base for the deals which, to date, have been dominated by niche investors.  Also this week, New York-based interdealer broker GFI launched what a market participant said was the first stage in its effort to create an online OTC electricity derivatives market in North America, via a soft launch in Alberta. Traders will be able to hedge electricity prices using electricity swaps and options, including base, peak and off-peak terms from day-ahead through the forward curve to calendar years via the new system. The broker has already combined voice and electronic brokerage trading in Europe - becoming the leading broker for German electricity. Should the Alberta project prove successful, it is likely that GFI will roll-out the hybrid model across North America, starting in the eastern seaboard area of the US.  In other energy news, Ohio-based utility American Electric Power (AEP) is set to enter the Nordic power market after its London-based European trading arm, AEP Energy Services, assumed operation of Enron's offices in Oslo and Stockholm. AEP gained an established team of 35 former employees of Enron Nordic Energy, which trades power and weather derivatives in Norway, Sweden, Finland, Denmark and Germany.  Meanwhile, the International Swaps and Derivatives Association (Isda) has hit back at calls for more derivatives regulation in the wake of Enron's demise. ""Advocating regulation for regulation's sake is bad policy and could severely affect the US's role in global financial activity,"" said Robert Pickel, Isda chief executive, in a letter to the Wall Street Journal. ""If OTC derivatives did not cause the bankruptcy and the bankruptcy does not pose a risk to the markets, the logical conclusion is that there is no argument for additional derivatives regulation. It is unclear... how additional regulation of Enron's derivatives trading operations would have prevented or mitigated Enron's financial difficulties,"" said Pickel in the letter.

Those attending the conference included many delegates, speakers, sponsors and exhibitors, as well as 16 people working for Risk Waters (UK, EU and US individuals). The initial trustees of the Appeal Fund will be Peter Field (chairman & chief executive, Risk Waters Group Ltd), Dennis Waters (chairman & chief executive officer, GenomeWeb LLC, and director, Risk Waters Group Ltd ) and Andrew Farley (solicitor, Boodle Hatfield, London). Risk Waters Group Ltd will be able to appoint new or additional trustees. The trustees of the Fund will have discretion over how and to what extent to benefit individual claimants and their decisions will be final. As long as the trustees act honestly and in good faith they will not be legally liable for the exercise of their discretion nor for any loss that may occur to the funds raised, howsoever caused. The Fund will not itself be a charity, but any surplus will be applied for such charitable purposes as the trustees think most appropriate to commemorate those who died.

Check it out at http://nww1.com/go/ad216.html  _______________________________________________________________ Today's focus: Red Hat no longer sings ""When I'm 64""  By Phil Hochmuth  Linux distributor Red Hat last week made two announcements that should make proponents of 64-bit Linux servers happy: it released Red Hat Linux 7.2 for both the Intel Itanium and Compaq Alpha processors.  Although Red Hat was previously able to run on Alpha and Itanium platforms, the software did not take full advantage of their 64-bit processing power. But version 7.2 for 64-bit computing includes the newest Linux kernel (2.4.9), with features such as higher symmetrical multiprocessing scaling and ext3 journaling file system.  The support for these features, Red Hat says, will allow the operating system to take better advantage of the Alpha and Itanium platforms, which can process much larger file sizes and handle larger address spacing than 32-bit systems.  Red Hat Linux 7.2 includes other enhancements such as improved USB support, network configuration and user management applications, plus a firewall configuration program that can be configured during server setup.  Itanium is the latest iteration of Intel's PC processor, and is catching on with users who run high-end Web servers and enterprise-level application. Prior to Itanium, the Alpha was the big dog among the 64-bit processor platforms. Although Compaq has said it will phase out its 64-bit Reduced Instruction Set Computing processor over the next few years, Alpha systems are still used widely in database and Web transactions servers in industries such as finance, medical, and supercomputing research.  _______________________________________________________________ To contact Phil Hochmuth:  Phil Hochmuth is a Senior Writer for Network World, and a former systems integrator.

This week:  * Initiation of coverage on Reliant Resources. * Chart in Section 2. shows US forward spark spreads remain weak.  1. Valuation Multiples Open this pdf to see a comprehensive schedule of valuation multiples for US utility, power trader, merchant generator, and power technology companies.   <<USUtils1.pdf>>  <<IPR Valuations Table Output.xls>>  We provide a summary of US consensus P/E ratios by electric utility strategy below:     2001E P/E 2002E P/E Distribution  12.7x  11.4x Integrated Utilities 13.0x  11.5x Electric Generators 10.6x  8.7x Energy Merchants 13.1x  11.6x Source: I/B/E/S, Schroder Salomon Smith Barney estimates   2.

Covered in the charts is the Western US region (COB, Palo Verde, Mid Columbia), the North East (Neepool), and Texas (ERCOT B).   <<US Power Prices 14 Jan 02.pdf>>   3. News Highlights   * PJM Study Says Single Northeast RTO Too Costly - Tuesday, 15 January  The PJM Interconnection has released a preliminary cost/benefit analysis suggesting the costs of joining a single Northeast RTO would outweigh the benefits. In particular, PJM believes it would lose over $690m of generator revenues, production costs and load payments a year. The reports suggests the ISO New England would lose $324m per annum, while ISO New York could save up to $2bn. PJM is expetced to pursue an agreement it has reached with the Midwest ISO to create a single market. As a result, the New England and New York ISOs are expected to pursue an RTO of their own. Source: Platts.  * UBS Wins Enron Trading - Friday, 11 January  UBS has emerged as the winning bidder for control of Enron's electronic commodity and derivatives trading operations, beating Citigroup and BP. The sale was limited to a 51% stake in a new company called Netco holding the hardward, software and employment conracts. The $13-billion contract book was not included. There is no cash invloved, instead the offer will give Enron one-thirs of any profits from a revived trading operation over the next five years. EnronOnline is expected to be up and running again within weeks. Source: Platts.  * Vermont Yankee Sale Under Threat - Friday, 11 January  The sale of the 540MW Vermont Yankee plant to Entergy ran into new problems as teh Vermont Department of Public Service recommended new conditions for the sale. In particular, the DPS would want the nuclear plant to continue to sell power to local utilities at negotiated prices after 2012 if its operating license is renewed. Under the existing sales terms Entergy would be free to sell on a merchant basis from 2012. A final decision is expected mid-2002. Source: Platts.   Vermont Yankee is part-owned (22.5%) by National Grid USA, the US business of National Grid (NGG.L, 1M, 459p). Until the plant is sold, National Grid USA will continue to share 80% of the revenues and costs with customers through CTCs. The remaining 20% accounts for under 1% of National Grid's total operating profit.  * Retail Choice Popular in Texas - Friday, 11 January  ERCOT has stated that it has received requests to switch over 34,000 retail electricity customers to new suppliers since it started accepting requests on 17 December 2001, ahead of full retail competition on 1 January 2002.  Source: Platts   Centrica (CNA.L, 2M, 233p) filed an application in September 2001 with the Public Utility Commission of Texas to be licensed as a retail electric provider (REP) in the state. It sought authority to begin marketing electric service to residential and small commercial customers, and it plans to provide service under the brand names of Republic Power and Energy America. Centrica has held preliminary discussions with potential wholesale power suppliers. Its primary focus will be on key metropolitan areas such as Dallas-Fort Worth, Houston and Corpus Christi.  * California AG Sues PG&E - Friday, 11 January  California Attorney General has filed a lawsuit seeking $600m-$4bn damages from PG&E Corp. for allegedly violating legal agreements designed to protect utility ratepayers. Source: Platts  * New York State Sues Niagara Mohawk/NRG - Thursday, 10 January  New York State has filed a lawsuit accusing Niagara Mohawk (NiMo) and NRG of violating the Clean Air Act. The lawsuit refers to two coal-fired plants that NiMo sold to NRG in 1998, Huntley and Dunkirk. It alleges that improvements were made to the plant  without upgrading air pollution controls. NRG and NiMo themselves are fighting over who has responsibility for the pollution controls, which could cost $350m. NiMo is suing NRG, saying the responsibility for the controls lies with NRG and was specified in the sales contract. NRG dispute this claim. Both lawsuits are pending. Source: Dow Jones   National Grid (NGG.L, 1M, 459p) are currently in the process of acquiring NiMo in a deal expected to close early this year. NiMo has exited from generation over the last few years and is a wires-focused business.  * Mirant Triples Cash Reserves - Thursday, 10 January  A recent credit rating downgrade to ""junk"" status by Moody's has forced Mirant to triple the amount of cash it uses to support its trading operations to upto $1bn. Mirant also said that its ability to do long-term structured deals has been affected. However, the company believes it is well positioned to benefit from the demise of Enron.

US Research We summarise below relevant research from SSB's US Utilities Team. The full reports can be found on SSSB's GEO (Global Equity Online) service.  RELIANT RESOURCES (3H, Current: $15.59, Target: $17.00) - We initiate coverage on Reliant Resources (RRI)  with a 3H (Neutral, High Risk) rating and a $17 price target. Reliant Resources is a diversified deregulated energy provider, with businesses including power generation, wholesale trading & marketing, and retail energy. In May of 2001, 20% of Reliant Resources was offered to the public by parent REI-- a full spin is expected during 1Q 2002. Our Neutral rating reflects (1) Reliant Resources' inconsistent track record in their Merchant business & (2) their significant leverage to commodity prices though their fast-growing generation portfolio. Our analysis continues to show depressed forward power prices & spark spreads across the U.S. in 2002/3. We used sum-of-the-parts and adjusted present value analyses to derive our $17 price target for RRI.   <<RRI.pdf>>  Peter Bisztyga Associate European Utilities Equity Research Schroder Salomon Smith Barney Tel: +44 20 7986 3932 Fax: +44 20 7986 4342 E-mail: peter.bisztyga@ssmb.com  Should you experience any problems opening this file, or if you wish to receive SSSB Utilities e-mails on a sector-only, UK-only, European-only, or named stock basis - or be removed from our list - please contact natalie.knapp@ssmb.com.

""The Demise of Enron"" is a bit risky, given that this drama is  still unfolding and the legal ramifications are still uncertain. Maybe you can  change the topic to ""Energy Markets: Is There Life after Enron?"" The person  who can cover this topic is either Richard Stavros or Mark Hand. They have  recently published articles in ""Public Utilities Fortnightly"" on this topic --  they are both editors working for this magazine. If you cannot locate these  articles, I can fax you the copies.  Vince    - Speaker details.doc ",j.kaminski@enron.com,vkaminski@aol.com,Fwd: EPRM 2002,2002-01-15 20:34:20-08:00,received

"Dear Vince,  Just to remind you, I will be graduating this May with an MBA from Rice.  My concentration is in finance, but I'm also an undergraduate engineer from Cornell University and an IT specialist.  I need help not simply finding a job, but perhaps some suggestions on how I can differentiate myself from my classmates in my job search.  I've been somewhat frustrated trying to explain why I'm more effective than my peers. Mike Roberts even said that I achieved more for the weather group in three months over the Summer than any other MBA achieved in a year.  This was probably due to my technical background and ability to put models into program code quickly and reliably.  I know this is a tough economy, but I just want a chance to do good work and show quick success.  What I can't say in my resume is that I'm the best in my class at finance, statistics, and information technology.  However, this combination is also my biggest crutch.  I'd like to engage all my skills, but typically, interviewers are only looking for one.  Do you have any leads to big or small companies that might be interested in my skill set?  I'm indifferent to moving anywhere in the U.S.  Vince, in any case, I appreciate your time and any suggestions you could offer.  I had a wonderful time working for you, we really had a good team. If you have any questions for me, please call or email me at any time.  Sincerely, Chris Pernoud  P.S. If your son ever wants to startup a linux company, I'd be interested in helping, he could email me at cgp1@cornell.edu.   =================== Chris and Kate Pernoud 4848 Pin Oak Park Apt. 1516 Houston, TX 77081 (713)349-8963 cgp1@cornell.edu   - ChrisPernoud.doc ",j.kaminski@enron.com,cgp1@cornell.edu,help finding finance work,2002-01-16 10:08:11-08:00,received

"Vince  Do we need a more specific letter addressing EXOTICA/Structuring Models than just a blanket reference to the Enron/UBS agreements? I have only briefly scanned the agreement, but it appears to obligate both parties to work toward a transition of all of the identifed software scheduled in the Licence Agreement. If this suffices, I'd assume you would need an executed copy of the final agreement before we formally start the transition. As before, I'm just making sure we are conforming to an approved process, if there is such one at this point.  Your thoughts?

"Hello Vince, hope you had a good holiday, dispite it all. I don't know if you received a copy of our end of year issue so I've attached it here. The risk section received some pretty good marks. I don't know what your plans are going foreward, but I would like to keep the communication open. I've been playing around with a few concepts for special sections in the Risk Desk -- tossed around the ideas to a few big fivers, CRO's and the like, guys like Pokalsky and so on. The publication is growing pretty steadily so I think some kind of relationship between the two of us might be good for all involved. Anyhow, would like to discuss the details sometime soon-- what's good for you? Best John At 02:28 PM 09/14/2001 -0500, you wrote: John, Sorry for a delay in responding to your message.

Congressional leaders weren't able to agree on the contents of an economic stimulus package by the end of 2001.  Renewed efforts toward a recovery plan have been introduced by both parties this month -- Senate Majority Leader Daschle proposes a plan in which businesses would receive a tax credit for creating new jobs or raising workers' salaries, and provide a depreciation bonus for equipment investments.  President Bush continues to support a plan that would accelerate marginal tax rate cuts enacted last June, provide favorable tax treatment for businesses investing in new equipment, and provide additional unemployment benefits.  One important bill did make it through, however: the Victims of Terrorism Tax Relief Act of 2001 was passed by Congress on December 21, 2001.  This bill extends relief to the survivors of victims of the September 11 attacks as well as to victims of anthrax attacks and the Oklahoma City attack.  Among other provisions, the bill waives income tax liability for all victims of these attacks for the year of death.

The rules covering rollovers can be confusing - certain rules must be followed to ensure that you're not taxed when you take money out of a retirement plan and put it into an IRA. Here's the general rule: you're not taxed when you move the money you have in a retirement account over to an IRA account or even from one IRA to another IRA - but as with nearly everything involving taxes, there are exceptions.  Learn more about the IRA rollover rules - and how they changed for 2002.

A:  No, you can't.  Your IRA is a ""tax-deferred"" account, meaning that all transactions, whether resulting in income or losses, aren't subject to taxes until you actually withdraw the money, presumably when you retire.  This is a very common question in times of economic downturn - the obvious upside of IRA accounts is that in an economic boom, your gains in your IRA aren't taxable either until withdrawal.  Q:  We have recently refinanced our home.  What are the tax implications and can we deduct the points associated with the refinancing? A:  With most refinancings, you can deduct the points you pay for your new loan, but there's a twist:  you'll have to deduct them proportionately over the length (number of years) of your new loan. So, if your new loan has a 30-year term, you'll deduct 1/30th of your points each year.  A couple of things to consider: if this isn't the first time you've refinanced your home mortgage, and you have points from the earlier loan that you hadn't finished deducting, you may write off the rest of those points in the year you refinance.  Also, if you refinance, and you used some of the money from the refinance for home improvements, you can deduct a portion of those points this year. For more information on the rules for deducting points, see Points Deduction Rules at <a href=""http://www.quicken.com/cms/viewers/article/taxes/54158"">http://www.quicken.com/cms/viewers/article/taxes/54158</a>  Q: We realized a large capital gain from the sale of real estate in the year 2000 and had to pay the alternative minimum tax (AMT). Our income for the year 2001 is much less than the prior year.  Is there any credit that carries over from the AMT? A:  Yes, there is - it's called the ""Credit for Prior Year Minimum Tax"" and it's calculated on Form 8801.  If you prepared your return using TurboTax for 2000 and you transfer your data into TurboTax for 2001, Form 8801 will be filled out for you automatically.  The credit applies only if your AMT was caused by something called ""timing differences"", which may or may not be the case in your situation. For a complete explanation of how the AMT works and how this credit is determined, see the Alternative Minimum Tax article online.

Astute savers we know have one trait in common - they're financially organized and proactive.  They know where their money goes, they stick to a budget, and they pay bills promptly to avoid wasting money on penalties and interest.  If you'd like to get organized, but worry that the effort to do so won't fit into your busy schedule, here's a tip.  The number #1 tool for getting financially organized is Quicken(R) 2002 Deluxe, personal financial software that helps you easily track and categorize expenses, set up a budget step-by-step, and get alerts when you are close to overspending or when bills are due.  Both Windows(R) and Macintosh(R) versions are available.  Order now and get the year off to a good start. Click here: <a href=""http://turbotax.0mm.com/tax027011"">http://www.quicken2002.com/online</a>  **********************************************************************  Tax Tips  Tip 1: Not sure what the due dates are for your returns or your estimated tax payments?  Check out our Tax Calendar! You'll quickly find all of the important tax dates coming up this year. Click here: <a href=""http://www.quicken.com/cms/viewers/article/taxes/36657"">http://www.quicken.com/cms/viewers/article/taxes/36657</a>  Tip 2:  Do you have a part-time business or are you fully self-employed? Take full advantage of section 179 that allows you to expense equipment you buy for your business!  The general rule is that a business can't write-off the whole cost of certain assets in one year. For example, if your business buys a new computer for $4,000, the law says that you must spread the tax deduction over five years. With section 179, you can immediately write-off up to $24,000 of qualifying property in 2001 instead of taking the depreciation deduction over a longer period of time. What is qualifying property? For most people, qualifying property is tangible personal property, such as equipment, office machinery, and furniture.  Tip 3: Do you find yourself spending your refund check before it arrives (even if you're spending it in your mind) and wondering when it is going to finally arrive? According to the Internal Revenue Service, the fastest way to get your refund is to file your return electronically. When you file electronically, you can receive your refund in as little as 10 days, compared to 6 to 8 weeks with a paper return. TurboTax enables you to electronically file one federal tax return at no cost, after mail-in rebate. The IRS also recommends that you file your return early in February or March rather then waiting until mid April.  To avoid delays when filing a paper return, remember to:  1. Sign your return. 2. Make sure that any supporting documents are securely stapled to the    front of the return. 3. Make sure your mailing address is correct. 4. Have your refund deposited directly into your bank account.  **********************************************************************  Product Features  Get answers to your tax questions - live - from a professional Tax Advisor.

Homeowners have the option to consolidate bills by refinancing or using a home equity loan - both loans can eliminate high interest rates and roll multiple bills into one manageable payment all while taking advantage of historically low mortgage rates.  And for most people the interest may be tax-deductible.  The idea of debt-consolidation refinancing is simple: use your home's increased equity to get a lump sum of cash to pay off your high-interest debts.  To see for yourself and get the facts, visit Quicken Loans new Debt Consolidation calculator to compare borrowing costs, calculate payments and tax savings, graph out payment options and other benefits of consolidating debt through a refinance or home equity loan.  Be sure to consult your tax advisor for more information on maximizing your mortgage deductions at tax time.

"                           Hot Off the Cyberpress!       A new GRANT'S publication is now available at www.grantspub.com.                 Here are highlights of the latest issue:   RISK IN A CHEAP STOCK      ""I'll bet if I told you 32 months ago, when we announced the goal [to double earnings per share in five years], that in the fourth quarter of 2001 Fannie Mae would report earnings per share of $1.40, up 59% from the first quarter of 1999, you would have guessed that our stock would be up by at least that amount."" So said Tim Howard, CFO of Fannie Mae, on the fourth-quarter conference call Monday.     He went on in that vein: ""I certainly would have. But it's not. At the close of business on Friday, the stock was up just 15%, about a quarter of the earnings growth. But if there is surprise or disappointment in that result, there also is promise. Over the past decade, our stock price has grown faster than our earnings per share. It just hasn't done so evenly. To the contrary, there frequently have been periods when, for whatever reason, the price of Fannie Mae stock has become uncoupled from its fundamentals. This appears to be one of those times. Neither our performance nor our prospects seem to justify our current valuation.""     By the sound of it, Howard was singing our song. . .   STOP THE PRESSES      The Wall Street Journal has capitalized the phrase ""New Economy"" in its news columns since at least Aug. 31, 1999, but it printed it small Tuesday. On page one, column six, it referred to ""the excesses of the new economy."" One of these excesses, so we proposed in the September 14 issue of Grant's, was the Journal's use of capital letters for an economy that didn't really exist (a dynamic economy is forever new and forever aging). And we proposed that a return to lowercase ""n"" and ""e"" would ""mark another milestone on the road to investment sanity.""     Regrettably, The Wall Street Journal Indicator did not flash an unambiguous ""buy"" signal Tuesday. On page A4, the jump of the Enron story referred for a second time to ""New Economy."" This time it was in capitals. . . .   MONTH OF TUESDAYS      The bear market and an unplanned recession have discredited the nostrums of the boom. However, faith in a homegrown American productivity miracle is largely intact, recent downward revisions in the data notwithstanding. On January 7, The Wall Street Journal reported new findings by a pair of authorities in the field, Dale Jorgenson of Harvard University and Kevin Stiroh of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York: ""[T]he likely scenario for productivity growth over the next decade remains a robust 2.24% annually,"" concludes their analysis. ""That's just a tad lower than the average 2.36% that helped the economy surge from 1995 to 2000.""     . . .Following is a new chapter in the Grant's revisionist history of the millennial productivity bulge. . . .   RESTING PLACE      ""Worst case"" may, for once, actually describe a commercial experience. The market expects that revenue per available room (RevPAR) for the U.S. lodging industry fell by 6.5% in 2001. In 1991, the latest prior recession year without a terrorist attack, RevPAR declined by only 2.6%. . . .   RISK IN A CHEAP STOCK      By refusing to surrender to thrift, the American consumer may be helping to perpetuate the kind of economy in which the funds rate hovers below 2% for a long time. . . .    ********************************* *********************************  PLEASE NOTE: Grant's Interest Rate Observer is taking its winter vacation and will resume publication with the issue dated January 18.  ********************************* *********************************   ________________________________________  This issue and more can be found at http://www.grantspub.com.

I have just returned from NY and want to thank you for all of your hard work in helping us track the data.  You and your team have been extremely responsive in trying to get the information that we need.   I apologize for making numerous requests but everything that you have provided us will be useful to SSB.     SSB has been provided with some information.  They will be incorporating the information that you have provided as well as information from the traders in their board presentations.  At this stage, I believe that we have done all that we can.  If I hear something further, I will let you know on Monday.   Again, thank you very much for all of your help.

Over the last several days, we in the research group have looked at ORACLE risk management databases and Enrononline data to corroborate the profitability numbers for power and gas trading.  Our analyses yield figures which are substantially at variance with what is normally believed to be the case.  Of course, there may well be information sources we are not privy to.  Moreover, we found some irregularities in the data which only serve to raise our doubts about the quality of the data.  As a result, we are not able to make an authoritative statement about the profitability of power and gas units. As we are not able to intepret the data ourselves, we have provided the spreadsheets so you can draw your own conclusions.  Thanks.

"vince.j.kaminski@enron.com  Following our highly successful conference last year in Brussels, we are now in the process of planning this year's event, which should take place by mid June in Canada.  Our previous corporate art conferences in London & Paris have demonstrated to various industry sectors the benefits of corporate investment in national and local community art, as a vehicle for marketing communications, in what is becoming a highly charged stakeholder society.  The conference will cover themes such as integration of art into corporate strategy, the practical issues of building and managing art collections and an examination of the legal and tax incentives as well as insurance, applicable to the North American market. We also intend to address the shareholders' and employees' reactions to their company being involved in art, and to research more practical matters such as budgeting and planning for a corporate art collection. Speakers will be invited to provide as many visuals and case studies as possible.  I am presently researching the topic with a view to identifying well-qualified speakers on the subject, and assess who would be prepared to participate in the conference as a speaker, delegate or sponsor.  If this message falls within the remit of another of your colleagues I would be very grateful if you could forward this message to them.  I would welcome your thoughts for the conference and look forward to hearing from you shortly.

" The ""Attack on America"" on September 11th and subsequent developments have necessitated a quantum shift in Safety and Security in the Electric Power Industry.  The treat and scope of malicious and purposeful sabotage today is much greater than that of natural disasters. The Center for Business Intelligence has developed the ""Safety and Security in the Electric Power Industry"" conference.

As a result, we are trying to determine how much people should carryover from last year, generally 40 hours is the maximum.  However, if employees were unable to use their vacation last year due to business circumstance (i.e. Mike Roberts group) or is a supervisor acted to limit or cancel and employee's vacation during the course of the year, we will be granting exceptions.   I have listed below individuals from your group who have more than 40 hours, and can be considered for this exception.  Please let me know if you would like to approve each of these or not, and your justification.

Ongoing investigations and pending litigation have made it difficult, if not impossible, to share information in a timely manner.  While we can't address certain issues, we can tell you about our initial plans to move Enron forward and emerge from bankruptcy, and we are eager to do that.  We had planned to hold an all-employee meeting tomorrow, January 23, at the Hyatt Regency.  However, we don't want to subject you to the media frenzy that would certainly surround such a meeting, so we've decided to postpone it.  We are currently making arrangements to hold a series of employee meetings within the building to protect your privacy.  We will provide the date and times to you as soon as the logistics for those meetings are finalized.  Prior to the employee meetings, we will provide an overview of Enron's new organizational structure.  You can expect that memo shortly.",vkaminski@aol.com,j.kaminski@enron.com,FW: Employee Meeting Postponed,2002-01-22 18:18:45-08:00,sent

I am still in a state of shock about Enron and I am still absorbing all the news I can.  It is almost unbelievable to me that the company I worked for this summer is now essentially kaput.  From the website I contacted you from, I take it that you are no longer with Enron.  Please accept my deepest sympathies and best wishes in what must surely be a difficult time.  I hope you were not as heavily invested in Enron as many employees seemed to be.  I wanted to contact you regarding letters of recommendation.  I'm currently looking for summer employment, in particular at network providers (such as AT&T and IBM) as well as some financial institutions.  Would it be any trouble for you to write a note on my behalf?  They may be requested via email, so an actual letter may not be necessary.  I would have more details later.  My best to you and your family and all those I knew this summer ---  Eric     On Tuesday 22 January 2002 06:05 pm, you wrote: > Eric, > > Nice to hear from you.

"   EIA to Display Draft of New Storage Survey at GasMart/Power 2002  Dulles, VA -- January 25, 2002-The Energy Information Administration will display its plans for a new weekly natural gas storage survey, as part of an extensive program exploring the wholesale gas and power markets at GasMart/Power 2002, March 18-20 in Reno, NV, hosted by Intelligence Press, Inc. In a special session Wednesday, March 20, 2002, EIA Senior Analyst Roy Kass will outline the agency's new weekly natural gas storage survey which will replace the current survey conducted by the American Gas Association. Due for release in early May, EIA's survey is expected to become the most critical piece of data informing the market. During the conference, attendees also will be able to visit EIA's Showcase area to see and discuss with its creators, the draft version of the agency's new product. In other sessions at the 16th annual GasMart/Power forum key natural gas and power representatives will come together to hear about strategies in the current low energy price, high security environment, and --- the impact on the competitive market of the collapse of Enron, the market's largest and most zealous supporter. Keynoter Richard Sherrill, Executive Vice President & Chief Operating Officer of Duke Energy North America will assess the state of the wholesale natural gas and power market, offering his strategies for instilling customer confidence in the face of the wrenching market disruptions of the last few years. He also will offer his views as to the market share for electronic trading and the outlook for electric restructuring?  Energy guru Ben Schlesinger will explore the impact of Enron's collapse on other marketers; on rules and regulations; and on the political scene.  Will Congress intervene to re-control gas and power prices?  How long will energy investors shy away from major commitments?  Are we in for another boom-bust price cycle? Did the skyrocketing energy prices in California and other parts of the nation in the latter half of 2000 and early 2001 carry the seeds of the current bust, weakening industrial customers, bankrupting the largest marketer, and ultimately reversing gains in the competitive market? In others of the 18 sessions at GasMart/Power 2002, Dynegy Vice President Peter Esposito and Jim Macias, Sr. Vice President of Calpine tell what's ahead for power generation. ?Williams Energy Marketing & Trading President Bill Hobbs and TXU Vice President Jeff Shorter assess the winter...Futures analyst Cynthia Kase instructs on technical market analysis ? FERC's Shelton Cannon, Deputy Director, Office of Markets, Tariffs & Rates, explores RTO development and the standardization of market design and market rules?Representatives of the California Energy Commission, the Cal-ISO, the Western Power Trading Forum, Bonneville Power Administration and Southern California Gas discuss various aspects of western gas and power markets?  Gordon Shearer, Poten Partners, and TransCanada Vice President Steve Becker report the latest developments on the LNG and Arctic gas fronts?and Richard Sharples, Senior VP, Marketing & Minerals, Anadarko Petroleum Corp. and Arthur L. Smith, Chairman & CEO, John S. Herold, Inc. strategize on how to survive for the long haul in E&P.

In many cases the same point was made by more than one person.  The similar comments helped me decide what was important, but I selected just one version to include in the writing.  You may notice that I have edited your statements to reflect past tense and otherwise to improve the flow of the overall text.  My intention is not to change the meaning of what you said. Please look the quotes over and let me know if these words can be used as they are written as part of the writing or if you want to change anything.  In either case, please let me know by email or by phone ((713) 871-8345 before January 30th).    I have assembled a great description about your group using your collective words.  As of now, the sections include: Beginning Efforts  Maintaining Effectiveness in Client Services  Guiding Principles of the Operations  Leadership  Personal Characteristics and Interpersonal Dynamics  Reflective Thoughts at the End Once I have approval from each of the 20 people who provided quotes, I will send an edited draft to Vince for his comments.  After that, I'll send the document to you for your comments.  Then I will focus on publication, although in the end, I expect that the document will have to be further pared to have a chance of being published.   I still believe that the experience of the Research Group was extraordinary in itself.  At the same time, the current publicity related to the larger Enron debacle may override the Research Group's story for a while.   In case you're wondering, I have not attempted to relate the Research Group story to current Enron issues in any way.

I appreciate your words. Everything remains fine, Vince. You are my  ""father"" here at Enron, and I admire and respect you greatly. I think I  know the kind of person you are, in terms of your integrity, and I admire  the high standards you set for all of us in your extended ""Group.""  I want to let you know I am not the only one in the group who doesn't  appreciate the way Maureen disrespects you. You remain the key external  factor in their success- it is not simply their own abilities that matter  to their futures but your own- Vince's- success with upper management that  matters.  We respect you, and we don't like it when you are disrespected. Maureen  didn't disrespect me today, Vince, she disrespected you.  It's time I told you something. Last April, Maureen, highly intoxicated  following a work-related function at Ninfa's, made an unsolicited predatory  sexual advance on me at my desk on the 19th floor. I was shocked and  disgusted, but I didn't say one word about this, Vince, because I played it  out and didn't want to put you into the position of having a raving Maureen  in your midst as you perhaps had to fire her and then endure a litany of  gender-bias crap lawsuits.  I ""took one for the team,"" Vince. I can'rt say I would do it again- Maureen  is brazen to berate me after what she did, in public no less.  I appreciate your bringing me into Enron. I've found a respectful and,  indeed, a loving work environment. I remain willing to do whatever I can to  help the Group.

I work for Aspen Technology Inc. www.aspentech.com We have not met, but a colleague of mine forwarded a copy of your presentation on Price Dynamics in the Energy Markets from the SIAM conference last April and am writing to you to encourage you to consider making a presentation at Aspen's corporate world conference Aspen World 2002 in October in Washington DC on this topic as well as the broader topic of Risk assessment and management in the energy markets. I know this seems a little strange making a ""cold-call"" in this manner, but I am reaching out in the community of Risk and Uncertainty management in the Supply Chain, Process and Energy markets to identify and solicit compelling speakers. AspenTech does not have a traditionally strong or well developed business or application layer in this realm, but, as our enterprise-wide reach and activities in planning, forecasting and supply chain have grown and integrated, I and the technology drivers in the company have been cultivating a demand and recognition for risk management and pricing activities to BE the next logical dimension to our growth and technology. Therefore, the session I am chairing (see the abstract below) will be one intended to educate, entice, and compel our clientele, business partners and staff on the business value, technology and mathematical and modeling technique. I would be happy to elaborate on the intended audience and opportunity for the conference. Please contact me at your earliest convenience by email or phone at the numbers below to discuss things if you think it would be a possibility or, if you would like more information on the context of the work and subject matter in AspenTech's core businesses.  Thanks in advance for your time.  Sincerely, Skip Paules  Uncertainty and Risk Management in Supply Chain and Process Modeling  This session will examine the assessment and quantification of uncertainties and risk in the supply chain and process modeling arena. The emphasis is on the modeling and enterprise business process aspects. Topics should include: point solution methods, such as design and real-time optimization application at the process level; planning and scheduling applications; as well as enterprise level solution strategies that balance forecasting, supply chain, planning, scheduling and operations. Commodities trading models, strategies and techniques are also included in this scope. What developments in the applications and theory of the field will allow us to take collections of deterministic modeling tools to the next strategic level where objectives for capital projects, operations, and supply chain optimization models incorporate not only economics, but also value-at-risk and/or robustness elements to create more broadly applicable or hedged strategies to achieve the desired goals.  Possible presentation topics will include:  *   Uncertain supply, demand in planning and scheduling *   Robust plant-wide optimization (real-time) *   Robust control *   Value-at-risk (VAR) quantification in modeling applications *   Dynamic hedging in commodities trading (e.g. energy markets) *   Flexible design and synthesis *   Model sensitivies to uncertain parameters or demand *   General algorithmic and modeling strategies for incorporating Risk, Sensitivity, and/or Uncertainty  _________________________________________ Granville (Skip) E.

"Vince,  Please find below some text for Eric's letter.  I hope it is helpful for your development of the letter.  If you have questions or would like some other information, please let me know.  Also, on the question of Enron letterhead, I suppose the desired form of submission is via the web site.  Unless you have electronic letterhead, the issue may be moot.  Martin  Eric Cope worked as a summer associate in the Research Group during the summer of 2001.  During this time, Eric worked on a variety of projects requiring a diverse set of skills.  In all cases, he quickly grasped the scope and context of the problems at hand.  While some direction was given in each case, Eric was often charged with developing the approach details independently, and he executed the tasks very effectively.  One major project for the summer was to develop a web-browser-based trading simulation platform (TSP).  The TSP would create user accounts, require user logons, post simulated market information, post simulated commidity prices, accept and execute buy and sell transactions for users, and track user account information such as positions, order history, and buying power.  The TSP would allow for the use of human users as well as software agent.  Simulated commidity prices could be histroical prices, ficticious calculated prices, or bid/offer prices based on some update algorithms.  The primary goal was to create a framework to test different udpate algorithms and trading strategies.  Eric immediately arranged for the appropriate reference materials to develop the database and associated software infrastructure.  In short order, a simple site was up for users to create accounts and begin ""trading"" commodities.  The project ended before extensive algorithm evaluation could begin, however, the TSP goes a long way to making such evaluations possible.  Other projects included the development of forecast models for motion picture box office revenues, advertising media placement prices, and long-distance voice telephony prices.  In many of the cases, data were scarce, as were definitive instructions.  Eric analyzed the problem to develop a focused approach, always in consultation and discussion with others, but never with ""hand-holding"" or intense oversight.  His co-workers and immediate supervisor quickly developed confidence in Eric's ability to take general direction and achieve productive results.  Such confidence and ability is crucial in an environment with limited structure, such as we had.   -----Original Message----- From:  Kaminski, Vince J   Sent: Friday, January 25, 2002 1:00 PM To: Lin, Martin Subject: FW: Reference request regarding Eric W Cope S05371/R966   Martin,  A request for the letter of recommendation.

"   -----Original Message----- From:  ""Robert E. Brooks"" <rebrooks@earthlink.net>@ENRON   Sent: Friday, January 25, 2002 1:57 PM To: 'GPCM Distribution' Subject: GPCM News: 1/25/02: Working with Power Model Forecasts: AGA Gas Storage   Working with Power Model Forecasts   Recently we have been spending quite a bit of time working with companies who are using both a power model such as Prosym, GE Maps, or IREMM, and GPCM.  These power models compute, among other things, the amount of gas burned at gas-fired or dual-fired generation plants.  These values are frequently then fed back to GPCM as electric generation gas demands.  The idea was that GPCM would produce the prices for the various power demand locations which could then be fed back to the power model for re-calculation of demands.  This iterative process would produce eventually a solution which was consistent between the power model and GPCM.  The difficulty with this idea is that the power model takes too much time to solve to make it practical.     After a lot of thought, I have come up with a different idea which has greater workability.  I would recommend the following:  instead of running a single power model case with an expected set of gas prices for each area, run 3 cases:  essentially a high, medium and low Henry Hub Price forward price trajectory plus best estimates of future basis to each power generation gas demand area.  The results will then be three gas burns at three prices at each location.  We can then construct a demand curve for each demand location based on those three points.  With those demand curves, GPCM can solve for an expected price - gas burn combination which will be an appropriately interpolated value between the 3 points computed by the power model.     When this is done, one final run could be made using the power model and the resulting GPCM prices.  It should produce gas burns very close to the value computed by GPCM and will contain all the information needed by the power modeling team.

"Vince You and I met last year when I had to opportunity to sit in your Energy Derivatives class.  I work with Wil Uecker and have been trying to expand our executive education programs for energy companies. The area that seems to have to most interest is trading and risk management. There seems to be a market, some of the faculty is working in this area, and it would leverage the facilities in the new building.  We are in the very early stages of thinking about this and would welcome your input and involvement. I have proposed that we design a fairly comprehensive program to cover the essential competencies which professionals in these areas master. The design should have input from both academics and practitioners. Once we have some outline of the content, we can address delivery options.  This is obviously vague, but I believe that it has the potential to be of significance for the Jones School. I am also aware that other schools are working on similar concepts. Please let me know if you have any interest in this initiative. I would welcome your ideas and the chance to meet with you.  Dennis W.

Best, John From: ""JP Crametz"" <jp@oncept.net> To: <johns@scudderpublishing.com> Subject: article submission Date: Mon, 28 Jan 2002 18:14:28 -0800 X-Mailer: Microsoft Outlook IMO, Build 9.0.2416 (9.0.2911.0) Importance: Normal Hi:   I would like to submit an article on a fast Risk Evaluation and Profiling methodology to the Risk Desk. Fast REP is a powerful graphical method to compare risk management policies. It focuses on extreme potential losses and potential pain points. While having some similar characteristics with the VAR (Value at Risk) framework and the Nobel-prize winning Markowitz model of variance minimization for a prescribed mean rate of return, it shifts the focus from an investment orientation to a risk management perspective extremely appropriate for a variety of industries, such as energy or telecom.   This methodology has been created by Stanford University Prof Sam Chiu and myself, and is now being applied as consulting services by Oncept. Attached is a copy of an unpublished article on the subject. We will adapt it or modify it to fit your editorial constraints, should you be interested. Please see below for a partial list of other articles published by the same  authors.

I work with Wil Uecker and have been trying to expand our executive education programs for energy companies. The area that seems to have to most interest is trading and risk management. There seems to be a market, some of the faculty is working in this area, and it would leverage the facilities in the new building.  We are in the very early stages of thinking about this and would welcome your input and involvement. I have proposed that we design a fairly comprehensive program to cover the essential competencies which professionals in these areas master. The design should have input from both academics and practitioners. Once we have some outline of the content, we can address delivery options.  This is obviously vague, but I believe that it has the potential to be of significance for the Jones School. I am also aware that other schools are working on similar concepts. Please let me know if you have any interest in this initiative. I would welcome your ideas and the chance to meet with you.  Dennis W.

The handout material is attached for members that could not attend.  The committee viewed a TV ad  for the Bauer College and a TV news story on the new AIM center and  Cougar Fund.  The first item of business was the Partnership program.  The committee agreed on the following levels:               Trustee            $100,000              Partner                50,000              Investor               25,000              Sponsor              10, 000  For this year,  these levels would receive placements in the new Energy Certificate Programs which will start in September of this year as follows: Trustee up to 10, Partner up to 4, Investor up to 2, and Sponsor 0.   All members of the partnership program would be able to participate in the Learning Community programs of seminars, forums, and symposiums free of charge with the number of attendees and special arrangements varying depending upon the partnership level.  The Chairman noted that with the certificate classes beginning in September, then the annual fee structure would need to align accordingly which left a funding gap for the first part of the year for the marketing costs to launch GEMI.  The original idea had been for the one time entrance fee in the Partnership Program to cover these costs but as you recall the committee did not favor that approach.  The Chairman asked the committee to provide ideas on how to fund these marketing efforts originally targeted at $200,000 for this year.  Dr. Kumar discussed three energy certificate programs to be available as 1) Risk Management 2) International Project Finance, and 3) Energy Accounting. The courses can be fully developed for the Risk Management and Energy Accounting to start programs in September (many already available).  The International Project Finance may require additional time because of development efforts on certain courses.  Dr. Kumar requested that the members identify people in their organizations that could give detailed feedback on the course proposals so we are assured they fit the needs of the Energy community.  We will also begin discussions with Energy committee members on what level of participation your forsee for your company.  Dr. Kumar noted that the BS and MS programs would be underway but less of an issue for course development as students would not be taking these more energy focused courses until junior and senior years.  He said that specialized training programs seemed to be of high interest and more activity than originally anticipated.  The chairman covered the feedback on the seminars, forums and conferences. There was real interest in seminars and forums but committee members did not recommend pursuing conferences at this time.  The plan would be to have in steady state 3 seminars per year which would be for large audiences with a featured speaker.  It was noted that the venue would be an important consideration to attract appropriate audiences.  Various suggestions were given on topics of interest with an overall view that the presentations should be practical and of high quality. The committee agreed that a reasonable fee should be charged to non members of the partnership program. The feedback on the forums was that they should be smaller more focused groups with different formats depending upon the subject matter.  The thought was that they could address overarching issues integrating energy and service sector considerations. Non members would not participate but selected student participation was seen as valuable.  A new concept of symposiums was introduced based on discussion with various committee members.  The idea of a symposium was to bring together important spokespeople and other key participants on a topic of high interest to the Energy community. The Bauer College would provide a coordinating role to address the issue with the objective of gaining input on all fronts.  Dr. Kumar noted that there had been various discussion with members around current topics emanating from the Enron collapse such as clearing house and credit risk considerations.  The committee was quite enthused that an imporant event could be created but it needed to be very carefully thought out as to topic and the management of the process including the media.  It was discussed that if the Bauer College wanted to sponsor such an event then it would need to provide a project manager.  Committee member companies would need to provide assistance/advice particularly on coordinating the media. Dr. Kumar will be sending out an e-mail to get your input.  Then Dean Warga would make a decision on whether to pursue such a significant event which could be a great launch vehicle for GEMI but also carried a series of risks.  Next, Dr. Kumar discussed briefly the trading center noting that the key issue was endowment funding before any significant activity could take place.  The college was continuing to think through the content and integration with other aspects of GEMI, the AIMs investment center, etc.  The Chairman then discussed GEMI's overall marketing image.  There was some fine tuning of the proposal providing further clarity and emphasis of key aspects of GEMI but in general a high consensus on the desired image contained in the attachment.  After the dialogue on the symposium, which would be a major marketing effort in an of itself, the discussion on external and internal promotion was tabled til next meeting.  The chairman noted that there would probably be a need for a two tier approach if the symposium effort was pursued.  The major focus initially being on the symposium then coupled with a growing effort on the overall GEMI marketing over the next several months.  The last item was the competitive assessment/relationship with other universites and organizations where the chairman discussed the current approach and principles in the attachment.  This received good support from the committee.  The committee members recommended the next meeting to occur in six weeks.  I will send out a separate e-mail on possible dates for you to consider.

My concentration is in finance, but I'm also an undergraduate engineer from Cornell University and an IT specialist.  I need help not simply finding a job, but perhaps some suggestions on how I can differentiate myself from my classmates in my job search.  I've been somewhat frustrated trying to explain why I'm more effective than my peers. Mike Roberts even said that I achieved more for the weather group in three months over the Summer than any other MBA achieved in a year.  This was probably due to my technical background and ability to put models into program code quickly and reliably.  I know this is a tough economy, but I just want a chance to do good work and show quick success.  What I can't say in my resume is that I'm the best in my class at finance, statistics, and information technology.  However, this combination is also my biggest crutch.  I'd like to engage all my skills, but typically, interviewers are only looking for one.  Do you have any leads to big or small companies that might be interested in my skill set?

" FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE Ongoing Legislation to Protect The Electric Power Industry to be discussed at CBI's Safety and Security in the Electric Power Industry Conference   Woburn, MA, January 30 2002--  Last night in his state of the Union Address President Bush had mentioned that they have found diagrams of American Nuclear power plants and water facilities in terrorist camps. The ""Attack on America"" on September 11th and subsequent developments have necessitated a quantum shift in Safety and Security in the Electric Power Industry.  The threat and scope of malicious and purposeful sabotage today is much greater than that of natural disasters. Therefore, the Center for Business Intelligence has developed the ""Safety and Security in the Electric Power Industry"" conference.  Power industry executives will examine the impact of heightened security measures on their companies' day-to-day operations.  Crucial factors that will be discussed include strengthening data security and protecting against cybercrime.  The planning and creating inherently resilient infrastructures and assisting policymakers in developing adequate legislation to safeguard the nation's energy supply and distribution.  Hear about Security measures that these industry leaders are adopting: Utilicorp United, Inc., Rochester Gas & Electric Corporation, PEPCO, National Regulatory Research Institute, National Association of Regulated Utility Commissioners, Electric Power Research Institute and many more.  Representative Jeff Morris of the Washington State Legislature and Chair of the House Telecommunications, Technology and Energy Committee will keynote at CBI's Safety and Security in the Electric Power Industry. http://www.cbinet.com/events/PB231/index.html  The Federal Bureau of Investigation will discuss how Houston's National Infrastructure Protection Center benefits the energy industry.  Join this outstanding group of speakers at the only conference that gives electric power executives the chance to benchmark their security procedures with peers and experts.   To register for this crucial conference please call toll free 1-800-817-8601 or email cbireg@cbinet.com or please visit our website at http://www.cbinet.com/events/PB231/index.html         ****************************************************************************************************************** To be removed from future mailings, please REPLY to this message and copy ""REMOVE 0000639675"" to the subject line.
