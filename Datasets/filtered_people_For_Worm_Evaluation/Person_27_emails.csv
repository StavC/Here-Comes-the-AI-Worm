For the time being, we are going to  work with them on another deal (which I will explain below) and we will  suspend the Swap deal that we were currently working on..  Eden - Siderca - Enron Deal  Eden has a full-requirement PPA (140MW) with a TOP of around 50 MWs with  Siderca that ends on May 31st, 2006. The contract price is approximately $30  /Mwh (adjusted with a formula) clearly out of the money.   The contract also  states that Siderca will have to pay $12MM penalty to Eden in the event  Siderca wants to early terminate the contract. We have proposed to Eden the  following structure:  Enron will pay Eden an upfront payment of $12MM so that Eden terminates the  contract with Siderca, and then Enron can transact with Siderca. Enron will  sign a MSA with Siderca selling (financially) for around 70 MW flat during  the term of the agreement. Enron will sign a MSA with a Generator (possibly CTSN - an AES Co. - or  Central Puerto) to buy (financially) 70 MW flat during the term of the  agreement. Siderca will sign a physical power contract with a generator for 70 MW @ spot  prices. Term of the agreement: Nov '99 - March '06.  One important point is to determine what will the concept for the Upfront  Payment that Enron will make to Eden. Fede and I thought about two options: Dummy Option or, Direct Payment to the Main Shareholders of Eden on an off-shore basis  I am attaching a slide were the transaction is described. If you have any  questions about the deal structure, do not hesitate to call either Fede or  myself.

Please let me know ASAP if anyone sees any problems with  this.  *We will have a formal ESA transaction approval and DASH signed by Diomedes  and/or Jim and others.  These approvals will be shown to Corp. Treasury, Risk  Management, and RAC.  1. Jeff Kinneman's team will execute all trades with the market.  They  function in this respect as an internal broker for ESA: ie, ESA will direct  and manage all trading decisions and they will execute.  Jeff reports to Gary  Hickerson and Greg Whaley in Risk Management.  Gary has been advised and Greg  will be advised that we will be taking a small trading position in these  securities.  Jeff's team has been restricted from trading any other Millenium  securities except at our request.   2. We will use the CayCo that owns PEP (Enron Brazil Power Holding XII) for  our trades.  Lynn chose this company for tax purposes, and Robert has  indicated that there are no legal restrictions on using this company.  James,  Diomedes and Joe are Directors of this company.  Joe can authorize Jeff,  Pedro, myself (or whoever) to execute trades of the CayCo.  Appropriate  corporate resolutions will be executed as needed.  3. Morgan Stanley will be the clearing broker for our ADRs.  The clearing  broker is also custody agent for the securities.  Sara is in process of  completing this application (as a domestic account).  MS is the primary  clearing broker and custody agent for most of Corp's stock purchases.  4. Jeff's team already has a trading agreement with JPM.  We do not have an  agreement in place with DKB.  We will execute that agreement once we have  clarified several matters with DKB.   5. Trades will be conducted in the following manner:  a) Pedro and I will discuss price targets/amounts throughout a given day b) I will place an order with Jeff's team.  If I am out, Pedro will speak  with Jeff directly.  Jeff's number is 713-853-5398. c) We will get execution feedback on the order from the team as well as any  market talk d) If the order is filled, Corp. (Atlantic Commercial Finance) will be  instructed to send funds on behalf of CayCo to MS.  Cathy Moehlman in  Treasury will handle cash movements and has been briefed on this potential  activity.

BONY is getting a legal opinion on the ADR issuance and is in contact with  Millenium's attorneys.  2. DKB has performed investigations on whether these ADRs must be restricted,  DKB's view is that they should not restricted.  This is highly arcane US SEC  law (so my summary is probably missing a lot of finer points), but my  understanding is that DKB views the sale of the local shares as a real sale,  with a public notice, a public underwritten auction etc,and there is nothing  restricted about the shares.  I don't think BONY would dispute that, but I  think their interpretation (and our legal view) is that the shares are  restricted because they are shares that were not registered with the SEC  under the original ADR issuance and, critically, they were sold by the  ""Issuer"".   That is, BONY's view is that BNDES is the same as Millenium b/c  they are both government entities--ie BNDES is the ""Issuer"".  Therefore,  regardless of the public nature of sale of the shares (and the fact that the  shares aren't restricted for trading locally in Brazil), the shares issued as  ADRs would be restricted per US law.  Now, ultimately we have to go with what BONY says b/c they issue the ADRs.   However, before we charge back to BONY and argue DKB's case, I would  appreciate a review by Skadden back to me on whether these shares if issued  as ADRs would be restricted.  We want unrestricted, NYSE ADRs if possible.  3. When the ADRs are issued, they will be issued to PEP, a Brazil company,  but deposited in one of the CayCo parents of PEP custody account.  We will  need to check Brazil law and revise our MS custody account accordingly to se  eif we can do this.  Sara, again I will try to call tomorrow, I apologize for  the delay.  4. The plan to move the ADRs out of Brazil is as follows. There will be no  sale and no cash movement.  There may be a CPMF.  PEP will perform an  ""in-kind"" capital reduction of the shares back to its CayCo parent.  This  will probably require some Brazil government approvals (or may not).  If so,  what are they and how long will they take?  5. Critically, we have been advised by Brazil legal and by US tax that the  shares if moved in this manner will move at the ORIGINAL COST BASIS.  IE,  there is no taxbale event for US or Brazil.  Lynn, please confirm.  6. I don't have a timetable yet, I will call BONY tomorrow for an update on  timing.

Robert, please call me tomorrow and we can get Gareth involved to help us  with all the issues.  Sara, I will also call you tomorrow to give you  background.    1. We will need to get in touch with our Brazil broker, who I assume is DKB  (Pedro, who and at what phone number?).    2. The broker will move our local shares to Banco Itau, the custodian bank.   3.  BONY will issue ADR certificates to a custodian/location that we  determine offshore (I think we would use PEP-Cayco parent, Lynn please  confirm company).  4. I think we will use MS as custodian (assuming account contemplates holding  physical, restricted securities--Sara, I will speak with you about this).  5. Theresa has calls in to Millenium to get ""ok"" and also is working to get  legal opinion issued on issuing restricted ADRs pursuant to original ADR  documentation (if I udnerstand the issue correctly).  6.  Once the shares are transferred, we will seek to do an ""in-kind"" capital  reduction at the PEP level up to its CayCo parent and hopefully avoid any  CPMF.  Also, we should be able to use original basis for both Brazil and US  tax and thus no tax impact, at leats this has been indicated to us.

From  tax standpoint, Lynn has determined that if we move the shares via a  capital reduction, there will be no Brazil or US tax (other than perhaps a  CPMF) since we will move the shares at their original basis.  So the price  doesn't matter too much--but I don't want to take any chances with the Brazil  tax authorities.  Better to move the shares now when the price is pretty even  than to move it later when the price has doubled; it would be a tempting tax  target.

Because their is a basis difference between RISI and OBM, we need to adjust the alternative floating price as RISI - $18.  RISI - $18 would replace DLK East - $10.  Thus there is an $8 difference between the two indices.  3) Under Annex B1, the would like for it to read ""either party (ENA or Tidewater Fibre) faces default situation"" instead of Tidwater Fibre Corporation  4) Under the collateral provision, instead of counterparty they would like ""Tidewater Fibre and ENA""  If you would like to speak directly with the counterparty, I can arrange that.

Enron Networks can then charge back all the appropriate companies for the cost as it does with all the other services it provides.  Since we do not have a master agreement between EBS A/P and Enron Networks, I propose that we proceed along the following path:  1.  Michelle - can you please contact the appropriate Enron Networks attorney and see if he/she will execute a Master Agreement of the same form with EBS A/P 2.  Marie - if he/she will execute a new Master with EBS A/P, will you please draft, otherwise will you please submit the new short form GTCs and we will paper the deals with the GTCs  Once we have confirmed the entities and the form of document, we can quickly issue firm pricing offers, get approval from Barry on the price and issue deal tickets and start the approval process  Molly - since EBS has already transacted with Enron Networks, are we required to go thru the entire CAF process or is there a shorter process?

Subject: AEGIS Confidentiality Agreement   I have been assisting Ron Bertrand in reviewing the proposed Confidentiality Agreement between Enron and AEGIS.  The original proposal was for a confidentiality agreement running to the benefit of AEGIS.  A subsequent comment from Sara Shackelton, however indicates that a two-way agreement is necessary.  As such there are several issues clauses that must be included to address issues unique to underwriting insurance.  Specifically (a) confidential information supplied in order to induce AEGIS to underwrite an insurance policy must be warranted (as in any insurance application), (b) AEGIS needs the right to share such information with reinsurers (who can be held to a confidentiality agreement), and (c) if a policy is purchased AEGIS need to retain the information in case there are any enforcement disputes that might turn on the application information.  The AEGIS standard confidentiality agreement used in underwriting situations is attached. With regard to the revised draft of June 22nd. I note, in addition to the issues mentioned above, that the governing law provision is somewhat contradictory to the arbitration provisions and that the assumption in section 7 that confidentiality provisions will be incorporated in to the definitive agreement is usually not true for insurance policies.

Can you ask the person from corporate about this?  If need be, I can go through that list and submit a formal request to have those individuals rights removed.  Let  me know how we should proceed.

It didn't made us look very good.  I would suggest that in the future that we open an entry in Lotus Notes when we are reviewing counterparty incoming guaranties so we have a record of them.

Our name has changed from Cross Timbers Oil Company to XTO Energy Inc. (a Delaware corporation)  Schedule to the Master Agreement 1.   Part 3.   We would incorporate the same language for Party B as applies to Party A with regard to the delivery of financial statements.  Our website address   is www.xtoenergy.com.  Propose that for both parties, strike the time requirement for sending financials in the event not available online (i.e. ""in no event  later than X days after the end of the X days following X period..."" 2.   Part 5(g).  We like to strike ""or otherwise"" from line 4 and line 6  Credit Support Annex 1.   ""Threshold"" needs to be updated for Party B to $60 million.  This is consistent with the threshold levels indicated in a letter from Jason Williams dated     January 5, 2001. 2.   ""Material Adverse Change"" for Party B we would suggest that the definition be rewritten so that if our credit rating with S&P falls below B+ that would be a    MAC (a two notch downgrade, and consistent with the change for Party A). In connection with this change we would propose striking the financial covenant tests (i) & (ii).  This would also apply under the ""Eligibility to Hold Posted Collateral"" section.  As a matter of form, this would permit us to strike the definitions    of ""EBITDA"" and ""EBITDA Coverage Ratio"". 3.   We'd like to remove Schedule 1 showing the form of letter of credit.  This is not consistent with our currently issued letter of credit, the terms of which have      been accepted by Enron. 4.   We'd like to propose that the limit on the Enron guaranty to XTO Energy be increased from $25 mm to $50 mm to give us a little more flexibility for future deals.  Questions/Clarifications: 1.   Could you comment as to why under Part 1 (e) of the Schedule to the Master Lease you have selected to use the ""Loss"" as opposed to the ""Market Quotation"" method?  We have no other ISDAs with this calculation method. 2.   Under the Schedule to the Master Lease, what is the rationale for Part 4 (f) Netting of Payments?  We found this a little murky.  Please call me at 817-885-2260 if you have any questions about this comments.  Thanks very much.  Regards, Adam Auten Assistant Treasurer XTO Energy Inc.

"We have been working on ISDA's with you for several of our subsidiaries (Georgia Power Company, Mississippi Power Company, Gulf Power Company and Savannah Electric and Power Company).  Up to this point, we have wanted to execute an ISDA for each of these companies.  Due to the way in which we operate our generation assets as a single system, we have decided that we need to change the way in which we enter these ISDA's.  We would like to execute a single ISDA with you that includes six of our subsidiaries.  This is how we have entered some of our physical trading contracts.  In this arrangement, the counterparty on Southern's side would be listed as,  ""Southern Company Services, Inc. as agent for Alabama Power Company, Georgia Power Company, Gulf Power Company, Mississippi Power Company, Savannah Electric and Power Company, and Southern Power Company""  By using this approach, we have more flexibility in entering trades and it provides even stronger credit protection for you since all six of these companies are on the hook.  Probably the best way to proceed is for you to forward your comments back to me from the last draft I sent to you.  I will then make the changes to reflect this approach described above and send back to you.  I look forward to receiving your comments back.  Please give me a call if you have any questions.

"Hi, Cindy:  Enron Corp. executed a guaranty dated as of March 29, 2001 in favor of The Bear Stearns Companies, et al, guaranteeing Enron Credit Inc.'s obligations under a Securities Loan Agreement and brokerage agreement that were originally executed by ENA and assigned to Enron Credit Inc.  Andy Fastow signed this guaranty.  Bear Stearns is now asking for certificates as to authority and incumbency, so I have prepared and attach them for processing.  In addition, Enron Corp. executed a guaranty dated as of February 20, 2001 in favor of The Bear Stearns Companies, et al, guaranteeing ENA's obligations under the Securities Loan Agreement and brokerage agreement that were subsequently assigned to Enron Credit Inc.  We asked Bear Stearns to return the original Enron Corp. guaranty and apparently they have lost it.  In this regard, I am attaching a form of termination for that guaranty.  If it is in order, please process it for signature.  Thanks for your help and if you have any questions or need anything else, please let me know.

The changes to the documents are the same for all three, with exception of the specified thresholds.  The only difference will be the thresholds as follows:  Savannah Electric and Power Company: 3rd Party debt for Party B changed to $10MM will be acceptable, Threshold of $10MM will be acceptable, and the minimum transfer amount should be $100M (not $500 as they requested). Mississippi Power Company: 3rd Party debt for Party B being changed to $20MM will be acceptable, Threshold should be countered to $15MM, and min transfer countered at $100M. Georgia Power Company: Threshold info, etc is located in the attached document.  I've highlighted all of my comments in yellow below.

The changes to the documents are the same for all three, with exception of the specified thresholds.  The only difference will be the thresholds as follows:  Savannah Electric and Power Company: 3rd Party debt for Party B changed to $10MM will be acceptable, Threshold of $10MM will be acceptable, and the minimum transfer amount should be $100M (not $500 as they requested). Mississippi Power Company: 3rd Party debt for Party B being changed to $20MM will be acceptable, Threshold should be countered to $15MM, and min transfer countered at $100M. Georgia Power Company: Threshold info, etc is located in the attached document.  I've highlighted all of my comments in yellow below.

They've requested a US$5 million parent guarantee from Enron Corp.  I don't know if this is standard, but they would like us to include some language that says we could review the amount in the future if needed.

They've requested a US$5 million parent guarantee from Enron Corp.  I don't know if this is standard, but they would like us to include some language that says we could review the amount in the future if needed.  But don't worry about this if it would slow things down.  Could you please arrange for a guarantee from Enron Corp?  How long does it take?  would it be possible to do it today (Wednesday)?

Dear Dog Loving Friends,  We hope this letter finds its way to you - and to your hearts. Like the rest of the nation, we've watched the events unfolding in NYC and Washington, DC with disbelief, with horror, with sorrow.  Unfortunately, so often during a crisis, our loved pets can be forgotten or unintentionally left to fend for themselves. Can you help us help them?  We are getting supplies of food, treats and dog boots for the rescue dogs who need nourishment and protection for their paws while they work. The rubble and steel can destroy and infect the pads of a dog's paw, rendering them useless in their rescue work. The search dogs are working so hard to locate and save human lives that they are wearing through their boots at a rapid pace. We want to be sure they are protected.  Supplies of food and treats will also be donated to displaced dogs and other pets whose owners cannot be there to care for them.  Please help. Mail your checks to:  The Gracie Foundation 1627 Main St., 7th Fl. Kansas City, MO 64108  Or donate by credit card by calling 1-888-535-DOGS (3647) or 1-800-4-TREATS (487-3287) Monday thru Friday, 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. CST.  Thank you in advance for any help whatsoever.

" Eric and Russell:  I spoke with Roeline Hudson at Torch just a few minutes ago.  She is having a medical procedure today and probably won't be back in the office until Monday.  She answered my question, so I will finalize drafts of the assignments and give them to one of the lawyers for review.  The lawyer may want verification from Torch as to the appropriate entity that is the counterparty to the transactions being assigned (specifically the Dynegy trades), which evidence of authority Roeline will have to send when she returns to the office on Monday.  Roeline stated that she has not received the additional documentation from UOM so she is not aware of any urgency in finalizing these assignments until all documentation has been delivered to us to finalize documents.  We will want to see the additional documentation from UOM before we send the drafts out for review.  Please let me know if you have any questions.

Recitals.  We do not see why it would be necessary to add that    ""The Guarantor will directly or indirectly benefit from the    Transactions between the Beneficiary and PMI"".  Please explain. [Heard,    Marie]    Because (i) it is a correct statement and (ii) it clarifies    the element of consideration which is essential for purposes of    enforceability.     2.      Section 1.  Considering that Pemex normally needs 5 business    days to request funds in foreing currencies to the Central Bank, we    need to change the payment date to be 5 Business Days after receipt of    the Payment Demand instead of 3 days. [Heard, Marie]    We are okay with    this change.     3.      Section 6. Jurisdiction.  We think that New York Jurisdiction is    a good option and probably the most experienced in terms of derivatives    trading, and therefore we prefer to keep the ""exclusive"" jurisdiction    of any federal court sitting in the Borough of Manhattan. [Heard, Marie]       We are okay with the ""exclusive"" jurisdiction.     The rest of your comments are acceptable to us.

Steve Lins, the City attorney had a couple of questions which I will attempt to relay without having a copy of the documents.  1)  I am assuming that he obtained a for legal opinion letter or document of some sort.  This document references a confirmation and we are not sure what this references.  Typically, it references a transaction, which in this case, there are no transactions yet.  He feels this reference should be deleted.  What is your opinion regarding this? [Shackleton, Sara]    If we have no transaction on the books, then he can delete the reference.  Marie:  Have we received an opinion from Glendale?   2)  We sent him a couple of form documents to facilitate the documents required under the ISDA.  One form ws a form resolution.  They have already received City Council approval to enter into financial tranactions and to enter into an ISDA with us.  Steve is going to get a certified copy of this Resolution.  Will this suffice? [Shackleton, Sara]    I'll review their resolution again.  If it references our ISDA and all transactions, it should be fine.  (This is part of the reason why we need a legal opinion)   When you return, I may try to do one last conference call to alleviate any unanswered questions.  I think we will have an executed ISDA with the City of Glendale by the end of next week.  I am going to be out there meeting with them on Wednesday.

Unfortunately, the outstanding    issues          relating to the Terms of Business Letter impact our corporate    policy.          If          you insist upon arbitration, it should be at either party's option       and          we          can agree to arbitrate in accordance with the International    Chamber       of          Commerce Rules.  Also, as you mentioned below, there may be    non-prime          brokerage issues that relate to the terms of business and,    therefore,          are          not adequately addressed in the terms of business letter.  We do    have          other          business relationships with GSI and again request inclusion of          limitation          of liability language in the terms of business letter.  I propose:           ""Neither party shall have any liability arising from this Letter    or       from          any obligations which relate to this Letter for any indirect,       special,          punitive, exemplary, incidental or consequential loss or damage.""           Please reconsider the foregoing with explanation.  I will be out    of       the          office 9/18/01 in the a.m.           All remaining documents have been completed and we will have them          executed          together with the terms of business letter.

There may be non-prime brokerage issues    that          relate             to             the terms of business. Not everything in the TOBs intersects    with       the          PB             relationship, certainly if you do other business with GSI.              Re the liability provision, I think your concerns are    adequately             addressed             in the documentation as drafted.              I would be grateful if you would come back to me as soon as       possible          so             we             can try to get this wrapped up today.

It seems to me that the terms of the    PB             conflict             because J14 conflicts with A3, that is, (i)  J14 conflicts with       Par.8             requiring the conclusion that English courts will not apply to    the          Terms             of             Business agreement and (ii) A3 requires that English courts       prevail.             Are             you agreeing with this analysis?              Also, there is nothing in the Terms of Business agreement to       conflict             with             the limitation of liability language of the PB applicable to    the       PB             (except             for silence on the matter).  You didn't address this point.  It    is          Enron             Corp. policy to include such language and I would like to limit       the             Terms             of Business in the same manner.              Can you call me at 9 am Houston time on Tuesday, Sept. 11?  or          suggest a             different time?  I am not trying to belabor execution of the    the             remaining             documents.              Thanks.

Arbitration -             more                appropriate to general terms of business which principally             contemplate                the                regulatory rules to which we are subject (SFA rules). In the       event          of                inconsistency, the terms of the PB agreement govern (clause       A3).

I have two points with respect to the Terms of Business    Letter             relating                to the changes made to the Agreement which I believe we       discussed          but                were not in a position to resolve at the time.  These are:                 (1)  Par. 8 Arbitration (which should conform to Clause J,    Par.       14          of                the Agreement).  I recall that we were discussing the    possible       use          of                arbitration in the Agreement (and existence of arbitration    in       the             OSLA)                so that we would not need to amend this particular paragraph    of          the                Terms of Business Letter.  Since we ultimately agreed to       English             courts,                I think we need to conform the Terms of Business Letter    which       will                prevail if in conflict with the Agreement.                 (2)  Par. 8 Arbitration (which should be limited in the same          manner             as                Clause J, Par. 11 as to limitation of liability).  I believe       that          you                and Angela agreed to the revisions in the Agreement.  Why          shouldn't                these be mirrored in the Terms of Business Letter?                 I look forward to hearing from you and completing the rest    of       the                account documentation.  Regards.

It has 3 bedrooms, 2 baths, 2 car garage w/ opener! We'll be closer to family, friends,Steve's work & hopefully have a better sense of community for Queen Isabel.  We're excited to say that we're just outside Tuscany, which is where a beautiful community lies with $300k & up homes.  Can't wait to have you all over to unpack, clean, paint, babysit & mow the lawn, so mark your calendars for Nov. 30th!

Now its stock is down, wall street is be= arish, and the CEO is gone. What went wrong?  by Mimi Swartz < <http://www.texasmonthly.com/mag/issues/authors/mimiswartz= .php>>=20 THE ENRON SKYSCRAPER NEAR THE SOUTH END OF HOUSTON'S DOWNTOWN feels like th= e international headquarters of the best and the brightest. The lobby in no=  way resembles the hushed, understated entryways of the old-fashioned oil c= ompanies, like Shell and Texaco nearby. Enron, in contrast, throbs with mod= ernity. The people hustling in and out of the elevators are black, white, b= rown; Asian, Middle Eastern, European, African, as well as American-born. T= hey are young, mostly under 35, and dressed in the aggressively casual unif= orm of the tech industry-the guys wear khakis, polo shirts, and Banana Repu= blic button-downs. Almost preposterously fit, they move through the buildin= g intently, like winners. Enron is nothing if not energetic: A Big Brother-= size TV screen frantically reports on the stock market near a bank of eleva= tors, while another hefty black television relaying the same news greets pe= ople entering from the garage. A sculpture of the corporate symbol, an E ti= pped at a jaunty angle, radiates colors as it spins frenetically on its axi= s; a Starbucks concession on the ground floor keeps everyone properly caffe= inated. Multicolored, inspirational flags hang from the ceiling, congratula= ting Enron on its diversity and its values; one more giant banner between e= levator banks declares Enron's simple if grandiose goal: ""From the World's = Leading Energy Company to . . . The World's Leading Company!""  For a while, that future seemed guaranteed, as Enron transformed itself fro= m a stodgy, troubled pipeline company in 1985 to a trading colossus in 2000= . It was a Wall Street darling, with a stock price that increased 1,700 per= cent in that sixteen-year period, with revenues that increased from $40 bil= lion to $100 billion. ""The very mention of the company in energy circles th= roughout the world creates reactions ranging from paralyzing fear to envy,""=  notes a 2001 report from Global Change Associates, a firm that provides ma= rket intelligence to the energy business.  This Enron was largely the creation of Jeff Skilling, a visionary determine= d to transform American business. Hired sixteen years ago as a consultant b= y then-CEO Ken Lay, Skilling helped build a company that disdained the old = formula of finding energy in the ground, hauling it in pipelines, and then = selling it to refineries and other customers. Instead, it evolved into a co= mpany that could trade and market energy in all its forms, from natural gas=  to electricity, from wind to water. If you had a risky drilling venture, E= nron would fund it for a piece of the action. If you wanted your megacorpor= ation's energy needs analyzed and streamlined, Enron could do the job. If y= ou were a Third World country with a pitiful infrastructure and burgeoning = power needs, Enron was there to build and build. Basically, if an idea was = new and potentially-and fantastically-lucrative, Enron wanted the first cra= ck. And with each success, Enron became ever more certain of its destiny. T= he company would be the bridge between the old economy and the high-tech wo= rld, and in February of this year, Skilling reaped his reward when he succe= eded Lay as chief executive officer. Enron, says Skilling, ""was a great mar= riage of the risk-taking mentality of the oil patch with the risk-taking me= ntality of the financial markets.""  The Enron story reflects the culture that drove American business at the en= d of the twentieth century. Like the high-tech companies it emulated, Enron=  was going to reinvent the American business model and, in turn, the Americ= an economy. Maybe it was natural that this Brave New World also produced a = culture that was based on absolutes: not just the old versus the new, but t= he best versus the mediocre, the risk takers versus the complacent-those wh= o could see the future versus those who could not. The key was investing in=  the right kind of intellectual capital. With the best and the brightest, a=  company couldn't possibly go wrong.  Or could it? Today Enron's stock trades at around $35, down from a high of = $80 in January. The press cast Enron as the archvillain of California's ene= rgy crisis last spring, and Skilling caught a blueberry pie in the face for=  his relentless defense of the free market. A long-troubled power plant pro= ject in India threatened the company's global ambitions. Telecommunications= , in which Enron was heavily invested, imploded. Wall Street analysts who o= nce touted the company questioned its accounting practices. Some of the cha= nge in Enron's fortunes can be attributed to the economic downturn in uncer= tain times that has afflicted all of American business. But the culture tha= t the company created and lived by cannot escape blame.  ENRON, JEFF SKILLING SAYS, HAD ""a totally different way of thinking about b= usiness-we got it."" At Enron, in fact, you either ""got it"" or you were gone= -it was as simple as black and white. It is not coincidental, then, that th= e color scheme of Skilling's River Oaks mansion mirrors the corporation he = once headed. Here, the living room's white walls shimmer against the mahoga= ny floors. Black leather trims the edge of snowy carpets. Billowy sofas set=  off the jet-black baby grand. In the entry, white orchids cascade from a b= lack vase on a black pedestal table that in turn pools onto cold, white mar= ble. There is only one off-color note: After almost twenty years, Jeff Skil= ling is no longer associated with Enron, having resigned abruptly after jus= t six months as CEO. Once, Skilling was hailed as the next Jack Welch (Gene= ral Electric's masterful CEO), as one of Worth magazine's best CEO's in Ame= rica (anointed in 2001), and even as a daredevil who hosted the kind of unc= hained adventure junkets in which, a friend told BusinessWeek, ""someone cou= ld actually get killed."" Today, he sounds more like Ebenezer Scrooge on Chr= istmas morning. ""I had no idea what I'd let go of,"" Skilling says of all th= e personal sacrifices he made while retooling Enron.  From a black chair in the white library, across from a huge black and white=  photograph of his daughter and two sons, Skilling clarifies. The demands o= f working 24-7 for Enron caused him to ignore his personal finances. Divorc= ed, he lived in a 2,200-square-foot house without a microwave or a dishwash= er. He almost missed his brother's wedding. ""Learning a foreign language-I = never learned a foreign language!"" he exclaims. He never once took his youn= gest son to school. ""I'm interested in the kids. You don't do kids in fifte= en-minute scheduling."" Travel: ""You can't go to Africa for a week and get a= nything out of it!"" Skilling includes the study of architecture and design = on his list of missed opportunities, then he stops and sighs. ""I'm not sure=  that fulfillment in life is compatible with a CEO's job,"" he says, finally= . Then his eyes lock on mine, and his voice, which had softened, regains it= s pragmatic edge. ""It would have been easy to stay,"" he says. ""But that wou= ld not have been good for me.""  He's a smallish, ruddy-faced man who keeps himself at fighting weight, hand= some in the way of corporate titans, with piercing cheekbones and that assi= duously stolid gaze. But the impatience Skilling once reserved for cautious=  underlings and dull-witted utility company executives is now targeted at r= eporters who have labeled his resignation ""bizarre"" and associates who are = bitterly skeptical of his need for family time. His shrug stretches the lim= its of his shimmering blue button-down, and his matching blue eyes look put=  upon. ""I'm surprised,"" he says, ""that people have so much trouble understa= nding this.""  PEOPLE WHO PASSED THROUGH DOWNTOWN HOUSTON in the late eighties or early ni= neties couldn't help but notice a funny and, for its time, novel scene unfo= lding throughout the workday at the base of the Enron Building. From nine t= o five and before and after, you could see people slipping out of the prist= ine silver skyscraper to smoke. They perched on the chrome banisters or lur= ked near the glass doors at the entry, puffing like mad. They always looked=  hurried and furtive, even ashamed. Whatever people knew about Enron in tho= se days (and most people didn't know much), it was often associated with th= at scene: Enron boasted one of the first nonsmoking corporate headquarters = in Houston, and there couldn't have been clearer evidence of its break with=  the energy world of the past. What macho engineer would have put up with s= uch humiliation?  But this company was a child of another time, that period in the mid-eighti= es when chaos enveloped the gas business. Federal deregulation of natural g= as turned a steady, secure industry, in which gas pipeline companies freque= ntly enjoyed a monopoly in portions of the areas that they served, into a v= olatile free-for-all. The situation was compounded five years later by fede= ral deregulation of the pipeline business. So it happened that a gentlemanl= y gas pipeline company, Houston Natural Gas (HNG) found itself under attack=  from Coastal Corporation, Oscar Wyatt's less than gentlemanly firm. HNG wa= s then run by Lay, a sturdy, taciturn former economics professor and Transc= o chief operating officer who had a passion for military strategy. (His doc= toral thesis at the University of Houston was on supply and demand in the V= ietnam War.) Lay, who was from Missouri and never succumbed-at least outwar= dly-to Texas brashness, had done well enough: Thanks to canny expansions, H= NG's pipelines stretched from Florida to California and throughout the stat= e of Texas.  HNG fended off Coastal, but to protect the company from other takeover atte= mpts, Lay nimbly engineered the sale of HNG in 1985 to a friendly Nebraska = pipeline concern called InterNorth, one of the largest pipeline companies i= n the country at the time. Then, a funny thing happened: HNG started acting=  in a way that would characterize the company for years to come-a lot like = Coastal. What the Nebraskans blithely labeled ""the purchase"" was being call= ed ""the merger"" back in Houston, and before long, following some particular= ly brutal politicking between Omaha and Houston, the company's center of gr= avity started shifting toward Texas, and shortly after that, Ken Lay was ru= nning a new company called Enron. ""Over time it became clear that Lay had a=  better vision of the future,"" says one person associated with Enron at tha= t time. ""He never fought change. He embraced change.""  Lay had won, but what exactly did that mean? Enron was saddled with massive=  debt from the takeover attempt, and thanks to deregulation, no longer had = exclusive use of its pipelines. Without new ideas-for that matter, a whole = new business plan-the company could be finished before it really even got s= tarted.  LIKE MANY PEOPLE WHO TEAMED UP WITH ENRON IN THE EIGHTIES, Jeff Skilling ha= d spent a lot of time in the Midwest, and he was self-made-at fourteen he h= ad been the chief production director at a start-up TV station in Aurora, I= llinois. (His mother would drop him off there every day after school.) ""I l= iked being successful when I was working, and I was smart,"" he told Busines= sWeek earlier this year. But unlike many of his Enron colleagues, Skilling = wasn't deliberate and soft-spoken and happy to go home at five o'clock; he = was anxious and excitable, and nothing, but nothing excited him more than w= hat he would come to call ""intellectual capital."" He loved being smart, and=  he loved being surrounded by smart people. He graduated from Southern Meth= odist University, went into banking-assets and liability management-and too= k on Harvard Business School, where he graduated in the top 5 percent of hi= s class. Then Skilling took the next step on what was then the new, souped-= up path to American success: He joined Manhattan's McKinsey and Company as = a business consultant, and that is where Ken Lay found him in 1985.  It is often said of Lay that his instincts for hiring the best are flawless= , and his choice of Skilling probably saved the company. Skilling was above=  all an expert at markets and how they worked. While everyone else was worr= ying about the gluts and the shortages that defined the gas industry, he al= one saw the parallels between gas and other businesses. And so in a world w= here credit was nearly impossible to come by, Skilling came up with what he=  called the Gas Bank, which contractually guaranteed both the supply and th= e price of gas to a network of suppliers and consumers. Enron would not be = a broker but a banker. It would buy and sell the gas itself and assume the = risk involved. And Enron would make money on transactions, much like an inv= estment bank would.  Skilling worked up some numbers and found them ""absolutely compelling."" The= n the McKinsey consultant took the idea to a meeting of about 25 Enron exec= utives. He had a one-page presentation. ""Almost to a person,"" Skilling says= , ""they thought it was stupid."" Almost. After Skilling left the meeting dej= ected, he walked Ken Lay to an elevator and apologized. Lay listened and th= en said, ""Let's go.""  The Gas Bank was not an overnight success. For months Skilling woke up in a=  cold sweat, sure he had ruined not only his career but the careers of doze= ns of colleagues who had assisted him. In fact, he had come upon one of tho= se divides that seem to define his life: ""I believed this whole world would=  be different, a huge breakthrough"" is the way Skilling puts it today, and = even if he is typically immodest, he was right. Fairly soon after launching= , the company sold $800 million worth of gas in a week. True to Skilling's = character, success turned out to be a matter of old versus new: He says the=  joke around Enron was that if a company's CEO was under fifty, ""We were in= ."" And he was in too: In 1990 Skilling finally left McKinsey and joined Enr= on as the head of Enron Finance Corporation, a new division created just fo= r him. In 1991 that company closed a deal that earned $11 million in profit= . After that, says Skilling, ""we never looked back.""  Skilling and Lay also realized that the Gas Bank couldn't work unless it ha= d a trading component. Myriad trades were needed to build the market that w= ould make the project go. But by buying and selling enormous quantities of = gas, Enron not only constructed a market but almost instantly came to domin= ate it. The company had the best contacts, the best intelligence, and the b= est access to supplies. That, in turn, attracted more customers who wanted = to be part of the play. With so many customers in its pocket, Enron could b= etter predict the direction of the market and could use that knowledge to m= ake trades for its own benefit-Enron could in effect bet on which way the p= rice of gas would go, as one might do with pork bellies or soybeans, but wi= th startling accuracy, thereby generating profits higher than anyone could = have ever imagined.  THIS CHANGE COULD NEVER HAVE OCCURRED without another change Skilling had m= ade: He created, within Enron, a new culture to match its new trading busin= ess. The idea was to build a ""knowledge-based business,"" which demanded a s= kill set not exactly prized by Enron's employees from the old HNG days. Mos= t were deliberate, cautious, responsible, somewhat defensive people, most o= f them men, of course-the kind of people you'd expect to find working in an=  industry regulated by the federal government. But now the company needed b= older people for its bold new era: that included anyone who wanted to make = money-lots of money-for themselves and for the company. ""Enron was going to=  create a niche for itself or die,"" one former executive explains. ""The peo= ple who had narrow views eventually were forced out, because if they had na= rrow views about other things, they had narrow views about the market.""  Skilling wanted smart people but not just any smart people. He wanted the s= martest people from schools like Harvard, Stanford, and maybe, Rice. And be= cause his firm was now acting more like a bank than a pipeline company, he = wanted to draw from the pool of recruits that would be attracted to the big= gest and best investment banks, like Merrill Lynch or Credit Suisse First B= oston. In addition to being smart, Enron people were also supposed to be ""a= ggressive."" You were right for Enron if you didn't want to wait until you w= ere thirty to close your own deals or move up in an organization.=20  You could see what he was looking for on ""Super Saturdays"" at the Houston h= eadquarters: eight fifty-minute interviews with ten minute breaks in betwee= n-the company might herd as many as four hundred people through in just one=  day. They were scored from 1 to 5 on their smarts, their problem-solving a= bility, their passion for hard work, and what at Enron was called ""a sense = of urgency."" People who scored less than 2.5 were scratched. The shrewdest = candidates knew how to work Enron before they were even hired: These were t= he types that automatically turned down the company's first offer, knowing = Enron would come back with more. The starting salary was around $80,000. Ma= ybe it wasn't a fortune-yet-but the signing bonus, about $20,000, was more = than enough for a lease on the obligatory Porsche Boxster or one of the lof= ts being renovated close to downtown. (Enron people didn't live in far-flun= g suburbs. Suburbs were uncool and too far from the office.)  For the lucky winners, Enron offered the corporate equivalent of a gifted-a= nd-talented program. New associates learned the latest techniques for struc= turing energy deals, and there were rotations at Enron offices around the g= lobe. The hours were long, but every possible need was taken care of. A com= pany concierge handled all the things important people couldn't be bothered=  with: picking up dry cleaning or prescriptions, shining shoes, cleaning th= e house, planning a vacation. Of course, a lot of people who worked for Enr= on never got to take vacations-they were too busy making money-but they cou= ld use the company gym and the company's personal trainers. If they were ov= erweight or wanted to quit smoking, they could join Enron's Wellness Progra= m. Massages were offered six days a week, from seven in the morning until t= en at night. ""They were so cutting edge,"" rhapsodizes someone involved with=  the company health care program at the time. ""They really thought about th= e psychology and what it took to keep these people going.""  Skilling handed out titles analogous to those at Wall Street firms-analysts= , associates, directors, and managing directors-but everyone knew that thos= e titles didn't really matter. Money did. Instead of competitive salaries a= nd decent bonuses, Enron offered competitive salaries and merit-based bonus= es-with no cap. ""If you really worked hard and delivered results, you could=  make a lot of money,"" says Ken Rice, who stayed with Enron for 21 years un= til resigning recently as the head of the company's faltering broadband div= ision. Or, as the saying goes, you got to eat what you killed. Gas traders = with two or three years of experience could wind up with a $1 million bonus= . And the more you produced, the closer you got to Jeff: Real hot dogs join= ed him glacier hiking in Patagonia, Land Cruiser racing in Australia, or of= f-road motorcycling in a re-creation of the Baja 1,000 race, ending at a sp= ectacular Mexican villa. ""Every time he'd speak, I'd believe everything he'= d say,"" one loyalist says.=20  And why not? By 1995 Enron had become North America's largest natural-gas m= erchant, controlling 20 percent of the market. But at a company where the b= uzzword was ""aggressive,"" that was no place to stop: Skilling and Lay belie= ved the Gas Bank model could easily be applied to the electricity business.=  Firmly committed to the notion that a deregulated market meant better serv= ice at lower prices for consumers (and untold profits for Enron), they bega= n barnstorming the country, pressing their case with entrenched power compa= ny presidents (who, with their multimillion-dollar salaries and monopoly se= rvice areas, had little incentive to change) and energy regulators (who wer= e somewhat more receptive, thanks in part to Enron's generous lobbying effo= rts).  But the biggest winner of all was probably Jeff Skilling. In 1997 Ken Lay m= ade him the president and chief operating officer of the company. By then, = the division known as Enron Capital and Trade Resources was the nations lar= gest wholesale buyer and seller of natural gas and electricity. The divisio= n had grown from two hundred to two thousand employees, and revenues from $= 2 billion to $7 billion. ""Mr. Skilling's experience so far with the turmoil=  in the industry has convinced him that he is on the right track,"" the New = York Times noted. Everyone would certainly have thought so: Enron and Skill= ing had totally transformed one industry and were well on their way to tran= sforming another.  ""FIRING UP AN IDEA MACHINE; Enron Is Encouraging the Entrepreneurs Within,""=  sang the New York Times in 1999. ""In the staid world of regulated utilitie= s and energy companies, Enron Corp is that gate-crashing Elvis,"" crowed For= tune in 2000. Wall Street was demanding tech-size growth on a tech timetabl= e, and Enron, in 2000, obliged with second quarter earnings of $289 million= , up 30 percent from the previous year. That year the company seemed to dis= cover a market a minute: Under Skilling, Enron was trading coal, paper, ste= el, and even weather. No one blinked when a London wine bar became an Enron=  client. People drank more in warm weather than cold, so why not buy a hedg= e against the usual winter downturn?  But most exciting to the financial world was Enron's entry into high-tech c= ommunications. Because of the company's marketing dominance, EnronOnline be= came another overnight success, handling $335 billion in commodity trades o= nline in 2000. Enron, as usual, made its money on the spread between the bi= d price and the asking price. Then there was the broadband business: To Enr= on, trading excess capacity in large, high-speed fiber-optic networks (empt= y lanes on the fabled information highway) wasn't that different from tradi= ng the capacity of natural gas pipelines. So Enron created a market for wha= t the industry calls bandwidth. Soon after, it also announced a twenty-year=  deal with Blockbuster to deliver movies on demand electronically to people=  in their homes. Enron looked like a company that couldn't lose. ""Its strat= egy of building businesses, shedding hard assets, and trading various commo= dities can help it do well even in an uncertain market,"" BusinessWeek insis= ted.  There was, however, another reason Enron did so well in such a short time: = the company's hard-nosed approach toward its customers. The old notion of c= ustomer service was based on the long haul-you had to nurse and coddle cust= omers to keep them. But Enron had new markets and new ideas-customers had t= o come to it. Over time, the company stopping referring to its business cli= ents as customers and began calling them ""counterparties.""  Skilling wanted the biggest profits on the shortest timetable: Gains were m= aximized by creating, owning, and then abandoning a market before it became=  overtaxed and overregulated. So if you wanted to launch a high-risk ventur= e quickly-such as Zilkha Energy's new high-tech approach to drilling for oi= l-you got your financing from Enron because a bank would take forever to un= derwrite the project, if it ever would. But because Enron invented its mark= ets and subsequently dominated them, Enron could set the terms of its deals= , from the timeline to the method of accounting to whether the deal happene= d at all.=20  While many businesses used what was known in the industry as ""mark-to-marke= t accounting,"" for instance, Enron used it on an unprecedented scale. The c= ompany priced their deals at current market value-but it was always Enron's=  idea of the market value; companies that balked at their pricing didn't ge= t deals. And while old-fashioned companies spread their profits out like an= nuities over a period of years, Enron took most of its profit up-front. How= ever many millions would be made on a deal that covered several years, they=  went on the books in the current year. If a few analysts thought there mig= ht be something fishy about what they called ""subjective accounting,"" inves= tors didn't particularly care as long as the profits rolled in. As the mark= et fluctuated and the landscape changed, the company might abandon a projec= t that had been in the works for months because its profit margins weren't = going to be high enough. ""Enron is known for leaving people at the altar,"" = says one former employee. Winning the highest possible profits for the comp= any could even extend to Enron's attitude toward charity. When a fundraiser=  for the Houston READ Commission, a literacy group, called on Enron for a c= ontribution, it was suggested that he start raising money for Enron's compe= ting literacy charity: ""Even the person who was supposed to give money away=  for Enron was supposed to make money for Enron,"" he says.  As Enron became more and more successful, the culture Skilling had created = took on a dark side: The competition turned inward. As one member of the En= ron family put it, ""It became a company full of mercenaries."" The change st= arted at the bottom. As Enron's domination of the energy market grew, most = of the recruiting frills fell away. New associates were treated much like t= he commodities the company traded. Global Change's Enron spies reported ove= rhearing orders like ""I need a smart person-go buy me one"" or ""Buy me an in= telligent slave, quick."" Enron had never been the kind of place where peopl= e sang to you on your birthday, but now the workaholism bordered on self-pa= rody: A Random Acts of Kindness program lasted only a few months. It was to= o disruptive. People couldn't get their work done.  And, of course, Enron had a program for institutionalizing creative tension= . The Performance Review Committee, which had initially been installed by S= killing in the Capital group, became known as the harshest forced ranking s= ystem in the country. Employees were rated on a scale of one to five, and t= hose with fives were usually gone within six months. (The PRC's nickname qu= ickly became ""rank and yank."") It was a point of pride that Skilling's divi= sion replaced 15 percent of its workforce every year. As one Skilling assoc= iate put it, ""Jeff viewed this like turning over the inventory in a grocery=  store."" Skilling's approach to business-get in and get out-had become Enro= n's attitude toward its workers. In time, it would become many workers' att= itude toward the company. Teamwork, never that valuable in a trading cultur= e, went the way of the eyeshade and the abacus. If protocol required an Enr= on higher-up to come from Europe to help with a project in the Third World,=  he might help-or he might not, depending on whether another, potentially m= ore lucrative project was pending elsewhere.  Everyone felt the pressure to perform on a massive scale at massive speed: = ""They were so goal oriented toward immediate gratification that they lost s= ight of the future,"" says one former employee. Anyone who couldn't close de= als within a quarter was punished with bad PRC scores, as were the higher-u= ps who had backed them. Past errors and old grudges were dredged up so ofte= n as new ammunition in PRC meetings that the phrase ""No old tapes"" became a= n Enron clich?. ""People went from being geniuses to idiots overnight,"" says=  one former Enron executive.  In such a hothouse, paranoia flowered. New contracts contained highly restr= ictive confidentiality agreements about anything pertaining to the company.=  E-mail was monitored. A former executive routinely carried two laptops, on= e for the company and one for himself. People may have been rich at Enron, = but they weren't necessarily happy. One recruiter described the culture thi= s way: ""They roll you over and slit your throat and watch your eyes while y= ou bleed to death.""  BEFORE JEFF SKILLING COULD TRANSFORM ENRON from the world's leading energy = company into the world's leading company, he had to make one more change: J= ust as he had done ten years before, Skilling had to purge the company of i= ts remaining old order. Where Enron once prized cautious executives who dea= lt with tangible assets like pipelines, it now valued bold executives who d= ealt with intangible assets. Pipelines, power plants-they may have been Enr= on's pride, but Skilling wanted them gone. Expensive, long-term building pr= ojects had no place when Wall Street was devoted to quick profits and enorm= ous returns on investment capital, and Skilling knew it. ""It wasn't the tim= e for long-term approaches,"" an Enron executive says of Wall Street's mood.=  ""It was the technology era.""  To rid Enron of the last vestiges of its past, Skilling had to take on Rebe= cca Mark, long considered his rival for the CEO's job. Mark was for many ye= ars the poster child for the Enron way: Young, attractive, aggressive-her n= ickname was Mark the Shark-she came from sturdy Midwestern stock but had th= e requisite Harvard MBA. Mark was largely responsible for the success of En= ron International, the asset-heavy side of the company where she developed = $20 billion worth of gas and power plants, which accounted for 40 percent o= f Enron's profits in 1998. For this she reaped breathtaking compensation-on= e Enron executive estimated $10 million-and adoring press clips, including = two appearances on Fortune's list of the fifty most powerful women in corpo= rate America.  But then Mark ran into trouble with a gas-fired power plant in Dabhol, Indi= a, one of the largest ever constructed. She had played the game the Enron w= ay: Taking Enron into a new market, she had finagled low import taxes (20 p= ercent instead of the usual 53) and hung in through 24 lawsuits and three c= hanges in government. But the time and expense needed to make India and oth= er Enron plants around the globe successful did not mesh with Enron's goals= , and Skilling's impatience with Mark grew.  Forcing Mark out, however, was no easy matter. Key executives left, divisio= ns were dismantled, but she remained. The truth was Enron didn't mind firin= g lower-level employees, but it hated to fire the kind of aggressive, relen= tless people it tended to promote. The company preferred humiliation-keepin= g a director in his cubicle, say, but failing to include him in the glamour=  deals, or kicking someone upstairs with a fancy title. (One particularly d= ifficult executive won a few years at graduate school, gratis.) A company a= s smart as Enron could probably deduce too that dispatching one of the most=  visible businesswomen in the country would provoke a public-relations disa= ster. So Lay and Skilling did something classically Enronian: They gave Mar= k her own company. Despite Skilling's contempt for asset-heavy businesses, = Enron spent more than $2 billion to buy a run-of-the-mill British water uti= lity that could serve as Enron's entry into the emerging world of water pri= vatization. Mark was put in charge of making Enron, yes, the world's greate= st water company. Azurix, as the new business was called, looked like anoth= er sure thing: Its IPO in 1999 raised $695 million.=20  But Mark had to succeed on Enron's increasingly abbreviated timetable in a = business fraught with political and emotional complexities. Water is not li= ke gas or electricity-owners and governments are a lot less willing to give=  it up, even for lots of money. The company stumbled, layoffs commenced, an= d confidence evaporated. By August 2000 the stock price, which had started = out at $19, had fallen to $5. Mark's resignation followed, and Azurix, much=  diminished, was folded into Enron. ""I think it's best for Rebecca to start=  afresh,"" Lay, who had been a mentor to Mark, told the Wall Street Journal.=  Or as one critic put it, ""They were more interested in destroying the old = culture than running a business.""=20  As 2000 drew to a close, Skilling was in total command. In December Ken Lay=  announced the inevitable: ""The best time for the succession to occur is wh= en the company is doing well,"" he told the press. ""Enron is doing extremely=  well now."" In February 2001 Jeff Skilling took over the CEO's job.  ALMOST IMMEDIATELY THE TROUBLE STARTED. Enron's domination of the electric-= power market made it an instant target in the California deregulation debac= le. Both PBS's Frontline and the New York Times took on Enron, portraying t= he company as a heartless colossus that used its influence in Washington (L= ay and Enron's political action committee are the top contributors to Georg= e W. Bush) to force old people on fixed incomes to choose between buying fo= od or electricity. Skilling and Lay appeared on camera singing belligerent = anthems to the free market, while another memorable scene juxtaposed one of=  the company's jackallike traders against a hapless state employee in Calif= ornia, as both tried to buy power online. The Times reported that Lay had t= ried to persuade a new federal commissioner to change his views on energy d= eregulation. The bad press was, to say the least, ironic: Just as the media=  was pounding Enron for its omnipotence, Wall Street was discovering its we= aknesses. By late March the stock price had slid to $50 a share from $80 in=  January.  Within Enron, the asset-based divisions took the rap for the decline. (The = India plant continued to be enormously costly, at least in part because of = constant turnover within Enron's management team.) But the California situa= tion was more visible and therefore more damaging, despite Enron's claim th= at the state had never built enough power plants to service its population = and never properly managed those it had. ""For three months Gray Davis did a=  very good job of blaming us,"" says Mark Palmer, a vice president for corpo= rate communications. ""We were a Texas company. There was a Texan in the Whi= te House. California was a state that didn't put him in office, and his big= gest contributor was a Texas energy company. Performance is going to take c= are of our stock price. The truth will take care of Gray Davis."" (Californi= a utilities still owe Enron $500 million, another reason stockholders might=  be panicky.) But more problematic than the crisis itself was Skilling's al= l too apparent lack of contrition. Facing down his critics, he cracked a jo= ke comparing California with the Titanic. (""At least the Titanic went down = with its lights on."")  But the biggest problem was Enron's telecommunications division, which had = been responsible for at least one third of its heady stock price. Investors=  believed that Enron could revolutionize high-speed communications, just as=  it had revolutionized gas and power. Enron estimated the global market for=  buying and selling space over fiber-optic cable would grow from $155 billi= on in 2001 to $383 billion by 2004-but then the tech bubble burst. So too d= id the much-hyped movies-on-demand deal with Blockbuster. For the first tim= e in its confoundingly successful life, Enron had nothing new to take to ma= rket. Like the popular high school girl who suddenly packs on a few pounds,=  Enron suddenly looked less alluring to Wall Street.  Skilling launched a campaign to keep Enron's most important cheerleaders, t= he stock analysts, in the tent, but he wasn't cut out to be a supplicant. D= uring the reporting of first quarter profits, he called an analyst who chal= lenged Enron's financial reporting an ""asshole."" When the company reported = hefty second quarter profits, many analysts questioned whether those profit= s had come from the generation of new business or from the sale of old asse= ts. Ignoring the growing chorus critical of Enron's accounting, Skilling pr= omised, as he always had, that innovations were just around the corner. ""Th= ere wasn't any positive news,"" Carol Coale, of Prudential Financial, says n= ow. ""Basically, he talked me out of a downgrade.""  The business press, so generous in the past, turned surly. Fortune had aske= d in March whether Enron was overpriced. (""Start with a pretty straightforw= ard question: How exactly does Enron make its money?"") The routine cashing = in of stock options that were about to expire by key executives was portray= ed in the media as a fire sale. (Skilling had sold $33 million worth, Ken L= ay and Ken Rice close to four times that amount.) Then the Wall Street Jour= nal reported on a fund run by the CFO that had been a source of strife with= in the company. (It was essentially risk management against Enron's possibl= e failures.) Every negative story seemed to produce a concurrent drop in th= e stock price: By late August it had fallen below $40. Enron, so institutio= nally unforgiving, finally got a taste of its own medicine. ""When Wall Stre= et is in love with a stock, they're forgiving of something like accounting,= "" says Carol Coale. ""When a company falls out of favor, all these issues ca= rry more weight.""  This fact was not lost on people inside the company, who suddenly started e= xperiencing an attack of conscience. Those who had looked the other way as = the most powerful Enron executives dumped their wives and married their sec= retaries or carried on flagrant interoffice affairs now saw the error of th= eir ways. ""It just created an attitude,"" one executive still at Enron says.=  ""If senior people are doing that, why are we held to a higher standard? Th= ere was a real culture of 'We're above everyone else.'""=20  Loyalty had never been prized at Enron, so there was no reason to expect it=  now. An old-fashioned, slow-moving company like Exxon could demand hardshi= p duty in Baku with the promise of greater rewards down the road. ""But,"" as=  one Houston oilman explains, ""if you have to negotiate a hardship duty wit= h someone who doesn't have loyalty and has money, then you have a corporati= on that's better suited for good times than bad.""  As it turned out, that description applied to Jeff Skilling too. As the sto= ck price stubbornly refused to ascend, he made no secret of his unhappiness=  and frustration. Then, after a trip to visit the families of three employe= es killed at a plant in England, he had an epiphany: Life was short; for hi= m, Enron was over. Ever stoic, Ken Lay returned to the CEO's office, named = a new president, arranged a trip to New York to calm analysts and investors= , and promised a kinder, gentler Enron in the future. Trading anything and = everything was out. The company, Lay says, will still innovate but ""innovat= e much closer to our core."" As for the culture: ""Things like the Performanc= e Review Committee, I think we could have applied better. By trying to cate= gorize people into so many different categories, you ended up creating a mo= rale problem.""  That Skilling's supposedly brilliant colleagues were as shocked at the news=  of his departure as the rest of the business community may be testament to=  their lack of emotional intelligence. Despite Skilling's lengthy tenure wi= th Enron, he'd always been contemptuous of the long haul; he'd always belie= ved in cutting losses and moving on. But now that he was abandoning them wh= en the company was in trouble, it was different. ""Even Jeff's biggest detra= ctors wouldn't have wanted him to walk out the door,"" one loyalist admits.  But on the day we meet, Skilling is looking forward, not back. ""Look,"" he s= ays with finality, ""ninety percent of my net worth is in Enron. Were my int= erests aligned with the shareholders? Absolutely.""  Free of falling stock prices and shareholder pressures, he is nestling hims= elf back into the world of ideas. His eyes flash as he talks about new tech= nologies. ""The first wave never gets it right,"" he says. ""The stand-alone d= ot-coms didn't work, but the technological applications will create a secon= d wave that will change the world."" Houston, he promises, will become the w= orld's center of commodity trading, and he intends to be a part of it. In f= act, he is already shopping for office space.  ""This is the second wave, and Enron's got it,"" he says, almost breathless. = ""There are thousands of people running around the streets of Houston that g= et it.""",marie.heard@enron.com,tana.jones@enron.com,FW: Texas Monthly (November 2001): How Enron Blew It,2001-10-25 15:56:50-07:00,received

"Reminder - If you are working on a Master Netting Agreement, you also need to understand what type of entities are being included in the netted group.  On the power side, there are regulatory restrictions on a regulated utility from becoming a guarantor of the debts of unregulated companies;  accordingly,  an MNA with a regulated utility and other unaffiliated parties on its side will not work, particularly if you are posting collateral on a fully netted basis.  In this case, the only option would be to keep the underlying margining agreements in place (no new global collateral annex) and have the MNA only be a cross default and acceleration and  possible setoff (just in case the money is going the right way and/or just in case it works).

As we indicated, we are interested in pursuing implementing the agreement.  However, we are concerned that the cross-affiliate netting provision may not be enforceable. This concern has resulted in two important changes that are reflected in the attached markup:  (i) we have changed the severability clause to provide that the agreement would survive even if Section 3 is not enforceable and (ii) we have removed the collateral provisions that are predicated on the operation of cross-affiliate netting.

Be sure to verify that the underlying contracts do not allow cherry picking under any default scenario.  If it does, amend the express language.  2.  We have made 2 changes to the netting agreement forms on the basis of further review by Leslie Hansen of some provisions in our trading forms.  The first change is in paragraph 2(a) to clarify the definition of Default.  The second change is in paragraph 14(b) to delete the day limitation on claims of Force Majeure.  We feel this should not be included in any physical contract that will be included in a master netting agreement, especially because of the current international situation and security concerns.  See attached reline version to read the changes.   <<MASTER NETTING & SECURITY AGMNT 10 H V1 RED.DOC>> 3.  No changes have been made to the Collateral Annex.  4.  Attached below are the new forms.  Rather than continue with forms with and without the user notes, I put the user notes in a separate document.  They are not at the back of the forms.  Simpler.   <<Master Netting User Notes.doc>>  The attached forms are Master Netting & Security Agmnt 10 h a v1 (to use without collateral annex) and Master Netting & Security Agmnt 10 h v1 (to use with collateral annex).   <<Master Netting & Security Agmnt 10 h a v1.doc>>  <<Master Netting & Security Agmnt 10 h v1.doc>>   Cordially, Mary Cook Enron North America Corp. 1400 Smith, 38th Floor, Legal Houston, Texas 77002-7361 (713) 345-7732 (713) 646-3393 (fax) mary.cook@enron.com    ********************************************************************** This e-mail is the property of Enron Corp. and/or its relevant affiliate and may contain confidential and privileged material for the sole use of the intended recipient (s).

My instructions were to prepare execution copies, have them signed on behalf of the various Dynegy entities, and they are being hand delivered to Mr. Bradford in your credit group for execution on behalf of the various Enron entities.  I also prepared guaranty agreements from Dynegy Holdings and from Enron Corp., each of which has been either executed or acknowledged on behalf of Dynegy.  The decision upstairs was that this final version was ""take it or leave it"" for Enron.  A summary of the major changes:  1.   All margining language and references to Collateral were removed. 2.   All operating Underlying Master Agreements were included. 3.   The ""Group"" payment concept was eliminated in Section 4 because it was not clear who would actually be making the payment.  Thanks.

Both trades need to be rebooked to reflect the fact that AIG allocates all its trades between 2 entities: AIG Commodity Arbitrage Fund Ltd and AIG Commodity Arbitrage Fund LP. The split between the 2 counterparties is: 77% to Ltd and 23% to LP.   At the moment, the original trade as well as (I'm assuming) the offsetting one are booked only to LP. Please rebook the trades, changing both the tick size and the cap amount, to reflect the above allocations. By my calculation, they should be as follows:  Entity    Tick Size   Cap AIG Commodity Arb. Fund. Ltd $1540    $308,000 AIG Commodity Arb. Fund  LP $460    $92,000  Once the deals are rebooked, please also reconfirm them this way.

"Hello Marie -  Yes, I got both of your e-mails.  Thanks very much.  I will call Eric again and tell him to trace those documents because neither of us has them.  I really don't know what the problem is, because he used to be so prompt and efficient.  I will keep you posted.  In the meantime I will send the other documents to you today or at the latest tomorrow.  I am so sorry about what is happening with Enron.  Yes, it is a total shock - and we are thinking, if it can happen to Enron, it can happen to any company.  I will keep my fingers crossed for you - in hopes that your services will be retained.  I cannot imagine what it will be like to have so many ex Enron employees (and possibly some ex Dynegy employees) flood the market - and with less and less companies to work for.  Like Conoco and Phillips - that are now going to be one company also.  I am now sitting in a trade room that used to have 20 people - and was so busy and loud.  Now I am all by myself, most transferred out and some were laid off.  Torch is trying to find work for me to do as well - but you know too how that can work out, I think I am working it week by week.  I am keeping my ears to the ground..... especially after the New Year.  Good luck to you Marie - and Happy Thanksgiving as well.  This year has not gone well for many people - so surely the new year will be different.  I hope so - I expect so.   > -----Original Message----- > From: Heard, Marie [SMTP:Marie.Heard@enron.com] > Sent: Monday, November 19, 2001 11:01 AM > To: HudsonR@teai.com > Subject: FW: Executed Assignments > > > Don't know if my response reached you or not.

Change definition of BNPP Party to ""means each of BNPP, PFI and BNPPCML.""  3.   Change definition of Enron Party to "" means each of Enron, ENA, EPMI, ECTRIC, ERMTIC, ECL, EML and ECTD.""  4.

In Section 2(b), at the end of (ii) and (v) before the semi-colon, insert the following:       , under any other agreement or under applicable law or equity, whether      in respect of the Transactions thereunder, or otherwise  7.

In Section 15(b), following the words ""on the basis of a payment owed"", insert the words ""(including margin)"".  12.   With respect to Section 17, our client has indicated that it would not be useful or efficient to have the issue of arbitration (which is clearly not central to the risk reducing purposes of the arrangements) mixed up with the proposed agreement, which has arisen from the circumstances of Enron that have developed over the last few months.  BNP Paribas' primary reason for not wanting to include an arbitration clause (even with the suggested language changes) is that, although the concept of arbitration is being considered generally, BNP Paribas has, of yet, not made any definitive decisions as to the implicit or necessary value of arbitration clauses and such a decision would require significant internal review and discussion.  Over the next few months, further consideration can be given as to including arbitration in this agreement.  13.

"We have received an executed Amendment Agreement dated as of September 19, 2001 between The Chase Manhattan Bank and Enron North America Corp.  The amendment (i) amends the definition of ""Specified Swap"" to include foreign exchange spot or foreign exchange forward transactions or currency option transactions; (ii) to specify that The Chase Manhattan Bank is a Multibranch Party and may act through any Office specified in a confirmation; and (ii) to add a ""Scope of the Agreement"" provision which states that if the parties enter into a ""Specified Swap"" (as defined in the master agreement) such ""Specified Swap"" shall be subject to, governed by and construed in accordance with the terms of the agreement unless the confirmation relating thereto specifically states to the contrary.

It is imperative that this master netting agreement be executed as soon as possible tomorrow morning (11/27), so I am asking your assistance in getting this document signed.  The UK entities to sign are EEFT, Enron Capital & Trade Resources Limited, Enron Credit Limited and Enron Metals Limited.  Please leave the signature pages as set forth on the attached document, as Enron Metals may be deleted from the agreement.  At this point, we aren't sure, so we will have it sign on a separate page and then if they are not a party to the agreement, we will omit their signature page.    Please take whatever steps are necessary to have the attached document signed ASAP.  Harlan Murphy (713/345-2679 is the lawyer here in Houston who prepared the document.  Please contact either Harlan, Mary Cook (713/345-7732), Elizabeth Sager (713/853-6349) or Carol St. Clair (713/853-3989) if you have any questions.

"Hi, Robbi!  I've been meaning to call you, but as you can imagine, it's been extremely busy here.  Hope you're okay and I'll try to talk with you soon.  No, we still haven't received anything from Robert Allen to return our fabric.  I was hoping they would send something last week, because we shipped our gifts to Washington and we could have sent it at the same time.  Let me know what you hear from them.  Let's try to get together after the 1st.  I know it's going to be too busy this week and next, so why don't we shoot for after the new year.  If I don't talk to you soon have a Merry Christmas and Happy New Year!

"      What do you call a polar bear wearing ear muffs?  Anything you want.  He can't hear you!    Just before Christmas, an honest politician, a generous  lawyer and  Santa Claus were riding in the elevator of  a very posh hotel. Just before  the doors opened they all  noticed a $20 bill lying on the floor. Which one  picked it up?  Santa of course, because the other two don't exist!    What happened when Santa's cat swallowed a ball of yarn?  She had  mittens.      What do you call it when your Christmas tree explodes?  A tannen-bomb.
