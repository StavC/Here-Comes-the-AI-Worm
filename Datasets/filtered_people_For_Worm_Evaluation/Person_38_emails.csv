"Scott-- Something for you to consider: If the transport people are to have their own books, my belief is that the  curve setting used for the transport values ought to be as unbiased as  possible.  This means using as few ""formula based"" curves as possible and as  many Gas Daily publication postings as possible.  I'm not sure how you or  your traders feel about the following postings, (how realistic they are), but  I think they bear watching to see if they could be used for calculating  transport p&l.  In Gas Daily, under Citygate, Pooling Point Prices, there are  Mid Atlantic Citygates postings for both CNG and Columbia Gas.  These could  potentially be used for CNG North & South Citygates and TCO citygates.  The  only thing I have to confirm is how these would load since there is no index  posted each day--it is a range of prices instead.  Historically TCO and CNG citygate postings haven't been much of an issue  because we haven't held much transport on CNG and TCO, but with the CES  business in our portfolio, the times have changed.  Currently we are using  ""formula based"" curves set by the traders to calculate CNG and TCO transport  p&l, and there sure seems to be a huge difference between the postings and  how we are marking the curves.  For example, today's Gas Daily postings  compared to our curve markings are as follows: GAS DAILY   GAS DAILY SPREAD   SPREADS per TRADERS CURVES TCO pool $2.985   $1.565     $.10 TCO citygate $4.55  CNG North $3.39   $  .585     $.16 CNG South $3.305   $  .670     $.16~ CNG Citygate $3.975  Obviously there are huge differences, so someone must be wrong.  There are  two solutions that I see.  One is to switch to the Gas Daily posting, which  in my mind is preferable if you believe the postings are accurate; the other  solution is to have the traders change their curves more often to more  closely reflect the actual spreads in the marketplace.  That's up to you.   Obviously if we believe the postings are completely off base and our spreads  are more accurate, then nothing needs to be done, but if you want to know  what you're really making on your transport (and you now have a lot of it),  we need to focus on it being accurate.  Anyway, let me know what you decide and I'll either forget about it or work  on getting the Gas Daily postings pulled into the calculations.       ---------------------- Forwarded by Colleen Sullivan/HOU/ECT on 02/03/2000  08:29 AM ---------------------------          From:  David Oliver                           02/02/2000 12:56 PM    To: Colleen Sullivan/HOU/ECT@ECT, Mark Friedman/HOU/ECT@ECT cc:   Subject: Transport formula settles  Colleen,  Mark wanted me to let you know where a few city gate points are settling  daily:  CNG North City Gate = GD CNG North +.16 CNG South City Gate = Settles at what the intra-month trader sets their  intra-month curve at.

For your information,  Chris Germany has the final spreadsheet that has all the term volumes and  prices in it.

Please talk to Chris before entering any of the East Desk deals, since he  indicated that he may want to enter these deals because of the complexity of  them; however, I want to make sure they get run through TAGG, etc.  Anyway,  there are very few Central Desk deals and they definitely need to be put in  by your group (I think you're the right one).

"This is just FYI-  I think we really need to ask Dan, Judy and Chris to dedicate some time to  map the market area points accurately.  (What I mean is making sure each  location has the proper valuation attached to it in Sitara.)  Just so you  know, when I print out the market area transport p&l, there are 85  tickets/paths set up, and only 19 of those show a positive p&l.  I know that  we are not using that much transport that is out of the money--I'm sure this  is just a case of no one going in and making sure the mappings for each  location in the market area are accurate.  I would just go ahead and do this,  but I I do not know the market area points and valuations well enough.  There  are a few simple things I could point out that need fixing (i.e., TCO pool vs  TCO citygate--as prices go up and cost of fuel goes up, no one is adjusting  the curves between the two points, so your transport starts out in the money  and ends up out of the money; another example is CNR--the gathering charge on  CNR is now $.44, but we still have our curve set at TCO pool minus $.32.)  Anyway, I know the market area is a bit more difficult because of valuation  issues, but I have to believe we could do better than 19 out of 85.  (And on  some pipes, like Tennessee, the ration is 0/33).  I know this is a pain to fix, but one day I do envision that we will have  automatic notification of capacity being in or out of the money, but that  will be meaningless if we are not set up to value points properly.

FRANCE: PDVSA sees Enron LNG deal soon, seeks gas funds.  06/07/2000 Reuters English News Service (C) Reuters Limited 2000.  NICE, France, June 7 (Reuters) - Venezuela's state oil company Petroleos de Venezuela (PDVSA) said on Wednesday it expected to sign a contract with U.S. energy company Enron by June 30 to construct an LNG plant in Jose with an annual capacity of two million tonnes.  It has signed an agreement with Royal Dutch Shell , ExxonMobil and Mitsubishi to begin construction of a four-million-tonne LNG plant in Paria by end of the year. ""We could sign the contract to start the project (with Enron) by June 30...The plant should be operational by 2004,"" Domingo Marsicobetre, chairman of PDVSA's gas division, told reporters at the world gas congress in Nice.  ""The project development agreement was signed with Shell, Exxon and Mitsubishi last month. In September we will declare the viability of the project and then create a (separate) Venezuelan LNG company (to run it). The milestone is December,"" Marsicobetre said.  The Paria plant was expected to be operational by 2005, he said, adding that the consortium hoped to explore further oil and gas in the Orinoco delta platform, south of Trinidad, to add a second and third train to the plant. ""In August a decision will be taken by the shareholders,"" he said.  PDVSA would supply associated gas to the Jose plant, in which it would also be a shareholder. The facility aimed to export mainly to the Caribbean and the United States, he said.  The Paria plant was designed to export LNG to the north-east United States, Spain and Portugal.  Marsicobetre said PDVSA Gas was seeking between $6 billion and $10 billion in private investment to develop the production of non-associated gas, its LNG projects and the Venezuelan gas grid.  Expanding non-associated gas and the gas grid would each absorb 30 percent of that total sum while the two LNG facilities would need some $2.6 million. The cost of developing oil and gas production in the delta platform was not included in that calculation, PDVSA Gas executive Nelson Mava told reporters.  ""If we move in a fast track we can have twice that investment,"" Mava said.  He said Venezuela, the world's seventh largest gas producer with proven reserves of 146 trillion cubic feet (tcf), was counting on the development of non-associated gas to meet rising domestic demand.  Venezuelan gas consumption was forecast to more than double by 2009, rising to 4.2 billion cubic feet a day from the current level of 1.8 billion. That meant the percentage of gas in the fuel mix would rise to 55 percent from 42, Mava said.  Of the current 142 tcf output, 132 tcf was associated and 14 non-associated. But there were unexplored reserves of non-associated gas of 6-20 tcf onshore and 40-60 offshore, he said.  ((Gillian Handyside.

The three customers will begin service agreements upon receipt of regulatory approvals.    The open season process for the proposed service began Feb. 16, with the new service providing 4.25 billion cubic feet of storage capacity and 750 million cubic feet per day of terminal and pipeline capacity to accommodate LNG imports by the three companies.    The open season agreements also provide for a 2.5 Bcf (vapor equivalent) storage capacity expansion of Cove Point's Lusby, Md. location.    Cove Point anticipates filing an application with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to provide the LNG tanker discharging service, to recommission Cove Point marine facilities and to construct new storage facilities including the new LNG storage.    Columbia Energy Group agreed to sell partnership interests in Cove Point LNG Limited Partnership to Williams Cos. (WMB) subsidiaries for $150 million.

"riday July 7, 11:43 am Eastern Time  Company Press Release  SOURCE: Columbia Gas Transmission  Columbia Gas Transmission Files Innovative Capacity Auction Process With FERC  FAIRFAX, Va., July 7 /PRNewswire/ -- Continuing its quest to promote creative  regulatory policies, Columbia Gas Transmission, a wholly owned subsidiary of Columbia Energy Group, has urged the Federal Energy Regulatory  Commission to consider an interactive, Internet-based pipeline capacity auction process that enhances Columbia's current open auction process.  In a first of its kind filing, Columbia proposes a ``bid/offer'' system for  selling capacity similar to on-line natural gas commodity trading systems.  The filing was made in response to customer concerns with the current process and is  consistent with sentiments expressed in FERC's Order 637, which encourages companies to voluntarily submit ``new and innovative approaches''  to capacity auctions. Since the filing is not required under Order 637, Columbia's proposed auction is separate from Columbia's Order 637 compliance  filing made June 15.  ``Under the current mechanism, capacity is not always awarded to the party  that places the highest value on it,'' said Carl Levander, vice-president of Rates and Regulatory Policy for Columbia Gas Transmission. ``Even though we  conduct our current capacity auction over a five-day period, parties often wait until the last 15 minutes to place a bid. Also, since the current  process is based on set time periods, customers often call us back after the  auction is closed saying they valued the capacity greater than the winning bid.''  According to Levander, Columbia's proposal addresses these concerns by moving  to an enhanced, Internet-based interactive auction that takes into consideration such current market conditions as daily fluctuations in  capacity value and the increased level of auction activity due to shorter-term contracts.  Under Columbia's proposed ``bid/offer'' system, Columbia would ``offer'' (via  its electronic bulletin board) sales terms for all its available firm  capacity. Customers can then match all asking sales terms for any portion of the  quantity and a sale is immediate and binding. If Columbia offers discounted capacity, the customer can counter-offer with a different rate. Or, if  Columbia offers maximum rate capacity, then a customer can counter-offer with  a different term length. Columbia can match the highest bid, subject to a  present value process, and the sale is immediate and binding. At any time  before a binding sale, the customer can change or withdraw its bid.  Columbia's ``bid/offer'' auction proposal meets the six basic principles  outlined in FERC's Order 637.       *     Columbia's auction has predictable timing since the auction will           begin each day at 9:15 a.m. (EST) and all available capacity will be           posted prior to 8:00 a.m. (EST).     *     The auction will be open to all creditworthy bidders on a non-           discriminatory basis.     *     The auction is user-friendly since it will use Columbia's existing           EBB format. All information concerning rules and procedures will be           made available on the Internet.     *     The method of selecting the best bid will be easily understood since           bidders will only be able to change one variable with respect to           each capacity package made available.     *     As is Columbia's current practice, winning bids and the bidder's           identity will be posted to permit monitoring of how the selection           criteria were applied.     *     The bidding process will be transparent to all parties since all           bids (without the bidder's identity) will be available for review to           all bidders through an Internet-based system.   ``We believe the combination of these factors will ensure that the capacity  auction format is 'transparent, verifiable, and non-discriminatory' to all  parties as well as innovative in design,'' Levander said.  Levander said the proposal not only meets the Commission's principles, it is  based on feedback gathered from customers, who expressed a desire for transparent market information; shorter auction periods; an ability to  withdraw and change bids; and a real-time, immediate closure process.  Columbia Gas Transmission, with offices in Charleston, W.Va., and Fairfax,  Va., moves an average of three billion cubic feet of natural gas per day to markets along a 12,550-mile pipeline network, which reaches across 10  Midwestern, Northeastern and mid-Atlantic states. The company operates one of the largest natural gas storage systems in the country with over 240  billion cubic feet (Bcf) of working capacity.  Columbia Energy Group, based in Herndon, Va., is one of the nation's leading  energy services companies, with assets of approximately $7 billion.

From:  ENA Office of the Chairman @ ENRON                            07/10/2000 05:50 PM    Sent by: Enron NA Office of the Chairman@ENRON To: ENA Employees cc:   Subject: ENA Meeting and Event Expenditure Approval Process   The approval process initiated in 1998 for all meeting and event expenditures  in excess of $5,000 has enabled ENA to better assess the business value of  events, accurately track our activities and save money.  These events include  customer and employee meetings, and trade shows.    ENA has made some modifications to the process, which are described in this  memo.  The $5,000 threshold remains in effect for all customer events.  However, the  threshold for approval for employee meetings and events has been lowered to  $2,000, and some additional requirements must be met prior to approval.  Please be sure to follow the procedures described below for all meetings and  events, so we can continue to successfully manage these events.  1) Prior to making any commitments to customers or vendors, all customer  events with anticipated costs in excess of $5,000, and all employee events  with anticipated costs in excess of $2,000 must be reviewed by the ENA Public  Relations (PR) department and approved by the ENA Office of the Chairman  2) The PR department will handle the site search and hotel contract  negotiations for all such events.  Once this is completed, the PR department  will work with you to plan and produce your event in its entirety; or they  can provide as much or as little assistance as you require. The PR department  will be responsible for helping you achieve the best value for your program  and ENA.  3) A completed expenditure request form (see attached) and supporting  documentation is required for each event.  Employee meetings require a  detailed agenda as part of the event documentation prior to approval.  Please  submit the completed expenditure request form and documentation to the PR  department at EB 3642, or work with PR department employees to complete the  form.  4) After PR review, the expenditure will be submitted to the ENA Office of  the Chairman for final approval.  Additionally, the PR department can assist in the procurement of tickets for  various local sporting events and concerts.  If you have any questions regarding this process, would like assistance  planning an event, or need tickets for a Houston event, please contact Dorie  Hitchcock in the PR department at (713) 853-6978.

Electricity: The predominance of electricity usage occurs in states that are either  several years away from enacting deregulation or where the rules are insufficiently  determined at this time to even estimate an opening date.  When opening dates are more clearly  defined and we have confidence in energy curves for those markets, then we could  revisit this area of your energy profile.   Natural Gas: Bunge has taken the initiative to engage in several longer term supply and  transporation  agreements which have effectively managed your price/therm.  For those  reasons, the  opportunities are very limited for Enron to apply a consolidation approach  and provide compelling additional value for Bunge.  As we agreed in January, the first objective was to define the potential for  mutual value and then decide what, if any next steps were appropriate.  I regret we will  not be able to help Bunge at this time, but know that Enron will remain interested in  assisting your company in the future if and when market conditions afford us that  opportunity.    Please feel free to contact me at any time in the future if I can help answer  further questions for you or others who have been involved in this process.  Dick, thank you  again for  providing your time and attention to this inquiry process.

Celeste Roberts, who handled many facets of  the Associate and Analyst Program will now focus primarily on Recruiting.  I  am responsible for staffing, rotation management, and performance management  reporting directly to Charlene Jackson.   Going forward, I will partner with  the PRC Representatives and Human Resources to work through our mid-year and  year-end performance management process.     There are just a few remaining tasks necessary in order to bring our mid-year  effort to a close.  As we are getting inquiries from Supervisors, Associates  and Analysts regarding mid year ratings, we strongly encourage you to  communicate final ratings to the Supervisors by no later than Friday, August  11, 2000.    As was discussed in the PRC meetings in July, Managers have been  given until September 15 to conduct performance reviews.    If you need our  assistance in communicating information to the Supervisors, please let me  know and we will provide ratings where requested on your behalf.  Additionally, as we introduced a new process during our mid year review  efforts, it is crucial that we solicit your feedback.   To assist in this  effort, we have identified an Associate and Analyst PRC Project Team.     Please look for an evaluation form via email in the next several weeks that  requests feedback on how well we delivered our mid year process and how we  might improve.  We our counting on your partnership and candid feedback.     Once again, the Associate and Analyst Program Management Team would like to  thank you for your involvement in the performance review process.  I can be  reached at 713-853-7351.  My assistant is Constance Charles and she can be  reached at 713-853-5614.  I look forward to working with each of you.

"A quick summary of the NYMEX meeting I attended on August 10.  1.   eNYMEX  NYMEX has begun developing an internet based trading system to  replace Access and to handle basis trading.    The system is targeted to launch some time during Q4  2000.   The basis  products that might be traded are    Nymex swap, AECO (C$/gj  fxd/float),  Transco Z6, Chicago City Gate, Houston Ship Channel.  2.  TAS   Overwhelming support of the TAS pilot program from trade players  with locals opposed.  A motion was passed to    add expiration day to the  current TAS pilot program.  The motion is to be presented to the NYMEX board  in the    next few weeks.      3. AGA data release Favorable comments regarding the 1pm release of the  weekly storage data.       4.  Sabine Hub discounts  Sabine is considering offering some discount  through the Hub for volume commitment.

Here are some details FYI:  Day-ahead on-peak call on either power or gas Power qty = 250 MW Power strike = $45/Mwh Gas qty = 30,666 mmBtu per day (16 on-peak hours), which results in an  implied heat rate of about 7667 mmbtu/GWh Gas strike is $5.90/mmBtu Gas is delivered to plant; they will assign their Algonquin gas capacity  rights which will allow secondary rights anywhere on the Algonquin G lateral Power firmness:  unit contingent with availability guarantee of not less than  95% Gas firmness:  secondary firm  Please get back to me ASAP with any comments or questions, including any  feedback on the degree of ""strategic fit"" this position would provide us.   Ed, I could especially use some gas expertise in scrubbing down the gas piece  and to make sure our gas curves are in the market (some miscellaneous  customer feedback I've gotten suggests our Northeast gas numbers are a bit  off).

(Tiverton  apparently has achieved full commercial status as of today)  I will be  pulling together a price today/tomorrow and was hoping to get back to them no  later than end of this week.  They are shopping this around to 4-5 entities  including us.  Here are some details FYI:  Day-ahead on-peak call on either power or gas Power qty = 250 MW Power strike = $45/Mwh Gas qty = 30,666 mmBtu per day (16 on-peak hours), which results in an  implied heat rate of about 7667 mmbtu/GWh Gas strike is $5.90/mmBtu Gas is delivered to plant; they will assign their Algonquin gas capacity  rights which will allow secondary rights anywhere on the Algonquin G lateral Power firmness:  unit contingent with availability guarantee of not less than  95% Gas firmness:  secondary firm  Please get back to me ASAP with any comments or questions, including any  feedback on the degree of ""strategic fit"" this position would provide us.   Ed, I could especially use some gas expertise in scrubbing down the gas piece  and to make sure our gas curves are in the market (some miscellaneous  customer feedback I've gotten suggests our Northeast gas numbers are a bit  off).

According to Todd Peterson of Enron Global LNG, exploitation of this  opportunity has been the topic of some industry articles but no one, as far  as we know, has constructed such a vessel.    I did come across a proposed design for an LNG floating terminal by the  Italian company,Tecnomare.   I contacted them and they indicated that  they  have not built such a vessel.  It is estimated that construction of such a vessel  would take 2-3 years, and as one might imagine, achieving the required  operational and  environmental performance in such a vessel would be quite substantial.   Attached is a link to a relatively brief description of the proposed vessel, http://www.tecnomare.it/marine/project/ling.htm  Please let me know if any further research is needed.

The problems started at 8:30 PM when  one of the 500 kV lines from the Comahue region went down. Around 10:30 PM, 2  other lines went down as well, all in the Comahue-BsAs corridor. All 3  incidents were due to sabotage acts, in which the tensiles holding the high  tension towers were sawed. In addition to the transmission lines sabotage, at 10:00 PM, one of the  Nuclear plants suffered technical problems and kicked out 640 MW. This situation created a huge swing in the frequency of the system and an  overload of the 4th line from Comahue, which finally went out of service as  well at 1:30 am, and was out of service for 1 hour. This last event kicked  out the exports to Brazil which were at 1040 MW.  As a result of all the above power prices reached $170 per MWh during 11:00  PM. Transmission lines are expected to be re-established by Saturday.  For who might be interested, below is a detailed document and map showing the  sequence of incidents and the damages caused (in Spanish).

(""DTI"") and its customers  (and interested state commissions) continued to meet to discuss DTI's  upcoming TCRA filing to be submitted to FERC on September 29, 2000.  The  customers had numerous questions for DTI about why its upcoming TCRA filing  will result in such a large rate increase, and advised DTI that it needed to  provide more information to the customers before they could make a meaningful  response to DTI's settlement proposal made on September 15, 2000.  DTI opened the meeting by defending its upcoming TCRA filing as prudent, in  accordance with FERC's prior orders on its TCRA mechanism, and legally  defensible.  DTI then asked for responses to its settlement proposal made  last week.  The basic feedback was that the customers ""were not there yet.""   The customers said they were still interested in discussing settlement (in an  effort to reduce the impact of the upcoming TCRA filing), but they wanted  more of an explanation from DTI of its proposed substantial rate increase.  Much of the customer's questioning focused on DTI's ""non-purchased"" fuel  supply (i.e., fuel gas DTI has borrowed from storage) and the continued  growth in this element of its fuel supply mix over the past few years.  As of  June 30, 2000, DTI has borrowed approximately 23 Bcf from storage for fuel  use.  DTI also revealed that it had ""liberated"" approximately 13 Bcf of base  storage gas over the last several years (i.e., reclassified base storage gas  into working gas), and that this gas was ""still on the system.""  DTI said it  had a $0.31 per MMBtu basis in this gas and that it was hoping to save it for  a future storage project.   The liberated gas had not yet been reflected by  DTI in its FERC reports or accounts.  Arguably, this gas has been parked in  space being paid for by the customers and the customers are paying DTI a  return on this gas.  During the bulk of the meeting the customers asked questions and DTI answered  them.  DTI volunteered little; most information had to be extracted from its  representatives.  The feeling of many of the customers was that DTI was not  being forthright.  At the conclusion of the meeting, the customers said they wanted to ask more  questions and would present DTI with their questions in the near future.   Only after they have a better sense of the facts would the customers  seriously entertain settlement offers.  Some customers expressed a desire for  DTI to terminate its TCRA mechanism.  The customers also said the TCRA  problems need to be addressed permanently so that there is not a ""TCRA  crisis"" every year.  Accordingly, DTI will make its TCRA filing on September 29, 2000 seeking a  cost increase of approximately $65 million.  It appears that the customers  will protest the filing and await FERC action on the filing and protests.  In  the meantime, another meeting to discuss these matters has been tentatively  set for October 18, 2000 at 9:30 a.m. in Washington.  The meeting may be  cancelled if the parties do not believe it would be useful to help resolve  the issues at that time.  Please contact us if you have any questions about this matter.

This is what Alagasco  shows we have regarding contract numbers and expiration dates:  There are four  old CES/ Bring cotracts which have been assigned over to  ENA.  They are:  Bring reference number   #10170, volume of 20471 expires 12/31/00  (has  associated demand fees)     Alagasco ref # --  ENA No. 2,  Sitara #-250042 Bring Reference number  #10055, volume of 10000 expires 11/30/00 (has  associated demand fees)      Alagasco ref # -- ENA No. 1,   Sitare #-250050  These are the only  two contract Alagasco wants to terminatein accordance  with the expiration date.   In additon we have two other old Bring/CES  contracts that have expiration dates in 2001 and 2002 that  they have no  intention of  terminating, unless however ENA would allow them to which we  would not since they have demand fees with escalators associated with them.    They are:  Bring reference number #10219, volume of  5339, expires 10/31/01  (has  associated demand fees)     Algasco ref # -- ENA No. 3, Sitare #250196         Please note that in the system we have the termination date is  correct but the volume is incorrect.  It reflects 10,000 and you can see that  the date ranges have been split  each monthby  Joe Casas, whom  changes the  volume in the scheduled section to 6,045 to account for fuel and what  Alagasco is actually taking.  This needs to be corrected.     .Again,  Alagasco has no intention of terminating this contract.  Bring reference number #10326,  volume of 10,000 during the winter only,  months Nov - March , (has associated demand fees)  Algasco ref # -- ENA No.4 This deals expires October 31, 2002.  Sitara # --250186       This is the  contract that allows Alagasco swing rights in which they have yet to  exercise.  AT one point Scott Neal had mentioned to try to work on taking this swing  language out of the contract but I have not mentioned anything to them since  they have yet to exercise  those swing rights and I did not want to bring it  to there attention.    I do not know how much the demand fees are on this  cotnract , but I would assume they are signficant.  Alagasco has sent  two termination letters to cancel the first two above  contracts, only.  i.e.-- Bring ref #'s  10170 & 10055.    ENA does reflect  these properly in the system so I believe we should be able to terminate  these contracts.   The other two contracts have nothing to do with the two  termination letters Alagasco sent us.   In additon, the two seasonal  contracts that were done in Apirl & May 00  between Roger and myself, Sitara  deals 242653 & 271301; Algasco  would like to tie these contracts  to the  newly signed Enron Portfolio Master Firm Contract   wlhich I also agree with.  All deals look accurate in Sitara regarding term and volume except for Sitare  # 250196, which I mentioned above.  I do not know the demand fees associated  with the contracts so I do not know if they are in the system accurately or  if they are being billed accurately.  Cindy, I think this information should be everything we need to clear up the  confusion regarding Alagasco's pending terminaiton letter.    Please get with  me once you have a minute.    Thank you.

Basically, Gary needs to know ASAP whether we  have changed our stance on partial day capacity releases.  In the past, we  have been against partial day recalls of capacity; however, with the growing  need for on peak, off peak service, have we changed our stance?  There are  obviously pros and cons to both approaches--we just need to agree on what we  want our official stance to be.

I have only  researched the requests that have to do with Recall, Right to do Partial day  Releases and Partial Day Recall.  As you know, these have  been added to a Two day BPS meeting in Colorado  Springs next week (OCT 10 & 11),  which I will be attending. At the last EC  meeting the LDC's wanted this issue sent to FERC, By GISB, as an issue that  needs further clarity from FERC before standards can be structured. The EC  asked for guidance from the members and it was suggested by the EC members to  send this issue back to the BPS committee for further discussion, with a  commitment from the LDC's to have parties in attendance. Then BPS was to  present a report, on progress, to the EC at the OCT 13th meeting.  In my report I have Questions that are asking for guidance from management of  any changes to our historical policy on Capacity Release and GISB standards.

Your stats are as  follows:  EAST GAS TRADING (Bbtu/Day - Settled Sales Only)  Year to Year September 2000 7,258 September 1999 3,179 Increase  128%  Quarter to Quarter 3Q 2000  7,282 3Q 1999  2,910 Increase  150%  If you could send me an explanation explaining what's driving your increase  by tomorrow morning, that would be great.

ELECTRIC POWER  PART  ONE PEAK  TRENDS It is  noteworthy how  rapidly volatility can change geographically in the  electric  markets.  Last  year  the U.S. Midwest/South areas   were  the  peakiest,  but   it reversed  this year  with  the  West  being highest  at  the peaks  and in New England --  but only   in early May 2000 were  hgih  peaks  apparent  there.  Demand  can vary from half the peak max  to the max.  Peakers  can be on the  margin on the upper half of the supply mix in many markets.  We need to  watch  gas prices  this  winter  as they can effect  winter peak power  prices--not  just a  summer phenomenon.  Where  are  the most gas plants  now on the margin?  Ercot, FRCC, Neepool,  NYPP, SERC, WSCC  A  DISCONNECT There  is  a disconnect  in the on-peak forward market price for power in  Texas now; with the  added  5 GW  Texas forward markets  do not seem to    take this  into account yet.  (Note:  Vince Kaminski) The  Texas forward   market  should be  very soft  next summer  unless  we return to  105 degree  F  temperatures.    New England  is  just one year behind  Texas  in its  overbuild.  One main  reason for the  spikes  in Calif  is   power plants  did not  get   built in Calif   due  to  a lack of  a capacity  charge ..and  this is not a  panacea...as Calif also  has  many  enviro/siting  hurdles  that challenge   developers  who want to site as well.      .  TSUNAMI OF  MERCHANT  CAPACITY PLANNED? CERA   sees  over  240,000  MW  of planned  capacity over  the  2000-2005  period;  with   25,000 MW  being  completed  in  2000;  35 MW under  construction  for   2001 and 15 000 MW under  construction for   2002--  but   the market  only needing   13 000  to  15 000 MW  a year.   This   shall   lead  to  many  and large deferrals and  delays, especially in  2001  and  2002.  What  has  been the recent  history?   US  wide  over the past  3 years  just  11 percent of the planned  capacity  was  actually  finished  and   18 percent  of that planned  was  actually  under  construction.  They  assume  a  24 month  construction completion  time.  FOR PROFIT  TRANSMISSION Cera   sees  Allegheny Energy  in PJM West;  Entergy in SPP;  Southern  in  SERC  and Alliant  in MAPP  as all for profit transcos. TYPICAL   O&M COSTS  IN U.S.  TRANSCOS  Why  do  O&M  costs   differ  widely  among  transcos?  Some  costs  are  3   to 8 times higher  than the norm  at  $5000 in O&M expense  per 5000  system  miles  in size.  Regulatory   overhang  allows  this...this is  weather  adjusted  to remove  high  costs   from  big  freezes  etc.  USING REAL OPTION MODEL  VS  POWER PLANT  NPV You  want to  try to have  the base value of  an asset  going  forward  when  you expect volatility  and include  historical  spreads  and  fuel/power   price  swing  assumptions.  CALIFORNIA  MARKET IS BROKEN This market  starts  to  work  only after it   gets into  a reliability  crisis.  No incentives  to add power  plant  capacity  and huge hurdles   against  siting   even when the market  signals the  need is   there.  Will the  regulator's post 2000  fix  make it  worse?  PEAK POWER  DEMAND  FORECAST As  percent  per year  change  vs   2000  Cera  sees   2001  as follows: New Eng  / New York 6.3 /  6.2  percent PJM / ECAR   7.7 / 4.4 percent MAIN /  MAPP    3.0 /   -0.1 SERC /  FRCC   1.3 /  2.3  percent SPP /  ERCOT    4.0  /  2.3 NWPP /  Rockies     -6.8  /  -0.6 AZNM /  Calif-SoNV   -0.9   /   4.0 USA  avg    up  2.6  percent   It  looks  like Calif. in in for a   touch  summer  in 2001  as well.   NATURAL  GAS  PART   TWO SUPPLY  SHORT Year   2001  supply  rebound could  be  800mmcfd   to 1.0  bcfd;  Canada   in  2001  up only  400  a  day; in the US  we  need   2  bcfd  more supply  for   2001  demand.  alone  let alone  storage   refill.... yet  a cold winter  now  could   add   3  to 4  bcfd  to demand  and slash   storages.  The  fall in drilling  in 1999  and early  2000  took   3.5  bcfd  productive  capacity out of the  supply pool.  It  will  take  till  2005   for US production to  reach a 4.1 bcfd  gain versus  today's production.  ADDED  GAS  FOR POWER PLANTS Right now  Cera  expects  an incremental  need for   1  bcfd  next year for  these plants..this will  keep prices  high  MUCH MORE POWER SWING 1990 to 1992  we needed   5  bcfd  for power plant  swings;   now  we need    10  bcfd;  offpeak use is  even up  5  bcfd vs  10 years  ago.  RESI  USE  IS UP The  AGA  disco members   adds   750 000 new gas   homes  each year  and  this  builds  demand  year   round.  INDUSTRIAL   NUG  DEMAND Of  the   24  bcfd ( 8.77 Tcf) industrials  gas use  in the US;     8.6   bcfd   (  3.1  Tcf) of this  is for  power plant  and non-mfg  use.  HOW  FAST  CAN CANADA  ADD? Canada  can add   3.6  bcfd   by  2005   versus  now;   adding  each year  from  2001 to 2005 as follows:  500/800/900/700/700  mcfd annually.  IS  ARCTIC  GAS  ON THE HORIZON? Its  is  far away;   maybe   4  or  5  bcfd  by  2015..  This  means  up  to   2.7  bcfd  to  flow  to Midwest  by 2015  and up  to  2.4  bcfd  to  Calif./PNW   on expansions  by  2015.

From mid-September through early October it appeared that a lucky combinati= on=20 of mild weather, storage injections above 10 billion cubic feet (Bcf) per day,= =20 and a lack of storms in producing areas of the Gulf of Mexico had calmed the market somewhat. Henry Hub prices settled near $5.00 in the cash market, less than= =20 $0.20 above residual fuel oil. Last week, however, tragedy in the Middle East and=  a=20 slightly lower-than-expected storage injection report were sufficient to drive Novem= ber Henry Hub prices up by more than $0.50 in two days, to above $5.60.  Mild weather may still soften prices from current levels, but CERA does not= =20 expect the relative calm of late September and early October to return to the gas= =20 market. Turmoil in the oil market has raised the floor for gas prices, as nearly 1.= 5=20 Bcf per day of potential gas demand now burning residual fuel oil would quickly return = to=20 the gas market should prices decline relative to oil. Also, weather must remain mil= d=20 through October, or else US working storage inventories may not reach even 2.7=20 trillion cubic feet (Tcf) by the end of the month. The headroom for price is much=20 greater, as distillate oil, the next substitute for gas should gas prices rise, is itse= lf=20 in short supply. Shutdowns of industrial facilities represent an important increment=  of demand resistance as gas prices rise, and neither switching to distillate n= or=20 shutting down production comes easily or cheaply.  Time is running out before the heating season begins, and the market remain= s justifiably on edge: upward volatility remains much more likely than any=20 significant settling in price. As a result, CERA expects natural gas prices to be=20 sustained in the mid-$5.00s, averaging $5.50 at the Henry Hub during November (see Table 1).= =20 More luck--a great deal more--would be required to restore a measure of calm to= =20 the gas market.  Gas Storage--The Final Push October storage injections have varied historically from 4.0 Bcf to=20 approximately 8.5 Bcf per day in the United States, and this year CERA expects them to averag= e=20 5.5 Bcf per day, a moderate level for the month (see Table 2). The reporting of= =20 injections of 62 Bcf during the week ending October 6 precipitated a $0.37 increase in= =20 futures prices, but this rate is actually above average for the first full week of= =20 October. With the beginning of consistent heating load late this month CERA expects a=20 slowing of injections, resulting in an end-of-October inventory of 2,707 Bcf--more tha= n=20 100 Bcf below the previous record low for the end of October.  CERA expects that many storage holders--having begun the winter with record= =20 low inventories--will preserve inventories to the extent possible during Novemb= er. However, normal weather this year would drive a substantial rebound in=20 heating load from last year=01,s level and would require added storage withdrawals, whic= h CERA estimates will average 5.0 Bcf per day this year. Withdrawals at that pace,= =20 or even substantially slower (as occurred during 1998 and 1999), will keep=20 inventories on a trajectory to hit record lows by the end of March. Low storage inventories= =20 will remain a major source of price support, requiring that demand continue to b= e=20 priced out of the gas market, and keeping gas prices above those of residual fuel= =20 oil. Regional Markets-Winter Rules  The transition to winter pricing relationships is under way, and the start = of=20 winter heating demand in the West has narrowed differentials between the supply-ri= ch Rocky Mountains and the Henry Hub. Local demand for Rockies supply has also eased pressure on San Juan Basin prices, and CERA expects differentials=20 between both regions and the Henry Hub to continue to narrow through November. In t= he Northeast differentials will begin to widen with the onset of winter, with = the magnitude of the differentials depending on early winter weather. The onset= =20 of flows on Alliance will limit increases in the Chicago differential during Novembe= r=20 (see Table 3).  CERA=01,=01,s outlook by region follows:  * Rockies. Early-season cold has narrowed Rockies to Henry Hub differentials so far this month. Ample supplies within the Rockies will mean volatile pricing relationships through the end of October and early November depending on heating load, but in general strong regional demand will keep differentials well below the ($1.00) per MMBtu summer level. CERA expects a ($0.45) per MMBtu differential to the Henry Hub during November.  * San Juan. The increase in local heating demand in the Rockies will continue to ease pressure on San Juan prices by limiting flows south out of the Rockies. San Juan differentials should follow the same relationships as Rockies prices, with general narrowing but continued volatility through November. CERA expects an average San Juan differential of ($0.38) per MMBtu for November.  * Permian and Mid-Continent. Tight relationships between the Permian Basin and Mid-Continent and the Henry Hub should continue through November, with some slight widening in the Mid-Continent basis differential expected when Alliance flows commence. CERA expects differentials of ($0.11) per MMBtu and ($0.08) per MMBtu, respectively.  * Chicago. The beginning of service via the Alliance Pipeline during November is the focus of most attention in the Chicago citygate market. However, the demand rebound that would result from normal November weather this year would offset most of the added supplies. As a result, Chicago differentials will average in the $0.08-$0.20 per MMBtu range even when Alliance flows commence, although delay of the Vector Pipeline will keep much of the new gas in the Midwest. CERA expects average November Chicago differentials of $0.13 per MMBtu.  * Northeast markets. Normal weather would drive a substantial rebound in New York citygate prices from year-earlier levels, but there is little added delivery capacity into that market. CERA expects New York to price $0.66 above the Henry Hub during November, well above the current low o mid-$0.30s.  Canadian Markets--Supply Growth Still Uncertain The supply build is uncertain at this time because flows on Alliance are=20 uncertain. A line pack of between 5 and 6 Bcf has been established, and modest flows of= =20 200-300 million cubic feet (MMcf) per day have been initiated to test and commissio= n=20 the pipeline. The start-up is still slated for November 1, but the unknown=20 quantities of gas that are flowing on a day-to-day basis are making it difficult to asses= s=20 precisely the volume of supply being produced. At this time, it appears that October = is=20 on par with 1999. The current expectation is for over 15,500 well completions in= =20 2000, approximately 8,500 of which are expected to be gas wells. Even if the=20 shallow trend does not change substantially, the sheer number of wells is still expected = to=20 produce a supply build by year-end and into 2001. For 2000, the total western suppl= y=20 build is expected to be flat with 1999 to slightly negative, increasing to positive= =20 growth of 350 MMcf per day in 2001.  Demand Slow but Exports Up TransCanada flows are still down, averaging about 350 MMcf per day less in October than the year-earlier levels. Storage injections in the East have= =20 accelerated; eastern inventories are expected to be above last year=01,s levels at the e= nd of=20 October. Storage injections in the West, however, have dwindled, revising the expect= ed storage inventories to be even with the five-year average but below 1999=20 levels. PG&E GT-NW volumes have declined in October and are expected to be slightly below 1999 levels by 50-100 MMcf per day in November as well. Northern Bord= er Pipeline is running about 50 MMcf per day above October 1999 but is expecte= d=20 to be slightly below 1999 levels in November. Cooler-than-normal weather has push= ed western Canadian demand up slightly but does not offset the lower eastern= =20 Canadian demand.  High Prices, Wide Differentials The AECO-Henry differential has leveled off in the upper US$0.50s to low US$0.60s and is expected to remain in that range through the balance of=20 October. For November the differential is expected to average US$0.50, for a resulti= ng=20 AECO average of C$6.97 per gigajoule (US$5.00 per MMBtu).  **end**  Follow URL for PDF version of this Monthly Briefing with associated tables.  ********************************************************* CERA's Autumn 2000 Roundtable event dates and agendas are now available at= =20 http://www.cera.com/event *********************************************************    ********************************************************************** Account Changes To edit your personal account information, including your e-mail address, etc. go to: http://eprofile.cera.com/cfm/edit/account.cfm  This electronic message and attachments, if any, contain information from Cambridge Energy Research Associates, Inc.

The cost is based on the  number of users and reports, for example if we signed up 3 users for 6 months  the cost would be approximately $3,000.

"I enjoyed visiting with you as well.  I was very impressed with the students  that I interviewed.  You guys are certainly doing a great job educating.    I had the pleasure of visiting with Milagros and was very impressed with her  and I agree with your comments.   Some of the students were interested in additional reading that I thought  might be helpful to them.  2 books that I think are very good  are 1) Option  Volatility and Pricing by Sheldon Natenberg.  This is textbook type reading  that is the best book on options that I know.  2) Reminisences of A Stock  Operator by  Edwin Lefevre.  This is the best book on trading that I have  read (I am actually currently reading it for the fifith of sixth time).  It  is an easy read and is the real lfe story of a trader in the early 1900's.  A  must read for anyone who has interest in markets and trading.

Input from professionals such as yourself helps us to make our classes more relevant and offer better advice to our students.  We appreciate that you are willing to take the time to make this valuable contribution.  One of my former students, Milagros Daetz, dropped by to see met later in the day to tell me about her Enron interviews.  Milagros was very excited about Enron and impressed with all of the people she had met.  I want to offer an unsolicited recommendation on her behalf.  Milagros is one of the most impressive students I have ever taught.  While her GPA (3.9) is sufficient to certify her academic record, I wanted to comment on her intangible qualities.  Milagros is mentally tough, hard working, determined, and ambitious.  Just as important, she is a genuinely nice person.  She deals with people very well and possesses what I would describe as quiet leadership characteristics.  In other words,  she leads by example and by reason.  I also find her to be mature beyond her age and willing to assume responsibility for her own choices.  In short, I think Milagros would be an asset to any organization.  Again,  it was good meeting you.  Please fell free to contact me if I can help you in any way.  Regards,  Chip Ryan Assistant Professor of Finance E. J.

"---------------------- Forwarded by Scott Neal/HOU/ECT on 11/20/2000 12:09 PM  ---------------------------   ""scott neal"" <sneal12@mindspring.com> on 11/18/2000 01:30:30 PM To: <sneal@enron.com> cc:   Subject: wall st. journal article      California Power Plants Get Jolt As Natural-Gas Supplies Are  Cut  By Rebecca Smith Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal    LOS ANGELES -- Southern California power plants, already stressed to their   limits last summer, got another jolt this week as a cold snap caused a sharp   curtailment of supplies of natural gas used to generate electricity.   The power plants were able to switch to burning oil and continue to produce   electricity. But the unusual curtailment of natural gas underlines concerns  that  an increased reliance on gas for power generation across the U.S. is  putting the  reliability of the nation's electricity supply at risk.   That's because virtually all power plants now under construction in the U.S.   burn gas and only gas. The units affected this week in San Diego were able  to  shift to oil only because they were older plants that originally were   constructed to burn oil. Generators have been reluctant to add a dual-fuel   flexibility to plants in recent years because oil is far more polluting than  gas  and generally has been costlier.   In California, where gas-supply problems first surfaced on Monday in San   Diego, there is pessimism about a Hydra-like energy crisis that seems to  grow  new heads every day. The state weathered three-dozen electrical  emergencies last  summer, caused by a shortage of electricity. Officials had  hoped to solve the  problem by speeding up construction of new generating  plants. Now, they're  finding the state may be building its way out of an  electrical problem and into  a gas problem.   One official, who has been warning of the danger of reliance on a single   fuel, said this week's disruption pointed out the necessity of developing a   comprehensive energy policy that recognizes how changes in usage of oil, gas  and  electricity affect each other. ""We don't just need new generating plants  and  transmission lines, we may need pipelines, too,"" said Terry Winter,  chief  executive officer of the California Independent System Operator, the   organization responsible for maintaining adequate electricity supplies. ""You   can't look at these things in isolation.""   The natural-gas problems surfaced when the local gas-distribution company,   San Diego Gas & Electric Co., notified power-plant operators and a handful   of industrial users that it would be restricting their gas use by about half.  In  California, residential and small businesses have first crack at natural  gas,  and industrial uses are regarded as secondary, even if they are  generating  plants. Dynegy Inc., the Houston-based energy concern that owns   some of the older plants that serve San Diego, immediately switched to oil.  But  it didn't like doing so; its plants create three times as much pollution  when  they burn oil and exhaust valuable air-pollution emission credits that  power  plants here need to operate.   The San Diego units couldn't simply be shut down, because the state was  short  of power. Roughly 30% of the state's capacity already was off-line,  including  many of its nuclear units, as most of those plants are now  undergoing repair  after being run at capacity limits throughout the summer.   What's more, the gas-pipeline system that feeds San Diego isn't big enough  to  begin with. The system was built primarily to serve residential customers  and  not big power plants.   The problems could persist, off and on, through the winter. That's because   gas-storage levels are down sharply from a year ago throughout the nation,  but  especially in California, because it ran its gas-fired units so hard  last  summer. This time last year, Southern California had 87 billion cubic  feet of  gas in storage. Now, it's roughly 50 billion cubic feet, or 43%  less. Prices  also have moved up sharply, from roughly $2.50 a million  British thermal units  to around $8 this week. Nationally, storage levels are  down about 8% from a year  ago.   ""Gas is trading higher in California than anywhere else in the nation,"" said   John Lavorato, chief operating officer of Enron North America, a unit of  Enron Corp. of Houston. But he said they're headed up  in the Northeast,  based on cold weather forecast for the next 10 days to two  weeks.   High prices for fuel also push up prices for the end product, electricity.  In  California the average price for electricity to be delivered Thursday was  $228  per megawatt hour. That's double the price a week ago and five times  the price a  year earlier.

"1)  Is this deal done?  No, not yet.  Cabot is reviewing our new Enfolio long  term contract and has suggested some minor modifications.  Also, this new  long term contract form is awaiting final Legal Department approval - we  expect this imminently.  Finally, our reservoir engineers are scheduled to  visit Cabot's offices on 12/5/2000 to review their downhole data - we will  not enter into a long term contract until a full reserve review has been  completed.   2)  What is the firm quantity?   The quantitiy should be fixed.  For  December, the firm quantity on Tennessee is 11,280 Mmbtu/d, or 80% of the  14,100 Mmbtu/d we expect to flow.  The firm quantity on Transco is 14,720  Mmbtu/d, or 80% of the 18,400 Mmbtu/d we expect to flow.  We intend to keep  the desk whole on these firm quantities. 3)  Who is communcating with Cabot from a logisitics/volume management point  of view?  We expect to communicate with Cabot from a logistics/volume  management point of view.  4)  Why are we nominating ( instead of ENA Upstream) and which group is  responsible for balancing on Tenn and Transco?  We intend to do whatever is  necessary to get the gas to pipeline pooling points and thereupon turn it  over to each Desk's logistics team.  We do not see the need to duplicate our  existing logistics function.

Zone 1    Victor,  Are you guys nominating/confirming this gas on Tennessee Passkey and Transco  Transit for December or are we?  We expect that as the deals are entered into  Sitara, you will be asked to nominate and confirm this gas.  Are there going to be two sets of tickets for each deal (one for the firm  volume and one for the swing)?  We'll need those deal numbers when you have  them..  Actually, we've prepared 3 deal tickets for each deal.  One ticket is  for the 80% firm purchase (first of the month index pricing) from Cabot by  Upstream, the second ticket is for the 20% spot purchase (gas daily pricing)  from Cabot by Upstream and the third ticket is the desk-to-desk transaction  in which Upstream sells the 80% firm volume to the East Desk - this is the  ticket which will generate origination to the Upstream Desk, if applicable.     Are you scheduling this internally in Unify or are we?  You are.   George x3-6992        Enron North America Corp.

Once you and John have had an opportunity to review  these tickets, Melissa and I would like to come down and walk them through  the system.  Thanks.  Cabot has agreed to do the December deals at index minus $0.01 for 80% of  their volume and gas daily minus $0.01 for the remaining 20% of their  volume.  We expect that they will soon execute the long term paper providing  for index minus $0.005 for the 80% firm traunch and gas daily minus $0.005  for the 20% spot traunch; a set of new long term tickets will be prepared and  submitted upon execution of the long term paper.  If this mechanism of documenting our deals works, we intend to submit all  future deals in a similar manner.

Her  initial rotation is scheduled to be in the structuring group with a follow-up  rotation in the back room.  However, she would like to do her initial  trading-track rotation in the middle-marketing group.  She would be  supporting the New York office (in Houston) where she would be assisting Per  Sekse and Carolyn Abramo, marketing to and executing on behalf of commodity  hedge funds.  I think this rotation would be very valuable in her  trading-track rotation.  After her rotation in this group, she would then  proceed with subsequent rotations as previously scheduled.  Since those of  you noted above had already agreed on the rotation schedule, John Lavorato  asked me to secure your agreement for this change.  He is agreeable provided  those of you noted are in agreement as well.  The middle-marketing group  would greatly welcome Mog and as I mentioned, I feel this rotation would be  very valuable to her as a potential trader in the future.  If I do not  receive an objection by Thursday, 5:00 P.M. - I will assume we can proceed  ahead.  Thanks for your cooperation.

"Thank you for the info.  I call if I have questions after I review further.        Enron North America Corp.    From:  Rebecca W Cantrell                           02/01/2001 05:53 PM    To: Scott Neal/HOU/ECT@ECT cc:   Subject: Tennessee Purchase of Physical Gas  Scott, this is all I could find about Tennessee's right to buy system gas.   There was nothing specific to fuel, and of course nothing at all about  financial transactions.  I don't read it to prohibit them from buying on a  forward basis, but they would probably be at risk if prices moved against  them too much.  Basically, Tennessee can buy or sell gas as required to balance and to  maintain system integrity.  And they can buy or sell it either (1) on a first  come/first served basis at posted prices, (2) through an auction or gas  trading system, or (3) through direct negotiations.  They no longer have a  fuel tracker.  Since they are supposed to be retaining fuel from their  transportation customers, they shouldn't be buying fuel, per se.    The Order 497 regulations deal only with information about transportation, so  Tennessee would not be required, absent a tariff provision, to post or report  its purchases from affiliates at the time it does them.  They do, however,  have to file a report of their cashout transactions, including any purchases  they make for balancing.  If one suspected they had overpaid their affiliate  for such gas purchases and it could be substantiated in the filing, the issue  could be raised in the cashout report proceeding at FERC.  Purchases made for  system integrity purposes, if not tied to cashout, would have to be addressed  in the next rate case.

Pursuant to this Section 7(g)(ii),  Transporter may  purchase gas                         quantities for receipt into its system and may sell  gas quantities for                         delivery out of its system.  These Operational  Transactions may be                         conducted on a first-come/first-served basis at  posted prices, or                         pursuant to an open auction or electronic gas trading  system, or                         negotiated directly with third parties.

"The guy in B.A. that we booked our hunt with is Emilio Paris (phone # 011 541  14 812 2154).  We hunted near a small town called Rio Tercero about  45  minutes outside of Cordoba.  We stayed at the Los Alamos Lodge.  Our guide's  name was Sergio Abrile.  We paid $750 for 3 days of hunting, 2 nights  lodging, meals, hunting license, etc.  We paid $9.00/box for shells.  We  aleady had our guns,  however they had very nice, new Beretta 12/20 ga.  shotguns for rent for $25/day.  We hunted April 30-May 2 which is the end of  fall and we slayed the birds.  I think the only time to avoid is during the  heart of winter July-August due to cold/wet conditions.  The flight from  Buenos Aires to Corboda cost about $200 and takes about an hour.  You might call Emilio just to compare prices, etc.  I think he is affiliated  with a US outfitter called Gage/4 Seasons.  I hope this info is helpful.

Pawpaw and I met with an outfitter last week to discuss details of a dove hunting trip in Argentina. In a nutshell, the trip includes six (6) shoots (i.e. half day hunts) near the town of Cordoba, Argentina. As Jody can attest, there is no limit and you can shoot 400 to 1000 birds per day depending on how mad you are at them!  I have estimated the total cost of the trip at $5,000. This price includes the following:  3 nights & 4 days (6 shoots) @ $2,295 (at Presidential Estancia) Roundtrip airfare (Houston-Miami-Buenos Aires-Cordoba) @ $1,000 (could be as low as $800) Shells ($9.75 per box) @ $1,000 (based on 320 birds per shoot...75% kill average) Gun permits, bird boys, entertainment in Buenos Aires, etc. @ $705  We need at least 4 to book a separate trip. Argentina's seasons are opposite from ours and the best time to go is August - October. A smaller group will be booked to go with an other group.  I know all of you boys got huge 2000 bonuses...so what's a paltry $5 large for a trip like this?  Let me know if you are interested in going with us so we can start looking at dates. If you have any questions call Pawpaw or myself. See ya.     ",lhanse@br-inc.com,scott.neal@enron.com,re: ARGENTINA DOVE HUNT,2001-02-14 09:20:00-08:00,sent

The basketball Gods have issued a technical foul to the Indian Guides by scheduling a late Friday night game for all the boys that had RSVP'd to go camping Friday night, so, here's Plan-B:  The official start-up time is now Saturday afternoon.  Let's plan on a caravan to the campsite from Butch Butcher's house.  Let's meet there around 2:00 pm.  If you can't leave at that time (earlier or later), information on the campsites are available at the park entrance under ""Wilchester Indian Guides/Butcher"".  Depending on the outcome of the game Friday night, an earlier caravan may be going Saturday morning.  Stay close to your phones.  As mentioned in earlier memo,  we will provide food for Saturday night ( hamburgers and fixin's for the boys).  If  Dads want something other than a burger, please feel free to bring a steak to throw on the grill.  We will also provide food for Sunday breakfast.  Please feel free to bring whatever snacks or drinks you want as well.  Remember to bring bikes, fishing stuff (optional), sporting goods, bug spray, camping stuff (I'm bringing an extra tent), cards, lottery tickets, ...  If you need help getting your bike to the park, call Butch (professional mover).  Oh yeah, Directions (if you miss the caravan):  From US-59, take Grand Parkway (TX-99)/Crabb River Rd exit and proceed South on Crabb River Rd.  Continue over RR tracks on TX-762 for about 15 miles and take left into Brazos Bend State Park entrance.  From Clear Lake area (who's coming from Clear Lake ?) take either FM-517 or FM-528 to TX-35.  Proceed to FM 1462 west.  Take a right on TX-762 and the Park entrance is about 1 mile on the right.  Yah-teh-hay!

"looks good to me.     Sean Boyle@ENRON 02/26/2001 05:36 PM To: Scott Neal/HOU/ECT@ECT cc:   Subject: Guaranteeing Index Minus Gas    Scott, I am talking to DTI (CNGT) regarding an Index minus sale for April-01  through  June-01 of up to 4 Bcf.   I wanted to send my contact a brief description of how we would go about  achieving an Index minus baseload price by imbedding an option.  I am not  supposed to know about DTI's potential purchase requirements, so I changed  the quantities and months in the example below, since the plan is to take  this to her boss. Please let me know if this sounds OK or give me pointers on making it better.  Tammi, As promised I wanted to send you a simplified example of how we can guarantee  you IF-FOM Index Gas you can take to Michelle.  Example:  Note: All prices are notional non-transactable numbers.   DTI requires a total of 610,000 DT in April and May as a 10,000 DT/d baseload  purchase.  ENA Proposal would guarantee DTI IF-FOM Index Minus Gas by embedding an  option (Put or Call) into the deal for say 5,000 DT/d. Therefore if DTI has the flexibility to take up to 915,000 DT (in the case of  the put) or as little as 305,000 DT (in the case of a call) then ENA can take  the value of the option and imbed that into the price of the gas.  Let us say; ENA is currently offered at IF - CNG App Index for  April and May  @ Index +2 cents, and agrees to sell DTI Index  -2 cents; ENA has lost 4  cents or $0.04 * 610,000 = $24,400. However, if we price in the value of a call option with a strike price of the  FOM Index, then that would generate $0.10 * 5,000 * 61 days= $30,500. ENA  would use this value to offset the Index loss and make a small margin on the  sale.  Therefore DTI is guaranteed Index minus gas, however must have the  flexibility to potentially take more or less gas than the baseload quantity.   Remember, if the option is out of the money for the entire period, DTI will  receive only the baseload quantity.  If ENA exercises the option everyday  then DTI will receive the quantities mentioned above still at a price of  Index -2 cents.  This can work if you need a quantity of gas over say four months we can imbed  the option in three of the months and buy or sell the remainder in the fourth  month at Index flat to achieve the desired quantity over the four month  period.  Obviously the more flexibility you give the more premium the option  will generate and hence the greater the discount to Index we can guarantee.   Please let me know if you have any questions.  If you would like me to do a  conference call with Michelle just let me know.

Review the dates on your products.   We are in the process of converting ""regular"" products to ""Tokenized  Reference Period"" Products.  A Tokenized Reference period product is one which the system sees as ""Day  Ahead"", ""Month Ahead"", ""Month Ahead +1"", etc - but this is not what you or  your customers see.   At midnight every night, the system checks the current  date and then CHANGES the dates shown on the Product Description.   For  example, if Product #20451 is ""Month+1"", then on Feb. 28, the Short  Description on the Website and in Stack Manager would show ""April1-30"".     However, on March 1, the system will automatically change the date of Product  #20451 to show ""May1-31"".  Note that the Product number stays the same, but  the date has automatically updated.  When all of your Products use Tokenized Reference Periods, this works fine -  your links all stay on the same relative date (links are between Product  Numbers, not between Product Short Descriptions, so as the date changes, it  might look like your links are changing, but in fact they have stayed on the  same Product all the time - only the date changed).  Believe it or not, changing to Tokenized Reference Periods will make your  life easier in the long run - you will not have to continually create new  Products and links. Links between Products which share the same dates should  continue in effect as the dates of both the Parent and Child change together.  The important thing to remember here is that for monthly Products which have  Rolling Tokenized Reference Periods, the dates will continue to change  automatically on the 1st day of each new month.     For example:  On Feb. 28, the ""Prompt Month"" product will be March; but on March 1, it will  become April, etc.   On Feb. 28, the ""Prompt +1 Month"" product will be April; but on March 1, it  will become May. etc.  To verify if your product has a Tokenized Reference Period or if it has a  specific date, please review your product in Product Manager under the 1st  tab marked ""Product Details.""   Your product will be ""Tokenized"" if it has  the following applications:  There will be a check mark  in the box after ""Lifespan Tokenized?"" The term ""Prompt Month"" or ""Prompt Month +1"" will be displayed in the next  scroll-down box.   If you have any questions about the set-up of your products, please contact  the following members of the EnronOnline Product Control Group: Rob Cass x 35491 Kevin Meredith   x 39555 Melba Lozano x 58986 Chris Walker x 37533 ",brad.mckay@enron.com,scott.neal@enron.com,NOTICE TO ALL ENRONONLINE TRADERS,2001-02-28 23:43:00-08:00,sent

"---------------------- Forwarded by Scott Neal/HOU/ECT on 03/07/2001 02:43 PM  ---------------------------      Enron North America Corp.    From:  Rebecca W Cantrell                           02/01/2001 05:53 PM    To: Scott Neal/HOU/ECT@ECT cc:   Subject: Tennessee Purchase of Physical Gas  Scott, this is all I could find about Tennessee's right to buy system gas.   There was nothing specific to fuel, and of course nothing at all about  financial transactions.  I don't read it to prohibit them from buying on a  forward basis, but they would probably be at risk if prices moved against  them too much.  Basically, Tennessee can buy or sell gas as required to balance and to  maintain system integrity.  And they can buy or sell it either (1) on a first  come/first served basis at posted prices, (2) through an auction or gas  trading system, or (3) through direct negotiations.  They no longer have a  fuel tracker.  Since they are supposed to be retaining fuel from their  transportation customers, they shouldn't be buying fuel, per se.    The Order 497 regulations deal only with information about transportation, so  Tennessee would not be required, absent a tariff provision, to post or report  its purchases from affiliates at the time it does them.  They do, however,  have to file a report of their cashout transactions, including any purchases  they make for balancing.  If one suspected they had overpaid their affiliate  for such gas purchases and it could be substantiated in the filing, the issue  could be raised in the cashout report proceeding at FERC.  Purchases made for  system integrity purposes, if not tied to cashout, would have to be addressed  in the next rate case.           Fifth Revised Sheet No. 209A                            Schedule LMS - MA                         Load Management Service - Market Area (continued)                           (ii)  Operational Transactions:  Operational Transactions  are those                         Operational Purchases and Operational Sales which  Transporter may from                         time to time, in its discretion, enter into with  third parties to                         balance Transporter's system and to maintain  operational integrity.                         Pursuant to this Section 7(g)(ii),  Transporter may  purchase gas                         quantities for receipt into its system and may sell  gas quantities for                         delivery out of its system.  These Operational  Transactions may be                         conducted on a first-come/first-served basis at  posted prices, or                         pursuant to an open auction or electronic gas trading  system, or                         negotiated directly with third parties.

(iii) Annual Cashout Report:  Transporter shall include in  the Cashout                         Reports filed pursuant to this Section 7(g) monthly  detail for Item                         Nos. 1, 4 and 5 as described in Section 7 (g)(i).

Triad     Scott and Tori:    I hope you are both doing well.  I have some questions for you about this  matter that will help me on a jurisdictional legal issue:     1.  Can we say that for each of the spot gas sales that you made to Triad,  Triad would have called you (or someone else with ENA) first, and that you  would have taken the call in Houston?  I am assuming that this is probably  the case, but I would like to get confirmation from each of you.    2.  Did Sherwood Purnell or anyone else from Triad ever come to Houston to  meet with either of you (or anyone else with ENA of whom you are aware)?   3.  Are there any other contacts between Triad and Texas that either of you  are aware of?   Many thanks for your usual quick response.   Britt   P.S. to Becky--I think you had some questions for Credit about how much is  owed.  Can you please flange that down today or tomorrow?  I want to get the  petition filed this week.

For those of us who  believe that as an unquestioned article of faith, let me  give you a little  history lesson. You'll see that it can get a lot worse  than this.  For our little history lesson we'll focus on the S&P 500, because that   pretty much represents the entire US equity market. Obviously the NASDAQ has  had  it a lot worse -- but that's only a subset of the total market, and it's  fairly  concentrated in a single broad sector: technology. In subsequent  commentaries  the NASDAQ will get its turn in the historical spotlight.  Over the last two quarters  the S&P 500 lost 19.23%. As horrific as that has  been, that actually only  ranks 78th out of the 2409 six-month periods since  1800. Believe it or not,  there have been 77 that were worse.  There were eight six-month  periods in which the S&P 500 lost more than 40%.  There were 18 in which it  lost more than 30%. The very worst single  six-month period was the one ending  May, 1932, in which the S&P 500 lost an  astonishing 52.92%.  Of the 77 six-month periods  worse than the most recent one, 21 were before  1900, and none of them were  during the Civil War. 33 (including the very  worst 4) were in the 1930s, in the  Great Depression that followed in the  wake of the stock market crash of 1929.    The worst six-month period  in the modern era ranks 13th overall. It was the  one ended September, 1974, with  the S&P down 32.39%. 4 others were in the  1970s.   The most recent period worse  than the last six months ranks 73rd. It was the  one ended March, 1988, with the  S&P down 19.56%. That means that in the  1990s there were no six-month  periods worse than the most recent six-month  period.   This shows that what we've experienced over the last six months is by no   means as bad as it could have been, or could still be. But at the same time  it  shows that market performance this bad is extremely rare. The S&P 500  has  done this badly (or worse) only 3.2% of the time over a span of 200  years. But  don't let any of that make you think it can't get worse.   It can. Of the 77 six-month periods worse than the most recent, the S&P  went  down further during the next six months 24 times -- losing an  average of an  additional 18.24%.   Okay, so the bad news is that, based on history, we've got about a 1/3  chance  of things still getting worse over the next six months. But of course  the good  news is that we've got, on the same basis, a 2/3 chance of things  getting  better.   But not that much better. Over the 53 times the S&P rose over the  next six  months, it only rose an average of 18.38%. Even if that happens now  over the  coming six months, that's not going to make up for the 19.23% loss of  the  last six months. And don't forget about the bad magic of compounding losses.   If you start with a dollar and you lose 19.23% of it, you've got 80.8 cents   left. It that then rises by 18.38%, you're only back up to 95.6 cents.   History class dismissed. Oh, and there will be a test tomorrow...

"Scott,  Please see the message below from Neil Davies.  Neil works in HR under David  Oxley and was instructed to call Mr. Reitze last night.  I asked him not to  mention the dinner with you.  A problem that is coming up is that the  interviews are required to run late (8:30ish) and the person that has been  pushed to the end of that line is Hunter.  What are your thoughts on this and  is him going to dinner with the two of you a possibility at all?  If you need  me to help with reservations or anything, please let me know as I would be  happy to help.  Also note that Greg Whalley would like to meet with him.  Eddie does not want  to come in any earlier than 4.  That can be a problem.  Maybe another thought  is to have him come in twice, but I am afraid if we pick that option, it may  be tough to get him back.

"Scott,  Please see the message below from Neil Davies.  Neil works in HR under David Oxley and was instructed to call Mr. Reitze last night.  I asked him not to mention the dinner with you.  A problem that is coming up is that the interviews are required to run late (8:30ish) and the person that has been pushed to the end of that line is Hunter.  What are your thoughts on this and is him going to dinner with the two of you a possibility at all?  If you need me to help with reservations or anything, please let me know as I would be happy to help.  Also note that Greg Whalley would like to meet with him.  Eddie does not want to come in any earlier than 4.  That can be a problem.  Maybe another thought is to have him come in twice, but I am afraid if we pick that option, it may be tough to get him back.  Anyway, look over this message, tell me your thoughts and after I hear back from you, I will arrange the interview schedule for Eddie on the 23rd.

Please let me know if you are available to deliver the same presentation you gave to Petrobras to PDVSA.  The time is 2:00 - 2:45 in 50MO3.  Objectives:  Favorably respond to a request from PDVSA to educate them about the natural gas industry  Impress PDVSA with Enron's professional staff and operations, i.e. Build familiarity and favorability of Enron  Background: PDVSA is Enron's key strategic partner in Venezuela.  For PDVSA, this visit represents a major opportunity for them to learn about the business of an industry that they are only now beginning to develop.  Until recently, PDVSA was limited to the petroleum until the new formation of their gas unit. PDVSA (Petroleum of Venezuela) is the largest and most important company in Venezuela.   It is one of the most important energy corporations in the world. It is a national corporation that establishes tight direct links with foreign energy companies as well as with the Minister of Energy and the government of Venezuela.   They are an enterprise that is multidisciplinary within the energy market.  It comprises in area of trade, refining, exploration and production.  (In particular: gas, emissions, petroleum, carbon, petrochemicals, lubricants, fertilizers, and combustion.) PDVSA is owner of many important companies like Citgo, Veba Oil, Refinery Isla, Borco, Bopec, and many others. Due to the importance of globalization within the energy market, there are many agreements with PDVSA and foreign companies.  PDVSA Relationship with Enron Venezuela  Enron Venezuela has two strategic partnerships with PDVSA.  PDVSA will supply natural gas to ACCROVEN, a $415 million natural gas extraction, fractionation, storage and refrigeration project with facilities in San Joaquin, Santa Barbara, and Jose that Enron recently constructed and will own and operate.  Enron is also developing a $700 million LNG project, which will include PDVSA as an equity partner and as the supplier of natural gas.  The final hurdle is authorization from the Venezuelan government that there are sufficient natural gas for the project.    Attendees: ANA KARINA SOLER - PDVSA GAS   Director, Commercial Development     OSCAR MONTENEGRO - PDVSA GAS  Superintendant, Contracts & Negotiations   CARLOS PEREZ - PDVSA GAS  Manager, Commercial Business     GONZALO ALVAREZ - INTESA Account Manager for PDVSA GAS.

Get Smart: Intelligent Order Routing and the Institutional Investor (Emerging Trading Technologies Client Access) http://www.meridien-research.com/doc.asp?docid=3D734 (Wholesale eFinancial Client Access) http://www.meridien-research.com/doc.asp?docid=3D735  Institutional investors, like their individual counterparts, want to get th= e best possible execution of their order. While some institutional investor= s have been improving their order management strategies and technology thro= ughout the 1990s, the buy side as a whole is only now realizing that it nee= ds to pay closer attention to how orders are treated to determine the true = operating costs of a mutual or pension fund. New technologies are emerging = that are helping them educate themselves and trade smarter. One such techno= logy, intelligent order routing, is a direct response to the emergence of m= ore-and more fragmented-marketplaces. Initially embraced by day traders tra= ding via direct access brokers, this technology is now making its way up th= e food chain. This report looks at various definitions of intelligence in o= rder routing, focusing in particular on institutional investors. At the end=  of the day, it is not so much about establishing a standard definition of = best execution as it is about making sure that the investing firm (or indiv= idual) feels that it has sufficient control of the order.   2. Connecting with Customers: CRM Touches Retail Broker/Dealers in the USA (Customer Interaction Client Access) http://www.meridien-research.com/doc.asp?docid=3D736 Many financial institutions are devoting considerable attention to figure o= ut how to serve the wealth management needs of individuals. We have noted a=  growing, almost feverish pitch among a rapidly expanding number of applica= tion and platform vendors that claim wealth management and/or investment ma= nagement as a solution focus. This brief examines the state of the retail i= nvestor marketplace in the United States, which represents the most logical=  view of the investment management opportunity. We conclude with our perspe= ctive of life cycle opportunities and technology solution capabilities that=  financial institutions should consider to remain effective competitors. A = related Customer Knowledge research brief, ""Analytical CRM: Understanding C= ustomer Needs, LTV, and Retail Broker/Dealer Business Models"" (Vol. 4, Brie= f 7, June 7, 2001), examines relevant analytical challenges and opportuniti= es.   3. Analytical CRM: Customer Needs, LTV, and Retail Broker/Dealer Business M= odels (Customer Knowledge Client Access) http://www.meridien-research.com/doc.asp?docid=3D737  Retail broker/dealers in the United States face a dilemma: as they strive t= o excel in the delivery of topnotch investment services, they must find eno= ugh retail investors of the right types. Our companion Customer Interaction=  research brief ""Connecting with Customers: CRM Touches Retail Broker/Deale= rs in the USA"" (Vol. 4, Brief 8, June 7, 2001) defines the retail investor = marketplace and the role of customer interaction technology solutions. In t= his brief, we examine business models and relevant analytical challenges an= d opportunities.   4. Wireless Payments at the Point of Sales: Expanding POSsibilities (e-Payments Client Access) http://www.meridien-research.com/doc.asp?docid=3D738 Financial institutions face a choice: they can participate in developing ne= w wireless payment technologies, or they can sit on the sidelines as others=  take the lead. If they don't get involved, they risk disintermediation by = entities like telcos that are not hesitating to jump into the driver's seat=  with wireless. This report examines the present state of wireless technolo= gy and the competing standards that are available today. It also looks at m= obile telecommunications firms and their motivations to promote wireless pa= yments. The report contains three case studies of wireless payments program= s: one a joint bank/telco initiative, one a bank initiative, and one a comp= any initiative.   **********************************************************   Meridien Research 2020 Commonwealth Avenue Newton, Massachusetts 02466 Tel: +1.617.796.2800 Fax: +1.617.796.2850 mailing@meridien-research.com  To be removed from our email distribution list, reply to this message with = the word REMOVE in the subject line.",scott.neal@enron.com,mailing@meridien-research.com,"POS Wireless Payments, Retail Broker/Dealer CRM, Analytical CRM,  POS Wireless Payments, Smart Order Routing - New at Meridien",2001-06-07 14:30:29-07:00,received

Natural Gas Intelligence is quoting a source that a force majeure could be declared by pipeline operators as a result of  ""confusion regarding accurate registration of nominations.""

Rail freight moving normally across Canada-US border. ? US-Mexico border reopen, but subject to delays and inspections on US side.  Mexican officials request that Mexican citizens delay trips to the US.   Political Update  International  US Arab allies (Egypt, Saudi, Jordan, Kuwait, UAE) walking a fine line.  Masses believe US got what it deserves, but leaders have to condemn attacks to maintain relations with Washington.  Moderate Arab leaders are concerned that support for attacks at home -- and possible US reactions to strike -- will increase instability and could lead to major upheaval in their countries.  Saudi sources expect ""state of confusion"" to exist for immediate period ahead.  In the West, no intelligence or law enforcement agency has anything concrete yet. Everything is therefore speculation, albeit logical speculation. Most importantly, the sophistication means someone bigger than bin Laden was involved, even if he was the final perpetrator.   Oil Politics  OPEC's Rodriguez has reassured oil markets on supplies, but no high-level Saudi officials have officially echoed this sentiment (nothing from Oil Minister Naimi).  Unofficially, we have reports that Saudi officials reporting that the terrorist incident ""relieves pressure on us to make anti-US moves"" in oil policy.",scott.neal@enron.com,k..allen@enron.com,FW: Competitive Analysis Update #4- US Terrorism Attacks,2001-09-12 06:17:02-07:00,received

Elvis Grbac , QB BAL - Tori Updated 10/16/01 Grbac was feeling = woozy and nursing a headache Monday, the result of the most severe concussi= on he's received in nine years in the NFL but he will play Sunday at Clevel= and. Grbac was slammed to the ground by Santana Dotson in the second quarte= r of the Baltimore Ravens' 31-23 loss to the Green Bay Packers on Sunday. T= he quarterback stayed in the game, but threw interceptions on his next two = drives and was pulled eight minutes into the fourth quarter. On Monday, Grb= ac declared himself fit enough ! to! play. ""I'm still a little foggy, and m= y wife was waking me up every few hours to see if I was alive,"" he said, ""b= ut I'm feeling OK and I'll be ready.""      Redskins , DT WAS - Free Agent U= pdated 10/16/01 Washington cornerback Fred Smoot suffered a sprained left k= nee during Monday's game against Dallas. He was on crutches after sustainin= g the injury and is currently listed as day-to-day.   Stephen Alexander , T= E WAS - Free Agent Updated 10/16/01 Alexander suffered a sprained right ank= le during Monday night's loss to Washington. He was seen using crutches on = the sidelines and is listed as day-to-day.   Duce Staley , RB PHI - Giggles=  Updated 10/16/01 According to Eagles' coach Andy Reid, Staley will be the = starting tailback on Monday night against the N.Y. Giants. However, Staley = is expected to split carries with Correll Buckhalter, which will make it to= ugh to play him Fantasy-wsie.   Joe Jurevicius , WR NYG - Free Agent Update= d 10/16/01 Jurevicius suffered a rib injury during Sunday's game against St= . Louis. The injury is not considered serious, however, so expect Jureviciu= s to be in the starting lineup on Monday against Philadelphia.   Bill Schro= eder , WR GB - Frank U! pdated 10/16/01 Schroeder (ankle) informed Head Coa= ch Mike Sherman that he would be available for Sunday's game against Minnes= ota. Sherman stated that a decision on Schroeder would not be made until la= ter in the week, but we expect him to go.   Joey Galloway , WR DAL - Giggle= s Updated 10/16/01 Galloway suffered a sprained left ankle during Monday ni= ght's 9-7 win over Washington. The Cowboys have a bye this week, so Gallowa= y should have amble time to recover from the injury in time for the team's = next game.    Reggie Swinton , WR DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/16/01 Swinton=  suffered a hamstring injury during pre-game warmups on Monday night. He le= ft the game after the opening kickoff, and is listed as day-to-day.   Jacki= e Harris , TE DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/16/01 Harris (groin) returned to = action on Monday night against Washington. He didn't have a reception in th= e game, and has no real value as a Fantasy player at this point.   Quincy C= arter , QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/16/01 Carter underwent successful su= rgery to repair the tendon that attaches his hamstring to his lower left le= g on Monday. He is expected to miss six weeks of action due to the procedur= e.    Raghib Ismail  , WR DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/16/01 Ismail (knee) r= eturned to action on Monday night against Washington. He finished with thre= e catches for 50 yards, but didn't make much of an impact Fantasy-wise.    = Tiki Barber , RB NYG - Neal/McKay Updated 10/16/01 Barber (hamstring) is ex= pected to return to practice on Thursday. Barring any setbacks, Barber will=  be available for Sunday's game against Philadelphia. With the emergence of=  Ron Dayne, however, Barber may see a drop in his Fantasy value over the co= ming weeks.   Michael Pittman , RB ARI -! M! atty Updated 10/16/01 Pittman = suffered a concussion during Sunday's loss to Chicago, and was dealing with=  headaches on Monday as a result. He is expected to undergo tests, and is s= tatus for Sunday's game against Kansas City will be determined later in the=  week. If he is unable to play, Thomas Jones would step into the No. 1 RB r= ole once again.   Randy Moss , WR MIN - Russell Updated 10/16/01 Moss is de= aling with a sprained right ankle, which may keep him from playing at full = capacity this weekend against Green Bay. It's tough to ever bench Moss, but=  considering his recent struggles, it might not be a bad idea if your roste= r allows for a solid replacement.   Doug Chapman , RB MIN - Free Agent Upda= ted 10/16/01 Chapman is expected to get the starting nod this weekend again= st Green Bay due to Michael Bennett's ankle injury. Chapman may be worth pi= cking up for the week in deeper leagues, but he'll be hard-pressed to put u= p good numbers against a solid Packers' defense.   Michael Bennett , RB MIN=  - Matty Updated 10/16/01 According to the Minneapolis Star-Tribune, Bennet= t (ankle) is expected to miss this weekend's game against Green Bay. He was=  wearing a protective boot on Monday and was walking with a noticeable limp= . Doug Chapman will likely get the start in Bennett's absence.

Fred Smoot (leg), however, is in danger of missin= g this weekend's contest against Carolina. Darrell Green would replace Smoo= t if he's unable to go.   Rob Moore , WR ARI - Martin Updated 10/17/01 Moor= e (hamstring) is listed as probable for Sunday's game against Kansas City. = He hasn't been full speed at practice, how! ev! er, so don't consider him F= antasy-wise just yet.   Patrick Jeffers , WR CAR - Free Agent Updated 10/17= /01 Jeffers (knees) saw extensive work in practice today and may be ready t= o play this weekend against New Orleans. However, Jeffers is too risky to s= tart from a Fantasy perspective.   Muhsin Muhammad , WR CAR - Martin Update= d 10/17/01 Muhammad's ribs are still sore after taking a few shots during S= unday's game against New Orleans. Coach George Seifert expects him to play,=  but he may be somewhat limited. Unless his status improves by the end of t= he week, Fantasy owners may want to consider benching Muhammad i! f ! at al= l possible.   Chris Weinke , QB CAR - Tori Updated 10/17/01 Weinke missed p= ractice on Wednesday due to a thigh injury. However, Head Coach George Seif= ert expects the rookie quarterback to start on Sunday against Washington. I= f you need a quarterback this week, Weinke is a good choice facing a terrib= le Redskins' defense.   Terance Mathis , WR ATL - Frank Updated 10/17/01 Ma= this (hand) returned to practice on Wednesday. He is expected to start on S= unday against New Orleans, but he's only worth starting in deeper leagues f= rom a Fantasy perspective.    Shawn Jefferson, WR ATL - Free Agent Updated = 10/17/01 Jefferson (toe) returned to practice on Wednesday. He is expected = to be in the starting lineup on Sunday against New Orleans, but he's too un= reliable to use Fantasy-wise.   Ryan Leaf , QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/= 17/01 Leaf worked with he first team offense during practice on Wednesday. = He was filling in for Anthony Wright, who was given the day off to rest his=  swollen right knee. Leaf will have his chance to win the starting job in D= allas, but he has no real Fantasy value at this time.   Troy Hambrick , RB = DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01 Now that Robert Thomas is gone for the ye= ar, Hambrick is expected to become Dallas' starting fullback. He's shown fl= ashes of brilliance at times, but his value as a Fantasy player is still mi= nimal at this point.   Michael Bennett , RB MIN - Matty Updated 10/17/01 Be= nnett is listed as doubtful for Sunday's game against Green Bay due to a ri= ght ankle injury. Expect Doug Chapman to get the start, with Travis Prentic= e serving as his backup. Don't use Bennett this week.  Randy Moss , WR MIN = - Russell Updated 10/17/01 Moss is listed as questionable for Sunday's game=  against Green Bay with a right ankle injury. While we normally tell you to=  start him every week, this is one matchup we wouldn't activate him for unl= ess it becomes completely clear he will start.  Shane Matthews , QB CHI - F= ree Agent Updated 10/17/01 The Bears re-signed Matthews on Tuesday. He retu= rns to his old backup QB job and isn't worth adding to your Fantasy roster.=   Terrell Davis , RB DEN - JWillie Updated 10/17/01 According to published = reports, Davis would like to return to the line! up! Sunday at San Diego. H= e has recovered from a knee injury, and Broncos Head Coach Mike Shanahan wa= nts him to return by November 4. We don't recommend you use Davis this week= , although this development also makes it tough to recommend you start any = Broncos running back.   Stacey Mack , RB JAC - Hunter Updated 10/17/01 Mack=  will get a lot of carries this week but don't expect him to be too product= ive. He only gained 17 yards on nine carries in the Jaguars' previous.   Ke= enan McCardell , WR JAC - Neal/McKay Updated 10/17/01 McCardell struggled i= n his first few games back from injury, but looked like his old self in the=  previous game. Look for McCardell to play well this week and catch a lot o= f passes.    Sean Dawkins , WR JAC - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01 Dawkins wi= ll have a tough time against Buffalo this week. He will catch of couple of = passes but won't find his way into the end zone.   Mark Brunell , QB JAC - = JWillie Updated 10/17/01 Brunell is no longer being bothered by headaches a= nd is expected to play in Week Six. Look for him to throw for over 200 yard= s and a score.     Kyle Brady , TE JAC - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01 Brady = is expected to play in this week's game despite a hip injury, and is listed=  as probable. H! e ! won't be too productive if he does play. Brady only ha= s five catches this season.   Jimmy Smith , WR JAC - Frank Updated 10/17/01=  Smith has been very consistent this season. Look for him to catch several = passes and score a touchdown against Buffalo.  Herman Moore , WR DET - Free=  Agent Updated 10/17/01 Moore will miss the remainder of the season after t= earing a muscle in his hip during Sunday's game at Minnesota. ""We're disapp= ointed the injury is much worse than we thought,"" Lions Head Coach Marty Mo= rnhinweg said. ""We believed it was a minor pull, but the MRI showed a signi= ficant tear in the muscle."" Drop Moore if he was on your Fantasy team.! L! = arry Foster assumes the No. 3 receiver job in Detroit.  Tyrone Wheatley , R= B OAK - Giggles Updated 10/17/01 According to published reports, Wheatley w= ill miss three to four weeks with a right knee sprain. The veteran back was=  beginning to lose carries to Charlie Garner before he was hurt.  Charlie G= arner , RB OAK - Russell Updated 10/17/01 The Contra-Costa Times points out=  Garner has apparently supplanted Tyrone Wheatley as the team's ""workhorse""=  back. The trend was apparent before Wheatley was reported to miss three to=  four weeks with a knee injury.  Travis Henry  , RB BUF - Martin Updated 10= /17/01 Henry told the Buffalo News he plans to have minor surgery on both k= nees after the season. Henry has tendinitis in both knees, but it will not = affect him during the regular season.  Jay Riemersma , TE BUF - Free Agent = Updated 10/17/01 The Buffalo News says the Bills want to get Riemersma more=  involved in the offense now that tackles Jonas Jennings and John Fina are = healthy again. Riemersma was being asked to block more often early in the y= ear, but he will now become more involved in the passing game.  Jerome Path= on , WR IND - Tori Updated 10/17/01 It is not clear if Pathon (foot) will b= e able to play this week against the Patriots. Pathon missed Sunday's game = against Oakland. Reggie Wayne would start in Pathon's place if he cannot pl= ay again.  Dedric Ward , WR MIA - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01 The Miami Her= ald says Ward had his foor placed in a boot because he had a problem with s= tress protection. The Dolphins do not know when he will return.  Emmitt Smi= th , RB DAL - Bass/Hull Updated 10/17/01 According to the Dallas Morning St= ar, Smith could end up splitting more carries with Troy Hambrick in the com= ing weeks. Head Coach Dave Campo believes the two backs complement each oth= er very well, and that the move will keep Smith fresh for a longer duration=  on game day.   Stephen Alexander , TE WAS - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01 Al= exander underwent an MRI on his injured right ankle Monday, which revealed = a high sprain. He is expected to miss at least two weeks of action due to t= he injury, so be sure to reserve him if he is still on your roster.   Micha= el Pittman , RB ARI - Matty Updated 10/17/01 Pittman, who suffered a concus= sion during Sunday's loss to Chicago, is expected to practice on Tuesday. H= is status for this weekend's game against Kansas City is questionable, but = he is expected to play.  Greg Clark , TE SF - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01 C= lark went through his most extensive workout since undergoing surgery on hi= s right hamstring three weeks ago. ""It was encouraging,"" Clark told the Con= tra Costa Times. ""I ran (a half mile). I never could do any of that before = the last surgery (which removed his semitendonosis tendon). The most I coul= d do was jog two minutes. It's an amazing difference in comparison."" Head C= oach Steve Mariucci doesn't know when Clark will be healthy enough to make = his season debut, however, but he did rule Clark out for their Oct. 28 game=  against Chicago.    More Updates  Player! N! ews Teams  [IMAGE]  Neal/McKa= y Player News  Keenan McCardell , Reserve WR Updated 10/17/01 McCardell str= uggled in his first few games back from injury, but looked like his old sel= f in the previous game. Look for McCardell to play well this week and catch=  a lot of passes.   Lamar Smith , Active RB Updated 10/16/01 Smith was in a=  walking boot after suffering a sprained ankle during Sunday's game against=  the Jets, according to the Miami Herald. He should be fine for Week Seven = when the Dolphins return from the bye week.  Tony Richardson , Reserve RB U= pdated 10/16/01 Chiefs Head Coach Dick Vermeil said Monday there is a chanc= e Richardson could play Sunday in Arizona, according to the Kansas City Sta= r. Richardson is battling a shoulder injury.  Tiki Barber , Reserve RB Upda= ted 10/16/01 Barber (hamstring) is expected to return to practice on Thursd= ay. Barring any setbacks, Barber will be available for Monday's game agains= t Philadelphia. With the emergence of Ron Dayne, however, Barber may see a = drop in his Fantasy value over the coming weeks.   Vinny Testaverde , Reser= ve QB Updated 10/14/01 Testaverde had a good outing against Miami, throwing=  for 168 yards and two touchdowns. He's still not worth starting ever week,=  but Testaverde is very useful Fantasy-wise when the matchup is right.   Ro= n Dayne , Reserve RB Updated 10/14/01 Dayne started on Sunday against St. L= ouis despite a neck injury. He rushed for 88 yards and a score in New York'= s 15-14 loss, and may be solidifying his grasp on the featured back role fo= r the G-Men.   Peyton Manning , Active QB Updated 10/12/01 Manning should t= hrow at least two TD passes against Oakland. The Raiders' secondary runs ho= t and cold, and sometimes has trouble with marquee quarterbacks.  Jerry Ric= e , Active WR Updated 10/12/01 Rice should have another good outing. He sho= uld draw inexperienced Indianapolis CB David Macklin in coverage, which mea= ns Rice will definitely be a TD threat again this week.  Freddie Jones , Ac= tive TE Updated 10/12/01 Jones has been a disappointment so far this year. = Don't count on good numbers from him this week, because the Chargers will f= eature the run against New England.  Mike Anderson , Active RB Updated 10/1= 2/01 Expect excellent numbers from Anderson this week. He always plays well=  against Seattle, and the Seahawks still lack the talent to stop him from g= aining big chunks of yardage as the game wears on.  Az-Zahir Hakim , Active=  WR Updated 09/08/01 Hakim might see a few passes thrown his way during the=  Rams' season opener Sunday in Philadelphia. However, his offensive potenti= al is limited as a No. 3 receiving threat, so his Fantasy ceiling isn't ver= y high.  Shawn Bryson , Reserve RB Updated 08/23/01 Bryson suffered a sprai= ned ankle during practice on Thursday. He was scheduled to have X-rays late= r in the day, but the team has diagnosed it as a simple sprain at this poin= t. Bryson, who will be a game-time decision for this weekend's game at Cinc= innati, is worth a later-round flier at best on Draft Day.   Broncos , Acti= ve DT Updated 08/23/01 Defensive tackle Chester McGlockton, who suffered a = slight ligament tear in his knee during Monday's preseason game, is expecte= d to be ready for the start of the regular season. Denver's defense has the=  talent to be a solid unit from a Fantasy perspective, and will be one of t= he top ten defenses taken on Draft Day.   Matt Stover , Active K Updated 12= /08/00 Stover needs just nine more field goals over the final three weeks o= f the season to break the NFL single-season record of 39 (Olindo Mare, 1999= ). Expect him to get plenty of chances against San Diego on Sunday, and ens= ure that he's in your active playoff lineup each week.

But the = Chiefs might depend on the run, so his numbers may be limited.  Ken Dilger = , TE IND - Free Agent Updated 10/18/01 Dilger is not a major factor in the = Indianapolis passing game anymore. Don't expect much from him against the u= nderrated New England defense this week.  Marcus Pollard  , TE IND - Free A= gent Updated 10/18/01 Pollard has emerged as Indianpolis' top option at tig= ht end. He will once again be a key factor in the passing game against New = England this week,  Edgerrin James , RB IND - JWillie Updated 10/18/01 Jame= s was held to just 55 rushing yards in his first game against New England t= his year. Expect much better numbers on James' home turf this week.  Reggie=  Wayne , WR IND - Free Agent Updated 10/18/01 Wayne is expected to start in=  place of ! th! e injured Jerome Pathon for the second consecutive week. Wa= yne has not done much yet, so don't put him in your Fantasy lineup.   Marvi= n Harrison , WR IND - Russell Updated 10/18/01 Harrison suually performs we= ll in divisional matchups, and has burned Patriots CB Ty Law in the past. E= xpect him to produce good numbers against New England.  Peyton Manning , QB=  IND - Neal/McKay Updated 10/18/01 Manning did not perform well the first t= ime he faced New England. He was intercepted by the Patriots three times, b= ut should perform better against them at home this week.  Randy Moss , WR M= IN - Russell Updated 10/18/01  Moss did not participate in practice Wednesd= ay due to his sore right ankle. He should be able to practice on Thursday a= nd play Sunday against Green Bay, but hold off deciding on whether to use h= im until it's clear whether he will be able to play.  Bill Schroeder , WR G= B - Frank Updated 10/18/01 Schroeder missed practice Wednesday with an ankl= e injury. He is receiving treatment and should play Sunday, but monitor his=  progress before deciding whether to use him this week.  Terry Glenn , WR N= E - Matty Updated 10/18/01 Glenn might have another good game this week. In= dianapolis' secondary might have trouble handling Glenn, who immediately pr= oved an early-season layoff didn't hurt him last week.  Antowain Smith , RB=  NE - JWillie Updated 10/18/01 Smith rushed for 94 yards and two TDs the fi= rst time he faced the Colts this year. Expect him to get in the end zone at=  least once this week, in his second meeting with Indianapolis.  Wayne Chre= bet , WR NYJ - JWillie Updated 10/18/01 Chrebet's numbers have been very di= sappointing so far. He could have a good week if ! th! e Jets engage in a s= hootout with the Rams. He is still a risky start, because New York will cen= ter its gameplan around Curtis Martin.   Laveranues Coles , WR NYJ - JWilli= e Updated 10/18/01 Coles has emerged as a go-to receiver for the Jets, but = might be held down by the Rams. The St. Louis defenive backs should be able=  to match his downfield speed.  Curtis Martin , RB NYJ - Tori Updated 10/18= /01 Martin will be the focal point of the New York offense this week. The J= ets will try to control the ball and the clock against the Rams.   S! te! p= hen Davis , RB WAS - Bass/Hull Updated 10/18/01 Davis had his first decent = game of the season on Monday against Dallas, but he's still a very risky Fa= ntasy player due to Washington's horrible offense. Facing Carolina is an ad= vantageous matchup, however, so starting Davis this week warrants considera= tion.   Tony Banks , QB WAS - Free Agent Updated 10/18/01 Banks was very me= diocre against Dallas on Monday night, completing 10-of-18 passes for only = 132 yards and one touchdown. At this point, Banks isn't even worth a roster=  spot outside of deeper leagues.   Michael Westbrook , WR WAS - Free Agent = Updated 10/18/01  Westbrook has been less than mediocre this season, but he=  could have a decent outing against Carolina. He's had some success against=  the Panthers in the past, but he's still only worth starting in deeper lea= gues.   Vinny Testaverde , QB NYJ - Neal/McKay Updated 10/18/01 Testaverde = might not be a good start this week. The St. Louis defense can be opportuni= stic, and could very well make the Jets QB throw his first interception of = the year.  Walter Rasby , TE WAS - Free Agent Updated 10/18/01 Rasby will l= ikely get most of the work at tight end ! no! w that Stephen Alexander is o= ut. However, he warrants no real Fantasy consideration at this point.   Rod=  Gardner , WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 10/18/01 Gardner could have a decent=  game against a questionable Carolina secondary on Monday. He's worth consi= dering as a starter Fantasy-wise, but only in larger leagues.   Torry Holt = , WR STL - Tori Updated 10/18/01 Holt has the potential to post big numbers=  against a shaky N.Y. Jets secondary on Sunday. He's a big time Fantasy wid= eout and should be in your starting lineup on a weekly basis.   Isaac Bruce=  , WR STL - Frank Updated 10/18/01 Bruce hasn't been very consistent thus f= ar, but he's far too talented to ever consider benching. Look for him to tu= rn things around against the questionable N.Y. Jets secondary.   Ernie Conw= ell , TE STL - Free Agent Updated 10/18/01 Conwell has become a decent tigh= t end from a Fantasy perspective this season. He's worth staring on a weekl= y basis if you don't have a more reliable tight end on your roster.   Trung=  Canidate , RB STL - Giggles Updated 10/18/01 Canidate will ! li! kely repl= ace Marshall Faulk as St. Louis' featured back this weekend against the N.Y= . Jets. He has a good knowledge of the Rams' offense and is easily worth st= arting this week from a Fantasy perspective.   Kurt Warner , QB STL - Hunte= r Updated 10/18/01 Considering the huge numbers he puts up on a consistent = basis, Warner is a a must-start every week. He'll post another big game aga= inst the New York Jets on Sunday, so be sure to put him your lineup.   Corr= ell Buckhalter , RB PHI - Free Agent Updated 10/18/01 Buckhalter isn't expe= cted to start, but don't be surprised if he gets the majority of the carrie= s on Monday night against the Giants. Coach Andy Reid will start Duce Stale= y in the backfield, but Buckhalter will likely be the more productive o! f = ! the two backs.   Donovan McNabb , QB PHI - Russell Updated 10/18/01 McNab= b is one of the top Fantasy players in the league, and is worth starting on=  a weekly basis. He should beat the Giants for two scores and around 275 ya= rds on Monday night, so be sure to get him into your lineup.   Todd Pinksto= n , WR PHI - Hunter Updated 10/18/01 Pinkston is slowly becoming one of Don= ovan McNabb's favorite targets this season. He's worth starting against the=  Giants, whose secondary is a bit suspect at this point.   Tyrone Wheatley =  , RB OAK - Giggles Updated 10/18/01 The Contra-Costa Times says Wheatley h= as sustained a sprained medial collateral ligament in his right knee. Altho= ugh some sources say Wheatley will miss two to four weeks, Jon Gruden says = Wheatley is questionable for Oct. 28, and is unaware of any prognosis beyon= d that.  Chad Lewis , TE PHI - Free Agent Updated 10/18/01 Lewis will have = a good shot at producing some solid Fantasy numbers on Monday against the N= .Y. Giants. He's one of the league's top tight ends and should be in your s= tarting lineup on a weekly basis.

Bradford has yet to prove hims= elf as a Fantasy player.  Bubba Franks , TE GB - Free Agent Updated 10/21/0= 1 Franks caught only two passes for nine yards, but one of his receptions w= as good for a two-yard TD. Franks has caught TD passes in five of six games=  this year and has become a major scori! ng! threat even though he is not v= ery effective outside of the red zone.  Derrick Alexander , WR KC - JWillie=  Updated 10/21/01 Alexander finally had a big game, posting 99 yards receiv= ing and a touchdown against Arizona. He's been unreliable for the most part= , however, but his potential to post numbers this good makes it tough to be= nch him.   Trent Green , QB KC - Bass/Hull Updated 10/21/01 Green threw for=  352 yards and a score in Sunday's 24-16 loss to Arizona. Green has been in= consistent this season, however, and no longer warrants a starting nod ever= y week.   Doug Chapman  , RB MIN - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01 Chapman rush= ed for 90 yards on 22 carries against the Packers. His numbers were not gre= at, but he was more effective than Michael Bennett has been so far. Chapman=  may continue to see a good amount of carries if Bennett cannot stay health= y or continues to struggle.  David Boston , WR ARI - Bass/Hull Updated 10/2= 1/01 Boston had a big game against Kansas City, posting seven receptions fo= r 131 yards and a score. He's emerging as one of the best receivers in the = league and is worth starting on a weekly basis.   ! Mi! chael Pittman , RB = ARI - Matty Updated 10/21/01 Pittman had a great outing on Sunday against K= ansas City, posting 137 yards of total offense and a touchdown. Pittman won= 't post numbers this good with any regularity, but he's still a valuable pl= ayer to have on your roster.   Jeff Graham , WR SD - Free Agent Updated 10/= 21/01 Graham came up huge for San Diego on Sunday, catching seven passes fo= r 107 yards and two scores against Denver. He's still not reliable enough t= o start on a regular basis, but he's certainly worth a roster spot.   LaDai= nian Tomlinson , RB SD - Hunter Updated 10/21/01 ! Tomlinson was held in ch= eck for the first time this season by Denver on Sunday. The rookie tailback=  rushed for only 58 yards on the day, but he's still one of the top Fantasy=  players in the league.   Desmond Clark , TE DEN - Free Agent Updated 10/21= /01 Clark had a big game on Sunday, catching six passes for 54 yards and a = score against San Diego. He's been reliable as far as tight ends go from a = Fantasy perspective, so continue to start him on a weekly basis.   Brian Gr= iese , QB DEN - Matty Updated 10/21/01 Griese (shoulder) started Sunda! y'!=  s game against San Diego, but he was ineffective. He posted 212 yards pass= ing, a touchdown and two interceptions in Denver's 27-10 loss.   Peter Warr= ick , WR CIN - Giggles Updated 10/21/01 Warrick caught eight passes for 84 = yards against Chicago. But the potentially explosive wideout is hurting his=  owners, because he does not find the end zone often.   Corey Dillon , RB C= IN - Frank Updated 10/21/01 The Bears held Dillon to just 30 yards on 16 ca= rries. Expect the veteran runner to bounce back from such a quiet performan= ce very quickly.  ! David Terrell , WR CHI - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01 Te= rrell caught seven passes for 91 yards against Cincinnati. With Marcus Robi= nson injured, Terrell should assume a more prominent role in the Chicago pa= ssing game.  Anthony Thomas , RB CHI - Martin Updated 10/21/01 Thomas rushe= d for 188 yards and a TD against Cincinnati, clearly establishing himself a= s Chicago's top RB. Expect him to be the Bears' featured back for the rest = of the year.  Frank Wycheck , TE TEN - Matty Updated 10/21/01 Wycheck caugh= t seven passes for 100 yards and a TD at Detroit. ! De! spite some quiet ou= tings until this week, he remains a top-notch Fantasy TE, especially with t= he Titans lacking in talent at wide receiver.   Charlie Batch , QB DET - Fr= ee Agent Updated 10/21/01 Batch threw for 338 yards, three TDs and was inte= rcepted once in a loss to Tennessee. Batch has stacked up good numbers in t= wo consecutive weeks, but he remains a Fantasy risk because of his history = of inconsistency.  Steve McNair , QB TEN - Martin Updated 10/21/01 McNair t= hrew for 216 yards, a TD and was intercepted twice at Detroit. He completed=  only 15 of 35 attempts, and many of his throws were inaccurate, possibly i= ndicating he still might be bothered by shoulder problems.!  Eddie George ,=  RB TEN - Tori Updated 10/21/01 George was held to 51 yards on 26 carries b= y Detroit. The lack of a reliable passing game in Tennessee has certainly h= indered his production this year.   Shawn Jefferson , WR ATL - Free Agent U= pdated 10/21/01 Jefferson caught three passes for 67 yards and a TD against=  the Saints. The speedy wideout has a long history of inconsistency, so don= 't expect good numbers from him every week.  Alge Crumpler , TE ATL - Free = Agent Updated 10/21/01 Crumpler caught five passes for 78 yards and a TD ag= ainst New Orleans. Expect good totals from the big, quick tight end for the=  remainder of the year.  Albert Connell , WR NO - Free Agent Updated 10/21/= 01 Connell caught only one pass for five yards against Atlanta. It is defin= itely time to give up on the disappointing wideout.  Willie Jackson , WR NO=  - Martin Updated 10/21/01 Jackson finished with only 46 receiving yards on=  five catches against the Falcons. Mediocre numbers against the low-quality=  Atlanta defense indicate Jackson is not capa! bl! e of providing owners wi= th regularly good numbers.  Hines Ward , WR PIT - Tori Updated 10/21/01 War= d was limited to 44 yards on three catches by Tampa Bay. Ward is still maki= ng important receptions for the Steelers, but his Fantasy appeal is limited=  because of Pittsburgh's inability to consistently score in the air.  Warri= ck Dunn , RB TB - Martin Updated 10/21/01 Dunn played despite a foot injury=  that had bothered him during the week, but he was limited to 31 yards on 1= 3 carries by a physical Pittsburgh defense.  Anthony Becht , TE NYJ - Free = Agent Updated 10/21/01 Becht had a huge game against St. Louis, posting fiv= e catches for 35 yards and two scores. He's been inconsistent this season, = however, but his potential to post good numbers makes him worth starting at=  a position lacking quality players.   Keyshawn Johnson , WR TB - Giggles U= pdated 10/21/01 Johnson caught 10 passes for 159 yards against Pittsburgh. = He has developed a good on-field relationship with QB Brad Johnson. The vet= eran wideout should continue to post high-quality numbers on a regular basi= s.  Jerome Bettis , RB PIT - Giggles Updated 10/21/01 Bettis rushed for 143=  yards and a TD on 17 carries against Tampa Bay. He also threw a 32-yard TD=  pass. His fine outing proves Bettis can compile good numbers against any d= efense.  Trung Canidate , RB STL - Giggles Updated 10/21/01 Canidate had a = huge game against the New York Jets, posting 232 yards of total offense and=  two scores. His role as the Rams' featured back may be short-lived, howeve= r, depending on the health of stud back Marshall Faulk.   Rod Gardner , WR = WAS - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01 Gardner had a huge game on Sunday, pos! t= i! ng six catches for 208 yards and a score against Carolina. He seems to h= ave overtaken Michael Westbrook as the No. 1 receiving target in Washington= , and is worth a roster spot from a Fantasy perspective.

Damon Jones , TE JAC - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Jones = is expected to resume practicing on Wednesday. An MRI on his shoulder showe= d that his injury would not require surgery.   Fred Taylor , RB JAC - Marti= n Updated 10/23/01 Taylor has been ruled out of Sunday's game against Balti= more and his status for next week's game remains uncertain. ""All I know is = that, from week to week, they increase his exercises and change of directio= n,"" head coach Tom Coughlin told The Florida Times-Union. ""It remains to be=  seen when Fred will be able to play. Progress is slow. I'm hoping he respo= nds well this week, then we can make some kind of legitimate guess [about a=  return date] next week."" Taylor has been inactive since severely injuring = his groin on Sept 23.     Dennis Northcutt , WR CLE - Free Agent Updated 10= /23/01 Northcutt left Sunday's game because of a concussion. He is expected=  to play when the Browns return to action next week.   Todd Heap , TE BAL -=  Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Heap did not play Sunday but head coach Brian = Billick told The Baltimore Sun he is optimistic that the rookie will play i= n this week's game. Heap has been inactive for the last four games because = of a sprained ankle.   Terry Allen , RB BAL - Tori Updated 10/23/01 Allen, = who left after the fifth play of Sunday's game with a sprained ankle, is qu= estionable for this week's game. Jason Brookins will start at running back = if Allen is inactive.   Elvis Grbac , QB BAL - Tori Updated 10/23/01 Coach = Brian Billick expects Grbac to be ready for Sunday's game against Jacksonvi= lle, but the quarterback wasn't so sure. ""I'm day-to-day. I'm feeling prett= y sore in the chest area,"" Grbac said Monday. ""There could be something goi= ng on with the cartilage. I haven't picked up a ball or thrown a ball, so w= e'll just have to wait and see."" Randall Cunningham will replace Grbac if h= e is unable to play.     Az-Zahir Hakim , WR STL - Neal/McKay Updated 10/23= /01 Hakim suffered a calf injury during Sunday's blowout win over the New Y= ork Jets. However, he is expected to be available for this weekend's game a= gainst New Orleans.   Trung Canidate , RB STL - Giggles Updated 10/23/01 Ac= cording to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, Canidate is expected to start in pl= ace of Marshall Faulk this weekend against New Orleans. ""I wouldn't expect = Marshall to be up for this game,"" coach Mike Martz said. ""He's got to be 10= 0 percent before I would be convinced that we've got to let him play. And i= f he's not, then he doesn't play."" Canidate proved himself as a worthy repl= acement last Sunday against the Jets, and should be starting from a Fantasy=  perspective again this week.     J.J. Stokes , WR SF - Matty Updated 10/23= /01 Stokes spent much of the bye week tending to his injured legs, and is c= lose to being completely healthy. ""Thankfully the bye week came so early. I= t was a blessing for me because I was ab! le! to get treatment every day,"" = Stokes told the Contra Costa Times . ""I practiced today good. I wouldn't sa= y I'm 100 percent but I'm darn close."" Stokes has been less than mediocre, = however, so don't use him as a regular starter unless he proves himself to = be more reliable.   Ike Hilliard , WR NYG - Russell Updated 10/23/01 Hillia= rd continues to improve each week, and could be back in the Giants' startin= g lineup within the next few weeks. Hilliard led the G-Men with six catches=  for 80 yards on Monday night against Philadelphia, and looked as though hi= s surgically-repaired foot is almost completely healed.   Ron Dixon , WR NY= G - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01!  Dixon missed Monday night's 10-9 loss to = the Philadelphia Eagles due to a sprained ankle. The reserve wideout is day= -to-day.   Marshall Faulk , RB STL - Matty Updated 10/23/01 According to He= ad Coach Mike Martz, Faulk is questionable for Sunday's game against New Or= leans. ""I'm just taking the same posture that we did a week ago,"" Martz sai= d. ""I would not expect Marshall to be up (active) for this game. He's got t= o be 100 percent before I'll be convinced that we've got to let him play."" = Trung Canidate would once again start in Faulk's absence is he's unable to = go.    Anthony Wright , QB DAL - Free Agent! Updated 10/23/01 Wright is exp= ected to start Sunday's game against Arizona despite swelling in his right = knee. Ryan Leaf could see some action in the game, however, so starting Wri= ght from a Fantasy perspective isn't advisable.   Dez White , WR CHI - Free=  Agent Updated 10/23/01 According to the Chicago Sun-Times, White will star= t in place of the injured Marcus Robinson. White has struggled with his bal= l-catching abilities, however, so be cautious in picking him up outside of = deeper leagues.   David Terrell , WR CHI - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 ! Te= ! rrell will not start at wide receiver in place of the injured Marcus Robi= nson, as was reportedly earlier. The Chicago Sun-Times is now reporting tha= t Dez White will start in place of Robinson, with Terrell being used as the=  team's third receiver.   Tony Martin , WR ATL - Free Agent Updated 10/23/0= 1 Martin will have an X-ray on his broken right collarbone this week. The t= eam feels confident that Martin will be available for their Nov. 11 game ag= ainst Dallas, so Fantasy owners should keep him on reserve until then.   Ro= b Moore , WR ARI - Martin Updated 10/23/01 According to Cardinals coach Dav= e McGinnis, Moore may not play a regular season g! am! e this season. Moore= , who has been dealing with a hamstring injury, continues to have setbacks = in his recovery. ""I was hoping we'd see him by now, McGinnis told the Arizo= na Republic. ""That's why we both handled it like we did in training camp an= d we paced him. We were planning to have him from the start. I can't tell y= ou when he'll be back. Until he can practice for a couple of weeks, we won'= t have him."" If Moore is still on your Fantasy roster, now is the time to l= et him go.   Tiki Barber , RB NYG - Neal/McKay Updated 10/22/01 Barber, who=  is probable with a hamstring injury, is expected to play Monday night agai= nst Philadelphia. Still, he will not get many carries, as Ron Dayne is expe= cted to get the bulk of the work. Barber might be on the verge of losing th= e starting job outright for the remainder of the season.  Richard Huntley ,=  RB CAR - Free Agent Updated 10/22/01 Panthers Head Coach George Seifert sa= id Monday that Huntley will enter Week Seven as the team's starting tailbac= k. ""He has progressed from the standpoint that he is now healthy,"" said Sei= fert. ""Here's a golden opportunity."" See if Huntley is still available in y= our league, as he looks to be the first player given a shot to claim the Ca= rolina starting RB job.  Jacquez Green , WR TB - Free Agent Updated 10/22/0= 1 Green suffered a left hip sprain during Sunday's game against Pittsburgh.=  The injury will prevent him from practicing much this week, and could keep=  him out of next Sunday's game against Minnesota. Monitor Green's progress = during the week before deciding whether to use him in Week ! Se! ven.  Keys= hawn Johnson , WR TB - Giggles Updated 10/22/01 Johnson was sidelined for t= he final minutes of Sunday's game against Pittsburgh due to a right hip fle= xor strain. He will be limited in practice this week and could miss next Su= nday's game against Minnesota. Keep an eye on Johnson's progress this week = as you prepare your lineup for Week Seven.  Warrick Dunn , RB TB - Martin U= pdated 10/22/01 Dunn suffered a strained right hamstring during Sunday's ga= me against Pittsburgh. ""I don't know what kind of situation we're going to = be in,"" Bucs Head Coach Tony Dungy t! ol! d the St. Petersburg Times . ""War= rick pulled a muscle, and he may be out a little while. So I don't know who=  it'll be carrying the load."" Dunn's backup, Aaron Stecker, is also injured= , so be careful considering starting any Tampa Bay running backs in Week Se= ven.  Brett Favre , QB GB - Frank Updated 10/22/01 Favre injured his right = elbow in the final seconds of Sunday's game at Minnesota. Fortunately, the = Packers have a bye week in Week Seven, so he should have time to recover. ""= It'll be OK,"" Favre told the Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel. ""Thank goodness I = have a week to relax. I think that will help.""  James Stewart , RB DET - ! = H! unter Updated 10/22/01 Stewart left Sunday's game against Tennessee in t= he fourth quarter with a sprained right ankle. He is listed as day to day, = and Lamont Warren finished the game in his absence.  More Updates [IMAGE]  = Copyright 2001 Commissioner.COM Inc and SportsLine.com Inc.

If you have the roster room, it would be a good idea to stash = both backs on your team to ensure you're safe if Watters takes the job back=  from Alexander down the stretc! h.!   Trent Dilfer , QB SEA - Free Agent U= pdated 10/23/01 Dilfer was unable to practice on Monday due to a groin inju= ry. He has lost the starting QB job to Matt Hasselbeck, and shouldn't be on=  any Fantasy rosters at this point.  Matt Hasselbeck , QB SEA - Bass/Hull U= pdated 10/23/01 Hasselbeck will be the Seahawks' starting quarterback for S= unday's game against Miami, according to the Seattle Post-Intelligencer. He=  replaces Trent Dilfer, who stood in for Hasselbeck as he was sidelined wit= h a pulled groin. This isn't a very favorable matchup for Hasselbeck from! = a!

He will have an MRI on Tuesday to determi= ne the extent of the concussion he suffered Sunday against the Rams.  Dedri= c Ward , WR MIA - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Ward missed Monday's practice=  due to a foot injury. He is expected to miss Sunday's game at Seattle, and=  isn't a useful Fantasy player at this point in the season.  Lamar Smith , = RB MIA - Neal/McKay Updated 10/23/01 Smith did not practice Monday due to a= n ankle injury.

Marvin Minnis , WR KC - Free Agent Updated 1= 0/23/01 Chiefs Head Coach Dick Vermail said Monday that Minnis might start = ahead of Chris Thomas in Thursday's game against Indianapolis. We don't rec= ommend you use either receiver despite the fact that the Colts' secondary i= s hardly imposing. Neither player is going to be a clear-cut starter this w= eek.

Duc= e Staley , RB PHI - Giggles Updated 10/23/01 Staley started Monday's game a= gainst the N.Y. Giants, but he didn't finish it. Staley carried the ball ju= st three times for 22 yards, and was spelled late in the game by rookie Cor= rell Buckhalter, who gained 34 yards on 11 carries lat! e ! in the game. At=  this point, it's tough to depend on Staley to post consistent Fantasy numb= ers, so consider reserving him if your roster allows for a solid replacemen= t.   Joe Nedney , K TEN - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Nedney suffered a nec= k injury in Sunday's game but is expected to play this week.

""I wouldn't expect Marshall to be up for this game,"" coach Mike = Martz said. ""He's got to be 100 percent before I would be convinced that we= 've got to let him play. And if he's not, then he doesn't play."" Canidate p= roved himself as a worthy replacement last Sunday against the Jets, and sho= uld be starting from a Fantasy perspective again this week.     J.J. Stokes=  , WR SF - Matty Updated 10/23/01 Stokes spent much of the bye week tending=  to his injured legs, and is close to being completely healthy. ""Thankfully=  the bye week came so early. It was a blessing for me because I was abl! e = ! to get treatment every day,"" Stokes told the Contra Costa Times . ""I prac= ticed today good. I wouldn't say I'm 100 percent but I'm darn close."" Stoke= s has been less than mediocre, however, so don't use him as a regular start= er unless he proves himself to be more reliable.   Ike Hilliard , WR NYG - = Russell Updated 10/23/01 Hilliard continues to improve each week, and is no= w back in the Giants' starting lineup. Hilliard led the G-Men with six catc= hes for 80 yards on Monday night against Philadelphia, and looked as though=  his surgically-repaired foot is almost completely healed.   Ron Dixon , WR=  NYG - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Dixon missed Monday night's 10-9 loss to=  the Philadelphia Eagles due to a sprained ankle. The reserve wideout is da= y-to-day.   Marshall Faulk , RB STL - Matty Updated 10/23/01 According to H= ead Coach Mike Martz, Faulk is questionable for Sunday's game against New O= rleans. ""I'm just taking the same posture that we did a week ago,"" Martz sa= id. ""I would not expect Marshall to be up (active) for this game. He's got = to be 100 percent before I'll be convinced that we've got to let him play.""=  Trung Canidate would once again start in Faulk's absence is he's unable to=  go.

""At this point in time, I'= m on schedule to play this Sunday,"" Davis said.   Davis admitted that his r= ight knee remains sore, but he has been well enough to play on the scout te= am the past two weeks.   He remained on the scout team Wednesday. Davis was=  listed as questionable on the weekly injury report.      Amani Toomer  , W= R NYG - Tori Updated 10/24/01   According to published reports, Toomer migh= t be benched in favor of WR Joe Jurevicius. Ike Hilliard will join Jurevici= us if Toomer is demoted. Toomer caught only three passes Monday night again= st the Eagles and did not have a reception for more than 10 yards. Head coa= ch Jim Fassel demoted Toomer last season, in an effort to motivate him.    =  Wayne Chrebet  , WR NYJ - JWillie Updated 10/24/01   Chrebet will miss Sun= day's game at Carolina with a head injury. Coach Herman Edwards described C= hrebet's ailment as ""post-trauma migraines"" and said he wanted to be extra = cautious with the injury.   Edwards said Chrebet passed the various tests a= nd scans he was given. Chrebet will be replaced by Kevin Swayne, a 26-year-= old rookie who played in both the Arena League and the XFL during the past = year. He has now been playing football for 40 straight weeks and has one ca= tch for 19 yards in the NFL.      Chris Sanders  , WR TEN - Free Agent Upda= ted 10/24/01   Sanders will not require surgery on his back. He will be re-= evaluated after receiving an injection. His return date is unclear.    Bert=  Emanuel  , WR NE - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01   Emanuel signed with the D= etroit Lions on Wednesday. While the Lions are looking for a receiver to he= lp fill the void created by a season-ending injury to Germane Crowell, Eman= uel won't get the first crack at the job. Don't bother picking him up.    H= ines Ward  , WR PIT - Tori Updated 10/24/01   Ward is day to day with an an= kle injury. He is listed as probable for Monday's game against Tennessee.  =   Germane Crowell  , WR DET - Giggles Updated 10/24/01   The Detroit Lions = placed Crowell on injured reserve on Tuesday with a torn patella tendon in = his left knee, which ends his season.    Santana Moss  , WR NYJ - Free Agen= t Updated 10/24/01   The New York Daily News says there is still a noticeab= le hitch in Moss' stride as he rceovers from knee surgery. The earliest the=  Jets expect him to return is Dec. 2.    Brett Favre  , QB GB - Frank Updat= ed 10/24/01   Favre skipped Tuesday's practice due to general soreness. Wit= h Green Bay on the bye this week, expect him to be fully recovered in time = for Week Eight.    Marvin Minnis  , WR KC - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01   E= arly indications this week were Minnis would return to the starting lineup.=  But the Kansas City Star notes Chris Thomas is still working with the firs= t team in practice. There is no official word on which player will start on=  Thursday against the Colts.    Larry Foster  , WR DET - Free Agent Updated=  10/24/01   According to the Detroit Free Press , Foster is expected to sta= rt in Germane Crowell's place Sunday against Cincinnati. Foster is an inexp= erienced wideout not worthy of picking up in Fantasy leagues right now. Mon= itor his progress over the next few weeks.    Marcus Robinson  , WR CHI - H= unter Updated 10/24/01   The Bears placed Robinson on injured reserve on Tu= esday with torn ligaments in his left knee, effectively ending his season. = Drop him unless you play in a keeper league.    Neil Rackers  , K CIN - Fre= e Agent Updated 10/24/01   According to the Cincinnati Enquirer , the Benga= ls worked out three kickers, and did not sign one. Rackers' job is temporar= ily safe, but he is a big Fantasy risk because of his erratic play.    Todd=  Pinkston  , WR PHI - Hunter Updated 10/24/01   Pinkston has a strained wri= st but is expected to play in Sunday's game. He will be evaluated on a day = to day basis.     Ron Dixon  , WR NYG - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01   Dixon=  missed Monday game because of a sprained ankle. He has made progress in hi= s recovery and might play this week.    Joe Jurevicius  , WR NYG - Free Age= nt Updated 10/24/01   Ike Hilliard regained his starting position Monday, r= eturning Jurevicius to the role of a reserve. Jurevicius was productive as = a starter in Hilliard's absence. However, he will be useless as the No. 3 r= eceiver. There is a chance that he could return to starting lineup and repl= ace Amani Toomer. Toomer has been inconsistent this season. Jurevicius play= ed alongside Hilliard a few times in Sunday's game while Toomer stood on th= e sidelines.     Reggie Swinton  , WR DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01   S= winton is suffering from a hamstring injury and is questionable for Sunday'= s game against Arizona. ""He [Swinton] worked with the trainers on Monday an= d did some things, but he didn't do enough to say for sure he will be avail= able,"" said head coach Dave Campo. Darrin Chiaverini and Raghib Ismail will=  get more playing time in his absence.     Joey Galloway  , WR DAL - Giggle= s Updated 10/24/01   Galloway is listed as questionable for this week's gam= e against the Cardinals, but the Cowboys are optimistic about his chances o= f playing. He is recovering from a sprained foot. ""We're expecting some lim= ited practice tomorrow, so I would say he is questionable from the standpoi= nt that it will depend on how he improves the next two or three days,"" said=  head coach Dave Campo.       Darrin Chiaverini  , WR DAL - Free Agent Upda= ted 10/24/01   Chiaverini practiced Monday and is listed as probable for Su= nday's game against the Cardinals. He is recovering from a left knee injury= .     Raghib Ismail  , WR DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01   Ismail, recov= ering from a sprained knee, practiced Monday without any problems. He is li= sted as probable for this week's game.     Ricky Watters  , RB SEA - Free A= gent Updated 10/23/01   According to the Tacoma News Tribune , Seahawks Hea= d Coach Mike Holmgren says that Watters will return to the starting lineup = as soon as he's healthy, which could be another month or longer. ""We'll cro= ss that bridge when we come to it,"" Holmgren said. ""I would be surprised if=  I didn't insert Ricky back into the lineup. He was our best player when he=  got hurt. Shaun (Alexander) has come in and played well. But I would suspe= ct that when Ricky can play, he'll play again."" If you have the roster room= , it would be a good idea to stash both backs on your team to ensure you're=  safe if Watters takes the job back from Alexander down the stretch.    Tre= nt Dilfer  , QB SEA - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01   Dilfer was unable to pr= actice on Monday due to a groin injury. He has lost the starting QB job to = Matt Hasselbeck, and shouldn't be on any Fantasy rosters at this point.    = Matt Hasselbeck  , QB SEA - Bass/Hull Updated 10/23/01   Hasselbeck will be=  the Seahawks' starting quarterback for Sunday's game against Miami, accord= ing to the Seattle Post-Intelligencer . He replaces Trent Dilfer, who stood=  in for Hasselbeck as he was sidelined with a pulled groin. This isn't a ve= ry favorable matchup for Hasselbeck from a Fantasy perspective, so don't us= e him this week.    Wayne Chrebet  , WR NYJ - JWillie Updated 10/23/01   Th= e Jets have listed Chrebet as questionable for next Sunday's game at Caroli= na. He will have an MRI on Tuesday to determine the extent of the concussio= n he suffered Sunday against the Rams.    Dedric Ward  , WR MIA - Free Agen= t Updated 10/23/01   Ward missed Monday's practice due to a foot injury. He=  is expected to miss Sunday's game at Seattle, and isn't a useful Fantasy p= layer at this point in the season.    Lamar Smith  , RB MIA - Neal/McKay Up= dated 10/23/01   Smith did not practice Monday due to an ankle injury. He i= s still expected to play Sunday in Seattle, so don't be afraid to use him t= his week.    Marvin Minnis  , WR KC - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01   Chiefs = Head Coach Dick Vermail said Monday that Minnis might start ahead of Chris = Thomas in Thursday's game against Indianapolis. We don't recommend you use = either receiver despite the fact that the Colts' secondary is hardly imposi= ng. Neither player is going to be a clear-cut starter this week.    Jerome = Pathon  , WR IND - Tori Updated 10/23/01   Pathon might miss his third stra= ight game Thursday at Kansas City due to a sprained right foot. Don't use h= im this week.    Terrence Wilkins  , WR IND - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01  =  Wilkins is questionable for Thursday's game at Kansas City due to broken r= ibs. We don't recommend you use him in a Fantasy league this week.    Terre= ll Davis  , RB DEN - JWillie Updated 10/23/01   Davis is still targeting Su= nday's game against New England as his comeback game from arthroscopic knee=  surgery, but the Broncos have not decided whether they will activate him. = He will work in practice this week and the Broncos hope to know by Wednesda= y whether Davis can play. We don't recommend you use Davis in a Fantasy lea= gue unless it's absolutely certain he's Denver's starting running back and = is 100 percent healthy.    More Updates    Player News Teams   [IMAGE]   Ne= al/McKay Player News    Lamar Smith  , Active RB Updated 10/23/01  Smith di= d not practice Monday due to an ankle injury. He is still expected to play = Sunday in Seattle, so don't be afraid to use him this week.    Az-Zahir Hak= im  , Active WR Updated 10/23/01  Hakim suffered a calf injury during Sunda= y's blowout win over the New York Jets. However, he is expected to be avail= able for this weekend's game against New Orleans.    Tony Richardson  , Res= erve RB Updated 10/22/01  Richardson (shoulder) did play against the Cardin= als. He was used in goal-line packages and had one carry and one reception = for 24 total yards. He will probably be used sparingly as a runner now that=  Priest Holmes has clearly emerged as a featured back.    Tiki Barber  , Re= serve RB Updated 10/22/01  Barber, who is probable with a hamstring injury,=  is expected to play Monday night against Philadelphia. Still, he will not = get many carries, as Ron Dayne is expected to get the bulk of the work. Bar= ber might be on the verge of losing the starting job outright for the remai= nder of the season.    Freddie Jones  , Reserve TE Updated 10/22/01  Jones = sprained his ankle against Denver. His current status is day to day.    Vin= ny Testaverde  , Reserve QB Updated 10/21/01  Testaverde was replaced by Ch= ad Pennington in the second half of Sunday's game against St. Louis. The mo= ve wasn't injury related, but simply Jets' coach Herm Edwards giving Pennin= gton some playing time in a blowout game. Testaverde finished the afternoon=  9-of-13 for 74 yards with a touchdown and an interception.    Mike Anderso= n  , Active RB Updated 10/19/01  Anderson may find it difficult to reach 10= 0 yards against the Chargers. San Diego has a strong front seven, and the B= roncos are having trouble with blocking on end runs.    Peyton Manning  , A= ctive QB Updated 10/18/01  Manning did not perform well the first time he f= aced New England. He was intercepted by the Patriots three times, but shoul= d perform better against them at home this week.    Ron Dayne  , Reserve RB=  Updated 10/18/01  Dayne has emerged as New York's main threat in the backf= ield, and has been relatively productive in the role. Even with Tiki Barber=  back in the mix, we expect Dayne to get the majority of the carries in the=  game. He'll have a tough time running on the Eagles' defense, however, be = he's still worth starting in deeper Fantasy leagues.    Keenan McCardell  ,=  Active WR Updated 10/17/01  McCardell struggled in his first few games bac= k from injury, but looked like his old self in the previous game. Look for = McCardell to play well this week and catch a lot of passes.    Jerry Rice  = , Active WR Updated 10/12/01  Rice should have another good outing. He shou= ld draw inexperienced Indianapolis CB David Macklin in coverage, which mean= s Rice will definitely be a TD threat again this week.    Shawn Bryson  , R= eserve RB Updated 08/23/01  Bryson suffered a sprained ankle during practic= e on Thursday. He was scheduled to have X-rays later in the day, but the te= am has diagnosed it as a simple sprain at this point. Bryson, who will be a=  game-time decision for this weekend's game at Cincinnati, is worth a later= -round flier at best on Draft Day.    Broncos  , Active DT Updated 08/23/01=   Defensive tackle Chester McGlockton, who suffered a slight ligament tear = in his knee during Monday's preseason game, is expected to be ready for the=  start of the regular season. Denver's defense has the talent to be a solid=  unit from a Fantasy perspective, and will be one of the top ten defenses t= aken on Draft Day.    Matt Stover  , Active K Updated 12/08/00  Stover need= s just nine more field goals over the final three weeks of the season to br= eak the NFL single-season record of 39 (Olindo Mare, 1999). Expect him to g= et plenty of chances against San Diego on Sunday, and ensure that he's in y= our active playoff lineup each week.

"**********************************************  New at Meridien Research for October 24, 2001  1. Online Mortgages: Appraising the Options 2. Electronic Invoice Presentment and Payment: The Key to Lockbox 3. Invest in Wireless Payments  Registered clients can access research directly.

Online Mortgages: Appraising the Options (Retail e-Financial Services Client Access) http://www.meridien-research.com/doc.asp?docid=799  For most individuals, a mortgage is likely to be the largest loan they ever incur. For this reason, it is not hard to imagine why, to date, many mortgage seekers have hesitated to use the Internet as a channel for loan origination. Concerns about the validity of data, use of a new technology, and security contribute to this hesitancy. However, with mortgage interest rates near 30-year lows and consumers refinancing existing mortgages at high levels, the current economic conditions have created a positive environment for online mortgage lending to flourish. This report describes four potential business models a financial institution may adopt when implementing its own Internet strategy for mortgage lending.   2. Electronic Invoice Presentment and Payment: The Key to Lockbox (Wholesale e-Financial Services access) (e-Payments Client access) http://www.meridien-research.com/doc.asp?docid=800  Banks have traditionally handled the collection and processing of remittance information and payments for their corporate customers through physical lockbox facilities. Corporations, however, are increasingly moving their payment function online. In the process, they are losing the paper-bound connection of payment to remittance; now they are looking for ways to keep their collection information integrated with their billing information. Electronic invoice presentment and payment (EIPP) is one solution to their problem, and it brings both challenges and opportunities to banks. While EIPP does threaten the lockbox revenues of banks, it offers them the means to expand their involvement in their customers' payment and collection processes by completing the invoice-payment-remittance-settlement cycle. This report explores the roles that exist for banks in the EIPP space and the strategies they can employ as they look for ways to continue serving their corporate customers.   3. Invest in Wireless Payments A Meridien/FSTC report (Meridien clients - all services - only) http://www.meridien-research.com/misc/fstc/invest_in_wireless_payments.asp Financial institutions and mobile telecommunications firms in Europe and Asia are already introducing wireless payment capability. We see opportunities in the United States as well for financial institutions and telcos to work together to develop wireless payment solutions that can both meet corporate goals and address the structural issues existing in the American wireless environment. Telcos are now urgently assessing strategies to attain profitability; wireless payments are a key element to meet that goal. Financial institutions that act quickly can participate as new wireless payment capabilities are developed, thereby ensuring that solutions also meet the needs of their industry and their customers.   **********************************************************   Meridien Research 2020 Commonwealth Avenue Newton, Massachusetts 02466 Tel: +1.617.796.2800 Fax: +1.617.796.2850 mailing@meridien-research.com  To be removed from our email distribution list, reply to this message with the word REMOVE in the subject line.",scott.neal@enron.com,mailing@meridien-research.com,Online Mortgages; EIPP; Wireless Payments - New at Meridien,2001-10-25 10:22:07-07:00,received

James Hodgins  , RB STL - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01  =  Hodgins is suffering from a toe injury and is questionable for Sunday's ga= me against New Orleans.

He has been ruled out = because of broken ribs.     Jerome Pathon  , WR IND - Tori Updated 10/25/01=    Pathon will miss his third straight game Thursday at Kansas City due to = a sprained right foot.

Chris = Sanders  , WR TEN - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01   Sanders has responded wel= l to back treatment and might play Monday, according to The Nashville Tenne= ssean .

"Scott,  As discussed yesterday we really appreciate your help in moving the negotiations along for the Master with Williams Energy Marketing & Trading Company.  Just to give you some facts: We do have a GISB with Williams, of which they are the Confirming Party. Williams has made a decision not to confirm any deals less than a month in term, this is breach of contract. We currently have over 800 deals pending execution as they are not sending paper.   We have been unsuccessful for several months and the hold-up seems to be with Williams Legal group. Their Credit group is in favor of this Master as I understand it. Below are the several people we have been in contact with over the last several months.  Credit: Trey Skelton @ 918-573-5662 and Tim Neuman @ 918-573-4880 Legal:  Kelly Knowlton @ 918-573-5278  Debra Perlingiere in ENA Legal is handling the negotiations on our side and can be reached at 713-853-7658.

He was already playing with a sor= e right hip that limited him in practice last week. ""I will get an MRI in t= he morning and go from there,"" Johnson said. ""Right now, they are saying th= at it's just a bruise. But we'll know more tomorrow. I probably could not h= ave played if they needed me to. I was in pretty bad pain.""   Emmitt Smith = , RB D! AL! - Bass/Hull Updated 10/28/01 Smith pronounced himself OK despit= e having his right knee wrapped after the Dallas Cowboys' 17-3 victory over=  Arizona on Sunday. ""It's throbbing a little bit right now, but I'll be all=  right,"" Smith said. ""I felt it. I knew what it was. I didn't know the degr= ee the injury was. It worried me a bit.""   But Smith was able to walk off t= he field without assistance. He said he expects to play next week at the Ne= w York Giants. Coach Dave Campo said Smith would be re-evaluated on Monday,=  but said he was encouraged that Smith was walking around.     Daunte Culpe= pper , QB MIN - Giggles Updated 10/28/01 According to published reports, Cu= lpepper suffered a broken nose in Sunday's game against Tampa Bay. He is no= t expected to miss any game action.  Eddie Kennison , WR DEN - Free Agent U= pdated 10/28/01 Kennison rushed one time for 10 yards against New England, = and did not catch a pass. The veteran wideout has reverted back to  statist= ical silence after a brief period of productivity.   Mike Anderson , RB DEN=  - Neal/McKay Updated 10/28/01 Anderson rushed for only 40 yards on 14 carr= ies against the Patriots. He did score on an eight-yard run! , ! but the Br= oncos let Olandis Gary carry the ball 10 times for 37 yards also. Denver ap= pears to have lost some confidence in Anderson this year.  David Patten , W= R NE - Free Agent Updated 10/28/01 Patten caught five passes for 62 yards a= nd a TD at Denver. He should continue to be a scoring threat as long as he = remains one of New England's top two receivers.  Troy Brown , WR NE - Bass/= Hull Updated 10/28/01 Brown caught nine passes for 86 yards and a TD at Den= ver. He also carried the ball one time for 31 yards. Brown will always be a=  big-play threat against the weaker defensive teams on the Patriots' schedu= le.  Curtis Conway , WR SD - Giggles Updated 10/28/01 Conway caught nine pa= sses for 120 yards against Buffalo, In the past, Conway was a disappoitment= , but now he is working well with Doug Flutie and staying healthy. Conway i= s finally performing up to expectations as a Fantasy wideout.  Freddie Jone= s , TE SD - Neal/McKay Updated 10/28/01 Jo! ne! s overcame a sprained ankle=  to play against the Bills, and caught two passes for five yards. One of hi= s catches was good for a one-yard TD, and Jones may now get much of his num= bers on short TD catches. Doug Flutie seems to prefer his wideouts over the=  tight end when the Chargers are outside the red zone.  Larry Centers , RB = BUF - Free Agent Updated 10/28/01 Centers was limited to eight receiving ya= rds on four catches by San Diego. The Bills ideally want to get the ball do= wnfield to their wideouts and Jay Riemersma, so don't expect good numbers f= rom Centers ecery week.  Peerless Price , WR BUF - Free A! ge! nt Updated 1= 0/28/01 Price caught eight passes for 151 yards and a TD at San Diego. Whil= e Price is still inconsistent, he appears to have improved enough to start = for Fantasy teams occasionally.  Matt Hasselbeck , QB SEA - Bass/Hull Updat= ed 10/28/01 Hasselbeck had his best game as a pro, throwing for 230 yards, = two TDs and no interceptions. But he continued to have some troubles comple= ting key passes and getting the ball downfield on important downs.  Shaun A= lexander , RB SEA - JWillie Updated 10/28/01 ! The Dolphins held Alexander = to 87 yards on 23 carries. Considering the strength of the Miami defense, A= lexander's final numbers looked respectable, but he also fumbled twice. The=  Seattle RB will continue to post good yardage numbers, but the league's be= tter defenses might limit his overall output.  Oronde Gadsden , WR MIA - Ma= tty Updated 10/28/01 Gadsden caught only one pass for 15 yards at Seattle. = Miami's No. 1 wideout is not playing well enough to be anything more than a=  Fantasy backup.  James McKnight , WR MIA - Free Agent Updated 10/28/01 McK= night caught eight passes for 94 yards and a TD at Seattle, but also lost a=  fumble. The Miami receiver continues to be erratic and occasionally produc= tive.  Ron Dayne , RB NYG - Neal/McKay Updated 10/28/01 Dayne was held to j= ust 19 yards on eight carries by Washington. He is not putting up consisten= tly good numbers, and should not start for most Fantasy teams right now.  A= mani Toomer , WR NYG - Tori Updated 10/28/01 Toomer caught nine passes for = 109 yards and a TD against Washington. He remains a must-start Fantasy play= er, no matter w! ha! t the opposition is.  Stephen Davis , RB WAS - Bass/Hu= ll Updated 10/28/01 Davis rushed for 107 yards against the Giants, but was = held out of the end zone again. He is still running for good yardage, but t= he Redskins continue to score via the pass when they are able to move the b= all.  Tony Banks , QB WAS - Free Agent Updated 10/28/01 Banks threw for 190=  yards, two TDs and was not intercepted by the Giants. Right, now the errat= ic QB is playing well enough to be used as a Fantasy reserve.  Duce Staley = , RB PHI - Giggles Updated 10/28/01 Staley played Sunday against Oakland bu= t was held to 19 yards and a touchdown on three carries, with two catches f= or 35 yards. He was going up against a tough Raiders' rush defense, and sho= uld post better stats in future weeks. However, it bears noting that Correl= l Buckhalter led the Eagles with seven carries, which suggests that neither=  back is the clear go-to guy right now. That makes both risky starts.  Char= lie Garner , RB OAK - Russell Updated 10/28/01 Garner rushed 21 times for 7= 7 yards and a touchdown Sund! ay! at Philadelphia. This outing could put hi= m firmly in place as the Raiders' featured back while Tyrone Wheatley remai= ns sidelined.  Rich Gannon , QB OAK - Martin Updated 10/28/01 Gannon passed=  for just 158 yards, no touchdowns and no interceptions in Sunday's game at=  Philadelphia. He was facing a tall challenge in the Eagles' secondary, and=  we expect he will rebound with better stats in future weeks.  Donovan McNa= bb , QB PHI - Russell Updated 10/28/01 McNabb passed for just 133 yards and=  no touchdowns Sunday against Oakland, but he didn't get intercepted either= . It was asking a lot for him to post great stats against the Raiders' defe= nse, but this was still a disappointment. McNabb is in a bit of a slump rig= ht now, but he should break out of it and be a useful Fantasy quarterback o= ver the second half of the season.  Michael Pittman , RB ARI - Matty Update= d 10/28/01 Pittman rushed 16 times for just 29 yards Sunday at Dallas. He h= asn't been much better than Thomas Jones this season, and we don't think ei= ther player will be a reliable Fantasy option for the remainder of the year= .  David Boston , WR ARI - Bass/Hull Updated 10/28/01 Boston caught nine pa= sses for 108 yards in Sunday's game at Dallas. While Jake Plummer has been = an inconsistent quarterback from a Fantasy perspective, Boston has proven a=  worthy player because he gets most of the looks in the Arizona passing gam= e. He's easily a solid No. 2 receiver on any team.  Jake Plummer , QB ARI -=  Frank Updated 10/28/01 Plummer passed for 233 yards, no touchdowns and two=  interceptions in Sunday's game at Dallas, further exhibiting how inconsist= ent he can be. Unless the matchup dictates otherwise, you shouldn't rely on=  him for useful stats on a weekly basis.   Cowboys , DT DAL - Free Agent Up= dated 10/28/01 The Cowboys held the Cardinals to three points Sunday, and r= ecorded two sacks and two interceptions in the game. Dallas' defense has be= en somewhat decent from a Fantasy perspective based on the matchup, but don= 't let this performance fool you into believing that this unit will give yo= u consistent stats week in and week out.  Clint Stoerner , QB DAL - Free Ag= ent Updated 10/28/01 Stoerner completed 9-of-18 passes for 93 yards, no tou= chdowns and an interception while rushing for seven times for 23 yards and = a score ! in! Sunday's game against Arizona. These numbers aren't great for=  the Fantasy owner, and they came against a weak Cardinals' secondary. We d= on't recommend Stoerner for your team based on this outing.  Emmitt Smith ,=  RB DAL - Bass/Hull Updated 10/28/01 Smith left Sunday's game against Arizo= na late in the fourth quarter with a right knee injury after accumulating 8= 3 rushing yards on 21 carries. He will be evaluated shortly.  Rob Johnson ,=  QB BUF - Giggles Updated 10/28/01 Johnson left Sunday's game in the third = quarter with an apparent knee injury. He was taken to the locker room for f= urther examination and was briefly replaced by Alex Van Pelt before he retu= rned.

"I did not agree to this $50,000 pmt for Enron to keep these contracts.   I did not cut that deal nor did I agree to pay this fee.      -----Original Message----- From:  Mrha, Jean   Sent: Thursday, November 01, 2001 10:32 AM To: Gruesen, Karen Cc: Redmond, Brian; Baxter, Bryce; Neal, Scott Subject: RE: Bridgeline Payments Importance: High  Karen,  I spoke with Brian this morning and he has agreed with me that this financial obligation resides at the East desk, under Scott Neal.  It is also my understanding that when the joint venture was established that one of the deal components was that the East desk would absorb these contract positions.  As such,  I agree that the obligation should be processed and paid by Bryce's group.  If Scott or Bryce have any questions, they should meet with Brian Redmond.

If September and October are included, the amount is $700k.  My personal feeling is that the fact that no one wants to take the hit for this is irrelevant.  Contractually, Bridgeline is owed this money and the payments should have been processed by Bryce's group.  Please let me know your thoughts and if you have suggestions on how to proceed. Thanks, Karen   -----Original Message----- From:  Baxter, Bryce   Sent: Thursday, November 01, 2001 8:06 AM To: Redmond, Brian Cc: Reeves, Leslie; Gruesen, Karen; Hall, Bob M; Keiser, Kam; Valderrama, Lisa Subject: Bridgeline Payments  Brian - Bridgeline is billing us $50,000/month for two contracts where ENA has not received consent to assignment from CES by the counterparty.  Apparently the contract with Bridgeline stipulated that until such time as the consent was received on these contracts, ENA would pay this fee.  The contracts are with LGS Natural Gas Company and Entergy New Orleans, Inc.  Kam Keiser (East Risk) has spoken to Scott Neal, and he doesn't believe that the East desk should take the hit for this fee.  Bridgeline is looking for their cash, and I don't want to pay this until we have a deal booked for it.  Do you know where this charge should be booked?  I estimate that we owe Bridgeline approximately $600,000, and need to pay it as soon as possible.  Thanks for your help with this.

Here are my notes.  Did not yet have a chance to organize them, so they're simply in chronological order.  The call began with Watson, Bergstrom, and Whalley reading from prepared statements.  Watson spoke for c. 10 minutes, Bergstrom for 5, and Whalley spoke for perhaps 30 seconds.  Dynegy management was noticeably in control of the call.  Enron executives spoke when questions were directed to them.    Specific points: EES will be a part of the new company.   Enron assets will be revalued at closing.   The investment in Northern Natural takes the form of convertible preferred.  If the merger does not go through, Dynegy has the right to acquire Northern for 'very little' additional consideration.  If DYN terminates the merger and ENE 'has sufficient liquidity', ENE has right to repurchase the convertible preferred.   Debt/equity of combined company expected to be <45%. Both companies will remain on RatingsWatch negative.   ChevronTexaco will hold 169MM shares out of a total 650MM shares of the post-merger entity.   Watson reiterates that going forward, the new entity will be run with a focus on transparent and clear financial structure and disclosure, with a significant reduction in on- and off-balance-sheet leverage.   In what was termed a ""new approach"", the new entity will be run with a focus on cash flow rather than earnings.   Rumors that Dynegy did the deal because of an unhedged exposure to Enron are not true.  Dynegy owed Enron <$50MM.   Lay says that Enron had other options, 'particularly financial'. All of the discussion and activity has taken place over the last two weeks. Lay acknowledges that the number for exposure to securities lawsuits may be 'pretty big', but that the companies feel they're able to appropriately value this exposure. Lay says we have nothing else to hide, but internal investigation still under way.   Lay:  had the SPEs been capitalized with perhaps $30MM more of risk capital, there would have been no question that they would have qualified for off-balance-sheet treatment and there would have been no need to restate earnings last week to reflect consolidation of the SPEs. Dynegy says that 'several' internal investigations continue at Enron, and thus DYN/ENE cannot say with certainty that there's absolutely nothing else out there. Doty (Dynegy CFO) says that late last week, ENE had 'close to a billion' in cash.   Osprey will be unwound late next summer. Marlin will be unwound after closing. Many of the off-balance-sheet structures, including the credit-linked notes, are expected to be unwound/redeemed or at least significantly reduced prior to closing. With regard to ENE asset dispositions, these will be accelerated to the extent possible.  However, Doty says that 'our backs are not against the wall', and the company will continue to focus on getting value for its assets as well as cash. ENE will renew its 364-day facility (believe this is the $3Bn facility that we drew down a couple of weeks ago) within the next 6-8 weeks.   BBB-flat most likely rating for combined entity, according to initial comments from ratings agencies. McMahon says 'no comment' to WSJ article indicating that ENE's banks are preparing to make an equity infusion into ENE in the next few weeks. Consolidation of trading activity: Mid- and back-office consolidation will see substantial progress prior to closing, such that only the front office / trading books will need to be combined at closing.  EES, NNG and TW have no real overlap with existing DYN activity, so there won't be much integration work required there.  The big integration effort will be ENA. Watson says that the 'creative financing' surrounded non-core assets.  Doty adds that, 'frankly', DYN assigned zero economic value to non-core businesses in their valuation model.  They bracketed the maximum expected exposure from the non-core assets/businesses and left it at that. Watson mentions that DYN would not have gotten involved with Enron had they not been approached by 'Enron's top three executives', who said that they thought a combination with Dynegy made the most strategic sense for both companies.  Says that their approach evidenced a  willingness to work with DYN to integrate the two companies that made a big difference in Dynegy's deliberations on proceeding with the merger. Watson/Doty said that they're NOT 100% sure that no surprises remain in Enron's books--but that the risk/reward offered by the combination was compelling.  The deal does have material-adverse-change outs for Dynegy, covering any MAC regarding Enron's assets or businesses.  Dynegy's lawyers indicated that the MAC language was a 'blunt instrument' under which it would be difficult to bring a case, so Dynegy inserted a specific paragraph that gives Dynegy the right to terminate the merger if the Enron's total legal liability (from any source or cause of action) tops $3.5Bn prior to closing. McMahon adds that there 'could' be more restatements, but he 'does not expect' there to be more restatements. ENE international hard assets definitely on the asset disposition list. The merger structure calls for a new entity to take over Enron. Enron is planning to hold an Enron-specific conference call in the next few days, tentatively scheduled for Wednesday. Initial reaction of ratings agencies 'very positive' to combined entities.   McMahon acknowledges that Enron would have had to have an additional equity infusion prior to year-end, had the merger not materialized. Dynegy's earnings guidance places Enron-related earnings accretion at $0.90-0.95, which represents a '25% haircut' to Enron internal estimates.  Doty says that this is all operating earnings--figure does not include any amounts from expected synergies. Doty says that both Enron and Dynegy's books, as far as he understands, are relatively short-term in weight, and this will continue to be the weighting of the new entity.  Says a 'very very substantial' portion of future trading earnings will be expected to be cash. ChevronTexaco's investment in Dynegy was calculated at a 5% discount to public prices on the date of negotiation (not disclosed).  Given the runup in Dynegy stock last week, ChevronTexaco's investment is now at a 'more substantial' discount to market prices.  ChevronTexaco has provision to get 'different prices at closing if those prices are substantially better'.  (No further clarification given). Whalley believes that 'we'll retain' the Enron traders and marketers. They're used to being part of a winning team, and the combined entity will definitely be a winner.  They have talked with most of the Enron business leaders, and they are 'very excited' by the combination.  They will be working with the Enron business leaders to ensure talent is retained.  Whalley was asked if there will be any key employee retention provisions.  He says that 'to the extent necessary, yes.' Watson says that the trading strategy of the combined entity will be a combination of DYN and ENE--there will be more of an asset-backed trading focus, but by the same token the new Dynegy will be involved in much more financial market-making trading than the Dynegy of today. Watson says that if there were to be any change in culture, he's a strong team player.  He does not want to see an individual do well if the company or division does not do well.  Give me a call if you'd like me to try to clarify any of these comments.

As with Monday, I've focused on getting them out as quickly as possible rather than taking extra time to re-organize them by subject.  Enron's business has been grouped into three buckets:  Core, Non-core, and Under Review.   Core:  Wholesale energy business in North America and Europe, retail energy, pipelines Non-core:  Broadband, water, and international assets (i.e. EGAS).  Enron has approx. $8Bn in investments in these assets, and they have produced 'dismal' returns.  Enron will be exiting these businesses and will attempt to wind them up in an orderly fashion.  An aggressive divestiture program has been set in motion for these assets.   Under Review:  EGM, EIM.  These businesses are being closely examined to determine whether they have a reasonable chance of long-term viability.  Required resource levels are being carefully studied.  Following review, Enron will move the different portions of these businesses to core or non-core as the analysis dictates.   Approximately $800MM of asset sales are under contract and expected to close in the fourth quarter.  These include a gas LDC in Brazil, EcoElectrica, and our Indian E&P assets.   Enron is in active pursuit of an additional private equity infusion of $500MM-1Bn.  Given the current environment, raising equity in the public markets would be 'inefficient', McMahon says. Short-term liquidity is provided by the $3Bn of credit drawn upon a few weeks ago, the $1Bn of new debt, and the $1.5Bn equity infusion from Dynegy.  Longer-term, the proceeds from the sale of PGE will provide liquidity.  Asset sales over the next year will be used to pay down debt. McMahon described the major off-balance-sheet vehicles: Marlin was set up to hold Azurix assets.  It was initially capitalized with $950MM of 144a debt and $125MM of equity (raised from Enron and institutional investors).  The debt is supported by the equity and by Azurix' assets.  Enron is obligated to cover any deficit at the time the debt becomes due on 3/17/03 (the 'Enron topup' obligation).  The 3/17/03 date is accelerated in the event that Enron is rated below-investment-grade by any one of the three major agencies.  The primary asset of Marlin is Wessex Water.  As long as Wessex is worth at least $2.6Bn, there will be no Enron topup required.  If we take a 25% haircut to present book value, Enron will have to provide $650MM in consideration upon retirement of the debt.  This $650MM would hit Enron cash, income, and equity balances.   Osprey contains energy-related assets and 'other assets'.  It was initially capitalized with $2.4Bn of 144a debt and $220MM in equity (ENE and institutionals).  As with Marlin, the entity is an asset-backed structure with an Enron topup guarantee. The debt is supported by a) the assets; b) $1Bn of convertible preferred ENE (convertible into 50MM shares of ENE common); and c) additional ENE common as needed for topup.  Assuming the same 25% hypothetical haircut to current book value, Enron would have to deliver approx. $600MM of topup funds--which would hit ENE cash, income, and equity.  The debt must be retired by 9/17/02, with the same cut-to-junk early trigger provision as Marlin.   Yosemite and the Credit-Linked Notes are predominantly commodity transactions entered into with 'large financial institutions'.  The underlying transactions are already on Enron's balance sheet.  McMahon says that there is no Enron share obligation related to these instruments. Dynegy has reviewed all of these vehicles, McMahon says. Our 10Q will be filed five days late.  The 10Q will include all of this detail regarding the off-balance-sheet vehicles. The special committee investigation is still ongoing.  The committee meets 2-3 times/week, sometimes more often.  The outside auditors (D&T) and external counsel hired by the committee are working 'virtually 7 days a week'.  Lay estimates that it will take the committee several more weeks to complete its investigation. McMahon says it's 'way too early to tell' if any asset writedowns are called for.  That analysis is underway, but it will not be complete for some time.   Osprey contains the European power projects (Trakya and Saarlux), some North American merchant investments, and some Brazilian assets.   Under the merger agreement, Enron cannot dispose of assets representing more than 15% of the balance sheet without Dynegy approval.  However, an appendix to the agreement holds a list of assets that are specifically permitted to be sold without Dynegy approval.   Broadband is expected to be fully wound up 'sometime over the course of the next year'.  (Did not catch this part clearly).   The ENE topup obligation for Marlin (represented by ENE common that would have to be delivered) will be converted into an obligation for an equivalent amount of DYN shares upon closing.   $1.9Bn of debt is carried at the Azurix level.   Current book value of the Osprey assets is $2.1Bn.   No Dynegy outs other than the previously discussed general MAC clause and the $3.5Bn legal liability clause.   Yosemite and the Credit-Linked notes are functionally equivalent to ENE senior unsecured debt (this section somewhat unclear).  The underlying transactions represented volumes of 'crude oil and gas'.  The transactions relate to the 'physical movement' of these commodities.  The swaps related to Yosemite and the CLNs would be financially settled.   Whalley was asked about the return of trading business to normal volumes.  He said that he cannot yet give an update on the progress of customers returning to our longer-term products.  Acknowledges that a few anxious customers put long-term deals on hold last week.  Says that our first focus is on getting our short-term business back up to normal levels.  It will be 'a couple of weeks' before we're able to give an update on the comfort levels of our customers regarding long-term deals with us.   McMahon:  There hasn't been a major relaxation of credit requirements by our customers--credit requirements continue to follow strict contractual provisions as called for in our individual agreements with our various customers.  But 'we have seen a return of some of the transactions, some of the flows.' Whalley says that we're hoping to see a return to more normal trading levels late this week or early next week. Lay says that cost cuts will be made across of all of our businesses.  The situation gives us an opportunity to review our entire cost structure, he says.  The cuts will certainly be deeper in our non-core businesses.  Whalley then quickly interjects (some might say interrrupts) with a clarification that there are no plans to reduce the size of our North American energy trading business.  We will be looking at, perhaps, streamlining some of our processes and making prudent adjustments, but there are no plans to reduce the size of the business. McMahon:  ""The company is overlevered; that's a fact.""--hence our pursuit of additional equity. McMahon mentions that business was better at the start of this week than at the end of last week. ENE had approx. $1Bn in cash as of 9/30, which McMahon points out would be unusual for us.    As before, give me a call at 3-3055 if you'd like more color.

Charlie Garner will once again be Oakland's feature back. Zack Crockett = may be used in goal-line situations.  Frank Wycheck , TE TEN - Matty Update= d 11/16/01 According to published reports, Wycheck is expected to play half=  of Sunday's game against Cincinnati. That makes him a risky start from a F= antasy perspective.  Steve McNair , QB TEN - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01 Mc= Nair's status is still in question for Sunday's game against Cincinnati due=  to an injured right thumb. He threw the ball during individual drills Frid= ay, and according to published reports, is likely to play despite not being=  100 percent. We don't recommend McNair this week as a result.  Emmitt Smit= h , RB DAL - Bass/Hull Updated 11/16/01 Smith will return to the lineup Sun= day against Philadelphia after missing two games with a sprained right knee= . Cowboys Head Coach Dave Campo said after Friday's practice that Smith wou= ld ""be ready to play the majority of the game."" His return bumps Troy Hambr= ick to fullback, but we wouldn't recommend you use either back against the = stingy Eagles rush defense.  Frank Sanders , WR ARI - Free Agent Updated 11= /16/01 Sanders (hamstring) was added to the NFL injury report on Friday and=  is now listed as questionable for Sunday's game against Detroit.  However,=  if you're completely desperate for a wideout in a larger league this week,=  Sanders' matchup against a vulnerable Detroit secondary is worth consideri= ng as long as he's able to play.    Chris Weinke , QB CAR - Tori Updated 11= /16/01 According to published reports, Weinke will be the starting quarterb= ack for Sunday's game against San Francisco. However, he's not worth starti= ng on your Fantasy team.   Daunte Culpepper , QB MIN - Giggles Updated 11/1= 6/01 Culpepper is one pace for a good Fantasy season despite the lack of co= nsistency in Minnesota's offense this season. He's one of the better quarte= rbacks in the league from a Fantasy perspective, and should be in your star= ting lineup on a weekly basis.   Cris Carter , WR MIN - Tori Updated 11/16/= 01 Carter's numbers may be down somewhat this season, but he's still too go= od to ever consider benching. The veteran has a knack for finding the end z= one, and should have a good game against rookie CB Will Allen and the Giant= s' secondary on Monday night.   Randy Moss , WR MIN - Russell Updated 11/16= /01 Moss is listed as probable for Monday's game against the N.Y. Giants du= e to an ankle injury. He's been underachieving this season, but it's almost=  impossible to bench him based on his potential to post solid Fantasy nu! m= b! ers.   Ricky Williams , RB NO - Bass/Hull Updated 11/16/01 Williams is o= ne of the better Fantasy backs in the league, and is a good player to use o= n a weekly basis. He'll face an Indianapolis defense that has been underach= ieving all season long, so Williams is a must-start.     Aaron Brooks , QB = NO - Matty Updated 11/16/01 Brooks had a big game against San Francisco las= t weekend, throwing for 347 yards and two scores. He may be a bit inconsist= ent this season, but his potential to post huge numbers makes it tough to b= ench him, especially against a vulnerable Indianapolis defense.    Willie J= ackson , WR NO - Martin Updated 11/16/01 Jackson put up a huge game against=  San Francisco last weekend, posting 11 catches and 167 yards receiving. He= 'll face a questionable Indianapolis squad that is vulnerable to the pass i= n Week 10, so starting Jackson this week is a solid option.   Stephen Davis=  , RB WAS - Bass/Hull Upda! te! d 11/16/01 Davis has stepped up his play af= ter beginning the season slowly. He's averaged 112 yards rushing over his l= ast four games, and is once again emerging as a reliable Fantasy player. Gi= ve him the start in Week 10 against a Denver defense that is vulnerable to = high scoring games.   Tony Banks , QB WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01 Ban= ks has played well of late, throwing five touchdowns in his last three game= s. He's got a good matchup this weekend against a Denver team that can be b= eaten through the air, but he's only worth considering in very deep Fantasy=  leagues.   Michael Westbrook , WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01 Westbr= ook has been inconsistent this season, but he has caught three touchdown pa= sses in his last four games. He'll face a Denver secondary this weekend tha= t is vulnerable at best, so starting him in deeper leagues is worth conside= ring.   Rod Gardner , WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01 Gardner has been=  held in check in his last two games, catching only three passes for 38 yar= ds. He does have a favorable matchup this weekend against Denver, however, = so starting him is a good move.   ! Az-Zahir Hakim , WR STL - Neal/McKay Up= dated 11/16/01 Hakim has been inconsistent in recent weeks, so starting him=  on your Fantasy team is a gamble unless the matchup is right. He'll go up = against a tough New England secondary in Week Ten, so avoid using him outsi= de of deeper leagues.   Torry Holt , WR STL - Tori Updated 11/16/01 Holt co= ntinues to put up consistent yardage totals, but he's only scored only thre= e touchdowns this season. He'll face a tough New England secondary this wee= kend, but he's still worth starting on your Fantasy team based on his poten= tial to put up solid numbers.   Isaac Bruce , WR STL - Frank Updated 11/16/= 01 Bruce hasn't put up the huge Fantasy totals this season, but he's still = one of the better wideouts in the league. He'll face CB Ty Law and the form= idable New England secondary, but he's still worth starting based on his po= tential for big numbers.   Marshall Faulk , RB STL - Matty Updated 11/16/01=  Faulk had a huge game against Carolina, proving that he is still the best = Fantasy player in the league. He's a must-start every week, and should post=  solid numbers in Week 10 against New England.   Ernie Conwell, TE STL - Fr= ee Agent Updated 11/16/01 Conwell has had a few down weeks, so starting him=  on your Fantasy team is somewhat of a gamble. With the lack of depth at ti= ght end around the league, however, starting Conwell is something many Fant= asy owners will have no choice but to do.   Richard Huntley , RB CAR - Russ= ell Updated 11/16/01 Huntley will be the likely starter this weekend agains= t San Francisco, but don't be surprised if he splits carries with Nick Goin= gs. Avoid starting either back in Week 10 if at all possible.   Donald Haye= s , WR CAR - Martin Updated 11/16/01 Hayes had only two catches for 11 yard= s last weekend against St. Louis. He's been unreliable for Fantasy owners t= his season, so starting him is a real gamble.    Wesley Walls , TE CAR - Fr= ee Agent Updated 11/16/01 Walls has been held in check over the last three = weeks, but he's still one of the better tight ends in the league. He's had = some success against San Francisco in the past, so starting him is advisabl= e.   Muhsin Muhammad , WR CAR - Martin Updated 11/16/01 Muhammad finally ha= d a somewhat productive game, catching six passes for 75 yards against St. = Louis. He's had some success in the past against this week's opponent, San = Francisco, so starting him is a decent move.   Brett Favre , QB GB - Frank = Updated 11/16/01 Favre has been one of the best Fantasy quarterbacks in the=  league this season. He'll face an Atlanta team on Sunday with a very vulne= rable secondary, so be sure to start Favre this week.   Bubba Franks , TE G= B - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01 Franks may not put up huge yardage numbers,=  but his seven touchdowns in eight games makes him a valuable Fantasy playe= r. Unless you have a better option on your roster, Franks is the type of ti= ght end that should start on a weekly basis.    Bill Schroeder , WR GB - Fr= ank Updated 11/16/01 Schroeder (ankle) is not listed on the NFL injury repo= rt, and is expected to start on Sunday against Atlanta. He's a solid play t= his week against Atlanta, whose secondary is vulnerable to strong passing t= eams like Green Bay.   Reuben Droughns , RB DET - Free Agent Updated 11/16/= 01 Droughns will likely split time with Lamont Warren in Detroit's backfiel= d this weekend in James Stewart's absence. Neither back has much Fantasy va= lue outside of deeper leagues, and starting them is a huge gamble.   Lamont=  Warren , RB DET - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01 Warren will likely start in = place of the injured James Stewart on Sunday against Arizona. He's split ca= rries with Reuben Droughns, and is only worth starting as a last resort in = larger Fantasy leagues.

" [IMAGE] Fantasy Football Newsletter    November 16, 2001              [IMAGE]Fantasy Sports     [IMAGE]Fantasy Football     [IMAGE]CBS SportsLine.com         Welcome to another edition of the 2001 Fantasy Football Newsletter!      The Fantasy Football newsletter will arrive in your e-mail inbox every Friday. We'll include news about the web site; tips on using all the features available; and answers to your player-related questions from the ""Gridiron Guru.""    [IMAGE] Inside      ? Plan for the Playoffs   ? Game-by-Game Analysis   ? Gridiron Guru   ? Tip of the Week        [IMAGE]  [IMAGE]  [IMAGE]          Plan for the Playoffs     The Fantasy season is nearing its end, and the playoffs are on the horizon. For Fantasy 2001 players, the playoffs begin with NFL week 15 (games of Dec. 22-23) and last two weeks, with the championship game in week 16 (games of Dec. 29-30.)  If you're in a Football Commissioner league, go to Schedule, Playoffs to see when your playoffs start and how many rounds they last. Of course, the matchups are probably still not determined, so you may not see teams listed in the brackets. The commissioner of your league is responsible for adding the teams to your playoff brackets at the end of your regular season.  If your team is still in contention, go to NFL Teams, Schedule and take note of the NFL teams with byes during your playoff weeks, so you know which players will be available if - and WHEN - your team competes in a playoff matchup.          Game-by-Game Analysis     Go to Players, Game Log to see how a particular player did in each game this season. The player's statistics in the common categories will be displayed for each game. If you are breaking down free agents, the game log is great way to see who's been getting the most consistent production.          Gridiron Guru     Welcome to Gridiron Guru, where we'll answer your questions about players and offer Fantasy Football roster advice. We invite you to send your own scouting reports and comments on players to: gridguru@commissioner.com . You'll get the chance to be heard by thousands of Fantasy players just like yourself!         Question - Mike Blake     I'm having trouble filling my No. 2 WR spot. Should I start Az-Zahir Hakim, Todd Pinkston or Muhsin Muhammad in week ten?    Answer - GG     Hakim is a hit-or-miss type, so he's risky. Pinkston has done nothing in his last four games, and he's losing playing time to Freddie Mitchell. Muhammad bounced back from a few bad performances to catch six passes for 75 yards last weekend against St. Louis, and has had some past success against this week's opponent, San Francisco. Go with Muhammad.        Question - Russell Brown     My league starts 2 QBs. Donovan McNabb is one  of my starters. Who else should I start? I have Tom Brady,  Vinny Testaverde and Doug Flutie.    Answer - GG     Testaverde's Fantasy value has taken a real hit this  season because of the Jets' conservative offense. Flutie  struggled last week against a bad Denver secondary, and  won't have an easier time against Oakland. We'd suggest  playing Brady, who will start against St. Louis despite the  return of Drew Bledsoe. Brady has thrown 11 touchdowns in  his last five games, and is playing too well to bench.         Question - Chris Gilcrest     Who would you start at QB this weekend: Rich  Gannon or Kerry Collins? Which one of these four RBs would  you bench: Eddie George, Michael Pittman, Mike Anderson,  Curtis Martin?     Answer - GG     Collins has the better matchup of the two QBs, but  he's far too inconsistent to start over a player like  Gannon. Oakland will be looking to bounce back from a subpar  performance against Seattle, so look for Gannon to have a  solid game. As for your second question, bench Mike  Anderson. You can't bench Martin, no matter how bad the  matchup may be. George has four touchdowns in his last three  games against Cincinnati, and is worth starting despite his  struggles this season; and Pittman's matchup against Detroit  is too good to ignore.           Tip of the Week      Keith Simmons, Boulder, CO: Can Terrell Davis ever stay  healthy? He comes back and teases Fantasy owners with his  solid play over the last two weeks, only to fall prey to  another knee injury this past Sunday. He was once the best  Fantasy player in the league, but now Davis is an  unreliable, injury-prone shell of his former self.

Terance Mathis , WR ATL - Frank Upd= ated 11/19/01 Mathis has by far his best game of the season, catching seven=  passes for 70 yards against Green Bay. He suffered a mild concussion in th= e game, but he's expected to be fine for this weekend's contest at Carolina= .   Jackie Harris , TE DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/19/01 Harris suffered a = strained right hamstring during Sunday's game against Philadelphia. He did = not return to the contest, and is listed as day to day.   Frank Sanders , W= R ARI - Free Agent Updated 11/19/01 Sanders had a huge game against Detroit=  on Sunday, catching seven passes for 127 yards and a touchdown. He injured=  his hamstring in the game, however, and is listed as day to day.   Quincy = Carter  , QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/19/01 Carter feels as though his h= amstring has healed enough that he's ready to return to action. However, th= e Cowboys will start Ryan Leaf for a few more weeks before Carter gets his = starting job back. The team wants to evaluate Leaf in a few games this seas= on to determine if he'll have any trade value in the offseason.   James Jac= kson , RB CLE - Hunter Updated 11/19/01 Jackson told the Cleveland Plain-De= aler it was a coach's decision not to use him against the Ravens. Jackson h= ad been suffering from an ankle injury, but reports prior to gametime had i= ndicated he might have been able to play. With the sudden emergence of Benj= amin Gay, Jackson's Fanta! sy! value might drop greatly.  Ryan Leaf , QB DA= L - Free Agent Updated 11/19/01 Leaf had another terrible outing this weeke= nd, but the Dallas Morning News is reporting that he'll remain the team's s= tarting quarterback for the time being. However, he's no better than waiver=  wire fodder in Fantasy Football.   Kevin Lockett , WR WAS - Free Agent Upd= ated 11/19/01 Lockett left Sunday's game against Denver in the first quarte= r due to a rib injury. His status for next week's game against Philadelphia=  is uncertain at this time. !  Tony Banks , QB WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/= 19/01 Banks, who suffered a concussion during Sunday's game against Denver,=  told the Washington Post that there's a ""definite possibility"" he would be=  ready in time for next weekend's game against Philadelphia. Kent Graham wo= uld start if Banks is unable to play, but neither QB is an attractive Fanta= sy option against the Eagles.   Emmitt Smith , RB DAL - Bass/Hull Updated 1= 1/19/01 Smith left Sunday's game against Philadelphia with a sprained knee.=  However, he is expected to be in the starting lineup when Dalla! s ! faces=  Denver on Thanksgiving Day.   Larry Foster , WR DET - Free Agent Updated 1= 1/19/01 Foster suffered an apparent leg injury during Sunday's game against=  Arizona. He is listed as day to day.  Desmond Howard , WR DET - Free Agent=  Updated 11/19/01 Howard suffered a shoulder injury during Sunday's win ove= r Arizona. He did not return to the game, and is listed as day to day.   Be= rt Emanuel! , WR DET - Free Agent Updated 11/19/01Emanuel suffered a knee i= njury during Sunday's game against Arizona. He is listed as day to day.  Mu= hsin Muhammad , WR CAR - Martin Updated 11/18/01 Muhammad sprained his left=  shoulder in Sunday's game against the 49ers. His status for the Week 11 ga= me against Atlanta is unclear.  Mike Anderson , RB DEN - Neal/McKay Updated=  11/18/01 Anderson rushed for only 31 yards on 13 carries against the Redsk= ins. Olandis Gary carried the ball 10! t! imes for 28 yards. It is apparent=  Anderson is no longer worthy of a starting spot on Fantasy teams, and Gary=  will continue to see some work at his expense.  Michael Westbrook , WR WAS=  - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01 Westbrook caught nine passes for 104 yards a= nd a TD at Denver. Opposing defenses are focusing on rookie Rod Gardner, an= d Westbrook is getting open often after starting the year slowly.  Jake Plu= mmer , QB ARI - Frank Updated 11/18/01 Plummer threw for 334 yards, four TD= s and was intercepted once by Detroit. Such stellar performances are rare f= or Plummer, who may not have a better game this season.  Michael Pittman , = RB ARI - Matty Updated 11/18/01 The awful Detroit defense limited Pittman t= o 81 rushing yards on 23 carries. Don't start Pittman in any upcoming weeks=  unless your team is very thin at RB..  David Sloan , TE DET - Free Agent U= pdated 11/18/01 Sloan caught two TD passes for a total of three yards at Ar= izona. If you are desperate for help at TE, consider Sloan! , ! who always = gets regular looks from Charlie Batch.  Lamont Warren , RB DET - Free Agent=  Updated 11/18/01 Warren rushed for 32 yards and a TD at Arizona and caught=  11 passes for 64 yards and a score. The Lions will continue to feature War= ren on third downs and near the goal line as a receiver, making him a good = Fantasy backup for the rest of the year.  Warrick Dunn , RB TB - Martin Upd= ated 11/18/01 Dunn caught 12 passes for 138 yards against the Bears, but he=  rushed for only 12 yards and fumbled twice. Don't count on Dunn for consis= tently good Fantasy numbers during the next few weeks. He can be explosive,=  but he is also erratic.  Keyshawn Johnson , WR TB - Giggles Updated 11/18/= 01 Johnson caught 12 passes for 89 yards against the Bears, but he failed t= o get in the end zone again. Don't depend on Johnson down the stretch unles= s your team is very thin at wideout.  David Terrell , WR CHI - Free Agent U= pdated 11/18/01 Terrell caught o! ne! pass for 15 yards at Tampa Bay. The r= ookie wideout is not consistent enough to start for most Fantasy teams.  Ma= rty Booker , WR CHI - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01 Booker caught seven passe= s for 165 yards and three TDs at Tampa Bay. In his third season, Booker has=  become a superb Fantasy wideout. He is a player you must start every week,=  no matter what matchup he faces.   Plaxico Burress , WR PIT - Free Agent U= pdated 11/18/01 The Jaguars limited Burress to one catch for 13 yards. The = second-year receiver has still not proven he can be a reliable Fantasy play= er.  LaDainian Tomlinson , RB SD - Hunter Updated 11/18/01 Tomlinson put up=  decent rushing numbers against Oakland, posting 68 yards and a touchdown. = His overall statistics have been down in recent weeks, however, which may h= ave something to do with the fact that he held out for the entire preseason= .   Hines Ward , WR PIT - Tori Updated 11/18/01 Ward caught nine passes for=  112 yards and a TD against Jacks! on! ville. While he doesn't score often,=  Ward has become a very solid receiver for Pittsburgh this year, and he wil= l always post respectable totals.  Doug Flutie , QB SD - Russell Updated 11= /18/01 Flutie's recent struggles continued against Oakland, throwing for on= ly 98 yards on Sunday. Unless he faces a good matchup, starting Flutie is b= ecoming somewhat of a gamble.   Stacey Mack , RB JAC - Hunter Updated 11/18= /01 Mack was held to six rushing yards on eight carries at Pittsburgh. He h= as not been a reliable back for the Jaguars or Fantasy owners this season. =  Rich Gannon , QB OAK - Martin Updated 11/18/01 Gannon had a solid outing a= gainst San Diego, throwing for 311 yards and four touchdowns. He's one of t= he top five Fantasy quarterbacks in the league and is a must-start every we= ek.

" Scott,  Did you have any success talking to Williams ?  Regards, Ellen x54099  -----Original Message----- From:  Wallumrod, Ellen   Sent: Friday, October 26, 2001 5:00 PM To: Neal, Scott Subject: Williams Physical Gas Master  Scott,  As discussed yesterday we really appreciate your help in moving the negotiations along for the Master with Williams Energy Marketing & Trading Company.  Just to give you some facts: We do have a GISB with Williams, of which they are the Confirming Party. Williams has made a decision not to confirm any deals less than a month in term, this is breach of contract. We currently have over 800 deals pending execution as they are not sending paper.   We have been unsuccessful for several months and the hold-up seems to be with Williams Legal group. Their Credit group is in favor of this Master as I understand it. Below are the several people we have been in contact with over the last several months.  Credit: Trey Skelton @ 918-573-5662 and Tim Neuman @ 918-573-4880 Legal:  Kelly Knowlton @ 918-573-5278  Debra Perlingiere in ENA Legal is handling the negotiations on our side and can be reached at 713-853-7658.

He is not expected to re= turn for another two to three weeks, meaning Shaun Alexander will continue = to be a key performer for many Fantasy teams as the postseason comes into v= iew.  Doug Flutie , QB SD - Russell Updated 11/20/01 Mike Riley told the Sa= n Diego Union-Tribune there is no QB controversy involving Flut! ie! and ro= okie Drew Brees. ""Doug is going to be our quarterback,"" he said. ""You can t= alk about controversy all you want, but there is none within this building.=  He is our quarterback. He will start. He will get us the next win the next=  week."" Still, Flutie is not playing well enought to satisfy most Fantasy o= wners.  Mark Bruener , TE PIT - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 Bruener will mi= ss the rest of the season after undergoing shoulder injury. His loss may ad= versely affect Jerome Bettis' statistics, because Bruener is widely regarde= d as the best run-blocking tight end in football.  Tyrone Wheatley , RB OAK=  - G! ig! gles Updated 11/20/01 Wheatley told the Contra-Costa Times he is = no longer being bothered by a knee injury. He expects to play on Sunday.  E= rron Kinney , TE TEN - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 Kinney (calf) may play t= his week after missing three games. He was expected to return to practice e= arly this week.  Frank Wycheck , TE TEN - Matty Updated 11/20/01 Wycheck (c= alf) will be limited in practice this week. He may be a risky start in Week=  11.  Steve McNair , QB TEN - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 The Tennessean sa= ys McNair's hand was sore when he arrived at the team's practice facility o= n Monday. Jeff Fisher now says he doesn't expect him to miss any practice t= ime this week.   Derrick Alexander , WR KC - JWillie Updated 11/20/01 Alexa= nder (ribs) has returned to practice. He is expected to start against Seatt= le.  Marvin Minnis , WR KC - Free Agent Up! da! ted 11/20/01  Minnis (ankle= ) is listed as doubtful for Sunday's game. Larry Parker may have to start i= n his place,  Mark Brunell , QB JAC - JWillie Updated 11/20/01 Brunell (qua= driceps) might miss Sunday's game against Baltimore. Jonathan Quinn will st= art again if Brunell can't play.  Mark Brunell , QB JAC - JWillie Updated 1= 1/20/01 Brunell (quadriceps) might miss Sunday's game against Baltimore. Jo= nathan Quinn will start again if Brunell can't play.  Reggie Wayne , WR IND=  - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 Wayne has a sprained knee ligament, and is d= oubtful for Sunday's game against New Orleans. Terrence Wilkins may have to=  start in his place.  Jerome Pathon , WR IND - Tori Updated 11/20/01 Pathon=  (foot) is done for the season. He will be put on injured reserve. Reggie W= ayne (knee) is also hurting, meaning Terrence Wilkins might have to be move= d back into the starting lineup.   Jay Fiedler  , QB MIA - Tori Updated 11/= 20/01 Dave Wannstedt told the Miami Herald there is no QB controversy surro= unding Fielder and backup Ray right now. ``That's kind of hypothetical,'' h= e said. ``Jay is the starter, and my only comment is we're going to get it = squared away and play turnover-free football.''  Rod Smith , WR DEN - Matty=  Updated 11/20/01 Mike Shanahan said he does not know if Smith (ankle) will=  be sufficiently healed to play in Thursday's game against the Cowboys. ""We= 'll get a chance to evaluate that during the week and see,"" Shanahan told t= he Denver Post. ""If he can help our football team, he'll play. If he's in a=  situation where he can't perform at the level that we think! c! an help ou= r team, then we'll keep him out and put somebody else in.""   Benjamin Gay ,=  RB CLE - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 The Cleveland Plain-Dealer says Butch=  Davis won't indicate how much Gay will play in the near future. ""We'll try=  to get him involved in some of the games,"" Davis said. ""We'll see.""   Kevi= n Lockett , WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 Lockett, who suffered a ri= b injury last weekend against Denver, expects to play on Sunday against Phi= ladelphia. However, the wide receiver has no real value as a Fantasy player=  at this point.   Tony Banks , QB WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 Barring=  any setbacks, Banks will start Sunday's game against Philadelphia. Banks, = who suffered a concussion last weekend vs. Denver, hasn't been feeling any = after effects of the injury and should be under center for the 'Skins.   Ja= cquez Green , WR TB - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 Green (abdomen) is! e! xp= ected to return to practice on Wednesday at full strength. He's been incons= istent this season, and is best used when the matchup is favorable.   Terre= ll Owens , WR SF - Martin Updated 11/20/01 Owens suffered a sprained left k= nee and ankle during the overtime session of last weekend's game against Ca= rolina. The injuries aren't considered serious, however, and Owens is expec= ted to be in the starting lineup on Sunday Indianapolis.   Cecil Martin , R= B PHI - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 Martin suffered a hamstring injury duri= ng Sunday's game against Dallas. He'll miss a few days of practice, but is = expected to play in this weekend's game against Washington. Martin has no r= eal value as a Fantasy player at this point.    Giants , DT NYG - Matty Upd= ated 11/20/01 According to the New York Post, cornerback Jason Sehorn's sur= gically-repaired right knee began giving him problems again this past weeke= nd. In fact, the team was unsure that he'd be able to cover either Randy Mo= ss or Cris Carter on Monday night, but he played anyway. If he continues to=  play on a bad wheel, you should consider starting any receivers opposing S= ehorn the rest of the season.   Elvis Grbac , QB BAL - Free Agent Updated 1= 1/20/01 The Baltimore Sun says there is no indication that Grbac will be re= placed as the team's starting QB. Still, he is not performing well enough t= o start for most Fantasy teams.  Donald Driver , WR GB - Free Agent Updated=  11/20/01 Driver is still dealing with a thigh injury, and is expected to m= iss Thursday's game against Detroit. The reserve wideout has no real value = as a Fantasy player at this point.    Ravens , DT BAL - Ru! ss! ell Updated=  11/20/01 Defensive end Michael McCrary will miss the rest of the season af= ter undergoing knee surgery. His loss will certainly lower the sack output = of the Baltimore defense and may mean the team will allow more passing yard= age than usual.    Cowboys , DT DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 Linebacke= r Dexter Coakley, who was expected to miss two weeks due to a sprained knee= , will likely get the start on Thursday after being out for just one game. = He'll help keep Denver's running game in check, but don't expect his presen= ce to give Dallas' defense added Fantasy value as a whole.   Emmitt Smith ,=  RB DAL - Bass/Hull Updated 11/20/01 Smith (knee) will start on Thursday's = game against Denver. ""I'm not 100 percent, but I'm healthy enough to do my = job,"" Smith told the Dallas Morning Star. He'll struggle to post solid Fant= asy numbers due to Dallas' horrid passing game, so bench him this week if a= t all possible.     Donald Hayes , WR CAR - Martin Updated 11/20/01 Hayes s= uffered bruised ribs during Sunday's game against San Francisco. He may mis= s some practice time this week, but he's expected to play this weekend agai= nst Atlanta. The Falcons secondary is one of the worst in the league, so Ha= yes could turn into a good sleeper pick in Week 1! 1.!   Terry Hardy , TE A= RI - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 Hardy is expected to return to practice th= is week after missing three games due to shoulder injury. However, he is no= t certain to play on Sunday against San Diego.   Jackie Harris , TE DAL - F= ree Agent Updated 11/20/01 Harris is out for Thursday's game against Denver=  due to a hamstring injury. Harris has been an unreliable Fantasy player an= d is only worth a roster spot in deeper leagues.   More Updates  [IMAGE]  C= opyright 2001 Commissioner.COM Inc and SportsLine.com Inc.

To customi= ze, reschedule, or turn off these reports please  click here    NFL Reports= , Player Updates  [IMAGE]Latest NFL Player News  Tony Martin , WR ATL - Fre= e Agent Updated 11/21/01 Martin hasn't been a reliable Fantasy player at al= l this season, but he could have a decent outing against Carolina. The Pant= hers secondary is one of the worst in the league, so starting Martin in dee= per Fantasy leagues may be worth considering.   Frank Sanders , WR ARI - Fr= ee Agent Updated 11/21/01 Sanders is dealing with two tight hamstrings, but=  he's expected to play on Sunday against San Diego. The Chargers' secondary=  h! as! n't been playing well of late, so giving Sanders some consideration=  in deeper leagues is advisable.   David Boston , WR ARI - Bass/Hull Update= d 11/21/01 Boston has become one of the premier wide receivers in Fantasy F= ootball. He's posted three touchdowns and 217 yards receiving in his last t= wo games, and should have another solid game vs. San Diego in Week 11.   To= m Brady , QB NE - Martin Updated 11/21/01 Patriots Head Coach Bill Belichic= k announced late Monday that Brady will remain the starting quarterback for=  the remainder of the season, barring injury. This relegates Drew Bledsoe t= o a backup role and makes him useless from a Fantasy perspective. Brady mig= ht have his hands full passing against the Saints on Sunday, but he is a fa= irly safe weekly starter otherwise.   Dolphins , DT MIA - Martin Updated 11= /21/01 Defensive tackle Daryl Gardener could miss the remainder of the seas= on due to a fragmented disc in his back. He will miss at least one month to=  rest and rehabilitate the injury before being re-evaluated. Gardener's abs= ence hurts the Dolphins' rush defense, which might be burned a little more = by opposing running backs in the upcoming weeks. Marvin Minnis , WR KC - Fr= ee Agent Updated 11/21/01 Minnis is unlikely to be available for Sunday's g= ame against Seattle due to the sprained ankle he suffered during a Nov. 11 = game against the Jets. He will be replaced by Chris Thomas in the lineup at=  split end, and you should keep him reserved for this week.  Mark Brunell ,=  QB JAC - JWillie Updated 11/21/01 Brunell's nagging leg injury might sidel= ine him for Sunday's game against Baltimore. He decided about two hours bef= ore last Sunday's kickoff that he couldn't play against Pittsburgh due to a=  strained right quadriceps. Jonathan Quinn has been preparing as if he will=  start the game, so right now you shouldn't count on Brunell this week as y= ou set your lineups.  Fred Taylor , RB JAC - Martin Updated 11/21/01 Taylor=  received a second medical opinion Tuesday that indicated his severe groin = injury could keep him out up to three months and possibly the remainder of = the season, according to the Florida Times-Union. The diagnosis was that th= e injury still has not healed and will need more time to become healthy, an= d in the meantime Taylor has developed pain ! in! his hip, a side effect of=  the injury. It's sounding more and more like Taylor will not play again th= is Fantasy season, although you should probably hold onto him until a final=  decision is reached, provided you have a deep enough bench.  Rod Smith , W= R DEN - Matty Updated 11/21/01 Smith's sprained ankle was not healed enough=  for him to practice on Tuesday, and there is a real chance he might miss T= hursday's game against Dallas. He suffered the injury Nov. 11, and aggravat= ed it during Sunday's game. You should probably play it safe and keep Smith=  on your bench for this week. Temper your expectations for the entire Bronc= os' offense as well - the Cowboys' D isn't the pushover many believed it wo= uld be prior to the season.  Shaun Alexander , RB SEA - JWillie Updated 11/= 20/01 With Ricky Watters expected to miss another two to three weeks, Alexa= nder will remain the focal point of many contending Fantasy teams during th= eir charge to the playoffs. He should roll up some fine numbers against the=  Chiefs this week.  Tom Brady , QB NE - Martin Updated 11/20/01 The Patriot= s will stick with Brady for now, and Drew Bledsoe will remain the team's No= . 2 QB. ""I don't see any changes this week,"" coach Bill Belichick said. Bra= dy is a solid Fantasy starter right now, but add Bledsoe to your ! ro! ster=  as an insurance policy if you can.  Jonathan Quinn , QB JAC - Free Agent U= pdated 11/20/01 Quinn may have to start in place of Mark Brunell (quadricep= s) again this week. Brunell's status is still unclear for Sunday's game.  R= icky Watters , RB SEA - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 Watters' shoulder has n= ot sufficiently healed enough for him to practice, says the Seattle Times .=  He is not expected to return for another two to three weeks, meaning Shaun=  Alexander will continue to be a key performer for many Fantasy teams as th= e postseason comes into view.  Doug Flutie , QB SD - Russell Updated 11/20/= 01 Mike Riley told the San Diego Union-Tribune there is no QB controversy i= nvolving Flutie and rookie Drew Brees. ""Doug is going to be our quarterback= ,"" he said. ""You can talk about controversy all you want, but there is none=  within this building. He is our quarterback. He will start. He will get us=  the next win the next week."" Still, Flutie is not playing well enought to = satisfy most Fantasy owners.  Mark Bruener , TE PIT - Free Agent Updated 11= /20/01 Bruener will miss the rest of the season after undergoing shoulder i= njury. His loss may adversely affect Jerome Bettis' statistics, because Bru= ener is widely regarded as the best run-blocking tight end in football.  Ty= rone Wheatley , RB OAK - Giggles Updated 11/20/01 Wheatley told the Contra-= Costa Times he is no longer being bothered by a knee injury. He expects to = play on Sunday.  Erron Kinney , TE TEN - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01Kinney = (calf) may play this week after missing three games. He was expected to ret= urn to practice early this week.  Frank Wycheck , TE TEN - Matty Updated 11= /20/01 Wycheck (calf) will be limited in practice this week. He may be a ri= sky start in Week 11.  Steve McNair , QB TEN - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 = The Tennessean says McNair's hand was sore when he arrived at the team's pr= actice facility on Monday. Jeff Fisher now says he doesn't expect him to mi= ss any practice time this week.   Derrick Alexander , WR KC - JWillie Updat= ed 11/20/01 Alexander (ribs) has returned to practice. He is expected to st= art against Seattle.  Marvin Minnis , WR KC - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 M= innis (ankle) is listed as doubtful for Sunday's game. Larry Parker may hav= e to start in his place,  Reggie Wayne , WR IND - Free Agent Updated 11/20/= 01 Wayne has a sprained knee ligament, and is doubtful for Sunday's game ag= ainst New Orleans. Terrence Wilkins may have to start in his place.  Jerome=  Pathon , WR IND - Tori Updated 11/20/01 Pathon (foot) is done for the seas= on. He will be put on injured reserve. Reggie Wayne (knee) is also hurting,=  meaning Terrence Wilkins might have to be moved back into the starting lin= eup.   Jay Fiedler , QB MIA - Tori Updated 11/20/01 Dave Wannstedt told the=  Miami Herald there is no QB controversy surrounding Fielder and backup Ray=  right now. ``! Th! at's kind of hypothetical,'' he said. ``Jay is the star= ter, and my only comment is we're going to get it squared away and play tur= nover-free football.''  Rod Smith , WR DEN - Matty Updated 11/20/01 Mike Sh= anahan said he does not know if Smith (ankle) will be sufficiently healed t= o play in Thursday's game against the Cowboys. ""We'll get a chance to evalu= ate that during the week and see,"" Shanahan told the Denver Post. ""If he ca= n help our football team, he'll play. If he's in a situation where he can't=  perform at the level that we think can help our team, then we'll keep him = out and put somebody else in.""   Benjamin Gay  , RB CLE - Free Agent Update= d 11/20/01 The Cleveland Plain-Dealer says Butch Davis won't indicate how m= uch Gay will play in the near future. ""We'll try to get him involved in som= e of the games,"" Davis said. ""We'll see.""   Kevin Lockett , WR WAS - Free A= gent Updated 11/20/01 Lockett, who suffered a rib injury last weekend again= st Denver, expects to play on Sunday against Philadelphia. However, the wid= e receiver has no real value as a Fantasy player at this point.   Tony Bank= s , QB WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 Barring any setbacks, Banks will s= tart Sunday's game against Philadelphia. Banks, who suffered a concussion l= ast weekend vs. Denver, hasn't been feeling any after effects of the injury=  and should be under center for the 'Skins.   Jacquez Green , WR TB - Free = Agent Updated 11/20/01 Green (abdomen) is expected to return to practice on=  Wednesday at full strength. He's been inconsistent this season, and is bes= t used when the matchup is favorable.   Terrell Owens , WR SF - Martin Upda= ted 11/20/01  Owens suffered a sprained left knee and ankle during the over= time session of last weekend's game against Carolina. The injuries aren't c= onsidered serious, however, and Owens is expected to be in the starting lin= eup on Sunday Indianapolis.

If you could contact him or direct him to the person that is in a position to help it would be appreciated.

To customi= ze, reschedule, or turn off these reports please  click here    NFL Reports= , Player Updates  [IMAGE]Latest NFL Player News  Keenan McCardell , WR JAC = - Neal/McKay Updated 11/25/01 McCardell caught six passes for 80 yards agai= nst Baltimore. He has certainly raised the level of his play in recent week= s, and should be a solid Fantasy player down the stretch as opponents conti= nue to focus on Jimmy Smith.  Stacey Mack , RB JAC - Hunter Updated 11/25/0= 1 Mack rushed for 50 yards and two TDs and caught five passes for 45 yards = against the Ravens. Despite his good outing, Mack remains a Fantasy risk be= ca! us! e of his inconsistency.   Qadry Ismail , WR BAL - Bass/Hull Updated=  11/25/01 The Jaguars held Ismail to three catches for 44 yards. Despite hi= s quiet statistical performance, Ismail remains a must-start player for any=  Fantasy team. He is one of the most complete and underrated receivers in t= he AFC.  Jason Brookins , RB BAL - Tori Updated 11/25/01 Brookins rushed fo= r 82 yards and two TDs at Jacksonville, but also lost a fumble. The rookie = RB is talented, but too erratic to be a Fantasy starter on most teams right=  now.  Ron Dayne , RB NYG - Neal/McKay Updated 11/25/01 Dayne carried the b= all six times for 26 yards against Oakland. Don't depend on him for good nu= mbers during the remainder of the season.  Tiki Barber , RB NYG - Neal/McKa= y Updated 11/25/01 Barber rushed for 124 yards and a TD against Oakland, an= d caught five passes for 41 yards. He has played well recently, although hi= s owners would still like to see him score on a more consistent basis.  LaD= ainian Tomlinson , RB SD - Hunter Updated 11/25/01 Tomlinson was held out o= f the end zone, but he had a good day against Arizona nonetheless. The rook= ie tailback had 145 scrimmage yards, including 13 receptions, in San Diego'= s 20-17 loss.   Doug Flutie , QB SD - Russell Updated 11/25/01 Flutie had a=  solid game, throwing for 308 yards and two touchdowns against Arizona. How= ever, he's only worth starting when the matchup is to his advantage.   Jake=  Plummer , QB ARI - Frank Updated 11/25/01Plummer had a decent outing on Su= nday, posting 241 yards and a touchdown against San Diego. Plummer, who als= o threw two picks, is only a reserve Fantasy quarterback at best.   David B= oston , WR ARI - Bass/Hull Updated 11/25/01 Boston had another outstanding = game, catching six passes for 121 yards and a touchdown against San Diego. = He's one of the most reliable Fantasy receivers in the league, and is worth=  starting on a weekly basis.   Willie Jackson , WR NO - Martin Updated 11/2= 5/01 Jackson had a ! go! od outing against New England, catching five catch= es for 78 yards and a touchdown. He may not be the most dependable Fantasy = receiver, but he is worth starting in deeper leagues.   Joe Horn , WR NO - = Matty Updated 11/25/01 Horn had another solid outing, catching four passes = for 97 yards against New England. He's been a very dependable receiver in r= ecent weeks and is worth starting on a weekly basis.  Tyrone Wheatley , RB = OAK - Giggles Updated 11/25/01 In his return from a knee injury, Wheatley c= arried the ball five times for 17 yards. Zack Crockett was used more often = in short-yardage packages, and Wheatley does not appear capable of starting=  for any Fantasy team in the near future. Even when he is fully healthy, he=  may not be able to take many carries away from Charlie Garner.  Antowain S= mith , RB NE - JWillie Updated 11/25/01 Smith had 153 yards of total offens= e and two touchdowns against New Orleans. After a slow start, Smith has bec= ome a pretty good weekly option for Fantasy Footballers  Tom Brady , QB NE = - Martin Updated 11/25/01 Brady put up huge numbers against New Orleans, po= sting 258 yards passing and four touchdowns. He's become a pretty reliable = Fantasy player, and his performance will likely keep Drew Bledsoe on the Pa= triots' bench for another week.  Rich Gannon , QB OAK - Martin Updated 11/2= 5/01 Gannon threw for 221 yards, three TDs and no interceptions against the=  Giants. He ignored rain-soaked conditions, and continued to look like the = most reliable QB in Fantasy Football.  Frank Sanders , WR ARI - Free Agent = Updated 11/25/01 Sanders left Sunday's game against San Diego after re-aggr= avating a hamstring injury. He was replaced by MarTay Jenkins, and did not = return to the game.  Eric Moulds , WR BUF - Bass/Hull Updated 11/25/01 Moul= ds finally emerged from an extended slump, catching six passes for 196 yard= s and two TDs against Miami. He also lost a fumble, and Fantasy owners shou= ld still remember that Moulds has been a disappointment for most of the yea= r. Don't be surprised if he follows his best outing of the year with a medi= ocre performance.  Alex Van Pelt , QB BUF - Free Agent Updated 11/25/01 Van=  Pelt had another fine game, throwing for 309 yards, three TDs and one inte= rception. He is definitely merits strong Fantasy consideration as long as h= e remains in Buffalo's starting lineup.  Oronde Gadsden , WR MIA - Matty Up= dated 11/25/01 Gadsden caught eight passes for 118 yards at Buffalo. He did=  not catch a TD pass, though, and lost a fumble. Gadsden is too unreliable = to start for most Fantasy teams in these important final weeks.  Jay Fiedle= r , QB MIA - Tori Updated 11/25/01 Fiedler threw for 262 yards, three TDs a= nd no interceptions at Buffalo. His performance may have quieted talk of a = QB controversy, but Fiedler is still too inconsistent to be a dependable Fa= ntasy QB.  Donovan McNabb , QB PHI - Russell Updated 11/25/01 The Redskins = held McNabb to 92 passing yards and 39 rushing yards, with no TDs or interc= eptions. Expect the Philadelphia QB to rebound quickly from such a quiet pe= rformance.  James Thrash , WR PHI - Frank Updated 11/25/01 Thrash caught fo= ur passes for 32 yards against Washington. He is too in! co! nsistent to be=  a starter on better Fantasy teams as the playoffs approach.   Rod Gardner = , WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/25/01 Gardner caught four passes for only = 33 yards on Sunday. The rookie has slowed down considerably in the past few=  weeks, and now seems like a risk during the Fantasy homestretch.   Ki-Jana=  Carter , RB WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/25/01 Carter saw extensive action = on Sunday as Stephen Davis played through back problems. He carried 18 time= s for 56 yards, and is a good backup to have if Davis in on your Fantasy te= am. Davis has always been known to battle minor injuries.  Isaac Byrd , WR = CAR - Free Agent Updated 11/25/01 Byrd started in place of the injured Muhs= in Muhammad on Sunday. He posted decent Fantasy numbers in Muhammad's absen= ce, catching five passes for 69 yards in Carolina's 10-7 loss to Atlanta.  =  Muhsin Muhammad , WR CAR - Martin Updated 11/25/01 Muhammad missed S! un! = day's game against Atlanta due to a shoulder injury. His status for next we= ekend's game against New Orleans is unknown at this time.   Derrick Alexand= er , WR KC - JWillie Updated 11/25/01 Alexander caught two passes for 56 ya= rds in his return from a rib injury. He was not open often, and Alexander m= ay continue to be a Fantasy disappointment if he stays healthy.  Chris Chan= dler , QB ATL - Free Agent Updated 11/25/01 Chandler had a subpar game on S= unday, throwing for only 132 yards against Carolina. The Falcons chose to a= ttack Carolina with their ground game, which was the reason for Chandler's = poor Fantasy numbers.   Derrick Alexander , WR KC - JWillie Updated 11/25/0= 1 Alexander caught two passes for 56 yards in his return from a rib injury.=  He was not open often, and Alexander may continue to be a Fantasy disappoi= ntment if he stays healthy.

He will be limited again in practice, and it's probably a good idea=  to keep him on reserve for Week 12 in your league.  Terrell Davis , RB DEN=  - JWillie Updated 11/27/01 Davis should be able to return from arthroscopi= c knee surgery in time for Sunday's game agains! t ! Miami. He will practic= e this week before a final decision is made, but we're skeptical the Bronco= s won't have him split carries with Mike Anderson, limiting both players' F= antasy values.  Keith Poole , WR DEN - Free Agent Updated 11/27/01 Poole ha= s bruised ribs that will likely keep him on the sidelines for Sunday's game=  against Miami. If he can't play, Kevin Kaspar would start in his place, an= d the Denver passing game would further suffer.  Rod Smith , WR DEN - Matty=  Updated 11/27/01 Smith now has two sprained ankles, and is questionable fo= r Sunday's game against Miami. If he can't play, then the Broncos might hav= e to start Kevin Kaspar and Chris Cole at wideout, depending on Keith Poole= 's recovery from a rib injury.  James Jackson , RB CLE - Hunter Updated 11/= 27/01 Jackson's ankle remains sore, and he will be re-evaluated Wednesday t= o determine his status for Sunday's game against Tennessee. Benjamin Gay an= d Jamel White would continue to split carries if Jackson can't go.  Neil Ra= ckers , K CIN - Free Agent Updated 11/27/01 Bengals Head Coach Dick LeBeau = said Monday he has not yet made a decision on the status of Rackers, who mi= ssed two field-goal chances Sunday. He is 9-for-18 in field goals this seas= on, and Jaret Holmes has been on the practice squad since Nov. 1. Rackers w= ill likely retain the job for Sunday's game against Tampa Bay, but he's a v= ery risky Fantasy starter based on his struggles.  Akili Smith , QB CIN - F= ree Agent Updated 11/27/01 Bengals Head Coach Dick LeBeau said Monday that = Smith might be promoted to No. 2 quarterback, according to The Cincinnati E= nquirer . ""If that's what they're going to do, maybe the Bengals need to ge= t rid of me,"" Smith said, citing a desire to be traded if he's used in a mo= p-up role. He's not a recommended Fantasy choice, although it's important t= o note that he's now likely next in line if Jon Kitna gets hurt.  Terry All= en , RB BAL - Tori Updated 11/27/01 Allen, who remains out with a broken ha= nd, could return to the lineup on Dec. 16. With the Ravens losing Jason Bro= okins to an injury, don't be surprised if Allen takes back the starting job=  once healthy. Hold onto him if you have the room on your reserve list or p= lay in a deeper league.  M! o! e Williams , RB BAL - Free Agent Updated 11/= 27/01 Williams becomes the Ravens' featured back after the injury to Jason = Brookins. If you play in a deeper league or are desperate for a running bac= k, consider picking up Williams, although you shouldn't expect him to post = great stats unless the matchup is very favorable.  Jason Brookins , RB BAL = - Tori Updated 11/27/01 Results of X-rays on Brookins' foot revealed a frac= ture of a bone in his small toe, which will sideline him for at least four = weeks and possibly the rest of the season. Moe Williams becomes the Ravens'=  starting running back, and might be worth adding to your roster in a deepe= r league.  Wayne Chrebet , WR NYJ - JWillie Updated 11/27/01 Chrebret did n= ot practice Monday because of a shoulder injury. However, The New York News= day reports that he is expected to play in Sunday's game.   Jake Arians , K=  BUF - Free Agent Updated 11/27/01 Arians has been released by the Bills. B= uffalo has signed Shayne Graham to replace him.   Edgerrin James , RB IND -=  JWillie Updated 11/2! 7/! 01 Colts coach Jim Mora said James' surgery to r= epair a torn ligament in his left knee was successful Saturday in Miami.  M= ora said he received the news from orthopedic surgeon Dr. Arthur Rettig, a = team physician. ""I spoke with him Saturday and he told me it went very well= ,"" Mora said. James, the two-time NFL rushing champion, injured the knee wh= en he was tackled awkwardly late in a game at Kansas City on Oct. 25. He wa= s placed on injured reserve last week. James' rehabilitation is expected to=  take seven months. He is not expected to take part in either of the Colts = offseason minicamps. Team president Bill Polian has not said whether James = will be ready for the start of training camp.     Terry Glenn , WR NE - Mat= ty Updated 11/27/01 Glenn could be put on injured reserve if he doesn't rec= over from a hamstring injury soon. That would mean the end of his season, a= nd perhaps the end of his Patriots career. ""I haven't reached it yet,"" coac= h Bill Belichick said Monday when asked when he would decide if the roster = spot would be better spent on someone other than Glenn. ""But as each day go= es by, it gets a little bit closer.""      Shayne Graham , K SEA - Free Agen= t Updated 11/27/01 The Buffalo Bills signed Graham as their kicker Tuesday,=  a day after Jake Arians was released following a missed point-after agains= t the Miami Dolphins. Graham had been released by the Seattle Seahawks befo= re the start of the season.   Stephen Alexander , TE WAS - Free Agent Updat= ed 11/27/01 Alexander, who has been hampered by a ankle injury, returned to=  action on Sunday. He didn't start, however, and may lose playing time to b= oth Walter Rasby and Zeron Flemister for the rest of the season. Unless you=  play in a deeper league, dropping Alexander is advisable.  Az-Zahir Hakim = , WR STL - Neal/McKay Updated 11/27/01 Hakim, who is dealing with an ankle = injury, played in Monday night's 24-17 loss to Tampa Bay. He had three catc= hes for 29 yards in the game.   Kevan Barlow , RB SF - Tori Updated 11/27/0= 1 Barlow suffered a dislocated shoulder during Sunday's win over Indianapol= is. ""It's throbbing,"" Barlow told the Contra Costa Times. ""I couldn't reall= y sleep last night. I had to sleep sitting up. It's hurting."" Barlow is lis= ted as doubtful for Sunday's game against Buffalo, so be sure to place him = on reserve.     Terrell Owens , WR SF - Martin Updated 11/27/01 Owens suffe= red a sprained right foot on Sunday to go along with his sprained left ankl= e. X-rays were negative, but Owens' foot was placed in a protec! ti! ve boo= t as a precaution. He is expected to miss some practice time this week, but=  he will be in the starting lineup on Sunday when the Niners face Buffalo. =   Jeff Thomason , TE PHI - Free Agent Updated 11/27/01 Thomason suffered a = hyperextended knee during Sunday's loss to Washington. He missed practice o= n Monday, and is status for Week 12 is uncertain at this time. The reserve = tight end has very little value as a Fantasy player.   Donald Driver , WR G= B - Free Agent Updated 11/27/01 Driver, who has been inactive for three str= aight weeks due to a thigh injury, returned to practice on Monday. His stat= us for Week 12 remains unclear, but he's not worth starting on your Fantasy=  team in any event.   Tyrone Davis , TE GB - Free Agent Updated 11/27/01 Da= vis, who has been out all year due to a hamstring injury, will likely find = out what his status with the Packers will be this week. Depending on his he= alth, the team will either activate him, place him on injured reserve or cu= t him altogehter.   James Stewart , RB DET - Hunter Updated 11/27/01 Stewar= t, who suffered a neck stinger in last Thursday's game against Green Bay, i= s expected to be available for Week 12. He'll have a tough time posting goo= d Fantasy numbers against Chicago's tough run defense, but the lack of dept= h at running back in the league makes it tough to bench him.   Charlie Batc= h , QB DET - Free Agent Updated 11/27/01 According to the Detroit Free Pres= s , Batch is expected to start Sunday's game against Chicago despite a groi= n injury. ""This is Charlie's offense,"" coach Marty Mornhinweg said. ""He pra= cticed a little bit today...he was in all weekend getting (the injury) trea= ted...I would expect him close to full speed Wednesday."" He'll likely lose = snaps to rookie QB Mike McMahon, however, so starting Batch is a risky prop= osition.   Jackie Harris , TE DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/27/01 Harris miss= ed last week's game against Denver due to a hamstring injury. The veteran t= ight end is listed as day to day.   Anthony Thomas , RB CHI - Martin Upda! = te! d 11/27/01 According to coach Dick Jaroun, Thomas' status for Week 12 i= s still uncertain. In fact, the Bears don't expect to know if Thomas, who i= s dealing with a hamstring injury, will be available until later in the wee= k.   Brad Hoover , RB CAR - Free Agent Updated 11/27/01 Hoover (neck) will = likely be held out of practice this week. However, the Panthers are hopeful=  that he'll be available for Sunday's game against New Orleans.   Chris Wei= nke , QB CAR - Tori Updated 11/27/01 Despite his inconsistent play and 14 i= nterceptions, Weinke's job as Carolina's No. 1 quarterback is secure. ""Ther= e've been quarterbacks who have gone on to be very successful that have gon= e through times like this,"" coach George Seifert told the Charlotte Observe= r. ""Even though there are a number of these plays that haven't turned out a= nd there have been disruptions in his play, I think, ultimately, it will be=  more beneficial than not."" While he may be the starting quarterback in Car= olina, Weinke isn't worth a roster spot in most Fantasy leagues.   Frank Sa= nders , WR ARI - Free Agent Updated 11/27/01 Sanders, who left Sunday's gam= e against San Diego due to nagging hamstring injuries, is questionable for = the Cards' Week 12 matchup at Oakland. However,! h! e is optimistic that he= 'll be available for the game. ""I'll be there,"" Sanders told the Arizona Re= public. ""They're just real sore from doing a lot of running and jumping - n= ormal wear and tear."" In any event, keeping Sanders on your bench may be a = good idea against the tough Oakland secondary.   Rob Moore , WR ARI - Marti= n Updated 11/27/01 Moore (hamstring) was supposed to begin some light runni= ng last week, but he ended up doing nothing of the sort. ""He hasn't made a = lot of progress,"" coach Dave McGinnis told the Arizona Republic. ""We're goi= ng to come to a point where we're going to have to make a decision."" Moore,=  who has missed the entire season due to injury, could be placed on the inj= ured reserve list this week.   More Updates [IMAGE]  Copyright 2001 Commiss= ioner.COM Inc and SportsLine.com Inc.

To: Cavemates  From: Bin Laden, Osama   Sent: Monday, December 10, 2001 8:17 AM   Subject: The Cave   Hi guys. We've all been putting in long hours in this conflict but we've finally come together as a group and I love that. Big thanks to Omar for putting up the poster that says ""There is no I in team"" as well as the one that says ""Hang In There, Baby."" That cat is hilarious. However, while we are fighting a jihad, we can't forget to take care of the cave. And frankly I have a few concerns.  First of all, while it's good to be concerned about cruise missiles, we should be even more concerned about the scorpions in our cave. Hey, you don't want to be stung and neither do I, so we need to sweep the cave daily.  I've posted a sign-up sheet near the main cave opening.  Second, it's not often I make a video address but when I do, I'm trying to scare the most powerful country on earth, okay? That means that while we're taping, please do not ride your razor scooter in the background. Just while we're taping. Thanks.  Third point, and this is a touchy one. As you know, by edict, we're not supposed to shave our beards. But I need everyone to just think hygiene, especially after mealtime. We're all in this together.  Fourth: food. I bought a box of Cheez-Its recently, clearly wrote ""Osama"" on the front, and put it on the top shelf. Today, my Cheez-Its were gone. Consideration. That's all I'm saying.  Finally, we've heard that there may be American soldiers in disguise trying to infiltrate our ranks. I want to set up patrols to look for them. First patrol will be Omar, Muhammed, Abdul, Akbar, and the new guy Richard.   Love you lots.   Osama B.

Credit, contract, timing and legal requirements are included for review.  Most actions and requests are determined by who the parent company is and how the credit check turns up. That also greatly impacts the turnaround time for service  for us to transact on the pipelines.  I have all hardcopies of necessary forms on my desk.  We can perform the same inquiry and request for the next batch of pipelines that trading identifies as second tier and necessary for trading as we expand.   Please let me know if you need additional information.

She wants details. On that note I need a status report from each desk on our effort to start the contract process for pipes, TPA's & EBB's so I can include that in the report. I have received some emails however I would like each manager to put together a summary in an Excel spreadsheet that we can have Suzanne consolidate with the stuff she already put together. Please cover the key items listed in the earlier email. Also we should be getting as much hard copy as possible so we can proceed with our goal of preparing for a startup. I suggest reviewing the paperwork and identify the stuff that you will need to get the forms completed. No doubt we will have substantial gaps but as long as we know where and what they are we can get the proper internal people involved (legal, credit, etc.)  Tks - Bob",frank.vickers@enron.com,scott.neal@enron.com,FW: Contract status needed,2002-01-07 08:38:09-08:00,sent

From Policy to Practice: Privacy Management Solutions (Customer Relationship Management/Customer Interaction Client Access) http://www.meridien-research.com/doc.asp?docid=819 This is the third Meridien report in a series that deals with privacy issues worldwide. Advanced technology has made customer data more mobile than ever. Financial institutions analyze, transmit, and store sensitive customer data every day to deliver products and services to their customers in an efficient and effective manner. But technological advancements have also created an environment in which financial institutions can sell customer data to third parties or inadequately protect customer information. Regulators may stipulate which data can be collected and how it can be used, but customers may have their own set of stipulations. It is up to the institution to balance these demands. This report defines privacy management and examines three vendors offering privacy management middleware solutions.  2. XML: Are We Speaking the Same Language? (Wholesale e-Financial Client Access) (Emerging Trading Technologies Client Access) (Retail e-Financial Client Access) http://www.meridien-research.com/doc.asp?docid=820  Technologists may not be uttering ""XML"" with quite the battle-cry zeal they did last year, but XML standardization efforts trudge on. XML remains a crucial consideration for organizations as they make their technology decisions. This report updates a previous Meridien report on XML, which focused largely on the business-to-business marketplace arena. Much of the immense market push in that direction has slowed along with the rest of the economy. In the meantime, belt-tightening and budget scrutiny are leading many institutions to pursue internal initiatives that can for now bring them more immediate and assured return on investment than might more outwardly focused, multi-institution efforts. This report updates some of the standardization efforts and provides some new coverage in an effort to shed light on the areas where the financial industry will more than likely focus in the next several years.  3. Buy-Side OMS: Several Steps Closer to STP (Emerging Trading Technologies Client Access) http://www.meridien-research.com/doc.asp?docid=823  Order management systems, or OMSs, facilitate the intrafirm processing of securities trading. The growth and acceptance of processing power and networking technologies have allowed OMSs to expand beyond simple order management. This growth has encouraged the centralization of several front-, middle-, and back-office and compliance functionalities into one solution. As straight-through processing becomes more important for firms, an OMS offers a relatively easy and proven way of starting down this road. This report examines the components of an OMS, various vendors providing OMS solutions, the OMS marketplace, and how a buy-side firm uses OMS technology.  4. Top Ten Strategic IT Initiatives in Wholesale Financial Services for 2002 (Guest access) http://www.meridien-research.com/misc/top10_2002.asp  Meridien Research's third annual IT analysis identifies the top ten initiatives that will have key strategic importance for the wholesale financial services industry in 2002. This special report summarizes and forecasts spending on these initiatives, considering industry segment and geographic region.  5.

By Joe Bob Briggs, a writer for UPI January 22, 2002 9:25 a.m.  Here's how Enron works. It's really quite simple. Ismail is a successful mule trader in Peshawar. Every year Ismail delivers 30 mules to the Kabul Mule Market and gets $40 per mule.  This year, however, the Khyber Pass is full of warlord militias, so Ismail is not sure he can drive his mules to market without losing a mule here and there. Also, the demand for mules in Kabul seems to be dropping. Maybe he'll only be able to sell 20 mules, or, God forbid, 15, and then be forced to feed and water the rest of them on a money-losing trek back home. In other words, it's a scary market and Ismail is worried about feeding his family.  What Ismail needs is to limit his risk with an Enron derivatives package. First he pays $2 per mule for a Khyber Pass Derivative, so that any mule killed or stolen by warlords will be reimbursed at the rate of $20 per mule-half the going market rate, but still better than taking a total loss. Next he buys Enron Mule Futures. For $28 per contract, he guarantees delivery of a mule in three months time. He takes 15 of these, figuring that a guaranteed $28 mule sale is better than showing up in Kabul and discovering that the mule buyers have been killed by stray bombs.  Meanwhile, at the Enron Mule Trading Desk in Houston, eagle-eyed yuppies are studying the worldwide mule markets and starting to have their doubts about those $28 delivery contracts. Mule use is dropping all over Afghanistan, even as the mule count is dwindling. Better resell eight of those 15 contracts to a European commodities broker for $24 each, then make up that $32 loss somewhere else while cutting the company's exposure in half. But how to hedge the risk on the other seven?  Aha! A blip on the computer screen. A temporary mule shortage in southern Iran! With a current mule price of $42 in Tehran, Enron could offer a Linked Mule Swap Double Derivative tied to the gap between the price of mules delivered in Kabul on a given date and the price in Tehran on the same date. Sure, you would rather have the quick-and-clean Iran sale, instead of the sale in Kabul that requires trucking the mules to a foreign market. But even if you add in $4 per mule for transport through militia-held territory and averaged the markets together, you can still clear eight bucks just on the gap alone.  Enron's average price-per-future-mule is now $32.57 when you include the $4-per-mule loss on the mule futures dumped in Europe. But based on the amazing $12 Kabul/Tehran trading gap, they can easily put together a ""delivery in either market"" contract that will allow them to ask $36 per mule on their Mule Online Internet trading system. The first mule future sells instantly for $36, and the price bobs up to $36.50. Two mules go for $36.75, and then there's a big jump for the last three mules to $37.90. Enron has now off-loaded all its price-based mule futures liability for a profit of $31.70.  But this doesn't mean they're out of the mule market in Central Asia. It's still two months until Ismail delivers his 30 mules, and Enron is on the hook for his Khyber Pass derivative insurance policy.  Things are not looking good in that part of the world, either. The chances of a mule being picked off as a road-passage tax are pretty high, and the loss of the whole herd would be a $600 liability. Quickly, the financial boys go to work, and part of that liability is resold to a consortium of Singapore banks, Australian mutual funds, and Saudi Arabian arms merchant Adnan Kashoggi, thereby reducing Enron's percentage to 25 percent, or $150 in potential liability against a $15 premium (remember the $2 per mule paid by Ismail), and Enron also takes a brokerage fee of $20 from the three other partners, thereby reducing its real liability to just $120.  But that's still too much of a spread, so Enron continues to hedge. Fortunately, the company has such a diversified trading floor that Enron mule-market experts can walk over to the traders in the warlord-militia derivatives department. Sure enough, at least four tribes near the Khyber Pass are increasingly concerned about profit margins. There simply aren't enough people to rob. Things have gotten so bad, in fact, that the warlords are hedging against the oncoming winter by taking futures positions in stolen chickens, stolen humanitarian aid trucks, and Western hostages. There's not a mule market yet, because the warlords have successfully converted many of the recalcitrant villagers into pack animals. But Enron knows how to MAKE markets.  Quickly the numbers-crunchers go to work, and they soon determine that the average number of stolen mules per 100-man militia is 1.4 per year. That represents anywhere from $28 to $56 in lost mule-thievery income if the Khyber Pass is closed or inhospitable to traders from Pakistan. Amortizing that amount over 12 months, the warlords have an exposure of anywhere from $2.33 to $4.67 per month in lost pillage. Hence Enron announces the new Highway Robbery Derivative, in which each tribe is guaranteed the value of two stolen mules in each 12-month period in return for paying a premium of $4 per month.  Enron's hedge is now complete, and it's a beautiful thing to behold. The chances of Ismail losing a mule to a raiding party are approximately one in 30, or 3.33 percent. Since he's paying $60 for his derivative contract, the expected loss of 3.33 percent of his herd would result in a payment of only $20 ? a more than comfortable spread. Meanwhile, if the mule is stolen by a warlord holding a Highway Robbery Derivative, then the payment to the other side would only be $28 against premiums of $48. If Ismail simply passes through the Khyber Pass without incident and sells all his mules at the standard price, Enron pockets $60 from Ismail and $48 each from four warlords, in addition to the previous profit of $31.70 from that heady Internet mule-futures trading day and the $20 in packaging commissions. If each warlord steals his standard 1.4 mules per year, then Enron still owes six-tenths of one mule to the warlord, or about $22.20 based on a $37 sale price.  Total expected profit, based on 5.6 stolen mules, one of which is stolen from Ismail: $143.20. Total profit from all Ismail-related mule transactions: $194.90. See, it's simple when you know how it works. Ask Arthur Andersen.

"********************************************** *** Make a note: Meridien's Annual Summit Conference will be in Cambridge, MA, on May 20-21, 2002!***  New at Meridien Research for January 30, 2002  1. Converting Policyholders into Customers: Insurance Agents Hold the Key 2. Integrated, Multichannel Service Systems 3. Risk Integration Services: Should We Order Out?

Converting Policyholders into Customers: Insurance Agents Hold the Key (Customer Relationship Management/Corporate Customer Management Client Access) http://www.meridien-research.com/doc.asp?docid=825  Financial services institutions process sensitive customer data to deliver products and services to customers in a more efficient and effective manner. New technologies have made this data extremely mobile and vulnerable to uses beyond that for which it was initially collected. Regulators may issue stipulations about the data that can be collected and how it can be used, but customers may have their own set of stipulations. It is up to the institution to balance their demands for privacy with its need for adequate data. Technology can help, but one must understand its limitations. This report defines privacy management and describes how privacy management middleware works.  2. Integrated, Multichannel Service Systems (Customer Relationship Management/Customer Interaction Client Access) http://www.meridien-research.com/doc.asp?docid=824  Financial service institutions today face a large, oftentimes bewildering, and rapidly evolving array of service constituencies and channels, each with its own service needs and expectations. Many vendors and some progressive institutions are moving to integrate these multichannel service systems to provide a single source of service information for use across different service channels. This early outlook report examines this still developing trend. It reviews the driving factors, identifies the principal service trends, presents a conceptual model for integrated service, explores success factors, and considers adoption patterns.  3. Risk Integration Services: Should We Order Out? (Risk Management Client Access) http://www.meridien-research.com/doc.asp?docid=827  Risk projects are complicated and high risk. Most financial services institutions do not have the staff to fulfill all of the required resources through all of a project's phases and will have to hire assistance from outside. There are new ways, however, to combine the resources of business and IT consultants, vendor-provided services, and in-house capacities to significantly reduce total project costs. Once an institution has a framework for evaluating the abilities and appropriateness of professional service providers and their risk services on offer, it can selectively purchase the expertise and experience it lacks. This report provides such a framework for decision-making, breaking the evaluation process down into phases that mirror the process of acquiring and implementing a financial risk management system.  **********************************************************   Meridien Research 2020 Commonwealth Avenue Newton, Massachusetts 02466 Tel: +1.617.796.2800 Fax: +1.617.796.2850 sales@meridien-research.com  Please do not reply to this e-mail.

Cc: Calcagno, Suzanne Subject: RE: how did your meeting w/ the lawyers go?  Hunter, the meeting went well. We met with Bryan Murtagh (UBS attorney) and did an overview of the contract services we are looking to set up with the pipes, how those are utilized and some of the underlying risks/exposure of using these contracts. Basically the message was these are non-negotiable contracts, he seemed to understand that and didn't indicate this would require any major legal review from their side. We also had a discussion about the credit requirements and what some of the pipes are asking for. Follow up credit meeting to take place today to get into some greater detail and get a standard credit package together. Also UBS did indicate that they also want to do a credit review of the pipes before moving forward. To faciltiate that we gave them a list of the Day 1 pipes to start their process.  In summary, I don't believe there will be any challenge on us entering into these agreements nor a lenghty review by the UBS attorneys. The credit issue is big, need to have them expedite their review of pipelines and also recognize our need to satisfy the pipeline credit requirments for a new customer (standard credit package and any addtional requirements). Also need some defintitive answers on when we can actually send this information out (is it now or is it when the deal closes). Suzanne is going to a legal meeting this AM to discuss/recap where everything is at this point in time. I will forward any additonal information to you when I get it. This assumes the Power of Attorney issue will be settled shortly for contract execution.  Bob      -----Original Message----- From:  Shively, Hunter S.

Scott   Sent: Monday, February 04, 2002 3:17 PM To: Neal, Scott Cc: Keiser, Kam Subject: update  Scott,  I just wanted to let you know what is going on down here.   1. I will give you a printout of what curves are in what curve files. Currently there are 2 basis files and 1 intramonth. If we need to split out certain curves to individual traders  and their markets, we can. I just need to know who will be doing what. I think the simplest way to do this is to write the trader's name above the curve name on the printout I give you and I can make the adjustments. I will give this printout to you tomorrow.   2. We are currently setting up a curve directory that all the traders can get into. This should be set up by tomorrow. Once any adjustments to (if any) the curve files are complete, I will save them to this directory. The traders who will have curve files will need to establish any links, spreads, or etc.  within them. (i.e.. linking one curve to another)  3. I will give the online trading group any product changes that you give me. They should make the necessary changes in the product list.  We plan to load curves Wednesday for testing, so this all needs to be done rather quickly. Thanks for your help.

But barring  dramatic new financial irregularity disclosures, th= e chances are good the  market will soon start moving forward again. The dr= iving force, we  believe, will be an improving economy.  S&P  chief economi= st David Wyss feels that if inventory rebuilding accelerates  sharply in th= e period just ahead, it is possible the first quarter will  show strong GDP=  growth and the second quarter a relapse into negative  territory. He point= s out that the 1990-91 recession was the only one since  the 1950s that did=  not have a positive quarter sandwiched between down  quarters. Wyss thinks=  the more likely scenario, however, is a smoother  pace of inventory accumu= lation and rising quarter-to-quarter GDP growth  through 2002.
