"__________________    REGARDING THE SETTLEMENT, ASSIGNMENT AND ASSUMPTION AGREEMENT  Tracy Ngo correctly pointed out volumetric ambiguities on the two original confirmations between Avista Energy and PG&E Energy Trading.  Let me summarize below:  (1) Avista Energy's original confirmation number 404335 showed Total Volume of 982,400 MWh's.  PG&E revised the Total Volume to 981,600 MWh.  Avista did not respond with an affirmation of the corrected volume.  Our records show that the original volume of 982,400 is correct (there was a leap-year day in year 2000).  The broker confirm and the PG&E revision seem to be both in error.  Obviously any new confirm that is written between Avista Energy and Enron will have the proper Total Volume for the remaining MWh's.  Since this Assignment references the original confirmation, our counsel recommends language to be inserted under Exhibit B as stated below (see email from Blair Strong below).  Will this sort of revision be acceptable to PG&E and Enron? Please advise.  (2) Avista Energy's original confirmation number 403862 showed a Total Volume of 14,400.  PG&E accepted the confirm ""as is.""  The broker confirmation shows total volume correctly as 876,000 MWh's.  Therefore, both PG&E and AVISTA screwed up.  HOwever, we acknowledge that the total MWh's should correctly be as per the broker confirmation.  Again, our counsel recommends language to be inserted under Exhibit B as stated below (see email from Blair Strong below).  Will this sort of revision be acceptable to PG&E and Enron?  Please advise.   To reiterate, we realize that there will be new confirmations between Enron and Avista.  Enron has traditionally written the confirmations (Enron's confirm's prevail).  Therefore, the new confirms should be acceptable.  We would like to see those confirms in advance if possible.  Lastly, time is of the essense.  We are scheduling power already for January deliveries....therefore, we must act quickly on this assignment so as to prevent any problems with scheduling, etc.  I suppose that we could delay the start dates to February 1st, 2001 if necessary.  Perhaps not a big issue.  Thanks, Nolan Steiner Ph: 509-495-8199    -----Original Message----- From: R.

Deals done on the ISDA form, where  Engish law is agreed, will automatically bring the parties to the English  courts. I think we should also consider the position under our continental  power documents and perhaps think about crystallising in writing a policy on  this area which is more trading oriented than the existing policy.  Paul   To: Scott Sefton/LON/ECT@ECT cc: Richard B Sanders/HOU/ECT@ECT, Paul Simons/LON/ECT@ECT, Tana  Jones/HOU/ECT@ECT, Edmund Cooper/LON/ECT@ECT  Subject: Re: UK Courts vs. Arbitration for UK Swap Agreements    Scott:  The response from Richard is that we are happy with UK courts so long as our  counterparty is in the UK, but if we have a counterparty on the continent and  there is any chance that submission to the exclusive jurisdiction of UK  courts might not be fully enforced in the counterparty's country, we should  go to arbitration.  In other words, we would prefer arbitration to ending up  in court in a jurisdiction in Europe.  Let's add this to the list of topics to discuss when I'm in London.  Thanks,  Mark    Scott Sefton 01/11/99 04:08 AM To: Mark - ECT Legal Taylor/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: Richard B Sanders/HOU/ECT@ECT, Paul Simons/LON/ECT@ECT, Tana  Jones/HOU/ECT@ECT  Subject: Re: UK Courts vs. Arbitration for UK Swap Agreements    My sense is that the market custom here is to use the English courts, not  arbitration. I think the English commercial court judges are pretty  sophisticated and would be able to work through the issues.  Since Paul is out this week, I haven't had a chance to speak to him about  this. Let's wait to hear his views when he returns to the office. Thanks!   To: Richard B Sanders/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: Paul Simons/LON/ECT@ECT, Scott Sefton/LON/ECT@ECT, Tana Jones/HOU/ECT@ECT  Subject: UK Courts vs. Arbitration for UK Swap Agreements  Richard:  In the US we have changed our swap agreement forms to provide for arbitration  in order to avoid having to explain the intricacies of derivatives trading to  judges or, God forbid, juries.  In Canada we are continuing to submit to the  jurisdiction of Canadian courts (on the theory that there are no juries in  civil actions and arbitration is rarely used in Canadian contracts  generally).  As we are presently in the process of revising our UK swap  agreement forms, I guess it's time to revisit the issue as it applies to UK  agreements.  Currently we agree to UK law and the jurisdiction of UK courts  (where there are no juries in civil actions).  Should this continue to be our  policy or should we begin going for arbitration in the UK contracts also?  I  would ask Paul and Scott to let Richard and me know if arbitration is widely  enough used in UK agreements that we can get away with asking for it.

The group is called GISB-Canada and as the name suggests, they intend to use the GISB gas contract as the Base Agreement and to modify the language to make it applicable in Canada.  At first, they were just going to change language like ""MMBtu"" to ""joule""; ""jurisdiction"" to ""province""; and reference a Canadian Bank interest rate rather than the Wall Street Journal.    They were going to stay away from what they deemed ""substantive"" changes.  I have asked them to reconsider this decision and to take the opportunity to ""update"" the GISB, hopefully, in a manner that could be used cross-border.  I have explained that most of our counterparties supplement the GISB with their own Special Provisions and we could use these supplements as a starting point for creating an Industry Standard GISB ""update"" that could be used cross-border.  In this regard, would you please send me a copy of your company's Special Provisions so that I can forward them to Ian Anderson in Canada.  Also, would you please put me in touch with someone in your organization that might be interested in participating in this effort.  I think it would be very helpful for the Canadians to hear about our experience with GISB and gas trading in general in developing an Industry Standard Contract.  The next meeting in Canada is this Wednesday at 12:00 p.m. (Houston Time) and again on June 26.  I would like to send them something to consider prior to the June 26 meeting.

Before deceiding  to sent or not, I wanted your thoughts on how you think that giving this  information to TVA would impact us, particularly given TVA's actions today,  re acces to transmission through third party transactions.

"Last week, the WSPP drafing group met in sunny California  to continue the  slow and steady march towards a standardized, ""national"" agreement. Schedule  C , the service schedule for firm transactions, was the primary topic and the  following is a summary of where the group is headed.  After much discussion, we proposed  that the group consider the definition of  firm energy  that Tim, Christian and others have been considering.  The  following is proposed language (the base was EPMI's version) that the WSPP  group is currently reviewing:  Firm Power is power that is sold and scheduled in accordance with applicable  reserve requirements for which the only excuse for the failure to deliver or  recieve are those set forth in Schedule 3.9 of the WSPP Agreement.  Seller  shall take steps necessary for the power to be considered Firm Power under  this definition.  Schedule 3.9 only allows interruption if (i) within agreed recall time, (ii)  due to an Uncontrollable Force or (iii) power is need for native load;  provided, however it was agreed that a party would neverless be liable for  LDs if it interrupts due to native load requirements (this last point is a  major accomplishment that apppears to have uniform agreement and will be  implemented in the next draft - the group claimed that the ""optics"" are  necessary to help traditional utilities).  As a further note, the group  agreed to do away with all references to C1 and  C2 and have just one  Schedule.  Changes from EPMI's proposed definition where  the result of the following  discussions:  1.  Generated vs. Sold - ""Sold"" was elected over ""generated"" because the  group thinks that it is the receiving control area that determines the  generator's reserve requirements.  2. ""Schedule""  was added to bolster the scheduling requirements.  3.  ""Reserves"" instead of ""Operating Reserves"" was used because the group  thought the word operating may be too restrictive.  4.  ""WSCC reserve requirements"" was replaced with ""applicable"" reserve  requirements because the group thinks that the WSPP Agreement is national in  scope and should not be limited to WSPP.  5.  References to Non-firm supply as being excluded from Firm Power was  excluded because the group thought it was redundent  - no control area would  accept a non-firm supply as being firm.  6.  Power rather than energy is being used only bacause that is the decision  that has already been made.  This defintion will be further discussed at  the next meeting on Aug 20th in  Denver.  Prior to that time, I would like to get your thoughts on how this is  shaping up and what additions/deletions are appropriate.  I look forward to  hearing your thoughts.  Thanks.

Cynthia Sandherr 08/11/99 08:49 PM   To: Elizabeth Sager/HOU/ECT@ECT, Joe Hartsoe/Corp/Enron@Enron cc: Steven J Kean/HOU/EES@EES, Christi L Nicolay/HOU/ECT@ECT, James B  Fallon/HOU/ECT@ECT, Joe Hillings/Corp/Enron@Enron (bcc: Cynthia  Sandherr/Corp/Enron) Subject: TVA authority  Craven Crowell's authority to act without a full TVA board is limited by  federal statutory authority to only carrying out ""administrative functions.""   He is explicitly prohibited from carrying out ""policy functions"" without the  other board members in place.  We know who the Administration intends to  nominate for the two board vacancies, however, these candidates can only be  officially nominated and confirmed by Congress sometime after Congress  reconvenes on September 8th at the earliest.  Since I know you would like an immediate fix to your TVA control area issue,  during the month of August you might pursue TVA's policy actions against our  control area in violation of federal statute.  (In the meantime, however,  I  am continuing to work the Appropriations strategy (best possible resolution  date October 1, 1999) and the Authorization strategy (best possible  resolution date October 7, 2000.))  Currently, the TVA Inspector General George Prosser who can be reached at   (423) 632-4120 is in hot pursuit of Mr. Crowell.  He has successfully had  legislation introduced to curb Mr. Crowell's authorities, and soon will issue  a report (sure to receive much front page negative publicity) that Mr.  Crowell ""lied"" to Congress by failing to disclose a TVA $100,000 monthly  publicity retainer with Hill & Knowlton to a House Congressional Oversight  Committee.  Ironically, this retainer was to help Mr. Crowell obtain  favourable earned media.  We believe  the I.G. could easily be persuaded to pursue the wrong-doing  caused by Mr. Crowell in developing TVA policy in the absence of a board.  If  he pursues the case, he would likely immediate reinstate our positions during  the investigation so as not to cause further harm, plus he could require TVA  to pay damages if he successfully proves his case.  Regardless, this  investigation would cause nasty publicity for TVA.  I have discussed with Joe Hartsoe what materials he may wish to provide the  I.G. in order to help him make our case that this action ""created policy.""  I  have also given Joe Hartsoe a listing of all of TVA's industrial customers  likely curtailed during the heat wave.  We should contact a few of these  industrials in order to also ask them to intervene against TVA's policy  action on our control area.  These industrials could also claim monetary  damages from being wrongfully curtailed by a policy that arguably reduced the  amount of available power in the region.    The down side is Mr. Crowell could pursue ""administrative"" retributions  against Enron activities.

This is a sale and  buy back structure whereby Enron sells on a border basis to a Dutch  distribution company who then sells back to Enron a proportion of the power  on a free on Koppelnet basis. The Koppelnet is the Dutch grid.  The deals are designed to secure as much cross border capacity to take  advantage of the still significant arbitrage between power prices within the  Netherlands and those outside. At the moment the grid operator, TenneT,  allocates transmission capacity on a pro rata basis without charge. This has  led to significant gaming of the system with huge oversubscription for cross  border capacity, and the structure we have developed in Enron has been  designed to take advantage of the system and still stay within the rules laid  down by TenneT and the regulator, the DTe. Should anyone like to have a copy  of the 2 transaction agreements, then pls call me.   We are in negotaitions with other distribution companies in relation to this  structure.  tks     ",elizabeth.sager@enron.com,mark.taylor@enron.com,re Westland Energie BV - capacity deals for 2000,1999-09-22 09:51:00-07:00,received

"I have scheduled a meeting for October 7th from 8:30 to 2:30 in room 3321 to  recommence the project we began in January to review the existing  Houston-based financial, gas and power trading forms.  All of you should have  received a black binder labelled ""Analysis of ECT's Finacial, Power, Gas  Forms""  which contains all of the long and short forms used for trading (as  such forms existed in January 1999), as well as my summary comparison as to  how each of the forms handles certain legal issues (eg, termination, cover,  assignement, confidentiality ....).  If you did not receive or cannot locate  this binder, let me know and I will forward to you another copy.  This  analysis was done in January.   I am aware that some of the forms may have  changed since then but have not undertaken to ""update"" the memo as we will be  able to discuss such changes at the meeting.  The purpose of the meeting is to review how each of the Houston-based  trading  forms has been structured and to note where there are differences.   The ultimate goal is to determine what Enron's ""model"" trading provisions  should be and to determine a consistent approach unless there is a justified  rational for treating the commodities in a different manner.  With this in  mind, I would hope to be able to create a ""modular type"" contract  whereby  each legal issue would have a recommended approach, evidenced by language  that will be approved by the group.  By way of example, Enron's gas contract  prohibits assignement without consent, which consent can be withheld for any  reason.  The financial form provides that a party can not unreasonably  withhold its consent.  At this meeting we would discuss what the preferred  approach is and then begin the process of drafting appropriate language,  which language would be approved at a seperate meeting.  This  ""modular  assignment section"" could then be dropped into all trading forms unless  differences were required due to the commodity/product involved.  You will note that the analysis performed to date does not include all areas  of a trading contract.  Similiar steps will still need to be undertaken with  other provisions such as credit terms.  At the meeting, I hope to further  discuss the additional areas everybody believes should be reviewed.  Aron Roffwarg, a lawyer  from Bracewell, will also be at the meeting to  assist us in this effort.

Nevertheless, the contract should be a workable tool that hopefully will  benefit the power market.  A clean and redline version of the contract are  attached.  They were prepared by the Drafting Committee and every effort was  made to include comments received during and since the September 24 meeting  at EEI.  At this stage of the initiative, it would not be productive to circulate  non-substantive comments (word smithing/formatting).  On the other hand, it  would be useful to send any substantive comments or questions about the  mechanics of the contract and how the contract language might apply under  certain scenarios.  The best forum to respond to your questions or comments  will be the November 17 Power Marketing Transactions conference in  Washington, D.C.   Accordingly, it would be helpful to tailor your comments  to the conference program.  Questions, comments, and hypotheticals could be  worked into the panel discussions.  Moreover, many of your colleagues from  the Working Group will be on the panels or attending the conference.  For  your convenience, a copy of the conference program is attached.  Send your  comments to either Patty Dondanville, pdondanville@schiffhardin.com, or David  Perlman, dmperlman@pwrsrc.com  Feel free to contact me if you have any questions.   Andrew S.

"Christi  Here is a brief summary of the TVA/EPMI lawsuit - Let me know if you would  like more information   (Note - the MOPA has been filed under seal in order to protect  confidentiality  - The judge was sensitive about this given the potential  right of a party to get the MOPA from TVA under a FOIA - Accordingly, we  don't want to encourage further invetigation of the MOPA by third parties)    *EPMI filed a declaratory judgement proceeding on November 15, 1999 against  TVA in the District Court for the Eastern District of Tennessee.  Judge Edgar  has been assigned the matter.  *The lawsuit concerns the interpretation of an option contract EPMI and TVA  entered into on December 6, 1995 (Master Option Purchase Agreement (MOPA).  *The sole issue presented by the declaratory judgement is the obligations of  TVA and EPMI under the MOPA in the circumstances where EPMI is unable to  schedule for delivery, or deliver, energy requested by TVA under the MOPA at  the Scheduled Delivery Point (SDP) if the available transfer capability at  the SDP is not sufficient to allow the schedule or delivery.  EPMI believes  that the MOPA unambiguously addresses the issue.    *A trial date in late June 2000 has been set.  *EPMI filed a Motion for Summary Judgement on November 18, 1999.

"As you are aware, the legal group has been considering EPMI's options given  TVA's failure during the summer of 99 to treat Enron's control areas in a  manner similiar to other control areas.    One option we have considered is the possibility of claiming monetary  damages against TVA  for TVA's breach of NERC policies.  In order to make  such a statement, we would, in essence, be required to assert that the NERC  policies are a ""contract"" which all NERC members are obligated to abide by  and for which the failure to do so could result in monetary damages.  One  concern with this strategy is whether EPMI and/or its affiliates could  possibly be damaged in other, unrelated  proceedings if it was determined  that NERC policies were indeed ""contractual obligations"" (e.g., a third party  claims monetary damages against EPMI for an alleged violation of NERC  ""contractual policies"").  It would be very helpful if you would consider this issue and get back to me  with any thoughts or comments you have.  Thanks for your help.

If PECO wants to continue to explore the transmission points, or other FERC policy points they no doubt will, but I don't think they go on the agenda, and certainly not first. I think it would be very important to attach current products definitions to the agenda, and would therefore plead with Liz and Marty to see if we can get those implemented and to Andy for distribution by Friday.  Also, Mitch Dutton was the one with custody of the System Firm definition, and I will call him today to see if he can get it massaged and to Andy by Friday morning.   I'd love to have a discussion, with traders present, about the bookout issue, but I don't know if we'll have time.  The other ""global"" issue that the traders need to focus on (and will no doubt want an update on) is the status of the efforts to get FERC on board.  Andy, can we at least give them tentatively that we WILL meet with FERC staff in January, and the tentative dates of the rollout sessions on the contract in Houston and New York?

In addition to the comments/questions noted within  the Confirmation itself, I have the following thoughts/questions:  1) Note that the Enron Corp Guaranty is currently limited to an aggregate  amount of $30,000,000 (this may become an issue late in the day when the  folks over at Merrill figure out that this is one of the disadvantages to  using a confirm as opposed to doing a sep. transaction with a separate and  distinct Enron Corp. Guaranty);  2) Per Section 1.1 of the Master, in the event of any conflicts between the  Master and a Confirm for a particular transaction, the Confirm governs;  3) Section 1.4 of the Master Agreement makes reference to a ""Qualified  Financial Contract"" - is that applicable to this Transaction?  Might this  somehow cause the accountants to treat the Transaction differently?;  4) Do we need to negate the reference to a ""Forward Contract"" in Section 4.6  of the Master (Elizabeth we spoke about a concern that you had regarding this  exact issue);  5) What changes should be made to the Confirm given the agreed to changes in  the ISDA (Severability and Notice Update for example);  6) The last sentence of the Master appears to be missing some language.  It  currently reads ""Disallowance of cost pass-through or any unfavorable or any  Affiliate of the Non-Defaulting Party shall not constitute a requirement for  a change to the terms of this Agreement."";  7) Should we still eliminate the last portion of Section 8.1(ii) of the  Master to permit free assignment to an Affiliate (this previously was a big  issue given our concern that we might have to assign certain rights to an  Affiliate in the event of a bankruptcy).  Section 8.1(ii) currently reads:    Neither Party shall assign this Agreement or its rights hereunder without  the prior written consent of the other Party, which consent may be withheld    in its sole discretion; provided, however, either Party may, without the  consent of (but with notice to) the other Party (and without relieving itself  from    liability hereunder), (i) transfer, sell, pledge, encumber or assign this  Agreement and all Transactions hereunder as a whole or the accounts,    revenues or proceeds hereof as a whole in connection with any financing or  other financial arrangements, (ii) transfer or assign this   Agreement to an Affiliate of such Party; provided, that such Party's Credit  Support Provider issues a Credit Support    Document substantially in the form provided in connection with the  execution hereof,;   8) The draft of the Confirmation does not make reference to any of the 3  ""Facilities"".  Does it have to for acct purposes even though the only time  that it was used was in the sections deal with gas supply (which did not make  it into the Confirmation) and Section 6.2 of the prior physical agreement  which used to make ""Buyer responsible for charges imposed on the delivery of  Energy from a given Facility but related to the operation of third party  transmission"" (this provision is not reflected in the Master and I suspect  that Merrill would object strongly to its incorporation);  9) Did we ever determine whether the draft of the Confidentiality Agreement  that I prepared was executed by Merrill?; and  10) The Master currently defines Stranded Costs but does not contain the  standard provision regarding the same (should this be introduced???)

"At 10:45 am today, Jan 6th, we sent a notice to TVA advising them that a  Triggering Event under the MOPA had occurred.  As a result of the Triggering  Event, EPMI has the right to suspend deliveries and/or to terminate the  MOPA.  At this point, we have not elected to suspend deliveries or to  terminate the MOPA.  Accordingly, our performance under the MOPA at this  point will not be impacted and we will continue to perform under the terms of  the MOPA.    The letter also sets forth a proposal to TVA pursuant to which EPMI would be  willing to continue performing under the MOPA.  This proposal is conditioned  on  TVA allowing EPMI to seek a judicial determination of its rights and  TVA  paying market-based rates for the energy delivered by EPMI to TVA under the  MOPA  pending the judicial proceedings.

""Location, if any, of any office available to the general public or  Maine customers:""  The draft says ""N/A"".  Shouldn't we put in Houston  office?  Dan A's office?  13.  Customer rep. --Ramona in Dublin is EES customer rep.  Who will be ENA's?  15.  Should EPMI's response be limited to supplied RETAIL electricity in  these jurisdictions?  Otherwise, all 48 states should be listed for EPMI.   Also, the current EES sales in NEPOOL (New Hampshire and Rhode Island, I  think) are made by EPMI.  There was/is also a retail sale in the MAPP area by  EPMI, I think.  21.  EES' response is not exactly true with regard to EPMI, since it has been  involved in civil legal actions.  However, does this really request any civil  cases?  Can we answer by saying ""no enforcement proceedings by any state in  which EPMI is providing retail sales of electricity?""   Tom, The application says ""Q"" is attached as other supporting material, but I  can't find Q.  Also, you marked the Annual Electric Utility Report for 1998  as ""A"", but I am not sure where it should go (""A"" is already answered.)  Thanks for the information.

Since this deal started in Sept. they  have only paid one invoice and that was paid 16 days late.  They are  currently 57 days late on one outstanding invoice and 29 days late on  another.  They have failed to come up with $ despite two ""heart-to-heart""  discussions with Dale Hrcak about this issue.  Stone and Webster, the firm  building their Riverside plant, I guess controls the cash during this  start-up period and Dale cannot get them to release funds.  They seem  disorganized and fail to give us straight answers on when we will be paid.   If Enron did not own a piece of this company I would be talking to credit and  legal about whether or not Can Fibre is in default and what steps we should  take to require collateral and/or termiante this agreement.

"Andy   As we discussed during  the last conference call, attached is a revised  Article 8,  Credit Provisions, to the EEI Contract, along with a revised  section for the Cover Page.  The changes were made to make Article 8 more  user friendly and to incorporate the few comments that were agreed  to during  the conference call.  I tried blacklining, but that proved not decipherable  due to the extensive formatting changes.  Maybe you will have better  success.  I have attempted to mark by hand the changes and will fax that to  you in case you want to distribute it to the rest of the group.  The only changes that were not discussed on the call (other than those  resulting from the global restructuring) that I made are as follows:  1.  Changed  the Section entitled ""Performance Assurance"" to ""Collateral  Threshold"" - Use of PA seemed  misleading since PA is referenced in other  sections dealing with collateral.  2. Added the words ""acceptable to Party ___"" in new Section 8.1(d) and 8.2(d)  in order to clarify, as we did in Sections 8.1 (a) and 8.2(a)  that the  security must be acceptable to the receiving party.  3.

While  it is correct that the CFTC proposes to regulate commodities with exhaustible and nearly inexhaustible supplies differently, it has not characterized power as having an inexhaustible supply.  In fact, I would expect the CFTC to treat  power as having a finite supply at any given time.  This means, for example, that power derivatives traded on a multilateral transaction execution facility  would not qualify for exemption from the Commodity Exchange Act under the current proposal.  I think the EEI and other industry groups should consider  attempting to persuade the CFTC to exempt physical and derivative power contracts from certain provisions of the CEA under the CFTC's proposal to consider exemptions on a ""case-by-case basis.""  See, for example, the discussion of DTFs on pages  9 and 10 of the proposal.  I hope this clarifies the CFTC's proposal.       Regards, Paul  Paul J.

"A huge debate has been ongoing in he battle whether to include language in  the EEI Contract that would provide that a confirmation that contains  ""substantive"" terms not discussed by the traders is subject to the ""deemed  accepted"" language.  I have been very vocal against  adding this language.   The politics as you can tell from this email have been fierce, and as in much  of successful politics, dirty.  I'm not sure where this will end up, but feel  like it is important that we all are aware of the history here as well as  Enron's position (Confirmation needs to be the final, best evidence unless  objected to in a timely manner). I will keep everybody posted on the results  of the vote.  ---------------------- Forwarded by Elizabeth Sager/HOU/ECT on 02/28/2000  10:29 AM ---------------------------   ""Andy Katz"" <AKatz@eei.org> on 02/25/2000 03:52:18 PM To: fmdutton@aep.com, hemu@dynegy.com, Elizabeth Sager/HOU/ECT@ECT,  mroger3@entergy.com, wfhenze@jonesday.com, dperlman@powersrc.com,  rosteen@powersrc.com, drusso@reliantenergy.com cc:   Subject: FWD:  Today's Decision    I am passing on the following message from Patty expressing her concern with  today's decision to limit the choice on the ballot to optional language or no  language.  Cutting through the ""edge"" of her comments, no doubt brought on by  the frustration of being outvoted, I believe she has some valid points on our  process here.  I have avoided  taking a position on substantive questions  regarding the contract, but I too have a process concern  which I have raised  with some of you individually.  I apologize for not vocalizing these concerns  this morning.  Nevertheless, this is what I intend to do .  Given that Mitch  was not available for the discussion and knowing Mitch's position on this  issue compels me to release the comments he wanted circulated before going on  vacation.  If there is a consensus from the balloting that the language  should be included, but not as an option or as an ""opt out"" provision, this  drafting committee should respect that sentiment.    The attention of many members of the Drafting Committee has waned and EEI members (electric utilities which conduct wholesale power transactions) are no longer represented on the Drafting Committee. Mitch, in his email, did not think EEI member views were considered on the Tuesday call.  And today's call  by Constellation, Enron, EPMC (and Jones, Day and Schiff) did not even include any EEI members...      The language compromise I accept, and believe that Mitch would accept, in the spirit of Drafting Committee give and take.  But let's not kid ourselves.  Today, a few members of the Drafting Committee made a decision that even Mitch (the only EEI member on the Tuesday call) did not think we had made or would make.  Read his email.  Today's decision was to not even ""allow"" the EEI members' vote to be heard  to choose what they overwhelmingly chose in Houston --- that is, to have the provision in Section 2.3 of the Contract --- not just an option on the Cover sheet). Today's decision is just wrong.       As the person who was standing in the front of the room in Houston, I feel strongly  that I know what occurred, and what Comed, Dynegy,  Cinergy, IPALCO, AEP, Ameren and Toni Frost's group of utilities, among others, know they voted on.   I am the person that folks are going to call to ask why their views were ignored.  I had become comfortable with the explanation for the revote --- to either not add the language at all, add to 2.3, or add as an option.  But now Working Group is not being given the choice  to vote as they did, like the result or not, in Houston.  Even Fritz's suggestion that three choices be given on the ballot was ignored.  Those three choices, as I understood it, would have included an even more aggressive elimination of the 2 business day presumption that the confirm, as sent, controls.       The question I asked...  why we are afraid of even giving the Working Group the choice to express the same views they expressed in Houston...was never answered.      When  EEI members call me to ask about this, I intend to suggest that they vote ""YES"" on the ballot, and then  add an admonition to their ballot that the language be included in 2.3 and not just be an option on the cover sheet.  I would hope that the Drafting Committee (or whoever remains on it) would at least consider such added comments although, again, after today I have my doubts.  I intend to call some of the EEI members that I know will feel strongly about this.  Since I know Mitch will not be around (and don't feel he should be disenfranchised), I also intend to call AEP as a courtesy.  I no longer support the idea of not forwarding Mitch's email to the whole group, as he obviously intended.       Ironically or perhaps intentionally, the Drafting Committee's failure to address this directly until almost a month after the Houston meeting means people won't even have a 2 Business Day voting window. Nonetheless, regardless of the vote, I intend to discuss this in the implementation discussion in the Houston/New York seminars.   Andrew S.

To Members of the Working Group:  A proposal was considered at the meeting in Houston on January 26 to add  language to Article 2.3 of the Master Agreement which would require an  agreement of both parties before any contract terms not part of the oral  Transaction (but added to the written Confirmation) could become binding.   Those in favor of adding such language hope to avoid the ""long form  confirmations"" which have proliferated in the marketplace in the absence of  an underlying master agreement - those containing arbitration clauses, Y2K  representations and other non-commercial terms.  Those who oppose adding such  language believe it is critical to market participants to know at some point,  relatively promptly after the oral trade call, that the confirm represents  the commercial Transaction, and that trade tapes can be overwritten.  They  ask only that counterparties accept or reject the commercial Transaction  terms within two Business Days.  If there is a dispute about the terms of the  Transaction as it appears in the Confirmation, they want to be notified so  that tapes can be preserved and the issues can be addressed promptly.  After much discussion, the Drafting Committee has developed language that  could be added.  Given the strong feelings on both sides of this issue,  however, the Drafting Committee decided to poll each company in the Working  Group as to whether such  additional language should be added at all.   If  the Working Group votes ""yes"", the additional language below would be  inserted in Article 2.3 as an option that only would apply if selected on the  cover sheet.  The following wording was developed by the Drafting Committee:  ""If a Confirmation contains provisions, other than those provisions relating  to the commercial terms of the Transaction (e.g., price, special transmission  conditions), which modify or supplement the general terms and conditions of  this Master Agreement (e.g., arbitration provisions,  additional  representations and warranties), then such provisions shall not be deemed to  be accepted pursuant to this Article 2.3 unless agreed to either orally or in  writing by the Parties; provided that the foregoing will not affect the  validity and binding nature of the Transaction.""  Accordingly, would ONE representative from each company in the Working Group  please respond using the REPLY function of your email program to the  following questions by cob Tuesday, February 29:   1. Should the language addressing this point be inserted into the Master  Agreement?  (If  yes, the language will be an option selected on the Cover  Sheet.)  Yes_____ No_____   Andrew S.

DeDe and I spoke this afternoon regarding the ""Independent Amount"" term in the EEI Agreement.  Just to provide some feedback from a ""users"" perspective, the ""Independent Amount"" concept was something that Elizabeth Sager suggested we use as a proxy for bilateral margining which I introduced at the Sept. EEI meeting in D.C. This term was literally ""borrowed"" from the ISDA Agreement.  The definition used in the ISDA Credit Support Annex is as follows: ""Independent Amount"" means, with respect to a party, the amount specified as such for that party in Paragraph 13; if no amount is specified, zero. (The ISDA Paragraph 13 is synonymous with the EEI Cover Sheet)  There isn't a ""definition"" per se.  The term comes into play in 8.3 as it is added to the Termination Payment and compared to the Collateral Threshold.  To put it in another way, it acts as ""buffer"" Termination Payment to handle additional potential credit exposure created by transactions valued against extremely volatile price indices.

Buyer puts in request for Firm transmission within 30 minutes of Seller's  notification and request is accepted and purchased by Buyer.  Entergy is  sinking in Cinergy.   Seller must move to another interface (either on  Cinergy's border (NIPSCO,  LG&E, AEP. . .) or in Cinergy's control area (Wabash) at which Buyer can  receive energy such that energy can sink in Cinergy.  Seller can require  Buyer to purchase Non-Firm transmission (or Firm, if available) but each  party will be responsible for any additional transmission costs incurred to  reschedule to another delivery point.  Ex #2  3. Buyer puts in request for Firm transmission within 30 minutes of Seller's  notification and receives response that Firm is available.  Buyer purchases  Non-Firm instead.  Entergy is sinking in Cinergy.  Ex #3  3. Buyer puts in request for Firm transmission from Cinergy within 30 minutes  of Seller's notification and request is accepted and purchased by Buyer.   Buyer also secures Firm transmission from LG&E to sink energy in LG&E.   There are references to specific sections in the product definition, I don't  know if they are still valid in light of the latest changes.  Could someone help me out before 4pm Eastern?  Thanks.

We tried to  come up with as many arguments as possible, recognizing the strong commercial  desire to put in the second interconnect.  As we have discussed, certain  language in the Interconnect Agreement is troublesome, generally due to the  fact that it does not appear that a second interconnect was contemplated at  the time the project was initially developed.  Nonetheless, we believe that  Caledonia does have a number of arguments in favor of the position that it  should be able to build the second interconnect without a contractual block.   The strength of some of these arguments will turn in large part on further  factual development with the commercial group, as noted in a number of places  in the memo.  Please let me know when you wish to follow up.  And, as I noted in my  conversation with Elizabeth this morning, there is a possibility I may be in  Houston next week and perhaps we could meet with the commercial folks at that  time.  I think it would be advisable to walk through the various possible  scenarios/strategies with them so that we have the benefit of the TVA  ""history"" and likely responses of TVA to some of the arguments noted in the  memo.

Avoid eyestrain!                      Print it before you continue!!  Dear Liz,      I wish I=01,d been at the house when you called the other Friday. Robert and I were scrambling about attending to a dozen last minute errands on our last full day stateside. Just that morning he had interviewed at Flint Hill School, a K-12 private school in Oakton, and came back beaming. He hit it off with everyone he spoke with, and they let him know they would offer him the job - Director of Technology - as soon as they checked his references! The Headmaster called the following Weds night with an offer and said he=01,d have the contract in the mail the next day. Of course he assumed Robert would want to discuss it with his wife - as of February 16, 2000, that=01,s me!- before accepting. Thursday night, two weeks ago, Robert called him back to deliver a resounding =01&I accept!=018. He=01,s very excited about the job, a truly promising and stimulating change from strictly teaching. The school=01,s policy is that all administrators must teach a class, so he=01,ll be keeping one foot in the classroom. We were SO very relieved that the salary offered was more than we expected, and we believe we=01,ll be able to live comfortably. Very good news considering that there=01,ll be no second income any time soon for this future NoVa household! Unless I sell a screenplay or start a home-based business down the line - Avon calling?, Tupperware Parties?, Mary Kay?, Amway? medical billing? stuffing envelopes? The Hamptons will, after all, be back in the Land of Opportunity!!!     His job starts late July, and we=01,ll stay with my parents until we can find a good  place to live. I=01,d like to live as close to the school as possible so he=01,ll be spared the hardships of commuting. The Vienna Metro - the last stop on that line - isn=01,t far from the school, so we could also consider living near other stops back down the line where he could ideally walk to the station and ride from there. That area out there is unknown territory in my experience. Vienna is as far as I ever got while growing up in Langley. I'm hankering to make a home these days, so I'm excited at the prospect of hunting for one. And of course I'll have Mom's seasoned advice and assistance. I even have a few boxes of housewares still in storage at my parents from when Philip and I lived on 10th Street in New York. They haven't seen the light of day in almost 15 years! I have no idea what I'll find   when I open them up! Robert has acquired very little, mostly books and CDs,  living solo for so long. This is fortunate because shipping belongings to the States from here is bound to be a complicated chore and expensive as well.      As much as Robert has enjoyed life here in Roma since arriving in the fall of 1988 to work at the American Overseas School of Rome (where he has been teaching ever since), we didn=01,t seriously consider remaining here. Job opportunities are very limited for someone who is not a citizen of the EU. In that respect it=01,s rather a dead end. For me the charms and pleasures of city living in general are few and far-between at this time in my life. And I find the urban living conditions here even harder to cope with than in the U.S.. The noise and air pollution are greater, and the traffic seems far worse and more chaotic - inadequate roads, more automobiles, and hordes of infernal, spewing, deafening motorbikes that don=01,t observe even the most basic of traffic laws and make every trip an obstacle course. But  my greatest pet peeve?   The clouds of cigarette smoke everywhere you go!  It really is nauseating and spoils the pleasure of eating out or going to a cafe or coffee bar.     We flew back to Rome Saturday March 4, having spent 3 weeks with my parents on Hampton Ridge Drive in The Hamptons - how fitting! Robert Hampton was entitled to 2 weeks matrimonial leave (Italian Law!) and the third week was the school=01,s mid-winter vacation. My doctor had no objections to my flying in my 8th month, so I wasn=01,t uneasy about it. Our flight to D.C. via Newark was a breeze because we were on a less-than-full 777, the biggest, most spacious, and most comfortable plane I=01,ve ever experienced. Our return flight was another story entirely - a DC10, cramped, stuffy, packed with passengers (many were bible-toting pilgrims to the Eternal City), dreadfully dry air- it was miserable! It took me almost a full week to recover from that night and the jet lag. Of course at this stage in my pregnancy I=01,m experiencing the occasional acute discomfort, but for the most part it=01,s been a trouble-free 8 months. What a unique sensation it is feeling the baby bumping around in the womb.! I can=01,t help but laugh much of the time, it=01,s such a curious sensation and sight! She=01,s been very active all along, at all times of the day and evening.  I=01,m glad to say most nights I sleep quite soundly.     Baby is due April 6th, two weeks from Thursday, and the school=01,s spring vacation is April 15th - May 2, so Daddy=01,s Home!!! Mom will be coming over as soon as her 2nd granddaughter is this side of the womb. We returned to find Spring has arrived here! with lots of birdsong and flowering all around: cherry and almond blossoms, mimosa (a new sight and scent for me), daffodils, daisies and violets. I must say I=01,m glad our daughter will be arriving at this balmy time of year. We are still undecided about a name for her, but we agree we=01,d like it to be Italian in honor of her birthplace. We=01,re told she may even be entitled to Italian citizenship! But as with all things regarding Italian law and its interpretation and real-world application, one never knows until one dares to enter the byzantine and infernal world of Italian bureaucracy! We went to the Italian Embassy in D.C. with our marriage certificate in order to get a proper visa for me (tourists are only permitted to stay in the country 3 months at a time), only to learn that the only one that I could apply for is impossible under the circumstances! Because Robert has been residing in the country, he is required to request from the authorities here that his spouse join him. Then once his request is granted he must send the appropriate paperwork to me in the U.S. where I in turn approach the Embassy for the visa. And we learned the other day that the waiting period here just for an appointment to make the initial request is 5 months!     There=01,s a possibility that because I=01,m pregnant and have already joined him here I can get some kind of residence permit. We wanted me to be here legally so there would be no snags when it comes time to register the baby=01,s birth. It=01,s all rather exasperating. Even the American Embassy needs to see my divorce certificates in order for us to register her birth with them! I had to go rummaging in my parents=01, basement to find them, and it will be the first time I=01,ve had reason to present them to anyone!     The last 8 months have been eventful, to say the least! Our romance started in Waterford (where I was housesitting for the summer) the first weekend in July, and it started with a conscious, expressed, and mutual desire to have and raise a child together. We=01,ve known each other since living in Charlottesville in 1981, and curiously enough he met both Philip, in New York in 1983/84, and Tom, when he and I spent a few days here in Rome in November of 1990 just a couple of months after we got married. Also, we=01,d spent time together over the past couple of summers on Block Island, and I=01,d visited him here back in January of 1998. But not until this past summer were we both truly unattached and free to get involved. We feel it was a beautiful twist of fate that I got pregnant right away. The fact is I=01,d read for years that it can take much time and effort for a woman my age - I turned 40 in October- to conceive. We feel such joy and promise being together and are looking forward to joining the rest of you in the secret society known as Parenthood! Robert is the most wonderful and sweetest man I=01,ve ever been with. He is so good-natured and even-tempered and bright. Life with him just gets better and better. I do hope our daughter has his disposition!     So you can see why we felt it was fitting that we get married in Waterford! We arrived in Virginia on Sunday the 13th and made our way to the Loudon County Courthouse in Leesburg on the afternoon of the 15th to get the license. One doesn=01,t need to be a resident of Virginia, and there is no waiting period since the state doesn=01,t require blood tests. Caroline had already made inquiries about the civil ceremony. They aren=01,t performed at the Court House but the Office of the Clerk of the Circuit Court provides the names and numbers of =01&local civil marriage celebrants=018. We called around Monday and found that Mr. Fred Howard was willing to come to Waterford the morning of the 16th. The woman who completed the license for us asked us who would be officiating. We answered and she exclaimed, =01&Well, he=01,s right behind you!=018. We turned around where we stood at the counter and saw a portrait on the wall identified as Fred Howard, Clerk of the Circuit Court, 1969-1981! It turns out both he and his wife are natives of Leesburg. He was a delightful and gracious man, and we were so pleased with the ceremony.     The fact is we=01,d given almost no thought to the =01&event=018 itself! Caroline made it truly memorable by making a cake and a bridal bouquet, buying champagne, dressing us that very morning, and taking photographs. I=01,d bought a loose-fitting size 16 deep blue velvet floor-length sleeveless shift on Monday at Marshall=01,s for $10, a haphazard purchase I made on the fly while shopping for an interview outfit for Robert. I=01,d also bought some special tea from Paris at Sutton Place Gourmet across from my parents and packed 4 of Grandmother=01,s best teacups, thinking we could have a tea ceremony of sorts to mark the occasion. Out of the blue (the result of Caroline=01,s prompting!), Robert appeared in one of Charlie=01,s suits! It sent me into a panic - my casual black wool turtleneck under my dress wouldn=01,t do now! Caroline came up with a long and flowing ivory silk blouse and a string of pearls that complemented my dress perfectly. And so the wedding party - Caroline, Charlie, Walker, Robert Michael Hampton, and Jacqueline Walker Brock - took their places in the cabin before Mr. Howard who shortly thereafter pronounced us husband and wife! (No matter that there were no rings to exchange! I=01,ll be looking for one here in Rome. Robert has never worn a ring and is reluctant to do so. Perhaps a tattoo is in order! ) And then we were able to go outside for a photo session because the weather that day was so balmy. Two days later snow and sleet arrived, but for the rest of our visit the weather was very agreeable and temperatures were warm and spring-like most every day.      I would love to hear from you! I=01,ve been meaning to get in touch for months. How=01,s Y2K treating the Cox family of Houston? How did you celebrate the New Year/New Millennium? I understand that you=01,ll be going to Tina=01,s wedding with Ella and that Alex and Lucy and Kate and Chi will be there as well. That should be both a memorable reunion and curious event! Boy was it shocking to learn that Mrs. Pafenburg died and that Mr. Pafenburg is now living with Tina and suffering from Alzheimer=01,s and requiring a full-time attendant to look after him. It truly makes me appreciate the good health and life that my parents have.     E-mail me when you can! Hope all is well with you. Love to you and Grant, Ella and Sam,  AND HAPPY SPRING!!!!

",  Elizabeth:  Here is a set of documents which might be useful as a starting point for your  situation.  The idea in the transaction for which they were tailored was that  the California Energy Commission (""CEC"") and three California UDC's would  divert payments they were otherwise  required to make to a blackballed ESP  into the infamous ""Lockbox.""  The bank-administrator of the Lockbox was to  swear in blood to send money coming into the lockbox to our account first and  dribble any leftovers to the blackballed ESP as they saw fit.  Also,  the  mili-second that the funds plunked into the Lockbox a virulent ""Security  Interest"" attached itself like a vampire to the juggler vein of these funds  and this security interest was for our benefit.     Although I am proud to have the  name Yoder associated with the Lockbox  concept,  I must in all modesty confess I have never closed out a real deal  using the damn thing.  Stewart Rosman, an innovative trader who is well known  for his patience with the legal process,  and later,  John ""Big Sky""  Malowney,   tried valiantly to get Legal to implement this sturcture but  alas, I cannot yet put it on my resume as a triumph.  Good luck and let me  know if I can help out in any way with your project.----cgy ",elizabeth.sager@enron.com,christian.yoder@enron.com,Lockbox documents,2000-03-24 07:20:00-08:00,received

We will be purchasing blocks of 5 x 16 liquidated damages firm energy each week. The minimum block size will be 25 MW delivered to the TVA control area.  The Draft Master Purchase Agreement reflects the requirements and constraints placed on us as a participant in the TVA program.  Valley energy is in the process of obtaining a Line of Credit to satisfy the credit requirements of our supplier counterparties.  We are also interested in similar protection for situations where liquidated damages may be due from our suppliers.  Please review the attached documents and provide me with feedback as soon as possible.  Our objective is to be able to conduct business by April 6, 2000, which is the first day TVA will allow us to participate.  Power purchased on April 6 would be for delivery beginning April 10, 2000.  Call if you have questions.  Thank you very much,      - ValleyEnergyConfirmation.doc  - masterpurchase-3-22-00.doc  - FACT SHEET - WETM1.doc   Jack W.

The idea in the transaction for which they were tailored was that  the California Energy Commission (""CEC"") and three California UDC's would  divert payments they were otherwise  required to make to a blackballed ESP  into the infamous ""Lockbox.""  The bank-administrator of the Lockbox was to  swear in blood to send money coming into the lockbox to our account first and  dribble any leftovers to the blackballed ESP as they saw fit.  Also,  the  mili-second that the funds plunked into the Lockbox a virulent ""Security  Interest"" attached itself like a vampire to the juggler vein of these funds  and this security interest was for our benefit.     Although I am proud to have the  name Yoder associated with the Lockbox  concept,  I must in all modesty confess I have never closed out a real deal  using the damn thing.  Stewart Rosman, an innovative trader who is well known  for his patience with the legal process,  and later,  John ""Big Sky""  Malowney,   tried valiantly to get Legal to implement this sturcture but  alas, I cannot yet put it on my resume as a triumph.  Good luck and let me  know if I can help out in any way with your project.----cgy  ",brenda.whitehead@enron.com,elizabeth.sager@enron.com,Please print - Lockbox documents,2000-03-27 02:06:00-08:00,sent

Attached is a table that sets forth the monthly  quantities and our indicative pricing (will be refreshing pricing based on  updated forwards).  They have decided not to go with the purchase for Jul-Aug  at this time.  They seem to have gotten their act a little better together  this time around with pre-approvals internally, but any deal they do would  still need to be approved by the NHPUC.  Here's the scoop on timeline:  They will send to us a draft contract this Friday for review/comment.  We  need to have our comments back to them by Weds Apr 5th.  Elizabeth, does this  fit your schedule OK? They plan to hold negotiations with us and other parties via phone on Monday  Apr 10th, and hope to close  a deal that same day.  Again, this deal would be  subject to NHPUC approval, so we need to get a feel for the risk of NHPUC  disapproval. Tracy - as you know, they are not so attractive from a credit standpoint.    Is letter of credit sufficient in their case?  Can we talk about what we need  to put in place for the transaction.

"This is the subject of the meeting w Larry for 230 today on 31 in control room ----- Forwarded by Elizabeth Sager/HOU/ECT on 05/17/2000 09:54 AM -----   Larry Soderquist  05/17/2000 09:42 AM        To: Elizabeth Sager/HOU/ECT@ECT    cc: Larry Soderquist/HOU/ECT@ECT, Thresa A Allen/HOU/ECT@ECT, Lloyd  Will/HOU/ECT@ECT, Mitch Robinson/Corp/Enron@Enron, Amy Spoede/HOU/ECT@ECT    Subject: TVA/Gleason - second transmission credits doc  Elizabeth, we discussed this matter intenally yesterday, witht he following  conclusions:  We want to be able to apply Gleason Network credits to all transmission costs  (from all  TVA-related control areas) We want to be able to go negative on application of the credits - when  network upgrade invoices to Gleason have not  yet caught up to transmission  credit requests from all of the control areas. We do not want to make a monthly declaration of transmission requirements.   We need to agree with TVA on a process to keep track  of the credit usage and  balance.  We would like to go over them with you in our 2:30 pm meeting today - at the  controol room conference table.    Larry.     ---------------------- Forwarded by Larry Soderquist/HOU/ECT on 05/17/2000  09:30 AM ---------------------------   Ben F Jacoby 05/13/2000 11:11 AM Sent by: Ben Jacoby To: Larry Soderquist/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: Lloyd Will/HOU/ECT@ECT, Amy Copeland/HOU/ECT@ECT, Jody  Pierce/HOU/ECT@ECT, Tammy R Shepperd/HOU/ECT@ECT  Subject: Re: Ltr to Soderquist - Designate Recipients of Trans Credit    Larry:  Please make sure folks are up to speed on this. In any current month, the  amount of the transmission credit is equal to the then current amount of  capital costs paid by Gleason to TVA for the Shleby upgrade, less any  transmission credits previously used. I think the way to go is first to see  if we can use the credits to offset transmission charges from our other TVA  plants (on this point, TVA said no, but since Luke is out of the picture, we  should make another run at this). If that does not fly, (that is, if the  amount of credits we can use in any month is limited to the transmission  charges otherwise due from Gleason on the power it generates), we obviously  want to make sure we designate a credit amount equal to only as much as we  actually need.   Given that I believe we are the first IPP to be in this situation with TVA,  and given that TVA is to repay us in 2009 for the actual cost of the Shelby  upgrade less transmission credits actually used, we also need to make sure we  are accurately tracking both upgrade costs and transmission credits used, and  that TVA agrees with what we believe to be the correct balance. Jody Pierce  and Amy Copeland are aware of this, but I caution that we need to be  extremely careful given the amount of money involved. Toward this end, I have  asked Jody and Amy to make sure each TVA Shelby upgrade invoice is adequately  labelled as such by TVA before we make payments. I strongly suggest we put in  place a similar system for transmission credits whereby we receive TVA  signoff as part of the process Dennis To references below.  Please follow up with Jody, Amy, and Lloyd to make sure everyone is up to  speed on this as we proceed, and please make sure that an adequate process is  set up to account for transmission charges, credits, and balance of Shelby  upgrade costs.

PCA went into bankruptcy in 1998.  At the time of PCA's bankruptcy, PCA owed   a $5.3 million receivable to EPMI.   On EPMI's books, this uncollected  receivable amount was offset by an out-of-the money forward position EPMI had  with PCA which we were able to take to zero when PCA defaulted (contract  provided for one  way payments upon the occurrence of an event of default)  and some funds from credit.  After netting all these amounts,  there is still  a $600,000 receivable showing up as owed from PCA to EPMI.  Based on the  current bankruptcy proceedings, it is not likely that EPMI will receive any  additional funds from PCA (we have taken a very low key approach in the  bankruptcy due to the lack of PCA funds, the extensive amounts owed by PCA to  other creditors, the assertions being made by PCA against some of the other  creditors, and the legal effect of the one-way payment termination payment  that provided us a significant offset to the receivable).  Accordingly, unless I hear otherwise from you, I will talk to Leslie and tell  her to go ahead and clean up the $600,000  PCA receivable now, and in the  unlikely event PCA makes payments to any creditors,  we would then give such  amounts received from PCA back to you.   Call me if you have any questions.  Thanks Elizabeth  713 853 6349",tim.belden@enron.com,elizabeth.sager@enron.com,Receivable  Write-off -- Power Company of America (PCA),2000-06-19 04:54:00-07:00,sent

Maybe Bob can come up with  something.  Bill--Does TVA ever buy transmission on any other TP's system?  It must not  or it would have to file it Practices as a OATT with FERC.

"Hi Smith  If a six week delay in responding doesn't merit a big I'm sorry I don't know  what does.  My sincere apologizes in not responding sooner.  We have been looking for a power trading lawyer for about a year.  In March  Mark H. decided that since we couldn't find one outside that he would bring  in people internally.  Accordingly, back in April we had 3 internal lawyers  move into the group.  As a result of this shift,  we are not currently  looking for additional lawyers for power trading, but if things change I'll  let you know.  Just FYI, there may be openings in other areas (finance,  asset  development).  If you are interested, let me know and I'll call you  back.  Also, I know that power trading lawyers in general are in hot demand   ...  other organizations may be hiring.  I will be up in Portland, next  week.

"EPMI is entering into more and more transactions that are settled against a  floating, published index price.  Our physical contract does not currently  provide for what happens if the published source is not available or is  otherwise materially changed. Under ISDA for financial trading,  this is  addressed as a Market Disruption Event (MDE).  Under ENA's standard contract  for financial trading, there is included as a MDE ""the imposition of trading  limits on the range within which the price of the commodity may fluctuate"".   What this may mean is that if a cap is imposed on power prices, then in lieu  of using the capped price to determine the floating price, you would be  required (under ISDA) to eventually get brokers to determine what the price  would have been without the cap.  I want to add language to our physical contracts that addresses material  changes/disappearance of the published prices that would mirror the financial  trading terms and doubt whether we would want to make the imposition of a cap  on power prices a MDE.  If you treat the imposition of a cap (say in CA of  prices to $500 or in NEPOOL to $1,000) as a MDE, then we would be required to  secure quotes as to what the price would have been without the cap each time  that a pricing date trades at the cap level.   This only seems fraught with  litigation risk to me.  Alternatively, if caps are not deemed a MDE, then you  would always settle against the published prices, even if they are  ""artificially"" determined after the trade was entered into.  While caps are  not appealing, I think it would be better to not have the imposition of caps  be considered a MDE.  I have spoken with the financial trading group and they  will follow our lead on this.  So, depending upon what you both think, we  will make sure that financial and physical power are treated the same on this  issue.

"CONFIDENTIAL ATTORNEY/CLIENT INFORMATION NOT DISCOVERABLE  Two years after PCA's bankruptcy, we received a demand letter from PCA.  PCA  claims that EPMI owes PCA $15,126,445.16 for damages resulting from EPMI's  wrongful termination of transactions in June 1998.  This amount appears to be  based on PCA's calculation of the forward values of the terminated trades,  and certain ""preference payments"" that PCA claims were made to EPMI.  This  claim is in its preliminary stages.  I will update you with further  information as soon as we get a handle on what the Trustee is really  seeking.  As you will remember, we currently have a proof of claim pending  against PCA for over $5 million dollars representing our unpaid receivable  amount.  Bill  In connection with this matter, it would be very helpful if you could have  someone gather the following information:  1.  Date and amount of last payment made by PCA, splitting the relative net  amounts owed to and from EPMI (I would assume that payment for April  deliveries was made - accordingly, I would assume that the last payment we  received from PCA would have been around May 20th).  2.  Total amount of MWH delivered to PCA but for which PCA never paid for.  3.  The details of how you calculated the net MTM exposure of the terminated  transactions (pursuant to an email to me dated July 27, 1998 you had  calculated the MTM as of July 7, 1998 at $3,772,939)  As always, thanks for your help.","tim.belden@enron.com, william.bradford@enron.com",elizabeth.sager@enron.com,PCA Demand Letter,2000-08-14 05:26:00-07:00,sent

"Dynegy has requested a meeting with us to discuss what an ""Into Product"" is  and how this product works with what is currently going on with transmission  and how it may be impacted by future changes in transmission.  Attendees from  Dynegy will include Griff Jones (Dynegy's head of trading), Matt (whose last  name I didn't get) and their lawyer Harlan Murphy.  If you think somebody  else should attend or if you want them to come over here, let me know and I  can talk to Harlan.  Assuming the meeting stays scheduled, I will schedule an  internal meeting to briefly go over the EEI Into definition before we meet  with Dynegy.  As you are aware, in connection with the EEI effort we worked extensively  with a large group of industry participants to define  what an Into Product  is.  Dynegy and PECO were the two companies that were very outspoken against  they way the product ultimately got defined.  Dynegy put on a big dog and  pony show before a large group of industry participants trying to argue that  EEI's Into product was flawed.   Their position, while not completely  expressed, hinges on the concept that if you sell an Into Product and are  making deliveries on firm transmission, then the Seller will always be  excused from performance if the firm transmission gets cut for any reason (in  general, this is contrary to EEI which obligates the Seller to go to another  interface unless the cut was due to Buyer's use of non firm transmission when  firm was available or due to Buyer's attempt to move the energy away from the  receiving control area).  Dynegy's approach was driven by the fact that they  have extensive generation and that the vast majority of their deals go  physical.  At the time, we suggested that if they were worried about cuts in  firm transmission, then they needed to sell a transmission contingent  product.  Dynegy's concept was rejected at the EEI meetings.  I hope that the meeting will accomplish the following goals:  1.  Get Dynegy to agree to trade Into with us under a common Into definition  - Dynegy will not sign an EEI with us because of the Into definition.  We  trade Into extensively with them, but clearly do not have a common  understanding of what we are trading.  Critical to clear up this ambiguity.  2. Secure Dynegy as an advocate of EEI - Because Dynegy was so vocal against  EEI's Into definition, if they now started using EEI, it would further boost  acceptance of the contract and isolate PECO as the only other major voice  against the Into definition.  3. Reexamine the Into Product as it is currently drafted and consider what  will happen as access to transmission changes - Because the Into product is  such an important part of East trading today, it is critical that internally  we all agree how it should operate. Additionally, it is critical that we  start thinking about how the Into product will be affected by changes in  transmission, such as the advent of RTOs (with long term Into deals we may  want to consider addressing what happens if the receiving control area goes  into an RTO)  Call me with any questions/thoughts.

"Melanie  In general, Enron would prefer all matters with respect to power go to  arbitration for all issues.  When we first started trading power we limited  arbitration because we were uncertain where/how the market was going.   Accordingly, we limited arbitration to financial matters only.  I only raised  the issue last week because the scope of arbitration came up in another case  and we were uncertain whether an issue of proper termination would be subject  to the arbitration provision or not.  In conclusion, based on today's  policies (arbitrate everything), I would not think that there would be any  reason for us to be concerned with preserving  an argument of limited  applicability of the arbitration language found in the PCA Master.  I briefly reviewed your draft answer and will fax the comments to you shortly.

This form has been created using  the EEI form of master used by Enron North America, the Canadian gas master  and the British Energy Power Purchase Agreement.  Wherever possible and  particularly with respect to many of the procedural provisions, such as  billing, confirming, triggering events and the miscellaneous provisions, I  have used the language from the current form of Canadian gas master both to  create consistency between our Canadian gas and power businesses for our  operations, systems and accounting groups and to hopefully make it easier for  our commercial people to market the power paper to counterparties, as it will  be very similar in many respects to our form of gas master with which many  counterparties will already be familiar.  Regarding the power products tradeable under this master, further to a  discussion Peter and I had with Jeff Hodge and Christian Yoder, the products  described in Schedule A have been created based upon an amalgam of the EEI  products and the WSPP schedules of products.  Given the uncertainty of how  exactly the two Canadian markets that are set to open in 2001 will look, it  was determined best to have a minimum of broadly defined products, which will  be further defined over time as the markets develop, rather than trying to  introduce a large number of complex products that may end up neither  applicable nor appropriate and which would only serve to make negotiations of  the form with counterpartys more difficult.  I would ask each of you to review the form and provide me with any final  comments you may have at your earliest convenience so that Enron Canada can  commence marketing the paper to counterparties.  In performing your review,  please keep in mind that this master is intended to be an agreement that is  cross-jurisdictional and, therefor, general in scope and nature and will be  equally applicable to power trades in Alberta as in Ontario (or any other  province over time).  Any jurisdictional specific provisions will be built  into the confirms on a trade by trade basis.  Nevertheless, particularly for  Rob Hemstock and Aleck Dadson, I do want to ensure that we have not included  any provisions that may cause Enron Canada any concerns in Ontario or Alberta  based upon our current understanding of how those two regulatory regimes will  unfold.  Thanks for your assistance on this matter and I look forward to any comments  you may have on the document.

Andy Katz sent out the following message...We have had many  undeliverables...I would appreciate your letting me know if you receive this  message...thanks. Working Group Members:  The drafting commitee met on September 15 to discuss the status of the Master  Agreement and the agenda for the October 13 meeting at EEI's offices.  The  general consensus of the drafting committee is that the Master Agreement is  sound and there is no need for revision to the base terms and conditions of  version 2.1.  Based on that meeting, the drafting committee would like to  cover the following at the October 13 meeting :  GETTING CONTRACT IN PLACE.  The drafting committee believes that the number  one priority is to get the Master Agreement used by more participants in the  marketplace.   We would like to hear from the working group about the status  of the Master Agreement in their organizations and issues about the contract  that are holding up its use.  We will solicit suggestions on how to get wider  acceptance of the Master Agreement.  The drafting committee has thought of  holding another workshop in late January to address implementation issues  such as establsihing credit thresholds.  STANDARDIZED SUPPLEMENTAL PROVISIONS.  There are  several areas not addressed  in the base contract that are frequently used as customized supplemental  provisions identified on many parties' cover sheets.  The drafting committee  identified the following as useful to develop as suggested optional  supplemental provisions that could be used in negotiating a cover sheet with  a counterparty:   (1)  the incorporation of prior transactions as being  governed by the Master Agreement; (2) the use of the Master Agreement for  electronic trading; (3) alternative dispute resolution mechanisms; (4)  treatment of new taxes or changes in regulatory policy; (5) additional  products (e.g. Western firm or CAISO energy); (6) agreements with respect to  agency relationships; (7) ""regulatory out"" provisions; and (8) provisions  involving ""one-way"" counterparty relationships, i.e. sales only or purchases  only.  The drafting committee will ask the working group to allow it to develop  these provisions and once consensus on language is reached among the drafting  committee members, they would be made available for downloading on the EEI  website for use by the industry as suggested optional provisions.  We will  also discuss the ways to tie these provisions to the Master Agreement general  terms.   PROCEDURE FOR GETTING CONTRACT INTERPRETATION.  The drafting committee will  discuss ways to get answers about the contract disseminated quickly.  One  suggestion is to have a frequently asked questions section up on the EEI  website.  As a reminder, the meeting will be held from 10-4.  Please contact me if you  have any questions or comments about the agenda.   If you plan to attend or  need information about hotels or transportation, please contact Patricia  Young at 202-508-5757 or pyoung@eei.org. Thank-you.   Andrew S.

I have left that definition as a bullet and  we will need to fill it in or remove it, if the latter makes more sense.

Mark Powell will  be using this form of the agreement in conjunction with the current ENA form  of physical power GTC to prepare a Canadian form of physical power GTC that  may be used to transact physical power transactions of less than one year in  duration with counterparties with whom we do not have masters in place.

Recurring net income rose to $292 million or 34 cents per share from $223  million or 27 cents in the third quarter of 1999.

Oct. 16, 2000, 10:35PM Arena-backers promote plan to group of Hispanic leaders  By JANETTE RODRIGUES  Copyright 2000 Houston Chronicle  Pro-arena forces did some direct marketing to the Hispanic community Monday,  pitching the $175 million plan to a grass-roots group of Latino leaders.  More than 150 community activists and leaders, precinct judges and  civic-association members attended an informational meeting and  get-out-the-vote rally for the Nov. 7 arena referendum. The rally was  sponsored by the Let's Build It Together political action committee.  ""By having our Hispanic community come out in force for issues like this, it  empowers us,"" said Celina Garza-Ridge, a Harris County-Houston Sports  Authority director. ""It's very important to be able to say the Hispanic  community made a difference, and we are exactly in that position.""  George Postolos, the Houston Rockets' chief operating officer, said the team  is actively courting the Hispanic community.  The pro-arena committee, headed by former Reliant Energy Chairman Don Jordan,  and Ken Lay, Enron chairman and chief executive officer, does not want a  repeat of the 1999 referendum.  Voters last November soundly defeated the previous arena proposal. The sports  authority is a governmental body whose members are appointed by the city and  county to oversee and develop sports venues.  The Rockets made a 30-percent participation commitment, similar to the one  made four years ago by the Houston Astros for Enron Field, to fairly share  the new arena's design and construction jobs with minorities and women.  The team also promised to distribute up to $50,000 a year in neighborhood  improvement grants of up to $1,000 each to worthy grass-roots, nonprofit  organizations and civic clubs in inner-city Houston. The new program targets  the Hispanic community, Postolos said.  The new arena plan is being endorsed by a cross-section of Latino leaders,  including City Councilmen John Castillo and Gabriel Vasquez, state Rep. Mario  Gallegos, the Hispanic Chamber of Commerce and others.  Vasquez told meeting attendees that the city, and the Hispanic community, is  getting more tangibles this time around.  He said, ""When you consider that our community will get 30 percent  affirmative action, that our youth will be taken care of through youth  outreach programs and our neighborhoods will be taken care of as well, this  is a really good deal for Houston and this is a really good deal for the  Hispanic community.""  Mercedes Alejandro, who represents Parents for Public Schools of Houston,  heard the details of the plan for the first time.  ""It's good if it creates jobs for the community, and opportunities to rebuild  the community,"" she said. ""We want it to be good for the whole, not the few.""  Humberto Barrera, president of the Mexican American Sheriffs Organization,  was critical of Hispanic leaders, not the arena plan.  ""I think Hispanic leaders should be more concerned about issues like pay  raises for teachers, health care and public safety, than building arenas for  rich entrepreneurs,"" Barrera said.  Richard Torres, director and CEO of the Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, told  attendees that the Rockets are committed to doing the right thing.  Sergio Davila, president of the Eastwood Civic Association, brought up the  lack of Latinos in leadership positions on the team's staff. Postolos  acknowledged that the team needs to do better.         TVA Says Enron Breach Of Power Sales Pact Cost $140 Mln By Bryan Lee  10/16/2000 Dow Jones Energy Service (Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)  OF DOW JONES NEWSWIRES   WASHINGTON -(Dow Jones)- The nation's top two power providers are battling in  a U.S. court over an unexecuted power sales agreement. The Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) has filed a claim against the power  marketing unit of Enron Corp. (ENE) alleging breach of a power sales  contract.  TVA cited the alleged breach of contract in documents provided to its  distribution utility customers earlier this month outlining unforeseen  expenses contributing to the government-owned utility's inability to meet its  debt-reduction forecast.  According to the documents, obtained by Dow Jones Newswires, the alleged  breach of contract contributed to a $140 million shortfall during fiscal year  2000.  TVA was initially reluctant to divulge information on the case, which is  under a court protective order.  ""A major power provider elected not to perform under the contract,"" said  David Smith, TVA's chief financial officer, when asked Friday to elaborate on  the line item in the information provided to TVA's distribution utility  customers.  But after consulting with attorneys, Smith revealed that Enron was the  subject of the claim.  TVA alleged breach of contract after Enron sought a declaratory judgment  order from the U.S. District Court in Chattanooga, Tenn., in February,  stemming from a dispute over a long-term sales agreement, an Enron spokesman  said Monday.  In March, TVA filed a counter claim with the court alleging breach of  contract, a TVA spokesman said Monday.  But the two parties declined to discuss the terms of the contract, or to  elaborate further on the dispute, citing the judge's protective order. TVA  said Enron sought the court seal.  The dispute is the latest example of bad blood between the Houston-based  energy giant and TVA, a government-owned utility that ranks among the largest  U.S. power producers.  The relationship deteriorated after the two began squabbling over access to  the lucrative U.S. Midwest power market, which saw extreme price spikes  during hot weather in the summers of 1998 and 1999.  After the summer of 1998 - in which power that typically sells for between  $30 and $50 per megawatt-hour spiked as high as $7,000 per megawatt-hour -  Enron cited a study showing that TVA's power grid represented the only  unconstrained transmission pathways into the Midwest.  TVA experienced an increase in revenues for the period when power prices were  spiking upward.  Enron built gas-fired peaking power plants with an eye toward capitalizing on  the volatility in summer power markets by purchasing transmission access  across TVA's system.  After the summer of 1999 saw a repeat in extreme price volatility, Enron  began complaining that TVA was unfairly denying transmission service by  failing to act in a timely manner in response to transmission service  requests.  A TVA spokesman said the contract dispute was unrelated to the disagreement  over the government utility's handling of transmission-access requests.  But the filing of the court case occurred at the same time Enron went public  with its complaints about TVA's transmission service.  In February, Enron released a letter to Energy Secretary Bill Richardson  asking for the government's help, charging that TVA was unfairly giving its  own power marketer transmission service on a timely basis while Enron's  requests were gathering dust.  Enron later dropped the matter, saying that TVA was processing its  transmission service requests on a timely basis. -By Bryan Lee, Dow Jones  Newswires, 202-862-6647,  bryan.lee@dowjones.com   Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Net income rose to $292 million, or 34 cents a share, from profit from operations of $223 million, or 27 cents, in the year- earlier quarter.

HOUSTON, Oct 17 (Reuters) - Enron Corp., North America's biggest buyer and  seller of electricity and natural gas, said on Tuesday its third-quarter  earnings rose 31 percent, beating Wall Street's expectations as online  trading helped drive strong growth at its wholesale energy operations.  Recurring net income rose to $292 million or 34 cents per share from $223  million or 27 cents in the third quarter of 1999. Wall Street analysts had  expected earnings of 32 cents a share, according to First Call/Thomson  Financial.

""We operate in some of the largest and fastest growing markets in the world,  and we are very optimistic about the continued strong outlook for our  company,"" Lay added.  Enron, which has recently branched out beyond energy into fields such as  broadband telecommunications and metals trading, said third-quarter revenues  rose 154 percent to $30 billion compared with the same period of 1999.

Oct. 16, 2000, 10:35PM Arena-backers promote plan to group of Hispanic leaders  By JANETTE RODRIGUES  Copyright 2000 Houston Chronicle  Pro-arena forces did some direct marketing to the Hispanic community Monday,  pitching the $175 million plan to a grass-roots group of Latino leaders.  More than 150 community activists and leaders, precinct judges and  civic-association members attended an informational meeting and  get-out-the-vote rally for the Nov. 7 arena referendum. The rally was  sponsored by the Let's Build It Together political action committee.  ""By having our Hispanic community come out in force for issues like this, it  empowers us,"" said Celina Garza-Ridge, a Harris County-Houston Sports  Authority director. ""It's very important to be able to say the Hispanic  community made a difference, and we are exactly in that position.""  George Postolos, the Houston Rockets' chief operating officer, said the team  is actively courting the Hispanic community.  The pro-arena committee, headed by former Reliant Energy Chairman Don Jordan,  and Ken Lay, Enron chairman and chief executive officer, does not want a  repeat of the 1999 referendum.  Voters last November soundly defeated the previous arena proposal. The sports  authority is a governmental body whose members are appointed by the city and  county to oversee and develop sports venues.  The Rockets made a 30-percent participation commitment, similar to the one  made four years ago by the Houston Astros for Enron Field, to fairly share  the new arena's design and construction jobs with minorities and women.  The team also promised to distribute up to $50,000 a year in neighborhood  improvement grants of up to $1,000 each to worthy grass-roots, nonprofit  organizations and civic clubs in inner-city Houston. The new program targets  the Hispanic community, Postolos said.  The new arena plan is being endorsed by a cross-section of Latino leaders,  including City Councilmen John Castillo and Gabriel Vasquez, state Rep. Mario  Gallegos, the Hispanic Chamber of Commerce and others.  Vasquez told meeting attendees that the city, and the Hispanic community, is  getting more tangibles this time around.  He said, ""When you consider that our community will get 30 percent  affirmative action, that our youth will be taken care of through youth  outreach programs and our neighborhoods will be taken care of as well, this  is a really good deal for Houston and this is a really good deal for the  Hispanic community.""  Mercedes Alejandro, who represents Parents for Public Schools of Houston,  heard the details of the plan for the first time.  ""It's good if it creates jobs for the community, and opportunities to rebuild  the community,"" she said. ""We want it to be good for the whole, not the few.""  Humberto Barrera, president of the Mexican American Sheriffs Organization,  was critical of Hispanic leaders, not the arena plan.  ""I think Hispanic leaders should be more concerned about issues like pay  raises for teachers, health care and public safety, than building arenas for  rich entrepreneurs,"" Barrera said.  Richard Torres, director and CEO of the Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, told  attendees that the Rockets are committed to doing the right thing.  Sergio Davila, president of the Eastwood Civic Association, brought up the  lack of Latinos in leadership positions on the team's staff. Postolos  acknowledged that the team needs to do better.         TVA Says Enron Breach Of Power Sales Pact Cost $140 Mln By Bryan Lee  10/16/2000 Dow Jones Energy Service (Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)  OF DOW JONES NEWSWIRES   WASHINGTON -(Dow Jones)- The nation's top two power providers are battling in  a U.S. court over an unexecuted power sales agreement. The Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) has filed a claim against the power  marketing unit of Enron Corp. (ENE) alleging breach of a power sales  contract.  TVA cited the alleged breach of contract in documents provided to its  distribution utility customers earlier this month outlining unforeseen  expenses contributing to the government-owned utility's inability to meet its  debt-reduction forecast.  According to the documents, obtained by Dow Jones Newswires, the alleged  breach of contract contributed to a $140 million shortfall during fiscal year  2000.  TVA was initially reluctant to divulge information on the case, which is  under a court protective order.  ""A major power provider elected not to perform under the contract,"" said  David Smith, TVA's chief financial officer, when asked Friday to elaborate on  the line item in the information provided to TVA's distribution utility  customers.  But after consulting with attorneys, Smith revealed that Enron was the  subject of the claim.  TVA alleged breach of contract after Enron sought a declaratory judgment  order from the U.S. District Court in Chattanooga, Tenn., in February,  stemming from a dispute over a long-term sales agreement, an Enron spokesman  said Monday.  In March, TVA filed a counter claim with the court alleging breach of  contract, a TVA spokesman said Monday.  But the two parties declined to discuss the terms of the contract, or to  elaborate further on the dispute, citing the judge's protective order. TVA  said Enron sought the court seal.  The dispute is the latest example of bad blood between the Houston-based  energy giant and TVA, a government-owned utility that ranks among the largest  U.S. power producers.  The relationship deteriorated after the two began squabbling over access to  the lucrative U.S. Midwest power market, which saw extreme price spikes  during hot weather in the summers of 1998 and 1999.  After the summer of 1998 - in which power that typically sells for between  $30 and $50 per megawatt-hour spiked as high as $7,000 per megawatt-hour -  Enron cited a study showing that TVA's power grid represented the only  unconstrained transmission pathways into the Midwest.  TVA experienced an increase in revenues for the period when power prices were  spiking upward.  Enron built gas-fired peaking power plants with an eye toward capitalizing on  the volatility in summer power markets by purchasing transmission access  across TVA's system.  After the summer of 1999 saw a repeat in extreme price volatility, Enron  began complaining that TVA was unfairly denying transmission service by  failing to act in a timely manner in response to transmission service  requests.  A TVA spokesman said the contract dispute was unrelated to the disagreement  over the government utility's handling of transmission-access requests.  But the filing of the court case occurred at the same time Enron went public  with its complaints about TVA's transmission service.  In February, Enron released a letter to Energy Secretary Bill Richardson  asking for the government's help, charging that TVA was unfairly giving its  own power marketer transmission service on a timely basis while Enron's  requests were gathering dust.  Enron later dropped the matter, saying that TVA was processing its  transmission service requests on a timely basis. -By Bryan Lee, Dow Jones  Newswires, 202-862-6647,  bryan.lee@dowjones.com   Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

" FYI ----- Forwarded by Shari Stack/HOU/ECT on 10/19/00 01:03 PM -----   Christian Yoder  10/19/00 12:50 PM        To: Tracy Ngo/PDX/ECT@ECT, Shari Stack/HOU/ECT@ECT, Steve C Hall/PDX/ECT@ECT    cc:     Subject: Cal PX indmentity agreement  The CalPX ""Credit Redisign"" situation is an irritating mess that I am trying  to help straighten out.  Here is a summary of what is going on.  Please keep  this summary around and read it every time you get a question from a confused  individual  and feel free to forward it to whomever out there is confused  about things.  The CalPX  has a Surety bond with a big Surety entity.  The gist of the thing  is that If the PX ever gets into a situation where one of the players on its  exchange defaults, it can pick up the phone and call the  Surety and the  Surety will rush money to the PX withing 5 minutes, no questions asked.    Before the Surety agreed to do this bond with the PX they insisted that all  of the players that do business with the PX (called principals) sign  indemnity agreements with it.  The indemnity agreements basically say that if  the Surety ever has to pay a penny to the PX,, it can immediately call the  Principal and the principal will rush a penny to the Surety within 5.1  minutes.  The indemnity agreement says that the Principal must pay the Surety  upon demand for the share of the loss that it caused.  It also says a bunch  of stuff that makes it very clear that we might also have to pay money in  situations that are not our fault too.  It is a risky, bad agreement to sign  and in the first round of this stuff with the PX a year or so ago we did not  sign any indemnity agreement.  What happened instead was that Enron Corp  stepped in and saved the day.  It just so happens that Enron Corp. already  had a preexisting Indemnity Agreement with the Surety covering various  exposures at the 20,000 foot corporate level.  I was able to get the Enron  Corp bond people to talk to the Surety and the result was a two sentence  letter from the PX saying we were okay to trade.  We did not have to sign the  indemnity agreement.  I did not negotiate any of the terms  between Corp and  the PX on this.   That is the history.  Now we come to the PX's new ""Credit Redisign.""   The PX  is anxious that it is not covered well enough.  So, out they come with  exactly the same set of documents demanding that everybody sign another  indemnity agreement.  Like a trained dog, I have just been trying to do the  same thing I did last time.  I have called Corp and tried to get them to make  the issue go away the same way they did last time.  Unfortunately there are  different people involved now and I have not been very aggressive about  telling the story and getting eveybody to work together.  I am now back from  a nice littel vacation and promise to push the thing through Corp. as best I  can.  I have already left two voice mails and will faithfully and doggedly  try to take care of this.  ----cgy",elizabeth.sager@enron.com,shari.stack@enron.com,Cal PX indmentity agreement,2000-10-19 06:05:00-07:00,received

I think it may be helpful if Elizabeth Sager is available on Wednesday to go over the how Enron calculated the Termination Payment (I know the payment was zero, but the amount of ""Gains"" to Enron under the Master Agreement may have some bearing in connection with their unjust enrichment claims) and her calculation of Enron's gain from selling the power otherwise deliverable to  PCA in the market after the Master Agreement was terminated.  Elizabeth has recalculated the proper amount of EPMI's proof of claim, and it appears that  the original proof of claim was overstated a bit.  You may have all this information -- but if not, Elizabeth does and we should get our arms around it.  I'm going to be messengering to you today the Trust's mediation statement  filed in connection with the other defendants.  I only have a fax, and if I fax it  to you, you won't be able to read it.  It would be beneficial for you to review this statement as it sets forth the Trustee's position in more detail.    It provides the basis for their claim of unjust enrichment, even though I  continue to believe that unjust enrichment is not available in connection with the  Master Agreement and EPMI's termination for unpaid invoices.  I also think it would be helpful to connect Liz Austin into our conversation  on Wednesday so that she can advise you of her experience in mediating with the Trustee.  She has represented at least one other defendant who mediated with  the Trust successfully.  Her insights of what to expect will be helpful.

Preliminary feedback from  the customer has been positive, so I am hopeful that we will come to mutually  agreeable pricing and terms on this transaction.   I should get some  additional feedback sometime today.   I have raised the flag with the customer that we need to put paper and credit  terms in place, and given their desire to close on this quickly, we will  likely need to move quickly on this today/tomorrow.   As for cedit, their  consultant indicated that a corp guarantee from the Black Hill Power Corp  parent is probably not the customer's preferred approach, but rather credit  arrangements tagged specifically to the project.  The project is owned by  Black Hills Energy Capital, which invests in power projects through some sort  of investment fund.  Their consultant speculated that Enron might have some  interests in that investment fund relating to some projects out West, but he  wasn't sure.   In any event, depending on their desire to move forward with  us, we will need to be ready to talk credit/contract with them on short  notice.

"I also think this is a great idea - there would be a tremendous benefit if  the EEI contract became the standard for on-line trading platforms.  While  Enron currently uses simplified GTCs for trading online with those  counterparties with whom we do not have a Master Power Trading Contract (if  we do that agreement governs power trades), we have talked about and likely  will eventually make the EEI contract the ""default"" contract if there are no  other arrangements in place.  I would fully support and provide any  assistance to pursue this idea with and through EEI.     drusso@reliantenergy.com  10/30/2000 06:07 PM        To: ""Pooya, Babak"" <Babak.Pooya@SouthernEnergy.Com>    cc: ""'Andy Katz'"" <AKatz@eei.org>, fmdutton@aep.com, hemu@dynegy.com,  elizabeth.sager@enron.com, bbrou91@entergy.com, mroger3@entergy.com,  wfhenze@jonesday.com, dperlman@powersrc.com, rosteen@powersrc.com,  drusso@reliantenergy.com, pdondanville@schiffhardin.com, ""Pooya, Babak""  <Babak.Pooya@SouthernEnergy.Com>, ""Edmonds, Sonnet""  <sonnet.edmonds@SouthernEnergy.Com>    Subject: RE: Oct 13 Meeting Follow-Up    GREAT IDEA!!!

Separately, I understand that we intend to emphasize marketing efforts towards all potential EEI users, but utilities in particular due to that group's lower acceptance rate to date.  Another ""group"" to which I believe that we should emphasize our marketing efforts includes the online trading platforms.  Three types of online trading platforms presently exist: (1)proprietary exchanges (EnronOnline, Dynegydirect); (2) consortium platforms (ICEX); and (3) independent, third-party platform (Altra) [these platforms are similar to (2)but differ in that the shareholders/backers have not committed liquidity].  The volumes traded on these types of electric platforms are significant and growing.  According to MegawattDaily, Ameren Energy conducts about 40% of next-day deals and 30% of forwards on various electronic platforms.  There are presently close to 25 platforms (of course, with so many competitors, as usually happens, there will probably be a weeding out and/or consolidations/mergers...the Jurassic period notwithstanding, as blame for the mass dinosaur extinction lay with an errant meteor or possibly the taking up of cigarette smoking by the majority of the dinosaurs according to Larsen...all apologies for the joke).  As each platform system has different definitions, products, and contracts, and as several of the platforms are considering adopting standard contracts, I believe an opportunity exists to push the EEI as either the exclusive standard agreement used for trading on a particular platform or as a default agreement for those proprietary and other platforms under which trading partners lack executed Masters with the counterparty.  In fact, according to published sources, Houston Street, RedMeteor, and others have been working with others for several months on developing industry standards.  Just a thought.

Bill McCoy should have draft language by early next week.  This draft only addresses EEI transactions, but could easily be expanded to transactions under other master agreements.  I will circulate Bill's draft as soon as I get it. Randy Baker & Michelle McLendin (Duke), and Lisa Grof & Frank Hilton (AEP) have volunteered to work on the on the credit annex subcommittee.  According to my notes, assignments for the remaining optional provisions are as follows:  1) Incorporating old  trades - Elizabeth 2) One-way transactions - Buddy 3) New products e.g. Western Firm/CAISO - Dede & Elizabeth 4) Regulatory Out - John Crespo & Randy Osteen 5) New taxes - Fritz 6) ADR - Patty 7) Agency relationship - Elizabeth 8) Electronic Exchanges - Babak  Additional provisions 9) Credit Annex - Bill McCoy, et al. 10) incorporating prior trades not under netting, Frank Stllingwerf 11) Broker Confirmations ? 12) Over Deliveries - Phyliss Lemel  What kind of deadline for these assignments is realistic?  Randy Osteen & I plan to meet next w/ week to start planning the workshop in Atlanta we plan to hold at the end of January.  If anyone has ideas for the program please let us know.  I plan to fix up the contract web page next week  Sterling Koch of TransAlta said he would like to set up a presentation opportunity for an EEI contract representative to talk to the Canadian standardization group.  Finally, EEI has a block of rooms and meeting space at the Four Seasons in Newport Bearch, CA for our Legal Committee from April 18-21.  We would like to shorten our meeting to two days.

The paper is relevant to what we are focussing on now with EPSA, and  discusses: what is happening in the US and English markets, the legal issues in merchant power sale contracts, the EEI agreement (on which Enron's EPSA is largely  based, or was it vice versa), and compliance issues.  A few of points I found particularly interesting:  * The way in which many of the risks are born seems to be reasonably settled in the US market/EEI form.  The issue is to what extent Japan will/should follow the same allocation, on which subject the Enron EPSA seems  to be setting the pace, at least for the moment.  * We cannot discount the danger that some of the counterparties in Japan will in fact become insolvent or choose not to perform.  We have attempted to cover this in EPSA.  * The treatment of force majeure, particularly non-performance by the back-to-back supplier/customer, will need more attention as specific fact situations arise.  * The need for a commercial/legal response system to be in place to immediately address any failures.  I hope you find the paper useful and, as discussed, I rely on you to  distribute it to other persons within Enron who are likely to be interested.

"I'm glad you cancelled.   I agree that the changes are much broader than we  intended.  More importantly, I miss having not played tennis this week, and I'm going to  DC this weekend, and likely out next week.  A short interlude but that's all.  On an EEI note, are you/Reliant going to the meeting in Ontario that is  addressing contract issues in Ontario (Andy is speaking about EEI).  Are you  supporting the use of EEI in Canada.  I think I have our Canadian office  convinced to use it with dealers but they would want to ""Canadianize"" it,  thereby creating an EEI Canadian.  Any thoughts.

"Here is a report on current Muni deals in the west.    1. Grant County PUD:  (Washington)   we have orally agreed (no signed  confirms) to two identical deals,  each calls for us to deliver power to  Grant during year one and for Grant to deliver us power and money in year 4  or 5.  Our effort to get an opinion from them that these deals have been  properly authorized has foundered badly.  We have the classic situation of a  PUD whose procedural practice does not fit with the statute.  They are  irritated to have this pointed out to them and so far, unwilling to go back  and fix their practices for fear of embarassment before the Board.   Delicate,  complex, difficult mess.  Pat Boylston of Stoel Rives helping.     2.  Clatskanie: (Oregon)  We have done a deal ( signed confirms and EEI soon  to be signed) whereby we deliver Clatskanie power in year 1, for which we  receive a monthly payment which is roughly akin to a contract price,  and  they deliver us power in year 5.   We have every expectation of receiving a  satisfactory legal opinion from them when they return the signed EEI  agreement.  3. EWEB: (Oregon)   We have done a deal (being documented as a swap by the  swap group) which I believe is a five year deal.  The deal was originally  conceived as being a physical transaction.  We  received satisfactory  documentation about authorization from EWEB for the physical transaction, but  when it switched over to being a swap at the last minute,  and Sara  subsequently reviewed the authorization issue,  her conclusion was that we  were not satisfied with what EWEB had shown us.  I have gotten Pat Boylston   to get EWEB to promise to give us a Board resolution in a couple of weeks  addressing the financial risk concern.    4. Valley Coop. (Nevada)  We have recently done a 4 year vanilla commodity  sale to Valley and are in the process of checking out their authorization to  do longer term deals.   We have a services agreement with them whereby we are  their SC for load balancing purposes involving the California market.  A  question has arisen as to whether or not certain sales we make to them as  part of this arrangement  may generate revenue for them in excess of 15%,  if  so, perhaps putting their tax exempt status as a muni in jeopardy.  It is a  tax, accounting issue.  Pat Boylston of Stoel Rives is helping us sort it out.  5. LMUD (California)  City of Lassen.  We are trying to do a long term sale  of power to them.  Attempts to check out authorization have run into a  complex, California municipality statute and a small town lawyer and we are  presently stalled out.  Sandy Skaggs of McCutcheon Doyle is helping as best  he can.  The commercial deal died its first death yesterday but rigor mortis  is not complete and we may have to revive authorization efforts.  6.  Tracy Ngo has given us a long list of munis, prioritized as to our credit  exposure to them.  Presumably I am busy checking all of the most serious ones  out and making sure we have proper authorizations.  In fact, I have done  nothing with this  because I am busy with other immediate priorities.    Pat Boylston of Stoel Rives and Sandy Skaggs of McCutcheon Doyle are  providing very valuable service in this area.  They are both very good at  dealing with these muni type folks and, with the exception of Grant, (and not  because of Pat, who has been great)  have gotten fairly good results so  far.----cgy",elizabeth.sager@enron.com,christian.yoder@enron.com,Muni Summary,2000-11-07 01:16:00-08:00,received

"Elizabeth, I am responding to your voice mail that today's meeting is  canceled.  I agree with your suggestion that you, Mark, Jeff, Bill and Shari  can come to a conclusion and just let us know.  I believe the issues come down to:  1. risk of intentional default by our counterparty  2. risk of unintentional default by us  3. what the market is doing  As agreed at our last call, I reviewed the issues commercially here, and I  believe the commercial preference is to maintain cherry picking for the  reasons in 1 above.

"Elizabeth, in Mark's legal conference call this morning you updated your  meeting in Toronto.  Gaffney spoke to me last week after the meeting and his  summary was in essence the same as yours.  My thoughts which I passed along  to Chris were:  1.  I do not agree with OPGI's contention that the Ontario market will be  financial only.  I have crossed this issue a number of times in Ontario, and  believe that this assertion is ill-conceived and would not be agreed to by  those familiar with the developing market rules.  Most notably, Aleck Dadson  of the Government Affairs group in Toronto knows the market rules as they  currently stand as well as any one in the market, and Rob Milnthorp is on the  Board of the IMO.  Both would, I believe, agree that there is a distinction  as to how the IMO-controlled market will operate and physical bilateral OTC  contracting.  Operationally, the IMO-controlled market will be set up as a  pool mechanism where physical bilats are permitted and indeed contemplated,  but if there are deficiencies in physical delivery/receipt obligations those  will be settled through the pool.  This does not mean, however, that, in  terms of legal obligations, there is not a physical delivery obligation and  all that goes with it (such as force majeure, etc).  Nor is the settlement in  the pool costless to the non-defaulting party (prudential requirements,  etc).  To the extent that a party wants to rely on the pool to settle the  deficiencies, and subject to issues such as compensating the non-defaulting  party for any increased prudentials and other associated costs, there is  still a physical bilat and the party with the delivery obligation can rely,  if it chooses, on the contractula obligation to deliver ""or cause to be  delivered"" the energy.  In other words, I distinguish how the pool operates  from the nature of the legal obligations.  2.  I think the issue of force majeure needs to be reconsidered along the  lines originally proposed by Greg.  For pool level deliveries, whether in gas  or in power, we (Canada) have always restricted force majeure to failure of  the pool if it affects everyone transacting at the pool.  This is the type of  force majeure we use for ""NIT"" or ""Hub"" delivery obligations in gas, and is  the type of force majeure Greg envisioned for the Alberta Power Pool and the  IMO-Controlled Grid. This type of force majeure eliminates force majeure risk  from our portfolio, as we therefore are never long or short as a result of  force majeure.  If we are transacting at a point outside of the pool, that  will be the exception and not the rule, and should be dealt with specifically  in the transaction Confirm.  This is how we handle our gas business as set up  by Lavorato.  3.  Aleck Dadson should attend the next meeting (if not all meetings) with  Chris to answer to any market rule issues.  4.  Please involve Greg in your discusions on the form of Master that is  developed.  Peter.",elizabeth.sager@enron.com,peter.keohane@enron.com,Ontario Master Project,2000-11-13 07:29:00-08:00,received

"Peter, just a follow-up to your email.  1.  I would agree that OPG is mistaken.  After the meeting, Chris and I and  others started the process of explaining to Joel Sheinfied, a contract  administrator, why deliveries in a pool situation were not just financial  settlements but involved a physical commitment to deliver or cause to be  delivered power.  On this issue I think it would be helpful to present OPG w/  a product definition that works with the physical master.  I know Chris is  already working on this.  From what it sounds like, the Ontario pool is not  that different from NEPOOL.  In UI, Chris worked on a product definition that  you could incorporate into the physical master.  2. I also agree that in pools, a fm will only exist when the pool fails and  there are no deliveries capable of being made (not a single MW flowing).    This is what we did in UI.  This is what we do in the California pool.  This  is what we attempt to do in NEPOOL.  I think the EEI fm gets you to the same  place (nobody could call fm if the pool were making deliveries) but agree  that the language could be more direct.  With the California product (CAISO  energy) we expressly modify the EEI fm since there are so many other things  we also have to fix.  We likely in the future will also modify fm for the  NEPOOL product but we are still trying to introduce so many other products in  the US that this is a change for the near future.  In general, fm is unique  to the product and I believe will change with each product.  When Chris and I  were talking to OPG we told them that the fm we would be proposing for the  Ontario product would be just as you stated:  Fm is only possible if the pool  fails.  Just FYI, the god awful ""Into""product in the US was created by Enron  for the very reason you stated: we wanted to eliminate fm risk in a non-pool  market - we did this by obligating the seller to continuously be required to  change delivery points (and not be allowed to call a fm) within the defined  control area if for any reason the prescheduled delivery point was  unavailable.

"           Attorney Work Product/Not Discoverable  Top Legal Risks  1.  Power Forms -  Trading contracts in the power industry are very weak.   Typical problems include, trading under multiple masters, no liquidated  damages for non-delivery, no events of default or calculation of termination  damages, broad performance outs.  2. Agency - Several of our major trading partners operate through an agent  acting on behalf of several operating companies. This creates uncertainty as  to which entity is liable for which trades.  3. Municipalities - Difficult authorization issues associated municipalities.  4.Complexity of transactions - Power transactions can be very complex as a  result, in part, of difficult delivery mechanics and volatile pricing.  5.Timing of transactions - Power transactions typically must be completed on  a very tight time schedule.  6. Lawyer Training - Difficult, time consuming process to train lawyers on  how to document transactions involving power.  7.Process for approval of transactions - Uncertain procedures for making sure  everybody understands risks associated with transactions.  Documentation Projects  1.  EEI - cont'd work to make EEI the trading contract for power/lessen  reliance on WSPP.  2.  One-off Power Form - creation of contract to be used for individual  transactions that are not part of a master.  3. Product Definition - cont'd work on creating/building acceptance for power  product definitions.  4. Platform Trading - Encourage use of EEI as trading platform for all  e-trading.  5. Single master contract for all physical commodities/financial trading  -   work with ISDA to develop single contract for physical trading and then roll  that into single contract for physical and financial trading",mark.haedicke@enron.com,elizabeth.sager@enron.com,Quarterly Legal Review -Power,2000-11-28 01:46:00-08:00,sent

LOS ANGELES -(Dow Jones)- A second lawsuit is being filed in San Diego  Superior Court Wednesday against Enron alleging the company, and others,  overcharged California consumers more than $4 billion for electricity  service.  On Monday, a similar suit was filed against Dynegy Inc. (DYN), Reliant Energy  Inc. (REI), Duke Energy North America (DUK), Southern Energy Company (SO),  AES Corp., Williams Energy and NRG Energy. Both lawsuits are seeking class  action status and may be consolidated into one complaint.  The complaints allege unfair trade practices and illegal trust activity. A  news conference announcing the details of the lawsuit will be held Wednesday  morning in San Diego. Enron does not own or operate major generating units in the state, but is  active in trading electricity here and securing long-term fixed rate  contracts for large industrial customers. At times, Enron sells power back  into the California Power Exchange, the market where power is bought and sold  in the state.  An Enron representative said he has not yet seen the lawsuit and was unable  to comment.  The lawsuits claim Enron and the other energy companies withheld power supply  last summer, created shortages by selling power out of state and used  real-time confidential data about power plant activity to drive up prices.  The lawsuits are an attempt to force generators to refund about $4 billion  for electricity, the amount consumers were allegedly overcharged. -By Jason  Leopold; Dow Jones Newswires; 323-658-3874; jason.leopold@dowjones.com   Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

The paper is relevant to what we are focussing on now with EPSA, and  discusses: what is happening in the US and English markets, the legal issues in merchant power sale contracts, the EEI agreement (on which Enron's EPSA is largely  based, or was it vice versa), and compliance issues.  A few of points I found particularly interesting:  * The way in which many of the risks are born seems to be reasonably settled in the US market/EEI form.  The issue is to what extent Japan will/should follow the same allocation, on which subject the Enron EPSA seems  to be setting the pace, at least for the moment.  * We cannot discount the danger that some of the counterparties in Japan will in fact become insolvent or choose not to perform.  We have attempted to cover this in EPSA.  * The treatment of force majeure, particularly non-performance by the back-to-back supplier/customer, will need more attention as specific fact situations arise.  * The need for a commercial/legal response system to be in place to immediately address any failures.  I hope you find the paper useful and, as discussed, I rely on you to  distribute it to other persons within Enron who are likely to be interested.

"Dear Elizabeth---Just wanted you to know I truly enjoyed meeting you today. Thank you for taking the time to learn more about my background and to share your Enron experience with me.  On reflection, I still think Enron is more of a financial company than a tech company - tech/broadband is just one of Enron's many facets.  A few years ago I think Enron was having trouble deciding whether it was an energy company or a financial company - and settled on the latter to chart its direction.  I think Enron's innovative processes and approaches to problem solving are what make the prospect of working with you so exciting.  I am most interested in the available opportunity and look forward to hearing from you soon,  Alice Ginsburgh",elizabeth.sager@enron.com,arlgin48@aol.com,Enjoyed meeting you,2000-11-30 15:06:00-08:00,received

"Elizabeth, For various reasons, and from time to time,  these new RTO-type things come  to legal because we presumably have some special ""corporate law"" expertise  about board compostition and by-laws.  I'm not sure we do, but in any event,   Steve and I have reviewed this three inch pile of paper and our conclusions  are set forth below.  If you would like us to do anything further, please let  us know. ----cgy ---------------------- Forwarded by Christian Yoder/HOU/ECT on 12/01/2000  02:11 PM ---------------------------   Steve C Hall 11/30/2000 05:17 PM To: Christian Yoder/HOU/ECT@ECT cc:   Subject: Western Connection Interface (WIO)  Christian,  Earlier this week you asked me to review a stack of documents (proposals and  draft bylaws) relating to the proposed Western Interconnection Organization.    Conclusion:  Based upon a quick review of the draft proposal, bylaws, and  other materials, I see no major objections to Enron voting for the formation  of the WIO.   The reason to vote for this organization would be to facilitate  the development of uniform reliability standards and efficient electric  markets in the Western Interconnection.  However, you should carefully  consider the fact that the board of directors will be weighted towards  transmission owners (who will have 8 of the 27 votes).  Power marketers,  generators, and load-serving entities will only have 4 votes.  14 directors  establish a quorum and the board only requires a majority vote of directors  present, so it is conceivable that, for example, 15 directors show up, 8 of  which are transmission owners, and the transmission owners are able to pass  any resoultion they wish.  Related to this issue is the inability of one  membership group, such as the power marketer's group, to be able to veto a  proposal.  It will take three membership classes acting in unison, plus two  other votes, to defeat a proposed action by the board.  Unfortunately,  because I am not personally familiar with the internal dynamics of the WSCC  membership, I am unable to offer any indication of the how much of a risk  this presents.           Background and Overview In General:  The Western Interconnection Organization (""WIO"") will be formed  by consolidating the Western Regional Transmission Association, the  Southwestern Regional Transmission Association, the Northwestern Regional  Transmission Association, and the Western States Coordinating Council (WRTA,  SWRTA, NRTA, and WSCC, respectively) into one organization.  The WIO, a  non-profit corporation, will assume and perform the functions of these  organizations, and, eventually, those organizations will be disbanded.  The principal responsibilities of the WIO will be as follows:   *The WIO will be the primary authority for promulgating regional  reliability, operating, and procedural standards.  *The WIO will work to resolve conflicting regional reliability standards,  and work to develop compatible and efficient practices throughout the Western  Interconnection.  *The WIO will have no authority over commercial practices (but may work to  promote compatible, efficient markets).  *Provide a process for resolving disputes arising out of WIO functions and  between WIO members.  Membership:  Any entity meeting the criteria for membership in one of the following  membership classes may be Member of the WIO.  There are five classes of  membership:  (1) Business entities owning more than 1000 miles of  transmission lines, (2) Business entities owning less than 1000 miles of  transmission lines; (3) Business entities that do not own, control, or  operate transmission or distribution lines, e.g., power marketers,  load-serving entities, independent power producers; (4) End users of  electricity; and (5) Representatives of States and Provinces in the Western  Interconnection.   *Each class elects four (4) directors.  *All of the classes select seven (7) non-affiliated directors, for a total  of twenty-seven (27) directors.   Quorum:  A majority of all members, including a majority in at least three  classes.  In the case of directors, there must be 14 directors.  Board Decisions:  A board decision requires a majority of the directors  present.  Standing Committees:  There are three standing committees:  the Planning  Coordination Committee, the Operating Committee, and the Market Interface  Committee.    Committee Voting:  For purposes of voting on recommendations to the board,  committees are divided into three classes:  (1) transmission providers, (2)  transmission customers, and (3) States and Provincial Members (which is Class  5). In order to make a recommendation to the board, there must be a simple  majority of votes from the transmission provider and transmission customer  classes.  Termination:  The WIO can be terminated upon a vote of the majority of the  members.

"FYI ----- Forwarded by Shari Stack/HOU/ECT on 12/04/2000 10:50 AM -----   Tom May@ENRON  12/04/2000 12:46 AM        To: Howard Fromer/NA/Enron@Enron, Christi L Nicolay/HOU/ECT@ECT, SARAH  NOVASEL, Sara Shackleton/HOU/ECT@ECT, Shari Stack/HOU/ECT@ECT    cc: Mark Dana Davis/HOU/ECT@ECT, Robert Stalford/NA/Enron@Enron, Thresa A  Allen/HOU/ECT@ECT, Rebecca M Grace/HOU/ECT@ECT    Subject: NYISO - Still problems with 10/29/00 - DRE-004-11/1500  Folks,  It appears from the comment below that the NYISO does not intend to revise  October's bill until February 2001.  This is a very signifigant issue for  Enron.  Recall that the NYISO intentionally billed for October with the  incorrect prices for the proxy busses even though the prices had been revised  on the NYISO web site for some time prior to the bill.  The impact of this  was that the NYISO withheld about $3,000,000.00 from Enron for October.  In  addition they have not updated the November bill to reflect revised prices  and the payment date is approaching.  When asked about this last month, the  NYISO indicated that they knew they were billing incorrectly and would rebill  later but that, according to the tarriff, market participants must settle  there bills as posted.  I believe this to be a blatent abuse of the tarriff  and that the NYISO is intentionally ""leaning"" on market participants for  credit.  With year end approaching I believe that there is an emphasis on  maximizing working capital which makes this even more critical (this point is  highly confidential).  I believe that if they are not going to address this with the November bill  than we should be taking the most aggressive response.  Should we put this in  an intervention to the NYSEG filing regarding payments  to the NYISO or  should we file separately with FERC requesting as a separate issue?  What  would get the quickest response?  Can and should we consider legal action  outright?  Howard,  can you approach the NYISO at highest levels ASAP with this issue  and find out if there is any intention to address this?  So much for there  efforts to gain credibility in the Marketplace.  Following Howards inquiry, I suggest that we meet by phone to determine our  course of action.  We have very little time if we have any hope of confincing  them of revising the bill with the November billing due around the 15th.  On a similar issue, NYISO is asking us to repay $4.6 million in TCC revenues  from earlier this year.  I believe that they must revise prices in order for  them to do this and that they are outside the window for revising prices.  Howard, can you arrange for Sara Shackleton and Shari Stack to get the TCC  rules that were in effect prior to August as well as any rules around price  revisions.  Thanks, Tom.   ---------------------- Forwarded by Tom May/Corp/Enron on 12/03/2000 11:54 PM  ---------------------------          From:  Rebecca M Grace @ ECT                           11/30/2000 09:51 AM    To: Tom May/Corp/Enron@Enron cc: Thresa A Allen/HOU/ECT@ECT   Subject: NYISO - Still problems with 10/29/00 - DRE-004-11/1500  FYI -  ---------------------- Forwarded by Rebecca M Grace/HOU/ECT on 11/30/2000  09:45 AM ---------------------------   devanoski@nyiso.com on 11/29/2000 06:23:04 AM To: rgrace@enron.com cc:   Subject: NYISO - Still problems with 10/29/00 - DRE-004-11/1500     Response:  Rebecca, Due to a coding error in calculating ancillary reserves for the 25 hour day (Oct. 29), hour 1 was not charged on the bill and was overwritten by hour 2  data and all remaining hours were shifted up one hour.

One area that has concerned me is the possibility of  a claim by our CA counterparty that we developed an idea using in part their  information, when in fact we independently developed the concept.  have seen  some CA's that expressly address this as an exception to the definition of  Confidential Information. Also, how should we address the point Mark raised  about the development of ideas jointly while in discussions with the  counterparty. I Let's get together to talk further about this next week when Mark G. gets  back from Canada.  I'll set up the meeting.  Alan     Marcus Nettelton@ENRON  11/29/2000 05:40 PM       To: Mark Greenberg/NA/Enron@ENRON    cc: Alan Aronowitz/HOU/ECT@ECT    Subject: Re: Intellectual Property Rights Protection in Confidentiality  Agreements  Not quite sure what you mean by ""information developed"" from a value or  exploitation perspective, or understand the exposure you believe we have  under our existing, well drafted confidentiality agreements, to which I take  no credit whatsoever, unfortunately.   We should not be using the information disclosed by a counterparty for any   purpose other than to evaluate and negotiate any possible transaction with  that counterparty. To use it for any other purpose would be in breach of the  confidentiality agreement. Since we are discussing the information and  disclosing it to each other it is caught by the confidentiality undertakings.    If we develop any  information independently without the benefit of any  confidential information received from the disclosing counterparty, then of  course we can claim it as ours, before expiry of the term of the  confidentiality agreement, and protect it accordingly and the counterparty  would have to establish that we did not develop it independently without the  benefit of their confidential information.   During the period of the confidentiality agreement, ownership of information  that we developed using a counterparty's confidential information is not an  issue, since we can only use it for the purposes set out in the relevant  confidentiality agreement. If we want to use it for any other purpose, during  the term of the confidentiality agreement, we will need to reach agreement  with the counterparty as to any rights for exploitation in a substantive  agreement, recognising that we may will be mixing intellectual property  rights.     Regards   Marcus       Mark Greenberg 11/27/2000 04:46 PM To: Alan Aronowitz/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: Marcus Nettelton/NA/Enron@ENRON   Subject: Re: Intellectual Property Rights Protection in Confidentiality  Agreements    Alan -  I agree that we need to make some revisions and, having read Marcus'  comments, I agree also that broad language covers the general concepts.  I  believe ownership of information developed during discussions will be the hot  area, especially where we are discussing projects with companies while we  developed parallel projects.  These situations make Enron an easy target.    Though the general language of the agreement covers this generally, enhanced  language should be considered.

"Elizabeth -- Three comments to consider:  In the first change, I think that I understand your change, but my impression  was that ""provided for in this Confirmation"" was referring or tieing  specifically to the ""deal"" defined in the Confirmation, therefore the change  to say ""may be agreed to"" seems to weaken that reference.  On the 10th line, does adding the word ""firm"" in front of energy potentially  conflict with the specific transaction if it is something more or something  different than a simple firm deal.  Shouldn't the level of firmness be fully  defined elsewhere in the confirm.  In (b), suggest adding some reference to quantity after your reference to  timing along these lines:  "" (b)  the starting and ending time and date, and  the quantity of the release or interruption;""     Since partial quantity  releases are possible/likely, probably even successive releases (due to  gradual weather changes)  it would be equally as important to identify  quantity and timing.  Example:  start with 200 MW for the month, release 50  MW starting day 10 for balance of month, then another 50 MW over a weekend.  As always, thanks for your assistance. -- David       Joseph Wagner@ENRON 12/06/2000 02:57 PM To: David Fairley/HOU/ECT@ECT, Kyle Schultz/HOU/ECT@ECT, Rogers  Herndon/HOU/ECT@ect cc:   Subject: Re: FW: optout language   ---------------------- Forwarded by Joseph Wagner/NA/Enron on 12/06/2000  02:55 PM --------------------------- From: Elizabeth Sager@ECT on 12/06/2000 02:53 PM To: Joseph Wagner/NA/Enron@ENRON cc:    Subject: Re: FW: optout language    Attached is TVA language, to which I made a few changes.

"Here is the email I told you about...I'll forward you a voice mail he left me  on this subject and have him get in touch with you directly to get you a copy  of the PPA and discuss the issue ----- Forwarded by Dan Lyons/HOU/ECT on 12/07/2000 01:39 PM -----   Garrick Hill  12/07/2000 10:29 AM        To: Dan Lyons/HOU/ECT@ECT    cc: Douglas Clifford/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Charles Ward/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Dan  Lyons/HOU/ECT@ECT, Mike Mazowita/Corp/Enron@Enron, John King/HOU/ECT@ECT    Subject: MPLP Capacity Charges  THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION HAS BEEN PREPARED AT THE REQUEST OF COUNSEL:  Per the voicemail I left you yesterday concerning the billing of capacity  charges by Consumers for electric service provided by MPLP:  Background  MPLP went into service on October 1, 1995 and provides service under a PPA  for a term that ends September 30, 2030.  Capacity charges are billed under  Section 10(a) of the PPA, which references a schedule of capacity rates  provided as Exhibit D.  Exhibit D:  (1) shows Consumers' avoided cost rates  for 35 years and (2) converts these rates into the specific rates applied  under Section 10(a).  Presumably, any QF that signed a contract with  Consumers for a facility due to go on line in 1995 would be subject to  payment under the same avoided cost rate schedule, although the way these  rates were manipulated to achieve any particular agreement might vary from  project to project (i.e., in the case of MPLP, the rates are ""backloaded""  over ten years before levelizing for the remaining term of the PPA).  Consumers', which ""self-bills"" under the PPA, began applying ""Year 2""  capacity rates under Exhibit D on January 1, 1996 and implemented subsequent  increases on January 1 of 1997, 1998 and 1999.  January 1 rate increases were  not anticipated by the partnership.  However, there is no definition for  ""contract year"" under the PPA and Exhibit D shows rates by ""Year"" without  specific reference to what constitutes a ""Year"" (i.e., ""contract year"" vs.  ""calendar year"").  Based on Consumers' past actions, it would appear that  their interpretation of the PPA has been that Schedule D sets rates that are  effective in a particular calendar year.  (NOTE FROM A RATE GEEK:  This would  generally jive with the manner in which the avoided cost rates are determined  and scheduled.  That is, it's unlikely that Consumers ran a new avoided cost  study each time it entered into a contract with a QF.  Rather, one could  interpret Column (b) of Exhibit D to lay out the avoided cost rates in effect  in calendar year 1995, 1996, etc.)  Further to this interpretation, Section  10(a) also lays out the manner in which total capacity charges are adjusted  ""if for any calendar year, beginning with the second calendar year after the  calendar year during which the Commercial Operation Date occurs..."" the  project fails to achieve a 60% ""Contract Capacity Factor"" (which is  determined based on results for any calendar year).  Based on Consumers'  action and this language, the partnership remained silent on the  interpretation leading to the rate increase.  As a result of restructuring legislation passed in June 2000, Consumers now  operates under a ""fuel cap""; that is, its Power Service Cost Recovery (PSCR)  rate is frozen.  Accordingly, whereas costs incurred under the PPA were  previously a pass-through (i.e., via Consumers' PSCR and/or base rates),  Consumers now has a strong incentive to minimize purchased power costs as any  savings will, in theory, flow directly to shareholders.    Issue  It should come as no surprise that Consumers' recently concluded that it has  implemented capacity rate increases erroneously.  While no action has been  taken to date, Consumers has indicated in the course of discussing the  reverse tolling transaction for MPLP that it does not intend to implement a  rate increase on January 1, 2001 but will defer the increase until October 1,  2001.  There was no suggestion that Consumers would attempt to reconcile past  capacity rate billing differences (i.e., ""backbilling""), but we need to  assume that they will go after this value as well.    Three side notes on this issue:  To the extent rates were erroneously applied in the past, it would appear  that these costs to Consumers would have been recovered from ratepayers; Mike  Mazowita has indicated that he's seen regulatory filings that would support  this point.  Accordingly, it would appear that Consumers would face some  regulatory issues to the extent it considered ""backbilling""; it's not clear  yet how these would play out in light of the currently effective fuel cap.  We identified this issue during due diligence on MPLP and modeled capacity  charges on a going forward basis in a manner that reflects a contract year  interpretation that has capacity rates running from October 1 to September  30.  Accordingly, we have minimal exposure on value but for the issue of  backbilling, however...  We need to know what rates should be in effect January 1, 2001 in order to  structure a reverse tolling transaction.  It goes without saying, but this is  an untimely issue in the context of reverse tolling discussions with  Consumers.   Legal Questions  Do we have a valid claim that Consumers is required to implement a capacity  rate increase on January 1, 2001?  Does Consumers have a claim to value lost (i.e., backbilling) as a result of  the manner in which rate increases have been previously applied?  To the extent that Consumers does have a claim on backbilling, do we have a  right to recovery from MCN as we were not the owner of the facility during  most of the period of time during which rates may have been applied  erroneously?  Do we have any claims against Dynegy as the MGP of the asset?  That is, did  they have a fiduciary responsibility to (1) pursue/resolve the issue when it  first came up or (2) reserve for future claims by Consumers based on a  different (an potentially correct) interpretation of the contract?  Let me know when you'll be prepared to discuss this and I'll pull together  the right group.

This is a very signifigant issue for  Enron.  Recall that the NYISO intentionally billed for October with the  incorrect prices for the proxy busses even though the prices had been revised  on the NYISO web site for some time prior to the bill.  The impact of this  was that the NYISO withheld about $3,000,000.00 from Enron for October.  In  addition they have not updated the November bill to reflect revised prices  and the payment date is approaching.  When asked about this last month, the  NYISO indicated that they knew they were billing incorrectly and would rebill  later but that, according to the tarriff, market participants must settle  there bills as posted.  I believe this to be a blatent abuse of the tarriff  and that the NYISO is intentionally ""leaning"" on market participants for  credit.  With year end approaching I believe that there is an emphasis on  maximizing working capital which makes this even more critical (this point is  highly confidential).  I believe that if they are not going to address this with the November bill  than we should be taking the most aggressive response.  Should we put this in  an intervention to the NYSEG filing regarding payments  to the NYISO or  should we file separately with FERC requesting as a separate issue?  What  would get the quickest response?  Can and should we consider legal action  outright?  Howard,  can you approach the NYISO at highest levels ASAP with this issue  and find out if there is any intention to address this?  So much for there  efforts to gain credibility in the Marketplace.  Following Howards inquiry, I suggest that we meet by phone to determine our  course of action.  We have very little time if we have any hope of confincing  them of revising the bill with the November billing due around the 15th.  On a similar issue, NYISO is asking us to repay $4.6 million in TCC revenues  from earlier this year.  I believe that they must revise prices in order for  them to do this and that they are outside the window for revising prices.  Howard, can you arrange for Sara Shackleton and Shari Stack to get the TCC  rules that were in effect prior to August as well as any rules around price  revisions.

On the 10th line, does adding the word ""firm"" in front of energy potentially  conflict with the specific transaction if it is something more or something  different than a simple firm deal.  Shouldn't the level of firmness be fully  defined elsewhere in the confirm.  In (b), suggest adding some reference to quantity after your reference to  timing along these lines:  "" (b)  the starting and ending time and date, and  the quantity of the release or interruption;""     Since partial quantity  releases are possible/likely, probably even successive releases (due to  gradual weather changes)  it would be equally as important to identify  quantity and timing.

This shouldn't affect the $/kw-mo bid or offer so  nothing has really changed except for the MW.  In answer to your question on  the turbines.  They were 7B combustion turbines but have been upgraded,  refurbished and all over rebuilt into a GE 7E equivalent.  I have attached  your previous proposal with the new capacity schedules for your review.   Let's revisit our numbers today and see where we stand on the bid/offer  spread.

I previously spoke with Lisa Groff/Frank Hilton, my credit people participating on this subcommittee, and we agreed that it was preferable to have the credit managers and those on this mini-drafting group complete their assignment of crafting a provision for the larger drafting committee of the EEI contract to subsequently review.  The larger drafting committee would review to ensure that the language, phrasing and structure of the document is consistent with the existing EEI contract, and also have the larger group's credit personnel involved in reviewing the subcommittee's work.  As a result, I have not tried to redline at this juncture, because the smaller drafting committee has not finished its work and created a consensus document.  I agree that the timing at year end of this effort is really squeezing our resources.

If so, how are you approaching it? Are you going to come to the meeting with general comments or are you going to circulate a redline in advance? Will your credit people be on the line too?

I will be here  till Friday and then back again on Sunday night until the end of the week.

Shares of Edison International (NYSE:EIX - news), the parent = of Southern California Edison, closed at $17-7/8, down $1-1/8, or 5.92 = percent.  The utilities operate under a rate freeze through March 2002, and are also = unable to negotiate long-term supply contracts. These factors expose them = to the vagaries of the volatile spot power market.  Wholesale power recently cost more than $1,400 per megawatt hour, a more = than 40-fold increase over the $35 per megawatt hour rate last year.  California imposed the rate freeze as part of its deregulation of the = utilities sector, which was intended to promote competition and consumer = choice.  Among the options the commission has to remedy the situation are a hike in = the utilities' price caps.  Even that, however, would constitute a ``band-aid on a bullet wound,'' = said Ron Barone, who leads S&P's utility group and also participated in = the conference call.  Californians have already been warned to cut back their energy use, and = that they may be subject to rolling blackouts.  Cortright said unless the commission offers the utilities significant = regulatory relief, Pacific G&E and Southern California Edison will be = dependent on the capital markets for cash infusions, if any are available.  ``There are bills that are coming due in January and February,'' he said. = ``We would be naive to think that the capital markets are going to open = their doors to satisfy (their needs) in the current environment.''  ``To be frank,'' he added, ``we are amazed that events have been permitted = to reach anywhere near this critical stage. It truly is unfathomable. We = really do need some emergency actions taken now.''  Pacific G&E last completed a big bond sale in October, selling $1.35 = billion of bonds. Southern California Edison and its parent, Edison = International, sold an equivalent amount in early November.  Both companies carry ``A-plus'' corporate credit ratings and ``single-A'' = senior unsecured debt ratings. Pacific G&E's secured debt carries an = ``AA-minus'' rating. Those ratings are considered mid to high investment = grades.  One trader said Southern California Edison's debt began on Tuesday being = quoted by price, like junk bonds, instead of by the extra yield they offer = relative to similar maturity U.S. Treasuries, like investment-grade bonds.  Its 5.875 percent notes maturing in September 2004 were quoted Wednesday = at about 87 cents on the dollar, yielding about 11.3 percent to maturity. = No price quotation was immediately available on Pacific G&E's debt.=20   ",mark.haedicke@enron.com,elizabeth.sager@enron.com,FYI: PGE default warnings issued,2000-12-20 10:13:00-08:00,sent

Let me summarize below:  (1) Avista Energy's original confirmation number 404335 showed Total Volume of 982,400 MWh's.  PG&E revised the Total Volume to 981,600 MWh.  Avista did not respond with an affirmation of the corrected volume.  Our records show that the original volume of 982,400 is correct (there was a leap-year day in year 2000).  The broker confirm and the PG&E revision seem to be both in error.  Obviously any new confirm that is written between Avista Energy and Enron will have the proper Total Volume for the remaining MWh's.  Since this Assignment references the original confirmation, our counsel recommends language to be inserted under Exhibit B as stated below (see email from Blair Strong below).  Will this sort of revision be acceptable to PG&E and Enron? Please advise.  (2) Avista Energy's original confirmation number 403862 showed a Total Volume of 14,400.  PG&E accepted the confirm ""as is.""  The broker confirmation shows total volume correctly as 876,000 MWh's.  Therefore, both PG&E and AVISTA screwed up.  HOwever, we acknowledge that the total MWh's should correctly be as per the broker confirmation.  Again, our counsel recommends language to be inserted under Exhibit B as stated below (see email from Blair Strong below).  Will this sort of revision be acceptable to PG&E and Enron?  Please advise.   To reiterate, we realize that there will be new confirmations between Enron and Avista.  Enron has traditionally written the confirmations (Enron's confirm's prevail).  Therefore, the new confirms should be acceptable.  We would like to see those confirms in advance if possible.  Lastly, time is of the essense.  We are scheduling power already for January deliveries....therefore, we must act quickly on this assignment so as to prevent any problems with scheduling, etc.  I suppose that we could delay the start dates to February 1st, 2001 if necessary.

Let me summarize below:  (1) Avista Energy's original confirmation number 404335 showed Total Volume of 982,400 MWh's.  PG&E revised the Total Volume to 981,600 MWh.  Avista did not respond with an affirmation of the corrected volume.  Our records show that the original volume of 982,400 is correct (there was a leap-year day in year 2000).  The broker confirm and the PG&E revision seem to be both in error.  Obviously any new confirm that is written between Avista Energy and Enron will have the proper Total Volume for the remaining MWh's.  Since this Assignment references the original confirmation, our counsel recommends language to be inserted under Exhibit B as stated below (see email from Blair Strong below).  Will this sort of revision be acceptable to PG&E and Enron? Please advise.  (2) Avista Energy's original confirmation number 403862 showed a Total Volume of 14,400.  PG&E accepted the confirm ""as is.""  The broker confirmation shows total volume correctly as 876,000 MWh's.  Therefore, both PG&E and AVISTA screwed up.  HOwever, we acknowledge that the total MWh's should correctly be as per the broker confirmation.  Again, our counsel recommends language to be inserted under Exhibit B as stated below (see email from Blair Strong below).  Will this sort of revision be acceptable to PG&E and Enron?  Please advise.   To reiterate, we realize that there will be new confirmations between Enron and Avista.  Enron has traditionally written the confirmations (Enron's confirm's prevail).  Therefore, the new confirms should be acceptable.  We would like to see those confirms in advance if possible.  Lastly, time is of the essense.  We are scheduling power already for January deliveries....therefore, we must act quickly on this assignment so as to prevent any problems with scheduling, etc.  I suppose that we could delay the start dates to February 1st, 2001 if necessary.  Perhaps not a big issue.  Thanks, Nolan Steiner Ph: 509-495-8199    -----Original Message----- From: R.

Please read  the attached and confirm that this is your understanding of the  PGET/EPMI/  EEMC assignment.    I am also at this time forwarding to the working group my four main points,  which I think reflect my main areas of concern under the drafts:  1.  I would like to say  that  the price is the same under the transactions.   Transaction costs should be dealt with separately.  2. While we have agreed to take a pass through of the bankruptcy risk,  this  draft provides that we take on all contract dispute risk.  As I understand  it, EPMI intends to pass through all risk, such as change in delivery point  risk, under the contract.  Since EPMI is our sole provider of power to EES  (other than  the PGET contract), EPMI is in the best position to manage   general contract risk with its counterparties, as it does today with all our  physical electricity purchases.  EPMI may  have disputes under contracts for  many reasons that EEMC is not aware of and will not be in a position to  influence once the contracts are  assigned to Avista. 3. I assume if EPMI  trades out of  these positions as it manages its own  portfolio, the credit risk would not follow to subsequent counterparties and  the EPMI/EES confirm terms would revert to typical confirm language. 4.  I was operating under the assumption that the tax issue would be resolved  with Steve Douglass prior to signing the main documents.  I am not sure  whether this issue can be quantified by EES tax today.  Any suggestions or  ability to resolve/quantify today?  Same concern for the accounting issues.   My concern here is that if the transaction leaves us in a worse economic  position as a result of making EPMI whole, this would need to be addressed  with our business people.

Termination Rights Based on the Failure to Post Collateral  It is possible that we could terminate the following contracts based on PGE's  or one of its subsidiaries's failure to post collateral as required by the  underlying contracts"":  1.  PG&E/ENA - Financial ISDA  - Enron exposure $23 million  2.  PGET Power/EPMI - Physical power - Enron exposure $215 million  3. PGE Canada/Enron Canada - Physical gas - Enron exposure $15 million  4.PGE Canada/ENA - Physical gas - Enron exposure $1 million   II. Termination Rights Based on PG&E's Failure to Pay Indebtedness  It is possible that we could terminate the following contracts based on  PG&E's or one of its subsidiaries's default on indebtedness in excess of a  threshold (either $100 million or $50 million):  1. PG&E/ENA - Financial ISDA - Enron Exposure $23 million  2. PG&E/EPMI Physical Power -Enron exposure ($90 million)  3.PGET Power/ENA - Physical Coal - Enron exposure $200,000  4.PGET Power/ENA - Financial GTC - Enron exposure ($6.2 million)  5.PGET Power/EPMI - Physical power - Enron exposure (out of the money,  currently used to net other EEMC power master which is net in the money $215  million - see contract 2 above)  6.PGE Canada/Enron Canada - Physical gas - Enron exposure $15 million  7.

PGET Gas/ENA - Physical gas - Enron exposure ($25 million)  11. PGET Gas/EES - Physical gas - Enron exposure ($700,000)  Most of the above agreements are supported by a guaranty from PG&E's parent  (PG&E Corporation) in the amount of $475,000,000.  We have not yet made  demand on the parent but could do so after PGE or its other unregulated  subsidiaries failed to pay amounts due.    Exposures are approximate as of 1/19/01.  Before terminating, we would need  to verify actual contract language.  B.  SCE Default  SCE is in default of a contract between SCE and EPMI relating to  a power  sales position which is out of the money to EPMI approximately ($35 million)  based upon SCE's failure to make payments on debt in excess of $100 million.

"Elizabeth, I'm going to forward to you and Richard a few emails recently circulated by the joint defense group in which an overview of the Trust's damage argument is outlined and ideas exchanged about it.  Knowing you're buried with other matters, if there is any chance you could review them/print them out & review and give me a call so that we can discuss, I'd greatly appreciate it.    The description of what the defense group is anticipating appears to be consistent with what the Trust told us in one of our early conference calls about how it was calculating damages in our case.  I'd like to know if you agree or if there are difference in what our Master Agreement/confirmation letters damage provisions provide.  I would also like to review the counterarguments that we've articulated in brief before.  If you'd like to schedule a set time to talk over the next few days, that's great; let me know what works for you.  Feel free to call me at any time and we can discuss.

While I maintain that the argument leads to an absurd result (namely that PCA could repudiate/breach the contracts and still collect damages), it may be that we need an expert to analyze the LD provisions of the contracts to aid us in our response.  It would be interesting to know what our clients' think about this argument or what Scott Jones thinks of it.  For example, can PCA claim that sellers who appropriatedly demanded adequate assurance ""failed"" to schedule or deliver power when they proposed to continue to schedule/deliver once adequate assurance was posted.  Similarly, would a trading expert interpret the LD provision relating to having a seller's performance ""excused"" by PCA to be limited to situations where PCA and the seller were ""booking out"" or PCA was otherwise making affirmative statements to the seller that delivery was not expected?

Dear Counsel:  I think Tim is correct when he lays out the Trust's damage theory.   While we should anticipate it and have a response in our brief, I suggest there are a number of flaws.  1.   The damage language for Seller non-delivery expressly provides that no damages are allowed where the non-delivery was ""caused"" by the buyer. ""Cause"" is an undefined term as far as I can see.   We will, of course, argue that cause necessarily includes PCA's prospective inability to perform and its actual business failure.  If ""cause"" were limited to situations where the buyer affirmatively refuses to take the power, then a dying marketer could  make millions simply by keeping its mouth shut.   2.   The logical extension of the Trust's argument (that you have to run through the two step damage analysis regardless of the reasons for one party's failure to perform) is that, as noted above, a shaky marketer could time its failure in a rising market and thus assert millions in damage claims by never telling counterparties it would not accept delivery of power.   3.   The Trust's argument presupposes that we had no legal right to demand adequate assurance and take steps to protect ourselves.  The reference to the ""exclusive"" nature of the damage remedy has nothing to do with our right to demand adequate assurance.  Rather, that remedy provision expresses the ""exclusive"" means for calculating the amount of damages in the event the seller breaches, and does not address the question of whether, in fact, the seller actually breached the contract.

The language of the liquidated damages provision (LD Provision), which I have simplified, is as follows:  ""Damages for Non-Performance  (1) For this firm transaction, if the Buyer fails to schedule and/or to receive the Quantity, where such failure was not excused . . . by Seller, Buyer shall pay Seller (on the date payment would otherwise be due under this transaction) an amount for each MWh of such deficiency equaling the sum of: (i) [the contract price] minus (ii) [the market price]; provided however, if the amount determined in the preceding clause is negative, then the amount shall be equal to zero for purposes of calculating the deficiency payment.  (2) For this firm transaction, if the Seller fails to schedule and/or to deliver the Quantity, where such failure was not excused . . . by Buyer, Seller shall pay Buyer (on the date payment would otherwise be due under this transaction) an amount for each MWh of such deficiency equaling the sum of: (i) [the market price] minus (ii) [the contract price]; provided however, if the amount determined in the preceding clause is negative, then the amount shall be equal to zero for purposes of calculating the deficiency payment.  (3) [acknowledgement that these provisions are for liquidated damages and not a penalty]  (4) [exclusive remedy provision]""  To illustrate how I think that the Trust interprets this LD Provision, lets assume that PGET had a contract to sell power to PCA for delivery at Cinergy during July-August 1998 at a price of $50/MWH (""the Transaction"").  Let's assume that, based on PCA's payment or delivery defaults, PGET terminates the Transaction and all other forward transactions with PCA in late June 1998.  Let's assume further that the market price for power at Cinergy was $100/MWH on the date of termination (without getting into whether you look to index price of forward price).  The Trust will argue that PCA failed to schedule and/or receive power from PGET under the Transaction, and therefore PCA must make ""the deficiency payment"" to PGET under clause (1).  Under clause (1), however, this deficiency payment would be zero.  The Trust will argue further that PGET also failed to schedule and/or deliver power to PCA under the Transaction, and therefore PGET must make ""the deficiency payment"" to PCA under clause (2).  Under clause (2), PGET would have to make a deficiency payment of $50 times the Quantity.  The Trust will argue further that, under the express contractual language of the LD Provision, it doesn't matter whether PCA was able to actually perform under the Transaction.  The parties' intent in entering into an agreement containing the LD Provision was to require each party to pay ""the deficiency amount"" in the event that the Transaction is not performed.  The only situation where a party would NOT have to pay ""the deficiency amount"" is (a) in the event of force majeure, or (b) when the other party excuses performance.  PCA will argue that, regardless of whether it was in default or unable to perform, it did not excuse performance by PGET under the Transaction.  The Trust will argue that this is the parties' express contract and sole remedy in the event of non-performance.  Therefore, the Trust will argue, it does not matter whether PCA was able to perform the contracts.  If a contract was not performed, then the damages are calculated under the LD Provision.  The Trust will also argue that it does not matter whether PGET had a RIGHT to terminate the Transaction because of PCA's default.  It only matters that the contract was not performed.  Moreover, I am confident that this interpretation of the LD provision is the basis for the ""positive difference"" damages calculation that Peter keeps referring to.  With regard to damages, I imagine that the Trust will argue that:  (A) Under direct book-outs, performance is excused; therefore, you net the contract price of the two contracts.  (B) Under all other transactions, you look solely at whether power was scheduled and/or delivered.  If not, then you calculate each party's liquidated damages, with respect to each and every transaction, under clauses (1) and (2) of the LD Provision.  The advantage this line of argument is obvious:  (1)  It is based on the express language of the confirmation statement that the Trust will contend was part of the contract;  (2)  It is a simple response to the inability to perform argument; and  (3)  It actually makes sense in the context of a commodities market.  This is what we are going to hear from the Trust in their mediation submission.

The language of the liquidated damages provision (LD Provision), which I have simplified, is as follows:  ""Damages for Non-Performance  (1) For this firm transaction, if the Buyer fails to schedule and/or to receive the Quantity, where such failure was not excused . . . by Seller, Buyer shall pay Seller (on the date payment would otherwise be due under this transaction) an amount for each MWh of such deficiency equaling the sum of: (i) [the contract price] minus (ii) [the market price]; provided however, if the amount determined in the preceding clause is negative, then the amount shall be equal to zero for purposes of calculating the deficiency payment.  (2) For this firm transaction, if the Seller fails to schedule and/or to deliver the Quantity, where such failure was not excused . . . by Buyer, Seller shall pay Buyer (on the date payment would otherwise be due under this transaction) an amount for each MWh of such deficiency equaling the sum of: (i) [the market price] minus (ii) [the contract price]; provided however, if the amount determined in the preceding clause is negative, then the amount shall be equal to zero for purposes of calculating the deficiency payment.  (3) [acknowledgement that these provisions are for liquidated damages and not a penalty]  (4) [exclusive remedy provision]""  To illustrate how I think that the Trust interprets this LD Provision, lets assume that PGET had a contract to sell power to PCA for delivery at Cinergy during July-August 1998 at a price of $50/MWH (""the Transaction"").? Let's assume that, based on PCA's payment or delivery defaults, PGET terminates the Transaction and all other forward transactions with PCA in late June 1998.? Let's assume further that the market price for power at Cinergy was $100/MWH on the date of termination (without getting into whether you look to index price of forward price).  The Trust will argue that PCA failed to schedule and/or receive power from PGET under the Transaction, and therefore PCA must make ""the deficiency payment"" to PGET under clause (1).? Under clause (1), however, this deficiency payment would be zero.  The Trust will argue further that PGET also failed to schedule and/or deliver power to PCA under the Transaction, and therefore PGET must make ""the deficiency payment"" to PCA under clause (2).? Under clause (2), PGET would have to make a deficiency payment of $50 times the Quantity.  The Trust will argue further that, under the express contractual language of the LD Provision, it doesn't matter whether PCA was able to actually perform under the Transaction.? The parties' intent in entering into an agreement containing the LD Provision was to require each party to pay ""the deficiency amount"" in the event that the Transaction is not performed.? The only situation where a party would NOT have to pay ""the deficiency amount"" is (a) in the event of force majeure, or (b) when the other party excuses performance.? PCA will argue that, regardless of whether it was in default or unable to perform, it did not excuse performance by PGET under the Transaction.  The Trust will argue that this is the parties' express contract and sole remedy in the event of non-performance.? Therefore, the Trust will argue, it does not matter whether PCA was able to perform the contracts.? If a contract was not performed, then the damages are calculated under the LD Provision.  The Trust will also argue that it does not matter whether PGET had a RIGHT to terminate the Transaction because of PCA's default.? It only matters that the contract was not performed.  Moreover, I am confident that this interpretation of the LD provision is the basis for the ""positive difference"" damages calculation that Peter keeps referring to.? With regard to damages, I imagine that the Trust will argue that:  (A) Under direct book-outs, performance is excused; therefore, you net the contract price of the two contracts.  (B) Under all other transactions, you look solely at whether power was scheduled and/or delivered.? If not, then you calculate each party's liquidated damages, with respect to each and every transaction, under clauses (1) and (2) of the LD Provision.  The advantage this line of argument is obvious:  (1)? It is based on the express language of the confirmation statement that the Trust will contend was part of the contract;  (2)? It is a simple response to the inability to perform argument; and  (3)? It actually makes sense in the context of a commodities market.  This is what we are going to hear from the Trust in their mediation submission.

I sat down with John Lavorato and Dana Davis  this morning to review the deal and get John's approval under the current  terms. He has approved the deal in it's current form however, to the extent  that we have any material change in the terms I'll need to be sure he's OK  with the changes in advance of any binding committment with Central Maine.  This is definitely a deal we want to do and given the anticipated  acceleration in the negotiations and possible execution, we need to be sure  that we're able to react and transact quickly. Dana Davis is obviously on  point for all pricing. For all others who have involvement here - please  ensure that you're on board with your piece of the deal as is, and available  to focus on any negotiated changes that may come up over the next couple of  days. Berney Aucoin will be on point for coordinating and managing all  internal pricing, approvals, etc., so be sure that Bernie can get ahold of  you if he needs to.    Also, for the DASH signatures, why don't you move both Kevin and I to  ""Regional Management"" and let Ader and Davis sign for Origination and  Trading.

We are  currently in the process of negotiating a contract and transaction terms.   They are simultaneously discussing same with other suppliers.  At this point,  there are a number of outstanding items (including numerous contract items  and credit arrangements).  However, we expect that the pace of the  negotiation process will be very quick over the next 1-3 days.   As an  example of how quickly things might move, CMP has indicated that the Maine  PUC is poised to hold deliberations and approve CMP's signing of a contract  within 24 hours of CMP/Enron agreement on contract terms (with updated firm  pricing to be supplied just prior to PUC deliberations and held open for  about 2-3 hours).  Key members of our negotiating team on this deal are as follows:  Origination/Marketing:  John Llodra, George Wood Legal:  Janice Moore Regulatory/Governmental:  Daniel Allegretti Commodity Structuring:  Jim Meyn, Zach Sampson Credit:  Edward Sacks, Tracy Ngo  Attached below is a draft of the DASH for this prospective deal.  Items  subject to change or still under negotiation are noted.   While this DASH is  prepared assuming we obtain a multi-year extension swaption, there is a  chance it may end up being a single year deal for the period Mar 1, 01- Feb  28, 02.   My intent in sending the DASH at this time is to familiarize you  all with the aspects of the deal at this point in time, to enable us to move  quickly to get internal approvals in the event we reach final agreement with  CMP over the next couple of days.  Once agreement is reached with CMP on  outstanding items, a revised DASH will be circulated.  Please feel free to  call me at 978-449-9936, or Jim Meyn/Berney Aucoin in structuring (5-3223,  3-4784) if you have any questions on the commercial structure or valuation to  date.  Thanks.

Under the provisions of AB 1X, which the PUC apparently had confidence would be enacted without significant change, the PUC requires the DWR to sell the power it purchases directly to the retail end use customers of Southern California Edison (SCE) and Pacific Gas & Electric (PG&E). Since the law requires the PUC to ensure that DWR recovers all of the costs of its power purchase program and yet also limits the recovery to only an allocable portion of the utilities* currently frozen energy charges, the PUC recognizes the possibility that DWR*s costs may not be fully recovered at certain times.  The PUC makes SCE and PG&E liable to pay any shortfalls to ensure DWR recovers its costs on as current a basis as possible, but suggests it is open to further consideration of this policy. URG Assets Re-Regulated The PUC orders the three utilities to each make *Advice Letter* filings to establish cost-based rates for their URG.  The rate set will be made retroactive to whenever the utility stopped bidding its retained generation into to the PX, which SCE and PG&E said they stopped doing on 12/28/00.  The two utilities said they stopped participating in the PX day-of and day-ahead markets on 01/19/01. The PUC directs the utilities to calculate their cost of capital-related revenue requirements using the amounts in their respective Transition Cost Balancing Accounts (TCBA) as the rate base.  The TCBA reflects the net book value of utility generation assets less the recovery of those assets* stranded costs.  The PUC will allow utilities to record in a memorandum account the difference between this reduced rate of return component of revenue requirements and their last PUC authorized rate of return for the same assets, for possible future use in adjusting the TCBA-based rates.  The amounts in these memorandum accounts will represent the difference between their current allowed returns and what they *may have earned had these generation costs been recovered under traditional cost of service ratemaking in place prior to restructuring.*  The cost-based rates so determined, the PUC says, would comply with the principle that ratepayers pay just and reasonable rates, and as costs change would be subject to adjustment. The PUC decides that SCE, PG&E, and San Diego Gas & Electric (SDG&E) should use their *utility retained generation* (URG) in the following order, to: 1) serve their existing customers at cost-of-service based rates; 2) sell power at cost-based rates to other California investor-owned utilities; and 3) sell or barter excess power from URG to minimize future costs.  The PUC directs that if any surplus generation exists, it should first be offered to other California IOUs at cost-based rates, with any net proceeds to benefit in-state ratepayers.  URG consists of utility-owned generation and long-term purchased power contracts. Since the December 15, 2000 order from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) ending the investor-owned utilities* obligation to sell all of their energy produced through the Power Exchange (PX) and buy all of their energy requirements from the PX (the so-called *buy/sell requirement*), utilities had no regulatory direction for using and pricing their retained generation.  In lieu of an evidentiary hearing, because of the need to protect the public interest during this time of nearly continuous Stage 3 supply emergencies, the PUC now provides this direction. The PUC makes SDG&E a party to the URG aspects of its order, while the PUC does not apply the DWR delivery and pricing rules to SDG&E, at this time. The AB 1X law does not exclude SDG&E*s retail customers from receiving DWR power, but the PUC opts not to require DWR power to go them at this time.  In this interim order adopted on 01/31/01, the PUC says it does not end the rate freeze, set an interim valuation, or otherwise provide a basis for ending the rate freeze.  As far as it addresses the pricing and use of utilities* retained generation, the order only sets an interim basis for pricing the power utilities continue to produce and provide to their customers since the effectively defunct PX no longer fulfills this function.  Residual Pricing of DWR Power Because of the provisions of AB 1X, which was enacted the day after the PUC adopted its order, the PUC must price DWR power residually, or as a percentage of what each SCE and PG&E retail end use customer currently pays them for energy.  The utilities* energy charges are currently frozen at different levels for each utility and each customer class.  The percentage is calculated by dividing (1) the amount of power provided by DWR and delivered by the utility, by (2) the total amount of power generated or purchased by the utility and the amount of power in item (1).  The amount of power purchased by the utility includes purchases from QFs and others for resale, as well as any energy they purchase in the ISO*s real time market. This percentage or ratio will be calculated daily. The PUC provides the following example, if a utility generates and purchases 750 MWh of power and delivers along with it 250 MWh of DWR power for a total of 1,000 MWh, each customer owes DWR 25% of the energy charge in their rates for the power they used that day. Utilities will collect these amounts from customers on behalf of DWR and hold the amounts in trust for DWR. As the law requires the calculation of the amounts to be collected on the basis of the megawatt hours DWR actually purchases and delivers, while calculating the amounts it is entitled to recover from utilities* retail customers in dollars of costs, there is a built in potential for DWR*s costs to be under recovered, depending on how the actual price DWR pays for each MWh matches up with the utilities* existing, frozen energy charges. The PUC says that making the utilities liable for any shortfall in the recovery of DWR*s costs *satisfies the legislative concern that the State recover the funds expended.*  If the two cash-strapped, nearly bankrupt utilities are liable for substantial amounts to make DWR whole, these amounts would likely only add to the approximately $12 billion in unpaid, overdue purchased power costs they have already accumulated. Following the provisions of AB 1X, the PUC sets the DWR price of power upon resale as equal to DWR*s purchased power costs, plus administrative costs, transmission and scheduling costs, and other related costs, less any overpayments DWR may subsequently recover from suppliers. Again following the provisions of AB 1X, the PUC directs DWR to retain title to its power until sold to the utilities* retail end use customers, and reminds that under the new statute *neither the full faith and credit nor the taxing power of the State of California may be pledged for the payment for any obligation.*  The PUC orders the two cash-strapped utilities to deliver DWR power to retail customers and directs the utilities to take no ownership or other interest in DWR power, acting only in an administrative capacity as billing agents for DWR.

While I think we  should walk through the various contractual provisions over the phone, I  nonetheless thought it might be of some help to set forth a few preliminary  focal points for those discussions, particularly if you don't get to this for  a few days.  I thought it made sense to contemporaneously record some  comments as I was thinking through some of the issues/positions.  Also, I'll  have to run down the conflict issue when I get back into the office, but I  thought I could generally review the PPA in any event.  In addition, I did not know whether it was ENA's or Dynegy's obligation to  work on a response to CMS, but I thought it made some sense to see what one  might look like on paper.  (See  attached).  At this point, however, I'm not  sure whether MPLP should furnish any specific contract-based rationale in  writing to CMS as to MPLP's position that the capacity charges should be  adjusted on a calendar year basis.  You will note that the draft letter  focuses on the language dealing with the adjustment formula to the Contract  Capacity Factor (which clearly is done on a calendar year basis), rather than  the scheduled changes to the stated capacity charges set forth on Exhibit D.   As noted below, there are some issues underlying this position.  Preliminary Overall Assessment  The PPA essentially is inconsistent on the capacity charge adjustment issue.   While many of the relevant computations are done on a calendar year  basis--which generally supports MPLP's position--the effect of adjusting the  stated capacity charges on a calendar year basis results in two anomalies:  namely, the stated capacity charge (on Exhibit D) for ""Year 1"" only would  apply for 3 months, but even more importantly, the capacity charge (on  Exhibit D) for ""Year 35"" would apply for the last 21 months of the Contract  Term.  The anomaly ""running in the other direction"" is that, under CMS's  interpretation, various computations would be made on a calendar year basis  (e.g., Contract Capacity Factor), and adjustments resulting therefrom would  be applied ""mid-stream"" (i.e., after 3 months of the alleged ""contract year""  ).  My overall concern is that an arbitrator may focus on the anomaly  (described above) that results by applying Exhibit D using a calendar year  concept (i.e., the 21 month ""Year 35"" issue) since that is a fairly easy  concept to get your arms around..  More Information/Diligence/Research  Before a definitive conclusion on the issue can be made, we likely would want  to review or undertake, as the case may be, some additional  information/diligence/research, such as (which I assume we could generally  obtain from the Michigan regulatory counsel referenced in the e-mail you  forwarded):  --The Michigan PUC presumably approved the PPA (prior to the first amendment)  in a published Order.  Was there anything in that Order or the submissions  (or exhibits thereto, including financial projections) that might provide  some guidance?  --My guess is that there must be other CMS QF PPAs with the same type of  pricing structure since this issue essentially would arise in every instance  where the COD was not a Jan.1.  Do we (or local counsel) know whether this  may be a ""global"" attack by CMS on these types of PPAs?  --While not directly relevant to the contract interpretation question,  confirm with local counsel that CMS would have recovered the ""excess""  capacity payments from its customers--so that it presumably would have to  issue a customer refund if it were to prevail on its claims.  --CMS ""self bills"" itself under the PPA.  Has the statute of limitations run  on any of its claims for refunds for prior years?  Can CMS's prior course of  dealing be used to support MPLP's contractual interpretation, or is there  otherwise an equitable argument that CMS should not be able to recover prior  ""overpayments"" (as opposed to prospectively adjusting the capacity  payments)?  (This could be particularly helpful to try to settle out the  dispute on the basis that MPLP would concede the issue on a prospective basis  only).  --The cover letter from CMS suggests that the alleged payment error resulted  in payments in excess of the avoided cost rate authorized by the PUC.  Isn't  this determination to be made over the life of the PPA, rather than for any  particular period?  Assuming CMS's statement is correct, I assume it does not  affect the validity of the PPA, but only whether CMS can recover the ""excess""  amount in rates?  --Do we have any leverage in the event we were to raise this dispute with the  PUC?  If so, can this be used in the context of trying to work out an overall  restructuring of the PPA?   Certain Points in Support of MPLP's Position  --The definition of ""Contract Capacity Factor"" provides for a calendar year  determination and, most importantly, provides for a partial year calculation  for the year in which the COD occurs that ends at the end of that calendar  year.  If the capacity charge should be adjusted as of the anniversary of the  COD date, it arguably would not make sense to have a partial year calculation.  --Sec. 10(a) provides that if in any calendar year the Contract Capacity  Factor is less than 60%, then the capacity charges set forth on Exhibit D  ""shall be adjusted for the next calendar year as follows.... The capacity  charges for the following calendar year shall then be determined....   (Emphasis added).  This section makes specific reference to Exhibit D and  makes the adjustment effective for the next calendar year, not on the next  anniversary of the COD.  It arguably would not appear to make any sense to  apply the Contract Capacity Factor adjustment on a calendar basis, but  determine the capacity charges on a COD anniversary basis if no adjustments  thereto are required because the Contract Capacity Factor levels do not  require an adjustment.   --NOTE:  The counter-argument, however, is that the foregoing language only  pertains to the computation of a percentage ""haircut"" or adjustment that is  applied to the stated capacity charges on Exhibit D, whatever those may be,  rather than to when the annual stated capacity charges are effective.  That  is, making this adjustment on a calendar year basis, even though the  scheduled capacity rates change each October 1, is not necessarily in  conflict with the rest of the PPA.  --Sec. 2(b) (Effective Date and Term) provides that the Agreement runs for 35  years ""and thereafter from year to year,"" unless a party gives at least one  year's notice to terminate which termination shall be effective ""at the end  of the 35 years or any calendar year thereafter."" (Emphasis added).  Thus,  for example, if one month after the end of the 35 year term--i.e., October  31, 2030--a party gave notice to terminate, such termination would be  effective December 31, 2031, not September 30, 2031 or September 30, 2032  (i.e., not on the anniversary dates of the COD).  Thus, the PPA contemplates  in certain respects certain ""stub"" years and certain ""long"" years, a  contractual scheme that is at least analogous to MPLP's position on the stub  and long years for the timing of the scheduled changes in the stated capacity  charges on Exhibit D.  --There are other calendar year based obligations--for e.g., Sec. 13 (and  Exhibit B) reflect termination payments that, again, are calculated on a  calendar year basis.  (We should discuss with the commercial people the  economic rationale underlying the termination payments to see if there may be  additional support in that respect).  (Note that some other calendar year  based calculations were eliminated by the First Amendment to the PPA, but can  still be used to reflect the underlying ""calendar year"" flavor of the PPA  since the issue at hand existed even prior to the First Amendment).  A Few Additional Points to Note  --The PPA is devoid of default language, LDs, etc.; however, MPLP could bring  a claim against CMS to arbitration (Sec. 18) for what it believes it is owed  when CMS does not pay the full capacity charges in 2001 (plus interest as  provided at Sec. 20) and keep performing under the PPA.  --Although I do not see a significant issue here, let's briefly discuss the  potential for CMS to try to affirmatively use an ""indication"" of a regulatory  disallowance pursuant to Sec. 10(c) as a way to attempt to force its  ""contract year"" interpretation of Exhibit D.  While Sec. 10(c) is one of  those ""old school"" one way regulatory outs, MPLP would undoubtedly use Sec.  10(e) [requiring CMS to defend the PPA) to prevent CMS's affirmatively use of  the PUC to support its contract claim.  (In Pennsylvania, PECO, in an  analogous circumstance, attempted to use a PUC determination as justification  to attempt to break a PPA with a QF).  Let me know when you wish to follow up.

My general thoughts are as follows:  1.  Significance of Parties' Business and Economic Arrangements.  As you  know, the precise nature of the business and economic relationship between  ECT and Counterparty likely will affect the legal analysis; thus, it will be  necessary to keep a close on that issue as the negotiations proceed.  It  would appear that ECT generally would press for an agency relationship since  the law is somewhat more favorable with respect to the ability to carve out  areas where the agent does not owe a fiduciary duty to its principal.   However, depending on the business and economic negotiations, there may  ultimately be some risk that ECT could be deemed to be in a ""partner"" role  vis-a-vis the Counterparty.  We assume, for example, that ECT would possess  the power to bind the Counterparty to power sales contracts with third  parties (subject, most likely, to specified parameters), at least with  respect to spot market type deals.  (This likely will be the case even if the  Counterparty has the right to terminate the agreement at anytime -- which  termination effectively would be prospective in nature since any existing  deals would continue to binding on Counterparty).  The risk of deemed partner  status probably will exist regardless of whether the governing agreement  specifically provides that the arrangement is not intended to create a  partnership.  A further indicia of partner status would be if ECT's compensation is tied to  net profits, particularly if ECT also shared in losses to some extent (e.g.,  perhaps in the nature of an overall ""netting"" or ""tracking"" account pursuant  to which, for example, profits previously paid out to ECT would be recaptured  with future losses (but never go below zero)).  Another factor running in  favor of partner status will be the length of the agreement; a longer  agreement often suggests more of a partnership arrangement.  2.    The Choice of Governing Law may be Significant.  For example, in states  that have adopted the Uniform Partnership Act (""UPA"") (e.g., New York,  Delaware, Pennsylvania), there is more of a concern that a court would impose  a higher fiduciary duty standard on ECT.  This result is less likely in  states that have adopted the Revised Uniform Partnership Act (""RUPA"") (20  states, including Texas, California and Montana), pursuant to which the  parties can exclude specific categories of activities that are not subject to  the partner's fiduciary duty obligation (if the carve outs are not manifestly  unreasonable).  Although ECT presumably will always take the position that it  is not a partner of Counterparty, in analyzing these issues, ECT should try  to apply those tougher standards to its relationship in the event a court  ever determined that those standards should apply.  The bottom line may be  that the definitive agreements will need to specifically state that the  parties recognize that ECT is in the business of buying and selling power and  that it will be in competition with Counterparty, ECT is not obligated to  bring Counterparty the best deals, Counterparty can terminate if it is  dissatisfied, etc.  It will be advisable to list specific activities where it  is clear ECT and Counterparty may be in competition, rather than rely on a  general waiver of fiduciary duties; the courts clearly do not like advance  disclaimers of all fiduciary duties (particularly where, like here, the  arrangement is likely to be an exclusive one). Where ECT will need to be  particularly careful will be with respect to ensuring against the use of  confidential information from the Counterparty and its facilities in its  stand alone power trading operations.  3.  Other Considerations.  One additional consideration to keep in mind.  The  potential Counterparty you mentioned on the phone intends to project finance,  on a nonrecourse or limited recourse basis, many of the plants it proposes to  acquire.  Like any merchant plant financing arrangement that is being put in  place in today's ""deregulating"" power markets, the project lender will be  very involved in any arrangement dealing with the marketing of the power from  those plants since, obviously, that is the source of repayment for their  loan.  The lender(s) could drive, for example, such items as the governing  law for the definitive agreements, the term of the agreement, etc.  In  addition, the lender will be very interested in any economic arrangement that  could result in ""performance"" or similar types of bonuses being payable by  the Counterparty to the agent, as well as any ""clawback"" of previously paid  amounts in the event of subsequently incurred negative results.  In one  similar arrangement with which have been involved, the lender has been very  active in the negotiations of a similar type of agreement.  My guess is that  undoubtedly will be the case in the situation you raised.  Thus, ECT's  commercial negotiators likely will be encountering multiple parties ""on the  other side.""  4.  PECO/Great Bay Dispute.  I put on the fax to you again another copy of  the previous summary I had put together on the PECO/Great Bay contract  dispute for your quick reference.  As we discussed, there are a number of  provisions in that contract that ECT's originators would find of interest  from a commercial perspective  -- with the clear caveat that some of them  obviously are what lead to the litigation.  The allegations in the complaint  clearly are, to some extent, of the fiduciary duty type (implied covenant of  good faith and fair dealing).  Interestingly, there is a lack of language in  that agreement trying to carve out PECO's obligations to Great Bay with  respect to PECO's own trading operations.  I hope the foregoing is at least somewhat useful to you, although the ""rules""  in this area are fairly blurry.  Please call me if you have any questions.

We should  be able to get back to you this week with our thoughts in that respect and we  will forward to you the major authorities, articles, etc.  that we come up  with.  My sense of the market is that it is likely that ECT may be approached by  many owners of power plants as the markets further deregulate and some of the  owners of ""hard assets"" realize that they do not have the resources necessary  to participate in the wholesale power markets.  And, with the further market  participant fall-out to come (witness PacifiCorp's retrenchment announcement  on Friday), ECT could end up with a larger share of this market perhaps  resulting in multiple deals with third parties, even parties whose facilities  may be viewed in competition with one another (based on load pockets, grid  interconnection, etc.).  I agree with you that these deals carry a lot of  legal risk because of ECT's commanding presence in these markets.  In addition, I found the PECO marketing contract with Great Bay Power (""GBP"")  that, as you know, resulted in litigation earlier this year.  I faxed it to  you this morning along with a copy of the complaint that GBP filed against  PECO earlier this year.  Set forth below are a few of the key aspects of the  PECO/GBP Contract that I thought you might find of interest, including some  of the contract language that bears on the fiduciary duty/ principal-agent  considerations.  I thought it made sense to focus on some of these, not  because it is a great contract, but I think it illustrates many of the  concepts that your commercial people may wish to employ in the proposed  marketing deals they are currently examining.  Further, you will see how many  of the key provisions dealing with the key legal concepts are either unclear  or confusing or never really addressed.  1.  Term; Exclusive Agent Relationship.  The Contract was for an initial term  of 2 years.  PECO is designated to act as GBP's exclusive agent in marketing  the power from GBP's only asset; namely, its interest in the Seabrook nuclear  plant.  Except as noted in Paragraph 2 below, GBP could not sell to customers  without PECO's consent.  GBP apparently sought the PECO deal since it needed  a party to ""firm up"" its sales; that is, it needed a party to back up its  Seabrook power in the event Seabrook went down.  GBP retained title to all  power until title passed to third parties.  Of further note is that in  connection with the contract PECO also received a warrant to purchase up to  4.9% of the stock of GBP.  (This is similar to what ECT proposed with El Paso  a year or so ago, but ECT proposed a warrant to purchase a greater percentage  of the stock of El Paso.)  Note that the 4.9% limit is '35 Act driven.  More  than 4.9% would be a ""second bite"" under the '35 Act that would require prior  SEC approval and, in addition, could be problematic for PECO under the  limitations of such Act.  2.  PECO's Authority to Effect Deals for GBP.  PECO could effect transactions  for GBP, although it could not execute deals of  more than a year in duration  without GBP's consent.  PECO also had the right to negotiate ""on behalf of""  GBP enabling agreements (such as those necessary to effect NEPOOL  transactions), although those agreements would only become effective upon  GBP's consent (which could not be unreasonably withheld).  Notwithstanding  the foregoing, GBP could cause PECO to offer a sale of power on terms  directed by GBP if the sale was for longer than six months, provided GBP  could not require PECO to firm up such sale.  If PECO felt this was not the  best course of action, it could terminate the Contract.  3.  PECO Standard of Care.  Sec. 4(a) of the Contract provides that ""PECO  shall use 'reasonable best efforts' to arrange for the sale of the [GBP  Power]"" and that it ""shall use the same care and diligence in arranging  Transactions [involving the GBP power] as it uses in the sale of capacity  and/or energy owned by PECO.""  PECO was authorized and required to use  ""reasonable judgment"" during the negotiation and scheduling of transactions  under the Contract.  4.  Conflicting Sales Opportunities.  Sec. 4(c) denominated ""Bundling of  Initial Power Amount"" is of particular interest.  Effectively, this provision  requires that if some of the GBP power is available but not committed and  PECO has other NEPOOL power available to it that can be used to effect a  sale, then PECO shall be obligated to serve each such sale with both the GBP  power and its own NEPOOL resources ""until the [GBP power] is fully  utilized.""  It is not exactly clear how this provision is intended to work,  but I would assume that if PECO located a candidate for a sale transaction  and PECO could use its own NEPOOL power  (defined as ""Other NEPOOL Supply"")  to serve it or, alternatively, it could use the GBP power, then PECO would  have to make the sale using both sources of power.  It is not clear whether  PECO would have to apply the GBP first or whether a pro rata concept (perhaps  based on the ratio of the GBP power to the total power available) would be  permissible.  Obviously, this type of a provision would have major  implications for the considerations we have been discussing since ECT would  not want to be required either to use its counterparty's power first to make  a sale or to apply some form of pro rata concept (which would be incredibly  difficult to apply and a ticket to litigation).  5.  Notice of Conflicting Opportunities.  Sec. 4(d) of the Contract,  denominated ""Economic Disincentive,"" similarly is interesting (and  confusing).  It provides, in effect, that if a portion of the GBP power is  uncommitted but PECO owns Other NEPOOL Supply and PECO would make more of a  margin by selling the Other NEPOOL Supply for its own account than effecting  a deal for the GBP power, then ""PECO shall notify GBP of such  circumstances.""  What is interesting is that it just requires PECO to notify  GBP; it does not appear that there is any restriction on PECO's right to sell  such power, except perhaps the restriction set forth in Sec. 4(c) above.   Perhaps the negotiators of the Contract know how these provisions tie  together, but it is not clear from the Contract itself.  This is very  surprising since one would think that it would have been in both parties'  interests to make it absolutely clear how the fiduciary duty/corporate  opportunity responsibilities were to be handled.  6.  Compensation.  With respect to compensation, PECO paid GBP a ""reservation  fee"" in consideration of GBP retaining PECO as its exclusive agent, which was  based on a $ per MWh basis.  GBP paid a ""service fee"" to PECO based on a % of  net sales revenues.  (It really wasn't on a net basis, however, since it  effectively was based on gross revenues less transmission and ancillary  services costs).  7.  Commitments for Future Opportunities.  Another interesting feature of the  Contract was the parties' commitments to engage in ""future joint  opportunities.""  For example, Sec. 13(a) states that ""PECO shall be obligated  to provide Great Bay with the opportunity to participate in all purchases of  [additional favorably priced power from facilities in New England having a  term in excess of 1 year]."" (Emphasis added).  As with many other provisions  of the Contract, it is not clear what happens if PECO and GBP do not agree on  the sharing of costs, revenues, etc. with respect to such additional  opportunities.  8.  Early Termination Rights.  In addition to termination for a breach of the  Contract, GBP could terminate upon 30 days notice prior to certain dates  (tied to the warrant expiration date).  PECO, as noted at paragraph 2 above,  could terminate on 90 days notice if GBP elected to effect a sale on its won  (that essentially PECO felt would not maximize the parties' profits).  9.  Choice of Law.  PECO was able to get Pennsylvania law to be the governing  law.  Presumably, this was a function of the fact that GBP had less  negotiating leverage and ""needed"" PECO to help it with firming up its sales.  10.  The Litigation.  In its complaint, GBP alleged, among other things, that  since inception of the Contract PECO only effected two firm energy  transactions for GBP.  In addition, it asserted that PECO entered into a  number of wholesale transactions for its own benefit, rather than in the name  of GBP.  I apologize for the length of this E-mail, but in light of the importance of  these issues to the deals ECT is considering, I thought it made sense to give  a flavor of the PECO/GBP contract.

"Elizabeth,  Per my voice mail here is what credit wants to explore.  If we have an ISDA  in place with a non-regulated affiliate of a utility, they want to create  some credit triggers that would be based on events that occur with respect to  our counterparty's regulated utility affiliate.  Can this be done?  Could we,  for example, have a drop in the credit rating of the utility trigger a MAC?   Could we cross default to the utility's physical and/or financial  transactions?  I know that there are limitations on what can be done, I just  didn't know how extensive they were.

"Wes  Here is current draft of CDWR agreement.  Negotiations are still underway.   The underlying contract is the EEI Master - let me know if you need that  standard form. Call w/ any questions/comments  Elizabeth  36349 ----- Forwarded by Elizabeth Sager/HOU/ECT on 03/20/2001 04:32 PM -----   ""JOHN G KLAUBERG"" <JKLAUBER@LLGM.COM>  03/20/2001 10:18 AM        To: jpirog@water.ca.gov    cc: cyoder@ect.enron.com, Elizabeth.Sager@enron.com, ""MICHAEL W E DIDRIKSEN""  <MDIDRIKSEN@LLGM.COM>    Subject: Revised Draft   John:  as per your request, attached are revised drafts of the Confirmation  and Cover Sheet, which are blacklined against the respective documents from  the short-term deal.  I recognize that you are still reviewing certain  questions/points with CDWR and there may be some items reflected in this  draft that neither you nor CDWR has ""signed off"" on.  Nonetheless, in certain  cases I thought it made sense to provide you with specific contract language  on some of the points we discussed so that you could clearly see what we may  be proposing on a particular item.  Please note, in particular, the following:  --on the LD calculation, we reverted to your proposed language on obtaining  multiple market quotes, etc.  However, after talking to Enron this evening,  we would like to propose that if quotes cannot be obtained despite the  parties' good faith efforts to do so, then only in that circumstance would  the calculation be based on the Non-Defaulting Party's losses.  While, based  on the product Enron is selling, we anticipate that quotes will be readily  obtainable, we think it makes sense to revert to the Non-Defaulting Party's  loss calculation in the highly unlikely event that quotes are not obtainable  despite using all efforts to do so.  I know that you expressed some  reservations the other evening that this process potentially could be subject  to some manipulation.  This is not so.  If CDWR was the Defaulting Party and  it disputes the loss calculation made by Enron, such dispute would become the  subject of arbitration.  In such case, the Non-Defaulting Party's would have  to furnish its historical and current power curves to prove its case.  Since  those same figures necessarily are needed by Enron to report its trading  positions on a day to day basis as part of its normal business operations and  such information feeds directly into its financial reporting statements and  other relevant financial information, etc. that becomes, in part, part of its  SEC filings, in a discovery proceeding this information would be very  transparent.  --with respect to the situs of any arbitration proceeding, Enron strongly  believes that it is only fair to both parties that this be conducted in a  neutral site.  The draft provides for New York City, although Enron is open  to other possible locations.  --the revised draft reflects only the $127/MWh alternative scenario since you  indicated that, preliminarily, you felt that CDWR would not be likely to  choose the alternative structure we had discussed.  --we would like to further discuss the effect of an adverse federal  regulatory change.  I'm sure you can appreciate this in light of the current  environment, although we would think that freely negotiated bilateral  contracts would not be subject to the types of changes being discussed.   Enron is not seeking a termination right with LDs, but would like to further  discuss a termination right without compensation in the event of a major  adverse federal development affecting the contract.  --we have dropped our request that Enron have the right to suspend  performance in the case of a Bond downgrade event.  However, we think it is  appropriate that if that circumstance occurs, that the due date for payments  by CDWR should shorten to 7 days and if the Bonds are subsequently upgraded  that the payment schedule would revert accordingly.  --you requested that we propose a limit on the right of a Non-Defaulting  Party to suspend its performance in the case of a Default by the Defaulting  Party.  We included a 60-NERC day limit on such right in the revised draft.   This is important to Enron as we discussed, particularly in light of Enron's  acceptance of the 180 day period on the timing of a Termination Payment  which, as you know, is unheard of in the power sale (or virtually any other)  arena.  (Nonetheless, we fully understand the position enunciated by the bond  people on this point).  --on assignment, the Enron commercial people cannot agree to a pre-approved  right of CDWR to assign the contract to the IOUs.  As we discussed, it may  very well be the case that at the time any assignment were to be effected  that Enron may already be at the limit of its overall exposure with those  counter parties.  It can't be in a position where such an assignment could  cause it to violate those limits.  --we included an outside date by which Enron must decide whether or not to go  forward of the first to occur of (1) September 30, 2001 or (2) seven days  after the Bonds are issued.  You had indicated that CDWR might be willing to  consider such an ""outside date"" as long as (i) the $127/MWh pricing was in  effect from April 1 and (2) Enron had to act very shortly after the Bonds are  issued.  We have proposed 7 days for this.  --in concept, we probably will be ok with the alternative of securing a  credit rating for the Fund (as opposed to the Bonds), although we have  referred that question to the credit people to make sure.  --in light of your response about opinions not being provided by outside  counsel, we modified the confirmation to request that the opinions could be  from the AG, or if CDWR cannot do that, then from the GC of CDWR.  We felt  that this would not involve additional work since these presumably will be  rendered in connection with the Bonds and we provided that they generally  would be provided to us after the Bonds are issued.  I think the foregoing represent most of the items we had discussed.  Please  let me know when you wish to discuss.  Also, it may make sense for our next  call to have the respective Enron and CDWR commercial folks on the call since  it may be the case that many of the final decisions involved may be  commercial ones.  Lastly, please note that while we have discussed most of the points addressed  in the revised drafts with Enron, in order to expedite the process, we are  sending these drafts simultaneously to you and Enron.  Thus, it is possible  that Enron may have further modifications or changes to the documents.  Thanks.  We look forward to working with you to finalize the requisite  documents.

"Elizabeth: I had a question about a recurring provision that I have seen in your Power  Contracts.  Looks like our credit group accepts a Guaranty from a  Counterparty's Credit Support Provider as a form of Performance Assurance to  satisfy any collateral posting requirements.  On the financial side,  Guarantys always supplement the colateral requirements such that we require  them to post cash or LC's to us even if we are holding a parent Guaranty.   Why is there a different approach on the power side?  Alos, how does credit  value a parent guaranty?  For example, if the parent's financial condition  worsens, does the value of the Guaranty drop?

In order to reduce Enron's non-market risks ( e.g. legal, credit  and regulatory) in the volatile commodity markets in California or any ""  future California"", we propose the following changes:  1.    Mandatory Uniform Set-Off Provisions in All Trading Contracts for All  Commodities -- set-off language varies commodity by commodity in trading  contracts.  Set-off is one of the most critical tools available to Enron in a  major default situation and it is critical to have set-off language and to  have it be uniform commodity to commodity so that Enron can get the best  advantage from set-off and not just the least common denominator.  2.     Mandatory Master Netting Agreements For Counterparties With Multiple  Masters With Significant Opposite Exposures -- where it is necessary to have  multiple masters with a counterparty, a ""bridge"" should be put place between  the masters whenever there is significant opposite exposures under the two or  more masters.  3.     Merge EPMI into ENA -- power trades are done through EPMI.  Merging  EPMI into ENA and conducting power trades through ENA is much more efficient  from both a credit and legal point of view.  4.     No Automatic Termination for a Bankruptcy Event --   Let me know if you have any other proposed changes to our trading contracts  or entities through which we conduct our trading.  I believe these changes  will (i) improve efficiency, (ii) reduce risks, (iii) develop the opportunity  to do more business with certain counterparties and (iv)substanially improve  Enron's position in the next California type market.  The long range goal is  conduct as much as possible of the trading business through a single entity  and a single or limited number standardized agreements.

"Elizabeth:  We followed up on our discussions last week regarding the consequences of a  possible bankruptcy of a municipal counterparty and our ability to terminate  and liquidate our positions in such event, without regard to the generally  applicable automatic stay.  Attached is a brief memo discussing this issue.   The principal points to note are as follows:  (1) Municipalities, if they were to file for bankruptcy, do so under Chapter  9 of the Bankruptcy Code (""BC"")--e.g., Orange County, CA.  (2) The ""forward contract"" exception to the automatic stay found in Sec. 556  of the BC presently is not explicitly made applicable to filings pursuant to  Chapter 9.  As you recall, Sec. 556 allows termination of a forward contract  because of the commencement of a bankruptcy case notwithstanding the general  prohibition for termination of executory contracts for such grounds in Sec.  365.  This appears to have been an oversight when Sec. 556 was added to the  BC in 1982 (according to the National Bankruptcy Review Commission) and  probably has not been a ""high on the agenda item"" to correct due to the fact  that Chapter 9 bankruptcies are relatively rare.  (3) It appears that the other amendments to the BC dealing with forward  contracts are applicable to Chapter 9, such as Sec. 362 (b) (6) which allows  the non-defaulting party to setoff or settle without regards to the stay if  there is an existing default other than an insolvency event.  Also note that  Colliers on Bankruptcy, the ""Bible"" in this area, suggests that one can  nonetheless make the argument that the forward contract exception can be read  to apply to Chapter 9 filings under present law (see also the discussion at  (6) below)--although it is uncertain whether a bankruptcy court would accept  this argument to effectively write something into the statute.  (4) There currently is pending legislation that has been passed by both the  House and the Senate (and is now the subject of a joint House/Senate  Conference Committee) that would make it clear that the forward contract  exception to the automatic stay shall apply to Chapter 9 bankruptcies.   Adding Sec. 556 to Sec. 901 (the section delineating which sections are  applicable to Chapter 9 bankruptcies) is not controversial and should survive  the joint conference committee since similar provisions exist in both the  House and Senate bills. These provisions are part of the overall legislation  making fundamental changes in the BC (that has received a lot of press and  which is controversial in terms of how it treats individual consumers filing  for bankruptcy).  Our sense, however, is that the bill will be passed and  signed by President Bush.  (5) Assuming the amendments to Chapter 9 filings are enacted, under the  existing bills they would first become effective for bankruptcy cases filed  after 180 days after the legislation is signed by the President.  Thus, to  the extent that ENA has existing contracts with municipalities, ENA would be  permitted to exercise its termination and liquidation rights thereunder  without regard to the automatic stay as long as the municipal counter party  does not file within 6 months after the date the legislation is signed.  (6) It is worth noting that the legislative committee reports describing the  changes provide that Congress is ""clarifying"" that the forward contract  provisions of the BC apply to municipal bankruptcies, noting that these  provisions ""by their terms are intended to apply to all proceedings under  Title 11"" (which includes Chapter 9 proceedings).  The Senate Report  goes on  to say that:  ""Although sections...556...provide that they apply in any  proceeding under the Bankruptcy Code, this subsection makes a technical  amendment in chapter 9 to clarify the applicability of these provisions.""   (Emphasis added).  Thus, this committee language would appear to support an  argument that Sec. 556 applies to Chapter 9 bankruptcies under Congress's  interpretation of existing law--obviously, the hoped for result from ENA's  standpoint.  (7) For your information, when Orange County, CA, filed for bankruptcy the  County filed under Chapter 9.  The investment pool that held the derivatives  and other financial contracts initially also made a separate filing under  Chapter 9. This filing was dismissed, essentially on the basis the investment  pool was not eligible for relief under Chapter 9 because it did not qualify  as a ""municipality"" and it had not been specifically authorized to file under  Chapter 9.  The dealers and brokerage houses terminated and liquidated their  positions shortly after the initial filing, based on their belief that the  investment pool's use of Chapter 9 was improper.  Their terminations and  liquidations were not undone.  (8) Lastly, as mentioned above, you should note that even if Sec. 556 is not  applicable to Chapter 9 filings under existing law, if ENA terminated a power  contract with a municipality prior to the filing date for a reason other than  the act of filing a bankruptcy petition (e.g., a bond downgrade; failure to  post collateral; a cross default; the existence of a condition where the  counterparty is ""unable to pay its debts as they come due,"" etc.), ENA would  be permitted to proceed with the liquidation of its position (and it could  exercise any set off or settlement rights) without regard to the automatic  stay.  Hopefully, the pending legislation will be passed and the concern as to the  applicability of Sec. 556 to municipalities will be completely eliminated  within a relatively short period of time.  In the interim, particularly  during the upcoming summer (when prices in many locations will be highly  volatile and certain parties' credit positions could fluctuate rapidly and  materially in some cases, particularly if they are filling open positions in  the spot market), it may make sense to alert our credit group to be  particularly vigilant in their monitoring of the ongoing financial condition  of our municipal counterparties so that we preserve as much flexibility as  possible with respect to exercising our termination rights under the  contracts on account of defaults other than the filing of a bankruptcy  petition by or against our counterparty.  Please give me (or Carl, 303 291-2630, or Jim, 303 291-2632) a call if you  want to follow up on any of this.  Thanks.

Answer:  EPMI objects to this request in that it is vague and ambiguous,  particularly in its use of the term ""agreed to go forward.""  Subject to and  without waiving this objection, EPMI denies this request.  Interrogatory - If your answer to the preceding request for Admission is  other than an unqualified admission, state in detail the basis for your  denial or qualification of the admission.  Answer:  EPMI objects to this interrogatory for the reasons stated in its  response to the preceding request for admission.  Subject to and without  waiving this objection, EPMI states that CPSC made no apparent effort to seek  LCRA's consent to an assignment as contemplated by the July 30, 1999.  In  telephone conversations in the late afternoon of the last day for the parties  to have entered into such an assignment pursuant to the terms of the July 30,  1999 letter agreement (which conversations were initiated by EPMI several  days earlier) CPSC indicated that it would begin to negotiate an assignment  without a parent guarantee, but CPSC did not, in fact, agree to an assignment  before the expiration of the time period contemplated by the July 30, 1999  letter agreement.  After that time had expired, CPSC did not continue  negotiations with EPMI. Let me know what you think.  Bonnie J.

In order to reduce Enron's non-market risks ( e.g. legal, credit  and regulatory) in the volatile commodity markets in California or any ""  future California"", we propose the following changes:  1.    Mandatory Uniform Set-Off Provisions in All Trading Contracts for All  Commodities -- set-off language varies commodity by commodity in trading  contracts.  Set-off is one of the most critical tools available to Enron in a  major default situation and it is critical to have set-off language and to  have it be uniform commodity to commodity so that Enron can get the best  advantage from set-off and not just the least common denominator.  2.     Mandatory Master Netting Agreements For Counterparties With Multiple  Masters With Significant Opposite Exposures -- where it is necessary to have  multiple masters with a counterparty, a ""bridge"" should be put place between  the masters whenever there is significant opposite exposures under the two or  more masters.  3.     Merge EPMI into ENA -- power trades are done through EPMI.  Merging  EPMI into ENA and conducting power trades through ENA is much more efficient  from both a credit and legal point of view.  4.     No Automatic Termination for a Bankruptcy Event --   Let me know if you have any other proposed changes to our trading contracts  or entities through which we conduct our trading.  I believe these changes  will (i) improve efficiency, (ii) reduce risks, (iii) develop the opportunity  to do more business with certain counterparties and (iv)substanially improve  Enron's position in the next California type market.  The long range goal is  conduct as much as possible of the trading business through a single entity  and a single or limited number standardized agreements.

The NY PSC seems to  have adopted this on their own (or with the support of the local utility).    Howard Fromer (our NY reg affairs guy) indicates that the NY PSC was simply  looking for a deep market index they could use to establish ""non-switching""  customer rates.  Howard has spoken with Dana Davis about publishing off-peak  and on-peak prices and he said that the Desk could do it.  One other thing.  PGE is looking to transact with EPMI through EOL.  We are  preparing a filing at FERC that would modify PGE's Code of Conduct to allow  this.  There is a risk that FERC will use this filing (while small) to look  again at ""regulating"" EOL.  Remember that APX is regulated by FERC.  I agree that we need to be more coordinated with EOL and state regulators  (FERC is in the loop and we have had discussions with them).    Of course, as our involvement in the markets through EOL continues to grow,  regulators will begin to take a deeper look.  Lisa Yoho and I can come by today to discuss more fully if you'd like.

This is not good news at all  (as indicated below) and has regulatory implications for EnronOnline - I  presume we did not encourage this in any way or have any agreement in place.    Did we have any involvement in the process at all or is this something one of  your guys picked up - Anyway Andy Zipper is back today so I am sure he will  handle this.  Physically they cannot get the prices and we don't (I think) publish power  indices on EOL.   I hope we haven't been the people pushing this as that would be a real  problem and shows immense lack of co-ordination.

In an Order issued by the NYPSC on  March 29, the NYPSC has approved a proposal to modify the existing fixed  backout credit of 2.8 cents per kwh for energy and capacity and replace it  with a market-based backout credit. The additional retail adder of 0.4 cents  per kwh would remain.  Load-serving entities (LSEs) will have the option of  continuing to buy their energy and capacity from RG&E at the market based  backout credit which will be determined 15 days prior to the beginning of  each of the two six-month capability periods, and will be based on ""a  forecast of energy prices derived from Enron Corporation's (Enron)  EnronOnline trading platform.""  To my knowledge, this is the first occasion  that a regulatory body has agreed to use Enron Online as an index!  LSEs can  elect instead to procure their own commodity and get a market-based backout  credit (MBBC). Under this option, the LSEs will get a market based backout  credit. However, the Enron online prices for the six months determined as  above will be reconciled on a lag basis against actual market prices.  The  PSC has capped the amount of the reconciliation for any LSE to the product of  the LSE's total load for the calendar year and $0.065 per kwh (PSC staff's  estimate of RG&E's embedded power supply cost).  (The PSC Order actually says  $0.015 but this appears to be a mistake since the attached settlement states  $0.065.) A copy of the PSC's Order is available on its website:   www.dps.state.ny.us             ",elizabeth.sager@enron.com,sarah.novosel@enron.com,Re: NYPSC Adopts Enron Online as Index,2001-04-05 11:14:00-07:00,received

(NYSE:CPN <http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=cpn&d=t> - news </n/c/cpn.html>) said  on Monday that bankrupt utility Pacific Gas and Electric was in breach of  contract after failing to make some $267 million in payments and it would  seek prompt court action to secure payment or be freed from its energy  contracts. ADVERTISEMENT   <http://rd.yahoo.com/M=183981.1387645.2975805.1320407/D=fin/S=7811756:LREC/A=6 31358/R=0/*http://www.hrblock.com/taxes/partners/yahoo/index.html >  <http://rd.yahoo.com/M=183981.1387645.2975805.1320407/D=fin/S=7811756:LREC/A=6 31358/R=0/*http://www.hrblock.com/taxes/partners/yahoo/index.html > ``Right now there is breach of contract'' for power Calpine has provided  Pacific Gas and Electric, Calpine senior vice president Lisa Bodensteiner  told an analysts teleconference.  ``We are filing motions this week with the bankruptcy court to direct PG&E to  pay us. If it doesn't decide this, we will then ask the court to relieve of  us of our contacts and let us sell to the open market,'' she said.  San Jose, Calif.-based Calpine said in a statement earlier Monday it was  confident PG&E would be able to pay Calpine's 11 qualifying facility  subsidiaries (QFs) for past-due power sales.  Calpine's 11 QF plants, which generate around 600 megawatts of power from  small natural gas-fired and geothermal plants, are part of a fleet of  qualifying facilities that can produce up to about a third of all the power  generated in California.  As of March 31, Pacific Gas and Electric owed a total of $643 million for  power the QFs have supplied to its customers, according to the California  Public Utilities.  PG&E must assume Calpine's contracts in its bankruptcy proceedings for them  to continue, Calpine said.  PG&E Corp. (NYSE:PCG <http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=pcg&d=t> - news  </n/p/pcg.html>) unit Pacific Gas and Electric Co., California's largest  inverstor-owned utility, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on Friday  after piling up around $9 billion in wholesale power costs it has not been  able to recover due to California's 1996 deregulation legislation.  Calpine senior vice president Jim Macias told analysts that if PG&E ``were  dumb enough'' not to affirm the contracts, Calpine could make an extra $380  million selling the energy tied up in its QF contracts with PG&E on the open  spot market.  ``We are in constant discussions with state municipal utilities and the state  to sell our power. We are very confident we will be able to move this energy  should the contacts be rejected,'' Macias said.  He estimated spot electricity prices in the state are currently about $260  per megawatt hour.  A Calpine spokeswoman said Monday the company's QF facilities operated when  California declared power emergencies, but could not comment on whether they  operate when an alert is not called.  In addition to the $267 million currently owed, San Francisco-based Calpine  also holds a long-term $68 million note receivable with PG&E for energy  deliveries from 2003 to 2014, but that the note is note yet due.  Calpine, which said it did not expect the $267 million PG&E owes it to grow,  said the utility had paid 15 percent of what PG&E owes it for energy  delivered in December and January, but had not paid anything since.  Calpine, which has its own natural gas storage reserves in Sacramento,  Calif., also said it expected to make payments to its gas suppliers.

"Elizabeth,  I decided this weekend that I would like to go to the conference if there is  still room.  In addition to the educational benefits, BPA may be sending some  folks, which would give you and I an additional opportunity to sell  them on  the EEI in a more relaxed setting (perhaps over dinner?).  Do you have a list  of conference attendees?      Also, as you know, we are trying to get an EEI in place with WAPA.  Because  of the PG&E bankruptcy, WAPA and its customers cannot count on PG&E  deliveries, and are therefore looking to cover perhaps 500 MW.  However,  there is a bottleneck in the WAPA organization that is preventing  implementation of an EEI, and therefore preventing EPMI from getting the  business.  It would be helpful to know if WAPA is sending anyone.       Also, if many customers or potential customers are attending, Stewart Rosman  and possibly other traders may be interested in going to develop business.   (Stewart expressed his interest.)  What do you think about that idea?  Best,  Steve ",elizabeth.sager@enron.com,steve.hall@enron.com,EEI Conference,2001-04-10 04:55:00-07:00,received

"One hundred and forty two hours ago, I wandered into the Houston Casino, not  really sure why other than a free floating anxiety that could only be  appeased by attending to the ministerial tasks in life that so frequently  make us forget how good life is.  So after a rousing game of tennis on Friday  morning while my children were frolicking with Dede's 3 children at the  Houston Country Club, I tackled my desk and made head way to no where. After  trashing 457 emails, I opened the the 458th.  And then it came to me.  An  epic. A history. A sense of time, commitment and value. A place where my  roots are (as you all know, my mom and dad are buried in a family graveyard  200 feet from the only barn not burned in the Shenandoah valley during the  Civil War and which was used a Yankee hospital).  And of course there is the  hope of sustaining energy to cope with this lackluster, stressful career in  the Casino.   And the Gods must have seen this coming too.  Being meager and always wanting  to commit small, I sought only volume 1 of the opus.  Not to be found.   Plenty of volume 2s and 3s but not a volume 1 to be found.  Other than in the  sole, 3 volume set, neatly packages in the box, high up on a lonely shelf.  I  knew I was on the right track when the person behind me tried to grab it out  of my hands.  I fought and won.  I'm now on page 32 having met Jefferson Davis and Dear Abe.  At this rate  I'll be finished in about 4 years, a true history of the war.

"Liz   Attached are suggested changes to the Long Description to more closely align  the Into product in the EEI with the EOL Into product.   The Force Majeure relief for this particular product has been clarified to  ensure that Force Majeure relief is not available in the event that non-firm  transmission is scheduled.    If we add the EEI definition of Force Majeure, the applicability or otherwise  to certain products would need to be set out in the Long Description. At this  stage, since we are focusing on the Into product, I would propose that the  GTCs remain the same, until we make the more widesweeping change to bring EOL  in line with EEI.   When you are back lets meet to discuss how  best to take this forward.   As to the broader change to reflect the EEI, we will need to consider how to  deal with the issues on the Cover Sheet. The credit terms are probably not  something that we can achieve ""click"" approvals of just yet, however the  changes we would like to see to the EEI could obviously be included as part  of the ""click"" and accept concept on EOL.  I will be giving this further  thought and will make some recommendations when I have had the opportunity to  go through the documents and the issues which will need to be addressed.   As a preliminary point, is it your understanding that, provided we display  the  attribution to the copyright owners on the Website, we will not need to  obtain any further licenses? This is not clear on the face of the document  which does not envisage that the document will be displayed as part of a  website's terms and conditions, capable of acceptance. Is there a licence I  could have a look at, for example? I am concerned that the digital rights may  still be retained by the copyright owners, however having regard to the  tremendous exposure and endorsement the document would receive by being used  on EOL, I would hope that any licenses, if required, could be concluded  quickly and at no cost to EOL.

I tried to include a blackline, but it seemed to  get corrupted so I don't know if it will be of much use to you. A few notes:  (1)  I did not have the various contracts with me when I reviewed this, but I  have asked Jim if he could make sure I did not make any inaccurate statements  as well as input the few contract section references that are open and the  information on the Canadian termination.  (However, I was not sure whether  you wanted Peter Keohane to input the relevant information on the Canadian  side.).  (2)  In light of PG&E's letter to us, I thought we may want to make some  short statements about the affiliate set off rights under the Bankruptcy Code  in the termination letter.  (3)  I modified some of the language on the CalPX liabilities.  I didn't have  my exposure sheet with me, but I thought I recall that we were both owed  money from the CalPX  and that we had some risk on the chargeback liability  depending on how FERC ultimately comes out on the issue.  As you know, the  FERC decision about 3 weeks ago prohibited the CalPX from proceeding with the  chargeback ""under these circumstances"" or some type of language like this,  but it seemed to have punted the final resolution of the issue until at least  the commandeered contract valuation issue had been resolved--thus, although  perhaps not likely, it seemed to me at the time that FERC gave itself an  opening to reconsider the chargeback issue after the valuation determination  had been made.  (4)  While I bracketed the language, I thought we may want to affirmatively  and briefly set forth the business reason why EPMI is holding the direct  access claim to at least give them something to think about.  As we have  discussed, PG&E's likely reaction will be that we are using unsupportable  self help to not pay them anything on the termination of the 3 power  confirmations by claiming a set off for the negative CTCs.  To the extent we  can articulate a short business rationale for EPMI having that claim, it may  at least make them pause as to whether our business rationale arguably could  prevail.  (5)  We note in the letter certain claims we have against PG&E that we are  not setting off--e.g., the ISDA termination payment.  We also reference the  claims held by EPMI through the CalPX, even though we are not ""terminating""  any ""contracts"" in that respect.  I assume that we do not want to reference  in the letter the claims held by Portland General which ""route"" through the  CalPX and the ISO, even though we are not claiming rights of offset for  those.  PG&E will be put on notice of those when we put in Portland's claims  as part of our proof of claim with the bankruptcy court.   I'll plan on getting together with you to review this tomorrow afternoon.   Lastly, I have not read the decision yet, but I saw that the DC Circuit  upheld FERC in all respects in the PCA case so since our contracts do not  have to be on file, they can be terminated without waiting for the 60 day  period to expire.  That should reduce another potential challenge to the  power contract termination.  Thanks.

The question of party representation in conference continues to stall efforts  to bring the issue of bankruptcy reform to a close. Democrats, who occupy  half of the Senate's seats, are insisting upon equal representation in  conference, while Republicans oppose it.  Efforts to forego a conference with the House are unlikely to succeed given  House leadership concerns about a number of controversial amendments the  Senate made to S. 420 before passing it. In particular, many Republicans  object to provisions opposed by President Bush that are intended to make it  harder for debtors to shield assets by purchasing expensive homes in states  that bar creditors from seizing the homes in bankruptcy auctions.  ""There has been no resolution yet,"" Daschle said. ""I would say that I think  both [Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott (R-Miss.)] and I and our staffs are  working to try to resolve his concern, which is what do you do in a tie ...  You know, I think what happens in a tie is [that] you just keep talking until  you break the tie.""  Daschle said he is looking for an ""opportunity to break through,"" but has yet  to find one. Regardless, Daschle said he does not think ""tie votes are all  that big a problem, either in conference or in committee.""  With Daschle voting in the affirmative, the Senate March 14 approved 80-19 a  cloture motion Lott filed late March 12. Sen. Paul Wellstone (D-Minn.), the  bill's most outspoken opponent, argued passionately against cloture and Sen.  Harry Reid (D-Nev.) foiled an attempt by Lott to secure unanimous consent to  prepare the bill for a conference with House members after the bill passed  the Senate March 15.  In general, the bills aim to force more bankruptcy filers to file under  Chapter 13, which requires some repayment of debts, instead of Chapter 7. The  bills are a copy of last year's conference report worked out between the  House and the Senate, which former President Clinton pocket-vetoed in  December.

The bill would apply to any company selling gas or electricity into the state or to any of the state=01,s utilities, said a spokesman for Cardoza.  Under terms of the proposed legislation, offenders would be subject to California=01,s ""three strikes"" law, which sentences convicted felons to jail for life after three offenses. Directors, officers or any other employees associated with market manipulation of a company would be subject to this bill, the spokesman said.  Cardoza will introduce the bill at a press conference today at 2 p.m. Pacific time. CD  ______________________________________________________________________   No easy solutions to crisis  The crisis in California is far beyond short-term fixes parading as potential solutions, and there is no turning back for deregulation in the state, according to a report released yesterday by consulting firm Andersen.  California has no choice but to forge ahead in repairing the damage that ill-planned deregulation measures have caused, the Energy Crisis in the Western U.S.: Lessons for navigating regulatory and market minefields report says. ""There=01,s a common wisdom that knows you can=01,t unscramble the egg,"" said Matt Smith, head of Andersen=01,s North American energy consulting practice. All that can be done is correct the mistakes, he added. In addition, steps must be implemented to prevent the spread of the California ""virus"" to other states=01, electricity marketplaces, Smith said.  ""To begin, in our view, the energy crisis in the western U.S. has produced formidable challenges for utility industry regulators, state and federal policymakers, and industry executives,"" Smith said. ""The virus spawned in California requires new strategies to contain and reverse the damage.  ""The implications for the development of competitive energy markets go far beyond the western United States. Unfortunately, California has taught the nation that regulatory and political barriers can create and sustain an energy crisis.""  The proposed solutions put in motion by federal and state regulators, as well as California policymakers, have only led to an increasingly uncertain market and tension among those working for a viable resolution, the report says.  ""In reaction to the breakdown, many of California=01,s political leaders now prefer to abandon deregulation,"" the report says.  The report concludes that power shortages and blackouts are inevitable this summer. The deregulated marketplace, which took a year to throw off track, will more than likely take a number of years to put right, the report says. MCM  ________________________________________________________   Competing evidence clouds Calif. investigation  Prompted in part by the California Public Utilities Commission, the=20 California Assembly has been scrutinizing the role that interstate pipelines have played in the= =20 state=01,s current energy crisis. In the efforts to find a smoking gun, legislators have leane= d=20 heavily on a report prepared by The Brattle Group, a consultancy commissioned by utility= =20 Southern California Edison to dig up evidence of market power abuse.  But the state=01,s biggest transporter of gas to California -- El Paso Natu= ral=20 Gas -- is not ready to take the rap. The pipeline has commissioned its own study, which i= t=20 recently presented as evidence that it has not circumvented any laws or regulation.  As reported in both the trade press and national media, SoCal Ed and the CP= UC=20 are pointing the finger of blame at El Paso for alleged manipulation of California borde= r=20 prices through affiliate deals and capacity hoarding. And exhibit A in their case against = El=20 Paso is The Brattle Group=01,s study of the California market.  Richard Zeiger, a spokesman for Assembly Member Darrell Steinberg, chairman= =20 of the California Assembly Judiciary Committee, told Gas Daily that The Brattle=20 Group=01,s market study proved that the surge in gas prices at the California border was not= =20 caused by normal market forces (GD 4/20). His remarks followed an oversight hearing during= =20 which Assembly members questioned Dynegy and El Paso officials about their involvement in= =20 the California market.  El Paso presented a different version of events to the Assembly. In a repor= t=20 presented to legislators, a research group hired by El Paso concluded that a convergence= =20 of factors, not a conspiracy, caused the price run-up.  Lukens Consulting Group, a Houston-based consultancy, was retained by El Pa= so=20 to conduct work on several fronts. In its study of the California market, Lukens=20 concluded that the increasing convergence of the gas and electricity businesses was one of the= =20 main culprits in the California gas price imbroglio.  Assemblyman John Campbell, a Republican member of the oversight committee,= =20 said he ""didn=01,t see any smoking gun"" in either report.  ""We had our committee hearing, and we certainly had a lot on the Brattle=20 Study and a little on the Lukens study. To some degree, I=01,m not sure that the California=20 legislature is the best place to adjudicate the differences between these two studies,"" Campbell=20 said. ""I believe FERC is looking at this situation "" and it would seem to me that that=01,s the= =20 appropriate place.""  Campbell said that the CPUC had been prodding the California legislature to= =20 give support to its claims of market power abuse by pipelines. ""It=01,s being pushed=20 basically by the Public Utilities Commission here, which believes that there was collusion"" by=20 pipeline companies to push up gas prices in California, he said.  The CPUC, Campbell suggested, sought satisfaction before the California=20 assembly when it had failed on the federal level: ""There=01,s a concerted effort, not jus= t on=20 natural gas but on other things here in California, for entities and organizations here to point the= =20 finger elsewhere for the problems that we=01,re having in this state and I think you=01,re seein= g some=20 of that with the public utilities commission.""  Whether either report wins over the public incensed by high natural gas=20 prices is a different matter entirely. In the meanwhile, the dueling California market studies se= em=20 to have taken on a life of their own.  The Brattle Group Study, for instance, has become the center of a heavily= =20 litigated effort to force FERC to compel the release of market data by California market=20 participants. Following on a request by SoCal Ed, which said it needed additional data to round out= =20 The Brattle Group report, FERC Chief ALJ Curtis Wagner issued subpoenas to the other three=20 major pipelines that serve the state as well as to Sempra Energy Trading.  Several parties resisted FERC=01,s call for market information, saying the= =20 requested data contained commercially sensitive information. FERC allowed the discovery=20 process to move forward but only after attaching strict data protection rules restricting= =20 access to evidence (GD 4/23).  Critics of the pipeline industry have already suffered one setback in their= =20 case. The commission recently dismissed the CPUC=01,s claim that El Paso rigged the auction of a= =20 large block of pipeline capacity in favor of affiliate El Paso Merchant Energy. In=20 addressing the California Assembly, representatives of Dynegy said that FERC=01,s recent ruling on th= e=20 California border controversy obviated the need for more investigation.  The controversy, however, is far from over. FERC last month also ordered a= =20 hearing into whether El Paso Natural Gas and its affiliates manipulated capacity to driv= e=20 up the price of gas delivered into California (GD 3/29). That hearing is likely to take place= =20 this summer. (RP00- 241, et al.)

(2)? all public utility load serving entities in California must submit  demand bids in real-time markets during all hours.  (3)? all sales by market participants that have been granted authority by the  FERC to sell power at market-based rates are subject to a refund condition to  prevent anti-competitive bids into real time markets.  (4)?? the ISO is required to submit weekly reports to the FERC on scheduled  outages and bid data to facilitate market monitoring.  (5)?? all sales into the ISO real-time market during a period of reserve  deficiency (i.e., during Stage 1, 2 or 3 emergencies) will be subject to  price mitigation.? The FERC order will include a formula that the ISO will be  required to apply for purposes of calculating a proxy price for all such  sales.  The order will also enhance the ISO's ability to coordinate and control  planned outages.   The mitigation plan will be in effect for a one-year period, and will be  subject to periodic review.? The FERC is also requiring the ISO and the  investor-owned utilities to submit a filing by June 1, 2001, to form a  Regional Transmission Organization (RTO).? If an RTO filing is not submitted  by that date, then the market monitoring and mitigation plan will terminate  automatically.? The FERC is also directing the parties to work with RTO West  (an RTO approved for the Pacific Northwest) to develop a plan for including  California within RTO West, with a goal of ultimately creating one RTO for  the entire western interconnection.? Finally, the FERC is instituting an  investigation under Section 206 of the Federal Power Act with respect to  wholesale power sales throughout the western interconnection.? Apparently,  potential refund liability would apply to wholesale power sale transactions  in the western interconnection entered into for a period of 24 hours or less  and made when reserve deficiencies are 7.5% or less.  FERC also approved the formation of RTO West, an eight-state RTO combining  the transmission assets of nine utilities in the Pacific Northwest.? The FERC  asked the RTO to make a submission to it by December 1 of this year on its  plans for including Canadian transmission and widening the scope of its  operations in a broader regional system. RTO West first submitted its plans  to the FERC last October. It includes nine electric utilities serving eight  western states with some 50,000 miles of transmission lines. The nine  utilities include Avista, BPA, Idaho Power, Montana Power, Nevada Power,  PacifiCorp, Portland General Electric, Puget Sound Energy and Sierra Pacific.  The states where the RTO West would operate are Washington, Oregon, Idaho,  Nevada, Utah and parts of Montana, Wyoming and California.

"Larry:  In accordance with our conversation late last week, I am enclosing = a=20 revised draft of the proposed standstill agreement that was discussed on=20 Wednesday.  My comments primarily involve the following:  (1) As you and I discussed last week,  I thought it made sense to specify a= =20 reasonable date by which Enron and PG&E shall have reached closure on a=20 settlement agreement on the contract termination and related claims.  I =20 proposed a one month period to do that.  If the parties can=01,t come to an= =20 agreement in that time period, then the =01&mechanics=018 in the MPA for re= solving=20 a dispute dealing with the calculation of the termination payment would be= =20 =01&reactivated.=018  Obviously, if we are making progress, the parties can=  always=20 extend the date.  I felt it was appropriate to specify the window period to= =20 make sure that everyone is focused on attempting to get a prompt resolution= . =20 Assuming a final settlement agreement is agreed upon, the conditions of the= =20 extension of the =01&stay=018 would be embodied in the settlement agreement=  itself =20 (as opposed to this letter).  (2) Enron agreed at the meeting that it would keep the LCs in place while t= he=20 parties were working to see if a settlement agreement could be reached, and= =20 that requirement is reflected in our revisions to the letter.  Thus, the=20 revised letter provides that Enron will do this for the =01&Initial Extensi= on=20 Period=018 (i.e., to May 25, 2001).  Your draft had provided that Enron wou= ld be=20 required to keep the LCs in place even if no settlement agreement were to b= e=20 reached.  My view is that any requirement to maintain the LCs beyond the=20 Initial Extension Period and any conditions with respect thereto, if agreed= =20 to by Enron, should be part of the final settlement agreement executed by t= he=20 parties, rather than as part of this letter.  Also, we note that, as a=20 contractual matter, the MPA does not require the non-defaulting party to ke= ep=20 in place any security in favor of the defaulting party when, as a result of=  a=20 termination, the non-defaulting party owes a payment to the defaulting part= y.=20  See Sec. 5.5.  (3) Your draft of the letter provided that Enron =01&agrees=018 to enter in= to new=20 master gas agreements and consummate term transactions on =01&commercially= =20 reasonable terms.=018  The revised letter specifies that Enron agrees to=20 negotiate with PG&E in these respects simultaneously with the negotiations= =20 towards a settlement agreement, but any commitment on Enron=01,s part to ef= fect=20 a contract or transaction with PG&E will only arise as a result of the=20 parties=01, execution of the definitive transaction documents (as opposed t= o=20 this letter), the execution of which shall be in the sole discretion of eac= h=20 of the parties.

The agreement, which FERC approved Monday, was in response to a mid-March  order that directed Williams Energy and AES Southland Inc. to show cause why  they shouldn't be found in violation of the Federal Power Act (FPA) for  allegedly engaging in actions that drove up prices in the California bulk  power market and potentially compromised the reliability of the transmission  gid. The two companies entered into the agreement with FERC's Market  Oversight and Enforcement Section to resolve all the issues in the show-cause  order [IN0I-3-001].  Specifically, the agreement calls for Williams to refund $8 million of the  $10.85 million in additional revenues it received when two AES generation  units, designated as reliability must-run (RMR) units, failed to provide  immediate service to the Cal-ISO in April and May. The ISO was forced to call  upon other non-RMR units and pay a much higher price (near or at $750/MWh) to  Williams. Williams is the exclusive marketer for power from the two AES  plants at issue --- AES Alamitos LLC and AES Huntington Beach LLC in Southern  California. The Commission also conditioned Williams' market-based authority  such that it will have to bear the financial cost of replacement power if a  RMR unit is unavailable at any time over the next year.  Significantly, the agreement does not find that either Williams or AES abused  their market power in California. It rejected the California Public Utilities  Commission's request to impose penalties --- over and above refunds --- on  the companies. Moreover, the agreement does not put an end to the ""formal,  non-public investigation"" that FERC ordered in mid-March into violations  arising out of the conduct of Williams and AES.

I was told recently that Carol St Clair was  going to help support the West Trading desk on physical transactions.  Since  she came from the financial legal group I was wondering if she would be able  to help with financial transactions as well.  I feel there are synergies to  having the same Enron lawyer represent us for both the EEI and ISDA.  A  recent example of this could be the SMUD relationship.  Carol recently  completed an amendment to the existing ISDA and now is looking at sending  them a EEI.  The SMUD credit and legal personnel are the same so the process  should be quite smooth.  I was interested in your thoughts on this.  You can  reach me by phone (503-464-3810) or email.  Thanks.

We  need to be certain that Kevin Presto is clear as to the Products and the  risks that we will be taking going forward.  In addition, as we discussed with Consumers this morning, from a scheduling  perspective, we need to be comfortable that the time limits will be as per  Eastern Prevailing Time and not Central Prevailing Time. If we are, then we  need to change the Into Cinergy definition in EEI to address this.   As part of managing this process, as you know my wife is expecting our first  child and with the due date having been passed I am on ""baby alert"" which  could mean me leaving at any minute.

"Dear Elizabeth,  Attached is the Mid-C Call Option Confirmation you reviewed this morning. Many of the changes you suggested were quite valid - thanks for that!  The only modifications that we would prefer not to accept were the ones to ""Delivery Point"" and in the last line of the ""Description of Transaction"". Regarding the former- we would rather not place specific parameters as to how to chose the replacement DP (this goes for all of our counterparties, not just Enron).  Which DP will be similar to the original DP in terms of homogeneity and liquidity to us or to Enron is truly subjective, and furthermore we would not want to agree to stricter parameters with Enron than with other counterparties . The reality is that the parties are likely to disagree on the replacement DP when and if this event occurs, and thus the method for resolving this and any other dispute is arbitration under Section 10.2  of the EEI Master.  Please let me know if the attached revised draft Confirmation will be acceptable to you.

"Elizabeth,  As punishment for ignoring its pleas for price controls, last week the CPUC  issued an order requiring the California IOUs to develop market-based rate  tariffs for their Federal customers, e.g., military installations, federal  agencies.  The CPUC thinks that by exposing the Federal government to current  market prices it will cause Bush/Cheney to rethink price caps.  In any case,  while I think this proposal is unconstitutional under the principles of the  McCulloch v. Maryland case (states can't tax the federal gov.), I also think  there might be a business opportunity here for EPMI in helping Federal  enclaves lock in a fixed price for electricity.  In other words, offer these  Federal entities a fixed-for-floating deal.    Stewart Rosman suggested that the best way to handle this would be to offer  the Federal entities a purely financial deal.  The Federal entities would  continue to receive physical delivery from their utility but could lock in a  fixed rate through a financial swap.  Before we get too far down the road on this, what are your thoughts?  Can the  Federal gov., besides the U.S. Treasury, enter into derivatives contracts?   While financial deals would appear to be superior because they involve less  ongoing work (no physical scheduling or real time support), are there  benefits to a physical transaction?  Any other ideas?  Steve",elizabeth.sager@enron.com,steve.hall@enron.com,Financial vs. physical,2001-05-21 10:04:00-07:00,received

"After a spell of private medical crisis which had the effect of distorting my  professional schedule, I am, for better or worse, back in the professional  saddle.  My private life remains, as always, full of much upheaval, creative  energy and manic playfulness.  My beloved Dona Lisa is going to be fine. The  trip to St. Louis was not meant to be.  Jan got everything cancelled without  any loss of money to Enron shareholders.  I am back in the trenches trying to  get the PacifiCorp EEI done so Harlan can have the pleasure of working  through the big mother of all call options on JUNE 1, your big kickoff date  for living happily ever after.  Hope everything went well with Steve down  there.  I'm looking forward to assessing his reactions to the big E in  Houston. ----cgy",elizabeth.sager@enron.com,christian.yoder@enron.com,back in saddle,2001-05-31 04:26:00-07:00,received

"Elizabeth:  Not to add to your woes, but I am forwarding an e-mail from  Michael re: SoCalEd which, as you know, could go the same route as PG&E in  the not too distant future in light of the fact that its MOU with the State  is not going anywhere.  We probably need to revisit our SCE exposures,  including seeing whether we can get a better handle on what we may have  running through the PX and ISO and any update on the ""commandeered"" contract  (under which, I presume, we are still obligated to sell to CDWR (if I  remember correctly the chain of events)). Also, we probably need to start  thinking about extending the standstill letter with PG&E and dealing with  renewing the LOCs on the EPMI power termination payment liability?  I have  not heard anything on the PG&E front in this respect this week in terms of  whether any further ""settlement"" talks have taken place.  Give me a call  whenever you come up for air.

"FROM: Mark Whitney, TheLaw.net Corporation HOMEPAGE: http://www.thelaw.net REMOVE: http://www.thelaw.net/remove.htm       Legal research often comes in waves, but as night follows day, that  onerous monthly commitment to West or Lexis is always there. But with so many  new options, it doesn't have to be this way.   --VIABLE ALTERNATIVES ABOUND       True though it may be that your West or Lexis rep is out to put you on  that fat annual contract, both companies offer a variety of online  alternatives. A person can:  ----log in and buy most any document for a few bucks ----Shepardize or Keycite for around $4 ----subscribe to KeyCite for $35 a month ----rent a state for a week for $40 ----conduct transaction based case law searches only when you have to ----Supreme Court case law from 1790 is now available on the web for FREE ----California state case law from 1934 is now available on the web for FREE ----the landscape continues to change rapidly   --CHOOSE THE RIGHT TOOL FOR THE JOB       There can be no question that the commercial value of proprietary legal  research resources will continue to drop as more and more primary and  secondary materials migrate online. At TheLaw.net Corporation we advocate  choosing the right tool for the job. And one of the best single tools you can  own these days is our flagship software solution, TheLaw.net Professional  Legal Browser.   --LESS THAN $1 A DAY FOR EVERYTHING, UNLIMITED ACCESS       For just $395 annually for an individual, TheLaw.net gives you a  remarkable foundation of primary and secondary resources, on an unlimited use  basis, with a national scope, including, but certainly not limited to, the  following:  ----A great proprietary, searchable case law database that includes the U.S.  Supreme Court, the 13 Federal circuits, the 50 state supreme courts and  intermediate appellate courts. See, http://www.thelaw.net/caselawgrid.htm  ----Literally millions of searchable cases, updated four times daily, offered  on an unlimited use basis  ----Streamlined access to: ------Federal and state statutes, rules and regulations ------the CFR and Federal Register ------executive agency databases and bill trackers ------nearly 1,000 news resources ------another 1,000 reference desk tools ------nearly 10,000 practice area helpers and much, much more ------over 50,000 documents and databases ------all just a fast click or two away on your desktop 24 - 7 - 365   --THELAW.NET MAY OR MAY NOT BE ALL YOU NEED       Depending on size, practice area and/or jurisdiction, TheLaw.net may  well have everything you need. If not, West and Lexis are available online, a  la carte for those times when you really need them. As an example, TheLaw.net  is not yet a great resource for Federal District Court opinions.       It all depends on what you want your life to look like. If the  convenience and elegance of the gold standard is worth the rates charged by  the legal research cartel, you should keep doing what you've been doing and  renew that annual contract with Company A or Company B. If not, and you feel  like you continue to get hammered at a time when given the efficiencies of  computerized distribution of data, prices ought to be dropping, we can help.

"So great is the humor about all this WSPP stuff and the tennis backdrop that  I would be willing to ""come out of retirement"" and enter the doubles combat  zone.  The thought of Clyde Durham, itinerant journeyman, former Bible School  doubles player from Kansas, striding on to the court to do battle with that  little runt of a MIke Small,  this fuels my competitive imagination to the  point of red hot coals.    I need to go see my cousin in Boulder and could  work something in around this event.

I've learned....That the best classroom in the world is at the feet of an elderly person.  I've learned....That when you're in love, it shows.  I've learned....That just one person saying to me, ""You've made my day!"" makes my day.  I've learned....That having a child fall asleep in your arms is one of the most peaceful feelings in the world.  I've learned....That being kind is more important than being right.  I've learned....That you should never say no to a gift from a child.  I've learned....That I can always pray for someone when I don't have the strength to help him in some other way.  I've learned....That no matter how serious your life requires you to be, everyone needs a friend to act goofy with.  I've learned....That sometimes all a person needs is a hand to hold and a heart to understand.  I've learned....That simple walks with my father around the block on summer nights when I was a child did wonders for me as an adult.  I've learned....That life is like a roll of toilet paper. The closer it gets to the end, the faster it goes.  I've learned....That we should be glad God doesn't give us everything we ask for.  I've learned....That money doesn't buy class.  I've learned....That it's those small daily happenings that make life so spectacular.  I've learned...That under everyone's hard shell is someone who wants to be appreciated and loved.  I've learned....That the Lord didn't do it all in one day. What makes me think I can?  I've learned.... That to ignore the facts does not change the facts.  I've learned....That when you plan to get even with someone, you are only letting that person continue to hurt you.  I've learned....That love, not time, heals all wounds.  I've learned....That the easiest way for me to grow as a person is to surround myself with people smarter than I am.  I've learned....That everyone you meet deserves to be greeted with a smile.  I've learned....That there's nothing sweeter than sleeping with your babies and feeling their breath on your cheeks.  I've learned....That no one is perfect until you fall in love with them.  I've learned....That life is tough, but I'm tougher.  I've learned....That opportunities are never lost; someone will take the ones you miss.  I've learned....That when you harbor bitterness, happiness will dock elsewhere.  I've learned....That I wish I could have told my Mom that I love her one more time before she passed away.  I've learned....That one should keep his words both soft and tender because tomorrow he may have to eat them.  I've learned....That a smile is an inexpensive way to improve your looks.  I've learned....That I can't choose how I feel, but I can choose what I do about it.  I've learned....That when your newly born grandchild holds your little finger in his little fist, that you're hooked for life.  I've learned....That everyone wants to live on top of the mountain, but all the happiness and growth occurs while you're climbing it.  I've learned....That it is best to give advice in only two circumstances; when it is requested and when it is a life threatening situation.  I've learned....That the less time I have to work with, the more things I get done.  I've learned....Friends are very rare jewels, indeed.  They make you smile and encourage you to succeed.  They lend an ear, they share words of praise and they always want to open their hearts to us.   It's National Friendship Week. Show your friends how much you care.  Send this to everyone you consider a FRIEND, even if it means sending it back to the person who sent it to you.  If it comes back to you, then you'll know you have a circle of friends.

My first reaction was:  why does Enron have to analyze them?   He is apparently part of a working committee of some sort that is advising the government.  These are the contracts that Davis has held on to so long, but is now releasing, and which will show that he bought high priced power and locked it in for long terms.  Jeff says he is in a room with a bunch of idiots who know nothing about contracts and they are all asking questions about the ""out clauses.""  He wants us to tell him what the ""out clauses"" are all about.  Enron never signed a long term deal, so I am wondering what, besides a kind of bizarre curiousity, would have us in that room down there trying to help a bunch of hysterical bureaucrats paw through a foot of legal paper.

We understand that EOL requires that a counter party, before accessing E= OL to do business with Enron North America, must undergo a credit worthines= s evaluation.   When a counter party executes or clicks on a price, EOL doe= s an instant credit check before confirming the transaction. However, Enron may not only buy from a counter party, it may sell.  What so= rt of creditworthiness standards must Enron provide to a counter party util= izing EOL to purchase from Enron? Are there industry standard creditworthiness agreements regarding counter p= arty credit risk that Enron uses?  If yes, may we have copies?  If Enron ut= ilizes its own agreements, please provide us with a copy.  All counterparties are assessed by our credit department prior to any trans= action being entered into by Enron whether the transaction is being conduct= ed over the phone or through EnronOnline.  Enron, as the principal to all p= urchases and sales on EnronOnline and when completing transactions on the t= elephone or in writing, requires counterparties to be creditworthy.  In add= ition, Enron's risk management process is required to be approved by the En= ron Board of Directors, according to Securities Exchange Act regulations as=  a publicly held company.  Enron's risk policies are provided in Enron's pu= blicly available [[10-Q??]]_______ audited financial statements filed on a = quarterly and annual basis with the SEC.  Enron maintains a separate risk m= anagement group that has oversight over all transactions done by all Enron = trading units and that ensures compliance with the risk management policies= .  This group has a separate reporting line directly to the office of the C= hairman of Enron Corp. and has the authority to instruct the suspension of = transactions in order to ensure that trading limits are not exceeded.  In a= ddition, every counterparty of Enron has to clear a credit check before the= y can transact through EnronOnline.  The Credit Risk Management group appro= ves a counterparty for a specific credit limit and tenor limit which are em= bedded within the EnronOnline database.    Every transaction is passed thro= ugh an electronic credit check to assure that the credit limits and tenor l= imits are not violated prior to Enron accepting the counterparty's bid or o= ffer via EnronOnline, such credit checks are done automatically and there i= s no human intervention.  As with all Enron transactions, the credit limit = checks utilize a potential exposure calculation to take into account future=  price volatility.  The Credit Risk Management group monitors transaction f= low on all Enron transactions including EnronOnline continually.   EnronOnl= ine does provide CRM with electronic alerts when customers approach credit = limits or breach credit limits.  No further transactions are executed unles= s CRM is sufficiently satisfied that the credit position has been mitigated=  such that credit limit is still available.  EnronOnline uses the same credit policy as other transactions Enron enters = into, whether we are buying or selling.  The transactions entered into on E= nronOnline are all governed by either a Master Agreement or the General Ter= ms and Conditions (which are a shorter form of contract and differ for each=  commodity, these are all available on the web-site).  A Master Agreement i= s negotiated with the Counterparty offline and includes negotiated bilatera= l credit terms and these terms govern any transactions entered into on Enro= nOnline.  The General Terms and Conditions which will apply to EnronOnline = transactions if there is no Master Agreement in place between Enron and the=  counterparty include industry standard credit requirements which the count= erparty chooses to accept or not online, should the counterparty not want t= o accept to language in the contract (for credit or other reasons), the Hel= pdesk for EnronOnline will facilitate contact between the Enron Credit grou= p or Enron Legal group with the counterparty allowing the Counterparty to n= egotiate terms which may be more appropriate to them.  Question 2:    I understood Dave Forster to state that EOL does not collect=  data regarding where a customer's mouse is moving on the system.  However,=  does EOL require customers to have cookies enabled?   If yes, does EOL col= lect, use or manage data regarding cookies?  It is correct that Enron does not collect data regarding where a customer's=  mouse is moving on the system.  It is also correct to note that we have no=  capability of knowing where the customer's mouse is. =20  EnronOnline does not require customers to have cookies enabled. =20  Question 3:=09Also, why doesn't EOL publish a ""ticker"" of completed trades = showing prices and quantities?  Does EOL have any plans to start publishing=  such data?  If yes, when?  There are now several options for viewing historical pricing/transaction da= ta from EnronOnline.  Reuters recently began showing quotes from EnronOnlin= e (http://about.reuters.com/enrononlinequotes/), which also provides custom= ers with the ability to reference historical prices from the date at which = they acquire access.  In addition, EnronOnline provides a number of online = charts for products, which graphically depict historical transaction prices= .  Customers can also run reports to see their own transactions and downloa= d the results into an Excel spreadsheet on EnronOnline  The system also all= ows for administrative users, thereby allowing the back offices of counterp= arties to monitor the trading activity and deal with it appropriately in li= ne with their own systems.  Enron does not publish transactions completed via EnronOnline however Enron=  will provide information on such transactions in order to ensure market ac= tivity is being correctly reflected in the approriate market indices. For e= xample, Enron does provide EnronOnline transaction data to the Natural Gas = Exchange in Calgary in order to ensure that indices produced by Canadian En= erdata accuately reflect the activity in the market place (this will commen= ce on July 1, 2001).  At the end of each day, EnronOnline makes available t= o all customers through EnronOnline the weighted average price of that day'= s transactions.  The data associated with US Natural Gas is sent in this fo= rmat to Gas Daily for inclusion in their automated exchange index.  Question 4: =09In addition, how does the data collection from EOL/Enron Net= works flow to the risk management groups?  How is the information used?  EnronOnline transactions are sent to different risk management groups depen= ding on the type of commodity transacted.  For example, the group that hand= les U.S. gas settlements is not the same group as the one handling Australi= an Power.  The transactions are transmitted to the appropriate back office = utilizing a ""bridge"":  a process that is capable of communicating transacti= on information into the variety of systems that Enron operates. The potenti= al for manual input error is thereby removed providing Enron and the custom= er with more efficient recording of the transaction. The back office system= s at Enron use transaction information as an input into various functions, = such as invoicing, preparation of financial statements, risk management and=  credit.  These back office systems are used to track transactions from all=  sources, including EnronOnline, the telephone, other trading systems, etc.=   Information is maintained on these systems according to accounting and re= gulatory rules, regardless of the source of the transaction.  The Enron commercial employee, who is offering to buy or to sell through En= ronOnline, does so through a price management software application, this no= tifies him immediately that a transaction is completed.  The counterparty, = the Enron commercial employee and the risk management groups are all notifi= ed by the system at the same time. =20  The data from an EnronOnline transaction is used in exactly the same way as=  information is used from any transaction completed by Enron. When a transa= ction is completed, EnronOnline serves purely as a deal capture system that=  captures the data necessary to feed to our risk management system.  Enron = Online does not feed settlement systems or credit systems.  It does, howeve= r, automate our deal capture system, which improves the data feeds to our s= ettlement and credit systems.  Question 5:=09Also, we assume that data regarding each trade is maintained = by EOL.  If yes, in what form and for how long?  EnronOnline transactions are captured in the EnronOnline database.  The tra= nsactions are 'bridged' (duplicated) onto the various systems (databases) m= anaging the underlying commodity (the risk system associated with the commo= dity).  We currently intend to store the data for a period of six years pos= t a transaction completing (for example, deliveries finishing) and this is = policy across all databases.  In general, EnronOnline is an electronic trading platform that offers free,=  real-time pricing information for approximately 1,800 products for 13 comm= odities, including electricity and natural gas.  EnronOnline utilizes e-com= merce and Internet technology to conduct trading business that previously t= ook place on the telephone and by fax.   EnronOnline is a proprietary, or ""= one-to-many"" trading platform. On a ""one-to-many"" platform, one entity, suc= h as Enron, is the principal to every trade (unlike a ""broker"" type platfor= m). =20  EnronOnline allows buyers and sellers to act on prices that can change by t= he second.  Buyers or sellers can also see real-time price spreads of both = the sell price and the buy price.  For example, on the telephone, a buyer p= reviously would call to ask about gas prices for each of the next six month= s, but by the time the trader finished reciting the prices, some prices cou= ld have changed.

"Hi Chris  1.  We don't have a ""one off form"" for US power trading, but it may be possible to use the US GTCs (3 pages) - this document contemplates multiple trades but is shorter than EEI.  It however does not define INTO products, and in general EEI is much better and longer.  Credit usually insists on using EEI w full blown credit and product definitions.  2. Success always comes at a price - great job winning out the financial vs. physical debate.  (ps you may think the pain is over but ... in the US, meetings continue in August to finalize collateral annex and new products. oh boy).  Hope all is good and Addy is doing well.

One of our originators has been talking to a Canadian counterparty that wants to do a one-off term (3 year) purchase and sale transaction ""into Entergy"".  Would they need to put an EEI form in place or is there another document they could use for a one time transaction.  The customer is a pulp, paper and forestry products company.     2.  We expect to release a form of EEI master in Toronto later this week.  With the warm weather and the 8 month process I have had to not only act as draftsman, but also meeting organizer, communications coordinator, and a number of other roles that have been extremely satisfying.

"Elizabeth and Mark,  it may also be useful to look at this suggested alternative.  Again, we do not have any agenda in terms of which is the ""right"" method, but we are just trying to figure out what works in the bandwidth context.  All thoughts gratefully received.   -----Original Message----- From:  Traung, Peter   Sent: 12 July 2001 19:12 To: Harkness, Cynthia Cc: Browning, Mary Nell Subject: Section 5.4 of the new draft MSA  Cynthia, subject to further amendment this is what we're planning to use instead of the structure in the June 22 draft:  (i) If an Early Termination Date is designated, the Defaulting Party shall compensate the Non-Defaulting Party for the Loss, if any, caused the Non-Defaulting Party with respect to each Terminated Product.  The amount of a Loss shall be determined by reference to (i) the prices available within [thirty (30)] Business Days after the Early Termination Date in an arm's length transaction for a replacement product, or (ii) the price agreed in a cover transaction effected within [thirty (30)] Business Days after the Early Termination Date.  No actual purchase or sale shall be required in order to determine a Loss.  Any cover transaction shall be effected in a reasonable manner and on the best available terms.  In no event shall the Non-Defaulting Party be required to use its own market position in order to effect a cover transaction.          (ii) If the Non-Defaulting Party has suffered Loss, the sum of such Loss shall be payable to the Non-Defaulting Party by the Defaulting Party on the date specified in Section 5.5.  The amount payable by a Party pursuant to this Section 5.4(ii) shall be the ""Termination Payment"".  ""Loss"" means an amount equal to the difference between the present value of the Contract Price for the remaining Term and the present value of the cost for a replacement product.  With respect to the Buyer, a Loss shall have occurred if such replacement cost is higher than the Contract Price for the remaining Term.  With respect to the Seller, a Loss shall have occurred if such replacement cost is lower than the Contract Price for the remaining Term.   This takes the place of the present 5.4(i)-(ii), and the definition of Gain is deleted.

HOUSTON -(Dow Jones)- An executive descri= bed as ""a seasoned trader"" will lead Enron Corp.'s (ENE) telecommunications=  unit after its current chief executive takes a different position within c= orporation in the next two weeks. James Fallon, president and chief operati= ng officer, will lead Enron Broadband Services after it becomes part of Enr= on's Wholesale Services Group.   Broadband Services Senior Vice President K= elly Kimberly told Dow Jones Newswires Fallon will lead the organization af= ter Kenneth Rice, chairman and chief executive, moves to a corporate job at=  Enron.   Fallon was unavailable to talk to Dow Jones for this story.   One=  broker said Fallon's selection indicated Enron isn't backing away from dev= eloping the bandwidth market.   ""Jim Fallon is a seasoned trader,"" the brok= er said. ""He made a killing in the power markets. He has a huge reputation = for making money.""   The broker speculated that Fallon may increase the num= ber of traders Enron has in the bandwidth market. Broadband Services has an= nounced plans to reassign and possibly layoff non-trader employees in the c= oming two weeks.   An analyst said Fallon's appointment indicates future gr= owth for Enron's bandwidth business.   ""I think Fallon is someone who would= n't be there if it isn't a good opportunity,"" said Raymond Niles, director = of power and merchant energy research with Salomon Smith Barney.   In his n= ew role, Fallon will report to Mark Frevert, chairman and chief executive o= f Enron Wholesale Services, and Greg Whalley, president and chief operating=  officer of Wholesale Services.   Rice previously reported to Kenneth Lay, = corporate chairman and chief executive.   Before becoming president of Broa= dband Services, Fallon was managing director of global trading and risk man= agement for the unit.   From 1993 to 1999, he worked in Enron North America= 's wholesale energy business rising from the position of associate to manag= ing director, leading the power trading business.   Before coming to Enron,=  Fallon was a nuclear operations engineer for General Electric, a systems e= ngineer at W.R. Grace and a certified public accountant for Price Waterhous= e.   Fallon earned a bachelor's degree in marine engineering from the Massa= chusetts Maritime Academy, a master's degree in accounting from Northeaster= n University and a master's in business administration from Columbia Univer= sity.   Fallon takes over a unit that lost $102 million in the second quart= er of this year and is going through a restructuring to reduce losses at th= e same time bandwidth prices continue to plummet.   -By Erwin Seba, Dow Jon= es Newswires; 713-547-9214; erwin.seba@dowjones.com <mailto:erwin.seba@dowj= ones.com>   NRG0119800084 =09   ","harlan.murphy@enron.com, carol.st.@enron.com",elizabeth.sager@enron.com,FW: trading bandwidth,2001-07-18 14:04:11-07:00,sent

I think at this point we agree that allowing read only access to the templates is not beneficial for both groups.  However, we would recommend that legal at least periodically review the templates (semi-annually or annually) to ensure the confirmations are proper.  In addition, as an additional step, have the deal clearing group attach the approval by legal to those confirmations that require modifications so that an audit trail exists.

As our mass market retail contracts for Enron Direct Canada are much more unilateral in our favour, as this is more acceptable and consistent in this market segment, the existing set-off language in those forms provides broad rectangular set-off only in our favour.  My inclination is to leave it that way for these forms unless you think otherwise.  Peter.   -----Original Message----- From:  Crawford, Sharon   Sent: Thursday, July 19, 2001 11:46 AM To: Keohane, Peter Subject: Mandatory Setoff Language  SENT ON BEHALF OF DEREK FLAMAN:  Further to our meeting on July 17, I have reviewed both the new mandatory setoff language as set forth in Mark Haedicke's memo dated July 12, 2001 (the ""New Setoff Language"") and the setoff language contained in the Enron Direct retail forms (the ""Retail Setoff Language"").  The following are the most notable differences between the two:  1. The New Setoff Language is drafted for ""triangular"" setoff purposes.  The Retail Setoff Language is drafted for ""rectangular"" cross-affiliate setoff; as such, Enron Direct may setoff any amounts owed by Enron Direct or any of its affiliates to counterparty or any of counterparty's affiliates against any amounts owed to Enron Direct or any of its affiliates by counterparty or any of counterparty's affiliates.  2. The New Setoff Language provides the non-defaulting party with the right of setoff - note that the non-defaulting party could be either an Enron entity or counterparty.  The Retail Setoff Language provides only Enron Direct with the right of setoff - counterparty has no setoff rights.  Given that:  (a) the aforementioned differences are beneficial to Enron/Enron Direct, and (b) my understanding is that such differences are generally palatable to counterparties in the retail industry, please advise whether the New Setoff Language should be inputted into the Enron Direct retail forms.

Cathy  Revised Public Utility Filing Requirements, RM01-8-000  ACTION:  Notice of Proposed Rulemaking. SUMMARY:  The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (Commission) recognizes = that the filing of individual service agreements and paper copies of quarte= rly market-based sales of electric energy is no longer the most effective m= eans of meeting the requirements of the Federal Power Act (FPA).  Instead, = this data must be collected and made publicly available in a manner which i= s both easily accessible and useful to the public.  To this end, the Commis= sion proposes that each public utility under the FPA (public utility) would=  no longer file:  short-term or long-term service agreements for market-bas= ed sales of electric energy; service agreements for those generally applica= ble services, such as point-to-point transmission service, for which the pu= blic utility has a standard form of agreement under its tariff; and Quarter= ly Transaction Reports summarizing its short-term sales and purchases of po= wer at market-based rates.  In lieu of the above listed filings, each publi= c utility would file electronically with the Commission and post on its web= site an Index of Customers that contains a summary of the contractual terms=  and conditions in its service agreements for all jurisdictional services (= market-based power sales, cost-based power sales, and transmission service)= ; and transaction information for its short-term and long-term market-based=  power sales and cost-based power sales during the most recent calendar qua= rter.  Under the proposals in this NOPR, to the extent a public utility wis= hes to avoid filing service agreements for generally applicable services su= ch as cost-based power sales or interconnection agreements, it would revise=  its tariff to include standard forms of service agreements for those servi= ces.  The NOPR also proposes to delete 18 CFR ?2.8, concerning the simplifi= cation of public utility rate schedule filings, as no longer necessary.   =3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D= =3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D= =3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D= =3D=3D=3D This e-mail, including attachments, contains information that is confidenti= al and may be protected by the attorney/client or other privileges.

I had two other questions that you might help us with.  Sent to legal (deal 702644.01, 700154.01) EOL and non EOL deal, Enron states: Firm (LD) Energy  Reliant is striking through and placing firm (ld) Energy in lowercase.   [Portz, David]  I think Genia has already allocated these to another attorney(s) in the group, or if she hasn't already, will.   I think it matters which Reliant affiliate you are speaking of, because we only have the EEI in effect with one of them, and ""Firm (LD)"" is a defined product type under the EEI.    Also on our West trades, Product:  West Firm Energy Reliant is adding service schedule C. [Portz, David]   I am requesting that Genia Fitzgerald designate an attorney who will help you with this.   I can refax the above confirmations for your review if needed.  NRG Power Marketing:  The past trades that have not been signed by the counterparty, are those considered executed now that we have an EEI agreement?   Does it cover the additional language in confirmations such as SP 15, NP 15, Nepool language? [Portz, David]    Past trades brought under the EEI Master were referenced on an Attachment A to the EEI Master dated effective June 29th 2001, prepared by Rhonda in coordination with NRG.  As such, the commercial terms of those confirms (corresponding with the numbers on the Attachment A spreadsheet) have clearly been affirmed in writing by the parties; price has not been specifically affirmed in writing however, and the remaining confirmation boilerplate is intended by the parties to be superseded by the EEI Master's terms.  It would thus seem advisable to reconfirm any currently outstanding trades on using the format(s) of EEI confirmation agreed betweent he parties.    The specific language re SP 15, NP 15, & Nepool would remain in effect as to the underlying trades  --  the EEI Master's text does not treat those matters anyway.    Thanks for your help!

You may recall that a while back I encouraged Gov't & Regulatory affairs to withdraw a complaint they had filed with FERC to suspend the ISO's underscheduling penalty.  I asked them to withdraw it because the CAISO Tariff said that the ISO would pay the penalty to Scheduling Coordinators that correctly scheduled load and did not incur the penalty (read Enron).  To make a long story short, Enron withdrew its complaint and FERC ordered that the ISO continue to impose the penalty for the time being.  We just received word today that the ISO is crediting us with approximately $30 million in underscheduling payments.  Although with the defaults we may not get full payment, perhaps we can use this as a bargaining chip/offset with California if we have to make refund payments to the ISO.

I have already had several meetings with the desk heads and Elizabeth Sager on this very issue and work has begun.   This is a huge industry issue given the changing RTO landscape and its potential effects on the traditional ""into"" product.   Until there is clarity on the RTO market structure and transmission rights, there is simply not language that we can get comfortable with.  Rather than blame the traders and/or legal for transaction difficulty, why not immerse yourself into the MISO and Alliance documents and find potential opportunities.   Learn the difference between LMP and ""into"". What are the congestion areas in the Midwest.   What will the basis markets look like?   What is a basis market?What generation units will benefit from LMP/zonal pricing?   What generation will get hurt by congestion?    With regulatory change lies opportunity for marketing transactions.   The fact of the matter is a 2003-06 Into-Cinergy trade (long or short) contains significant regulatory risk, and to protect Enron's shareholders, we need to price addition premium or don't do the trade at all.   On the other hand, getting long at a plant bus-bar in a bullish LMP location and getting short LMP seller's choice would be a good trade.   These are the types of transactions the marketing group should be thinking about.   Take advantage of the changing regulatory landscape, don't use it as a crux.   I look forward to discussing with you on Monday morning.  -----Original Message-----  From: Dalton III, Oscar  Sent: Fri 8/3/2001 4:46 PM  To: Sager, Elizabeth  Cc: Baughman, Edward D.; Presto, Kevin M.; Clynes, Terri; Sturm, Fletcher J.; Davis, Dana  Subject: RTO Development and impact to Commercial Transactions       I am requesting that the Legal Department draft and approve specific language that the Mid-Marketing groups can utilize in proposals and subsequent contracts to address the issue of RTO development and the impact on the risk profiles of our commercial transactions.

I hope to have our comments on the form by the end of the week.  Hopefully we can then settle on a form and proceed for use with counterparties, such as Engage, etc.  One specific issue, however, is the incorporation of the type of set-off language that has been recently proposed by the Legal Trading Committee and, in particular, the use of ""triangular"" set-off.  The Legal Trading Committee agreed to restrict the set-off rights of the non-defaulting party to ""triangular"" set-off for two reasons:  1. ""rectangular"" set-off would be stretching the privity/enforceability issue where the non-defaulting party's affiliates were not a party to the master agreement; and  2. ""rectangular"" set-off could be stretching commercial acceptability with counterparties.  However, in the structure of a master netting, set-off and collateral agreement, I believe both these issues go away, and I think that ""rectangular"" set-off is in fact consistent with the arrangement.  Firstly, unlike a master trading agreement, under the master netting agreement both the non-defaulting party and the non-defaulting party's affiliates, as well as the defaulting party and the defaulting party's affiliates, all should be parties to the agreement, therefore addressing the privity issue.  Secondly, in terms of commercial acceptability, by definition I believe that the parties are agreeing to an omnibus relationship for setting off positions and collateral requirements across all product lines with all trading affiliates.  Please let me have your thoughts.

Emshwiller  08/16/2001  The Wall Street Journal  Page A2  (Co= pyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)  Jeffrey K. Skilling said that=  the pressure he felt from Enron Corp.'s plummeting stock price was the mai= n reason he decided to resign Tuesday as the energy giant's chief executive=  officer after only about six months in the job.  In an interview yesterday= , the 47-year-old Mr. Skilling elaborated on his decision to leave Houston-= based Enron. On Tuesday, Mr. Skilling insisted he had resigned for ""persona= l reasons"" unrelated to Enron's business activities.  In the interview, he = reiterated that he wasn't under any pressure to resign from the company's b= oard or Chairman Kenneth Lay, who has resumed the CEO's duties at the natio= n's biggest energy trader.  However, yesterday Mr. Skilling said that his ""= personal reasons"" were deeply enmeshed with feelings that he had failed in = a crucial business area during his brief tenure as CEO. Calling the company= 's stock performance a ""kind of ultimate score card,"" Mr. Skilling noted th= at Enron's share price had fallen by some 50% this year.  Mr. Skilling said=  he took that stock-price drop very personally. ""I put a lot of pressure on=  myself"" for that decline, he said. ""I felt I must not be communicating wel= l enough"" with investors. He felt this particularly given Enron's strong fi= nancial results over the past several quarters, based largely on growing vo= lumes in its trading business, which covers a range of items, including ele= ctricity, pulp and paper.  If the stock price had remained up ""I don't thin= k I would have felt the pressure to leave,"" he said.  In January, Enron top= ped $84 a share in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. It closed Tue= sday, before the announcement of Mr. Skilling's resignation, at $42.93 a sh= are. As of 4 p.m. yesterday, Enron traded at $40.25, after falling below $3= 7 during the day.  Mr. Skilling, who had been at Enron 11 years, said the d= epressed stock price was particularly tough to explain to fellow Enron empl= oyees, many of whom are shareholders. ""People would say `What is going on w= ith the stock, Jeff?' I would have to say I didn't know. It has been frustr= ating,"" said Mr. Skilling.  The self-portrait offered by Mr. Skilling in th= e interview is rather different from the widely held image of him as an amb= itious, bright and thick-skinned business strategist whose long-held goal h= ad been becoming Enron CEO. Mr. Skilling said that the ""final straw"" in his=  decision to leave had come on a visit last week to England in connection w= ith the deaths of three Enron workers in a power-plant accident there. That=  trip helped reinforce ""how tenuous life is,"" said Mr. Skilling, who has th= ree children from a previous marriage and recently became engaged.  While M= r. Skilling said Enron is in ""great shape,"" his departure raised anxiety in=  the investment community. Merrill Lynch, for instance, lowered its rating = on Enron to neutral from buy based on ""uncertainty"" created by the resignat= ion.  Yesterday, an Enron spokesman confirmed that Mr. Lay plans to name tw= o executives to the existing ""office of the chairman"" within the next few d= ays or weeks. The spokesman said Mr. Lay hadn't yet revealed whom the two w= ould be. The office of the chairman had consisted of Mr. Lay and Mr. Skilli= ng. =09  Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Its good reading.  -Kit  Published Thursday, August 16, 2001    Group questions power payments POWER CRISIS  By Mike Taugher CONTRA COSTA TIMES    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------   An industry trade group asked market officials on Wednesday why they have failed to pay more than $1 billion for power sold during April and May.  ""For some reason, the money is not getting from the ratepayers to the generators,"" said Jan Smutny-Jones, director of the Independent Energy Producers Association. ""Our hope is that this is a temporary misunderstanding.""  Part of the answer, officials said, is that the state's power-buying agency is refusing to pay its bills in full until it gets more information about who ultimately receives the cash.  Compounding the problem is the fact that when the May bills began coming due earlier this month, some market participants who were owed money from previous months credited their own accounts instead of paying in full, according to the Independent System Operator.  That left the ISO less able to pay its May bills, said ISO President and CEO Terry Winter in a written statement.  ""The ISO acknowledges that past debt is due,"" Winter said in the statement.  Winter said the ISO would respond more fully to address questions about the underpayments by Friday. But in response to the IEP letter, he demanded that market participants quit crediting their own bills.  The ISO runs the spot markets in California. Buyers and sellers make their bids through the ISO, which sets the market price based on those bids, collects payments from the buyers and divvies them up to the sellers.   The issue came to a head Wednesday when the IEP sent a letter to the ISO, demanding to know why generators were not paid in full for electricity sold in April and May. Smutny-Jones said estimates of unpaid amounts during that period ranged around $1.2 billion.  In early April, federal regulations went into effect that essentially barred the financially broke utilities from buying power in the ISO market. That forced the state Department of Water Resources, which began buying electricity in January, to pick up the entire unmet need of the utilities' customers.  DWR spokesman Oscar Hidalgo said that the state is required to compile certain information about bills it pays before it pays them.   ""We haven't been given what we feel is an adequate accounting of what we're going to be paid for,"" Hidalgo said. ""We are working with the ISO to see how we can get some of that information that we're not getting.""  ISO spokesman Gregg Fishman said his agency is working with the water department, but that market tariffs require that some information be kept confidential.  ""We can't tell one market participant what another market participant is doing,"" Fishman said.          -----Original Message----- From: Hall, Steve C.

This is par= ticularly true as our trading business is expanding to include numerous com= modity lines, including gas, power, coal, steel, pulp and paper, each of wh= ich may be traded under different masters with a single counterparty.  This=  complexity is further increased as a result of EWS using multiple affiliat= ed entities to trade the various commodities.  Absent express contractual s= etoff rights, EWS may be unable to setoff exposures under different master = contracts.  =09A team of EWS lawyers has been working to assemble setoff language that = will substantially enhance EWS's credit position with counterparties with w= hom we trade multiple commodities.  This setoff language, which is set fort= h below, must be in all EWS trading form contracts.  Similarly, when negoti= ating on third party paper, we should request that this additional setoff l= anguage be added.   MANDATORY SETOFF LANGUAGE FOR=20 EWS TRADING CONTRACTS  =09(A) Upon the designation or deemed designation of an Early Termination D= ate, the Non-Defaulting Party (""X"") may, at its option and in its discretio= n, setoff, against any amounts Owed to the Defaulting Party (""Y"") by X or a= ny Affiliate of X under this Agreement or under any other agreement(s), ins= trument(s) or undertaking(s), any amounts Owed by Y to X or any of X's Affi= liates under this Agreement or under any other agreement(s), instrument(s) = or undertaking(s).  The obligations of Y and X under this Agreement in resp= ect of such amounts shall be deemed satisfied and discharged to the extent = of any such setoff exercised by X and/or X's Affiliates.  X will give Y not= ice of any setoff effected under this section as soon as practicable after = the setoff is effected provided that failure to give such notice shall not = affect the validity of the setoff.  For purposes of this Section __, ""Owed""=  shall mean any amounts owed or otherwise accrued and payable (regardless o= f whether such amounts have been or could be invoiced) as of the Early Term= ination Date.  =09  =09Amounts subject to the setoff permitted in this Section __ may be conver= ted by X into any currency in which any obligation Owed is denominated at t= he rate of exchange at which X, acting in a reasonable manner and in good f= aith, would be able to purchase the relevant amount of the currency being c= onverted. If an obligation is unascertained, X may in good faith estimate t= hat obligation and setoff in respect of the estimate, subject to the releva= nt party accounting to the other when the obligation is ascertained.  Nothi= ng in this Section __shall be effective to create a charge or other securit= y interest except as may be provided under applicable law.   This setoff pr= ovision shall be without prejudice and in addition to any right of setoff, = netting, off-set, combination of accounts, counterclaim, lien or other righ= t to which any party is at any time otherwise entitled (whether by operatio= n of law, contract or otherwise).  Each of the parties represent and acknow= ledge that the rights set forth in this Section __ are an integral part of = the agreement between the parties and that without such rights the parties = would not be willing to enter into Transactions.  The parties further ackno= wledge that each is executing this Agreement on behalf of itself as princip= al and, with respect to this Section ___, as agent on behalf of its Affilia= tes, which Affiliates shall receive the benefits of this Section __ and oth= erwise be bound as if such Affiliates had directly signed this Agreement as=  it relates to Section ___.  =09(B) Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained in this Agre= ement, the Non-Defaulting Party shall not be required to pay to the Default= ing Party any amount under Section __ until the Non-Defaulting Party receiv= es confirmation satisfactory to it in its reasonable discretion (which may = include an opinion of its counsel) that all other obligations of any kind w= hatsoever of the Defaulting Party to make any payments to the Non-Defaultin= g Party or any of its Affiliates under this Agreement or under any other ag= reement(s), instrument(s) or undertaking(s), which are Owed as of the Early=  Termination Date have been fully and finally satisfied.  =09This new setoff language will provide EWS the right to setoff amounts du= e and owing as of the Early Termination Date (but does not include future p= ayments) between the counterparty and EWS and its affiliates (triangular se= toff) after the designation of an Early Termination Date.  This language ha= s been reviewed by U.S. bankruptcy counsel, and is appropriate under U.S. l= aws for commodity transactions with U.S.-based counterparties.  Each group = will need to review this language with their local counsel in each jurisdic= tion in which EWS trades in order to ensure enforceability.   In addition, = prior to introducing this language into your forms, changes will be require= d to terminology and/or to include terminations resulting from events other=  than Events of Default (e.g. ""Affected Party"" under ISDA).  Finally, when = incorporating this setoff language into the EWS trading forms, please be aw= are that this language is not intended to override the payment netting term= s (monthly netting of receivables) or the close-out netting procedures (app= licable upon the designation of an Event of Default), both of which should = remain in the trading forms.  Rather, this language is only intended to add=  setoff rights to all EWS trading forms.  When incorporating this setoff la= nguage into your trading forms, you will need to review the forms to determ= ine if there are any references to setoff or other similar concepts that wi= ll need to be overridden and/or coordinated.  Finally, in order to assist a= ll lawyers in negotiating these setoff provisions, we are in the process of=  preparing a brief explanation of how this setoff works and why it is mutua= lly beneficial to EWS and our counterparties, which explanation you will be=  able to share with your counterparties. This explanation will be distribut= ed shortly.  =09If you have any questions, please contact me at 713-853-6544 or Elizabet= h Sager at 713-853-6349.

Memorandum of Square Set-Off Combinations; 2.  Memorandum of Triangular Set-Off Combinations; 3.  Mandatory Set-Off Language for EWS Trading Contracts -  Revision #1, bl= acklined to the version forwarded by Mark Haedicke; 4.  Clean copy of attachment 3; 5.  Revised Triangular Set Off Provisions; and 6.  Square Set-Off Provision  This is a very interesting although somewhat complex assignment.  At your r= equest I have reviewed the draft Mandatory Setoff Language for EWS Trading = Contracts as well as the set-off language in the draft Master Netting Set-O= ff and Security Agreement with a view to developing terms of set-off that w= ill be enforceable in Canada.  (For the moment, I have considered the laws = applicable in Alberta and have received input from my Ontario partner, Kevi= n McElcheran).  Unlike certain jurisdictions (including, for example, Great Britain), in Ca= nada  a creditor's set-off rights are generally preserved in an insolvency.=   Section 97(3) of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. B-3 a= s amended and section 18.1 of the Companies' Creditors Arrangement Act, S.C= . 1985 c. C-36 as amended, both expressly reserve application of the law of=  set-off in the context of an insolvency to which those acts apply.  Contra= ctual set-off provisions are ordinarily enforceable in an insolvency provid= ed the contract of which the set-off provision is part is itself enforceabl= e (i.e. has all of the elements of an enforceable contract including privit= y and consideration).  Set-off is a powerful tool in insolvency because it permits a creditor with=  an otherwise unsecured claim to effectively satisfy that claim on a dollar= -for-dollar basis out of amounts the creditor in turn owes to the insolvent=  company.  This is done at the expense of other unsecured creditors who wou= ld otherwise receive the benefit of the debt owed by the setting-off credit= or to the insolvent company.  The essence of set-off is mutuality: the setting-off of a claim and cross-c= laim between the same parties.  The difficulty with the expansive set-off t= erms sought by Enron is that they would permit ""set-off"" as between Enron a= nd its counterparty of debts owed by or to a third party.  My concern is th= at such purported ""set-off"" is so different in substance from the common no= tion of set-off which requires mutuality, as to be set-off in name only.  W= ithout mutuality, I am concerned that a court may not recognize such ""set-o= ff"" of obligations relating to third parties as ""set-off"" within the meanin= g of Canadian insolvency legislation.  The concern is not only that a court=  may be reticent to allow receivables owed by third parties to the insolven= t state to be used to satisfy the insolvent estate's indebtedness to a cred= itor.  The court may be view any contractual arrangement that baldly purpor= ts to do that as something other than set-off known under the laws of Canad= a.  I am not, however, aware of any case law on point.  With a view to solving the perceived problem with lack of mutuality, I have=  incorporated language (referred to in the materials as an ""aggregate liabi= lity clause"") to try and ensure that in each instance the claim and cross-c= laim will be between the same parties.  The first two attachments analyse the various combinations involved in squa= re and triangular set-off.  These memoranda serve as a check list to ensure=  that the proposed language will cover every possible combination of claim = and cross-claim.  Turning now to the Mandatory Setoff Language for EWS Trading Contracts (att= achment 3), I have the following comments:  1.    I have included wording to clarify that the option to set-off is to b= e exercised jointly by X and its affiliates.  The reason for this is to avo= id the uncertainty associated with multiple parties having the ability to e= xercise inconsistent set-off options.  We must assume that this set-off pro= vision will be included in separate contracts between a counterparty and va= rious Enron affiliates.  If the counterparty defaults on more than one of t= hese contracts, (or if they contain cross-default provisions,) the Enron af= filiate that is a party to each separate contract would be ""X"" under that c= ontract and would have the option to exercise the set-off rights thereunder=  including the right to set-off against amounts it owes, amounts that are o= wed to any of its affiliates.  Those affiliates may each in turn be ""X"" und= er their respective contracts and similarly entitled to exercise set-off ri= ghts.  While it is unlikely that Enron and its affiliates would act inconsi= stently in exercising set-off rights, making it clear that the option to se= t-off must be exercised jointly by X and its affiliates, minimizes any atta= ck of the set-off provision on the basis of uncertainty associated with the=  potential for inconsistent exercise of the option to set-off.  2.  With respect to the requirement that the set-off contract must have con= sideration, I have included an acknowledgement by the parties (including af= filiates) that each has received valuable consideration for the covenants i= nvolved.  This provision is not a complete answer to the requirement of con= sideration but is helpful.  3.  Paragraph (B) is included to address the mutuality requirement by inclu= ding an aggregate liability clause, as discussed above.  4.  In the second paragraph of Mandatory Setoff Language for EWS Trading Co= ntracts, the changes to the sentence including ""limitation to"" have been ma= de to clarify that the set-off provision is without limitation to any other=  rights which X or its affiliates may have.  I was concerned that the ""with= out prejudice"" language in the prior draft, would leave it open to the defa= ulting party to argue that the set-off provision cannot work to its prejudi= ce.  5.  The balance of the revisions are simply drafting changes made in an att= empt to improve the clarity and certainty of the terms involved.  In attach= ment 3 I have attempted to minimize the changes with the result that it is = not as clear and certain as it might be.  I have also attached a revised tr= iangular set-off provision (attachment 5) which is clearer, more certain an= d about one page longer.  Finally, I have included a square set-off provision (attachment 6) which af= fords Enron (and any non-defaulting counterparty) even better set-off prote= ction.  As discussed, I will include this provision in the Master, Netting = Setoff and Security Agreement form.  I would be pleased to discuss the attachments with you at your convenience.

The EEI creep was evident when Mike Small after himself, personally,  takin= g credit for drafting Enron's market disruption language (he said it was ve= ry time consuming to draft) proceeded to be challenged by all the EEI membe= rs who the day before had sat around the table for 2 productive hours chall= enging certain concepts that Enron originally proposed (as a result we will=  be modifying our language soon since some good issues were raised).  After=  hearing the new issues Mike threw up his arms and asked that we propose ne= w language.  Afterwards, I spoke with Mike, sorry Clyde, and proposed to me= et with him to discuss the possibility of bringing the groups together, usi= ng the absurdity of the market disruption language discussion as good evide= nce of what we could achieve together.  He said theoretically that might be=  able to happen but he never saw it happening.  I asked why.  He said too p= ainful.  What pain.  He said Shari Stack.

The NEPOOL confirmation does not reflect the most recent change that was made to fix the NEPOOL PTF points.   The language you sent me from Steve Hall closely resembles the current confirmation language used for the SP-15 and NP-15 delivery points.   From a regulatory perspective, as we discussed, we need to be better informed as to the issues and likely framework and structure of the RTOs, which will assist in the drafting of a relatively ""certain"" delivery point, however until the market is truly established I would expect there to be definitions which rely upon liquidity to feature and the different ways in which liquidity can be calculated, or the fixing of existing delivery points, or simply Seller's choice, possibly with some refinements and limitations as to where the power can be delivered.

Paragraph 2 provides that ""This Order applies only to administrative expense claims pursuant to Bankruptcy Code section 503(a) arising from the sale of electric energy or services for PG&E's customers through the California Independent System Operator (the ""ISO"") or from the sale of electric energy or services by the California Department of Water Resources (the ""DWR"") (collectively , ""ISO/DWR Administrative Claims"").  For purposes of this Order, ISO/DWR Administrative Claims shall not include the following: (i) claims arising from ""reliabil,ity must run"" (""RMR"") charges, (ii) claims by the ISO, and (iii) claims by the DWR based solely on power purchased for direct sale to customers of PG&E, and for which the DWR asserts no independent claim against PG&E or PG&E's bankruptcy estate.""  I understand that EPMI sold power to PG&E between April 6, the filing date, and April 9, the date on which EPMI terminated the contract.  Are these considered sales through the ISO?

"Hi! Maybe email is the best way to talk!!! I actually do most of my communicating this way anyway! I went to yoga last Wednesday night AND Saturday afternoon. While I enjoyed the Wednesday class, I hated the Saturday class. It was a younger crowd and there were too many people. I will continue to go to the Wednesday class but never again on the Saturday one. However, I like your idea of going on Sundays and I would not like to get stuck with just one instructor.

"Elizabeth, please call me to let me know how you want to proceed on this.  I reviewed with Mary last week the set-of language for the trading forms in light of Robert Anderson's review and suggested revisions.  Mary had reviewed the language with your outside counsel and for reasons, most of which I did not necessarily follow to be honest, they were not agreeable to Robert's suggested revisions (other than the ""without limitation"" language (which I note has now been inserted only in part, and therefore may still problematic, in that it refers to being without limitation to either party's rights, which would include the defaulting party's right to object to the enforceability of the entire set-off provision or to assert some alternate form of set-off arrangement)).  I agreed with Mary that I would again review that matter with Robert.  I have again reviewed the matter with Robert, and he remains concerned with the language as is, since the triangular set-off as proposed without also dealing with the issue of mutuality, which is fundamental to the concept of set-off, results in a contractual agreement (assuming that we get past the privity and consideration issues), to call something ""set-off"" that fundamentally is not set-off.  Robert's concern is that if the issue of mutuality is not addressed the current language could be viewed by a court not as set-off but as an assignment of a third obligation as security, that may be unenforceable for various reasons, including non-perfection.  Robert also makes the following points:  1.  His suggested revisions already are a compromise from what he believes would be required in a more detailed provision addressing these complex issues;  2.  To the extent that we introduce triangular set-off that may not ultimately be enforceable, we are running the risk of the entire clause not be allowed by the courts, and therefore having no right to set-off;  3.  As drafting points, the ""without limitation"" language still provides the defaulting party with an argument to avoid the entire arrangement, and there is no specified date for the currency conversion;  4.  In terms of the issue of consideration, it is an issue of contract formation, which is fundamental to a contractual right of set-off;  5.  In terms of when the mutuality of the obligations arises, he is agrees that it would be best that it arise form inception, but he thought that would be difficult to sell commercially, and therefore setled on default but prior to elected termination.  In short, Robert's point is that even with his revisions he would have concerns, but without his revisions he has serious concerns around enforceability, and it is difficult for me to simply ignore his advice given both his reasoning and my experience with Robert's advice.  In terms of where to go, I think there are the following solutions:  1.  We can see this as a Canadian issue, and therefore incorporate Robert's changes in the Canadian forms only - physical and financial;  2.  We can have Robert speak to your outside counsel and see if they can't come to some common ground on more universal language;  3.  We can leave the matter as is for all forms.  (I am more comfortable with 1 than 3.)  Why don't you give me a call.  I am sure we all want to move past this and, ackowledginging the risks, simply need to agree on a definitive approach.

ISDA Statement      As part of its efforts to assist the markets resolve certain issues arising out of this week's events, ISDA has been asked to consider the implications of certain continuing problems with futures exchanges and price source publications for commodity derivatives.  Attached in the form of a draft statement from ISDA are a series of proposals that have been made by a number of institutions active in the OTC commodity derivatives area to resolve pricing difficulties.  We welcome your comments on these proposals.  The purpose of this distribution is to encourage all participants in the markets for these products to consider the issues raised and, we hope, to come to some consensus position that can be reflected in a statement in the style of the attached draft by ISDA.  Please send any comments to Kimberly Summe (ksumme@isda.org) as soon as possible on Friday morning.  Please contact me at ISDA at 212-332-1203 if you have any questions.

During our first meeting, the girls learned a bit of GS history, said the Girl  Scout Promise and Law, sang two new GS songs and talked about the many  activities that they might participate in as a Girl Scout.  We also made 55  greeting cards for a Council sponsored service project where cards will be  sent to residents of nursing homes in Texas.  It was a great  meeting!     A few days after our troop meeting, we learned  of an interesting service opportunity.    Scouting for Food is a special day, October 20th,  for Girl Scouts to help feed the hungry.  Girls ages 6-11years old will  tour the Houston Food Bank, participate in a service project, have a snack and  receive a ""Scouting for Food"" patch.     The specifics are:  Saturday, October 20th, 9:00 a.m. - 11:15  a.m.  Houston Food Bank, 3811 Eastex Freeway, Houston, TX  77026  A parent needs to accompany each  child.  Response deadline:  Wednesday, September 25, email Joy  Lee jeffjoylee@earthlink.net <<mailto:jeffjoylee@earthlink.net>> , or  713-660-8764     There is a fee of $3 per girl for this event.   The troop will be paying for the girls, therefore it is VERY IMPORTANT that we  have an accurate count.  There is no fee for the parents.     Sorry for the short deadline, but we have to pay to  reserve our spots and this event will fill up.     If you are interested in attending or have any  questions, please contact Joy quickly.

To date, Consumers has not indicated a desire to conduct any discovery whatsoever.  Unbelievable.  Our counsel believes that Consumers doesn't really think this case will be arbitrated; but rather is hoping that as we approach an arbitration date, we will become much more willing to compromise.  As far as an arbitration date is concerned, nothing is set yet. We have agreed to approach the arbitrator (Professor White) after the depositions and check his calendar for available dates.

WASHINGTON -(Dow Jones)- The U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission shouldn't order refunds for power sales in the Pacific Northwest, a FERC administrative law judge told the commission Monday.  ""I recommend that the commission not order refunds in this case because the prices weren't unreasonable and, unlike (California), the market is a competitive market,"" concluded Carmen Cintron, the FERC judge presiding over the case.  The spiraling prices in California's dysfunctional power market were only one of many factors contributing to the region's high electricity prices, which were primarily the result of a supply shortage as the hydropower-dependent region experienced a drought, the judge said.  ""Spot market bilateral sales constituted only a small percentage of the total volume of transactions in the region because forward contracts are heavily relied on,"" Cintron said.  Overruling the finding of FERC trial staff, Cintron found there was no evidence that sellers exercised market power in the region.  ""The prices were agreed to by willing buyers and sellers,"" the judge said.  The judge urged FERC to grant a motion by Puget Energy Inc. (PSD) and dismiss the case.        At issue were refund claims totaling more than $1.9 billion, with three-quarters of that amount claimed by California on behalf of the state's Department of Water Resources for purchases in the refund period of Dec. 25, 2000, to June 20, 2001.  In July, FERC set the case for an expedited hearing before Cintron after separating the Pacific Northwest claims from a larger refund proceeding involving power sales in California from Oct. 2, 2000, through June 20, 2001.  The administrative law judge is scheduled to forward an initial decision to the commission in the California refund case in December.  Unlike California, the Northwest had a vibrant and functional competitive market, and ordering refunds for the minority of those in the proceeding making claims would have detrimental effects on the market, Cintron told the commission.  ""Evidence of record indicates that refunds would have a negative impact to the Pacific Northwest market,"" Cintron concluded. ""This business relies on finality of deals and reliance on your trading partner.""  ""Balancing the short-term benefit of refunds to a few market participants against the immediate and long-term damage to the market and to future investment decisions, it is impossible to reconcile refunds with the overall public-interest standard,"" Cintron said.  California sought $1.466 billion of the nearly $2 billion in total claims. The remainder was claimed by municipally owned utilities in Seattle ($278 million); Tacoma, Wash. ($65.4 million); Clark, Wash. ($64 million); Eugene, Ore. ($39.7 million); Sacramento, Calif. ($4.6 million); and Northern Wasco County, Ore. ($4 million).  Also, the Port of Seattle sought $9.4 million in refunds.  Cintron was persuaded by the ""ripple"" claims arguments of the majority opposing refunds. They argued that awarding the claims of the few seeking refunds would destabilize the overall market, since most sellers themselves would then stake claims for refunds.  ""Unraveling these transactions is, to be mildly stated, a complex task,"" Cintron said.  ""The immense number of potential ripple claims is directly related to the highly active nature of the (Pacific Northwest) wholesale electricity market,"" the judge said.  ""Given the sheer magnitude of contracts that would have to be rewritten as a result of ordering refunds, it would be impossible to unwind the chain of transactions that resulted in a single bilateral sale,"" she said.  The commission may either accept or reject Cintron's recommendations, which were intended to form the basis for whether FERC should order a more expansive hearing to determine refund amounts owed.  In the event FERC does move to order refunds, Cintron offered her conclusions on what constitutes a spot-market sale in the region's bilateral contracts market.  While power marketers had argued for a strict definition - sales of no more than 24 hours duration - those seeking refunds had argued that refunds should apply to sales for periods of up to a year or longer, particularly if they were indexed to spot-market prices.  Cintron accepted the middle-of-the road recommendation of the Bonneville Power Administration to conclude that spot-market sales should include transactions of up to one-month duration.      -By Bryan Lee, Dow Jones Newswires; 202-862-6647; Bryan.Lee@dowjones.com",b..sanders@enron.com,elizabeth.sager@enron.com,FW: FERC Judge Rejects Claims For Elec Refunds In Pacific NW,2001-09-25 08:07:00-07:00,sent

""The prices were agreed to by willing buyers and sellers,"" the judge said.  The judge urged FERC to grant a motion by Puget Energy Inc. (PSD) and dismiss the case.        At issue were refund claims totaling more than $1.9 billion, with three-quarters of that amount claimed by California on behalf of the state's Department of Water Resources for purchases in the refund period of Dec. 25, 2000, to June 20, 2001.  In July, FERC set the case for an expedited hearing before Cintron after separating the Pacific Northwest claims from a larger refund proceeding involving power sales in California from Oct. 2, 2000, through June 20, 2001.  The administrative law judge is scheduled to forward an initial decision to the commission in the California refund case in December.  Unlike California, the Northwest had a vibrant and functional competitive market, and ordering refunds for the minority of those in the proceeding making claims would have detrimental effects on the market, Cintron told the commission.  ""Evidence of record indicates that refunds would have a negative impact to the Pacific Northwest market,"" Cintron concluded. ""This business relies on finality of deals and reliance on your trading partner.""  ""Balancing the short-term benefit of refunds to a few market participants against the immediate and long-term damage to the market and to future investment decisions, it is impossible to reconcile refunds with the overall public-interest standard,"" Cintron said.  California sought $1.466 billion of the nearly $2 billion in total claims. The remainder was claimed by municipally owned utilities in Seattle ($278 million); Tacoma, Wash. ($65.4 million); Clark, Wash. ($64 million); Eugene, Ore. ($39.7 million); Sacramento, Calif. ($4.6 million); and Northern Wasco County, Ore. ($4 million).  Also, the Port of Seattle sought $9.4 million in refunds.  Cintron was persuaded by the ""ripple"" claims arguments of the majority opposing refunds. They argued that awarding the claims of the few seeking refunds would destabilize the overall market, since most sellers themselves would then stake claims for refunds.  ""Unraveling these transactions is, to be mildly stated, a complex task,"" Cintron said.  ""The immense number of potential ripple claims is directly related to the highly active nature of the (Pacific Northwest) wholesale electricity market,"" the judge said.  ""Given the sheer magnitude of contracts that would have to be rewritten as a result of ordering refunds, it would be impossible to unwind the chain of transactions that resulted in a single bilateral sale,"" she said.  The commission may either accept or reject Cintron's recommendations, which were intended to form the basis for whether FERC should order a more expansive hearing to determine refund amounts owed.  In the event FERC does move to order refunds, Cintron offered her conclusions on what constitutes a spot-market sale in the region's bilateral contracts market.  While power marketers had argued for a strict definition - sales of no more than 24 hours duration - those seeking refunds had argued that refunds should apply to sales for periods of up to a year or longer, particularly if they were indexed to spot-market prices.  Cintron accepted the middle-of-the road recommendation of the Bonneville Power Administration to conclude that spot-market sales should include transactions of up to one-month duration.      -By Bryan Lee, Dow Jones Newswires; 202-862-6647; Bryan.Lee@dowjones.com",b..sanders@enron.com,elizabeth.sager@enron.com,RE: FERC Judge Rejects Claims For Elec Refunds In Pacific NW,2001-09-25 08:17:30-07:00,sent

Second, what about more substantive matters, such as who takes the lead in sending transaction confirmations?  In the A'lones transaction, it is contemplated that EES will be the Buyer.  The Edison form places primary confirmation obligations on the Seller.  I am informed that EES prefers to be the confirming party, regardless of whether it is the buyer or seller.

We've discussed that the document notes Enron North America as the applicant.  If this is the case, we will need additional information, including signed tariff agreements, in order to process this application.  If the applicant is one of our current Enron affiliates which are NYISO market participants, Enron Energy Services, or Enron Power Marketing, the Acknowledgement and Certification document needs to be revised and resubmitted, with of course, a value of the mwhs intended for bidding.  b)  The registration material indicates that Enron intends to submit an Irrevocable Letter of Credit.  Please advise if you intend to submit our standard format, which is included in the NYISO Financial Assurance Policy (Addendum B of the Registration Packet).  For your convenience, the Packet is attached.  If you plan on submitting any other format, be it your own, or a revised version of the standard format, you should forward a draft of that document as soon as possible.

According to M.P.E.P. Sectio= n 608.01, Examiners must now review applications to make sure that hyperlin= ks and other forms of browser-executable code are not included in the text = of the application, unless the hyperlink or browser-executable code is part=  of the applicant's invention and therefore must be included in the applica= tion in order to comply with 35 U.S.C. Section 112 (and as long as the appl= icant does notintend to have the link be active). The end result is that Ex= aminers will (or at least should) now require any such unnecessary hyperlin= ks or browser-executable code to be deleted from patent applications. Furth= er, and perhaps more importantly, M.P.E.P. Section 608.01(p) now prohibits = incorporation of subject matter by reference to a hyperlink or browser-exec= utable code. The PTO's rationale for this rule of practice is that they don= 't want patents or applicat! ions on their web site including links to comm= ercial sites that they don't control. (As for links that are part of the ap= plicant's invention, the PTO will disable the links before posting the text=  on their web site.).   One way to work within this new rule of practice ma= y be to rephrase any such link or code in a way that a computer won't detec= t as a hyperlink or browser-executable code, but that a reader will underst= and sufficiently to be able to refer to the referenced site.

Our EBS tax contact (Wayne Gardner) advises us that ENA/EPMI handle the franchise tax issue with some form of out-of-state swap, or something along that line.

This amount  should be rounded to the nearest dollar amount ($159.00) when used in the collateral calculation process..  The collateral formula is as follow:  The price delta of $159.00 is multiplied by the exposure calculation factor of 14 ($159.00 x 14 = $2,226.00).  This equals the dollar amount of collateral required per mega watt hour (MWH).  The $2,226.00 is then multiplied by the maximum number of MWH's the Market Participant may wish to bid on a daily basis.  The Market Participant notifies the NYISO of the maximum number of MWH's they  may wish to bid  per day by completing, executing and returning the  ACKNOWLEDGEMENT AND CERTIFICATION OF UNDERSTANDING OF NYISO FINANCIAL ASSURANCE POLICY AND PROCEDURES FOR VIRTUAL TRANSACTIONS.  This document is attached to Addendum A of the NYISO Registration Packet dated August 28, 2001.(refer to Page A6 of the Addendum A).  The NYISO Registration Packet is located on the NYISO web site at:  http://www.nyiso.com/services/relations/cregistration/pdf/nyiso_reg.pdf  The example used in Addendum A stated the Market Participant wished to bid up to a maximum of 1600 MWH's per day.  In this example, the collateral required would be $2,226.00 x 1600.

"Yes, I liked him a lot.  I wish he were more conveniently located, and that he was on my insurance network.  I've got to go out of network if I keep seeing him.  I have a pediatrician close by and I like her, but she's new out of her residency and doesn't know as much as Injac does.  He had a lot more information to give me on several items I had talked to her about. Where are you going?  Vacation, I hope. Connor has mommyitis.  He doesn't want me to ever leave him - and it's too restrictive.  Our 2 day a week nanny went on vacation for 2 weeks and now he's upset if she has him.  How quickly they change.  I guess that's the good news also. My phone # is 832-358-1543 (they wouldn't give me a 713 number, to my surprise).  Oh well, there are worse things than having a difficult phone number.

California officials now argue that such provisions indicate that suppliers had undue bargaining power.  Rather than protecting suppliers, these provisions are having the opposite effect of drawing political and legal scrutiny.---sch   THE STATE Energy Pacts Bar State From Seeking U.S. Review of Prices Crisis: The provisions suggest the amount of clout generators had during negotiations. Consumer advocates want the agreements redone. By VIRGINIA ELLIS and NANCY VOGEL TIMES STAFF WRITERS  October 15 2001  SACRAMENTO -- Buried in the fine print of the long-term contracts California officials signed to buy billions of dollars in electricity are provisions giving up the state's right to seek a federal examination of whether the contract prices are unreasonably high.  Critics of the contracts call those clauses the clearest evidence yet that many of the agreements need to be renegotiated.  ""You would never find a provision like that in a contract that was negotiated under normal circumstances, because it's patently ridiculous,"" said Senate Energy Committee Chairwoman Debra Bowen (D-Marina del Rey). ""It demonstrates how much clout the generators had in negotiating these contracts."" The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission is obligated to ensure that wholesale power prices are ""just and reasonable."" If the FERC finds otherwise, it has the authority to order power sellers to refund profits.  In recent weeks, Loretta Lynch, president of the state Public Utilities Commission, has asked the FERC to review two of the state's long-term power contracts. The prices and terms of those contracts may be ""unjust and unreasonable,"" Lynch said. Neither contract had the no-challenge clause.  But when asked about contracts that include the prohibition, Lynch expressed outrage.  ""They didn't want anybody looking over their shoulder,"" she said. ""From my perspective, that contractual provision is great evidence that the generators knew they were sticking up the state. . . . If they thought this was a reasonable contract, why wouldn't they want FERC to uphold their deal?""  State's Bargaining Position Was Weak  The companies with no-challenge clauses in their contracts included Mirant Americas Energy Marketing, Dynegy Power Marketing, Sempra Energy Resources, Allegheny Energy Supply Co., Coral Power and Williams Energy Marketing & Trading.  S. David Freeman, the state's chief negotiator on long-term power contracts who was recently named head of the Consumer Power and Conservation Financing Authority, said the clause needed to be understood in the context of the energy crisis.  At the time the contracts were negotiated, the state's two largest utilities, Pacific Gas & Electric and Southern California Edison, had already failed to pay energy companies hundreds of millions of dollars for power purchases.  ""Our reputation as a state for sticking by what we said and having credit was not all that great in January,"" he said. ""They were asking, 'Is this a serious deal? Is the state of California committed to it?' What are you going to say--no? [Then] you're not going to get a deal.""  The state began a hurried effort to negotiate long-term contracts in January after energy prices on the spot market spiraled to unprecedented heights. The costs threatened to bankrupt the state's utilities, which were unable to buy power on their own for their customers.  State officials negotiated dozens of contracts, some lasting as long as 10 years, which offered prices ranging from $58 to $249 per megawatt-hour--a far cry from the $500 per megawatt-hour the state was frequently paying on the spot market at the time.  But by summer, the wild energy market stabilized and prices dropped. California suddenly found itself paying more under the long-term contracts than the $15-to-$30 per megawatt-hour offered on the spot market.  ""Look at the context in which the state was entering into these contracts. They were pretty much desperate,"" said Mike Florio, senior attorney for the Utility Reform Network in San Francisco.  ""We were talking about windfall profits, taxes and seizing power plants, and I think the generators started putting in their contracts anything they could think of to keep the state from undoing the deal once things calmed down, which they have.""  Michael J. Niggli, president of Sempra Energy Resources, said the clauses provided ""the kind of reassurance that allows the financial community to say we're willing to invest in California.""  ""It's not that we're superseding anything, frankly, it's that we've said we don't want the party we've done the transaction with to try to derail it,"" Niggli said.  He acknowledged that the contract clause cannot prevent the state from asking for federal review.  ""The question becomes, 'Will FERC accept that or consider that?' "" he said. ""And then, 'Do we consider that a breach of the contract in any way shape or form?' ""  Bowen and Freeman predicted that the clauses would not stand up to court scrutiny. ""Frankly, I wasn't too concerned about the clause,"" Freeman said. ""I don't think it's enforceable.""  Enforceable or not, Bowen said, the clauses would complicate any state efforts to seek FERC review.  ""The very fact that they were able to get that kind of language in the contracts tells you it wasn't an evenhanded situation,"" she said. ""I believe the state in negotiating the contracts did the best possible job it could under the circumstances, but that doesn't excuse [officials] from the responsibility of trying to improve the situation now.""

During our first meeting, the girls learned a bit of GS history, said the Girl  Scout Promise and Law, sang two new GS songs and talked about the many  activities that they might participate in as a Girl Scout.  We also made 55  greeting cards for a Council sponsored service project where cards will be  sent to residents of nursing homes in Texas.  It was a great  meeting!     A few days after our troop meeting, we learned  of an interesting service opportunity.    Scouting for Food is a special day, October 20th,  for Girl Scouts to help feed the hungry.  Girls ages 6-11years old will  tour the Houston Food Bank, participate in a service project, have a snack and  receive a ""Scouting for Food"" patch.     The specifics are:  Saturday, October 20th, 9:00 a.m. - 11:15  a.m.  Houston Food Bank, 3811 Eastex Freeway, Houston, TX  77026  A parent needs to accompany each  child.  Response deadline:  Wednesday, September 25, email Joy  Lee jeffjoylee@earthlink.net <<mailto:jeffjoylee@earthlink.net>> , or  713-660-8764     There is a fee of $3 per girl for this event.   The troop will be paying for the girls, therefore it is VERY IMPORTANT that we  have an accurate count.  There is no fee for the parents.     Sorry for the short deadline, but we have to pay to  reserve our spots and this event will fill up.     If you are interested in attending or have any  questions, please contact Joy quickly.     FYI... more will be arriving soon about other troop  activities.

These values are available on the NYISO web site.  The time period of June 1, 2001 through August 31, 2001 was used.  Peak hours are defined here as the hours of 6am (06:00) through and including 10pm (22:00).  The absolute value of the difference of the DAM and R/T price was calculated for each peak hour.  The 97th percentile of these series of prices was calculated for each zone.  The maximum of these zonal 97th percentiles was calculated to be $159.33.  The data manipulation and calculation was performed in MS Excel. The attached spreadsheet contains the data used in the June 2001 to August 2001 calculations.

This amount  should be rounded to the nearest dollar amount ($159.00) when used in the collateral calculation process..  The collateral formula is as follow:  The price delta of $159.00 is multiplied by the exposure calculation factor of 14 ($159.00 x 14 = $2,226.00).  This equals the dollar amount of collateral required per mega watt hour (MWH).  The $2,226.00 is then multiplied by the maximum number of MWH's the Market Participant may wish to bid on a daily basis.  The Market Participant notifies the NYISO of the maximum number of MWH's they  may wish to bid  per day by completing, executing and returning the  ACKNOWLEDGEMENT AND CERTIFICATION OF UNDERSTANDING OF NYISO FINANCIAL ASSURANCE POLICY AND PROCEDURES FOR VIRTUAL TRANSACTIONS.  This document is attached to Addendum A of the NYISO Registration Packet dated August 28, 2001.(refer to Page A6 of the Addendum A).  The NYISO Registration Packet is located on the NYISO web site at:  http://www.nyiso.com/services/relations/cregistration/pdf/nyiso_reg.pdf  The example used in Addendum A stated the Market Participant wished to bid up to a maximum of 1600 MWH's per day.  In this example, the collateral required would be $2,226.00 x 1600. Consequently, the collateral requirement to bid up to a maximum of 1600 MWH's per day in the Virtual Transactions Market would be $3,561,600.

We would appreciate it if you would pass this along to the appropriate member of your staff.  EEI will conduct a one-day workshop to focus issues and discuss options related to the formation of the Energy Industry Standards Board (EISB). The workshop will take place on Friday, November 9, at the Hyatt Regency Hotel at Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport.   The meeting will take place from  8 a.m. - 4 p.m.  The purpose of the meeting is to gather EEI member input on EISB formation issues related to both wholesale and retail electric standards.  As you know, the Gas Industry Standards Board (GISB) recently expanded its charter to include the development of electricity standards.  FERC Chairman Pat Wood has endorsed this action, as well as Commissioner Massey and Commissioner Brownell.  Business practice standardization issues will be discussed this week at the FERC RTO workshops, focusing on a potential regulatory role in defining candidates for standardized business practices.  For hotel accommodations, please contact the hotel directly at 972-453-1234 and ask for the EEI GISB-EISB special room rate of $119/night.  A meeting registration information and response form is attached.  We will provide briefing materials to workshop participants in advance of the meeting.  For additional information, please contact Dave Dworzak, Manager, Transmission Policy at 202-508-5684 or at ddworzak@eei.org if you have any questions or need more information.

I am the original and only owner of this bike. This bike is white with blue lettering. The components are the original Suntour Accushift alpha-3040 group.

This bike has been hanging in my garage by the stem and saddle (not by the rims) for the last few years. The tires have gone down, but will hold air for a few days. It does have a few paint chips on the front fork (see photo) and there is surface rust in these chips, on the rear freewheel, and on the chain.  With a good cleaning, good lube, and new rubber this will be an awesome bike at a great price. Don't miss this great chance to get atop Cannondale Craftsmanship.

"Elizabeth,  Background: On Wednesday, October 10, the NPUC voted to authorize its General Counsel to seek to void or renegotiate certain SPP/NP long-term power contracts by either going to court or filing a complaint at FERC.  According to the utilities, the contracts are out-of-the-money by approximately $800 million.   Enclosed, you'll find. . . .:  Attached is a spreadsheet showing all of the physical Enron-SPP/NP deals that are (1) currently flowing or (2) scheduled for future delivery.  I have left off transactions that have been completed because the tenor of SPP/NP's statements indicates that they are seeking prospective relief, not refunds.  I am also going to fax to you two pages showing our credit exposure to SPP and NP.  Worst case, back of the envelope, we are looking at approximately $400 million in MTM exposure for all deals.  However, the prices under these deals range from $27.50/MWh to $311/MWh (the $3.60 deal is for transmission).  It's extremely unlikely that FERC would (1) void every transaction or (2) reduce the price for every deal to $0.  Therefore, the true amount at risk is less than $400 million.  Bottom line:  All in all, I think the risk of FERC undoing these transactions is unlikely for the following reasons:  1.  The ALJ in the Pacific Northwest refund case rejected claims for refunds of bilateral transactions because (1) the non-California long-term market was competitive, and (2) because of the concern about ""ripple"" claims.  Although the Commission has not yet adopted the ALJ's recommendation, I expect they will because it's the path of least resistance and has popular support.  2.  SPP/NP is the only party arguing that the Southwest market is uncompetitive.  This aspect was fatal to the Pacific Northwest claims because the majority of the market did not want refunds.  3.  SPP/NP was not required to buy power under these contracts----unlike the California utilities, which were required to buy from the PX.  Presumably, these were the lowest prices available at the time.  4.  If FERC voids or reprices these contracts, it will be pressured to do the same for California's DWR contracts.  Contracts/Collateral:  These transactions are all under the WSPP.  We currently hold no collateral from SPP/NP.  Tracy Ngo informs me that we have not insisted on margin or additional collateral because her understanding was that the WSPP did not let her ask for collateral absent an objective event, such as a credit downgrade or failure to get a rate increase.  I advised her that the WSPP standard allows for a call for collateral if the counterparty's ""financial viability"" decreases.  My view is that SPP/NP's admission that it is $800 million under water is, in itself, cause for a margin call.  I am, however, sensitive to the fact that a margin call might (1) be perceived as ""punishing"" SPP/NP for ""trying to enforce the law,"" or (2) strengthen SPP/NP's resolve to seek refunds.  Tracy will not request collateral until you have weighed in on this.  Mitigation:  I spoke with Tim Belden and Tracy Ngo about this on Monday the 15th.  There is zero interest in trying to work with SPP/NP on a blend/extend.  ""Why should we loan a shaky counterparty more money?""  There is also the feeling that we stand a great chance of winning at FERC.  Ultimately, we three were unable to come up with any ways to mitigate the exposure, other than being ready to vigorously respond to this challenge at FERC and being prepared to issue a statement to the press after the complaint is filed at FERC.

Although the Commission has not yet adopted the ALJ's recommendation, I expect they will because it's the path of least resistance and has popular support.  2.  SPP/NP is the only party arguing that the Southwest market is uncompetitive.  This aspect was fatal to the Pacific Northwest claims because the majority of the market did not want refunds.  3.  SPP/NP was not required to buy power under these contracts----unlike the California utilities, which were required to buy from the PX.  Presumably, these were the lowest prices available at the time.  4.  If FERC voids or reprices these contracts, it will be pressured to do the same for California's DWR contracts.   Contracts/Collateral:  These transactions are all under the WSPP.  We currently hold no collateral from SPP/NP.  Tracy Ngo informs me that we have not insisted on margin or additional collateral because her understanding was that the WSPP did not let her ask for collateral absent an objective event, such as a credit downgrade or failure to get a rate increase.  I advised her that the WSPP standard allows for a call for collateral if the counterparty's ""financial viability"" decreases.  My view is that SPP/NP's admission that it is $800 million under water is, in itself, cause for a margin call.  I am, however, sensitive to the fact that a margin call might (1) be perceived as ""punishing"" SPP/NP for ""trying to enforce the law,"" or (2) strengthen SPP/NP's resolve to seek refunds.  Tracy will not request collateral until you have weighed in on this.  Mitigation:  I spoke with Tim Belden and Tracy Ngo about this on Monday the 15th.  There is zero interest in trying to work with SPP/NP on a blend/extend.  ""Why should we loan a shaky counterparty more money?""  There is also the feeling that we stand a great chance of winning at FERC.  Ultimately, we three were unable to come up with any ways to mitigate the exposure, other than being ready to vigorously respond to this challenge at FERC and being prepared to issue a statement to the press after the complaint is filed at FERC.

" Elizabeth,   I am going to divide my presentation into two parts.  One is going to be designed to give the marketers ""talking points""  and the other is going to be a technical thing where I show them some bad wording and tell a couple of scary war stories.   I would like to get your take on the following kind of big picture Enron policy on WSPP approach. Unless you agree with and support this kind of ""How Enron views the WSPP"" policy, I shouldn't be advocating it at the meeting.     Enron's view is that the days of comparing the WSPP Agreement to the EEI should be coming to an end.  It is time for a joint committee of WSPP and EEI experts to merge the agreements.  Everybody is wasting too much time comparing the two agreements and trying to say one is better than the other.  Every amendment that has been made in the past two years brings the agreements closer and closer into alignment and it is preposterous for any serious lawyer to argue that we are better off with two agreements, one that is almost like the other one.  Valuable resource time is being wasted.  Enron believes that a joint committee should accelerate the merger of the agreements.    This will free up the WSPP organization to do what it does best:  provide an extremely useful industry formum kind of function.  The WSPP should be focusing on more boondoggles and more future looking work like getting ready for RTO West, dealing with the emerging California changes, and open access in Oregon and Nevada.   Right now, the highly talented regional organization is spending an unfortunate amount of time trying to distinguish its contract from the EEI when both are converging toward the same center.  This unfortunate distraction is keeping the WSPP from adding the tremendous value it does add through its boondoggles and industry issue discussions. The WSPP organization is needed for bigger and better things than dragging us through an ever narrowing labyrinth of legal distinctions.   We need this kind of glazed over positive spin on the WSPP process because our marketers do not like to be isolated from the cozy herd at these boondoggles.  Sales people do not want to feel alone and different.  They are all about the slimy intimacy of sales.  It is hard for Stewart Rosman to go to Cour d'Lane and have Greg Wolf and Shari Stack confront him with difficult questions about why Enron is voting so and so on such and such.  He wants to feel loved.  Therefore,  this policy would let our marketers praise the WSPP for being a great organization,  but at the same time, advocate that it become even greater by declaring victory on the contract front and shifting over to more important projects.  Rosman should say:  Enron loves the WSPP,  it has done a great job with the contract reformation,  that task is done,  we now should move on to bigger and better tasks.  Let's get the contract stuff wrapped up with a joint committee and get more important matters on the agenda.     Something like this is what we need to do with this ongoing mess.  Otherwise, we pit Enron's clearmindedness  against a stubborn mass of  inert resistance and much toxic upheaval is the only result.  The world, including our little western power world, is not made up of people sitting around trying to be rational.  It is full of all of the conflicts of history, ambitious tirades, irrational idiocyncracies and strong personalities.  The WSPP institution is like one of the warring tribes of Lebanon.  They are not going to go away.  Enron needs to be more subtle in its regional diplomacy.  Praise them as we bury them on the contract front.  As our headquarters commander, I beg you to  let Steve and me, as field operatives,   pursue this diplomatic initiative over the next months.

"HI   So much wasted time and energy and the well is running dry at the same time the animosity towards Enron and marketers seems only to be increasing. I like the proposal to merge the discussions but... You will recall at the WSPP meeting in Colorado I asked Mike Small if he wouldn't consider merging the discussions/ contracting groups.  After a long winded story about the personal pain he has and will continue to suffer (Shari's name came up a lot), he said he did not think it would ever work.

(Legal) Subject: FW: Legal Discussion   Elizabeth,   I am going to divide my presentation into two parts.  One is going to be designed to give the marketers ""talking points""  and the other is going to be a technical thing where I show them some bad wording and tell a couple of scary war stories.   I would like to get your take on the following kind of big picture Enron policy on WSPP approach. Unless you agree with and support this kind of ""How Enron views the WSPP"" policy, I shouldn't be advocating it at the meeting.     Enron's view is that the days of comparing the WSPP Agreement to the EEI should be coming to an end.  It is time for a joint committee of WSPP and EEI experts to merge the agreements.  Everybody is wasting too much time comparing the two agreements and trying to say one is better than the other.  Every amendment that has been made in the past two years brings the agreements closer and closer into alignment and it is preposterous for any serious lawyer to argue that we are better off with two agreements, one that is almost like the other one.  Valuable resource time is being wasted.  Enron believes that a joint committee should accelerate the merger of the agreements.    This will free up the WSPP organization to do what it does best:  provide an extremely useful industry formum kind of function.  The WSPP should be focusing on more boondoggles and more future looking work like getting ready for RTO West, dealing with the emerging California changes, and open access in Oregon and Nevada.   Right now, the highly talented regional organization is spending an unfortunate amount of time trying to distinguish its contract from the EEI when both are converging toward the same center.  This unfortunate distraction is keeping the WSPP from adding the tremendous value it does add through its boondoggles and industry issue discussions. The WSPP organization is needed for bigger and better things than dragging us through an ever narrowing labyrinth of legal distinctions.   We need this kind of glazed over positive spin on the WSPP process because our marketers do not like to be isolated from the cozy herd at these boondoggles.  Sales people do not want to feel alone and different.  They are all about the slimy intimacy of sales.  It is hard for Stewart Rosman to go to Cour d'Lane and have Greg Wolf and Shari Stack confront him with difficult questions about why Enron is voting so and so on such and such.  He wants to feel loved.  Therefore,  this policy would let our marketers praise the WSPP for being a great organization,  but at the same time, advocate that it become even greater by declaring victory on the contract front and shifting over to more important projects.  Rosman should say:  Enron loves the WSPP,  it has done a great job with the contract reformation,  that task is done,  we now should move on to bigger and better tasks.  Let's get the contract stuff wrapped up with a joint committee and get more important matters on the agenda.     Something like this is what we need to do with this ongoing mess.  Otherwise, we pit Enron's clearmindedness  against a stubborn mass of  inert resistance and much toxic upheaval is the only result.  The world, including our little western power world, is not made up of people sitting around trying to be rational.  It is full of all of the conflicts of history, ambitious tirades, irrational idiocyncracies and strong personalities.  The WSPP institution is like one of the warring tribes of Lebanon.  They are not going to go away.  Enron needs to be more subtle in its regional diplomacy.  Praise them as we bury them on the contract front.  As our headquarters commander, I beg you to  let Steve and me, as field operatives,   pursue this diplomatic initiative over the next months. We can wind these guys up to talk this kind of talk next Wednesday.

I have noted in paragraph 6(h) (and the same comments applies to paragraph 6(i)) that I need further explanation of the provision itself, and I will be happy to discuss this provision with someone from Enron or someone in our shop.  For the most part, the agreement looks pretty good.  Most of my changes focused on the arbitration clause.  Given the nature of this Agreement, we should be careful to include all of the counterparty agreements (for example, I added a reference to a GISB in place between DMT and Enron Energy Services).  If the list of agreements becomes too extensive, then we may want to consider simply listing all of the various Enron entities and Dynegy entities by name within the body of the Agreement, and attaching an exhibit that specifies the Underlying Master Agreements that are in effect at the time this Netting Agreement is executed.  Please contact me with any questions or comments you may have.  Thanks.

This reflects the market power study done for Sandhills, an Enron affiliate, in March.   (While we have filed more recent applications in cases involving Enron, they were for sales of plants to third parties, and therefore studied the 3rd party's market power, not Enron's).   We haven't found anything more recent, but you would probably know that better than I.          We have found several existing Enron affiliates with market rate authority who did not make any sales in the second quarter of 2001.  They might be useful as shells, but I don't know whwther they'd work from an internal corporate perspective.   Those shells are North Carolina Power Holding, West Fork, and two others.    Maybe you could make sales through them for a few days.  At that point, I can call FERC staff and see if we're going to get the new entitiy's authority backdated to today.   If we get a good word from staff, we can then start selling from the new entity.  If not, the worst tcase is that we sell from North Carolina Power (etc) under their existing authority for 60 days, and then start selling under the new entity's name.  >>> ""Nettelton, Marcus"" <Marcus.Nettelton@ENRON.com> 10/29/01 03:55PM >>> Sam - I need to see if we can open Word Perfect files as I am unable to open the document at the moment.

" Elizabeth --The changes by AEP are on the 6th page, Par. 8 and second last paragraph.

I told him if they accepted the $190M number then AEP should fill it in, sign the document and fax it here for countersignature and dispatch of our wire.  I gave him my fax no.

"Reminder - If you are working on a Master Netting Agreement, you also need to understand what type of entities are being included in the netted group.  On the power side, there are regulatory restrictions on a regulated utility from becoming a guarantor of the debts of unregulated companies;  accordingly,  an MNA with a regulated utility and other unaffiliated parties on its side will not work, particularly if you are posting collateral on a fully netted basis.  In this case, the only option would be to keep the underlying margining agreements in place (no new global collateral annex) and have the MNA only be a cross default and acceleration and  possible setoff (just in case the money is going the right way and/or just in case it works).  Mary is working on a new draft of the MNA to be used if we are not superceding the underlying margining terms.

" Attached is a redline of the Master Netting Agreement.  We are narrowing it to limit it to being a set off agreement.  In this way we can avoid having to go through the threshold issues and collateral management issues, which in light of the fact we don't have a Collateral Annex are not insignificant.

"Liz: Here is a summary of comments I have not yet incorporated:  1. Fritz raised the point that if Fixed Independent Amount is selected then both parties could be posting collateral.  If this occurs, he thinks that only Sections 6, 7 and 9 should apply but that Sections 3 and 4 should not.  2. In clause (b) of the definition of Exposure, should we add language at the end that says:  ""when such sum is a positive value, and when such sum is a negative value it represents, conversely, Exposure of Party Y to Party X.  3. Fritz wanted to eliminate the ""demand"" requirement in Section 4 and make collateral posting automatic.  4. Should we eliminate the consent requirement in the last sentence of Section 5(a) (reducing LC's)?  5. Reliant wanted to delete the ""mid point"" language in the definition of Current mark to Market value.  6. Reliant wants to add to Section 6(b)(iii) the phrase ""Secured Party notifies the Pledging party as to the"" after the 1 and 5 day triggers such that the delivery requirement begins after notice.  7. Reliant wants to extend the time frames in Section 8.    8. AEP wants to limit the definition of Credit Rating Event to a ratings drop only.  9.   AEP wants to add language to the definition of Letter of Credit that requires it to be acceptable to the Secured Party.

This is great.   -----Original Message----- From:  Sager, Elizabeth   Sent: Monday, November 05, 2001 2:48 PM To: Walls Jr., Rob Cc: Taylor, Mark E (Legal) Subject: RE:Sager and Taylor comments on Agmt - 11-3 draft  CONFIDENTIAL  Here are some thoughts and comments on Sections 5 and 7 of the Merger Agreement and the  Disclosure Statement.  For ease I have spoken with Mark Taylor and tried to incorporate his thoughts as well.  I have a meeting that will tie me up for awhile but will reread sections one more time and email if I have  any further comments. Call me to discuss whenever you want.  Office 713 853 6349; Cell 713 854 5747.  Thanks  1.  Section 5.6(a) Disclosure Statement - in certain case (unusual contracts may permit termination right upon a change in control) can we add the following words at the end of Section 5.6(a)  ---- ""and/or the contract may be terminated.""   2.  Section 5.6(b) Disclosure Statement - NYMEX, European exchanges, US/Canadian power pools will need to be notified and credit requirements may change as a result. I would proposes adding at end of sentence  ---    ""(e.g., NYMEX, NEPOOL, state retail licensing authorities).  Additional or substitute credit support may be required to be provided by Gipper and/or its Subsidiaries as a result of such notifications.""  3.  Section 5.8  Disclosure Statement- Additional threatened litigation on power side includes PG&E (termination of transactions), New Power (posting of collateral as well as possible shareholder claims), VEPCO (contractual obligations under power contract), NRG (existence of financial trade).  I'm assuming Richard has decided against adding these but we should check. I have a call into him now.  4. Section 5.9 Absence of Changes, Merger Agreement - Section 5.9(iv) states that Ee compensation has been in ordinary course since Dec 2000.  Without knowing for sure, I thought allot of new agreements/arrangements were made. This may need to be checked.   5. Section 7.1(a) Conduct of Business, Merger Agreement - Section only talks about introducing new products.  Should we include the right to stop providing products and services, either in there entirety or only in certain geographical areas as well.    (Business mix is frequently changing particularly I think at EES)(Also do we have the right to stop offering by way of example, steel products, without their approval?).  Should we also include the right to expand geographically the marketing of existing/new products (eg new Canadian markets may open up in next several months - Enron's trading activities there may be construed as new products in a new market).    Finally, as a result of Enron's credit situation, we are doing transactions that are not ""ordinary course"" - we are being asked to help CP's reduce exposures through various means including netting arrangements, ring trades with third parties, assignments, posting collateral based on adequate assurance.  Can we qualify ""ordinary course"" by adding ""taking into consideration credit concerns of our trading partners.""   6. Section 7.1(i), MA - Prohibition on sales of assets - would this include contractual assets?  We are doing assignment transactions w/ trading CP's whereby  we terminate and assign trades in order to reduce exposures for our CP's.    7. Section 7.1(n), MA -No Liens - We are entering into Mater Netting Agreements to alleviate CP credit concerns.  Each Master Netting Agreement is a grant of a security interest in all receivables (including termination payments) under the designated trading contracts.  CPs,  if alert, will file UCCs to perfect. We will perfect ours.  8. Section 7.1(q), MA VAR Limits - Again should we expressly state that we can operate at lower limits? Should we define new products as being old products offered in new geographical regions?

The Floating Price for each Determination Period shall be calculated utilizing the hourly clearing prices published by PJM Interconnection, LLC, for the  VEPCO Interface (VAP), on its official web site currently located at www.pjm.com/pub/account/lmp/index.html, or any successor thereto, under the headings ""PJM - Daily Real-Time Locational Marginal Pricing Files; VAP"" (the ""Index"").

This date appears to be an unscheduled holiday.  The issue we pose to the Committee is the following:  1.  Should ISDA issue a market practice statement on the November 23 closin= g of NYMEX?  2.  If ISDA should issue such a statement, what treatment should result for November 23?  3.  If ISDA should issue such a statement, how should options that expire o= n November 23 be treated?  (This may be less of an issue for European style options).  4.  What types of Market Disruption Events are typically included in your contracts?  I would direct your attention to Section 1.4 of the 1993 ISDA Commodity Derivatives Definitions (definition of Commodity Business Day) and ISDA's Market Practice Statement on Equity Derivatives (available on our website), where September 11, 12, 13 and 14 were not considered trading days for equity derivatives purposes.  I would be grateful if you could respond to Kimberly Summe (ksumme@isda.org= ) on each of the four questions above. Also, I propose to have a conference call on Friday, November 9 at 10:30 a.m. New York Time.

"From: Mark Whitney TheLaw.net Corporation Homepage: http://www.thelaw.net Remove: http://www.thelaw.net/remove.htm       The Bentley Arnage Red Label is a beautiful four door sedan, but it's not for everyone. http://www.bentleymotors.co.uk/bentley/picture_gallery/bentley_2.jpg True though it may be that when ordering the Arnage one gets to specify burr walnut, burr oak, bird's eye maple or black lacquer veneer, most would still find the $200K+ sticker price out of reach. Even most of those in a position to do the deal would walk away in the face of a dubious value proposition. After all, burr oak veneer is still veneer.   WHAT DOES THIS HAVE TO DO WITH LEGAL RESEARCH?       Lawyers from coast-to-coast complain that computer based legal research costs continue to spin out of control. Many, given their firm size, practice area or jurisdiction, simply can no longer justify these onerous annual contracts with West or Lexis. Others have concluded, as one guesses they might with the Bentley, that after peeling back the veneer, these highfalutin compusearchers simply cost more than they are worth.   THEORY vs. REALITY       As nice as it might be to own a Bentley, it would have been nicer still had they simply provided you with a shiny new Arnage for free while you were in law school, just as our competitors regularly hook law students with free unlimited access, only to yank the needle upon graduation.       What percentage of attorneys in the real world enjoy unlimited access to WestLaw? Perhaps more to the point, what percentage enjoy unlimited access to those WestLaw resources that their practice truly demands? Are you one of the select few who wants for little or nothing, or are you in a pick-and-choose mode with the overwhelming majority of your colleagues?       --What do you do when you have to research across state lines?       --What do you do with a Federal question that properly demands a national look across all thirteen Federal circuits?       --How do you respond to a legal research industry that likes to market primary jurisdiction packages and thumbs its nose at the reality that you practice in a state like Vermont, for example, a jurisdiction that only issues about 100 new published opinions ANNUALLY, and not surprisingly has yet to consider anything remotely resembling your client's situation?

We will communicate in a more official sense with you soon.  You seem to be taking a broad, big picture, very reasonable approach to the process issue.  This is long overdue.   I like the way you suggested how there might be a place for a persuasive, rather than academic memo about the convergence issue,  or ""creeping imitation"" as I think it is best characterized.  I will begin to write such a memo and ask for your help in fitting it into the process in the most productive way as this strange process continues to unfold.

Apparently, when the guy came in to set up the phone for the call, Small told him not to do it and sent him out.  I also agree that there seems to be little regard for the bylaws; ""informality"" is being used to run roughshod over dissent.  Since we had a representative present (without me, his attorney), we probably lack standing to make a formal demand that the votes be rescinded until reintroduced under required conditions.  Otherwise, this e-mail would be asking you to join us.  However, as many involved on our end were quite upset, ""disenfranchisement"" could well become a matter for judicial review if it happens again to PacifiCorp.  I remain amazed that Small would push for revisions, such as those to 32.5, knowing there was substantial question over their legal effect.  If indeed Small's wrong on the law, we'd be fully prepared to demand undoing these changes due to flawed legal advice from Small and ""passage"" out of compliance with the bylaws, and to do so jointly with others.  In fact, if I get management okay, I'd be willing to write a joint objection to file with FERC in response to the introduced amendments.  There may even be some corporate doctrine under Utah law that prevents a non-profit from paying for Small's defense in an internecine dispute.  Although you are right that now is not the time for a joint WSPP/EEI drafting committee, I very much like the idea of proposing one under cover of a memo that picks out the highlights of convergence after the EEI process started against the type of amendments that were made before the EEI was on the table as a dramatic way to make the point that Small's agenda is to drive WSPP towards competition in a niche filled by the EEI, and hammer on the other points you've made, with which we fully agree.  I don't know that there's a need to do the convergence analysis exhaustively and academically, as opposed to persuasively, unless if you think you can convince a law stude nt on a local law review that it would make a good note.  I also note from the minutes that a Board of Trustees was elected; I do not recall being provided with a copy of the slate of nominees in advance of the meeting.  I admit I didn't spend a lot of time puzzling over it, but I don't see from the website or the bylaws the authority under which Small conducts the committee meetings.  It's interesting how the notes on the first day of the meeting appear to be written by someone who wasn't following the legal issues involved.  Let me know what you think on the FERC objection idea and whether you'd be prepared to join us.  ----- Original Message ----- From: ""Yoder, Christian"" <Christian.Yoder@enron.com> To: ""Stack, Shari"" <SStack@reliant.com>; <esager@enron.com>; <cyoder@enron.com>; ""Russo, Dianne H"" <drusso@reliantenergy.com>; <jeremy.weinstein@pacificorp.com> Sent: Wednesday, November 07, 2001 1:44 PM Subject: RE: Summary of WSPP Nov 1 and 2 meetings   Shari, I'm not sure of what to do about the informal, irregularity of the WSPP process.  I agree with you that there seems to be a lack of basic due process going on, but, it has always been difficult to understand how and why they do things the way they do.  History and personality seem to explain it best.   Right near the end of the Thursday session, I believe it was Jeremy Weinstein of PacifiCorp, tried to focus Mike on what to me seems to be a crucial, and potentially fruitful question:  Is the WSPP becoming more and more like the EEI, and if so, does anybody care?  Mike seemed to feel that there was a vast difference between the two agreements and that this vast difference mattered a lot.  I think if anybody would take the time to dispassionately examine the steady stream of changes that have been made to the WSPP over the past couple of years, the result would be that the two agreements would be seen to be converging rather than diverging. I would even take a further step and argue that the convergence has been so steady and effective, that the time has now arrived for a Joint EEI/WSPP Drafting Committee to harmonize the agreements. However, I think my suggestion is still premature.  At this moment in the process, it would seem that a comparative document, painstakingly showing each amendment of the WSPP agreement and what it looked like in comparison to the EEI needs to be created.  If convergence is what this objective study shows, then, at some point, the question fairly becomes:  why not get it over with and merge the documents?  Is a Joint Drafting Committee a good idea?  I may be wrong, and an academic look at my thesis is certainly required, but my instinct is that Mike's notion that a group-adopted agreement is fundamentally different than multiple bilateral agreements is a classic distinction without a difference.  Why does how the agreement is derived matter if the two agreements are becoming inexorably more and more alike? Why should I fly up and down the west coast attending a steady stream of meetings and pay $25K a year to use one agreement when it is steadily becoming more and more like the other agreement which involves neither inconvenience?  The creeping imitation of the WSPP process needs to be recognized for what it is. I would argue that this approach might bear more fruit than wrangling over process, although, that too is probably going to be an enduring necessity. ----cgy   -----Original Message----- From: Stack, Shari [mailto:SStack@reliant.com] Sent: Wednesday, November 07, 2001 12:19 PM To: esager@enron.com; cyoder@enron.com; Russo, Dianne H; jeremy.weinstein@pacificorp.com Subject: FW: Summary of WSPP Nov 1 and 2 meetings   I don't know who has had time to read the latest WSPP email  - but the provision below was NOT adopted in accordance with std. procedure. At the Contracting Committee meeting in Colorado Springs on Aug. 10- this provision did not get the requisite percentage to pass on to the Operating Committee (in the meeting summary, he noted that it got a ""supermajority"" - whatever that is.)  At the Operating Committee meeting in Idaho, Mike Small again proposed this change but said that there did not need to be a vote since it was going to be part of the ""operating procedures"". Now it appears that he has ""snuck"" it into the WSPP Agreement and took advantage of the fact that many did not attend the meeting in San Diego in reliance on being able to attend via conference call. As we all know, Mike Small arbitrarily canceled the call that would have allowed us to participate in the Executive Committee meeting. I suspect he did so because he knew we would object to this clause and therefore the 90% would not have been achieved.  Any thoughts on what to do about this??  S  _________________________________________________________   A new Section 32.5 to limit changes to the WSPP Agreement that may be made automatically through the confirmation process after the five day was adopted.  Under this new provision, non-standard confirmation provisions (e.g. changes to the basic terms of the WSPP Agreement) may be adopted only if there is explicit agreement to those changes and not by operation of the five day rule.  The modification adopted at the Executive Committee was to limit the oral agreements allowing such modifications to transactions of less than one week.  This provision as modified was adopted with only one dissenting vote.  >  -----Original Message----- > From: WINNIE HOWARD [mailto:HOWARD@wrightlaw.com] > Sent: Wednesday, November 07, 2001 9:45 AM > To: Russo, Dianne; Stack, Shari > Subject: Summary of WSPP Nov 1 and 2 meetings > >  <<WSPP 11-1 & 2-01 MEETINGS IN SAN DIEGO.doc.doc>>   ********************************************************************** This e-mail is the property of Enron Corp. and/or its relevant affiliate and may contain confidential and privileged material for the sole use of the intended recipient (s).

I have some leads on camping if you still think that is a good idea. Debbie sent me the following information. There are websites for them also, but I have not checked.   I don't know much about Cleveland, Texas although the fact that is close must mean it can't be that pretty (close is likely better, however, given that we will only have the weekend).  The last time we went camping we stayed at Chain O'Lakes in  Cleveland. They have all different kinds of cabins (very fancy to very  rustic), horses, hayrides and only an hour away.  The number is  281-592-2150.  We also stay at Neal's Lodges in Concan which is about 4 hours away. The cabins are not as fancy -- horses, hayrides, pool, cheap.

"Liz   Agreed that all parties would review the proposed framework with traders to try to ""fill in the boxes"". It was however recognised that there were difficulties in interpreting what was intended by the proposed RTO's and the relationship with the current Into Cinergy market.   AEP viewed that purchase of transmission was the critical area, who had to purchase what and several scenarios to work through. Whether Seller buys a wheel, whether buyer buys a wheel, or under MISO both parties buy a  wheel. This clearly has knock on effect for obligations in respect of firm and non-firm transmission and curtailment. In particular, what if non-firm is elected and how this flows through into obligations of the parties to a transaction.   Perception that the framework prepared by AEP will start all interested parties in the same place to talk about the issues.    It was agreed to try to get a representative from Duke to join the next call as they were an Into Cinergy product trader as well.   The next call was scheduled for November 29th at 10 o clock Eastern time. It was suggested that everyone at least take first page of Mitch's schedule and talk to the traders, since this would probably the best starting point, Mitch encouraged any comments to be shared earlier if possible.

"thanks   Elizabeth Sager 713-853-6349   -----Original Message----- From:  Nettelton, Marcus   Sent: Monday, November 19, 2001 5:09 PM To: Sager, Elizabeth Subject: RE: Conference Call re: Transition of Into Product to MISO Importance: High Sensitivity: Confidential  Liz   Agreed that all parties would review the proposed framework with traders to try to ""fill in the boxes"". It was however recognised that there were difficulties in interpreting what was intended by the proposed RTO's and the relationship with the current Into Cinergy market.   AEP viewed that purchase of transmission was the critical area, who had to purchase what and several scenarios to work through. Whether Seller buys a wheel, whether buyer buys a wheel, or under MISO both parties buy a  wheel. This clearly has knock on effect for obligations in respect of firm and non-firm transmission and curtailment. In particular, what if non-firm is elected and how this flows through into obligations of the parties to a transaction.   Perception that the framework prepared by AEP will start all interested parties in the same place to talk about the issues.    It was agreed to try to get a representative from Duke to join the next call as they were an Into Cinergy product trader as well.   The next call was scheduled for November 29th at 10 o clock Eastern time. It was suggested that everyone at least take first page of Mitch's schedule and talk to the traders, since this would probably the best starting point, Mitch encouraged any comments to be shared earlier if possible.   Signed you up for this call in your absence.

"   -----Original Message----- From:  Brown, Kortney   Sent: Monday, November 19, 2001 5:25 PM To: Mann, Kay Cc: Jafry, Rahil; Ngo, Tracy; Radous, Paul Subject: FW: Cogentrix  Kay & Rahil:  Just to make my position clear, if legal determines that an EEI is still necessary with this counterparty then we should go forward with pursuing an EEI agreement.  The credit position is that if the deal needs to get done soon, then let's just use the GTCs and we can follow up later with an EEI (if deemed necessary by legal).  If we can wait a couple of weeks, then let's go forward with negotiating an EEI now.  Hopefully this clarifies our position.  Sorry for the confusion.  If the later is the case, then Rahil, I will need to get financial statements from the counterparty and review.  Thank you.  Kortney   -----Original Message----- From:  Brown, Kortney   Sent: Monday, November 19, 2001 4:26 PM To: Jafry, Rahil Cc: Ngo, Tracy; Radous, Paul Subject: RE: Cogentrix  Pursuant to the Cogentrix Eastern Carolina, LLC transaction described in this email and your later draft term sheet, credit has determined that an EEI does not need to be in place with the counterparty and that we would be able to transact under the long-confirm form.  To provide a little bit of explanation for you:  A Master EEI is preferable when the counterparty is planning on doing long-term, large volume transactions.  Therefore, we have very specific terms and conditions that do not have as much ambiguity as within the GTCs.      In terms of unit contingent or interruptible power - credit would like to get a clear definition of whether the cp is sleeving ""unit contingent"" power versus ""interruptible"" power, since there are varying degrees of risk inherent in the two separate transactions and we would like to gain an understanding of the term and type of power this will be.    Thanks Rahil.

Cogentrix.  Please let me know if you have any more.  - R  Power could be sold on a Day-Ahead or an Hourly basis. They will give us a flat bogie and we will use that in our decision making. Kenansville is a coal-fired, 30MW, plant. We will be selling power at their bus point.  Any transmission cost, if/when incurred, will be treated on a pass-through basis. The Min-Max decision on the number of MW's is their operational decision, and we will let them decide once we send them a draft of the revised contract.   -----Original Message----- From:  Mann, Kay   Sent: Monday, November 12, 2001 5:52 PM To: 'Jafry, Rahil' Subject: RE: Cogentrix  Day ahead only?  How do we work together to set the bogie? I know on the MDEA deal there was an agreement on how it was calculated, including an agreement re the heat rates of the various units.   Is this a gas only facility?   How do we handle the transmission costs, or will we be selling the power at the same spot they are delivering it?  Are there minimum units of energy they will start their facility up for?  Thanks,  Kay     -----Original Message----- From:  Jafry, Rahil   Sent: Monday, November 12, 2001 5:39 PM To: Mann, Kay Subject: RE: Cogentrix  We'll be marketing power from their Kenansville plant on a unit contingent basis.  Together, we will establish a bogie price (their marginal cost of generation), and any value we can get them above this bogie price will earn us 25% of the extra upside we manage to get them.  They have a right to terminate with a 30-day notice and/or sell their power to other third parties at anytime.  - R    -----Original Message----- From:  Mann, Kay   Sent: Monday, November 12, 2001 4:59 PM To: Jafry, Rahil Subject: Cogentrix  Getting warmer.

"I agree that Netco will also need to use WSPP and we should anticipate responding accordingly.  For general conversation, though I still think we should recommend EEI.  As we open up for contracting, I think Christian, Steve and I will be able to quickly identify those Caps who will only use WASP.

"Status of Grant PUD Termination  EPMI has a WSPP Master Agreement with the Grant Public Utility District (""Grant ""PUD"").  Grant PUD terminated this agreement with EPMI on December 13, 2001.  All transactions were for physical power, and were documented and confirmed under the WSPP agreement.  Pursuant to a pre-petition agreement, at least two of the deals were converted to a cash payment and the physical delivery obligation was cancelled.  Grant calculated the termination payment as being $16,454,632.  On December 18, 2001, Grant paid this amount to Enron Account No. 40781075.  Our forward curves show that Grant still owes us approximately $450,000.   We are working with Grant PUD to ""true up"" the termination payment, and we expect to reach an agreement soon on the true-up payment.

EEI Collateral Annex, including paragraph 10, for use with the Master Agreement EEI;  3.  GTC EEI, Online with credit terms (unilateral right to call for collateral at any time for any reason), for use as the default GTCs Online when dealing with CPs with whom there will be a credit requirement (but could also be used for trades entered into orally assuming we secure the CP consent to the form of agreement, including cover page, prior to entering into trade);  4.

"Liz -- I've been unable to discuss this with Doug, as he's been out of the = office. I'm not even sure if he's terribly interested in this product being=  promulgated -- the UBSWenergy ERCOT products he will first offer are confi= ned to specific zones.  This product definition would presumably be used to=  support a ""Seller's  choice"" ERCOT-wide product spanning the four current = zones, and the Market Clearing Price (""MCP"") applicable would be in that zo= ne the Seller specified day-ahead. (That is, there are several moving parts=  to this.) The denomination 'Hourly Firm' was also a matter I wished to exp= lore with him.  Attached is a markup with my thoughts on the draft product,=  and this morning I'm going to talk to some other folks who might have a re= ad on the operation of the MCP in relation to the LDs calcualtion.  Please = note that if one specifies that the MCP is the cap on the Replacement Price= , then a presumption is being made that no additional costs are being incur= red in purchasing substitute product.  I think this is an acceptable assump= tion but Doug may think different.   The corrections on the attachment incl= ude some intended merely to use the defined terms actually stated in the Pr= otocols.  The changes in the second paragraph are intended to reverse any i= mplication that the settlement on LDs would be held open a month or even 6 = months until a final MCP value is identified by ERCOT -- I'd confine the wi= ndow for recalculation to one month. --DP =20 =20 =20 =20  -----Original Message----- From: Sager, Elizabeth=20 Sent: Wednesday, January 30, 2002 5:57 PM To: Portz, David Subject: FW: Final ERCOT Physical Hourly Firm LD Definition   David  - can you review and let me know your thoughts (there is an EEI meet= ing next Tues to discuss collateral annex and dede is proposing to also dis= cuss this.  thanks  -----Original Message-----=20 From: ""Tillett, Nina"" <NTillett@reliant.com>@ENRON on behalf of ""Russo, Dia= nne"" <DRusso@reliant.com>=20 Sent: Wed 1/30/2002 4:07 PM=20 To: Andy Katz (E-mail); Babak Pooya (E-mail); David Perlman (E-mail); Ed Co= mer (E-mail); Sager, Elizabeth; Fritz Henze (E-mail); Murphy, Harlan; J.
