"Phil,  I have been really busy the last couple of weeks. Well, come to think of it I have been really busy ever since I started this job. Yesterday, I was in Town and Country at 7:30 a.m. then straight to Edna, Texas by 11:00 a.m then straight to the Woodlands by 2:30 p.m. and got back to the house last night about 8:30 p.m. That has been a pretty typical day when in Houston, and this morning I was up at 4:00 a.m. to catch the first flight into Austin. Thankfully, the hard work and long hours are paying off. I have closed 3 or 4 deals now on my own and am further along then they expected me to be at this point, so I will be in Houston on a more full-time basis in the next couple of weeks. I will be in Houston on my own all next week ( July 4th week). By the end of July I should only be in Austin on Monday's, as a day trip, and then in Houston the rest of the week.

"I talked with all of you about having a monthly poker/cards game.  Please let me know if you are not interested anymore.  We discussed, a Thursday night once a month.  I was thinking from roughly 7:30 - 10 p.m.  How does the third Thursday of the month sound to everyone?  This should always keep us out of bidweek/first of the month scenarios.  Right now we have 8 guys, so we can go two tables.  We were also talking about rotating the location each month to someone else's house.  I will volunteer my house for the first week.  Do we want to start in September?  The third Thursday would be September 20th.  We also talked about this being a small time game, like .25 ante, $1.00 maximum.  Please let me know what you guys think if we can do this and if we should change some of the suggestions listed above.  Thanks.

Barbara Lee a representative from California's 9th district(Oakland, Berkeley) voted against the resolution.  The final vote was 424-1.  The senate voted 98-0(2 members unable to get to Washington).  Barbara Lee has a history of doing this, she was also the only one who voted in '99 not to respond to the bombing of the US embassies in Africa.  She also was involved in trying to disrupt the confirmation process of President Bush(Al Gore had to tell her to refrain from speaking several times while certifying the electoral college votes).  If you would like to write her or call her to let her know your feelings, the phone number in DC is 202-225-2661 and in Oakland is 510-763-0370.  Her fax numbers are (DC) 202-225-9817 and 510-763-6538(Oakland).  I tried by phone, but every person in her offices' voice mailbox was full(probably full of outraged citizens).  So I faxed her a letter.  I urge you IF you are also offended by her vote, a slap in the face to all Americans and anyone who knew someone who lost their life in this tragedy, to call or fax a letter.  Representative Lee needs to know that she represents all Americans, not just the ones in her district.  Her email address is barbara.lee@mail.house.gov.  I also urge you if you were offended to watch the news, she will be up for reelection in 2004 and look for her opponents, Democrat and Republican.    Whether you agree or not, you should make your voice heard.

Thou shall not rent 'Chocolat'.   2. Under no circumstances may 2 men share an umbrella.   3. Any man who brings a camera to a bachelor party may be legally killed and eaten by his fellow partygoers.   4. When you are queried by a buddy's wife, girlfriend, mother, father, priest, shrink, dentist, accountant, or dog walker, you need not and should not provide any useful information whatsoever as to his whereabouts. You are  permitted to deny his very existence.    5. Unless he murdered someone in your immediate family, you must bail a friend out of jail within 12 hours.   6. You may exaggerate any anecdote told in a bar by 50 percent without recrimination; beyond that, anyone within  earshot is allowed to call bullshit. (Exception:  When trying to pick up a girl, the allowable exaggeration rate rises to 400 percent)   7. If you've known a guy for more than 24 hours, his sister is off-limits forever.   8. The minimum amount of time you have to wait for another guy who's running late is 5 minutes. For a girl, you are required to wait 10 minutes for every point of hotness she scores on the classic 1-10 scale.   9. Bitching about the brand of free beer in a buddy's refrigerator is forbidden. You may gripe if the temperature is unsuitable.   10. No man is ever required to buy a birthday present for another man. (In fact, even remembering a friend's birthday is strictly optional.)   11. Agreeing to distract the ugly friend of a hot babe your buddy is trying to hook up with is your legal duty.  Should you get carried away with your good deed and end up having sex with the beast, your pal is forbidden to speak of it, even at your bachelor party.   12. Before dating a buddy's ex, you are required to ask his permission; and he, in return, is required to grant it.   13. Women who claim they ""love to watch sports"" must be treated as spies until they demonstrate knowledge of the game and the ability to pick a buffalo wing clean.   14. If a man's zipper is down, that's his problem  - you didn't see nothin'.   15. The universal compensation for buddies who help you move is beer.   16. A man must never own a cat or like his girlfriend's cat.    17. You girlfriend must bond with your buddy's girlfriends within 30 minutes of meeting them. You are not required to make nice with her gal pals' significant dick-heads --- low-level sports bonding is all the law requires.   18. When stumbling upon other guys watching a sports event, you may always ask the score of the game in progress, but you may never ask who's playing.   19. When your girlfriend / wife expresses a desire to fix her whiney friend with your pal, you may give her the go-ahead only if you'll be able to warn your buddy and give him time prepare excuses about joining the priesthood.   20. (Gas Warfare Act) you may flatuate in front of a woman only after you've brought her to climax. But, if you trap her head under the covers for the purpose of flatuent entertainment, she's officially your girlfriend.   21. It is permissible to consume a fruity chick drink only when you're sunning on a tropical beach...And it's delivered by a topless supermodel...and it's free.   22. Unless you're in prison, never fight naked.    23. A man in the company of a hot, suggestively dressed woman must remain sober enough to fight.    24. If a buddy is outnumbered, outmanned, or too drunk to fight, you must jump into the fight. Exception: If within the last 24 hours his actions have caused you to think, ""What this guy needs is a good ass-whoopin,"" you may sit back and enjoy.   25. Friends don't let friends wear Speedo's. Ever.  Issue closed.   26. Phrases that may NOT be uttered to another man while weight lifting: ""Yeah, baby, push it!"" ""C'mon, give me one more! Harder!""  ""Another set and we can hit the showers."" ""Nice ass, are you a Sagittarius?""   27. Never hesitate to reach for the last beer or the last slice of pizza, but not both.  That's just plain mean.   28. If you compliment a guy on his six-pack, you better be referring to his beer.   29. Never join your girlfriend / wife in dissings a buddy, except when she's withholding sex pending your response.   30. Never talk to a man in the bathroom unless you're on equal footing: Both urinating or both waiting in line. In all other situations, a nod is all the conversation you need.    31. If a buddy is already singing along to a song in the car, you may not join him  ...too gay.   32. Before allowing a drunken friend to cheat on his girl, you must attempt one intervention. If he is able to get on his feet, look you in the eye, and deliver a ""F@CK OFF!"" You are absolved of your of responsibility.   33. The morning after you and a babe who was formerly ""just a friend"" have carnal, drunken monkey sex, the fact that you're feeling weird and guilty is no reason not to nail her again before the discussion about what a big mistake it was.   34. In Black Jack, always split aces and eight's.  No arguments.     Chris K.

Subject: MGU Update  This is an update to keep you posted on recent changes:  The October start has been waved-off.  November is now the firm target.  Russell is planning to have the contract executed a week from today, Oct 5th.  The Mich vs ML7 and Consumers vs ML7 basis spreads have been moved back into the main body of the summary sheet.  We are going to use those tickets.  Geoff said to drop the two NYMEX fuel hedge tickets.  He is not going to put that hedge on with the NYMEX desk.  The contract language hasn't evolved in a manner that supports the 2nd and 3rd winter Mich and Consumers FPPrgm.  Therefore, that volume will revert from FPPrgm to Mich index sale.  The treatment of summer injection cost still has not been resolved.  If MGU agrees to bear that cost adjustments will be required to our Mich index sale ticket.  There's probably more but that's all that come to mind right now.  Let me know if you have any questions.  Louis R.

Subject: ERMS Bridge Programming Guidelines   In order to protect the integrity of TAGG production bridging logic and better facilitate development and improvements to EOL bridge functionality, the ERMS IT team has set forth some guidelines for the processing and prioritization of bridging development requests. These guidelines should assist both Risk Management and Commercial in gaining resolution on critical bridging issues while protecting against the implementation of faulty or untested logic.   The new process flow for ERMS bridging requests and corrections is as follows:   1) All requests for bridge logic corrections and enhancements will need to be forwarded by email through the EOL Product Control Group and should be prioritized as either ""Immediate"" or ""standard"". ""Immediates"" are emergency requests for which other programming efforts being made by the ERMS IT team will be placed on hold, while ""standard"" requests will be placed on ERMS's developmental time-table in the order received.       ** Note: Tara Sweitzer will be sending a supplemental email to the various Risk groups of current programming issues for prioritization.   2) Once received, developmental requests will be evaluated by the ERMS IT team. The programmers responsible for logic implementation will then assign an estimated completion date, which PCG will forward back to the appropriate Risk Desk. Any system issues, emergency requests or other subsequent developments which may impact this due date will be communicated to the appropriate Risk group by PCG.   3) Upon completion of testing, the ERMS IT team will load new logic enhancements and fixes into the production environment. These uploads will take place each Friday evening, except in the case of emergency requests, which may be uploaded at any time. This standardized weekend upload will correspond with the weekly EOL application enhancement uploads.   Please feel free to contact either myself or Tara Sweitzer if you have any questions regarding the new development request procedures.

As most of you already know, it has been a crazy weekend for some of us.  I'm going to address why all this happened, what we have done, and the ongoing problems we are having?  About 8 months ago Martin Cuilla took a position on a curve called GD-AECOUSD-DAIL.  On Friday he wanted to move this position to another curve called GD-AECOCD/FRWKD.  We had being seeing the position come in on the bench report but apparently VaR was not being captured on it.  It was not in the Primary/Secondary curve mapping table in Risktrac and was not mapped to an intra-month curve either (OMICRON).    On Friday evening I asked Burton to map the new curve in the primary /secondary table and Virendra to map it to OMICRON_9.  If this would have worked we expected Cuillas VaR to fall by approx. $800K given the risk structure of his positions.  But the desired results were not achieved.    On Saturday with the help of Ramesh, Virendra and Burton we tried several different combinations of mappings with no positive results.  The positions do not seem to be coming in as we are not picking up the book in Component Var.  The book should be INTRA-ONTARIO-CAD2.  It exists but, there are no positions in it.    The only reason this would happen if the curve had no Volatilities or Prices associated with it.  We need to find out why this is so?  Understand also that AECOCD/FRWKD is a derived curve so it has no Prices and Vols of it's own but takes it from AECO-CDN/IM.  We have also mapped AECO-CDN/IM to CGPR-AECO/BASIS and to OMICRON_9 but still are not getting any changes.    Ramesh, Burton Virendra, and Bruce have all worked very hard this weekend, despite having other work related commitments, to try to resolve this, and have gone over and above what was expected of them.  But despite all our efforts this is still a problem that needs addressing.    Cuilla is very concerned about this because Lavorato is watching him.  I have to answer to him tomorrow and cannot use systems issues as an excuse.  I want us as a team to look at this tomorrow and in the short-run fix Cuillas VaR.  We also want curve mapping to become a more front-end solution (with very few users) because of their (the front office) knowledge of where the different curves need to be mapped.  Kam Keiser will help us with this.  In the long-run I don't want any of us to have to do this again and want to identify a solution.  Ramesh has rightly pointed out that this will take time and resources on his side.  Given the speed of the work in this place none of us have either extra time or resources but, we have to find a way and, most of all be patient while we address these issues.  Please understand that tomorrow may be a little hectic for all concerned parties but to be patient while we try to reach the root of the problem.  Nilay we will need your expertise about curve mappings, and OMICRONS, for this?    Thanks again for all your help this weekend.......

"FYI : When entering deals with Canada, please remember to have the counter parties in a financial deal to be ECC and Riskmantra and a physical deal it will be ENA to ECC. Also remember on gas daily out months(2 legs) that the book on the gas daily swap leg needs to be INTRA-CND-WE-GD not INTRA-CAND-WEST(this book is for basis piece).  ALSO: Please remember to check your new deals completely every day, this will help eliminate future OA variances.  Do not rely on your trader to catch mistakes.  Thanks.

"I think the confusion with this lies in the fact that last month we had the same issue and I thought you put these deals that are desk to desk in tagg back on my region.  These relate to fixed price lock ins with Peoples.  I think what happened last month happened again this month which is settlements and the risk person did not get the fixed price lock ins done until the following month.  We will have to try and work on this for this month.  The problem is that they can take their volumes on several deals and we have to wait until it is completely scheduled.  Sorry for the confusion.

"Here in lies the problem.  These fix price locks are not deal specific - rather counterparty specific.  Therefore, we can not modify prices until the end of the month when we know which deals flowed volumes and which did not.  This means we have to do this the last two days of the month along with all of the other things we are doing.  For every month since May - except September we have been able to do this.  It just so happens the one time we do not do it, we had the most locks.  The problems we had in previous months were due to liquidations hitting central that should have hit Chicago.

I think what happened last month happened again this month which is settlements and the risk person did not get the fixed price lock ins done until the following month.

"Once again, it appears we have changed a price desk deal without letting them know.  I hope everyone understands how bad this makes our entire team look.  This issue continues to be brought up in the staff meeting and we are always the cause of it.  This is the second time in less than a week and we have gone over this several times.  Next time this happens, someone is liable to get an exit early pass from the floor for good.  To keep this from happening we will now practice the following Rule: Anytime a price desk deal that involves the central desk needs to be changed, the person that runs the central book will not leave the floor until Errol or Joey tells you that there book is ok.

Emshwiller, Rebecca Smith an= d Jathon Sapsford  10/26/2001 The Wall Street Journal C1 (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)  Enron Corp. drew down about $3 billion, the bulk of its available bank cred= it lines, in a bid to restore confidence in its financial strength and liqu= idity.=20 Enron will use part of the money to offer to redeem about $1.85 billion of = outstanding commercial paper -- short-term corporate IOUs -- according to a=  person familiar with the matter, with the remainder providing the energy c= oncern with a cash cushion. Some observers believe the move is a pre-emptiv= e step by Enron to ensure that it had adequate liquidity should its access = to bank lines be interrupted. The person also said Enron was talking to its=  banks about a new, multibillion-dollar credit line. Enron insists its business operation and financial condition remain strong.=  But, ""when the market is reacting as irrationally as it has been the last = few days, we thought that cash was better than a commitment from a bank,"" s= aid an Enron spokesman. In a statement, the company's new chief financial o= fficer, Jeff McMahon, said that by drawing down the bank lines, ""we are mak= ing it clear that Enron has the support of its banks and more than adequate=  liquidity to assure our customers that we can fulfill our commitments.""=20 The move underscored the tumultuous conditions that have been sweeping over=  the Houston energy-trading concern in the past 10 days. Enron is the natio= n's largest energy trader and is a principal in nearly one-quarter of all e= lectricity and natural-gas trades. Yesterday, for example, Enron was involv= ed in about $4 billion of deals through its EnronOnline unit.=20 Since early last week, Enron's share price has plummeted 50%. Last week, it=  reported a $618 million third-quarter loss and a reduction in shareholder = equity of $1.2 billion. It also disclosed that the Securities and Exchange = Commission is conducting an inquiry into billions of dollars of transaction= s it did with entities connected to its former chief financial officer, And= rew S. Fastow, who was replaced Wednesday.=20 The draw-down of the credit facilities came as one rating agency, Fitch, pu= t Enron on review for a possible downgrade, while another, Standard & Poor'= s, changed Enron's credit outlook to negative from stable. Moody's Investor= s Service already has said it is looking at a possible downgrade of Enron. = In order to fall below investment grade, Enron's credit rating would have t= o fall several notches.=20 If that were to happen, however, a host of bad consequences could follow. T= ogether with the sharp decline in its stock price, a noninvestment-grade ra= ting would throw the company into default on obligations involving billions=  of dollars of borrowings. In that event, Enron could be forced to issue mi= llions of shares of stock to holders of that debt, diluting the value of ex= isting shares. At 4 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Enro= n was down six cents at $16.35.=20 Liquidity is a key issue for Enron, which handles energy-trading volumes mo= re than triple its next-biggest competitor, American Electric Power Co. Enr= on's EnronOnline Internet-based trading platform has transacted more than $= 884 billion of trades since it was created in November 1999.=20 The company's wildly successful wholesale unit has been dragged down by und= erperforming assets elsewhere in the company, chiefly the approximately $6.= 5 billion of international assets such as its Dabhol power project in India= . Raising cash and retiring debt largely is a timing issue. The cash needs = of its trading operation are immediate; it takes time to sell assets, parti= cularly in today's slower economy.=20 The company also is suffering from a string of disclosure controversies tha= t have damaged its credibility, particularly in connection with its dealing= s with Mr. Fastow, the former chief financial officer. Internal documents r= elated to one of the Fastow partnerships disclose that Enron also did as mu= ch as hundreds of millions of dollars of business with an entity connected = to another company official, who has since left Enron. While Enron disclose= d its Fastow-related transactions in SEC filings, a computerized search of = the SEC's database of public filings produced no reference to this other em= ployee-related entity known as Chewco.=20 Chewco was established in 1997 ""with approximately $400 million in capital = commitments"" to buy an interest in Enron assets, according to one of the pa= rtnerships documents. The document didn't further specify what assets were = purchased, and it didn't disclose the financial impact of the transactions = for either Chewco or Enron. Chewco was being run by Michael Kopper, a manag= ing director in Enron's Global Equity Markets Group, according to the docum= ent.=20 Enron, which has maintained that its complex financial transactions with em= ployee-related entities were legal and properly disclosed, didn't have any = comment regarding its dealings with Chewco.=20 Mr. Kopper, who Enron says left the company this year to focus on helping t= o run the Fastow-related partnerships, didn't return phone calls. A person = at his office in Houston yesterday said Mr. Kopper was traveling. In respon= se to questions about Chewco, an Enron spokesman would say only that ""Micha= el Kopper was never an executive officer of Enron."" Mr. Fastow repeatedly h= as declined interview requests. He severed his relationships with the partn= erships in July.=20 This statement is an apparent reference to SEC disclosure regulations regar= ding related-party transactions. Under SEC rule S-K, a company has to repor= t any transaction that exceeds $60,000 and involves ""any director or execut= ive officer."" By contrast, Mr. Fastow, as CFO, would have fallen into that = category, but Mr. Kopper, as managing director of a business unit, presumab= ly wouldn't have.=20 However, reporting guidance issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Bo= ard seems to have a broader definition, one that might include Mr. Kopper. = According to FAS Statement 57, a related-party transaction involves a ""mate= rial"" piece of business between the company and a member of management. The=  statement defines management as directors, top officers, vice presidents i= n charge of major business units and ""other persons who perform similar pol= icy-making functions. Persons without formal titles may also be members of = management.""  Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Officials at Enron Corp., whose unusual transactions with its chief financi= al officer are under regulatory scrutiny, have steadily sold sizable amount= s of their holdings of company stock as the share price has fallen this yea= r.=20 Corporate officials had sold 1.8 million shares valued at about $106 millio= n through July, as the stock fell to less than $45 a share from $83 at the = start of the year. Since July, the stock has plummeted an additional 63% to=  $16.35, including a 50% plunge since the beginning of last week. Kenneth Lay, chief executive of the Houston energy-trading company, cashed = in shares for $25.7 million so far this year, usually in transactions paire= d with options exercises. He sold 429,614 shares, leaving him with some 2.8=  million shares as of July, the latest data available on his sales, accordi= ng to Thomson Financial/Lancer Analytics.=20 The dollar amount for his 2001 sales is approaching the total for all Mr. L= ay's sales of Enron shares for 2000, which reached $30.7 million. In 1999, = he sold shares for a total of $26 million.=20 In Houston, an Enron spokeswoman declined to comment on the figures, saying=  the company doesn't keep a running tally of stockholdings by corporate off= icials. Enron also wouldn't comment on the number of options held by compan= y insiders and called the sales ""a personal decision."" Many sales by Enron = insiders were concurrent with options exercises or sales followed soon afte= r option exercises.=20 Strong selling by company officers and directors amid share-price declines = should raise red flags for investors, says Jonathan Moreland, research dire= ctor of InsiderInsights.com, who uses insider-trading data to zero in on in= vestment ideas.=20 Among other insiders selling during the year, Kenneth Rice, former chairman=  and CEO of Enron's broadband unit, sold shares for $23.7 million. Mr. Rice=  has sold 456,966 shares of the 1.5 million shares he was listed as owning = in Enron's March proxy filing. Former Enron Chief Executive Jeffrey Skillin= g -- who resigned in August -- sold 160,000 shares for $9.8 million during = the year. In March, Mr. Skilling owned 1.9 million shares.=20 Messrs. Rice and Skilling couldn't be reached to comment.=20 Overall, Enron's insiders were busier selling shares last year, when they s= old 5.8 million shares for about $449 million. During 1999, insiders sold 3= .4 million shares for $123.1 million.=20 Since December 1999, only one Enron executive has reported buying company s= hares. The buyer was Andrew Fastow, who was ousted during the week as Enron= 's chief financial officer after the company disclosed it was under a Secur= ities and Exchange Commission investigation into financial ties between the=  company and Mr. Fastow.=20 Mr. Fastow reported purchasing 10,000 Enron shares in August at $36.98 each= , or a total of $369,800. Today, those shares are valued at $163,500, based=  on Enron's stock price of $16.35 in 4 p.m. New York Stock Exchange composi= te trading. After the purchase, Mr. Fastow owned 110,586 shares, Thomson Fi= nancial/Lancer Analytics says.=20 Enron said Mr. Fastow wasn't available to comment.=20 On Monday, a New York law firm filed suit in U.S. District Court in Houston= , alleging that Enron misrepresented its performance by failing to disclose=  problems with its broadband division and failing to properly write down th= e value of investments in limited partnerships managed by Mr. Fastow. The s= uit, which seeks class-action status, also says Enron insiders sold $73 mil= lion of their own Enron holdings during parts of 2000 and 2001.  Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. =09  Credit Markets Enron's Financial Troubles Reverberate to Bonds With Poor Liquidity and Cre= dit-Rating Concerns By Jathon Sapsford and Suzanne McGee Staff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal  10/26/2001 The Wall Street Journal C15 (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)  NEW YORK -- Enron Corp.'s bonds have held up better than its battered stock=  amid escalating financial woes at the energy-trading powerhouse.=20 Not for long, some bond traders say. In trading yesterday, the Houston company's five-year bond, a $250 million = issue due in July 2006 carrying a coupon of 6.4%, was quoted at 82 cents on=  the dollar, down from a bid of 88 late Wednesday, and representing a 16% d= rop during the past two weeks.=20 That is far less than the 50% decline in Enron's stock price since the Oct.=  16 disclosure of a $1.01 billion charge linked to soured investments, resu= lting in a $618 million third-quarter loss. But the fall in the bond's pric= e translates to a yield of 7.7 percentage points above bellwether U.S. gove= rnment bonds, which is a widening from about three percentage points two we= eks ago. Although Enron still is an investment-grade credit, that kind of ""= spread"" is more characteristic of a junk bond with a credit rating of singl= e B or lower.=20 Enron sought to assure the markets that its finances were sound, disclosing=  late yesterday that it drew down more than $1 billion on its bank credit l= ines to shore up its finances. Yet even as Enron was tapping its lifeline, = investors were finding it difficult to trade big blocks of Enron bonds. Yes= terday's 82 bid, for instance, was for a block of less than $2 million in b= onds, a small percentage of a typical trade.=20 Fueling the uncertainty surrounding Enron were fears that credit-rating con= cerns will lower ratings on Enron debt after it recently conceded a slew of=  troubles, including losses, a Securities and Exchange Commission investiga= tion, and the sudden resignation of its chief financial officer.=20 ""Even at these levels, there's very little buying interest,"" said Harold Ri= vkin, a principal at distressed-debt trader H. Rivkin & Co. in Princeton, N= .J.=20 In one sign of the ripple effects, the price investors pay to protect thems= elves from losses on Enron debt was surging. The cost of a ""default swap"" -= - in which an investor pays another investor to take a chunk of debt at fac= e value in the event of default -- rose to 10% of the size of the credit be= ing insured. That was up from 8% a day earlier, and more than holders of Lu= cent Technologies Inc. debt had to pay at the height of that technology com= pany's troubles earlier during the year.=20 Even with its woes, Enron remains an investment-grade company. Most credit-= rating agencies rate Enron's senior unsecured debt at several notches above=  the noninvestment-grade level.=20 Yet Fitch said yesterday it put Enron's credit rating on watch for a possib= le downgrade, following a similar move by Moody's Investors Service last we= ek. (Standard & Poor's, a division of McGraw Hill Cos., stopped short of pu= tting the company on its Creditwatch list, opting instead to revise its lon= g-term ratings outlook to ""negative,"" citing concerns about the company's f= inancial flexibility.)=20 Meanwhile, the weak bond prices are a sign that the markets are bracing for=  the worst. ""These are investment-grade bonds that are migrating toward dis= tressed levels,"" said Glenn Reynolds, an analyst at Credit Sights Inc., an = independent fixed-income research firm in New York. ""They aren't distressed=  yet, but they are headed in that direction.""=20 If Enron's credit ratings fall, it would have implications far beyond the c= ompany's ability to raise money. For an energy trader, a credit downgrade s= ends a signal to other participants in crucial markets about its ability to=  make good on its commitments.=20 Enron makes markets in a variety of commodities. Though it is best known fo= r trading electricity and natural gas, the company also is a huge force in = the markets for other commodities such as lumber, metals, bandwidth capacit= y and steel. As a market maker matching buyers and sellers, Enron handles a= bout a quarter of all the trading in the nation's energy and gas markets.= =20 Enron's credit-worthiness is hugely important. The better its credit rating= , the cheaper it can hedge, or offset, its positions in all these commoditi= es markets through derivatives and pass on savings to customers. Without th= at credit rating, the cost of this high-margin, high-volume business starts=  to rise. A derivative is an instrument whose value is linked to, or derive= d from, that of an underlying security or asset, such as a stock, bond or c= ommodity.=20 ""Even if the company does retain its investment-grade rating, the perceptio= n that this might be at risk will start to affect their core businesses,"" s= aid Mr. Reynolds at Credit Sights Inc. ""Any prudent risk [manager] at Enron= 's counterparties"" -- any institution on the other end of a financial agree= ment with Enron -- ""is going to be examining their exposure to Enron, and l= ooking for ways to minimize it or offset it,"" Mr. Reynolds said.=20 To be sure, Enron, despite its recent woes, remains a strong company, credi= t analysts said. ""I don't think anyone's seriously thinking that this is a = company that would ever default,"" Mr. Reynolds said.=20 ""So far, our research shows that their counterparties and their banks are s= ticking with them,"" said Ron Barone, managing director of Standard & Poor's=  utility energy project finance group. ""No one has cut credit lines or aske= d for additional collateral that we have identified. And customers have pub= licly stated that it's business as usual.""=20 Yet analysts say the arrival of distressed-debt traders on the scene could = make life more difficult for Enron and its management. Traders expect Enron= 's new Chief Financial Officer Jeffrey McMahon and Chairman Kenneth Lay to = make the rounds of Wall Street next week, meeting with rating agencies, deb= t-trading desks, big bond holders and banks, including J.P. Morgan Chase & = Co. and Citigroup Inc.=20 Treasurys=20 Treasurys rallied on optimism that the Federal Reserve may cut interest rat= es more than previously expected after a spate of economic reports that doc= umented how weak the economy was after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.=20 Prices also gained as the market finished digesting the week's flood of Tre= asury, corporate and agency debt issues.=20 At 4 p.m. EDT, the benchmark 10-year Treasury note was up 13/32 point, or $= 4.0625 per $1,000 face value, at 103 20/32. Its yield fell to 4.537% from 4= .588% Wednesday, as yields move inversely to prices.=20 The 30-year Treasury bond's price was up 22/32 point at 101 11/32 to yield = 5.284%, down from 5.330% Wednesday.=20 Fed policy makers are slated to meet on Nov. 6.

Enron: Rarely have so many analysts liked a stock they concede they know so=  little about.=20 In recent years, Wall Street researchers have been overwhelmingly -- critic= s would say blindly -- enthusiastic about Enron, even as they acknowledge n= ot always understanding the complex financial transactions that accounted f= or its soaring profits. Now, Enron is reporting steep losses from some of i= ts most complicated transactions, which many on Wall Street still can't fig= ure out. In a research note Wednesday, Goldman Sachs analyst David Fleischer concede= d that scant corporate disclosure at the Houston energy trader makes it dif= ficult to value the company. The company's ""lack of disclosure and transpar= ency,"" he says, is ""a longstanding Enron hallmark.""=20 So is this a stock to avoid, in his view? Hardly. Goldman on Wednesday did = bump Enron off its ""U.S. Select List,"" which consists of a few dozen top st= ock picks -- but Mr. Fleischer continued to keep the stock on the firm's la= rger but prestigious ""Recommended List"" of 200 or so favored stocks, where = it has been since he joined Goldman in 1993.=20 ""Just because I can't be specific in being able to create a simple model . = . . doesn't mean that you write off that industry and say `I can't analyze = it' or `I can't figure it out,' "" says Mr. Fleischer, who owns an undisclos= ed number of Enron shares. ""If that were the case, there would be an awful = lot of industries we couldn't follow.""=20 Enron's shares have dropped about 50% since last week.=20 ""Every sell-side analyst we spoke to early in 2001 admitted that this was a=  black box,"" says Jim Chanos, principal of Kynikos Associates in New York, = who has been selling Enron stock short -- trading it with an eye to profiti= ng from its fall -- throughout this year. ""It was really a trust-me story, = when all the evidence was mounting that there was reason to question that l= evel of trust.""=20 True, no stock picker is immune from bad calls. And Wall Street analysts lo= ng have been criticized for their overwhelmingly bullish bias, particularly=  on stocks in hot sectors with lots of investment-banking deals to be had.= =20 But Enron stands apart, precisely because so many of the analysts still rec= ommending the stock have acknowledged that the company's disclosure practic= es are lacking. Which raises the question: How can an analyst recommend tha= t others purchase a stock when key information about the company's operatio= ns is so often either unavailable or indecipherable?=20 Concerns about the way that Enron runs its business aren't new. Many of the=  issues now plaguing Enron's stock were first raised more than a year ago b= y bearish hedge-fund managers and independent accounting experts. Yet time = and again, Wall Street analysts dismissed as unimportant many of the linger= ing questions about the company's various partnership transactions.=20 Besides those partnerships, Enron also has been dogged by concerns about th= e secretive valuation techniques it uses to record its assets and earnings.= =20 Through it all, most analysts have stuck by this onetime stock-market darli= ng, publicly dismissing questions about the firm's accounting practices and=  level of disclosure. As of yesterday, of the 17 analysts who following the=  stock, 10 had a ""strong buy"" or equivalent rating on the stock, according = to Thomson Financial/First Call. Five others rated the stock a ""buy,"" thoug= h not strongly.=20 Only Prudential Securities, which downgraded the stock this week, has a ""se= ll"" rating on Enron.=20 The bullish treatment is the latest and one of the most high-profile exampl= es of Wall Street taking a glass half-full stance, despite what in retrospe= ct seems to be ample warning that a less-enthusiastic approach was warrante= d.=20 Over the past year in the wake of the Nasdaq Composite Index's general coll= apse, analysts have been widely assailed for a lack of independence -- part= icularly those who, like Goldman's Mr. Fleischer, own shares in the compani= es they cover. Regulators have raised concerns that analysts have compromis= ed themselves to help their firms land lucrative investment-banking fees an= d other revenue.=20 Enron has spread the wealth across many Wall Street firms. For instance, fo= r one $865 million equity offering in 1999 led by `Credit Suisse First Bost= on, Enron retained seven co-managers, including Donaldson Lufkin & Jenrette= , Lehman Brothers and Merrill Lynch.=20 ""Enron is a big company, and I don't think you're going to find a firm that=  hasn't been involved,"" says Credit Suisse First Boston analyst Curt Launer= , who still rates the stock a ""strong buy"" with a $40 price target. ""They p= ay a lot of investment-banking fees to Wall Street.""=20 He adds, ""We do our analysis every day based on the information we have. Ar= e we here strictly to defend companies? That's ludicrous. We're here to pro= vide information to investors. . . . Yes, I have the wrong recommendation o= n the stock. I don't think my analysis has been as wrong as the stock has p= erformed.""=20 Mr. Fleischer, whose firm also has served as an investment banker to Enron,=  calls his holding ""a meaningful investment"" that is ""not small."" But he di= sputes any suggestion that his objectivity is compromised. Mr. Fleischer sa= ys his clients ""are happy to know"" he has a stake in Enron, because it show= s he puts his money where his mouth is.=20 In his research note Wednesday, Mr. Fleischer called for complete disclosur= es of Enron's off-balance sheet partnerships. Despite the resulting difficu= lty he acknowledged facing in developing financial models for the company, = he wrote that he and many other investors historically ""have given Enron th= e benefit of doubt because of its strong growth in earnings"" and position a= s an industry leader.=20 ""There's not information to really model this and be able to predict accura= tely where revenues are going to come from and where they're going to make = their money, but every quarter they do,"" he says. ""It's hard to get inside = to know all the transactions, but they do deliver.""=20 CSFB's Mr. Launer also has been a longtime defender of the company, occasio= nally issuing research reports to rebut critical stories about Enron in the=  financial press. On Monday, he wrote that he expects questions about Enron= 's partnerships and accounting disclosures to continue, but that he remains=  ""confident in the businesses and operating growth prospects for [Enron] an= d an ultimate recovery in the share price.""=20 ""I know I'm wrong on the stock,"" Mr. Launer says. But he says that at these=  prices, he isn't ready to throw in the towel because he figures that even = in a worst-case scenario -- under which he envisions Enron having to issue = as much as $2 billion worth of shares, diluting current holders -- the stoc= k doesn't have much further to fall.=20 Clearly, Messrs. Launer and Flesicher aren't alone. ""Even in relative terms= , analysts remain very bullish on this stock,"" says Chuck Hill, director of=  research at Thomson Financial/First Call. The average rating for a stock o= n Wall Street is 2.2, or slightly shy of a ""buy"" rating. Enron scores a 1.6= . ""This may turn into a classic case of locking the barn door after the bad=  news is out,"" Mr. Hill says.=20 In downgrading the stock this week, Prudential analyst Carol Coale bumped i= t to ""sell"" from ""buy,"" with a brief stop at ""hold."" While she is the only = analyst to recommend investors sell the stock, she openly concedes her rece= nt downgrades come ""too little, too late.""=20 Ms. Coale says Enron has been difficult to cover for years. She says the co= mpany's disclosure practices fall far short of ideal, and senior executives=  are often evasive, even when presented with direct questions. For instance= , she says three weeks ago she asked Enron management if the company was un= der investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission. They said ""no,= "" she says.=20 In light of the company's acknowledgment this week of an SEC ""inquiry,"" she=  asked Enron about the previous denial. ""They told me it is an inquiry, not=  an investigation,"" she says. An Enron spokeswoman says the company learned=  of the SEC's inquiry only last Wednesday.

The Houston-based company will use about $2.2 billion to pay off commercial paper obligations and keep the rest as cash, spokesman Mark Palmer said.       ``Nothing instils confidence like cash,'' he said.       Enron's shares have dropped 52 percent in the past 10 days as investors worry that the company's credit rating will be cut after $1.01 billion in third-quarter losses from failed investments. Enron needs good credit to raise cash daily to keep trading partners from demanding collateral and to settle transactions.       Investors say they are worried about $3.3 billion in liabilities from affiliates formed to buy and sell Enron assets. Enron ousted Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow on Wednesday amid a Securities and Exchange Commission inquiry into partnerships he ran that cost the company $35 million.       Jeff McMahon, head of Enron's industrial markets group, was named CFO in a bid to restore investor confidence, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Kenneth Lay said in a statement.       Enron shares fell 6 cents to $16.35 yesterday.  --Mark Johnson in the Princeton newsroom (609) 750-4662, or at    Enron Liked By Analysts Despite Complicated Dealings, WSJ Says 2001-10-26 06:12 (New York)       Houston, Oct. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp. is liked by many Wall Street analysts despite lingering questions about the power trading company's complicated partnership transactions and the techniques used to record earnings, the Wall Street Journal reported in its ``Heard on the Street'' column.       Goldman Sachs Group Inc. analyst David Fleischer, who owns an undisclosed number of Enron shares, said that even though inadequate corporate disclosure makes it difficult to value the company, that doesn't mean he will write off the industry or not analyze Enron.       Of the 17 analysts who follow the stock, 10 had a ``strong buy'' or equivalent rating, according to Thomson Financial/First Call, the paper said. Five rated it ``buy'' and one had a ``sell'' on Enron.       Most analysts have stuck by the company, publicly dismissing questions about Enron's accounting practices and level of disclosure, the Journal said.       The Securities and Exchange Commission is inquiring about partnerships run by former Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow.   Enron Draws Down $3 Billion From Its Credit Lines, WSJ Reports 2001-10-26 00:28 (New York)       New York, Oct. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp. drew down about $3 billion of its available credit, the bulk of its bank credit lines, to restore confidence in the financial strength of the company, the Wall Street Journal reported.       The energy trading company, whose shares have fallen 52 percent since Oct. 16, will use part of the money to redeem about $1.85 billion short-term commercial debt, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing an unidentified person familiar with the matter.       Enron is talking to banks about a new, multi-billion line of credit, the paper reported, citing the unidentified person. The steps are seen as an effort by the energy trader to ensure that it has adequate liquidity in case its access to bank credit is disrupted, the paper said.       Enron said in a statement distributed by PR Newswire that it drew on its credit lines to provide more than $1 billion in cash liquidity. The steps come a day after Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow resigned amid a Securities and Exchange Commission probe of partnerships he ran.  --William Selway in the San Francisco newsroom at (415) 743-3511,   Oct. 25, 2001, 11:22PM Houston Chronicle Action by Enron halts stock's fall=20 But credit ratings are being reviewed=20 By LAURA GOLDBERG=20 Copyright 2001 Houston Chronicle=20 The recent freefall of Enron Corp.'s stock price stabilized Thursday, a day=  after the world's largest energy trader replaced its chief financial offic= er.=20 Enron, under a cloud for a number of reasons, including an Securities and E= xchange Commission inquiry, also made two announcements Thursday night aime= d at reassuring the financial community.=20 In the announcements, Enron said it had drawn more than $1 billion from its=  lines of credit and said that energy-trading business done through EnronOn= line on Thursday was above average levels.=20 Houston-based Enron banked the money and has no plans to spend it, a spokes= woman said.=20 ""We are making it clear that Enron has the full support of its banks and mo= re than adequate liquidity to assure our customers that we can fulfill our = commitments in the ordinary course of business,"" Jeff McMahon, who took ove= r Wednesday as chief financial officer, said in a written statement.=20 Enron said it recorded more than 8,300 transactions through EnronOnline on = Thursday.=20 Ken Lay, chairman and chief executive officer, said: ""Enron continues to be=  the market-maker of choice in wholesale and gas power markets, our custome= rs continue to put their confidence in us, and our core businesses are stro= ng and performing well.""=20 Earlier Thursday, two credit rating agencies took actions regarding Enron's=  ratings, which J.P.

By FLOYD NORRIS  10/26/2001 The New York Times Page 1, Column 2 c. 2001 New York Times Company  CAN the new, friendlier Securities and Exchange Commission enforce the laws=  and assure investors that corporate financial reports are trustworthy?=20 Harvey L. Pitt, the new S.E.C. chairman, set out this week to show that he = is not like his predecessor, Arthur Levitt. In a speech to the American Ins= titute of Certified Public Accountants -- an organization whose senior lead= ership led a bitter and ultimately unsuccessful fight against Mr. Levitt's = reform efforts -- Mr. Pitt praised his listeners and took a few swipes at h= is predecessor.=20 From now on, he promised, ''the commission will make sound decisions, in a = respectful, affirmative way, not in a demeaning, demanding or demonizing wa= y.'' He spoke favorably of ''pro forma'' earnings reports, in ways that no = doubt heartened accountants who have worked so hard to find ways to make ev= en the worst profit figures look pretty. There was no mention of Mr. Levitt= 's concerns about improper management of earnings. On the heels of Mr. Pitt's speech, the S.E.C. used a minor enforcement acti= on to herald a policy of not cracking down on companies that come forward t= o report their own errors. The decision itself was reasonable, although one=  could wonder if top management did something wrong in failing to detect a = fraud that went on for years. But the way the S.E.C. trumpeted it raised qu= estions about whether the agency is turning into a friendly puppy rather th= an a guard dog. ''Is this amnesty for financial fraud?'' Jane Adams, the ac= counting analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston and a former S.E.C. staff me= mber, asked in a report to clients. She was not sure of the answer.=20 In an interview yesterday, Mr. Pitt dismissed such worries. ''No one is goi= ng to get away with anything,'' he said. ''What we are trying to do is crea= te an environment where people feel comfortable'' and can talk to the S.E.C= . ''without feeling we are looking for a big splash.''=20 A major embarrassment for accountants is having the S.E.C. force a client t= o restate its numbers. Mr. Pitt and his chief accountant, Robert Herdman, a= re sending signals that fewer such demands will be made. ''I am very much i= n favor of a vigorous enforcement program,'' Mr. Pitt said in the interview= , ''but I am not in favor of having investors barraged by conflicting state= ments and restatements.''=20 Mr. Pitt talks of companies ''getting it right the first time,'' which woul= d certainly be nice. But there is a risk that companies will become more ag= gressive in their accounting, figuring there will be no real penalty, like = a restatement, if they are caught. That would make life harder for auditors=  who try to resist misleading accounting.=20 In trying to sound comforting to the accountants' group -- an organization = that, as he noted, he had represented as a lawyer for two decades -- Mr. Pi= tt has done little to reassure investors of his independence.=20 The proof, of course, will come in the performance. Fortunately, the mess a= t Enron gives the S.E.C. a golden opportunity to counter the puppy image. I= t will take time for the commission to determine if the company's accountin= g was proper. But there need be no delay in forcing Enron to clearly explai= n -- rather than obfuscate as it has so far -- the strange deals it made wi= th partnerships run by the executive just ousted as chief financial officer= .=20 ''This could,'' a former S.E.C. staff member said, ''focus the issue on whe= ther companies can make completely correct but totally misleading disclosur= es.'' And it would indicate that this watchdog still has a bite.  Photo: Harvey L. Pitt=20 Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Swanson <mailto:kcswanson@thestreet.com> Staff Reporter 10/26/2001 07:08 AM EDT URL: <http://www.thestreet.com/markets/dumbest/10003035.html> TheStreet.com 1. United Airlines Just a Little Too Honest Rule No. 1 in CEO school: Never say that your company may soon collapse.=20 Seems kind of obvious, but that rule was flouted by United Airlines chief J= ames Goodwin, who warned in a letter to employees that the company ""will pe= rish"" next year unless it can stanch its tremendous losses, which have wors= ened since the terrorist attacks. ""Today, we are literally hemorrhaging mon= ey,"" he wrote.=20 In raising concerns about the financial viability of United, a unit of UAL = (UAL:NYSE - news - commentary) , Goodwin only put into words what outsiders=  have speculated about. Since Sept. 11, the airline has laid off about 20,0= 00 of its 100,000 employees and cut flights by as much as 25%. It's expecte= d to announce massive losses when it reports third-quarter earnings.=20 But in response to the disclosure, Goodwin has been roundly attacked. Feeli= ng that he had been all too honest, investors have knocked an additional 24= % off the stock's value. The shares are down 54% since Sept 11. Meanwhile, = UAL union leaders reportedly say Goodwin has exaggerated company difficulti= es to gain bargaining leverage in union negotiations. The leaders of one un= ion have petitioned the company's board of directors to have him sacked.=20 Bottom line: CEOs may get pilloried when they try to dodge the truth, but s= ometimes it doesn't pay to be too candid about worst-case scenarios, either= . Especially when that scenario is the company's own demise.=20 2. Forget the Victory Gardens; Let's Have a Comfortable War=20 Sure, we're at war with a band of cave-dwelling outlaws hell bent on our an= nihilation. But would all freedom-loving Americans please go out and buy so= me DVD players? Maybe even a nice new car?=20 That was basically the message from the Treasury Department, on news that C= ongress had voted for the creation of war bonds to finance antiterrorism ef= forts and rebuilding following the attacks. Officials at Treasury applauded=  the sentiment, then politely suggested it would be even better for the eco= nomy if Americans just went to stores and bought stuff. ""The economy is per= haps our greatest asset as we move forward in these efforts to fight the wa= r on global terrorists,"" says Betsy Holahan, a department spokesperson. ""Wa= r bonds are an additional way for Americans to show their patriotism.""=20 For the record, we don't think an issue of war bonds would be dumb, just su= perfluous. After all, nothing's stopped Americans from buying generic savin= gs bonds -- or better yet, Treasuries -- all of which finance spending by t= he federal government.=20 In the meantime, it's a little dislocating to hear politicians talk up war = bonds -- which most people associate with hardship and sacrifice -- at the = same time top economic gurus are practically begging people to shop. War bo= nds notwithstanding, we're a long way off from the era of ration books.=20 3. Enron Again Last week, we noted the extent of alarm about Enron's (ENE:NYSE - news - co= mmentary) revelation that its shareholder equity had dropped $1.2 billion, = following some unusual and possibly inappropriate high-level transactions. = Following that disclosure, besieged CFO Andrew Fastow has finally left the = company on what's delicately termed a ""leave of absence.""=20 In July, Fastow exited a limited partnership, from which he had reportedly = reaped large profits, after shareholders and analysts objected to his invol= vement.

Houston, Oct. 25 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp.'s long-term credit ratings outlook was changed to negative from stable by Standard & Poor's after the largest energy trader's shares fell 49 percent in the past week.       S&P affirmed the Houston-based company's ratings of ``BBB+/A2,'' which are investment grade.       The ratings company cited lost market capitalization and the possibility that Enron won't generate enough money from selling assets outside the main trading business to repay debt. S&P did say that ``the strategic direction of the company is likely to become more credit-positive in the wake of recent management changes.''       Enron reported $1.01 billion in losses from investments outside the principal business of trading commodities such as electricity and natural gas. Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow resigned yesterday as the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission asks for information about related-party transactions he conducted.       ``The S&P write up was very positive,'' said Dorothea Matthews, an analyst at CreditSights Inc., a research firm. ``It seems that the ratings company went out of its way to tray and calm things down.''       Shares of Enron fell 6 cents to $16.35.  --Russell Hubbard in the Princeton newsroom, 609-750-4651 or   Enron's Trading Partners Say It's Business as Usual (Update2) 2001-10-25 19:38 (New York)  Enron's Trading Partners Say It's Business as Usual (Update2)       (Adds new Enron CFO in 14th paragraph.)       Houston, Oct. 25 (Bloomberg) -- Concerns Enron Corp. will run short on cash haven't prevented commodities traders from doing business with the largest energy broker, customers say.       The company handles about 25 percent of U.S. power and natural-gas trading, said John Kilduff, vice president of energy risk management for Fimat USA. It's also a leader in complex derivatives that allow others to hedge against the risk of fluctuating commodities prices.       Enron's credit rating is on watch for possible downgrade at Moody's Investors Service, and Standard & Poor's lowered Enron's long-term credit outlook to negative after $1.01 billion in third- quarter losses from some soured investments. The company needs good credit to raise cash every day to keep trading partners from demanding collateral and to settle transactions.       So far, there are no signs that Houston-based Enron is handling less business, Kilduff said.       ``If they were unable to perform, it would be a major problem,'' he said. ``It could get like Long-Term Capital if things really broke down because the numbers are that big.''       Long-Term Capital Management, a private investment fund for the wealthy, incurred massive losses making bond trades during the 1998 Russian currency crisis. The fund's portfolio plunged. More than a dozen banks bailed out the fund at a cost of $3.6 billion to avoid a collapse.                           Needs Cash Daily       Enron trades electricity, natural gas, coal and other commodities worldwide, as well as complex financial instruments to hedge against price swings in the goods.       ``As of now, Enron is active in the markets,'' Kilduff said. ``No one is cutting trading lines that I can see, or demanding different terms than before.''       Companies that trade as heavily as Enron require cash every day to settle positions, said Kilduff, whose company swaps natural gas and other energy investments with Enron.       Some days, Fimat will bet that natural-gas prices will fall, while Enron bets that they will rise. Natural gas usually does one or the other every day, and someone pays the difference.       ``The liquidity of your trading partners is a risk factor,'' Kilduff said. ``Someone is paying someone else every day.''       Enron said on a conference call Tuesday that it has enough money to operate normally, and can fall back on $3.4 billion in bank credit lines if necessary. The company is determined to protect the credit rating, Enron has said.       ``We aren't even going to entertain worst-case scenarios at this point,'' said Enron spokeswoman Karen Denne.                          Investor Questions       Enron, based in Houston, ousted Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow yesterday, two days after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission began asking questions about partnerships he ran that invested in company shares. Those trades cost Enron $35 million. Jeff McMahon, head of Enron's industrial markets unit, replaced Fastow, who went on leave of absence.       Enron shares have fallen 49 percent in the past week. They fell 6 cents to $16.35 today.       Based on Bloomberg composite ratings, most of Enron's long- term debt is rated at BBB2 and BBB1, two or three levels above investment grade. Fitch, Standard & Poor's and Moody's all rate the company's debt at investment grade.       The company also faces questions from investors about $3.3 billion in potential liabilities from affiliated companies formed to buy and sell Enron assets such as power plants.       The affiliates owe payments to bond investors and plan to meet them by selling assets. Enron doesn't know if the sale proceeds will cover the debt. The company would have to make good on any shortfall.                              Little Time       Enron asked Citicorp Inc. on Tuesday to arrange a $750 million loan to ensure access to credit if the company gets shut out of the money markets.       Enron had about $1.85 billion of commercial paper, or short- term unsecured debt, outstanding as of Tuesday, traders said. The company, which has a $3 billion program, has had difficulty finding buyers for new commercial paper sales since the SEC investigation was announced, the traders said.       Today, Enron offered two-week commercial paper at a 3 percent yield, 10 to 15 basis points above comparably rated companies.       ``There appears to be enough liquidity to give them enough time to get their house in order,'' said Jon Kyle Cartwright, senior energy credit analyst at Raymond James & Associates. ``There's a point where a credibility crisis becomes a self- fulfilling prophecy, so they have less time than they think to pacify the market.''                             Ripple Effect       Some investors are concerned that Enron's complex book of hedges, swaps, options and other derivative contracts involves so many partners, participants and companies that a failure would pose a risk to the economy, and force a bailout like Long-Term Capital Management's.       ``The talk in the financial markets is that some counter party to Enron could fail if Enron can't perform,'' said Jeff Caughron, manager of $400 million in investments for Tinker Federal Credit Union in Oklahoma City. ``If it goes down, there could be a big ripple effect.''       The effect has already spread as investors worry Enron won't be able to pay bills owed to power producers such as Calpine Corp., Dynegy Inc., Mirant Corp. and NRG Inc., said Chris Ellinghaus, an analyst at Williams Capital Group. As a group, shares of the four have fallen 11 percent in the past week.       ``Rumors that these companies have receivables with Enron are fueling a sell-off,'' he said. ``Both traders and companies selling power to Enron are suffering.''       All four companies said they're trading with Enron as they have in the past.                           Market Maker       Enron supplies services some customers consider irreplaceable. The Sacramento Municipal Utilities District hedges weather risk through Enron, said risk manager Jim Tracy.       The district entered into an agreement that forces it to pay Enron if rainfall is abundant and hydroelectric dams can operate at peak efficiency and capacity; in dry seasons, when the dams can't operate as well, Enron pays the district.       ``If Enron's credit went bad, or they folded up, that agreement wouldn't get picked up by someone else,'' Tracy said.       Enron also helps many U.S. utilities protect themselves from electricity and natural gas price fluctuations in the same way it helps the Sacramento utility district hedge against too little rainfall. Any impairment on Enron's part to continue doing so would trickle down to Main Street utilities, Tracy said.       ``Utilities would start reserving more on their balance sheets for price swings,'' Tracy said.  --Russell Hubbard in the Princeton newsroom at 609-750-4651, or at   Enron Broadband Begins Closing London, Singapore Offices By Erwin Seba Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES  10/25/2001 Dow Jones Energy Service (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

Calpine is by far the biggest supplier under=  those contracts, which on a mark-to-market basis are worth far less now th= an when California bought this past winter and spring.=20 ""Nobody has come to us directly or indirectly with regard to the Calif cont= racts.

We've done that many times.""=20 As for future power prices, Calpine said that it's going forward with its p= rogram to build a portfolio of 70,000 megawatts of generation, which is abo= ut three times its current capacity and would be about 7% of all U.S. capac= ity. The critical determinant of profitability in power generation is the d= ifference between natural gas prices and power prices, and Calpine said tha= t difference, or ""spark spread,"" has grown the past few months. Furthermore= , the company executives said they are holding to a requirement that all pr= ojects generate an after-tax return of 18% on the investment.=20 As a result, the company expects earnings to grow at least 40% annually thr= ough 2005.

Files Class Action Suit Against Enron Corp= oration  10/25/2001 PR Newswire (Copyright (c) 2001, PR Newswire)  PHILADELPHIA, Oct. 25 /PRNewswire/ -- The law firm of Spector, Roseman & Ko= droff, P.C. announces that a class action lawsuit has been commenced in the=  United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas, Houston D= ivision, against defendants Enron Corporation (""Enron"" or the ""Company"") (N= YSE: ENE), Kenneth L. Lay, Jeffrey K. Skilling, and Andrew Fastow, on behal= f of purchasers of the common stock of Enron during the period between Janu= ary 18, 2000 and October 17, 2001, inclusive (the ""Class Period"").=20 The Complaint alleges that defendants violated Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of = the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder,=  by issuing a series of material misrepresentations to the market between J= anuary 18, 2000 and October 17, 2001, thereby artificially inflating the pr= ice of Enron common stock. Specifically, the complaint alleges that Enron i= ssued a series of statements concerning its business, financial results and=  operations which failed to disclose (i) that the Company's Broadband Servi= ces Division was experiencing declining demand for bandwidth and the Compan= y's efforts to create a trading market for bandwidth were not meeting with = success as many of the market participants were not creditworthy; (ii) that=  the Company's operating results were materially overstated as result of th= e Company failing to timely write-down the value of its investments with ce= rtain limited partnerships which were managed by the Company's chief financ= ial officer; and (iii) that Enron was failing to write-down impaired assets=  on a timely basis in accordance with GAAP. On October 16, 2001, Enron surp= rised the market by announcing that the Company was taking non-recurring ch= arges of $1.01 billion after-tax, or ($1.11) loss per diluted share, in the=  third quarter of 2001, the period ending September 30, 2001. Subsequently,=  Enron revealed that a material portion of the charge related to the unwind= ing of investments with certain limited partnerships which were controlled = by Enron's chief financial officer and that the Company would be eliminatin= g more than $1 billion in shareholder equity as a result of its unwinding o= f the investments. As this news began to be assimilated by the market, the = price of Enron common stock dropped significantly. During the Class Period,=  Enron insiders disposed of over $73 million of their personally held Enron=  common stock to unsuspecting investors. If you purchased Enron securities during the Class Period, you may, no late= r than December 21, 2001, move to be appointed as a Lead Plaintiff in this = class action.

Houston, Oct. 25 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp. prided itself on sharing the wealth with employees when the company was posting record profits last year. Now, from the boardroom to the mailroom, employees are sharing the pain.       Enron, the largest energy trader, grants stock options to the bulk of its 20,000 employees. Under Enron's standard compensation package, most employees get stock options equal to 5 percent of their annual base salary, spokeswoman Meredith Philipp said.       Employees held 46.8 million exercisable options as of the end of 2000, all at average prices above the company's current share price. The stock has dropped 80 percent this year.       ``Virtually every option is under water right now,'' Enron spokeswoman Karen Denne said.       Enron's board sets the strike price for the options in December or January. Employees can't cash the options in and make a profit unless the stock is trading above the strike price. At the end of 2000, Enron shares were trading at $83.13. In December, the board set a strike price of about $80.       Shares of Houston-based Enron fell 6 cents to $16.35 today. They have lost 37 percent of their value so far this week.       Enron said Monday that the Securities and Exchange Commission was asking questions about partnerships run by Andrew Fastow, who was ousted as Enron's chief financial officer yesterday. One partnership cost the company $35 million, and Enron bought back 62 million shares from a partnership at a cost of $1.2 billion.       Enron named Jeff McMahon, head of its industrial markets group, as CFO late yesterday.                           Unvested Options       Another 96.1 million options granted to Enron employees hadn't vested as of the end of last year. About 15.4 million of them, or 16 percent, were at prices ranging from $6.88 to $20 a share. The rest vest at levels well above the current share price.       Experts who have watched the devaluation of stock options in other industries, such as technology and telecommunications, say it becomes demoralizing for workers to watch share prices fall below their options.       ``It looks bad,'' said Mark Edwards, chairman of IQuantic Buck, a Mellon Financial Corp. unit that provides compensation consulting. ``Employees look at (the stock price) every day, and it's a continued disincentive to them.''       While Denne said Enron doesn't have any plans to reprice its employees' options, the company did issue a one-time stock option grant at $36.88 in August, when Ken Lay resumed his former role as the company's chief executive. Lay, who had held the job for 15 years, turned the position over to Jeffrey Skilling in February. Skilling quit in August, citing family reasons.       The August grant, which was equivalent to 5 percent of employees' base salary, didn't require a vesting period, but was exercisable immediately. Enron's shares haven't closed above $36.88 since Aug. 29.  --Margot Habiby in the Dallas newsroom (214) 954-9452, or  ",c..giron@enron.com,m..love@enron.com,FW: Enron Mentions,2001-10-26 11:11:52-07:00,sent

Enron Corp., scrambling to restore confidence in its finances, is negotiati= ng with banks for a new credit line of between $1 billion and $2 billion, a= nd is likely to close a deal within days, according to officials familiar w= ith the matter.=20 The new credit line is intended to bolster Enron's financial condition and = head off a potentially devastating loss of investor and business confidence= . The new credit would supplement existing lines, which are largely tapped = out after Enron last week drew down about $3 billion to increase cash reser= ves and calm fears in the stock, bond and energy markets. An Enron spokesman confirmed that the company is negotiating a new credit l= ine, but said he couldn't supply any further details.=20 Houston-based Enron is the nation's biggest energy trader and a principal i= n nearly one-quarter of all electricity and natural-gas trades. Once a favo= rite of Wall Street, the company now is in the unfamiliar position of convi= ncing a deeply concerned investment community that, despite difficulties, i= ts finances remain sound.=20 Confidence in Enron's financial situation was shaken after Enron earlier th= is month announced a $618 million third-quarter loss and disclosed a $1.2 b= illion erosion of shareholder equity related to controversial transactions = it had done with entities connected to its then-chief financial officer, An= drew Fastow.=20 Last week, Enron replaced Mr. Fastow and said that the Securities and Excha= nge Commission was looking into the transactions. The company has consisten= tly said that the transactions were proper and legal.=20 Enron's stock price fell again Friday. As of 4 p.m., in composite trading o= n the New York Stock Exchange, Enron shares were down 95 cents at $15.40. E= nron shares have fallen 50% in the past two weeks and are down 83% from a S= ept. 18, 2000, high of $89.63.=20 Late last week, Enron tapped its existing credit lines, with part of that m= oney being used to redeem nearly $2 billion of its outstanding commercial p= aper, or short-term corporate IOUs. Ron Barone of credit-rating agency Stan= dard & Poor's said he believes that Enron was ""getting a bit more resistanc= e"" recently in rolling over its commercial paper as it came due. Thus, Enro= n probably decided it would be easier simply to redeem the paper outstandin= g, he said.=20 The Enron spokesman yesterday said that paying off the commercial paper and=  still leaving the company with an additional roughly $1 billion cash on ha= nd would give it more financial flexibility.=20 Also last week, credit-rating agencies warned investors they were reviewing=  Enron's debt and commercial-paper ratings for a possible downgrade. A lowe= r rating could hamper Enron's core trading businesses.=20 Behind the worries among these agencies, in part, is the loss of investor c= onfidence, which one of the rating companies, Fitch, said in a report last = week could impair ""Enron's financial flexibility and access to capital mark= ets, therefore impacting its ability to conduct its business.""=20 The Enron spokesman said yesterday that the company's trading partners are = doing business with Enron on ""essentially the same terms"" as they have in t= he past. ""There has been no significant change in the credit conditions,"" h= e said. Trading partners demanding significantly stricter terms from Enron = would be a sign of further deteriorating confidence in the energy giant's f= inances.=20 The banks involved in the current negotiations, including J.P. Morgan Chase=  & Co. and Citigroup Inc., are asking Enron for stricter covenants on the n= ew credit line than they had asked for in the past, one official said.=20 Bankers involved with the company say the goal of the new credit line is to=  show the investment community that Enron can meet its commitments. ""Confid= ence in this company was lost,"" said one bank official involved in the nego= tiations for a new credit line. ""But confidence will be restored.""=20 Corporations of Enron's size commonly establish credit lines only to demons= trate to the investment community that in case of an emergency, they have a= ccess to cash. In practice, few companies actually make use of these lines.=  Thus, drawing down credit lines, while providing immediate cash, also illu= strates the pressure Enron is feeling.  Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. =09    Manager's Journal: How Enron Ran Out of Gas By Paul Kedrosky  10/29/2001 The Wall Street Journal A22 (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)  Is troubled Enron Corp. the Long Term Capital Management of the energy mark= ets, or merely yet another mismanaged company whose executives read too man= y of their own press releases? Or is poor Enron just misunderstood? Those a= re the questions after another week of Chinese water torture financial rele= ases from the beleaguered Houston-based energy concern.=20 A year ago Enron was the hottest of the hot. While tech stocks were tanking= , Enron's shares gained 89% during 2000. Even die-hard Enron skeptics -- of=  which there are many -- had to concede that last year was a barnburner for=  the company. Earnings were up 25%, and revenues more than doubled. Not bad, considering where the company came from. A decade ago 80% of Enron= 's revenues came from the staid (and regulated) gas-pipeline business. No l= onger. Enron has been selling those assets steadily, partly fuelling revenu= es, but also expanding into new areas. By 2000, around 95% of its revenues = and more than 80% of its profits came from trading energy, and buying and s= elling stakes in energy producers.=20 The stock market applauded the move: At its peak, Enron was trading at arou= nd 55 times earnings. That's more like Cisco's once tropospheric valuation = than the meager 2.5 times earnings the market affords Enron competitor Duke=  Energy.=20 But Enron management wanted more. It was, after all, a ""new economy"" Web-ba= sed energy trader where aggressive performers were lucratively rewarded. Ac= cording to Enron Chairman and CEO Ken Lay, the company deserved to be value= d accordingly. At a conference early this year he told investors the compan= y's stock should be trading much higher -- say $126, more than double its p= rice then.=20 Then the new economy motor stalled. The company's president left under stra= nge circumstances. And rumors swirled about Enron's machinations in Califor= nia's energy markets. Investors pored over Enron's weakening financial stat= ements. But Enron analysts must have the energy and persistence of Talmudic=  scholars to penetrate the company's cryptic financials. In effect, Enron's=  troubles were hiding in plain sight.=20 It should have been a warning. Because of the poor financial disclosure the= re was no way to assess the damage the economy was doing to the company, or=  how it was trying to make its numbers. Most analysts blithely concede that=  they really didn't know how Enron made money -- in good markets or bad.=20 Not that Enron didn't make money, it did -- albeit with a worrisomely low r= eturn on equity given the capital required -- but sometimes revenues came f= rom asset sales and complex off-balance sheet transactions, sometimes from = energy-trading revenues. And it was very difficult to understand why or how=  -- or how likely it was Enron could do it again next quarter.=20 Enron's financial inscrutability hid stranger stuff. Deep inside the compan= y filings was mention of LJM Cayman, L.P., a private investment partnership= . According to Enron's March 2000 10-K, a ""senior officer of Enron is the m= anaging member"" of LJM. Well, that was a puzzler. LJM was helping Enron ""ma= nage price and value risk with regard to certain merchant and similar asset= s by entering into derivatives, including swaps, puts, and collars."" It was= , in a phrase, Enron's house hedge fund.=20 There is nothing wrong with hedging positions in the volatile energy market=  -- it is crucial for a market-maker. But having an Enron executive managin= g and benefiting from the hedging is something else altogether, especially = when the Enron executive was the company's CFO, Andrew Fastow.

By SIMON LONDON and SHEILA MCNULTY.  10/29/2001 Financial Times (c) 2001 Financial Times Limited . All Rights Reserved  COMMENT & ANALYSIS - Enron flickers - Once a paragon of the new economy, th= e US energy group is under scrutiny for its opaque accounting and free-whee= ling management, write Simon London and Sheila McNulty.=20 Enron has some explaining to do. For the past decade or more, the Texas-bas= ed company has basked in the admiration of investors and business school pr= ofessors eager to understand its transformation from staid utility to fast-= growing energy trader. Now it faces scrutiny of a more unwelcome kind. Its share price has been falling since the beginning of this year. The US S= ecurities and Exchange Commission is investigating multi-million dollar dea= ls with a private equity fund associated with its own chief financial offic= er, which resulted in a $1.2bn reduction in shareholders' equity. A hastily= -convened conference call last week with analysts raised as many questions = as it answered about these ""related-party transactions"". The departure of A= ndy Fastow, the aforementioned CFO, soon followed.=20 With its credit rating under review by two leading ratings agencies, Enron = has also been forced to draw down bank credit lines. Yesterday if confirmed=  it was trying to establish additional lines of liquidity.=20 ""This marks the end of Enron's walk on the wild side,"" observes Curt Launer= , an analyst with Credit Suisse First Boston, the investment bank.=20 On the surface, events at Enron can be explained by the combination of dete= riorating trading conditions, a complex capital structure and poor investor=  relations. But the root causes go back further. The entrepreneurial cultur= e and dynamic management that fuelled Enron's growth in the 1990s appear to=  have also sown some of the seeds of the present crisis. Therein may lie a = cautionary tale for all executives trying to sprinkle ""new economy"" magic o= n to old economy companies.=20 Enron's transformation began in earnest in 1990 with the arrival of Jeffrey=  Skilling, who was hired from McKinsey, the management consulting firm, to = develop energy trading.=20 For the previous decade Enron had been emerging as a force in the deregulat= ing US energy markets under the guidance of Kenneth Lay, a former deputy un= der-secretary of energy. Mr Lay remains chairman. But it was Mr Skilling wh= o spearheaded the move into trading energy as well as generating and supply= ing it.=20 The two sides of the business - trading and generation/supply - have always=  been strange bedfellows. The former demands an entrepreneurial spirit more=  likely to be found on Wall Street than in a utility. Mr Skilling's answer = in the early 1990s was to bring in talent from outside the company. One of = his first recruits was Mr Fastow, an expert in securitisation, the repackag= ing of financial assets so they can be traded in financial markets.=20 The energy trading division tried from the start to differentiate itself. A=  management structure was introduced with only four layers - vice-president= , director, manager and associate/ analyst - much like a consulting firm. E= mployees were free to take as much holiday as they liked, so long as they d= elivered results. As one of Mr Skilling's early recruits recalled: ""It was = all about creating an atmosphere and deliberately breaking the rules.""=20 The seemingly free-wheeling style was based on a ""loose-tight"" management m= odel expounded by Tom Peters and Bob Waterman, the management writers and M= cKinsey alumni. At Enron this meant that employees in the merchant energy b= usiness were encouraged by huge bonuses to pursue new ideas and innovate in=  existing markets.=20 Up-and-coming employees moved freely between projects in pursuit of glory. = Louise Kitchen, the 32-year-old British executive who was the creative forc= e behind Enron Online, the group's internet-based trading platform, changed=  jobs or was promoted seven times in five years.=20 Balancing these loose management practices were tight central control of ri= sk, legal commitments, finance and performance evaluation/remuneration. Mr = Skilling once described the approach in this way: ""As long as you clear you= r deals or business ideas through those screens, you can do whatever you wa= nt around here.""=20 This approach did deliver growth and innovation. As well as making markets = in its core energy products, Enron now trades everything from weather deriv= atives - which enable companies to insure themselves against unfavourable c= limatic conditions - to broadband telecommunications capacity and metals. T= he success of Enron Online allows the group to describe itself as the world= 's leading e-commerce company.=20 It has also started marketing electricity to US consumers through a joint v= enture with International Business Machines and America Online, the interne= t service provider.=20 In February this year Mr Skilling got his reward: he became chief executive=  of a group ranked seventh in Fortune magazine's list of the 500 most power= ful US corporations - ahead of such corporate giants as IBM, AT&T, Bank of = America and Boeing.=20 In retrospect, however, this breakneck pace of growth and innovation was ac= hieved at a price. First was the personal cost to Mr Skilling. In August he=  abruptly resigned after only six months in the top job. Personal, non-heal= th related reasons were cited and investors have received no further explan= ation.=20 A second cost was an enormous increase in financial complexity. In order to=  avoid a ballooning of assets and liabilities as the group expanded, Enron = used a range of off-balance sheet vehicles to help finance expansion. LJM, = the private equity fund in which Mr Fastow played a role, is just one of a = cast of characters to be found in the footnotes to Enron's accounts. Other = financing vehicles include Osprey, Marlin, Whitewing, Atlantic Water Trust = and Azurix. ""They went after too many things too quickly,"" says Stephen Moo= re of Moody's Investors Service, the credit ratings agency.=20 A third cost, associated with the last, was a loss of financial transparenc= y. The group's extensive use of swaps, options and other derivative financi= al instruments in its merchant energy business means that investors have li= ttle idea of how Enron actually makes its money - or the underlying risks t= o which it is exposed.=20 David Fleischer, an analyst at Goldman Sachs, summed up the views of many i= nvestors during last week's conference call. He told the group's management= : ""The company's credibility is being severely questioned and there is a ne= ed for much more disclosure. There is an appearance that you are hiding som= ething or that there is something going on beneath the surface that may be = questionable.""=20 The fourth cost was a loss of strategic focus. ""The problems, in our view, = stem from Enron venturing too aggressively in areas outside of its core ski= lls,"" argues Raymond Niles, analyst at Salomon Smith Barney. ""Power plants = in India, water companies, extension of their franchise to the mass retail = market, and using a fibre-optic network to deliver content over the interne= t are all unrelated, or only tangentially related, to their core merchant e= nergy business.""=20 Enron executives also appeared to get carried away with the prospects for s= ome of these ventures. This time last year Mr Skilling was arguing that Enr= on Broadband was a business worth $35bn ( #24bn) in its own right. This hel= ped push the share price to all-time highs - and storing up trouble when tr= ading volumes failed to materialise.=20 ""They over-promised on the new business they created,"" says Chris Bartlett,=  a professor at Harvard Business School and long-time watcher of the compan= y. ""Enron was trying to ride the dotcom bubble with Enron Online and the br= oadband business. To some extent they are now paying the price.""=20 Will Enron weather the storm? Notwithstanding the risk of further out-of-th= e-blue financial shocks, most analysts believe that it will. The merchant e= nergy business remains powerful and profitable. Mr Niles at Salomon Smith B= arney points out that this side of the group drives more than 80 per cent o= f earnings and has shown consistent 30-40 per cent annual growth over the p= ast three years. Assets totalling more than $4bn were also earmarked for di= sposal before the current crisis erupted, underlining that there is plenty = of realisable value within the group's portfolio of physical energy assets.= =20 And yet the doubts remain. It is, ultimately, a question of confidence and = credibility. Investors suspect that the balance between loose and tight man= agement methods has tilted too far towards the former.

The new credit line is additional to the $3.3 billion credit line it tapped last week, the paper said, and should be completed within days.

The stock has fallen by 54 percent since the announcement.       The company's shares were further dented after an investor sued Enron last month, saying dealings with two partnerships run by former Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow, cost the company $35 million.

Skilling, its chief executive, Enron= 's arrogance had grown even more quickly.=20 The company, based in Houston, dripped contempt for the regulators and cons= umer groups that stood between it and fully deregulated markets -- for elec= tricity, water and everything else. Everyone would win under deregulation, = Enron said -- especially its shareholders, whose stock would soar as the co= mpany profited from creating new markets.=20 ''We are on the side of angels,'' Mr. Skilling said in March, dismissing th= ose who saw the company as a profiteer in California's energy crisis. ''Peo= ple want to have open, competitive markets. They want fair competition. It'= s the American way.''=20 But less than a year later, everybody seems to have lost, especially Enron'= s investors. Enron's stock is plunging, and questions about its finances ar= e mounting.=20 Some experts in the energy industry worry that if the crisis at the company=  worsens, trading in natural gas and electricity could be seriously disrupt= ed and energy prices could grow more volatile. In a worst-case outlook, Enr= on could become the 2001 version of Long-Term Capital Management, the huge = hedge fund whose collapse roiled financial markets during the fall of 1998.=  Enron's shares have fallen more than 80 percent this year, erasing $50 bil= lion in shareholder value.=20 Enron closed on Friday at $15.40, down 95 cents, after hitting a 52-week lo= w of $15.04 earlier in the day.=20 The future of electricity deregulation is in doubt, thanks to blackouts and=  soaring power prices in California earlier this year -- a crisis that ende= d only when that state contradicted deregulation's basic tenets by interven= ing deeply in the power market. Enron's efforts to become a profit-making w= ater supplier and to create a new market in broadband communications capaci= ty have been expensive failures. In August, Mr. Skilling quit, forcing Kenn= eth L. Lay, his predecessor as chief executive and still Enron's chairman, = to resume day-to-day control of the company.=20 The company declined to make senior executives, including Mr. Lay, availabl= e for comment, and asked that questions be submitted in writing. Mr. Skilli= ng could not be reached.=20 Enron's problems boiled over earlier this month, when it disclosed that its=  shareholders' equity, a measure of the company's value, dropped by $1.2 bi= llion in the last quarter because of a deal disclosed only very hazily in E= nron's regular financial statements. The Securities and Exchange Commission=  is looking into the company's financial reporting, and some investors ques= tion whether Enron has overstated profits at its primary business of tradin= g electricity and natural gas.=20 THE slump in the company's shares accelerated after Enron revealed the fall=  in its shareholders' equity. On Wednesday, the company forced out its chie= f financial officer, Andrew S. Fastow, who is at the center of the controve= rsy over Enron's confusing finances. The company, which six months ago seem= ed to be reaping billions of dollars from California's energy crisis, today=  faces a potential cash crunch.=20 The surprise about shareholder equity inflamed investors' smoldering concer= n about Enron's opaque financial statements. Now, with Wall Street analysts=  and bond-rating agencies demanding more information about the complex tran= sactions that have fueled the company's profits, Enron has been reduced to = issuing news releases assuring investors that it has adequate access to cas= h.=20 Enron does not appear to be in immediate danger of running out of cash. On = Thursday, the company drew down a $3.3 billion credit line it had previousl= y arranged with a group of banks led by Citigroup and J. P. Morgan Chase, w= hich have each extended at least $400 million. But because of Enron's impor= tance in the natural gas and electricity markets, industry experts say that=  any problem at the company could disrupt energy trading nationwide.=20 The supply of natural gas and electricity would probably not be affected ev= en if the company failed, because Enron is mainly a trader, rather than a p= roducer, of energy. But a crisis at the company might increase the volatili= ty of energy prices, which have swung wildly in the last year.=20 Philip K. Verleger Jr., an energy-markets economist, emphasized that he tho= ught Enron would survive this crisis. But he said it was not clear what wou= ld happen if Enron ran out of cash or if traders that use the company's Enr= onOnline Internet trading marketplace defaulted on their obligations.=20 ''You suddenly have all these positions they have taken on there -- are the= y good? Are the firm's hedges good? What's the situation?'' Mr. Verleger sa= id. ''It's got everyone scared.''=20 In the short run, Enron's credit rating may be its biggest problem. If the = company's rating falls below investment grade, Enron could be forced to iss= ue tens of millions of shares of stock to cover loans that it has guarantee= d. But creating new shares would make the shares that already exist less va= luable, because those shares would no longer represent full ownership of th= e company.=20 A drop in the company's credit rating could also prompt other energy trader= s and producers to back away from doing business with Enron, hurting the co= mpany's sales and profits.=20 Enron's credit rating stands several notches above the critical point. But = its bonds, which are publicly traded, have fallen so low that they are now = offering interest rates of almost 10 percent, comparable with many junk bon= ds. Two of the three major credit-rating agencies, Moody's Investors Servic= e and Fitch Investors Service, have put Enron's bonds on review for possibl= e downgrades.=20 ''The issue that's in the front of everybody's mind right now is credit,'' = said Mark Gurley, senior vice president and general manager for trading at = Aquila Inc., one of the nation's largest energy traders. Aquila is based in=  Kansas City, Mo.=20 For now, Aquila and other major energy traders and producers, including Rel= iant Energy, the El Paso Corporation and Dynegy, are continuing to do busin= ess with Enron. And Mr. Gurley said that Enron's own trading in the electri= city and natural gas markets did not suggest the sort of frenzied selling r= eminiscent of the collapse of Long-Term Capital Management in 1998.=20 ''They haven't done anything trading-wise that gives me any indication they=  are closing their books down,'' he said.=20 Still, some executives at other companies said they were looking more caref= ully at transactions with Enron, especially long-term contracts. They also = said risk-management and credit officers were calling each other regularly = to discuss the situation.=20 Mark Palmer, an Enron spokesman, said on Friday that no energy-trading comp= any had stopped doing business with Enron. He declined to say whether any o= f the company's trading partners had suspended or altered credit terms. He = said the company was continuing to see normal volumes of business.=20 But the crisis that Enron will face if its credit rating is downgraded is j= ust a symptom of the bigger problem the company must confront. For years, t= he details of Enron's finances have been a mystery even to the Wall Street = analysts whose job it is to follow the company, and to the investors who ow= n its stock and bonds. When Enron's profits were soaring and it was creatin= g lucrative new markets, shareholders did not seem to care about the impene= trability of its financial statements.=20 Now they do. Yet the company seems incapable of offering straight answers t= o the questions investors ask.=20 To others in the industry, the opaqueness of the company's financial statem= ents parallels Enron's efforts to keep its energy-trading business lightly = regulated and free of disclosure requirements. Though they do not expect En= ron to crumble like Long-Term Capital Management, they say that, like the g= iant hedge fund, Enron uses a lot of debt, regulatory oversight is limited = and outsiders have a difficult time figuring out its finances.=20 The most pressing concerns are a series of partnerships and trusts Enron cr= eated to move some of its assets and debt off its balance sheet. With names=  like Marlin and Osprey, the partnerships have at least $3.3 billion in bon= ds outstanding, backed by assets like a stake in Azurix, Enron's water comp= any subsidiary. Enron has promised that if the partnerships' debts exceed t= he value of their assets, Enron will issue enough new shares to make up the=  difference.=20 DEALS with partnerships formed by Mr. Fastow, who was chief financial offic= er when they were organized, led to the $1.2 billion write-off in sharehold= ers' equity that Enron announced last week. The company has offered only sk= impy details of its transactions with those partnerships.=20 Enron ended its relationships with those partnerships in the last quarter, = after being criticized by shareholders. In the process, it wrote off a prom= issory note that it had carried on its books, reducing its shareholders' eq= uity by $1.2 billion. But, because of complex accounting rules, the transac= tion was not apparent in Enron's quarterly earnings report.=20 The transaction disturbs investors because it suggests that Enron may have = found a way to hide losses, throwing the accuracy of its financial statemen= ts into question. When Enron released third-quarter earnings on Oct. 16, it=  reported a loss from $1 billion in write-offs on failed investments. The e= arnings statement did not mention the additional $1.2 billion equity write-= down. But the company said its core business had been solidly profitable, a= nd its shares rose.=20 In a conference call with analysts after the announcement, Mr. Lay, Enron's=  chairman, also disclosed the reduction in shareholder equity. The referenc= e was a brief one, however, and some listeners did not catch it. Those anal= ysts were angered when they found out the next day what Enron had done, and=  many were confused by the accounting procedure. Enron's stock began to sli= de, and investors clamored for more information about the write-off. But so=  far, the company's efforts to clear up the situation have further unnerved=  investors.=20 Mr. Lay has met with investors during the last two weeks to try to explain = the deals, but some on Wall Street say they have come away with doubts abou= t Mr. Lay's grasp of the situation. They say that the two people at Enron w= ho appear to have been most knowledgeable about the deals -- Mr. Skilling a= nd Mr. Fastow -- have both left the company.=20 In an interview in late August, Mr. Lay said he did not know some details a= bout the deals involving Mr. Fastow. In response to one question about them= , he said, ''You're getting way over my head.''=20 Mr. Palmer of Enron disputed any suggestion that Mr. Lay did not have a gra= sp of the investments at issue, saying Mr. Lay was handicapped in talking a= bout them because of the S.E.C. investigation. ''There is not a whole lot w= e can say, or should say, about them,'' Mr. Palmer said. He also said the c= ompany expected to generate about $3 billion in cash through asset sales by=  the end of next year.=20 In a conference call on Tuesday, analysts pressed Mr. Lay and other top Enr= on executives to reveal more information about the LJM write-down and its o= ther partnerships. Instead, they offered only vague explanations of the dea= l, leaving Wall Street worried that more write-offs might be coming.=20 David Fleischer, a Goldman, Sachs analyst and a longtime supporter of the c= ompany, was among those who came away concerned. ''If Enron is unable to cl= arify its off-balance-sheet transactions and restore confidence in the very=  near term by assuring investors that no more surprises are forthcoming tha= t would affect the balance sheet or liquidity position, then the company wi= ll likely lose access to the capital markets,'' he wrote in a research note=  after the call.=20 To try to reassure investors, Enron said late Thursday that EnronOnline, it= s Internet-based trading exchange, executed more than 8,400 trades that day= , a higher-than-normal volume.=20 ''We know we have our work cut out for us if we are to rebuild our credibil= ity with the investment community -- and we're working on that,'' Mr. Lay s= aid in a statement. ''But in the meantime, the best evidence of our strengt= h is the willingness of customers to bring their business to Enron.''=20 But those reassurances apparently are no longer enough for Wall Street. Enr= on's stock tumbled almost 6 percent Friday, to its lowest levels in six yea= rs.=20 Now analysts are scrambling to figure out the extent of Enron's off-balance= -sheet debt and to assess the risk that the company will have to issue new = shares to make good on its partnership guarantees.=20 Carol Coale, an analyst at Prudential Securities in Houston, calculates tha= t Enron may have close to $9 billion in off-balance-sheet debt. She said th= at Enron had for two years been trying to sell about $6 billion in foreign = assets -- including properties in Latin America and a power plant in India = embroiled in a dispute with the state government -- and she worries about t= hose prospects for sale in light of Enron's problems and the souring econom= y.=20 ''As Enron is forced to sell assets to keep the ratings agencies off their = backs, they may have to write those assets down,'' Ms. Coale said. On Wedne= sday, she downgraded her rating on Enron to ''sell'' from ''neutral.''=20 ''The bottom line is, it's really difficult to recommend an investment when=  management does not disclose the facts,'' Ms. Coale said.=20 Short-sellers, who attacked Enron's accounting even before the company disc= losed the write-off, say the company's problems may run even deeper than an= alysts fear. Enron may have used the partnerships not just to finance money= -losing investments but to hide losses in its core trading business, they s= ay.=20 ''The company still isn't disclosing enough to know whether the core busine= ss, the trading business, is profitable,'' said Mark Roberts, director of r= esearch at Off Wall Street, which recommended shorting Enron's stock on May=  7, when it stood at $59.43. ''The issue remains: why are they doing these = transactions? Our theory has been that the core operations aren't that prof= itable.''=20 James Chanos, a leading short-seller who has bet that Enron's stock will fa= ll, said, ''Is Enron booking gains when it has real profits, but hiding the=  losses when deals go against it?'' Mr. Palmer of Enron said the company st= ood by its reported energy-trading profits.=20 Even traders at other energy companies say they do not have a clear picture=  of Enron's positions. Enron maintains that it is in no danger of being wip= ed out by a sharp move in electricity or gas prices because it keeps its tr= ading book balanced -- meaning the energy it has agreed to sell is offset, = in roughly equivalent amounts, by energy it has agreed to buy.=20 ''With these guys, they tell us -- and all you've got is their word -- that=  they're hedged,'' said Mr. Verleger, the economist.=20 IN fact, Enron has lobbied forcefully over the years to limit regulation an= d disclosure of its trading operations. Last year, the company successfully=  lobbied Congress to effectively ensure that its Internet-trading platform = would be exempted from regulation by the Commodity Futures Trading Commissi= on.=20 Enron and other power traders do file limited information in reports to the=  Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the agency that oversees wholesale e= lectricity and natural gas markets. But the commission does not keep track = of specific transactions and prices.=20 Large-scale energy trading has existed for only about a half-dozen years. E= nron pioneered the business, and now dominates it, accounting for about one= -quarter of all trading in the United States.=20 Before Congress and federal regulators opened up the market for wholesale e= lectricity, a process that began in earnest a decade ago, the power busines= s was a simpler affair. Utilities were given areas of monopoly service, and=  their rates -- and ability to deliver enough electricity -- were overseen = by state regulators. But with the move to deregulate the business, independ= ent and unregulated generators and traders have flourished, providing an ev= er-growing portion of the nation's power.=20 Beginning in the 1980's, the sale and transportation of natural gas was als= o deregulated, spurring Enron, which used to be primarily a gas-pipeline co= mpany, to move into the trading business.=20 The company's shift to trading gas and electricity accelerated in the mid-1= 990's, with the ascension of Mr. Skilling, who became chief executive in Fe= bruary, just six months before his unexpected resignation. Underscoring the=  change in direction, in securities filings this year Enron described its p= rincipal business as ''security brokers, dealers and flotation.'' Before, i= t had said it was in the business of ''wholesale-petroleum and petroleum pr= oducts.''=20 For most of its ascent, Enron reported outstanding profit figures and Wall = Street accepted them with pleasure. A year ago, when it disclosed the first=  transactions with partnerships led by Mr. Fastow, the company's former chi= ef financial officer, analysts who asked questions were told that the deals=  were routine and were being disclosed only because of Mr. Fastow's involve= ment.=20 Enron does not appear to face an immediate cash crunch. But the bank credit=  lines that it drew on last week to pay off its short-term debt will have t= o be renegotiated next spring. The controversial partnerships do not have t= o pay their debts until the following year -- unless Enron loses its invest= ment-grade credit rating before that.=20 ENRON will also need to maintain its large trading positions, which could s= uffer if participants in those markets grow more nervous about Enron's cred= it. When Long-Term Capital was stumbling in 1998, some Wall Street rivals s= old the securities they thought Long-Term owned, trying to force Long-Term = to sell its positions quickly and at a loss. Something similar in energy ma= rkets might be possible. If so, Enron might find, as Long-Term did, that po= sitions that should offset each other do not.=20 Enron's new chief financial officer may yet persuade investors that in fact=  the company's profits are real, and that its condition is better than the = short-sellers believe. As questions are answered, confidence, and the share=  price, could rebound.=20 But for now, investors are skittish, and some competitors are eager to take=  advantage of Enron's plight.

Fastow, beginning in the summer of 1999. B= ecause they were transactions among related parties, the company was requir= ed to disclose them, but the disclosures raised as many questions as they a= nswered. Following are some questions that investors are asking, and the cu= rrently available answers.=20 Q. Why did Enron enter into the deals? A. Enron's first disclosures, in 1999, gave no reason. In later reports, it=  said it was seeking to ''hedge certain merchant investments and other asse= ts,'' by which it apparently meant investments in technology and telecommun= ications companies.=20 Q. How did those investments do?=20 A. It looks as if they plunged in value, although there is no clear disclos= ure on that.=20 Q. Why can't that be discerned?=20 A. The company never said just what the investments were. And the transacti= ons with the partnerships were complicated, involving a variety of derivati= ve securities, Enron stock and various promissory notes. Enron's financial = disclosures do not provide enough information to understand the arrangement= s completely.=20 Q. Why were they so complicated?=20 A. One reason may have been to use accounting rules to its advantage. One a= ccounting rule dictates that companies may not record profits or losses on = transactions in their own stock. If a company sells its shares at $10 each = and then buys them back -- whether for $1 or $50 -- there is no gain or los= s. But shareholder equity does go up or down on the balance sheet -- in tha= t case reflecting how much extra cash the company took in, or paid out, on = the transactions. Enron's transactions appear to have been structured to fa= ll under that rule.=20 Q. Who made money from these transactions?=20 A. Enron reported some profits along the way from the deals, although not a= ll of the profits were spelled out in its quarterly filings. And it appears=  that the partnerships distributed money to investors.=20 Q. If the deals began in 1999, why all the uproar now?=20 A. Many investors and analysts were not curious about them when everything = seemed to be going well. As long as Enron was exceeding its forecasted prof= its each quarter, they were willing to assume that what was not being discl= osed was not really important.=20 Q. When were concerns raised with Enron?=20 A. The complaints grew as Enron's share price fell earlier this year. By th= is summer, Enron decided that Mr. Fastow would sell his stake in the partne= rships. Then, because the partnerships would no longer be considered relate= d to Enron, the company would no longer have to disclose anything about the=  transactions. But investors were still worried, and Enron later closed out=  its deals with the partnerships.=20 Q. How did Enron do?=20 A. Badly. It took a $35 million loss, which, given the size of the transact= ions involved and the previous profits taken, was not very much. But it als= o reduced shareholder equity by $1.2 billion.=20 Q. How did that happen?=20 A. That, like so much else, is not clear. But it looks as if the partnershi= p owed Enron that much money, could not pay and was let off the hook by Enr= on. In return, Enron terminated ''previously recorded contractual obligatio= ns to deliver Enron shares in future periods.'' Enron treated that like a s= hare buyback, even though the shares in question had not been issued, and d= etermined that there was no need to treat it as a loss that would reduce re= ported earnings.=20 Q. Is that legal under the accounting rules?=20 A. Presumably it is. But Enron's limited disclosures make it impossible to = say for sure. Enron may have discovered ways to use the accounting rules to=  enable it to keep losses off income statements, while leaving profits on t= hem. That may become clearer when the Securities and Exchange Commission, w= hich has begun preliminary inquiries, completes its work. FLOYD NORRIS  Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

But let's not be so hasty. Not every= thing changes that fast -- least of all Washington. The White House's home-= front failures are not sudden, unpredictable products of wartime confusion = but direct products of an ethos that has been in place since Jan. 20.=20 This is an administration that will let its special interests -- particular= ly its high-rolling campaign contributors and its noisiest theocrats of the=  right -- have veto power over public safety, public health and economic pr= udence in war, it turns out, no less than in peacetime. When anthrax struck= , the administration's first impulse was not to secure as much Cipro as spe= edily as possible to protect Americans, but to protect the right of pharmac= eutical companies to profiteer. The White House's faith in tax cuts as a pa= nacea for all national ills has led to such absurdities as this week's Hous= e ''stimulus'' package showering $254 million on Enron, the reeling Houston=  energy company (now under S.E.C. investigation) that has served as a Bush = campaign cash machine.=20 Airport security, which has been enhanced by at best cosmetic tweaks since = Sept. 11, is also held hostage by campaign cash: As Salon has reported, Ser= viceMaster, a supplier of the low-wage employees who ineptly man the gates,=  is another G.O.P. donor. Not that Republicans stand alone in putting fat c= ats first. In a display of bipartisanship, Democrats -- lobbied by Linda Ha= ll Daschle, the Senate majority leader's wife -- joined the administration = in handing the airlines a $15 billion bailout that enforces no reduction in=  the salaries of the industry's C.E.O.'s even as they lay off tens of thous= ands of their employees.=20 To see how the religious right has exerted its own distortions on homeland = security, you also have to consider an administration pattern that goes bac= k to its creation -- and one that explains the recent trials of poor Tom Ri= dge.=20 Mr. Ridge is by all accounts a capable leader -- a successful governor of a=  large state (Pennsylvania) who won the Bronze Star for heroism in Vietnam.=  A close friend of George W. Bush, he should have been in the administratio= n from the get-go, and was widely rumored to be a candidate for various job= s, including the vice presidency. But after being pilloried by the right be= cause he supports abortion rights, he got zilch. Instead of Mr. Ridge, the = administration signed on the pro-life John Ashcroft and Tommy Thompson -- w= ho have brought us where we are today.=20 The farcical failures of these two cabinet secretaries are not merely those=  of public relations -- though Mr. Thompson often comes across as a Chamber=  of Commerce glad-hander who doesn't know his pants are on fire, and Mr. As= hcroft often shakes as if he's not just seen great Caesar's ghost but perha= ps John Mitchell's as well. Both have a history of letting politics overrid= e public policy that dates to the start of the administration. They've seen=  no reason to reverse their partisan priorities even at a time when the pat= riotic duty of effectively fighting terror should be their No. 1 concern.= =20 Pre-Sept. 11, Mr. Thompson, in defiance of science, heartily lent his credi= bility to the Bush administration's stem cell ''compromise'' by going along=  with its overstatement of the viability and diversity of the stem cell lin= es it would deliver to researchers. Post-Sept. 11, he destroyed his credibi= lity by understating the severity of the anthrax threat, also in defiance o= f science. Now he maintains that the $1.5 billion the administration is req= uesting to plug the many holes in our public health system -- almost all of=  it earmarked for stockpiling pharmaceuticals, not shoring up local hospita= ls -- is adequate for fighting bioterrorism. This, too, is in defiance of a= ll expert estimates, including that of the one physician in the Senate, the=  Republican Bill Frist.=20 It should also be on Mr. Thompson's conscience that for the first two weeks=  of the anthrax crisis he kept the federal government's house physician -- = David Satcher, the surgeon general and a much-needed honest broker of publi= c health -- locked away, presumably because Dr. Satcher, a Clinton appointe= e, became persona non grata in the Bush administration for issuing a June r= eport on teenage sexuality that angered the religious right. Only after Mr.=  Ridge arrived on the scene was the surgeon general liberated from the gula= g.=20 As for Mr. Ashcroft, he has gone so far as to turn away firsthand informati= on about domestic terrorism for political reasons. Planned Parenthood, whic= h has been on the front lines of anthrax scares for years and has by grim n= ecessity marshaled the medical and security expertise to combat them, has s= ought a meeting with the attorney general since he took office but has neve= r been granted one. This was true not only before Sept. 11 but, says Ann Gl= azier, Planned Parenthood's director of security, remains true -- even thou= gh her organization, long targeted by such home-grown Talibans as the Army = of God, has a decade's worth of leads on ''the convergence of international=  and domestic terrorism.''=20 Ms. Glazier found the sight of Mr. Ashcroft and other federal Keystone Kops=  offering a $1 million reward for anthrax terrorists a laughable indication=  of how little grasp they have of the enemy. ''Religious extremists don't r= espond to money,'' she points out. Such is the state of the F.B.I., she add= s, that one agent told a clinic to hold onto a suspect letter for a couple = of days ''because we have so many here we're afraid we're going to lose it'= ' (perhaps among the Timothy McVeigh documents).=20 If either the attorney general or the secretary of health and human service= s inspired anything like the confidence that, say, Mayor Giuliani does, the= re wouldn't have been a need to draft Mr. Ridge. Even so, he's mainly a P.R= . gimmick -- a man who should have been in the administration in the first = place reduced to serving as a fig leaf for lightweights. As director of hom= eland security, he's allegedly charged with supervising nearly 50 governmen= t agencies -- so far with roughly a dozen staff members. When asked to defi= ne Mr. Ridge's responsibilities, Ari Fleischer said on Wednesday that it wa= s ''a very busy coordination job,'' but so far Mr. Ridge is mainly sowing s= till more confusion.=20 The one specific duty that he has claimed -- in an interview with Tom Broka= w -- was that he'd be the one ''making the phone call'' to the president to=  shoot down any commercial airliner turned into a flying bomb by hijackers.=  That presumably comes as news to Donald Rumsfeld, who made no provision fo= r any homeland security czar in the Air Force chain of command he publicly = codified days after Mr. Ridge's appointment.=20 Since the administration tightly metes out the news from Afghanistan, we ca= n only hope that the war there is being executed more effectively than the = war here -- even as Mr. Rumsfeld and his generals now tell us that the Tali= ban, once expected to implode in days, are proving Viet-Cong-like in their = intractability. The Wall Street Journal also reported this week that ''inst= ead of a thankful Afghan population, popular support for the Taliban appear= s to be solidifying and anger with the U.S. growing.''=20 Maybe we're losing that battle for Afghan hearts and minds in part because = the Bush State Department appointee in charge of the propaganda effort is a=  C.E.O. (from Madison Avenue) chosen not for her expertise in policy or pol= itics but for her salesmanship on behalf of domestic products like Head & S= houlders shampoo. If we can't effectively fight anthrax, I guess it's reass= uring to know we can always win the war on dandruff.  Drawing=20 Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

BOMBAY, Oct 27 (Reuters) - Lenders to power plant in India majority owned b= y Enron Corp have called a meeting next week in London to discuss ways of r= eviving the beleaguered project, a banking source said on Saturday.=20 They will examine offers that two Indian companies have put forward for buy= ing the U.S. energy giant's 65 percent stake, and those of two other U.S. f= irms, in Dabhol Power Company (DPC), which is building the controversial pr= oject, the source told Reuters.

I suggested to Glenda in January after Daddy died that she lease the house with the option to purchase due to the economy in Haleyville.  She obviouly has not done that.  2. The day after Daddy died, we went to the bank to get his will to take to Jeff's office for him to read to us.  Glenda tried to cash in Daddy's CD at that point and told them that she was the executrix of his estate.  They refused because she did not have a death certificate and had not been formally appointed.  3. Glenda told me that she had told Dr. Cashin that she wanted him to pay off the note on the purchase of Daddy's practice immediately.  I'm surprised that he has not since the interest rate on the note is 9%.  With regard to Jeff Mobley wanted to work something out without going to court, I am fine with that.  However my terms are:  1. The money in Daddy's checking account, saving account and CD are put back in to the estate.  2. The estate 1099's Glenda for the forgiveness of the note.  3. The value of Daddy's truck that she gave away comes out of her distribution.  4. The repayment of the $5,000 that Glenda borrowed from me in April 1996 is repaid to me at 8% annual interest from Glenda's distribution of the estate.  5. If the estate is not settled by the first anniversary of Daddy's death, that an independent third party is appointed administrator.  6. Any excessive administrative fees paid to Glenda for her work as executrix of the estate are repaid to the estate.  7. Glenda agrees in writing to discontinue her harressment of me and my family.  I am willing to give on the forgiveness of the note to Daddy.  I am willing to allow her to continue as executrix until the anniversary of Daddy's death.  Twelve months is ample time to settle an estate as simple as his.  I will allow her to keep my grandfather's single shot shotgun that Daddy left to me, but that she and her husband stole from my father's bedroom while he was in the hosptal dying.  I would even be willing to not make her repay the value of Daddy's truck or return the extra $1,000 that she sold his car for, but that she did not put in the estate.  I mailed the $1,000 check today.  Sorry for the delay.  I've just been very busy.  If we are going to file to remove Glenda as executrix, I'll need a new one with the correct date of Daddy's death to execute.  I'll be in Auburn from tomorrow night until Sunday.

I suggested to Glenda in January after Daddy died that she lease    the    house with the option to purchase due to the economy in Haleyville.  She    obviouly has not done that.     2.      The day after Daddy died, we went to the bank to get his will to    take to Jeff's office for him to read to us.  Glenda tried to cash in    Daddy's CD at that point and told them that she was the executrix of his    estate.  They refused because she did not have a death certificate and    had    not been formally appointed.     3.      Glenda told me that she had told Dr. Cashin that she wanted him    to    pay off the note on the purchase of Daddy's practice immediately.  I'm    surprised that he has not since the interest rate on the note is 9%.     With regard to Jeff Mobley wanted to work something out without going to    court, I am fine with that.  However my terms are:     1.      The money in Daddy's checking account, saving account and CD are    put    back in to the estate.     2.      The estate 1099's Glenda for the forgiveness of the note.     3.      The value of Daddy's truck that she gave away comes out of her    distribution.     4.      The repayment of the $5,000 that Glenda borrowed from me in    April    1996 is repaid to me at 8% annual interest from Glenda's distribution of    the    estate.     5.      If the estate is not settled by the first anniversary of Daddy's    death, that an independent third party is appointed administrator.     6.      Any excessive administrative fees paid to Glenda for her work as    executrix of the estate are repaid to the estate.     7.      Glenda agrees in writing to discontinue her harressment of me    and my    family.     I am willing to give on the forgiveness of the note to Daddy.  I am    willing    to allow her to continue as executrix until the anniversary of Daddy's    death.  Twelve months is ample time to settle an estate as simple as    his.  I    will allow her to keep my grandfather's single shot shotgun that Daddy    left    to me, but that she and her husband stole from my father's bedroom while    he    was in the hosptal dying.  I would even be willing to not make her repay    the    value of Daddy's truck or return the extra $1,000 that she sold his car    for,    but that she did not put in the estate.     I mailed the $1,000 check today.  Sorry for the delay.  I've just been    very    busy.  If we are going to file to remove Glenda as executrix, I'll need    a    new one with the correct date of Daddy's death to execute.     I'll be in Auburn from tomorrow night until Sunday.

We believe there has been a misinterpretation as to what has been stated.  In fact, these contracts have been setup since 1995.   Attached please find the contracts for Nicor Gas Company and Northern Illinois Gas Company.    << File: Nicor Gas Company Contracts.xls >>  << File: Northern Illinois Gas Company.xls >>    These contracts have existed in the Global Contracts system.  Per the letter dated January 23, 1998, Northern Illinois Gas Company changed its name to Nicor Gas Company.  It indicated that any existing contracts did not have to change its name to Nicor Gas Company.  Thus, the contracts remained under the name Northern Illinois Gas Company.  Further, these existing contracts were Parking, Storage, Transportation and Pooling Service Agreement.   We suggest that you setup deal tickets and if necessary, we setup new contracts with the service of Balancing ,Wheeling and Loan.  These contracts will feed to Unify accordingly.  Some of the contracts already have deals, which is indicated on the contract title or you can run the Sitara Report to locate the deals behind the contracts.

Subject: Nicor Hub contracts  We, Vol Mgmt and Settlements are still trying to get the Nicor/Northerin Illinois Gas deals cleared through Unify.  Kam had tried to help Kathy Kelly and I last year with putting in storage tickets for the deals that address the Balancing/Wheeling/ and Loan volumes that ENA is charged by the Hub every month.  These volumes are coming through the Supply verifications and Sales invoices but are not being paid, nor being sent out and therefore creating issues for Settlements.   I remember that Sylvia Campos had stated that those tickets were not possible to put in because Nicor is an Hub not a storage facility.  My Nicor rep. faxed me copies of their tariff effective July15, 1999 stating they have the capacity for storage and transportation, so I'm a little confused what the problem is that is preventing us setting Nicor up correctly in global and Unify to handle these types of storage deals individually.  Any assistance with this would be greatly appreciated as we are showing a $4 million receivable outstanding for settlements and a $1.1 million payable on the service side and need to get these cleared as soon as possible.  I can make a copy of the tariff that I have just let me know.  Thanks, Marlo James",c..james@enron.com,m..love@enron.com,RE: Nicor Hub contracts,2001-11-05 11:39:39-08:00,sent

"Please pass on the sentiments of at least 3 Auburn Alumni.  The students that appear in the pictures from Halloween dressed in racial costumes should be immediately expelled from the University and their respective fraternities should be permanently removed from campus.  We also think that PartyPics.com should be disciplined and removed from the vendor list for the University.  Auburn University and it's related organizations should not contribute money to organizations that are willing to take pictures of such insulting behavior and try and profit from them by selling them to disgusting human beings that would participate in such offensive behavior.  As graduates of Auburn University and Athletic and Academic Scholarship donors, we are appalled by these students behavior and demand immediate action be taken against them.  The longer this issue is not dealt with, the worse our University looks in the eyes of the world.  Please take action and help save Auburn's reputation.  Thanks for your assistance.

We believe there has been a misinterpretation as to what has been stated.  In fact, these contracts have been setup since 1995.   Attached please find the contracts for Nicor Gas Company and Northern Illinois Gas Company.    << File: Nicor Gas Company Contracts.xls >>  << File: Northern Illinois Gas Company.xls >>    These contracts have existed in the Global Contracts system.  Per the letter dated January 23, 1998, Northern Illinois Gas Company changed its name to Nicor Gas Company.  It indicated that any existing contracts did not have to change its name to Nicor Gas Company.  Thus, the contracts remained under the name Northern Illinois Gas Company.  Further, these existing contracts were Parking, Storage, Transportation and Pooling Service Agreement.   We suggest that you setup deal tickets and if necessary, we setup new contracts with the service of Balancing ,Wheeling and Loan.  These contracts will feed to Unify accordingly.  Some of the contracts already have deals, which is indicated on the contract title or you can run the Sitara Report to locate the deals behind the contracts.     If you need our assistance, please do not hesitate to contact us.   Thank You.  Marlene D. Hilliard   -----Original Message----- From:  James, Marlo C.

Subject: Nicor Hub contracts  We, Vol Mgmt and Settlements are still trying to get the Nicor/Northerin Illinois Gas deals cleared through Unify.  Kam had tried to help Kathy Kelly and I last year with putting in storage tickets for the deals that address the Balancing/Wheeling/ and Loan volumes that ENA is charged by the Hub every month.  These volumes are coming through the Supply verifications and Sales invoices but are not being paid, nor being sent out and therefore creating issues for Settlements.   I remember that Sylvia Campos had stated that those tickets were not possible to put in because Nicor is an Hub not a storage facility.  My Nicor rep. faxed me copies of their tariff effective July15, 1999 stating they have the capacity for storage and transportation, so I'm a little confused what the problem is that is preventing us setting Nicor up correctly in global and Unify to handle these types of storage deals individually.  Any assistance with this would be greatly appreciated as we are showing a $4 million receivable outstanding for settlements and a $1.1 million payable on the service side and need to get these cleared as soon as possible.  I can make a copy of the tariff that I have just let me know.  Thanks, Marlo James",c..james@enron.com,m..love@enron.com,RE: Nicor Hub contracts,2001-11-07 06:59:41-08:00,sent

"Phillip,  I apologize that it has taken me so long to send you an e-mail like you asked us to, but I just wanted to send some suggestions/thoughts about things on the East Desk.  1.  I really like the idea of weekly meetings.  Especially in the new building where we will be spaced out and not all sitting together, I think it would be good for team unity.  Even if the meeting is only 10 minutes long, it gives the group a chance to talk about what everyone is working on and projects that we can work with others on.  Also, with people joining East and leaving East, the meetings could give us a chance to get to know each other better.  I realize that meetings are not necessary every week, but 2 or 3 a month have very helpful and beneficial for me.  2.  We were all going to give a small ""lesson"" on an area of our jobs that we have a strong knowledge about and present it to the others in our group.  Jeff has already given a lesson on NX3 Basis positions.  Although the lessons may be a little nerve wracking, I think they would be very useful to continue.  For example, the subjects of Liquidation, Storage, and OA are all areas I would like to know more about.  That's it really.  Thank you for all of your help so far with the Gulf4/5 ""merger"".  I am really excited about our new group and I can't wait to move to the new building.  Thanks, Melissa ",m..love@enron.com,melissa.videtto@enron.com,Thoughts/Ideas,2001-11-12 06:40:39-08:00,received

Here are my notes.  Did not yet have a chance to organize them, so they're simply in chronological order.  The call began with Watson, Bergstrom, and Whalley reading from prepared statements.  Watson spoke for c. 10 minutes, Bergstrom for 5, and Whalley spoke for perhaps 30 seconds.  Dynegy management was noticeably in control of the call.  Enron executives spoke when questions were directed to them.    Specific points: EES will be a part of the new company.   Enron assets will be revalued at closing.   The investment in Northern Natural takes the form of convertible preferred.  If the merger does not go through, Dynegy has the right to acquire Northern for 'very little' additional consideration.  If DYN terminates the merger and ENE 'has sufficient liquidity', ENE has right to repurchase the convertible preferred.   Debt/equity of combined company expected to be <45%. Both companies will remain on RatingsWatch negative.   ChevronTexaco will hold 169MM shares out of a total 650MM shares of the post-merger entity.   Watson reiterates that going forward, the new entity will be run with a focus on transparent and clear financial structure and disclosure, with a significant reduction in on- and off-balance-sheet leverage.   In what was termed a ""new approach"", the new entity will be run with a focus on cash flow rather than earnings.   Rumors that Dynegy did the deal because of an unhedged exposure to Enron are not true.  Dynegy owed Enron <$50MM.   Lay says that Enron had other options, 'particularly financial'. All of the discussion and activity has taken place over the last two weeks. Lay acknowledges that the number for exposure to securities lawsuits may be 'pretty big', but that the companies feel they're able to appropriately value this exposure. Lay says we have nothing else to hide, but internal investigation still under way.   Lay:  had the SPEs been capitalized with perhaps $30MM more of risk capital, there would have been no question that they would have qualified for off-balance-sheet treatment and there would have been no need to restate earnings last week to reflect consolidation of the SPEs. Dynegy says that 'several' internal investigations continue at Enron, and thus DYN/ENE cannot say with certainty that there's absolutely nothing else out there. Doty (Dynegy CFO) says that late last week, ENE had 'close to a billion' in cash.   Osprey will be unwound late next summer. Marlin will be unwound after closing. Many of the off-balance-sheet structures, including the credit-linked notes, are expected to be unwound/redeemed or at least significantly reduced prior to closing. With regard to ENE asset dispositions, these will be accelerated to the extent possible.  However, Doty says that 'our backs are not against the wall', and the company will continue to focus on getting value for its assets as well as cash. ENE will renew its 364-day facility (believe this is the $3Bn facility that we drew down a couple of weeks ago) within the next 6-8 weeks.   BBB-flat most likely rating for combined entity, according to initial comments from ratings agencies. McMahon says 'no comment' to WSJ article indicating that ENE's banks are preparing to make an equity infusion into ENE in the next few weeks. Consolidation of trading activity: Mid- and back-office consolidation will see substantial progress prior to closing, such that only the front office / trading books will need to be combined at closing.  EES, NNG and TW have no real overlap with existing DYN activity, so there won't be much integration work required there.  The big integration effort will be ENA. Watson says that the 'creative financing' surrounded non-core assets.  Doty adds that, 'frankly', DYN assigned zero economic value to non-core businesses in their valuation model.  They bracketed the maximum expected exposure from the non-core assets/businesses and left it at that. Watson mentions that DYN would not have gotten involved with Enron had they not been approached by 'Enron's top three executives', who said that they thought a combination with Dynegy made the most strategic sense for both companies.  Says that their approach evidenced a  willingness to work with DYN to integrate the two companies that made a big difference in Dynegy's deliberations on proceeding with the merger. Watson/Doty said that they're NOT 100% sure that no surprises remain in Enron's books--but that the risk/reward offered by the combination was compelling.  The deal does have material-adverse-change outs for Dynegy, covering any MAC regarding Enron's assets or businesses.  Dynegy's lawyers indicated that the MAC language was a 'blunt instrument' under which it would be difficult to bring a case, so Dynegy inserted a specific paragraph that gives Dynegy the right to terminate the merger if the Enron's total legal liability (from any source or cause of action) tops $3.5Bn prior to closing. McMahon adds that there 'could' be more restatements, but he 'does not expect' there to be more restatements. ENE international hard assets definitely on the asset disposition list. The merger structure calls for a new entity to take over Enron. Enron is planning to hold an Enron-specific conference call in the next few days, tentatively scheduled for Wednesday. Initial reaction of ratings agencies 'very positive' to combined entities.   McMahon acknowledges that Enron would have had to have an additional equity infusion prior to year-end, had the merger not materialized. Dynegy's earnings guidance places Enron-related earnings accretion at $0.90-0.95, which represents a '25% haircut' to Enron internal estimates.  Doty says that this is all operating earnings--figure does not include any amounts from expected synergies. Doty says that both Enron and Dynegy's books, as far as he understands, are relatively short-term in weight, and this will continue to be the weighting of the new entity.  Says a 'very very substantial' portion of future trading earnings will be expected to be cash. ChevronTexaco's investment in Dynegy was calculated at a 5% discount to public prices on the date of negotiation (not disclosed).  Given the runup in Dynegy stock last week, ChevronTexaco's investment is now at a 'more substantial' discount to market prices.  ChevronTexaco has provision to get 'different prices at closing if those prices are substantially better'.  (No further clarification given). Whalley believes that 'we'll retain' the Enron traders and marketers. They're used to being part of a winning team, and the combined entity will definitely be a winner.  They have talked with most of the Enron business leaders, and they are 'very excited' by the combination.  They will be working with the Enron business leaders to ensure talent is retained.  Whalley was asked if there will be any key employee retention provisions.  He says that 'to the extent necessary, yes.' Watson says that the trading strategy of the combined entity will be a combination of DYN and ENE--there will be more of an asset-backed trading focus, but by the same token the new Dynegy will be involved in much more financial market-making trading than the Dynegy of today. Watson says that if there were to be any change in culture, he's a strong team player.  He does not want to see an individual do well if the company or division does not do well.

Here are my notes.  Did not yet have a chance to organize them, so they're simply in chronological order.  The call began with Watson, Bergstrom, and Whalley reading from prepared statements.  Watson spoke for c. 10 minutes, Bergstrom for 5, and Whalley spoke for perhaps 30 seconds.  Dynegy management was noticeably in control of the call.  Enron executives spoke when questions were directed to them.    Specific points: EES will be a part of the new company.   Enron assets will be revalued at closing.   The investment in Northern Natural takes the form of convertible preferred.  If the merger does not go through, Dynegy has the right to acquire Northern for 'very little' additional consideration.  If DYN terminates the merger and ENE 'has sufficient liquidity', ENE has right to repurchase the convertible preferred.   Debt/equity of combined company expected to be <45%. Both companies will remain on RatingsWatch negative.   ChevronTexaco will hold 169MM shares out of a total 650MM shares of the post-merger entity.   Watson reiterates that going forward, the new entity will be run with a focus on transparent and clear financial structure and disclosure, with a significant reduction in on- and off-balance-sheet leverage.   In what was termed a ""new approach"", the new entity will be run with a focus on cash flow rather than earnings.   Rumors that Dynegy did the deal because of an unhedged exposure to Enron are not true.  Dynegy owed Enron <$50MM.   Lay says that Enron had other options, 'particularly financial'. All of the discussion and activity has taken place over the last two weeks. Lay acknowledges that the number for exposure to securities lawsuits may be 'pretty big', but that the companies feel they're able to appropriately value this exposure. Lay says we have nothing else to hide, but internal investigation still under way.   Lay:  had the SPEs been capitalized with perhaps $30MM more of risk capital, there would have been no question that they would have qualified for off-balance-sheet treatment and there would have been no need to restate earnings last week to reflect consolidation of the SPEs. Dynegy says that 'several' internal investigations continue at Enron, and thus DYN/ENE cannot say with certainty that there's absolutely nothing else out there. Doty (Dynegy CFO) says that late last week, ENE had 'close to a billion' in cash.   Osprey will be unwound late next summer. Marlin will be unwound after closing. Many of the off-balance-sheet structures, including the credit-linked notes, are expected to be unwound/redeemed or at least significantly reduced prior to closing. With regard to ENE asset dispositions, these will be accelerated to the extent possible.  However, Doty says that 'our backs are not against the wall', and the company will continue to focus on getting value for its assets as well as cash. ENE will renew its 364-day facility (believe this is the $3Bn facility that we drew down a couple of weeks ago) within the next 6-8 weeks.   BBB-flat most likely rating for combined entity, according to initial comments from ratings agencies. McMahon says 'no comment' to WSJ article indicating that ENE's banks are preparing to make an equity infusion into ENE in the next few weeks.

As with Monday, I've focused on getting them out as quickly as possible rather than taking extra time to re-organize them by subject.  Enron's business has been grouped into three buckets:  Core, Non-core, and Under Review.   Core:  Wholesale energy business in North America and Europe, retail energy, pipelines Non-core:  Broadband, water, and international assets (i.e. EGAS).  Enron has approx. $8Bn in investments in these assets, and they have produced 'dismal' returns.  Enron will be exiting these businesses and will attempt to wind them up in an orderly fashion.  An aggressive divestiture program has been set in motion for these assets.   Under Review:  EGM, EIM.  These businesses are being closely examined to determine whether they have a reasonable chance of long-term viability.  Required resource levels are being carefully studied.  Following review, Enron will move the different portions of these businesses to core or non-core as the analysis dictates.   Approximately $800MM of asset sales are under contract and expected to close in the fourth quarter.  These include a gas LDC in Brazil, EcoElectrica, and our Indian E&P assets.   Enron is in active pursuit of an additional private equity infusion of $500MM-1Bn.  Given the current environment, raising equity in the public markets would be 'inefficient', McMahon says. Short-term liquidity is provided by the $3Bn of credit drawn upon a few weeks ago, the $1Bn of new debt, and the $1.5Bn equity infusion from Dynegy.  Longer-term, the proceeds from the sale of PGE will provide liquidity.  Asset sales over the next year will be used to pay down debt. McMahon described the major off-balance-sheet vehicles: Marlin was set up to hold Azurix assets.  It was initially capitalized with $950MM of 144a debt and $125MM of equity (raised from Enron and institutional investors).  The debt is supported by the equity and by Azurix' assets.  Enron is obligated to cover any deficit at the time the debt becomes due on 3/17/03 (the 'Enron topup' obligation).  The 3/17/03 date is accelerated in the event that Enron is rated below-investment-grade by any one of the three major agencies.  The primary asset of Marlin is Wessex Water.  As long as Wessex is worth at least $2.6Bn, there will be no Enron topup required.  If we take a 25% haircut to present book value, Enron will have to provide $650MM in consideration upon retirement of the debt.  This $650MM would hit Enron cash, income, and equity balances.   Osprey contains energy-related assets and 'other assets'.  It was initially capitalized with $2.4Bn of 144a debt and $220MM in equity (ENE and institutionals).  As with Marlin, the entity is an asset-backed structure with an Enron topup guarantee. The debt is supported by a) the assets; b) $1Bn of convertible preferred ENE (convertible into 50MM shares of ENE common); and c) additional ENE common as needed for topup.  Assuming the same 25% hypothetical haircut to current book value, Enron would have to deliver approx. $600MM of topup funds--which would hit ENE cash, income, and equity.  The debt must be retired by 9/17/02, with the same cut-to-junk early trigger provision as Marlin.   Yosemite and the Credit-Linked Notes are predominantly commodity transactions entered into with 'large financial institutions'.  The underlying transactions are already on Enron's balance sheet.  McMahon says that there is no Enron share obligation related to these instruments. Dynegy has reviewed all of these vehicles, McMahon says. Our 10Q will be filed five days late.  The 10Q will include all of this detail regarding the off-balance-sheet vehicles. The special committee investigation is still ongoing.  The committee meets 2-3 times/week, sometimes more often.  The outside auditors (D&T) and external counsel hired by the committee are working 'virtually 7 days a week'.  Lay estimates that it will take the committee several more weeks to complete its investigation. McMahon says it's 'way too early to tell' if any asset writedowns are called for.  That analysis is underway, but it will not be complete for some time.   Osprey contains the European power projects (Trakya and Saarlux), some North American merchant investments, and some Brazilian assets.   Under the merger agreement, Enron cannot dispose of assets representing more than 15% of the balance sheet without Dynegy approval.  However, an appendix to the agreement holds a list of assets that are specifically permitted to be sold without Dynegy approval.   Broadband is expected to be fully wound up 'sometime over the course of the next year'.  (Did not catch this part clearly).   The ENE topup obligation for Marlin (represented by ENE common that would have to be delivered) will be converted into an obligation for an equivalent amount of DYN shares upon closing.   $1.9Bn of debt is carried at the Azurix level.   Current book value of the Osprey assets is $2.1Bn.   No Dynegy outs other than the previously discussed general MAC clause and the $3.5Bn legal liability clause.   Yosemite and the Credit-Linked notes are functionally equivalent to ENE senior unsecured debt (this section somewhat unclear).  The underlying transactions represented volumes of 'crude oil and gas'.  The transactions relate to the 'physical movement' of these commodities.  The swaps related to Yosemite and the CLNs would be financially settled.   Whalley was asked about the return of trading business to normal volumes.  He said that he cannot yet give an update on the progress of customers returning to our longer-term products.  Acknowledges that a few anxious customers put long-term deals on hold last week.  Says that our first focus is on getting our short-term business back up to normal levels.  It will be 'a couple of weeks' before we're able to give an update on the comfort levels of our customers regarding long-term deals with us.   McMahon:  There hasn't been a major relaxation of credit requirements by our customers--credit requirements continue to follow strict contractual provisions as called for in our individual agreements with our various customers.  But 'we have seen a return of some of the transactions, some of the flows.' Whalley says that we're hoping to see a return to more normal trading levels late this week or early next week. Lay says that cost cuts will be made across of all of our businesses.  The situation gives us an opportunity to review our entire cost structure, he says.  The cuts will certainly be deeper in our non-core businesses.  Whalley then quickly interjects (some might say interrrupts) with a clarification that there are no plans to reduce the size of our North American energy trading business.  We will be looking at, perhaps, streamlining some of our processes and making prudent adjustments, but there are no plans to reduce the size of the business. McMahon:  ""The company is overlevered; that's a fact.""--hence our pursuit of additional equity. McMahon mentions that business was better at the start of this week than at the end of last week. ENE had approx. $1Bn in cash as of 9/30, which McMahon points out would be unusual for us.    As before, give me a call at 3-3055 if you'd like more color.

As with Monday, I've focused on getting them out as quickly as possible rather than taking extra time to re-organize them by subject.  Enron's business has been grouped into three buckets:  Core, Non-core, and Under Review.   Core:  Wholesale energy business in North America and Europe, retail energy, pipelines Non-core:  Broadband, water, and international assets (i.e. EGAS).  Enron has approx. $8Bn in investments in these assets, and they have produced 'dismal' returns.  Enron will be exiting these businesses and will attempt to wind them up in an orderly fashion.  An aggressive divestiture program has been set in motion for these assets.   Under Review:  EGM, EIM.  These businesses are being closely examined to determine whether they have a reasonable chance of long-term viability.  Required resource levels are being carefully studied.  Following review, Enron will move the different portions of these businesses to core or non-core as the analysis dictates.   Approximately $800MM of asset sales are under contract and expected to close in the fourth quarter.  These include a gas LDC in Brazil, EcoElectrica, and our Indian E&P assets.   Enron is in active pursuit of an additional private equity infusion of $500MM-1Bn.  Given the current environment, raising equity in the public markets would be 'inefficient', McMahon says. Short-term liquidity is provided by the $3Bn of credit drawn upon a few weeks ago, the $1Bn of new debt, and the $1.5Bn equity infusion from Dynegy.  Longer-term, the proceeds from the sale of PGE will provide liquidity.  Asset sales over the next year will be used to pay down debt. McMahon described the major off-balance-sheet vehicles: Marlin was set up to hold Azurix assets.  It was initially capitalized with $950MM of 144a debt and $125MM of equity (raised from Enron and institutional investors).  The debt is supported by the equity and by Azurix' assets.  Enron is obligated to cover any deficit at the time the debt becomes due on 3/17/03 (the 'Enron topup' obligation).  The 3/17/03 date is accelerated in the event that Enron is rated below-investment-grade by any one of the three major agencies.  The primary asset of Marlin is Wessex Water.  As long as Wessex is worth at least $2.6Bn, there will be no Enron topup required.

Assuming the same 25% hypothetical haircut to current book value, Enron would have to deliver approx. $600MM of topup funds--which would hit ENE cash, income, and equity.  The debt must be retired by 9/17/02, with the same cut-to-junk early trigger provision as Marlin.   Yosemite and the Credit-Linked Notes are predominantly commodity transactions entered into with 'large financial institutions'.  The underlying transactions are already on Enron's balance sheet.  McMahon says that there is no Enron share obligation related to these instruments. Dynegy has reviewed all of these vehicles, McMahon says. Our 10Q will be filed five days late.  The 10Q will include all of this detail regarding the off-balance-sheet vehicles. The special committee investigation is still ongoing.  The committee meets 2-3 times/week, sometimes more often.  The outside auditors (D&T) and external counsel hired by the committee are working 'virtually 7 days a week'.  Lay estimates that it will take the committee several more weeks to complete its investigation. McMahon says it's 'way too early to tell' if any asset writedowns are called for.  That analysis is underway, but it will not be complete for some time.   Osprey contains the European power projects (Trakya and Saarlux), some North American merchant investments, and some Brazilian assets.   Under the merger agreement, Enron cannot dispose of assets representing more than 15% of the balance sheet without Dynegy approval.  However, an appendix to the agreement holds a list of assets that are specifically permitted to be sold without Dynegy approval.   Broadband is expected to be fully wound up 'sometime over the course of the next year'.  (Did not catch this part clearly).   The ENE topup obligation for Marlin (represented by ENE common that would have to be delivered) will be converted into an obligation for an equivalent amount of DYN shares upon closing.   $1.9Bn of debt is carried at the Azurix level.   Current book value of the Osprey assets is $2.1Bn.   No Dynegy outs other than the previously discussed general MAC clause and the $3.5Bn legal liability clause.   Yosemite and the Credit-Linked notes are functionally equivalent to ENE senior unsecured debt (this section somewhat unclear).  The underlying transactions represented volumes of 'crude oil and gas'.  The transactions relate to the 'physical movement' of these commodities.  The swaps related to Yosemite and the CLNs would be financially settled.   Whalley was asked about the return of trading business to normal volumes.  He said that he cannot yet give an update on the progress of customers returning to our longer-term products.  Acknowledges that a few anxious customers put long-term deals on hold last week.  Says that our first focus is on getting our short-term business back up to normal levels.  It will be 'a couple of weeks' before we're able to give an update on the comfort levels of our customers regarding long-term deals with us.   McMahon:  There hasn't been a major relaxation of credit requirements by our customers--credit requirements continue to follow strict contractual provisions as called for in our individual agreements with our various customers.  But 'we have seen a return of some of the transactions, some of the flows.' Whalley says that we're hoping to see a return to more normal trading levels late this week or early next week. Lay says that cost cuts will be made across of all of our businesses.  The situation gives us an opportunity to review our entire cost structure, he says.  The cuts will certainly be deeper in our non-core businesses.  Whalley then quickly interjects (some might say interrrupts) with a clarification that there are no plans to reduce the size of our North American energy trading business.  We will be looking at, perhaps, streamlining some of our processes and making prudent adjustments, but there are no plans to reduce the size of the business. McMahon:  ""The company is overlevered; that's a fact.""--hence our pursuit of additional equity. McMahon mentions that business was better at the start of this week than at the end of last week. ENE had approx. $1Bn in cash as of 9/30, which McMahon points out would be unusual for us.    As before, give me a call at 3-3055 if you'd like more color.

"Phillip,   I apologize that it has taken so long to send these to you.    Accomplishments:  1. Publish the IntraMonth (Physical) and Gas Daily Curves for the East Desk on a daily basis.    This involves communicating with the traders who mark the curves and checking for reasonableness for the spreads that are set.  I spend extra time before publishing making sure that the curves are correct so that they do not have to be re-published which can slow my co-workers down.  During Bid week, extra curve loading procedures are followed so that we can start publishing curves for the prompt month.    I also maintain the live feed from the Nymex screen to TDS so that the traders can see Live Curve Shift.  I make sure that all three curve files are updating and publishing correctly and communicate with Pete Keavey to constantly update the Cash/Futures spread (i.e. What the Hub is trading at.)  If TDS is not updating correctly, then it is my responsibility to fix the problem.  2.  Maintain the daily P&L for Gulf 3, Gulf 4, and Gulf 5.  These books contain both physical and financial pieces as well as options.  The main accomplishment in this area has been practicing the technique of hedging using Gas Daily Swaps to keep my trader flat when Gulf 5 was in use.  This was done on a daily basis for 2 months so that my trader, Chuck Ames, did not carry any positions.  It involved swaps and annuities between Gulf 4 and Gulf 5.  By the end of the month, Gulf 5 will be eliminated and the transfer of deals from Gulf 5 to Gulf 4 will be complete.  3.  Update the calc sheet for Enron's long term deal with Florida Power & Light.  I work on computing the desk price for this deal so that the variance between our Economic Estimate and what Unify Should Be is reduced to less than $100.  I check on all the different legs of the deal to make sure that the volumes in Sitara and Tagg are matching and therefore we are coming up with the correct amount for Total Liquidations.  Computing the desk price is an important piece to this deal and usually results in a net change of > $200,000 each month to my Gulf 4 book.  It used to take 2 full days each month of trial and error to compute the desk price until I computed the formula which only requires 2 guesses then will give you the true desk price eliminating any variance each time.  I shared this formula with Alejandra and it is now used in several calc sheets that Ed is currently working on since Alejandra left.  4.  Helped to create a new version of Weapon X.  James Hungerford and I worked together to create a new version of Weapon X that could be used regardless of whether the physical book has fuel expense or not.  This version (Weapon XY) can be used and adapted to fit every physical book within Natural Gas.  It reduced the number of versions that people were using from 9 to 1.  If needed, one person could run and export Weapon X for every physical book on their desk.  This saves time when you are running Weapon X for someone while they are out or on vacation.  I helped to install Weapon XY on the Central Desk and the West Desk and trained others how to use to the new version.   5.  Tie out the OA Flash tab for the Gulf Region on the East Desk at the end of each month.  On the First Day of the month, I make sure that the OA Flash tab for the gulf region (the books Gulf1, Gulf2, Gulf3, Gulf4, TP1, TP2, and Northeast) match what is expected for Transport Commodity and Demand Expense.  I gather the OA Flash tabs for all books and check for any variances.  I also communicate with Jeanne Wukasch in Logistics to make sure that these numbers are absolutely correct before saving out to the Last Day files.  This effort is done in an effort to prevent as much OA as possible.  Please let me know if you have any questions.

Bryan  (Taken from the Mobile Register)  Tub doing a lousy job  12/04/01      Walking into Tiger Stadium at dusk Saturday, amidst a whiskey river of LSU fans, a friend looked at me and screamed over the cacophony of chants:  ""I don't know what to make out of this game,"" he said. ""I don't know if I'm going to be more upset if we (Auburn) win or we get blown out again.""    <http://www.al.com/images/spacer.gif>  The meaning was clear: Under Thomas Hawley Tuberville, you never really know what you will find under the big tent, whether Dr. Jeckyl or Mr. Hyde?  Well, after three hours in the sea of debauchery better known as Death Valley, where fans, chomping (Tuberville induced) cigars and yelling profanities and vulgarities, it became crystalline where the state of Auburn football lies right now.  Under water.  Perhaps, the most amazing conclusion of the long evening on the Bayou is the Auburn football program actually has accomplished something I never dreamed possible: It showed less class than the LSU fans, who have earned a reputation as some of the worst in college football.  I had to laugh afterwards when Tuberville, with a straight face (he is a riverboat gambler, after all), talked about this program exceeding expectations with a 7-4 record. Give me a break. I picked Auburn to go 7-4 in this space on Aug. 14 and so did many others. Of course, nobody predicted this team would mail in several games without any effort.  On Saturday night, this football coaching staff was like the gang that couldn't shoot straight. A national television audience witnessed some of dumbest coaching decisions ever.  What a total lack of class for the Auburn players to be dancing on the LSU logo before the game. What has this group accomplished, other than winning a trip to a bowl game that no one cares about? What about the totally classless act of the kicking team getting in the way of the LSU marching band at the end of halftime? One is tempted to criticize the players. But in the end, you really can't.  They are just a manifestation of a head football coach, whose frat-boy smile about everything and inability to get the bigger pictures has a trickle down effect on everyone -- especially the players. Tuberville always talks -- doe-eyed -- about his mentor Jimmy Johnson. Apparently, some of the Johnson mystique has really rubbed off, when it comes to classlessness and thug behavior.  Tuberville loses by 24 to Alabama and instead of taking the blame, he makes fun of the opposing coach for starting the wrong quarterback all year. Nine days later, he finally apologizes to the Auburn family, that is, in a mea culpa that reeked of Bill Clinton during the Monica Lewinsky affair.  This is a head football coach being paid $1.3 million a year. But if you think Tuberville earned his money this year, think again. And word is he can't believe the unhappiness in the ranks. He wonders how people can turn on him after the job he has done.  What has he done?  In three years, he has gone 5-6, 9-4 and now 7-4. Add it up: 21-14 (.600). Bob Davie got fired Sunday for going .583 at Notre Dame. Of course, among those 21 wins are victories against Appalachian State, Idaho, Central Florida, Wyoming, Northern Illinois, Ball State, Louisiana Tech (twice) and Vanderbilt (twice). That's a total of 10 wins against an industrial-sized pack of creampuffs. So in legitimate games, he is actually 11-14.  Tub is 1-2 against Alabama (1-6 lifetime) and in the last 13 games, managed to lose five by double digits (Florida by 21, Syracuse by 17, Arkansas by 25, Alabama by 24 and LSU by 13). Does that give some clue there is a problem?  Of those 14 losses Tub has suffered at Auburn, 10 have been by double digits. At Ole Miss, Tuberville's overall record was 25-20. Of the 20 losses, 14 were double digits. Among those 25 wins, Tuberville beat such heavyweights as Indiana State, Tulane (twice), Memphis (twice), Idaho State, VMI, Arkansas State (twice), Central Florida, SMU (twice) and Vanderbilt (four times).  So, if you look at it objectively (the school was hampered by NCAA limitations), against legitimate teams, his record was 9-20.  Of his current squad, Tuberville talks of them being young. Well, Tommy, enough already, please. This is your third year. If you can't stand the heat, call your agent and tell him to find you a new job. I'm sure there's a big market for a coach who has done as lousy a job as he has in the past few weeks.  The funniest rumor last week going concerned Tub replacing Nick Saban of LSU (they share the same agent), believed to be heading to the Indianapolis Colts. Based on what I heard Saturday night in the Bayou, LSU fans would burn Tiger Stadium to a crisp before accepting Tub as their head coach.  Assuming Tub graces Auburn with his presence next season (everyone please, cross your fingers in unison and hold your breath!), he faces a critical recruiting class and pivotal slate of games. I still think he is a capable head coach. But things must change.  Before the Iron Bowl, there was a lot of talk about how the pendulum in the state had shifted. And the prognosticators were correct. Except they missed one important element. The pendulum has shifted in this series -- toward Alabama. Despite all the hardship and distractions, Dennis Franchione appears to have Alabama heading in the right direction on all sides of the ledger -- including style and class.  Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for Tommy Tuberville and his Auburn football program.

Attached are positions open and listed through HFMA's Exec-u-Trak  Confidential Resume Referral Service. This list is sent to you monthly for your  information and distribution to Chapter membership via meetings, newsletters  and/or your web site. Because Chapters change many leadership positions, if  there is a more appropriate person in your Chapter that should also receive this  information, please let us know by name, email address and Chapter.   Many organizations are in process of finalizing their recruitment plans and  budgets. We wanted to remind you of The Healthcare Financial Management's  Exec-u-Trak's annual option that will allow organizations unlimited access to  the program. This is more cost effective than individual ads or other  independent actions, especially if staffing plans call for at least two  recruitment efforts.  We have attached some preliminary information to review share with members  and Human Resources professionals.  HFMA's Exec-u-Trak has over 2500 members in its database, presented more than  120 positions this year and continues to serve both members and organizations in  the recruitment process.

"I have tried to contact you guys three times today and have been on hold each time at least 20 minutes.  I cancelled my service with you over a month ago and asked that you keep from sending me a bill.  My service was cancelled immediately and I was told I would receive a bill from you and I would then have to call and dispute the bill to have my account credited.  I asked at that time since I had waited on hold that time for 30 minutes that this matter be taken care of immediately so that I would not have to call back and sit on hold again for half an hour.  Your customer service manager, very rudely I might add,  said that was impossible and I would just have to do it anyway.  Since I have had to wait on hold today for so long I want this email to serve as my dispute and have my account closed and the balance due removed since you terminated my service and I did not get the use of my phone.    Just a word of advice, I would hire more customer service representatives if you plan on keeping customer to serve.  This is by far the worst customer service experience I have ever had with a company and I will make sure all of my colleagues and friends know of this experience.  I understand that you don't really care about giving good customer service to your ex customers, but I assure you make a fatal error when you assume those people will not share there experience with current and future potential customers.

"Attached is the curve file for phys and gas daily.  I made this extremely simple on our first pass, but I left in the tabs that were in the old/current file.  All you would do would be to go to the fin tab and hard code balance of month price for each of the curve locations(yellow column).  This will then set the gas daily curve.  We will continue to true up to gas daily each day.  You may want to also reset the next day's curve as well, since this is a hardcode, you simply type over the previous day's load.  The phys tab pulls from the fin tab and adds the phys prem to it.  We can increase the complexity of this file by adding formulas or tabs if you like.  I figure you will want to keep your model and I can pull info from there as well.  I simply wanted to start out at a baseline and build it to best fit your needs.  Please let me know what you would like to see changed and we will do it.  Thanks. PL  ",mike.grigsby@enron.com,m..love@enron.com,phys/gd curve file,2002-01-14 12:20:54-08:00,sent

"The West books should be GD and GDY for Canadian deals.  I would think that the central books should have two set up, one for P/B/I and one for GD.

Subject: New NETCO books  Phillip/Kam,  The following new Canadian gas books are all assigned to ""MC"" but a canadian book can either be price/basis/index or gasdaily but it cannot be both (otherwise cause problems in PortCalc).  I remember we discussed about this last time and I was told to use FT-ONTARIO as the example, but there are a lot of FT-ONTARIO books like FT-ONT-CENTRAL and FT-ONT-GDL with different setup.    For example, 166860 has all P/B/Idx/GD checked which it shouldn't be.  And 166859 has GD checked so does it mean it should be set up as a Canadian gasdaily book?  Then if 166860 - 166877 are Canadian price/basis/index, another book code should be assigned instead of using MC.  Please advise.

Sent: Monday, January 14, 2002 2:21 PM To: Grigsby, Mike Subject: phys/gd curve file  Attached is the curve file for phys and gas daily.  I made this extremely simple on our first pass, but I left in the tabs that were in the old/current file.  All you would do would be to go to the fin tab and hard code balance of month price for each of the curve locations(yellow column).  This will then set the gas daily curve.  We will continue to true up to gas daily each day.  You may want to also reset the next day's curve as well, since this is a hardcode, you simply type over the previous day's load.  The phys tab pulls from the fin tab and adds the phys prem to it.  We can increase the complexity of this file by adding formulas or tabs if you like.  I figure you will want to keep your model and I can pull info from there as well.  I simply wanted to start out at a baseline and build it to best fit your needs.  Please let me know what you would like to see changed and we will do it.  Thanks.

I have you down for $61 plus shipping, not $1,600.  I show that you bid at $6.99 and at $61.  There was no bid for $19.99 listed at all.  I am sorry if you did not mean to bid $61, but it is hardly out of the range - these balls were selling this weekend for $80-90.  If your winning bid was $200 or higher I could understand your complaint and we could make an adjustment, but $61 is not an unreasonable amount.  Please let me know if you are planning on paying the $61(I will pay shipping if you use PayPal).  If not, I need to contact EBay for resolution.  I need a response as soon as possible.  Thanks.

I would suggest you take it up with EBay.  See my attachment regarding EBay's policy on Non Paying Bidder.  I have tried to contact the person that you outbid - the person that bid $60.  He has not responded.  I would suggest you try and contact him to have him pay for the item at his highest bid.  I have bid on items before on EBay and it clearly asks you twice to confirm your bidding amount.  I would be more than willing to change your payment if the price got way out of wack.  $61 is actually cheaper than some of the balls were going for this weekend.  I hope the person that bid $60 will respond and ""get you off the hook"".  Otherwise, EBay will have to intervene on your behalf.  I guess it is possible, their system messed up, but it looks like you approved a bad bid.  Sorry.  Good luck.

I have you down for $61 plus shipping, not $1,600.  I show that you bid    at    $6.99 and at $61.  There was no bid for $19.99 listed at all.  I am    sorry if    you did not mean to bid $61, but it is hardly out of the range - these    balls    were selling this weekend for $80-90.  If your winning bid was $200 or    higher I could understand your complaint and we could make an    adjustment,    but $61 is not an unreasonable amount.  Please let me know if you are    planning on paying the $61(I will pay shipping if you use PayPal).  If    not,    I need to contact EBay for resolution.  I need a response as soon as    possible.

"As I said, take it up with EBay or the individual you outbid.  I see your max bid says $1600, an obvious mistake that you had to approve unless EBay made a mistake.  For the last time $61 is obviously not out of the price range for those balls this weekend, you won by a dollar.  You can cancel your bid before the auction ends and you did not.  Per the attachment I sent, you have another 5 days to decide to pay or get Ebay to adjust it or I will seek payment through them.

I would suggest you take it up with EBay.  See my attachment regarding EBay's policy on Non Paying Bidder.  I have tried to contact the person that you outbid - the person that bid $60.  He has not responded.  I would suggest you try and contact him to have him pay for the item at his highest bid.  I have bid on items before on EBay and it clearly asks you twice to confirm your bidding amount.  I would be more than willing to change your payment if the price got way out of wack.  $61 is actually cheaper than some of the balls were going for this weekend.  I hope the person that bid $60 will respond and ""get you off the hook"".  Otherwise, EBay will have to intervene on your behalf.  I guess it is possible, their system messed up, but it looks like you approved a bad bid.  Sorry.  Good luck.

I have you down for $61 plus shipping, not $1,600.  I show that you bid    at    $6.99 and at $61.  There was no bid for $19.99 listed at all.  I am    sorry if    you did not mean to bid $61, but it is hardly out of the range - these    balls    were selling this weekend for $80-90.  If your winning bid was $200 or    higher I could understand your complaint and we could make an    adjustment,    but $61 is not an unreasonable amount.  Please let me know if you are    planning on paying the $61(I will pay shipping if you use PayPal).  If    not,    I need to contact EBay for resolution.  I need a response as soon as    possible.

"     Bill Gates' speech, love him or hate him, comes pretty close to hitting the nail on the head with this--especially for parents of teenagers!  To anyone with kids of any age, or anyone who has ever been a kid, here's some advice Bill Gates recently dished out at a high school speech about 11 things they did not learn in school.  He talks about how feel-good politically correct teachings created a full generation of kids with no concept of reality and how this concept set them up for failure in the real world.  Here's what he said:  Rule 1: Life is not fair--get used to it.  Rule 2: The world won't care about your self-esteem.  The world will expect you to accomplish something BEFORE you feel good about yourself.  Rule 3: You will NOT make 40 thousand dollars a year right out of high school.  You won't be a vice-president with a car phone, until you earn both.  Rule 4: If you think your teacher is tough, wait till you get a boss.  He doesn't have tenure.  Rule 5: Flipping burgers is not beneath your dignity.  Your grandparents had a different word for burger flipping--they called it opportunity.  Rule 6: If you mess up, it's not your parents' fault, so don't whine about your mistakes, learn from them.  Rule 7: Before you were born, your parents weren't as boring as they are now.  They got that way from paying your bills; cleaning your clothes and listening to you talk about how cool you are.  So before you save the rain forest from the parasites of your parents' generation, try delousing the closet in your own room.  Rule 8: Your school may have done away with winners and losers but life has not.  In some schools they have abolished failing grades and they'll give you as many times, as you want to get the right answer. This doesn't bear the slightest resemblance to ANYTHING in real life.  Rule 9: Life is not divided into semesters.  You don't get summers off and very few employers are interested in helping you find yourself.  You have to do that on your own time.  Rule 10: Television is NOT real life.  In real life people actually have to leave the coffee shop and go to jobs.  Rule 11: Be nice to nerds.  Chances are you'll end up working for one.

"      Brian invited his mother over for dinner. During the course of the meal, Brian's mother couldn't help but keep noticing how beautiful Brian's roommate, Stephanie, was. Mrs. Hester had long been suspicious of a relationship between Brian and his roomate Stephanie, and this had only made her more curious. Over the course of the evening, while watching the two interact, Mrs. Hester started to wonder if there was more between Brian and his roommate, Stephanie, than met the eye. Reading his mom's thoughts, Brian volunteered, ""I know what you must be thinking, but I assure you Stephanie and I are just roommates.""  About a week later, Stephanie came to Brian saying, ""Ever since your mother came to dinner, I've been unable to find the beautiful silver gravy ladle. You don't suppose she took it, do you?"" Brian answered, ""Well, I doubt it, but I'll send her an e-mail just to be sure."" So he sat down and wrote:  ""Dear Mother, I'm not saying that you 'did' take the gravy ladle from the house, I'm not saying that you 'did not' take the gravy ladle. But the fact remains that one has been missing ever since you were here for dinner."" Several days later, Brian received a letter from his mother that read:  Dear son, I'm not saying that you 'do' sleep with Stephanie, and I'm not saying that you 'do not' sleep with Stephanie. But the fact remains that if she was sleeping in her own bed, she would have found the gravy ladle by now.""

We need to get him access to TDS and this requires a TAGG login.  Bob will be trading on the NW desk under Mike Grigsby effective Monday March 11th.  Can you please process this request by tomorrow.  Please let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks. PL","mike.grigsby@enron.com, robert.badeer@enron.com",m..love@enron.com,FW: Access to TAGG,2002-03-08 08:22:23-08:00,sent
