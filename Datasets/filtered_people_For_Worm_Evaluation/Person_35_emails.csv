Outside Counsel       - Who are the top firms we are using?       -Should there be a data base for firms we are using(and particular  attorneys in the firm)and for what.       -Could/should the data base include info on fees paid to firms in the  previous year so we know who the top firms are and also so we have an idea  how much we pay in legal fees on an Enron wide basis.      -What position do we take on probable fee increases toi cover the  tremendous salary increases that firms recently gave to their associates?   2.Legal Web Page  Should we develop a Legal Group web page that has some of the info mentioned  immediately above. We could also use this to pass on info re vacancies,  announcements of new hires. This could also have a short bio on each attorney  including in particular any particular expertise that the attorney may have  so if someone has a question on swaps or Hart Scott or DOT regulations you  could look inhouse first for answers to questions rather than picking up the  phone and calling outside counsel for the answer to simple questions.   3.Summer Clerks  Should we have a centralized program for summer clerks?    4. Recruiting  Should we try to somewhat centralize this process or at a minimum set up a  mechanism for letting the various groups know of good candidates that have  been interviewed but not hired because of too many strong candidates for 1  position.   5. Management Succession  I think we should develop a process for identifying/evaluating individuals  who currently possess( or with some specific development could possess) the  capability of moving into the ""management "" ranks of the legal function Enron  wide. Thus when a vacancy does occur we have an idea of who are the persons  who merit consideration from across the corporation to help ensure we are  getting the best person for the job.   6. One Enron- since the corporate theme is ""one Enron"" what can or should we  be doing to make sure that happens.

Outside Counsel fees; 2. Recruitment and retention of lawyers and the impact of recent increases in  salaries elsewhere; 3.

Are we facing an increased risk of investigation worldwide e.g. FCPA,  other regualtory issues and are we doing enough to deal with these risks? 6. Technology - as the company becomes more and more e-commerce and  technologically advanced, is the legal department keeping up e.g. should  lawyers be more  computer literate, do we need to send them on courses etc?

"Fri, 18 Aug 2000 14:13:09  You have been  added to the CORPGEN mailing list  (Committee of Corporate General Counsel  of the Business  Law Section) by BLS  List Administrator <bllserve@ABANET.ORG>.  Please save this message for future  reference, especially if this is the first time you are subscribing to an electronic mailing list. If you ever need to leave  the list, you will find the  necessary instructions below. Perhaps  more importantly,  saving a  copy of  this message  (and of  all future subscription notices  from other mailing lists) in  a special mail folder will give you instant access to the list of mailing lists that you are subscribed  to. This may  prove very useful the  next time you  go on vacation and  need to leave  the lists temporarily so  as not to  fill up your  mailbox while  you  are away!  You should  also  save the  ""welcome messages"" from the  list owners that you will  occasionally receive after subscribing to a new list.  To send  a message to  all the people  currently subscribed to  the list, just send mail  to CORPGEN@MAIL.ABANET.ORG. This is  called ""sending mail to the  list,"" because  you send  mail to a  single address  and LISTSERV makes  copies  for all  the  people  who  have subscribed.  This  address (CORPGEN@MAIL.ABANET.ORG)  is also  called the  ""list address.""  You must never try to send any command to that address, as it would be distributed to all the people  who have subscribed. All commands must  be sent to the ""LISTSERV  address,"" LISTSERV@MAIL.ABANET.ORG.  It is  very important  to understand  the difference  between the  two, but  fortunately it  is not complicated. The LISTSERV address is like  a FAX number that connects you to  a machine,  whereas the  list  address is  like a  normal voice  line connecting you to a person. If you make a mistake and dial the FAX number when you wanted to talk to someone on the phone, you will quickly realize that you  used the wrong  number and call again.  No harm will  have been done. If on the other hand  you accidentally make your FAX call someone's voice  line,  the  person  receiving the  call  will  be  inconvenienced, especially if your FAX then re-dials  every 5 minutes. The fact that most people will eventually connect the FAX machine to the voice line to allow the FAX  to go through  and make  the calls stop  does not mean  that you should continue to send FAXes to  the voice number. People would just get mad at you.  It works pretty much  the same way with  mailing lists, with the difference  that you are calling  hundreds or thousands of  people at the same  time, and consequently  you can expect a  lot of people  to get upset if you consistently send commands to the list address.  You may leave the list at any time by sending a ""SIGNOFF CORPGEN"" command to LISTSERV@MAIL.ABANET.ORG. You  can also tell LISTSERV how  you want it to confirm the  receipt of messages you  send to the list. If  you do not trust the  system, send a ""SET  CORPGEN REPRO"" command and  LISTSERV will send  you a  copy of  your own  messages, so  that you  can see  that the message was distributed and did not get damaged on the way. After a while you  may find  that this  is getting  annoying, especially  if your  mail program does not  tell you that the  message is from you  when it informs you that new  mail has arrived from  CORPGEN. If you send  a ""SET CORPGEN ACK  NOREPRO"" command,  LISTSERV will  mail you  a short  acknowledgement instead, which will  look different in your mailbox  directory. With most mail programs you  will know immediately that this  is an acknowledgement you can read later. Finally, you can turn off acknowledgements completely with ""SET CORPGEN NOACK NOREPRO"".  Following  instructions from  the list  owner, your  subscription options have been  set to ""REPRO""  rather than  the usual LISTSERV  defaults. For more  information  about subscription  options,  send  a ""QUERY  CORPGEN"" command to LISTSERV@MAIL.ABANET.ORG.  Contributions sent to this list are automatically archived. You can get a list of the available archive files by sending an ""INDEX CORPGEN"" command to LISTSERV@MAIL.ABANET.ORG. You  can then order these files  with a ""GET CORPGEN LOGxxxx"" command, or using LISTSERV's database search facilities. Send an ""INFO DATABASE"" command for more information on the latter.  This  list is  available  in digest  form.  If you  wish  to receive  the digested  version  of the  postings,  just  issue  a SET  CORPGEN  DIGEST command.  Please note that  it is presently possible for other  people to determine that  you are  signed up  to the  list through  the use  of the  ""REVIEW"" command,  which  returns   the  e-mail  address  and  name   of  all  the subscribers. If  you do not  want your name to  be visible, just  issue a ""SET CORPGEN CONCEAL"" command.  More  information on  LISTSERV  commands  can be  found  in the  LISTSERV reference  card, which  you can  retrieve  by sending  an ""INFO  REFCARD"" command to LISTSERV@MAIL.ABANET.ORG.",james.derrick@enron.com,listserv@mail.abanet.org,You have been added to the CORPGEN list,2000-08-18 07:13:00-07:00,received

McCutchen is a 300+ lawyer firm with its main office in San Francisco and offices in Los Angles, Palo Alto and Walnut Creek. The firm has a very strong reputation in major commercial litigation (antitrust, securities fraud etc) and technical and IP litigation. I believe ENA has worked with McCutchen in the past on some power plant matters. Rob Walters has worked closely with Chris Hockett (who I have also met) and has a very high opinion of his abilities. I concur that Chris (a 40ish commercial litigator) is a very impressive individual. David Balbanian, more senior than Chris, is apparently widely known as one of the leading commercial litigators in  Northern California. Establishing a relationship with David and Chris would give you the judgment and access I assume you would want. Let me know if I can provide any additional information.

If they decide not to renew for whatever reason, they should, at a  minimum, provide a runoff period or ""tail"" for the reporting of claims as a  result of wrongful acts committed while the coverage was in effect.  I will  leave the ""contractual commitment to renew"" to Mr. Lay and his attorneys.  2. As mentioned in my voice mail, the carriers are acceptable security.  We  were not provided enough information on i2 to comment on the adequacy of the  limit.  (We did note that Enron's program could apply as excess insurance if  Mr. Lay is serving at the request of Enron.)  3. The indemnity provided by an organisation to their D's and O's is normally  found in the Company by-laws.  If sued, the director or officer would first  seek protection from the Company's indemnity.  If the indemnity does not  respond, the claim is made directly against the insurance subject to the  policy terms and conditions.  Most D&O matters are covered by the company's   indemnity and the claim is subject to the deductible under the Corporate  reimbursement section of the  D&O policy.  Normally the ""direct coverage"" has  no deductible.   4. The contractual matter should be handled by counsel.  5. It is normal in this type policy for the application to form a part of the  policy.  ""Polling""  the D's and O's at renewal will at least ensure that all  claims are reported.    6. See comment #1 above.  7. Employees are covered only when they are sued along with a director or  officer, except for the  Employment Practices Coverage, where employees are  covered along with directors and officers.  Please call if you or Mr. Baird wish to discuss further.

This is a combination of my comments and Marcia Backus' comments, and in fact Marcia gets the vast bulk of the credit (I found out that she has considerable experience in this area). (1)  This is a claims made policy.  Apparently they are all this way. Ken should get a contractual commitment from the Company to renew the coverage upon its expiration or obtain new coverage that covers claims made after expiration of the policy but relating to periods when Ken served on the board. (2)  We didn't attempt to determine whether the amounts of coverage are adequate in light of the company's business or whether the carriers are solid; I suspect Jim Bouillion has far more expertise on those issues than we do. (3) See item E on page 23 of 26.  It appears that the effect of the language is that the $150,000 deductible applies if there's any case where the Company is required or permitted by law to indemnify Ken but for some reason (other than insolvency) it does not indemnify Ken.  This appears to be a provision designed by the insurance company to ensure that the Company doesn't say to Ken ""Hey, you'll be fine and we'll come out ahead if you agree that we won't indemnify you; you can just collect from the insurance company with no deductible, and we'll be better off because if we indemnify you we'll have a deductible.""  This provision may make sense from an insurance policy standpoint, but Ken ought to make sure he has a contractual commitment from the Company to indemnify him to the fullest extent permitted by law. (4)  Please note exclusion 19 on page 22 of 26.  This provision is designed to protect the insurance company by preventing the company from making money by suing a director and then letting the director collect from the insurance company.  Again, this points up that Ken needs a contractual commitment from the Company to indemnify him to the fullest extent permitted by law. (5)  The application for the policy is part of the policy, which apparently means that if there was something wrong with the application the policy itself may be void, not only against the Company that applied for the policy but also against innocent insureds such as Ken. (6) The policy confers on the parent company the authority to cancel the policy on behalf of the beneficiaries at any time.  Ken should get a contractual commitment from the Company not to cancel the policy without obtaining substitute coverage that is at least as good. (7)   The policy provides insurance for employees as well as officers and directors, which dilutes the coverage somewhat. Generally, this appears to us to be an ok policy.  I would be very interested in knowing whether Jim Bouillion disagrees with that assessment.  Robert S. Baird Vinson & Elkins L.L.P.

In summary, the note says we see no major issue legal that cause us to advise Enron not to endorse the Principles, but that we do see a number of significant matters that Enron should consider before it makes a decision to endorse them.  There are two other items in addition to those mentioned in the note:     In regards to e-mails we exchanged yesterday regarding the fact that    these Principles are targeted at the extractive industry peer group that    Enron tries to distinguish itself from and is largely exiting, I    understand that Vicki will be contacting Kelly to discuss your    suggestions  on differentiating Enron from those industries.    It is not clear whether the decision to endorse the Principles must be    made by the full Enron board or some level short of the Enron board.  I    think Vicki will be discussing that with Rob.

These change= s=20 are intended to accomplish four key objectives:  First, we need to realign all our wholesale businesses around the successfu= l=20 business model developed over the last decade in North America and Europe. = =20 This model relies on extensive physical and transactional networks built=20 around a relatively small strategic asset position.  Second, we need to significantly streamline corporate reporting=20 relationships.  Particularly with Joe Sutton=01,s departure, the ability to= =20 directly manage the day-to-day activities of 15 independent business units= =20 has become increasingly difficult.  Third, we need to accomplish these changes without, in any way, compromisin= g=20 the ongoing profitability of all our businesses and without delaying or=20 hindering our effort to monetize a significant portion of our lower-yieldin= g=20 asset positions.  And fourth, as always, we need to take advantage of the reorganization to= =20 redeploy our talent into our highest value opportunities.  ENRON WHOLESALE SERVICES  Today, we are forming Enron Wholesale Services (EWS) which will consolidate= =20 our global wholesale businesses.  The closer alignment of our wholesale=20 businesses will accomplish the following: (1) enhanced communication and=20 coordination across business units, (2) more rapid deployment of people to= =20 higher valued opportunities, (3) more effective prioritization of=20 opportunities across the wholesale business, and (4) more rapid extension o= f=20 Enron=01,s wholesale business model and capabilities into new industries an= d=20 markets.  Enron Wholesale Services will include our current North American, European= =20 (including Japan and Australia), Global Markets, and Industrial Markets=20 operations, and will be expanded to include Enron=01,s Net Works business u= nit=20 as well as a new unit =01) Enron Global Assets.  In addition, Enron=01,s me= rchant=20 businesses outside of North America and Europe will be integrated into this= =20 new structure as described below.  Mark Frevert, currently Chairman of each of our wholesale units, will assum= e=20 the role of Chairman and CEO of Enron Wholesale Services.  Greg Whalley,=20 currently Chairman and CEO of Enron Net Works, will join Mark in the Office= =20 of the Chairman as President and Chief Operating Officer.  Providing further impetus for these organizational changes, several of our= =20 international business unit leaders have elected to move into new leadershi= p=20 positions:  Rebecca McDonald, currently CEO of Enron APACHI, will join EWS as President= =20 and CEO of Enron Global Assets. Enron Global Assets will have responsibilit= y=20 for managing all of Enron=01,s existing energy asset portfolio outside of N= orth=20 America and Europe.  Joining Rebecca in the Office of the Chairman as COO= =20 will be Jim Hughes, currently COO of Enron APACHI.  Rebecca and Jim will=20 report to the EWS Office of the Chairman.  Sanjay Bhatnagar, currently CEO of Enron India, has joined EBS as CEO for t= he=20 Middle East and Asia region.  Sanjay will be responsible for building our= =20 broadband business in this region and the current EBS team in this region= =20 will report to Sanjay.  In this role, Sanjay will report to the EBS office = of=20 the Chairman.  In addition, Sanjay will continue to remain responsible for= =20 Enron=01,s wholesale energy business in India and will transition this busi= ness=20 into Enron Global Assets in the near future. =20 Diomedes Christodoulou, currently Co-CEO of Enron South America, has joined= =20 EBS as Chief Commercial Officer.  Diomedes will be located in London and wi= ll=20 focus his origination activities on global opportunities, with near term=20 attention to the wholesale and enterprise sectors.  Diomedes will report to= =20 the EBS Office of the Chairman.  Jim Bannantine, currently Co-CEO of Enron South America, will be joining EE= S=20 to lead EES=01, commercial efforts outside North America and Europe.  In or= der=20 to ensure a smooth transition for our South American businesses and to=20 facilitate our asset sales activities, Jim will remain in South America for= =20 at least the next several months and continue to serve as CEO of Enron Sout= h=20 America.  Throughout the transition, Jim will report to Cliff Baxter and to= =20 the Office of the Chairman of Enron Wholesale Services.  Following the=20 transition, Jim will join EES.  In addition to these changes in our international asset operations=20 activities, we are making the following changes in our merchant wholesale= =20 businesses and the commercial support functions:  Enron Net Works Louise Kitchen will assume Greg=01,s previous responsibilities as President=  and=20 CEO of Enron Net Works, reporting into Mark and Greg. =20  Enron Americas Concurrent with the transfer to Enron Global Assets of responsibility for= =20 operating Enron=01,s South and Central America asset base, all trading,=20 marketing, and new asset development activities in these regions will repor= t=20 into a new entity, Enron Americas.  Enron Americas will have responsibility= =20 for all wholesale merchant businesses across North, Central and South=20 America.

Enron Europe The Enron Europe organization, which includes Enron=01,s businesses in Aust= ralia=20 and Japan, and Enron Metals, remains unchanged under the leadership of John= =20 Sherriff, President and CEO, and Michael Brown, Chief Operating Officer.  Enron Global Markets Enron Global Markets, under the leadership of Mike McConnell, President and= =20 CEO, and Jeff Shankman, Chief Operating Officer, will continue to have=20 responsibility for Enron=01,s Middle East and LNG operations.  With the=20 exception of Ecoelectrica in Puerto Rico, all operating power plants and=20 associated personnel in the Caribbean and Central America will transfer to= =20 Enron Global Assets.

Enron Industrial Markets Enron Industrial Markets=01, organization, under the leadership of Jeff McM= ahon,=20 President & CEO, and Ray Bowen, Chief Operating Officer, remains unchanged.  Commercial Support for EWS The commercial support functions for EWS will remain with, and be managed b= y,=20 the individual business units.  We are creating no incremental overhead in= =20 the creation of EWS, and in fact hope to reduce our operating costs by more= =20 efficient utilization and sharing of resources across EWS.  To this end we have asked several people to take on an expanded role across= =20 EWS in addition to their ongoing roles within their business units.  These= =20 newly defined roles are as follows:  Mid and Back Office Operations =01) Sally Beck will lead Mid and Back Offic= e=20 Operations across EWS.  These services will become part of Enron Net Works,= =20 with Sally reporting to Louise Kitchen and Rick Causey, Executive Vice=20 President and Chief Accounting Officer.  This alignment creates a coordinat= ed=20 services organization with IT and e-commerce platforms to support the=20 wholesale businesses and to maximize opportunities to commercialize these= =20 services.  Mid and Back Office services for all commercial activities will= =20 continue to be organized with dedicated operations controllers responsible= =20 for specific commodities and/or geographic locations.

Bureau investigator David Bloom alleges in an application for a warrant he used to gain access to the offices that in the summer of 1999, Powerex and Enron were coordinating bid restatements and inflating the price each received for electricity as they traded on the Power Pool of Alberta.   The investigation hasn't yet produced any charges against either of the companies, according to Enron. The Competition Bureau declined to comment on the status of the case.   Both Enron Corp. (ENE), which owns Enron Canada, and Powerex, a unit of provincially owned British Columbia Hydro & Power Authority (X.BCH), deny breaking any rules or laws.   From Powerex's point of view, Albertans are looking for someone to blame for high power prices, which have become a political issue in the province.   ""They just find it easy to blame us for what are pretty fundamental market design flaws,"" Powerex president and chief executive Ken Peterson told Dow Jones Newswires in an interview.    Deregulation Spurs Search For Someone To Blame   The search for someone to blame has repeated itself across every  deregulating market Enron has participated in, Enron Corp. spokesman Mark Palmer said.   ""Almost every time that either power markets or natural gas markets or even oil markets or gasoline markets have experienced any kind of price volatility, there have been investigations done,"" Palmer said.   Enron has been scrutinized before as part of wider energy markets investigations, he said, but never found to be breaking the rules. This is the first such investigation into Powerex's actions, Peterson said.   The Competition Bureau, based in Ottawa, won't say whether the investigaion is ongoing, citing disclosure rules under the Competition Act.   The companies themselves said they're not sure of the investigation's  status. Their seized files were returned several months ago, but Powerex hasn't heard from the Bureau since then. Enron did receive a call from the Bureau last week with a question, according to Enron Corp. spokesman Eric Thode.   The investigation began when the Power Pool of Alberta's system controllers noticed the clearing price for a megawatt of electricity was topping C$100  with unusual frequency.   The Pool's price is set by participants submitting bids to buy or sell power for the following day. Until Oct. 19, 1999, a bidder could restate the amount of power in a bid or offer an unlimited number of times, until 20 minutes before the hour of transmission. The price paid for every megawatt of power needed by the Pool in a given hour is set by the most expensive unit needed to meet demand.    Alleged Bid Rigging Methods Detailed   According to the Competition Bureau search warrant application, Powerex and Enron were rigging their bids in the following manner:   Powerex would lower the volume of an existing offer. As little as two  minutes later, Enron would increase its offer for the same period by the same volume, but at a ""significantly higher price,"" according to the warrant application. Sometimes, Enron would increase its offer even before Powerex had dropped its offer.   Power Pool market analyst Owen Craig, who once worked in Enron Canada's gas trading group, found that ""as a result of restatements, involving mostly Powerex and Enron,"" the Pool price was raised once to C$200/MWh, four times to between C$354.29 and C$499.93, three times to between C$500 and C$541.63, and 10 times to between C$801.02 and C$998.   Based on the restatement patterns, Craig, and then the Bureau's Bloom, concluded that no new energy was being offered to the Pool. They believed the power was just being transferred from Powerex to Enron and then offered at the higher price, according to the warrant application. By cutting the volume offered by Powerex, the more expensive power offered by Enron would likely be needed, and every participant would get the higher price.   Powerex's Peterson doesn't take issue with the trade history as detailed by the Bureau, but denies that the company's traders were doing anything wrong or that the two companies had some sort of arrangement.   ""And we're adamant about that,"" Peterson said. ""There was no deal with  Enron. There was no expectation about what their behavior would lead to in terms of a change in prices or anything like that.""   Powerex traders were merely locking in their price, cutting the company's risk, which Enron agreed to take on by buying the power at a fixed price, Peterson said.   ""Whenever Enron's offer of high-priced energy was declined, within moments  of Enron being advised by the Pool that their energy would not be required, Powerex would restate an identical volume of energy back into its lower priced unit,"" according to the warrant application.   Peterson's response: ""We're operating in a very tight market there and we felt an obligation to make sure the power got delivered into Alberta.""   Enron also denies it broke any Power Pool rules or Canadian laws.   ""It boils down to we were offered power at a price lower than we thought we could sell it at,"" Enron's Thode said. ""And that's what Enron and every other company does that's in the business of trading.""   The May 25 search warrant covers the companies' actions between June 1,  1999, and Oct. 19, 1999. On Oct. 20, 1999, the Pool changed its restatement rules, essentially closing the loophole, though it did so without ever making public its investigation into Powerex and Enron.   Power Pool spokesman Wayne St. Amour declined to discuss details of the investigation.   ""Market surveillance is in place to, among other things, protect the interests and activities of market participants,"" he said.   Those convicted under Canadian law for bid-rigging can be fined an amount at the court's discretion and/or jailed up to five years. A conviction wouldn't likely affect Powerex's ability to trade in the U.S., Peterson said. In Canada ""there would have to have some follow-on action by the Alberta parties to inhibit that. And so far, they still like to get our power.""   Companies Concerned About Reputations   The bigger problem, Peterson said, is what the case will do to the Powerex reputation.   ""Essentially both companies are concerned about it because we have a lot at stake from a reputational point of view,"" Peterson said. ""Both companies, I believe, conduct themselves in the highest possible standard. But these are difficult times in the business with prices going crazy in Alberta and California and people looking for somebody to blame. There's always a possibility of collateral damage when politics gets involved.""   Powerex parent company BC Hydro is also suspected by the Power Pool of Alberta of unfairly providing access to transmission through British Columbia, linking Washington with Alberta, as detailed in an Oct. 13 Power Pool market surveillance report. Again, no charges have been laid.

It was good to see you the other day.   I'm not even sure where you are right now, but I imagine that you are  checking your e-mail, wherever you are.  I was hoping you could give us a  little guidance on tracking down some Indian legal issues -- perhaps a  reference to someone that could assist us.  Clickpaper.com is Enron's electronic  trading marketplace for pulp, paper and  lumber products (including derivative products).  It is modeled after  EnronOnline, but specializes in these commodities.  The team is in the  process of registering customers around the world to access and trade on the  Clickpaper website;  in keeping with the EOL business model, Clickpaper  enters into access and trading agreements with every customer that govern  their use of and trading on the site.  Those access and trading agreements are ""jurisdiction specific"" -- customized  for the particular country in which the customer accessing the site is based  -- in order to deal with jurisdiction-specific legal issues associated with  accessing, or contracting via, the internet, financial trading, regulatory  issues, etc.     The team has identified India as having a large number of potential  customers, and is attending a trade show in New Delhi in early December, and  they would like to be able to sign customers up at that trade show, or at the  very least arrange to give them access to the site.  We therefore need to  consult with legal counsel in India to identify any issues and prepare an  apporpriate access and trading agreement.  EnronOnline has developed a due  diligence checklist which is very helpful in describing our business model  and raising specific legal issues that we are likely to encounter.  Could you refer me to in-house counsel or an outside firm that could assist  us with this project on an expedited basis (isn't that always the case  here)?  I would really appreciate any help you could give to us.  To the other  recipients of this message  -- I know that there are several  people working on this project -- if you already have this project underway,  please let Wade and I know so we aren't duplicating  your efforts.

These change= s=20 are intended to accomplish four key objectives:  First, we need to realign all our wholesale businesses around the successfu= l=20 business model developed over the last decade in North America and Europe. = =20 This model relies on extensive physical and transactional networks built=20 around a relatively small strategic asset position.  Second, we need to significantly streamline corporate reporting=20 relationships.  Particularly with Joe Sutton=01,s departure, the ability to= =20 directly manage the day-to-day activities of 15 independent business units= =20 has become increasingly difficult.  Third, we need to accomplish these changes without, in any way, compromisin= g=20 the ongoing profitability of all our businesses and without delaying or=20 hindering our effort to monetize a significant portion of our lower-yieldin= g=20 asset positions.  And fourth, as always, we need to take advantage of the reorganization to= =20 redeploy our talent into our highest value opportunities.  ENRON WHOLESALE SERVICES  Today, we are forming Enron Wholesale Services (EWS) which will consolidate= =20 our global wholesale businesses.  The closer alignment of our wholesale=20 businesses will accomplish the following: (1) enhanced communication and=20 coordination across business units, (2) more rapid deployment of people to= =20 higher valued opportunities, (3) more effective prioritization of=20 opportunities across the wholesale business, and (4) more rapid extension o= f=20 Enron=01,s wholesale business model and capabilities into new industries an= d=20 markets.  Enron Wholesale Services will include our current North American, European= =20 (including Japan and Australia), Global Markets, and Industrial Markets=20 operations, and will be expanded to include Enron=01,s Net Works business u= nit=20 as well as a new unit =01) Enron Global Assets.  In addition, Enron=01,s me= rchant=20 businesses outside of North America and Europe will be integrated into this= =20 new structure as described below.  Mark Frevert, currently Chairman of each of our wholesale units, will assum= e=20 the role of Chairman and CEO of Enron Wholesale Services.  Greg Whalley,=20 currently Chairman and CEO of Enron Net Works, will join Mark in the Office= =20 of the Chairman as President and Chief Operating Officer.  Providing further impetus for these organizational changes, several of our= =20 international business unit leaders have elected to move into new leadershi= p=20 positions:  Rebecca McDonald, currently CEO of Enron APACHI, will join EWS as President= =20 and CEO of Enron Global Assets. Enron Global Assets will have responsibilit= y=20 for managing all of Enron=01,s existing energy asset portfolio outside of N= orth=20 America and Europe.  Joining Rebecca in the Office of the Chairman as COO= =20 will be Jim Hughes, currently COO of Enron APACHI.  Rebecca and Jim will=20 report to the EWS Office of the Chairman.  Sanjay Bhatnagar, currently CEO of Enron India, has joined EBS as CEO for t= he=20 Middle East and Asia region.  Sanjay will be responsible for building our= =20 broadband business in this region and the current EBS team in this region= =20 will report to Sanjay.  In this role, Sanjay will report to the EBS office = of=20 the Chairman.  In addition, Sanjay will continue to remain responsible for= =20 Enron=01,s wholesale energy business in India and will transition this busi= ness=20 into Enron Global Assets in the near future. =20 Diomedes Christodoulou, currently Co-CEO of Enron South America, has joined= =20 EBS as Chief Commercial Officer.  Diomedes will be located in London and wi= ll=20 focus his origination activities on global opportunities, with near term=20 attention to the wholesale and enterprise sectors.  Diomedes will report to= =20 the EBS Office of the Chairman.  Jim Bannantine, currently Co-CEO of Enron South America, will be joining EE= S=20 to lead EES=01, commercial efforts outside North America and Europe.  In or= der=20 to ensure a smooth transition for our South American businesses and to=20 facilitate our asset sales activities, Jim will remain in South America for= =20 at least the next several months and continue to serve as CEO of Enron Sout= h=20 America.  Throughout the transition, Jim will report to Cliff Baxter and to= =20 the Office of the Chairman of Enron Wholesale Services.  Following the=20 transition, Jim will join EES.  In addition to these changes in our international asset operations=20 activities, we are making the following changes in our merchant wholesale= =20 businesses and the commercial support functions:  Enron Net Works Louise Kitchen will assume Greg=01,s previous responsibilities as President=  and=20 CEO of Enron Net Works, reporting into Mark and Greg. =20  Enron Americas Concurrent with the transfer to Enron Global Assets of responsibility for= =20 operating Enron=01,s South and Central America asset base, all trading,=20 marketing, and new asset development activities in these regions will repor= t=20 into a new entity, Enron Americas.  Enron Americas will have responsibility= =20 for all wholesale merchant businesses across North, Central and South=20 America.  Dave Delainey, President and CEO, and John Lavorato, Chief=20 Operating Officer will comprise the Office of the Chairman for Enron=20 Americas.  Enron Europe The Enron Europe organization, which includes Enron=01,s businesses in Aust= ralia=20 and Japan, and Enron Metals, remains unchanged under the leadership of John= =20 Sherriff, President and CEO, and Michael Brown, Chief Operating Officer.  Enron Global Markets Enron Global Markets, under the leadership of Mike McConnell, President and= =20 CEO, and Jeff Shankman, Chief Operating Officer, will continue to have=20 responsibility for Enron=01,s Middle East and LNG operations.  With the=20 exception of Ecoelectrica in Puerto Rico, all operating power plants and=20 associated personnel in the Caribbean and Central America will transfer to= =20 Enron Global Assets.  Enron Global Markets will also continue to manage the= =20 commodity businesses in crude and products, coal, weather, insurance,=20 equities, interest rates, foreign exchange, and agricultural products.  Enron Industrial Markets Enron Industrial Markets=01, organization, under the leadership of Jeff McM= ahon,=20 President & CEO, and Ray Bowen, Chief Operating Officer, remains unchanged.  Commercial Support for EWS The commercial support functions for EWS will remain with, and be managed b= y,=20 the individual business units.  We are creating no incremental overhead in= =20 the creation of EWS, and in fact hope to reduce our operating costs by more= =20 efficient utilization and sharing of resources across EWS.  To this end we have asked several people to take on an expanded role across= =20 EWS in addition to their ongoing roles within their business units.  These= =20 newly defined roles are as follows:  Mid and Back Office Operations =01) Sally Beck will lead Mid and Back Offic= e=20 Operations across EWS.  These services will become part of Enron Net Works,= =20 with Sally reporting to Louise Kitchen and Rick Causey, Executive Vice=20 President and Chief Accounting Officer.  This alignment creates a coordinat= ed=20 services organization with IT and e-commerce platforms to support the=20 wholesale businesses and to maximize opportunities to commercialize these= =20 services.  Mid and Back Office services for all commercial activities will= =20 continue to be organized with dedicated operations controllers responsible= =20 for specific commodities and/or geographic locations. Legal =01) Mark Haedicke will serve in the role of General Counsel for EWS. Regulatory and Government Affairs =01) This function will remain organized = on a=20 regional basis.  Rick Shapiro will support all EWS businesses operating in= =20 the Americas, and Mark Schroeder, who is based in London, will support all= =20 European and Eastern Hemisphere operations.  Rick and Mark will also contin= ue=20 to support all other Enron businesses operating in their respective regions= =20 and will continue to report to Steve Kean, Executive Vice President and Chi= ef=20 of Staff. Public Relations =01) This function is also organized primarily on a region= al=20 basis.  Eric Thode will have responsibility for North American activity,=20 Enron Net Works, and Enron Industrial Markets.  Jackie Gentle will continue= =20 in her role for Enron Europe (including Japan and Australia) and John Amble= r=20 will have responsibility for activity outside North America and Europe as= =20 well as providing support for Enron Global Markets and Enron Global Assets.=  =20 These individuals will also continue to have a split reporting relationship= =20 to Mark Palmer, Vice President of Communications. Business Analysis and Reporting =01) Wes Colwell will expand his role to co= ver=20 EWS reporting in addition to his current role in North America.  Attached for your review is an organization chart for Enron Wholesale=20 Services which summarizes the changes described here.

ENRON GLOBAL EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION AND ENRON WIND   As part of our company-wide initiative to examine our assets and investmen= ts=20 around the world, we are considering a variety of options with respect to= =20 EGEP and EWC.  As a consequence, we are putting these businesses under Clif= f=20 Baxter=01,s direction.  Jeff Sherrick, CEO of EGEP, and Jim Noles, CEO of E= nron=20 Wind, will report to Cliff.  CORPORATE STAFF   We are consolidating the corporate staff functions: Human Resources,=20 Government Affairs, Public Relations/Communications and Administration.  In= =20 that regard, Cindy Olson, Executive Vice President of Human Resources and= =20 Community Relations, will report to Steve Kean, Executive Vice President an= d=20 Chief of Staff.  COMMITTEE STRUCTURE   In light of the increased leadership opportunities created by Enron=01,s= =20 growth, the Executive Committee will be expanded to include more of our=20 business unit leaders.

No agreements have been reached because there are none that are contemplated. All we have done is to encourage the GOM to approach the GOI for reducing their own liabilities. The details you will find in the other memo I have already sent to you. (I picked up your email after I finished sending my emails).  The approach as u will notice is no different than what we have been following all along and I believe that  you know that already.

Ken had expressed to me last week that you desired to take charge immediately and start moving the resolution of the Dabhol issues forward. I agree that this will be the best way forward. Given the way things are moving, I think that it would be best  that you arrive in Delhi immediately over the weekend so that I can introduce you to the players on Monday and start transitioning the relationships to you and Wade. Wade will join the team in delhi as soon as he is able to travel. Tuesday onwards I have urgent commitments in Mumbai that require my presence there.  As you can appreciate, your presence in these meetings will be essential for you to start getting a feel for the situation on the ground and developing the rapport with the key players. The GOM is clearly driving the train and if we are to assist them its essential that we not slow them down and assist them in any way we can.  regards,  Sanjay     Rebecca McDonald 11/30/2000 01:13 PM  To:   Sanjay Bhatnagar/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT cc:   James A Hughes/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT, Rob       Walls/NA/Enron@Enron, Wade Cline/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT,       Jeff Skilling@ENRON, Kenneth Lay@ENRON Subject:  Meetings with Sharad Pawar  Sanjay,  Through several forwardings of memos it has come to my attention that you had several meetings this week with Sharad Pawar and reached some agreements.  I understand that a conference call to generate a strategy regarding our approach to Mr Pawar was cancelled and no one is able to explain to me what approach  you took or what the nature is of any agreements or accomodations that you may have struck in these meetings.  I think it is important that I and the rest of the task force be involved in the setting of strategy even if we will call on you to conduct any of the discussions and it is clear that it is cooperation and coordination is paramount.  Please call or write immediately with a briefing of those meetings and of any agreements that were agreed to.  In the future, I would appreciate better coordination and discussions on all matter related to Dabhol and to Metgas.  I am available by phone day or night.

Over the last 3 days, I have met with most key players in GOI and GOM assisted by some very close friends of ours. The start of the state assembly session has given some politicians and some vested interests an opportunity to raise issues about Dabhol in the assembly again, a feature that we have seen every year, at about this time, without exception and has led to a number of misleading newspaper reports. The usual suspects are behind the latest stirring of the pot.  The facts however are as follows:  1. GOM (at the administrative and political level) and MSEB remain firmly behind the project and the commitments to it. They are concerned but at the same time looking at proactively working to find a solution. They also believe that they may have found one that is agreeable to GOI.  2. After discussions with us on Tuesday, GOM and MSEB are working on a plan (thru this weekend) to treat Dabhol as a national asset. The plan involves MSEB selling  power from DPC to the central government utility which will then pool the power with over 30,000 MW of power that they currently control and sell the power onward to other states. The plan has already been discussed at senior levels in the GOI and finds general acceptance. Obviously the details are to be worked out and we are proceeding to help GOM put the outline together over this weekend in Delhi and GOM will then discuss it with MOP on Monday.  Wade reported that it was felt that the seniormost GOI ministers be apprised  of the seriousness which with we are viewing this situation. This was already done Tuesday.  3. The Indian Lenders to the Dabhol project have met and agreed to a 30 day waiver of MSEB delay in payment - agreed subject to review of the situation at the end of 6 months. They have also agreed to the Equity transfer - subject to lenders counsel confirming that there are no legal issues under any of the project contracts. This shows the lender support for continuing to move forward and buys us time to put in place the fix we are planning.  4. Ministry of Power has yesterday agreed to support an effort to freeze the duties on imported fuel at a lower level of about $12/bbl versus the current $35 or so. This will help achieve an immediate reduction in tariff from Phase I and make Dabhol more competitive. This proposal is currently with Ministry of Finance and our expectation is that they will review it favorably as the MOP is taking it up personally.  All signs that I have received in India over the last few days lead me to believe that the GOM is committed to solving the Dabhol issues at the earliest. While we all have concerns, they seem to be addressable and if the current plan is successful, they can  be sorted out within the context of current and existing documentation.  I have left names out but they are better discussed on the call that has been scheduled for Monday evening India time. Hope that this helps in the meantime.

I was hoping you could give us a  little guidance on tracking down some Indian legal issues -- perhaps a  reference to someone that could assist us.  Clickpaper.com is Enron's electronic  trading marketplace for pulp, paper and  lumber products (including derivative products).  It is modeled after  EnronOnline, but specializes in these commodities.  The team is in the  process of registering customers around the world to access and trade on the  Clickpaper website;  in keeping with the EOL business model, Clickpaper  enters into access and trading agreements with every customer that govern  their use of and trading on the site.  Those access and trading agreements are ""jurisdiction specific"" -- customized  for the particular country in which the customer accessing the site is based  -- in order to deal with jurisdiction-specific legal issues associated with  accessing, or contracting via, the internet, financial trading, regulatory  issues, etc.     The team has identified India as having a large number of potential  customers, and is attending a trade show in New Delhi in early December, and  they would like to be able to sign customers up at that trade show, or at the  very least arrange to give them access to the site.  We therefore need to  consult with legal counsel in India to identify any issues and prepare an  apporpriate access and trading agreement.  EnronOnline has developed a due  diligence checklist which is very helpful in describing our business model  and raising specific legal issues that we are likely to encounter.  Could you refer me to in-house counsel or an outside firm that could assist  us with this project on an expedited basis (isn't that always the case  here)?

Vittorio Mincato, Eni's chief executive, confirmed that the group is on the verge of finalizing the sale of its Immobiliare Metanopoli property subsidiary (Eni's real estate company) with assets valued between $856 million and $1.3 billion. Eni's decision to divest its property assets has been viewed by many observers of the company as an attempt to release funds to facilitate a merger with another company. Enron Corp. has been among those on a rumored short list of merger prospects for Eni.  ANALYSIS: Is the foundation being established for a mega-merger between Eni and Enron? It is not too difficult to formulate a theoretical argument in that direction.  Eni is Italy's state-owned, multi-faceted energy company, operating in the oil and gas, power generation, petrochemicals, oilfield services, and engineering industries. The company has a market capitalization of about 47 billion euros (approximately $40 billion), is present in over 70 countries and produces more than one million barrels of oil equivalent a day. Across the European energy market-which once it has fully privatized will represent  an arguably larger market than the United States-Eni is unquestionably one of the Continent's leading champions.  Illustrating this point, Eni has taken several important steps within Europe  to, as it says, ""play an increasingly important role"" in the Continent's competitive energy market. For instance, earlier this month, Eni inked a deal to sell 2 billion cubic meters of natural gas to Gaz de France. This deal followed a previous agreement in which Eni agreed to sell 4 billion cubic meters of natural gas to Italy's largest private energy supplier, Edison. With both agreements, Eni has given a substantial kick start to the opening of the European natural-gas market. CEO Mincato has said that Eni would recoup the losses made by giving up its market hold in Italy by ""focusing on international markets.""  One move that Eni has made outside of Europe also came earlier this month. Eni made a bid for Australia's Petroz NL, which wields an 8.25 percent stake in Bayu-Undan, the giant gas and liquids project located off the northern coast of Australia. Eni already owns 6.7 percent of Bayu-Undan and apparently is attempting to gain a majority ownership over the project. It is no wonder why-the Bayu-Undan field has recoverable reserves of 400 million barrels of liquefied petroleum gas and gas reserves of 3.4 trillion cubic feet. Petroz has not yet accepted Eni's offer, but a favorable decision is expected shortly. Thus, whatever Eni may be divesting in Italy it is trying to regain in other key areas of the world. In fact, Mincato recently confirmed that Eni plans to increase its daily output of oil from a current level of 1.2 million barrels to 1.5 million barrels by 2003.  Moreover, Eni has been making aggressive attempts at expansion, both within Europe and beyond. Along with that expansion comes the development of merger  strategy. Eni does not want to be left as a target for a takeover, which could be a strong possibility given its recent divestitures and the fact that its profits remain strong. Net income for the company for the first half of 2000 was 2,606 millions of euros (equivalent to approximately $2.2 billion), representing a 119-percent increase. Eni is largely considered one of the best buys among the big oil stocks, but it would rather merge with an equal partner than be sold to another company. As consolidation of the oil industry continues, Eni reportedly believes that the only way to remain a top player is to marry an equally large player on the world stage.  Enron may be at the top of Eni's list of merger partners. Negotiations with Spain's largest oil company, Repsol, appear to have stalled, as was confirmed when Mincato stated that any ""link-up with Repsol would not be a merger of equals."" French oil company TotalFina is also interested, but is preoccupied with its own acquisition of fellow French oil company Elf. Other companies that have been mentioned include Conoco and Phillips Petroleum. It is quite obvious that Eni's merger prospects are predominantly oil companies, which is quite clearly the company's intention. Thus, it may seem odd that Enron is also included as a top prospect. Enron, while unquestionably a world player, is known for its unorthodox approach to hard assets. Put succinctly, Enron believes that it doesn't need to own physical assets in order to be a major player, but rather it only needs to rely on strategic  contractual agreements.  However, if Eni wants to continue to expand globally, it arguably could not find a better partner than Enron, generally considered North America's biggest buyer and seller of electricity and natural gas. Enron's gas trading  and distribution activities in particular-along with its electricity production, raw material trading and broadband expansion-would all appear to be good compliments to Eni's portfolio. Reports of talks between the two companies first appeared in the Italian financial paper iL Sole 24 Ore, based on input from an unnamed source. The report indicated that Enron is being targeted by Eni for an equity partnership or even a full merger. Mincato, as recently as Tuesday of this week, continues to adamantly deny that any deal with Enron is being studied.  Not surprisingly, Enron is remaining mum on the rumors and has not even mentioned Eni in any recent disclosures. However, the incorporation of Eni's power production portfolio would support Enron's expansion into new markets such as Japan, for example. Back in March, the Japanese government began allowing non-utility firms to supply power to industrial and commercial end-users. Almost simultaneously, Enron established a new subsidiary, Enron Japan Corp., to capitalize on new opportunities in the country. Enron Japan's first offer is a 10-percent discount off current electricity prices for customers who sign on with Enron for two to four years. Operating against its North American strategy, Enron also plans to build a power station in northern Japan, beating to the punch several of its key rivals, including  Vivendi, Texaco and Royal Dutch Shell, which also have expressed interest in establishing operations in the country.  Enron's proposed power plant should give the company prime access to companies in the Tohoku and Kanto regions, as well as Tokyo, the ""big catch"" of the Japanese market. In my opinion, herein lies the primary synergy that would make the partnership between Eni and Enron a strategic step for both companies. As Eni attempts to position itself in various key markets, Japan seems like a natural location, and I've seen no reports that indicate Eni is moving into Japan on its own. The fact that Enron is already there, along with most other lucrative international markets, must certainly be appealing  to Eni. Regarding Enron's perspective on any potential partnering, Eni's substantial oil and natural-gas generation assets, along with its current lock on the European market, must be very attractive.  Enron's current market capitalization is about $48 billion, which actually makes it larger than Eni. This raises the question of which company would be the buying partner if a merger were to indeed take place. All of the rumors flying around currently speak of Eni pursuing Enron, but it could just as easily be the other way around. Those of us who follow Enron closely  may find it hard to believe that the powerhouse company would ever be the target for a takeover or even a merger. In any case, the rumors continue to fly as Eni responds to claims of ""thou doth protest too much."" Whether or not any such merger between Eni and Enron, which appears smart on paper, will materialize remains to be seen. However, it certainly seems like Eni is lining up its chess pieces to cement some kind of partnership in the very near future. ============================================================== SCIENTECH can help you find the answers you need.

Vittorio Mincato, Eni's chief executive, confirmed that the group is on the verge of finalizing the sale of its Immobiliare Metanopoli property subsidiary (Eni's real estate company) with assets valued between $856 million and $1.3 billion. Eni's decision to divest its property assets has been viewed by many observers of the company as an attempt to release funds to facilitate a merger with another company. Enron Corp. has been among those on a rumored short list of merger prospects for Eni.  ANALYSIS: Is the foundation being established for a mega-merger between Eni and Enron? It is not too difficult to formulate a theoretical argument in that direction.  Eni is Italy's state-owned, multi-faceted energy company, operating in the oil and gas, power generation, petrochemicals, oilfield services, and engineering industries. The company has a market capitalization of about 47 billion euros (approximately $40 billion), is present in over 70 countries and produces more than one million barrels of oil equivalent a day. Across the European energy market-which once it has fully privatized will represent  an arguably larger market than the United States-Eni is unquestionably one of the Continent's leading champions.  Illustrating this point, Eni has taken several important steps within Europe  to, as it says, ""play an increasingly important role"" in the Continent's competitive energy market. For instance, earlier this month, Eni inked a deal to sell 2 billion cubic meters of natural gas to Gaz de France. This deal followed a previous agreement in which Eni agreed to sell 4 billion cubic meters of natural gas to Italy's largest private energy supplier, Edison. With both agreements, Eni has given a substantial kick start to the opening of the European natural-gas market. CEO Mincato has said that Eni would recoup the losses made by giving up its market hold in Italy by ""focusing on international markets.""  One move that Eni has made outside of Europe also came earlier this month. Eni made a bid for Australia's Petroz NL, which wields an 8.25 percent stake in Bayu-Undan, the giant gas and liquids project located off the northern coast of Australia. Eni already owns 6.7 percent of Bayu-Undan and apparently is attempting to gain a majority ownership over the project. It is no wonder why-the Bayu-Undan field has recoverable reserves of 400 million barrels of liquefied petroleum gas and gas reserves of 3.4 trillion cubic feet. Petroz has not yet accepted Eni's offer, but a favorable decision is expected shortly. Thus, whatever Eni may be divesting in Italy it is trying to regain in other key areas of the world.

I have discussed this with both Randy and  Rob and they support this move.    Celina is a Brazilian-qualified lawyer with a U.S. LLM who was hired a year  ago as a paralegal rather than as an attorney due to her relative lack of law  firm experience.  During the past year she has been enthusiastic in pursuing  her professional development and demonstrating her capabilites as a  professional.  She has actively sought out opportunities to take on more  responsibility and to learn more about our business and has worked very hard  to win the confidence of the lawyers and clients with whom she works.  We  believe that she has demonstrated the ability to operate at the junior  attorney level now and the potential to develop into a solid senior Enron  attorney in the future.  As a junior attorney, she would continue to work  under the supervision of more senior attorneys and would have the opportunity  to continue her professional development.    I understand that we have done this elsewhere in the Company and believe that  it sends the right message to others in the department that there are  opportunities for advancement and that hard work and merit are rewarded.  Please let me know how you feel about this recommendation and whether you  think it would be appropriate for us to schedule her to visit with you in  Houston.  Thanks.

Robert C Williams@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT 12/06/2000 02:20 PM To: Rob Walls, James Derrick/Corp/Enron@ENRON cc:    Subject: Potential Lawsuit Versus Copel, Petrobras, Compagas, and Compagas  Board Members  Privileged and Confidential Attorney-Client Communication;  Attorney Work  Product  We may need to file a suit this week or next to enjoin the signing of a gas  supply agreement between Petrobras and Compagas.  As you know, Enron  (Dutapar), Copel, and Petrobras are the three shareholders of Compagas.   Copel has as interest (along with El Paso) in the power plant which would use  the gas.  A contract has already been signed between Compagas and the plant.   The Compagas Board votes on the agreement tomorrow.  The gas supply contract  would have a 20-year term and would be worth $1.2 billion.  The ground for  the suit would be that, under Brazilian law, Compagas is required to solicit  bids for the gas supply arrangement.   Compagas has sought to justify not  soliciting bids on the basis that Petrobras is the only supplier capable of  supplying the gas.  This is incorrect:  Enron, among others, is also capable  of supplying the gas.  We have a legal opinion supporting our position. and  have called for a special shareholders' meeting to discuss the issue.  We  anticipate that Petrobras and Copel, despite their obvious conflict of  interest, will force the issue and will vote in favor of the agreement  nonetheless.   Tozzini Freire has been advising us, and is doing an excellent job.  If you  approve, we would like to continue to use them if litigation is necessary.

Although clearly slanted, the following is rather astute local coverage  of the issue. John    12/06/2000 The Hindu Copyright (C) 2000 Kasturi & Sons Ltd (KSL); Source: World Reporter (TM) -  Asia Intelligence Wire   MUMBAI, DEC. 5. Strange as it may sound, the Maharashtra State Electricity  Board (MSEB) would be paying less for the energy it buys from the  Enron-sponsored Dabhol Power Company if it buys more. If it buys only half of  the present capacity, the state- owned power utility would pay, as it  does now, around Rs. 95 crores per month towards unbought power. That is its  entrapment signed and sealed with Enron.   Under the contract between the MSEB and the Dabhol- based independent power  producer, the pricing of its output has two components: capacity  charges and the variable or fuel charge. If it buys power, it pays a  combination of the two and if it does not, MSEB has to fork out the capacity  charges  which is almost a penalty for not picking up the energy.   At present, MSEB is allowed to buy only 3,044 million units which is about  half the Dabhol plant's capacity during its currently operating Phase I  because  the Electricity Regulatory Commission has stipulated that only cheaply  sourced power should be on its shopping list and if it has to draw from  Dabhol, then  the ceiling is 3,044 million units.   That means, when the MSEB pays for half the power that would be available, it  is also paying some Rs. 95 crores towards the capacity charges and which is  loaded on what has been bought. This arithmetic has pushed the price, in  addition to the weakened rupee against the US dollar plus the $30 per barrel  of oil in  the international market, to hover at close to Rs. 7 per unit.   Arguably, it would have been cheaper to buy the entire output from the  present Phase I capacity of 740 mw but the problem is that MSEB does not have  money  to pay for that. Therefore it would like to evaluate its options, as advised  by the Maharashtra Government, so that the right ways and means could be  found to  handle this issue.   One is to appeal to the MERC to allow all the power to be bought as it is  produced, since the IPP is all set to activate a part of its Phase II  capacity which is pegged  at 1,444 MW and then get energy at a lower average price. That means it can  avoid paying the capacity charges it can ill-afford. Says an official : ""it  is throwing  good money behind the bad.""   Let us look at the prices paid hitherto, when the US currency had a different  parity with the rupee. When it was Rs. 43.02 to a dollar, the MSEB was billed  at Rs. 3.37  per unit in May 1999. Then it was tossed upwards, to reach Rs. 6.81 now and  next month, move to about Rs. 6.90 per unit. ""If the rupee slides further, we  pay more,""  an official explained.   There is a nice little twist to the Enron story. If the Power Purchase  Agreement, as re-negotiated by the Shiv Sena - BJP Government had not made  the 1,444 mw  Phase II mandatory as against only an option to either pick up or reject in  the earlier PPA, this need a re-look at the Phase II or the entire project  may not have arisen.   Those in the know of the economics of the situation explain :""If it was an  option, we could have taken a hard look at the experience with the Phase I  and decided on  our steps. But the millstone was tied around the MSEB neck in 1996 itself by  the previous Government. There seems to be no escape route except to ask the  IPP to  lower its prices by managing its cost of funds."" That is now being done. Some  FIs like IDBI have offered to lower its interest rate provided the lowered  burden is  transferred to the MSEB in the tariff. This is yet to become a widespread  offer from FIs but the MSEB may, with the Maharashtra Government's help,  quietly lobby  towards that objective. That would not mean a lot but in the payouts, a few  paise per unit less.   When the first block of Phase II is activated by June 2001, at present  dollar-rupee parity, with the price of petroleum products being the same, the  price of power  from Dabhol is estimated at about Rs. 5.43 per unit but that too to a  financially crippled power board is stiff. But it can do little because of  the ""take or pay"" deal  with Enron.   If the petroleum prices remain steady and the rupee does not slide, and when  the second block of Phase II is operational, the price of power could dip but  ""we  are talking of a situation which we can guess at."" This is on the basis that  MSEB can buy all the power and not merely end up paying capacity charges for  not  buying energy.   According to present estimates, outgo towards power bought and not bought,  would be Rs. 511 crores per month June 2001 onward, Rs. 712 crores per month  October 2001 onward when the current realisation for the MSEB is only Rs. 920  crores per month from all power sold from all sources it accesses, its own  and  others. That is unlikely to go up substantially, not in the near future.     Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.

Sandeep Katwala led a group reviewing our permits  and approvals.  They feel pretty good about our compliance with these  permits/approvals.  As you have heard on previous phone calls, the day tank  seepage some time ago makes us the most nervous.  It seems to us that a  release from the site resulting in substantial groundwater contamination  plays pretty well in the court of public opinion given DPC's failure to ""come  forward"" on the issue (even though it was advised at the time of the release  that it had no legal obligation to do so).  Sandeep's note is below.  PPA Review.  Paul Kraske led a group reviewing the PPA.  His memo on this  issue is also below.  He feels pretty good about our ongoing compliance with  the PPA.  The instances of the non-compliance are not particularly material  and none would appear to play well in the court of public opinion.  I should  also note that it would be very difficult for MSEB to lawfully terminate the  PPA -- that remedy is not readily available to MSEB under the PPA terms.  Both review efforts have relied somewhat on the representations of DPC  personnel.  The India legal team was able to ""tie down"" many significant  issues with written documentation but in many cases have relied on the oral  representations of our own employees to confirm compliance with our  obligations.  There are a number of other legal review efforts underway and I will keep you  apprised as these reviews progress.

Based on discussions with DPC personnel and a review of  correspondence where relevant, no material non-compliance issues have  surfaced which I feel would pose a problem under the PPA. There are two  instances under the Reserve Bank of India approvals DPC has failed to submit  reports to the Ministry of Finance within the time frame indicated; these are  however minor issues. We have to accept that there may be practical instances  where there may not be strict compliance at the site (eg the actual  construction of physical assets is not strictly as per the layout approved by  the authorities) but, from the discussions with DPC personnel none of these  have come to light. On the environment approvals DPC has submitted compliance  statements to the Maharashtra State Pollution Control Board which confirm  that DPC is in compliance with the conditions in the relevant approvals. We  have relied on these statements as being accurate.   With respect to the water pollution issue, as we saw on Saturday, DPC has  notified MPCB pursuant to the show cause notice of the measures taken to  mitigate the pollution off the site. That correspondence seemed to indicate  that there should be no further problems with this issue. However, my sense  is that we have not seen the end of this issue and in particular, the report  currently being prepared by GSDA has not yet surfaced in final form. There is  no guarantee that it will be positive. Shobhan's view that it is difficult to  see how a Court would support an injunction of some sort shutting down the  plant ""permanently"" given the remedial measures taken by DPC is persuasive -  you can however see that it provides excellent ammunition for PR purposes.

Enron's shareholder    representative was also involved.  The parties reached agreement in    principle on the open issues (the owner dropped its claims against EECC,    EECC relinquished two smaller claims, the Owner will pay EECC's    remaining claims).  Bracewell's analysis of the claims was very helpful    in reaching this result.    Marmara: As expected, Black&Veatch has filed a formal notice of    arbitration against EECC relative to sums they claim are due them with    respect to the Marmara Project. EECC management expects that this will    be settled early next year, and that it may provide an opportunity to    reach a global settlement with Black & Veatch re Puerto Rico and    potential future work.  Gail Brownfeld and Scott Burdine of Hagans, Bob,    Burdine are both up to speed.    Dabhol: Besix has informed us that we will be receiving thier notice of    arbitration re the Dabhol Quarry before the end of the year. We are told    that they have changed their counsel, apparently releasing the English    firm of Masons and engaging a firm in Washington DC of Watts, Tieder,    Hoffer & Fitzgerald to carry the claim forward. This is an unusual move,    since the contract is governed by English law and the site of the    arbitration will London. Besix's local representative told  our project    manager that Besix was not happy with the Masons advice, but it may be    that they want a US firm involved, backed up by an English firm. I have    asked Phil Bruns to check into the reputation of  Watts, Teider. He was    not familiar with them, but has found that it is a 67 lawyer firm that    specializes in construction and real with a main office in northern    Virginia and offices in California. Gail Brownfeld, Phil Bruns, and    Jonathon Rosshandler are all aware of this development.

In late July, I contacted Chris Hilen with LaBeouf's San Francisco office to  ask if he would represent us in the Order Instituting Investigation which  arose from the summer's price spikes in San Diego.  He said he would check  with Reliant to ensure there were no conflicts.  When he returned my call,  Reliant was unwilling to permit LaBeouf to proceed on our behalf.  Because I  had been told earlier this year that Reliant would probably never be opposed  to  us anywhere but Texas in the future, I called a contact at Reliant who  referred me to Mike Jines in the general counsel's office.  Mr. Jines was  unavailable, so I left him a voicemail message.  I told him that as I  understood it, Reliant is only in the generation business in CA and not in  the retail sales of electricity as we are.  We should both be interested in  options that create better markets, lift rate caps and foment competition.   Consequently, I felt there was no conflict here.  It took Mr. Jines some days  to respond.  The intervention date was quickly approaching and needed legal  assistance, I turned to Arter Hadden.  Some time after we had made that  commitment (and after the intervention date), Mr. Jines called and suggested  that perhaps something could be worked out.  Due to the press of other  business, I did not return the call as the immediate situation had been  resolved.  In October then, as we searched for a lobby firm in Sacramento, one person  who was highly recommended told us Reliant would be ""extremely uncomfortable""  if she were to represent us, too.  She opted not to interview with us.  Since  the message was similar to the original message to LaBeouf, I have moved on  to find another lobbyist and have not followed up with Jines.

In essence, the suits claim that the AOL 5.0 software makes it impossible to get access to another ISP, once the software is installed with AOL chosen as the default ISP. Also, the plaintiffs claim, AOL knew from its beta testers that these and other problems existed, but that the online giant refused to fix the software before releasing it. . . .

" The very first time that I laid eyes on  Steve Susman , he was clad only in  his underwear.  Moreover, he was  shouting  and angrily brandishing his fist  at me!  The Northern Lights may have seen stranger sights, but I assure you I  have not.   In 1968 or 1969 (you will understand that I have repressed the actual date),  I journeyed to Fort Worth, Texas as a representative of the Texas Law Review  to attend some State Bar of Texas committee meeting, one being held, I think,  in conjunction with an annual meeting of the Bar.  The Law Review had  reserved a few rooms at one of the downtown hotels.  I arrived late at  night,  dutifully registered at the hotel's desk, received my room  key,   took the elevator to the designated floor, walked to my room, inserted the  room key, and opened the door.  The darkness that shrouded the room was  suddenly pierced by a flare of light that revealed to my astonished eyes a  bear of a man, almost naked, leaping out of the bed toward me, shaking a very  large fist in the vicinity of my face, and demanding to know why I had  violated the sanctity of his room!     It will surprise none who know Steve to learn that although he was   adamantly insisting  on an explanation, he refused to be quiet long enough  for me to offer him one.  Knowing even at my then tender young age a madman  when I see one, I exited  the scene of the controversy with as much speed as  my terrified legs could muster and rushed back to the front desk with my tale  of adventure and close escape from severe bodily injury.  There may well have  been some talk of calling hotel security or the Fort Worth Police, but in the  end I settled for a new room, the door of which I bolted immediately.    After a mostly sleepless night during which I anticipated the imminent  reappearance of the madman, I arose, showered,  dressed, and carefully made  my way to the meeting room.  During the course of the day, I spotted the  madman across the ballroom engaged in conversation with another individual.   Surreptitiously pointing him out to one of my friends, I asked if he knew  him.  The answer was no, but he did know who he was.  ""The name is Susman, my  man, Steve Susman"".  I immediately resolved that my path and that of   ""Susman, my man, Steve Susman"" would never again cross.     Truth is indeed stranger than fiction.  How could I have possibly foreseen  as I fled from the madman in  that Forth Worth hotel room so many years ago  that not only would my path again cross his but that I would one day serve as  his lawyer, that  he  would serve as mine,  and that I would count him  as  one of my closest friends!  I hereby officially  forgive you, Steve, not only  for stealing my  Fort Worth hotel room but also  for the injury you wished on  me that night.  Looking back on it, I wouldn't want it to have been  any  other way.   I wish you the Happiest of Birthdays, Steve.  Thanks for your friendship--I  treasure it.    All the best,    Jim       ",rwright@wt.net,james.derrick@enron.com,Steve Susman,2001-01-11 07:50:00-08:00,sent

Accordingly, the Court found that the trial court erred by refusing to give a ""motivating factor"" instruction in this pretext case.  Prior federal court decisions addressing Title VII ""pretext"" cases had required a plaintiff to demonstrate that the protected characteristic was a ""determining factor"" in the decision at issue. These federal cases indicated that the ""motivating factor"" standard was applicable only to ""mixed motive cases"" in which the plaintiff had direct evidence of discrimination.  Also troubling for Texas employers is the Court's secondary holding regarding the plaintiff's evidence of age discrimination.  The company terminated the plaintiff's employment for documented poor performance. Because the plaintiff offered anecdotal evidence from co-workers suggesting that he was a good performer, the court determined that he had produced sufficient evidence of pretext to get to the jury, citing Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Prods. Inc., 120 S.Ct. 2097 (2000).  As suggested by the dissenting judges, this holding could mean that a plaintiff can avoid summary judgment in a poor performance case by producing some evidence of positive performance feedback  For a detailed summary of the decision, please see http://www.velaw.com/pubs/labor/laboralert03-01b.htm ___________________________________________________________  If you have any problems receiving the Labor & Employment e-LERT via e-mail or have any comments, please direct such to Candace Pinnell at mailto:cpinnell@velaw.com.

Due to the May 1st date falling in the final days of the legislative session, my efforts to get one of our key legislators to speak in Houston on that day have been unavailing (all would be anxious to do so at some later date).  Consequently, I have tentatively arranged for Malcolm K. Brenner to join us that day.  Dr. Brenner is a Professor in the  Department of Pediatrics and Medicine, Section of Hematology-Oncology, at Baylor College of Medicine.  Among other duties at the Center for Cell and Gene Therapy at Baylor, Texas Children's Hospital and The Methodist Hospital, Dr. Brenner is the Director of the Shell Center for Gene Therapy at Baylor.  My thought was that you might find it interesting to hear what Dr. Brenner has to say about where we  are and where we are going in the field of gene therapy.  He recently made a similar presentation to our Board of Trustees, and it was very well received.  If anyone thinks it undesirable to depart from past practice in this way, please say so.  Further, I will be happy to have anyone else that you may suggest join us on May 1st in Dr. Brenner's stead.

Jim   -----Original Message----- From:  Williamson, Joannie   Sent: Wednesday, March 21, 2001 7:24 AM To: Derrick Jr., James Subject: URGENT RESPONSE REQUIRED  Thought you should see this.

Dear Friend,  I am Dr Rasheed Mohammed, the newly appointed head of the Foreign Remittance Department in the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN). I got your contact from a business directory of your country and based on your business activities and the type of investment I have in mind, I found you to be the most suitable person for the transaction stated below.   Before I proceed, I want to strongly advice that you devoid yourself from the general conception you have about Nigerians. I would like you to carefully study this proposal without bias, since it would be relevant in our lives.  It is a usual practice in Nigeria for ministers and high-ranking government officials to divert government's money into their private accounts; this is usually done through CBN with the connivance of senior officials. The ministers and military generals especially during the era of late general sani Abacha, achieve this by diverting most of the funds, meant for the development of their respective agencies and ministries into the CBN escrow accounts. Usually it is this same escrow account that holds funds for the payment of foreign contracts.  With the help of the inside officials, the minister or senior government officials and military generals would now create themselves or employ the assistance of a foreign partner to create them as artificial contractors, using fiticious documents to remit the deposited money to the nominated bank account of their foreign partners. In this case the money is treated as payment for foreign contract, and there is no trace. This is how federal government's money is siphoned on a regular basis, to the extent that most people now result to letter scams and fraud due to the knowledge they have about it.  Due to the impromptu removal of my successor from the central bank, he did not have enough time to perfect and tidy up the transactions they have in place. So the funds are now trapped at the central bank escrow account with no records. I just discovered this in a bid to fulfill my obligation to submit the state of our escrow account to the federal government and the governor of CBN before I commence any foreign payment. I am conducting a sort of reconciliation of our escrow account to declare to the government the total amount that have been spent in the last three years and what it was spent for. So,  in the course of carrying out the above exercise, I discovered a total sum of $150MILLION in the escrow account that is unknown to anyone and with no records. My intention is to reveal about USD $100M to the federal government so that I can be in his good books and make arrangement to transfer the outstanding USD $50M into a safe account abroad. It is based on this that I am making this urgent contact with you.   However, I am doing this because of the nature of my job. I am a civil servant that is poorly paid and more so, there is no way I can remain in this office forever. I have children to cater for even when I retire as the director, which is just next year. So, I need something tangible to fall back on when I retire. Besides, if I declare the total funds to the government, it would probably go into the pockets of a few people that control the government. This is to enlighten you on the degree of corruption in Nigeria. So, do not blame me for my action because you would do the same if you were in my shoes, knowing fully well that there will be no compensation even if you disclose everything to the government.  Well, I have discovered that I can transfer this money if we could quickly create you as an artificial contractor, by using your company document and Bank account to receive the money, in the same way my successor transferred theirs. The only difference is that the final payment is going to be made to your named company through any of our correspondent payment center in Europe or America, due to the policies adopted by the new democratic government.  The entire process is not easy, but it is achievable due to my position in the foreign remittance department of the CBN, and the relationship I have with the present director of external payment and finance of the federal ministry of finance.  The entire operation will be between the three of us: (I) I shall take care of all documentation, (ii) My friend in the federal ministry of finance will take care of all lobbying and use of influence to get all documentation, (iii) You shall take care of the banking arrangements, provide the needed invoices to enable us apply for claims and approvals and travel as the beneficiary to receive the funds from the payment center you shall be paid from.  After we have succeeded in transferring this funds, 20% shall be retained by you for your assistance, 5% for the settlement of all debts we might incur in the course of this transaction and the remaining 75% shall be for me and my colleague, which we would possibly invest in into your company or any viable business venture you suggest.  If you are comfortable with this programme please revert to me at once via telephone number 234-1-7593507 or fax number 234-1-7590440. Should your response be positive, I would then instruct on the next step to take.  Due to security reasons, when you call, do not ask for any name, simply ask me to reconfirm the telephone number. Once I reconfirm my number to be 234-1-7593507, you can then mention my name before you go into any discussion. If I fail to reply correctly, do not wait for a second trial, just drop the phone and call back later.  We demand a quick response from you. Any delay might result in contacting someone else. Irrespective of what happens, we count on your maturity to keep the transaction to yourself. So, you are advised to treat this transaction with utmost confidentiality.  Looking forward to your urgent response.  Yours faithfully,  Dr Rasheed Mohammed    __________________________________________________ Do You Yahoo!? Get email at your own domain with Yahoo!

We have gone from fire to fire.  Over the last 24 hours (since    we submitted our last hurry up brief) I have been reflecting on the    experience.  To say it has been positive is an understatement.     Under ordinary circumstances working under such continual pressure--with    so much $ on the line--would have been stressful.  However, when you    work with Enron the opposite is true.  There is such a sense of esprit    d' corp that permeates your organization.  It makes difficult things    easy and the impossible, just another day in the office.     There are no egos to trip over at Enron.  When there is a problem to    solve, it is everyone's problem.  People are not afraid of asking    questions.  They keep questioning until they understand.  Nobody minds    repeating themselves.  They are incredibly patient with outside    lawyers--spending hours and hours bringing us up to speed.  As you well    know, yours is not a simple business.  It is so refreshing.     There are so many benefits to this team approach.     1.  You get things right the first time.  As you know, in any litigation    is critical that the court view your side as the teller of truth.    Because you get things right the first time,  the company is not exposed    to being discredited when the other side responds.     2.  I would bet that Enron's outside legal bills are half what they    would be otherwise.  With most companies the outside (and inside)    lawyers get a minimum of support from the business people.  The business    people view business as business and lawsuits as an annoyance.  (I    should say that I could never understand that given the direct  Perhaps    it is the trader mentality at the company.  Perhaps it is an unwavering    focus on the bottom line.  Perhaps it is just that everyone feels they    are a part of a team and they realize that by working together the team    can achieve things that no one person can do working alone.  Whatever    the reason, the outside lawyer's job is made so much easier.  That    results in much, much lower legal bills.     3. You increase your chances of winning.  The brainstorming is so    valuable.     4. The outside lawyers, like me, feel they are part of the team.    Outside lawyers do not feel as if they are on trial.  They can ask the    dumb questions.  I know that all of us here are looking forward to the    next opportunity to work with the Enron team.     5.  Human nature being what it is--I think that when there are choices    to be made as to whose work goes on the top of the pile--the Enron    assignment goes to the top more often than not.     You have built a great legal team.  All of your legal staff should be    proud of what they have built.      Thanks for letting us come along for the ride.     Regards,     Bill     A.

We have gone from fire to fire.  Over the last 24 hours    (since       we submitted our last hurry up brief) I have been reflecting on the       experience.  To say it has been positive is an understatement.        Under ordinary circumstances working under such continual    pressure--with       so much $ on the line--would have been stressful.  However, when you       work with Enron the opposite is true.  There is such a sense of    esprit       d' corp that permeates your organization.  It makes difficult things       easy and the impossible, just another day in the office.        There are no egos to trip over at Enron.  When there is a problem to       solve, it is everyone's problem.  People are not afraid of asking       questions.  They keep questioning until they understand.  Nobody    minds       repeating themselves.  They are incredibly patient with outside       lawyers--spending hours and hours bringing us up to speed.  As you    well       know, yours is not a simple business.  It is so refreshing.        There are so many benefits to this team approach.        1.  You get things right the first time.

" As I indicated in my earlier phone-mail message, Elektro would like  authorization to bring two suits in Rio de Janeiro against ANEEL (the  Brazilian regulatory agency) and Furnas (a federal company acting as agent  for power sales from Itaipu).  These suits would be based on these entities'  failure to allow Elektro to pass through certain increases in the cost of  electricity to its customers.  Despite lengthy negotiations, the parties have  been unable to resolve their differences and it appears that a court  challenge is the only way forward.  As I mentioned (long-windedly) in my phone mail, the first suit would relate  to an 8% increase in the price of electricity which Elektro has been  prevented, due to the procedural wrangling and subterfuge of ANEEL, from  immediately passing on to its customers.  By way of background, Elektro must  buy in excess of 4% of the electricity produced by Itaipu.  ANEEL has  authorized Furnas to increase the cost of Itaipu's electricity by  approximately 8%.  Elektro believes that, pursuant to its concession  contract, it should be able to immediately pass this extraordinary increase  along to its customers.  Instead of allowing this pass-through, ANEEL has  required Elektro to wait for the date of its annual rate adjustment to  receive the increase.  In the meantime, Elektro is required to absorb the 8%  increase with no retroactive adjustment available allowing it to recoup the  increase. It is my understanding that during the months before the rate  increase is authorized, Elektro loses approximately $80,000 per month.   Accordingly, Electro would like to file suit to obtain declaratory relief:  (i) supporting the immediate pass-through of any rate increase, and (ii)  injunctive relief to prevent imposition of sanctions and/or interest.    The second suit contemplated by Elektro would involve not just the 8%  increase mentioned above but also would involve other increases that Elektro  has had to bear without the benefit of an immediate pass-through to its  customers. Since 1999, in disregard of both the parties' agreement and the  law, Elektro has been denied immediate pass-throughs for a number of  increases in the cost of electricity, related taxes and other legal  encumbrances.  According to Elektro's calculations, the amount in dispute in  this ""bigger picture"" litigation is approximately $42 million.    Mr. Bermudes' firm believe that the chances of winning both suits are very  high and, on the ""bigger picture"" suit has already provided this opinion in  writing.  Other than the possible negative impact on Elektro's relationship  with ANEEL and the length of time the court in Rio could take to decide the  matter (5-6 years) the downside to initiating the litigation does not seem  great.  According to Elektro, these suits would not jeopardize Elektro's  agreement to sell electricity and would result in nominal interest and  penalty should they prove unsuccessful.   Please let me know if Elektro is authorized to proceed as set forth above.

"Richard, I would like to meet with you re these claims and the others referred to in the message below to insure that we have all necessary information regarding them and have the appropriate legal counsel attending to them.  Thank you. Jim   -----Original Message----- From:  Paul Johnson, T   Sent: Monday, March 26, 2001 12:15 PM To: Sanders, Richard Cc: Derrick Jr., James; Evans, Mark Subject: Litigation report  A number of pieces of on going litigation and arbitration being conducted on behalf of EML and EMC have very recently come to our attention which we summarise below. We have endeavoured to establish the detail of these cases as quickly as possible, but in some instances await information from outside counsel involved. The summary is therefore necessarily provisional, and will need to be supplemented. There are in addition other claims of which we have been made aware, largely being run by MG Hong Kong and Beijing offices. Details are presently so sketchy that we have not included them until we have been able to verify. A supplementary note on these will follow asap.  1. Corporacion Nacional del  Cobre de Chile (""Codelco"" )  v.  MG Ltd, MGAG and MGCC  This is a major, and very serious claim being brought by the Chilean state copper trading company Codelco against, primarily MG AG of Frankfurt, but also against MG Ltd (now Enron Metals Ltd) for recission of futures contracts on the basis that they were procured by fraud (a bribe of US$1.5m paid to the main Codelco trader by MGAG). We have received a brief summary of the claim from Slaughter & May, the lawyers handling the litigation on behalf of EML, which is attached below. As a result of an indemnity from MG AG, MG Ltd has NO financial exposure other than a credit risk to MG AG.  Legal professional privilege must of course be maintained for this document and its contents, and any dissemination outside the legal dept should be made subject to prior approval by legal.  Trial is set down in the Chancery Division of the High Court in London for 5-6 weeks, commencing October 2001. Significantly, and as you will be aware, High Court proceedings take place in public.   - LT010810084_3.doc    2. MG Ltd v. China Resources National Corporation  Claim in LME arbitration for payment of US$6m futures losses on client contracts. Award published in favour of MGL on liability alone in August 2000. Damages to be assessed. Thereafter Award to be enforced in China. Solicitors: Clyde & Co.   3. MG Ltd v. London Clearing House  Claim in LME arbitration for delivery of defective tin under warrant. Losses believed to be US$800,000. 7 day time bar defence run by the LCH heard as preliminary issue. Award in approx Feb 2000 in favour of MG (ie time bar inapplicable). This has led to resumption of settlement negotiations with Standard Chartered Bank (trading), who put the metal onto warrant originally (and against whom the LCH would have an indemnity claim). The most recent offer from Standard Chartered is to pay US$437,000; but this is subject to unacceptable conditions. Solicitors: Allen & Overy.  4. Nickel explosion in furnace in Cleveland: Scandia Transport  LMEWarehouse/LCH/EMC/Phoenix /EAC/ Cast Alloys (smelter)  Contaminated nickel supplied by EMC into the US. Amount of loss being established now. Incident much less bad than initial reports suggested, and have therefore deferred explosion survey/investigation lined up on urgent basis earlier this week. Expect indemnity claim to be brought against EMC by Phoenixx in LME arbitration; and to pass same claim on to the LCH. Assume possibility of US tort claim also lying direct from Smelter to EMC (awaiting advice from Limor Nissan/Andy Edison on this). Facts should become sufficiently clear to enable rough quantification within next week (w/c 26/3).  NB. Other similarly contaminated shipments from the same warehouse are known to exist. Warnings to other customers are being prepared.  5. LME arbitration: Chinese receiver/ICD/Brandeis/EMC/EML/LCH/Warehouse  Claim brought by Chinese receivers for supply of defective nickel on LME warrant bought through London clearing. Only US$62,000 claim, but involves significant point of principle, hence decision taken to proceed in arbitration. Should in principle be able to pass on incoming claim to LCH (and beyond). Expect unrecoverable costs (internal and external) to exceed the amount of the claim. Solicitors to be instructed w/c 26/3.

Thank you. Jim   -----Original Message----- From:  Paul Johnson, T   Sent: Monday, March 26, 2001 12:15 PM To: Sanders, Richard Cc: Derrick Jr., James; Evans, Mark Subject: Litigation report  A number of pieces of on going litigation and arbitration being conducted on  behalf of EML and EMC have very recently come to our attention which we  summarise below. We have endeavoured to establish the detail of these cases  as quickly as possible, but in some instances await information from outside  counsel involved. The summary is therefore necessarily provisional, and will  need to be supplemented. There are in addition other claims of which we have  been made aware, largely being run by MG Hong Kong and Beijing offices.  Details are presently so sketchy that we have not included them until we have  been able to verify. A supplementary note on these will follow asap.  1. Corporacion Nacional del  Cobre de Chile (""Codelco"" )  v.  MG Ltd, MGAG  and MGCC  This is a major, and very serious claim being brought by the Chilean state  copper trading company Codelco against, primarily MG AG of Frankfurt, but  also against MG Ltd (now Enron Metals Ltd) for recission of futures contracts  on the basis that they were procured by fraud (a bribe of US$1.5m paid to the  main Codelco trader by MGAG). We have received a brief summary of the claim  from Slaughter & May, the lawyers handling the litigation on behalf of EML,  which is attached below. As a result of an indemnity from MG AG, MG Ltd has  NO financial exposure other than a credit risk to MG AG.  Legal professional privilege must of course be maintained for this document  and its contents, and any dissemination outside the legal dept should be made  subject to prior approval by legal.  Trial is set down in the Chancery Division of the High Court in London for  5-6 weeks, commencing October 2001. Significantly, and as you will be aware,  High Court proceedings take place in public.   - LT010810084_3.doc   2. MG Ltd v. China Resources National Corporation  Claim in LME arbitration for payment of US$6m futures losses on client  contracts. Award published in favour of MGL on liability alone in August  2000. Damages to be assessed. Thereafter Award to be enforced in China.  Solicitors: Clyde & Co.   3. MG Ltd v. London Clearing House  Claim in LME arbitration for delivery of defective tin under warrant. Losses  believed to be US$800,000. 7 day time bar defence run by the LCH heard as  preliminary issue. Award in approx Feb 2000 in favour of MG (ie time bar  inapplicable). This has led to resumption of settlement negotiations with  Standard Chartered Bank (trading), who put the metal onto warrant originally  (and against whom the LCH would have an indemnity claim). The most recent  offer from Standard Chartered is to pay US$437,000; but this is subject to  unacceptable conditions. Solicitors: Allen & Overy.  4. Nickel explosion in furnace in Cleveland: Scandia Transport   LMEWarehouse/LCH/EMC/Phoenix /EAC/ Cast Alloys (smelter)  Contaminated nickel supplied by EMC into the US. Amount of loss being  established now. Incident much less bad than initial reports suggested, and  have therefore deferred explosion survey/investigation lined up on urgent  basis earlier this week. Expect indemnity claim to be brought against EMC by  Phoenixx in LME arbitration; and to pass same claim on to the LCH. Assume  possibility of US tort claim also lying direct from Smelter to EMC (awaiting  advice from Limor Nissan/Andy Edison on this). Facts should become  sufficiently clear to enable rough quantification within next week (w/c 26/3).  NB. Other similarly contaminated shipments from the same warehouse are known  to exist. Warnings to other customers are being prepared.  5. LME arbitration: Chinese receiver/ICD/Brandeis/EMC/EML/LCH/Warehouse  Claim brought by Chinese receivers for supply of defective nickel on LME  warrant bought through London clearing. Only US$62,000 claim, but involves  significant point of principle, hence decision taken to proceed in  arbitration. Should in principle be able to pass on incoming claim to LCH  (and beyond). Expect unrecoverable costs (internal and external) to exceed  the amount of the claim. Solicitors to be instructed w/c 26/3.

In its final form this needs to go in late tommorrow afternoon in New Delhi if DPC is to be in a position to commence arbitration against the GOI as quickly as is possible. There is any event 60 days of deadtime. There is no sensible way of getting around that. Accordingly,the sooner DPC starts the process,the sooner it gets to serve the necessary Notice of Arbitration.  It follows that if DPC wishes to get on with matters with the GOI as quickly as is possible,this Notice of Conciliation requires to go in quickly.  Who does DPC wish to appoint as a conciliator (bearing in mind that DPC does not genuinely wish to go through a full-blown conciliation,but simply wishes to tee-up an arbitration on day 61)?  Laurence Street,whose name I have inserted,was the Chief Justice of NSW,and is now in his mid-70s (but fairly fit and active; I saw him last at an ICCA conference in New Delhi about 10 months ago). After ceasing to be a Judge he did quite a lot arbitration. He was also the chairman (and an active chairman) of Fairfax,a major Australian newspaper and media company and an ASX component stock. Fairfax was the subject of a hostile bid,and had a tough time with the Australian government.  As the chairman of Fairfax Street has had some real business experience,but is also a pretty serious lawyer. His main activity these days is mediation. He has done a lot of it,mostly in high-profile Australian corporate disputes. If the conciliation goes anywhere (which I tend to doubt) Street is about the most suitable person I can think of at short notice.  If anyone has any better idea as to the identity of the conciliator,please feel free to say so. If not,given that we have to cut quite quickly,my suggestion and recommendation is that we go with Street.        _____________________________________________________________  This e-mail is sent by or on behalf of Linklaters, 10/F Alexandra House, Chater Road, Hong Kong.

We believe that the current period    of perceived uncertainly is actually an excellent opportunity to buy    into a company that we view as virtually unique in the economy.  We    believe that the energy industry in the United States and world is    undergoing a major transformation and that a very few companies led by    Enron are positioned to create efficiencies and provide the products,    services and flexibility required by customers.  We believe these    opportunities will lead to growth in earnings of 25% over the long term    even if telecommunications makes only slow progress and does not come    close to reaching our expectations.  *  Enron is likely to report strong results in Q1 and 2001 from all core    businesses.  Although mgmt indicated on its March 23rd conf. call that    it was 'very comfortable' with  ests of $1.70 to $1.75, we continue to    be very confident that the company will equal or exceed our $1.80    estimate.  Wholesale Services is likely to have an 'outstanding quarter'    according to CEO Jeff Skilling with a 25% to 35% increase in natural gas    volumes and a doubling of financial volumes.  Retail appears on track to    achieve its $30 billion of new contract signings and turn profitable in    2001 on a fully allocated basis.  Telecom has progressed at a slower    pace than expected by investors as bandwidth trading has turned out to    be more complicated to implement than some believed and the content    business (now without Blockbuster as a partner) appears to also be    developing more slowly than implied by Enron in 2000.  This said, the    business opportunities in both parts of telecom appear to be excellent.  ===========================================================================  Important Disclosures (code definitions attached or available upon request) ENE        : US$ 58.10; CF, CP, M --------------------------------------------------------------------------- *************************************************************************** Copyright 2001 The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.

We believe that the current period    of perceived uncertainly is actually an excellent opportunity to buy    into a company that we view as virtually unique in the economy.  We    believe that the energy industry in the United States and world is    undergoing a major transformation and that a very few companies led by    Enron are positioned to create efficiencies and provide the products,    services and flexibility required by customers.  We believe these    opportunities will lead to growth in earnings of 25% over the long term    even if telecommunications makes only slow progress and does not come    close to reaching our expectations.  *  Enron is likely to report strong results in Q1 and 2001 from all core    businesses.  Although mgmt indicated on its March 23rd conf. call that    it was 'very comfortable' with  ests of $1.70 to $1.75, we continue to    be very confident that the company will equal or exceed our $1.80    estimate.  Wholesale Services is likely to have an 'outstanding quarter'    according to CEO Jeff Skilling with a 25% to 35% increase in natural gas    volumes and a doubling of financial volumes.  Retail appears on track to    achieve its $30 billion of new contract signings and turn profitable in    2001 on a fully allocated basis.  Telecom has progressed at a slower    pace than expected by investors as bandwidth trading has turned out to    be more complicated to implement than some believed and the content    business (now without Blockbuster as a partner) appears to also be    developing more slowly than implied by Enron in 2000.  This said, the    business opportunities in both parts of telecom appear to be excellent.  ===========================================================================  Important Disclosures (code definitions attached or available upon request) ENE        : US$ 58.10; CF, CP, M --------------------------------------------------------------------------- *************************************************************************** Copyright 2001 The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.

Jim   -----Original Message----- From:  Crawford, Sharon   On Behalf Of Keohane, Peter Sent: Tuesday, April 03, 2001 6:15 PM To: Derrick Jr., James; Haedicke, Mark Subject: Canadian Retail  Jim and Mark, as you know, we have established a retail affiliate within  Enron Canada known as Enron Direct.  In addition, EES has a Canadian entity,  EES Canada, which was established for the purposes of entering into some  cross-border transactions in Canada.  For various reasons, it has been  decided to roll Enron Direct into EES Canada reporting, commercially, to Rob  Milnthorp, who will in turn report to Dave Delainey.  There are two  legal/governance-related issues that I wanted to raise with you:  1. Governance:  As a result, it will be necessary to make various corporate  re-organizations to EES Canada.  This will include having EES Canada  established as an Alberta corporation, where Enron Canada has, and Enron  Direct will have, its principal Canadian office.  In relation to this, I was  considering that EES Canada should be organized consistent with Enron Canada,  with two Canadian resident nominee directors and Canadian-resident officers.   A few years back, it was decided, for corporate law and, more importantly,  tax-related ""permanent establishment"" issues, that all directors and officers  of Enron Canada would be Canadian-resident employees of Enron Canada.   Accordingly, Enron Canada was re-organized with a nominee board of directors  consisting of Rob Milnthorp (as the senior commercial employee) and me (as  the senior legal employee) with a Canadian slate of officers being the  Vice-Presidents or Managing Directors in Canada responsible for the various  commercial or commercial-support groups.  I was thinking of doing likewise  with EES Canada.  Although I have not yet obtained a copy of the corporate  records for EES Canada, I believe the current directors of EES Canada are Jim  and an outside lawyer at Blake, Cassels & Graydon in Toronto, Ernest McNee.   I am not sure, but it is also likely that various US-based employees of EES  are designated as the officers of EES Canada.  Would it be appropriate to  re-organize EES Canada along the same lines that Enron Canada has been  organized, or do you have concerns?  2. Law Firm:  Following-up on our conversation last week, I want to confirm  that our continued use of Donahue Ernst & Young for this retail project was  ""grandfathered"" on the basis that they were ""up the learning curve"" on a  number of the contracting, regulatory, licensing and market participation  issues.  There is one twist, however, with respect to EES Canada.  Although I  was not involved, I believe that EES Canada was established to execute on  some gas transactions in Ontario with the use of a Blakes partner in Toronto,  Ernest McNee.  However, as the focus of the business initiative in Canada  will, at least in the near future, be more involved and predominantly, if not  entirely, in Alberta; and as Donahue Ernst & Young is involved in regulatory  proceedings on our behalf with respect to market design issues affecting the  Alberta gas and power markets, as well as being familiar with the licensing  and contracting requirements for Enron Direct in Alberta; and given my  understanding that Blakes' involvement with EES Canada has been relatively  limited, I think it would make sense to have Donahue Ernst & Young continue  on with this matter.  I am, however, sensitive to Jim's concerns, and  therefore wanted your thoughts on the matter.  I look forward to hearing from you.

"Mary Nell, no one could have worked harder or better than you in the effort to bring about a just decision in this matter.  Thank you for your tireless efforts--I am proud to serve on the Enron team with you. All the best. Jim   -----Original Message----- From:  Browning, Mary Nell   Sent: Wednesday, April 04, 2001 1:59 PM To: Derrick Jr., James; Brown, Michael; Sherriff, John; Evans, Mark; Dyson, Fernley; Chivers, Paul; Frevert, Mark; Whalley, Greg; McConnell, Mike; Gentle, Jackie; Sanders, Richard; Wright, Claire; Patel - Tax, Raj; Rogers, Rex Cc: Harper, Richard; Turner, Paul; Crilly, Peter Subject: CATS litigation  Disappointingly, the House of Lords ruled 5 - 0 against Enron in the CATS litigation today.  This will mean that we will repay to the CATS parties approximately $150 million plus interest and court costs, putting the final figure at an estimated $155-160 million.  We expect to be invoiced for the principal amount in the next week or so; sorting costs and interest may take as long as 60 days.  The written opinion reflects a determination on the part of the Lords to rule against us regardless of what the contract says.  The opinion seeks to conclude ""what rational businessmen could have intended"" rather than applying the provisions of the contract.    For example, Lord Hoffman (author of the primary opinion) makes it clear that the  ""retrospective consequences"" of discovering a latent defect after payments have been made (and would therefore need to be refunded) are unacceptable.  His view seems to be that because we were not ready to flow J-Block gas during the period of the T-6 leak, we are not damaged and therefore not entitled to relief under the contract.  Furthermore, he says that the Commencement Date notice sent by the CATS parties was in the nature of a declaration and as long as it is sent in good faith it is effective.  As far as the price reduction formula in Clause 7.5, Lord Hoffman opines that the clause is not operative until TGTL had tied in the J-Block field.  The contract makes no reference to this requirement.  Hoffman's view is that it is only upon tie-in that the CATS parties' obligation to provide the Transportation Service is triggered and therefore there can be no price reduction for not providing the service unless tie-in is complete. This statement is in stark contrast with Hoffman's earlier statement in the opinion that upon the giving of the Commencement Date notice the CATS parties have an absolute obligation to provide the Transportation Service.  Equally disappointing and surprising is the fact that the Lords rejected our submission for reimbursement of our costs incurred in connection with the restitution issue.  As you may recall, restitution was the primary issue upon which the CATS parties obtained leave to appeal, and they conceded the point at the commencement of the hearing.  Reimbursement of these costs should have been a given.   Although I have not yet been able to speak to our most senior barrister, our other counsel have assessed the opinion as ""appalling"" and ""pathetic,"" and describe the situation as one where Enron has been ""stitched up"".  Unfortunately, given that this is the court of last resort in this country (except of course the Court of Human Rights), there is not an avenue for recourse.  In conclusion may I say that although we did not get the result we wanted or expected from the House of Lords, I very much appreciate all the support from each of you for these past six years.  The case has been a roller coaster ride;  I hope our earlier victory in the Court of Appeal will evidence in fact that some tribunals in this country recognize that we did get it right.   Please call me if you wish to discuss the case in any further detail, or if you wish to have a copy of the opinion.  My telephone number is 011 44 207 783 6582.

The LNG market looks very promising and the team has already done a number of spot cargoes.    With that evolution we will make the following changes:  the Spanish team headed by Mariano Gentilini, will now report to Eric Shaw who will then have origination responsibilities for the entire origination and asset development efforts on the European Continent.  The Spanish energy markets are becoming increasingly integrated into the neighbouring continental energy markets, with significant cross border opportunities and we expect these changes to help us maximise our information sharing and cross-border opportunities. The Arcos power station development effort has made significant progress over the past few years under Eric Gonzales's leadership.  We are entering the final permitting stage, and we expect to begin construction by the end of this year.  We would like to thank Eric for his contribution over the past three years, and we are confident that the strong team he has built will successfully complete this critical project.

Thank you.  -----Original Message----- From:  Linnell, Elizabeth   Sent: Friday, April 06, 2001 9:27 AM To: Derrick Jr., James; Buy, Rick; Fastow, Andrew S.; Donovan, Bill; Olson, Cindy Subject: iBuyit - Need your input  The Corp. design of the iBuyit system is well underway.  We appreciate your initial support of the system and would like to solicit your input on some system details that will be custom to the Corp. deployment and may be used eventually for other business units' standards.  Bob Butts has approved the following request limits for Corp. Accounting, and we need to get your ""OK"" as well for implementation.  Please call me at x33896 if you have any questions or would like to discuss this proposal.  Request limits:  The system allows setup of graduated dollar limits for order amounts based on job classification, which are listed below, with some examples of items that might fit within each limit.  Requests with totals below these limits would flow through the system without any further authorization required.  Exceptions to these levels can be made on an individual basis, and those individuals will be identified as we get closer to implementation.   Level 1 Clerks/Sr. Clerks $250  Routine office supplies, beverages, pager, computer keyboard Level 2 Admins/Specialists $500  Small furniture, larger supply orders, palm pilot Level 3 Sr. Specialist  $5,00  Computer, fax machine, furniture Level 4 Manager  $25,000 Level 5 Director/Sr. Director $100,000 Level 6 Vice President  $250,000 Level 7 Managing Director $500,000 Level 8 EVP   $1.0M Please note that these amounts fall within the Enron standards for invoice approval authority.  In our meetings with Stakeholders and Change Agents, we got a clear message that lower ordering authorization was preferable.    Approval Flow:  The system allows approval flow to be customized to each department.  For example, Public Affairs could require a request for $650 placed by a clerk to flow first to an Admin for approval, then to a Sr. Specialist or higher for final issuance.  The Accounting department could require a request for $650 placed by a clerk to go directly to a Director for the first level of approval.  Under the limits proposed below, a $650 request by a Sr. Specialist would not be routed, as it would fall under the specified ordering authorized level.  As we get closer to the implementation date, we will work with the designated Stakeholders to design the approval flow for your departments.  Controls:  As with any system, a concentrated effort can bypass built-in controls.  As a control mechanism, we've proposed that SAP generate a periodic report so that cost center owners can conveniently track ordering activity.  The team is working on the best way to generate and deliver this report.  I appreciate your ""OK"" on the above, or any feedback you might have.

It seems to me that we want to consolidate our Dec/Jan/Good Interest into one arbitration against each of MSEB and GOM, rather than separate the claims further and thereby encourage MSEB/GOM to cure some claims (e.g., Dec/Good Interest) and leave the January claim hanging out there alone.  I understand your issues with rag-tag but am assuming that the rag-tag label does not apply to Good Interest.

In particular,the corporate decision about what the end game and desired end result are to consist in.  Accordingly,I now look upon the proposed GOM and MSEB arbitrations as primarily a means of setting up the case for PPA termination in due course. In the light of this:-  (1) The MSEB arbitration ought now to deal with misdeclaration and claim payment of the January 2001 billing,as well as the December 2001 billing. I expect that we shall also put in the subsequent misdeclaration episodes. I see little value in putting in the older claims (i.e., the arrears and sums withheld),mainly because Kelly Quinn's analysis of them tends to show that many of DPC's claims are dud.  (2) There is no longer any useful purpose served in stripping the MSEB arbitration down to misdeclaration only. Further,not merely I am more convinced than I was that the MSEB was not entitled to withhold against the December 2000 billing,but I think that DPC has a 50:50 case that the MSEB was obliged to pay the January 2001 billing clean.  (3) As I see it,there will be two arbitrations against GOM (the SSA and the Guarantee) and one against the MSEB. However,if we wish to harass the GOM and set up further PPA termination grounds,we might well wish to do something forceful and litigious when (as I confidently predict) the notice under the escrow agreement is not responded to by the MSEB and the Indian banks. The notice only really works as and when the Indian banks are threatened.  -----Original Message----- From: Bruce.Lundstrom@enron.com [mailto:Bruce.Lundstrom@enron.com] Sent: Sunday, April 08, 2001 7:12 PM To: cwalker@linklaters.com Cc: Sandeep.Katwala@enron.com; Rob.Walls@enron.com Subject: MSEB and GOM Arbitrations   Christopher -  Help me to understand the plan for the MSEB and GOM arbitrations for December, January and Interest.  In how many pieces do we anticipate submitting these arbitrations?  What strategy is behind the submission of separate submissions?  I remember that we wanted to separate the MSEB January submission, at one point, to hasten the disposition of the misdeclaration issue.  Does this make sense given the events of the last few weeks and the sponsors' sentiments about additional capital for the project?

After retirement from the Supreme Court he has pursued a career as an arbitrator and has been involved on a number of international arbitrations. As a separate career he provides legal opinions on commercial matters. He is currently recognised as one of if not the outstanding senior lawyers in India. He with Justice Chandrachud are probably India's best known arbitrators.  Has an outstanding reputation as an intellect to be reckoned with - in the conferences I have had with him (on Metgas) and in Chris and Atul's dealings with him you have to marvel at his speed of thought despite the years.  Our primary concern with him appearing on the other side either for GOI or GOM as their arbitrator, apart from his capability, is the simple fact that he is extremely busy. If GOI or GOM want to slow down an arbitration proceeding then in Atul's words ""there can be no better choice than Mr Bhagwati"".  He has chaired several commissions - eg he wrote the revised Takeover Code. He has also been responsible for much of the insolvency legislation.  I don't have sufficient details on Justices Chandrachud and Chandurkar and could I please ask Chris to forward these to Bruce.

"FYI   -----Original Message----- From:  Butcher, Sharon   Sent: Thursday, April 12, 2001 6:40 PM To: Derrick Jr., James Subject: UT - Summer Clerks at Enron  Dear Jim:  Mr. Chike Okpara and Mr. Reginald Sewell have enthusiastically accepted our offer to work at Enron as Summer Associates/Clerks during Summer 2001.  The Term begins on or about May 14, 2001, and ends on or about August 17, 2001.  Both gentlemen indicated that they might need a few days after school ends on May 11, 2001 and begins again on August 20, 2001.  We indicated that we have some flexibility with respect to the start date and we are waiting to receive information from Mr. Okpara and Mr. Sewell with respect to the dates.  As per our initial discussions, it is my understanding that Enron would like the students to rotate through Enron Broadband Services, Enron Energy Services, and Enron Wholesale Services.  Do you want me to include Enron Global Finance, Enron Transportation Services and Enron Corp. in their rotations?  Depending upon the number of Enron entities participating in the rotations, each student will spend approximately 2-3 weeks in each business unit, if there are five business units.  In the event we only have three business units, each student will spend approximately 4 weeks in each area.   I will make sure that Mr. Okpara and Mr. Sewell receive a personal introduction to Enron via our orientation process.  Further, I will participate on a weekly basis as a mentor and liaison with each student.  In addition, should we need assignments from Corporate Legal, I will be happy to coordinate the same.  During our program, I envision their duties as follows:   1.  Provide legal research assistance, including the preparation of legal memorandum and other documents,   on various issues;   2.  Attend meetings and conference calls as required by their respective assignments; and    3.  Undertake other legal duties as required by the respective law departments.  I have also spoken to Lisa Falick, Attorney Recruitment Coordinator at Vinson & Elkins.  She will forward to me the Summer Associate/Clerk activities list upon its completion.    Please advise if you would like for me to take any additional steps.    Thank you.  Sharon",rob.walls@enron.com,james.derrick@enron.com,FW: UT - Summer Clerks at Enron,2001-04-12 17:11:22-07:00,sent

Jim   -----Original Message----- From:  Crawford, Sharon   On Behalf Of Keohane, Peter Sent: Tuesday, April 03, 2001 6:15 PM To: Derrick Jr., James; Haedicke, Mark Subject: Canadian Retail  Jim and Mark, as you know, we have established a retail affiliate within  Enron Canada known as Enron Direct.  In addition, EES has a Canadian entity,  EES Canada, which was established for the purposes of entering into some  cross-border transactions in Canada.  For various reasons, it has been  decided to roll Enron Direct into EES Canada reporting, commercially, to Rob  Milnthorp, who will in turn report to Dave Delainey.  There are two  legal/governance-related issues that I wanted to raise with you:  1. Governance:  As a result, it will be necessary to make various corporate  re-organizations to EES Canada.  This will include having EES Canada  established as an Alberta corporation, where Enron Canada has, and Enron  Direct will have, its principal Canadian office.  In relation to this, I was  considering that EES Canada should be organized consistent with Enron Canada,  with two Canadian resident nominee directors and Canadian-resident officers.   A few years back, it was decided, for corporate law and, more importantly,  tax-related ""permanent establishment"" issues, that all directors and officers  of Enron Canada would be Canadian-resident employees of Enron Canada.   Accordingly, Enron Canada was re-organized with a nominee board of directors  consisting of Rob Milnthorp (as the senior commercial employee) and me (as  the senior legal employee) with a Canadian slate of officers being the  Vice-Presidents or Managing Directors in Canada responsible for the various  commercial or commercial-support groups.  I was thinking of doing likewise  with EES Canada.  Although I have not yet obtained a copy of the corporate  records for EES Canada, I believe the current directors of EES Canada are Jim  and an outside lawyer at Blake, Cassels & Graydon in Toronto, Ernest McNee.   I am not sure, but it is also likely that various US-based employees of EES  are designated as the officers of EES Canada.  Would it be appropriate to  re-organize EES Canada along the same lines that Enron Canada has been  organized, or do you have concerns?  2. Law Firm:  Following-up on our conversation last week, I want to confirm  that our continued use of Donahue Ernst & Young for this retail project was  ""grandfathered"" on the basis that they were ""up the learning curve"" on a  number of the contracting, regulatory, licensing and market participation  issues.  There is one twist, however, with respect to EES Canada.  Although I  was not involved, I believe that EES Canada was established to execute on  some gas transactions in Ontario with the use of a Blakes partner in Toronto,  Ernest McNee.  However, as the focus of the business initiative in Canada  will, at least in the near future, be more involved and predominantly, if not  entirely, in Alberta; and as Donahue Ernst & Young is involved in regulatory  proceedings on our behalf with respect to market design issues affecting the  Alberta gas and power markets, as well as being familiar with the licensing  and contracting requirements for Enron Direct in Alberta; and given my  understanding that Blakes' involvement with EES Canada has been relatively  limited, I think it would make sense to have Donahue Ernst & Young continue  on with this matter.  I am, however, sensitive to Jim's concerns, and  therefore wanted your thoughts on the matter.  I look forward to hearing from you.

We appreciate your initial support of the system and would like to solicit your input on some system details that will be custom to the Corp. deployment and may be used eventually for other business units' standards.  Bob Butts has approved the following request limits for Corp. Accounting, and we need to get your ""OK"" as well for implementation.  Please call me at x33896 if you have any questions or would like to discuss this proposal.  Request limits:  The system allows setup of graduated dollar limits for order amounts based on job classification, which are listed below, with some examples of items that might fit within each limit.  Requests with totals below these limits would flow through the system without any further authorization required.  Exceptions to these levels can be made on an individual basis, and those individuals will be identified as we get closer to implementation.   Level 1 Clerks/Sr. Clerks $250  Routine office supplies, beverages, pager, computer keyboard Level 2 Admins/Specialists $500  Small furniture, larger supply orders, palm pilot Level 3 Sr. Specialist  $5,00  Computer, fax machine, furniture Level 4 Manager  $25,000 Level 5 Director/Sr. Director $100,000 Level 6 Vice President  $250,000 Level 7 Managing Director $500,000 Level 8 EVP   $1.0M Please note that these amounts fall within the Enron standards for invoice approval authority.  In our meetings with Stakeholders and Change Agents, we got a clear message that lower ordering authorization was preferable.    Approval Flow:  The system allows approval flow to be customized to each department.  For example, Public Affairs could require a request for $650 placed by a clerk to flow first to an Admin for approval, then to a Sr. Specialist or higher for final issuance.  The Accounting department could require a request for $650 placed by a clerk to go directly to a Director for the first level of approval.  Under the limits proposed below, a $650 request by a Sr. Specialist would not be routed, as it would fall under the specified ordering authorized level.  As we get closer to the implementation date, we will work with the designated Stakeholders to design the approval flow for your departments.  Controls:  As with any system, a concentrated effort can bypass built-in controls.  As a control mechanism, we've proposed that SAP generate a periodic report so that cost center owners can conveniently track ordering activity.  The team is working on the best way to generate and deliver this report.  I appreciate your ""OK"" on the above, or any feedback you might have.

I am circulating this as a preliminary draft to lawyers only in the first instance, in the knowledge that it probably needs to be refined (and abbreviated) before it goes to wider circulation. Please note also that it has been prepared without the benefit of having seen the Godbole Committee Report (now out and on sale on the streets of Bombay). From a commercial point of view, of immediate interest is the analysis in relation ot the decision on whether or not to complete the construction of Phase II and whether or not to continue operation of the plant. On both counts we identify significant risks to DPC of ceasing construction / operation and we really should consider the overall termination strategy in the round before decisions on this front are taken, however obvious the answers may seem to be from a purely financial point of view. The note is limited to the process under the PPA and coes not consider, for instance, the influence of Lenders on the process or the role of the LNG suppliers. It also ignores MetGas. I am happy to expand the note to cover these aspects, and certainly in relation to the Lenders' position would need and welcome Lance's collaboration. Finally, I am also sure that changes will be necessary to take on board the views of Gail and Christopher in relation to how the arbitration proceedings would progress in parallel with the termination process.

"I am fine with your proposed selection of counsel. Jim   -----Original Message----- From:  Lee, Matthias   Sent: Monday, April 16, 2001 8:35 PM To: Derrick Jr., James Cc: Aronowitz, Alan; Poon, Angeline; Lee, Matthias Subject: Tenancy dispute - approval for engaging external counsel  Jim  I am managing a dispute here in Singapore involving the tenancy of one of our expats (John Chismar). Essentially, there was an agreement for an early termination on 31 May 2001, but the Landlord is now seeking to ""rescind"" the early termination agreement on grounds that we have allegedly prevented his contractors from inspecting the premises thereby breaching a condition of  termination agreement.   I am of the view that the allegations are without merit but there is significant acrimony with the Landlord and all attempts at reasoning with him have failed. John Chismar is of course adamant about moving out and has in fact agreed to a new lease of different premises. The Landlord (who is an ex-lawyer) is likely to be uncooperative when we try to hand over at the end of the month and withhold the deposit of S$42,750 (approx. US$24,000) and try to sue for rent.  In anticipation of litigation, I would like to instruct external counsel to help me manage this matter. I took the liberty to mention this to John C and he is agreeable to the course of action.  I would like to propose Hri Kumar of Drew & Napier whom I have worked with and instructed for similar matters in my previous employment. Drew & Napier is a prominent law firm in Singapore (especially for litigation). They have a joint venture with Freshfields of the UK which operate here in Singapore as Freshfields Drew & Napier dealing with high end corporate work. However, I note that Drew & Napier is not on our approved list of external counsel and write for your approval that I instruct them for this matter.

We appreciate your initial support of the system and would like to solicit your input on some system details that will be custom to the Corp. deployment and may be used eventually for other business units' standards.  Bob Butts has approved the following request limits for Corp. Accounting, and we need to get your ""OK"" as well for implementation.  Please call me at x33896 if you have any questions or would like to discuss this proposal.  Request limits:  The system allows setup of graduated dollar limits for order amounts based on job classification, which are listed below, with some examples of items that might fit within each limit.  Requests with totals below these limits would flow through the system without any further authorization required.  Exceptions to these levels can be made on an individual basis, and those individuals will be identified as we get closer to implementation.   Level 1 Clerks/Sr. Clerks $250  Routine office supplies, beverages, pager, computer keyboard Level 2 Admins/Specialists $500  Small furniture, larger supply orders, palm pilot Level 3 Sr. Specialist  $5,00  Computer, fax machine, furniture Level 4 Manager  $25,000 Level 5 Director/Sr. Director $100,000 Level 6 Vice President  $250,000 Level 7 Managing Director $500,000 Level 8 EVP   $1.0M Please note that these amounts fall within the Enron standards for invoice approval authority.  In our meetings with Stakeholders and Change Agents, we got a clear message that lower ordering authorization was preferable.    Approval Flow:  The system allows approval flow to be customized to each department.  For example, Public Affairs could require a request for $650 placed by a clerk to flow first to an Admin for approval, then to a Sr. Specialist or higher for final issuance.  The Accounting department could require a request for $650 placed by a clerk to go directly to a Director for the first level of approval.  Under the limits proposed below, a $650 request by a Sr. Specialist would not be routed, as it would fall under the specified ordering authorized level.  As we get closer to the implementation date, we will work with the designated Stakeholders to design the approval flow for your departments.  Controls:  As with any system, a concentrated effort can bypass built-in controls.  As a control mechanism, we've proposed that SAP generate a periodic report so that cost center owners can conveniently track ordering activity.  The team is working on the best way to generate and deliver this report.  I appreciate your ""OK"" on the above, or any feedback you might have.

I am happy to report that our 2002  Institute Co-Chairs, Brad Keithley of Jones Day in Dallas and Jack Lynch of BP  in Houston, will be joining us at the meeting as ex officio members of the  Executive Committee.  Finally, attached are the results  of our poll of the 2001 Institute attendees and of our Advisory Board concerning  the preferred location for our 2002 Institute next February. It appears that all  roads lead to Houston this year. With the results of the San  Antonio program and a Houston program in hand, we will be in a better  position to determine the best home(s) for the Institute in the  future.

Subject: Piedra Buena Dispute/Litigation   As you might recall from the monthly litigation reports, Enron America del Sur has been involved in an ongoing dispute with Central Piedra Buena (""CPB"") relating to approximately $3.3 million that Enron claims it is owed pursuant to a 1999 natural gas sales agreement.    More specifically, pursuant to the sales agreement, Enron was to sell natural gas to CPB.  Enron bought this gas from a gas distribution company called Total.  The sales agreement and the purchase agreement contained similar provisions and Enron acted primarily as a middleman in the transactions.   Beginning in December 1999, after a change in CPB's management, CPB stopped paying Enron for the gas that was supplied.  As a basis for non-payment, CPB claimed that Enron had made numerous mistakes in calculating what was due from CPB.  CPB also made vague allegations of wrongdoing on Enron's part. The parties (including Total) have been negotiating for months in an effort to resolve their disputes; however, these negotiations have been unsuccessful.  We would like approval to initiate an arbitration against CPB for the money they owe us which, in turn, we owe to Total. Although we believe that CPB may have set-off rights for a very small amount of the sums claimed, their failure to make any reasonable offer to resolve this matter has necessitated that we resort to arbitration.    Guido Tawil of the Bomchil firm has been helping us in our efforts to negotiate a settlement and would represent Enron in the arbitration.  Pursuant to the parties' agreement, this would be an ICC arbitration, would occur in Buenos Aires and Argentine law would apply. Additionally, several arbitrators have been interviewed and, in Guido's opinion, our best choice is Sergio La Pera, a commercial law specialist who has a good bit of experience as an arbitrator.  According to Guido, Mr. La Pera is available and wiling to serve on the arbitration panel.  Should you need any additional information or have any questions, please let me know.  Thanks.

It is becoming more and more difficult to avoid talking about this insurance as the exposure is often discussed in the press.  Do you have any thoughts on disclosure to NEPCO?

We need to check out with Enron Insurance group to determine if our current employment practice liability insurance covers a situation like this.  The distinction is that if the plaintiff employee names the company, we're covered, but he/she names only the supervisor ""personally"" would the Enron insurance decline coverage?    By copy to Dick Vincent, I am asking him to confirm this issue with our insurance program.

Our ASAP's are our summaries of recent developments in employment matters. This ASAP addresses a recent case from the Washington State Supreme Court in which that court held that individual supervisors can be held personally liable for acts of unlawful harassment and discrimination.  This ruling relates to the Washington state discrimination statute and not Title VII. This ruling is contrary to federal law under Title VII where individual supervisors are not personally liable for such acts.  Similarly, individual supervisors are not subject to personal liability under the Texas Commission on Human Rights Act.  It may be prudent for employers with workers in Washington to review insurance and indemnity agreements to determine if these contracts cover supervisors who may be sued for acts in the course and scope of their employment.   http://www.littler.com/nwsltr/asap_scott_paper.html <http://www.littler.com/nwsltr/asap_scott_paper.html>  Please double click on the above link to access the ASAP.

To summarize:  Retained Johnny Veeder QC Jonathan Sumption QC Lord Grabiner QC  Retained (Subject to Confirmation on Monday) Stewart Boyd QC Gordon Pollock QC  Possible Others Peter Goldsmith QC Sydney Kentridge QC  Bruce  ---------------------- Forwarded by Bruce Lundstrom/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT on 04/29/2001 02:51 PM ---------------------------   ""Walker, Christopher"" <christopher.walker@linklaters.com> on 04/27/2001 09:27:33 AM To: ""'Bruce.Lundstrom@enron.com'"" <Bruce.Lundstrom@enron.com>, ""Walker, Christopher"" <christopher.walker@linklaters.com> cc: Rob.Walls@enron.com, ""Katwala, Sandeep""  <sandeep.katwala@linklaters.com>   Subject: Dabhol Power Project - Counsel   Bruce,  Here is the position:-  (1) Johnny Veeder QC has been retained.  (2) Subject to receiving a confirmatory e-mail overnight,I have retained (on a no-cost basis) Stewart Boyd QC and Gordon Pollock QC. (Boyd wrote the standard English law text,and we thought about using him last time around. Pollock will be well known to Jim Derrick,as having acted against Enron in J Block. Boyd and Pollock are in the same Chambers as johnny Veeder QC,and they share the same Clerk. I am waiting for written confirmation from him by e-mail that they are retained as stand-ins for Johnny Veeder QC as we may require them).  (3) I have retained Jonathan Sumption QC and Lord Grabiner QC. I have done so by giving them a small amount of ""homework"" to do. There are a number of PPA questions where second and third views are useful in any case,so the costs are not wasted in any event. We are not commited in any case to using them as advocates,although we might very well wish to have the option on them.  The five names mentioned represent very much the magic circle for arbitration work. Indeed,Grabiner,Pollock and Sumption are the magic circle for almost all conceivable commercial litigation purposes in London (and many that are not).  There are two others possibly who are widely regarded as being magic circle members. These are: (a) Peter Goldsmith QC and (b) Sydney Kentridge QC.  Peter Goldsmith QC does not do a great deal of arbitration work,but he is a recognised ""name"".  Sydney Kentridge QC is now in his mid-70s,and is virtually exclusively an appellate advocate. He does not do ""heavy"" cases at first instance anymore. I think that you could fairly safely treat it as inherently unlikely in the extreme that he would take this one on for the MSEB etc.  The cost of taking Peter Goldsmith QC off-side through the ""homework"" route would be roughly ?10k or ?12k,perhaps a little more (but not a great deal more). Please let me know whether you wish me to do this.  At the end of the day,the bar in London is big enough and deep enough for the MSEB etc. always to be able to find an advocate who is good. My efforts have been directed to:(a) getting a pool of the best on-side for DPC,as needed; and (b) putting the same people off-side for the MSEB etc. I would not have thought it useful or necessary to go further than Peter Goldsmith QC in that excericse.",james.derrick@enron.com,bruce.lundstrom@enron.com,Dabhol Power Project - Counsel,2001-04-29 12:58:16-07:00,received

Unfortunately, without the involvement of Legal, the deal was executed without paper, but on the basis that it was subject to our standard ISDA documentation.  The Confirm was sent out on that basis but not executed by the counterparty.  There was some agreement on guarantee support, but as this was less clear to get the underlying deal put in place, with the approval of Credit, we gave up the requirement for the guarantee in our subsequent discussions and demand letter.  We want to pursue the matter by commencing litigation.  Lakeside is traditionally represented by Blakes.  My suggestion would be to use the Duncan McCachen firm, a litigation boutique who we have used in the past (CIBC litigation).

Alternatively, I would suggest Clarke Hunter of Macleod Dixon who is currently representing us on the NGX litigation and who also has a good understanding of out trading business.

In order to do so, it must enter a Competitive Electric Service Supplier Agreement with a local utility, Western Mass.  The agreement governs the relationship between EES and the utility (subject to the utility's tariff and PUC regulations), and mainly concerns billing and other administrative matters.   I would not expect large dollar disputes to arise under the agreement (barring another California situation).  The agreement presently calls for arbitration in Boston of any disputes.  There are no rules specified.  I recommend that we agree to arbitration in Boston but specify that:  (1) the Federal Arbitration Act will apply (to give a legal framework to the arbitration and to enable EES to invoke federal court jurisdiction); (2) the arbitration will be conducted in accordance with the CPR Rules for Self-Administered Arbitrations (although AAA or JAMS would also be acceptable);  and (3) one arbitrator will be used in the amount in dispute is less than $1 million but if greater then the parties will use a panel of three arbitrators, with each party selecting one (under CPR Rules the two party appointed arbitrators select the chair or, failing agreement, the CPR submits a list of 5 from which the chair is determined by the highest order of preference of the parties).   Please let me know if this meets your approval.  Thanks. ",c..williams@enron.com,james.derrick@enron.com,FW: Massachusetts Venue Question,2001-05-01 07:46:57-07:00,sent

"Below is the response from our broker commenting on the coverage issue posed by NEPCO.  Our confidential approach to this policy is in jeopardy as more and more people are creating a need to know and the ""traffic"" on this topic (internally and externally) has increase considerably. On this Nepco inquiry,  I suggest that I speak with David Lund on the coverage and request that he keep same confidential and advise his operations people that they need not pursue the issue any further.  Please advise if you concur?  On this same subject, I have received a request from Michelle Cash to notify our insurers of a potential ""age discrimination "" claim.  EEOC has made an ""inquiry"",  which means (according to Michelle), that they have received a complaint and want information. I have discussed with our broker, and they recommend, based upon review of the reporting provisions in the policy, that we file a report of a potential claim with underwriters. I do not have the all facts nor do I have copies of any of any documents, however, understand that this arises from the ""Performance Review process"".

Our ASAP's are our summaries of recent developments in employment matters. This ASAP addresses a recent case from the Washington State Supreme Court in which that court held that individual supervisors can be held personally liable for acts of unlawful harassment and discrimination.  This ruling relates to the Washington state discrimination statute and not Title VII. This ruling is contrary to federal law under Title VII where individual supervisors are not personally liable for such acts.  Similarly, individual supervisors are not subject to personal liability under the Texas Commission on Human Rights Act.  It may be prudent for employers with workers in Washington to review insurance and indemnity agreements to determine if these contracts cover supervisors who may be sued for acts in the course and scope of their employment. http://www.littler.com/nwsltr/asap_scott_paper.html <http://www.littler.com/nwsltr/asap_scott_paper.html> Please double click on the above link to access the ASAP.

"=09hmmm.   -----Original Message----- From: =09Cline, Wade =20 Sent:=09Thursday, May 10, 2001 11:01 AM To:=09McDonald, Rebecca; Hughes, James A.; Walls Jr., Rob; Lundstrom, Bruce Cc:=09McGregor, Neil Subject:=09Renegotiation thoughts  Below is an e-mail I worked up on my renegotiation thoughts for your readin= g pleasure. Since this idea came up on our Thursday call, I will go ahead a= nd send the e-mail out for feedback. We can discuss any thoughts you have o= n this either Friday or on a subsequent call.  Regards, Col. Travis  _____________________________________  The thoughts below are not for our meeting on Friday, but they represent so= mething that I think we need to be prepared for at some point after Friday.=  I ask your patience in presenting some thoughts on a possible renegotiatio= n strategy.  Background:  We are going down a termination path, which we are willing to go all the wa= y on. We also are aiming for a buyout option at some point.=20  Lenders are concerned about the path, as we all are, and are taking some ti= me to get comfortable with the steps. This has led to a delay in approval f= or PTN and perhaps a delayed approval after PTN for a Transfer Notice. Whil= e the lenders may know the ultimate resolution is a termination or buyout, = the lenders are concerned that DPC has not done all in its power to find an=  amicable solution through negotiation. Given hundreds of published comment= s, the Godbole Committee report, our understanding of GOM finances, politic= al party differences, weak coalition gov'ts, etc., we know that renegotiati= on is going to be almost impossible. But the lenders are not there yet, and=  in this period, we don't want to lose the lenders completely. We need lend= ers and their approval for a buyout, as well as a termination. Plus we don'= t want to upset lenders completely to a point they ask ""what value is DPC (= Enron/GE/Bechtel) bringing to the project?"" and thus decide to cut the equi= ty out and to seek some other solution without the current equity.=20  Government parties (MSEB, GOM, GOI) are concerned about this path as they d= on't fully appreciate what it means for them or DPC. In addition, this hard= ball tactic is not their normal style, although they are capable of being f= airly rough when they get pinned down. This is especially true since our as= sets and people are on their home turf. The hardball, while we are used to = it and believe it is the proper strategy, is leading to hardening of positi= ons by government, and will make subsequent discussions (whether on transfe= r amount, buyout option or any renegotiation) more difficult. We also shoul= d be thinking of keeping doors open, if only a slight bit, with government,=  as we will need some level of cooperation for buyout, transfer amount or a= ny renegotiation.  I think we should develop a renegotiation option that is a combination of t= hings. First, something that if our plans go out of control, we have someth= ing we can fallback on as a last option. While renegotiation and the conseq= uent reduction in equity returns might be an unattractive option, I think w= e can make it more attractive than it currently is, as you can see from the=  list below. This provides some ""face-saving"" option for the government, if=  they choose to go this route. Second, it is something that shows the lende= rs (who we have to care about) and the government (who we care less about, = but still care somewhat due to need for their approvals and cooperation) th= at we are not slamming the door shut on any further discussions. Third, it = is something that will be very difficult for the government and perhaps the=  lenders, fuel supplier and shipowners to agree to, and thus we will probab= ly get to the goal of termination regardless.  Right now, the lenders are our immediate hurdle with the challenge of getti= ng them over the hump of a quick PTN and a simultaneous or shortly thereaft= er Transfer Notice. So I would recommend we discuss the plan below internal= ly and modify it as needed. Before we would show it to anyone, we would dec= ide what is our minimum (I propose the attached be our minimum) and we will=  beef it up as needed. If required, we will have it ready to show to lender= s at an appropriate time, or to have a senior Enron executive such as Ken o= r Rebecca or a Houston-approved emissary get it to GOI. We would say this i= s what we are willing to do to avoid final termination (we still will proce= ed with PTN and Transfer Notice, as soon as lender consent obtained), but g= overnment and other counterparties must agree to obligations contained in t= he list. This shows the lenders that we are willing to at least play the re= negotiation game.=20  Here's the Dabhol Wishlist in short bulletpoints. These need work and furth= er scrubbing, but before spending significant time on this, I want to get i= nput from management if this is something they would want us to explore. Ag= ain, I think these are our minimum, worst case things, so we could beef it = up accordingly.  1. Dabhol agrees to not terminate project. [In light of recent events and h= igh level concerns meetings being held in Maharashtra and Delhi, we should = not understimate the value this concession provides to GOI and GOM.]  2. Dabhol agrees to tariff reduction from ECS of Phase II on LNG of 50 pais= e for 1st 10 years, up to Rs. 1.00 for the remaining 10 years. This is done=  primarily through a debt reschedulement, granting liquidity relief in firs= t 3 years to MSEB and recovery through GOM bonds, and ROE reduction by conv= erting to 2 part tariff. Equity reduction by eliminating MSEB's equity in p= roject.=20  3. GOI agrees to backstop (purchase or credit support) 2 power blocks and G= OM/MSEB takes one.  [Note: I think we should ask for GOI to backstop all 3,=  but I think 2 is the most possible.]  4. GOI or GOM or Indian Financial Institutions (IFIs) (or combination there= of) takes enough equity at par to reduce Enron to 50%.  5. All additional funding requirements for the project, including additiona= l funds for development cost recovery, cost overruns for capital costs, wor= king capital, customs, commissioning fuel, etc. to be funded by additional = loans or equity to DPC from IFIs. This also includes any cost overruns due = to construction stoppage and delay we are currently facing. We should even = ask to eliminate existing Phase II sponsor Project Completion Support and r= eplace it with IFI loans. That last point may be a bit much since we have a= lready committed to this, but if the option is that we will walk from this = project, the IFIs with appropriate pressure from government could support t= his.  6. Negotiate to eliminate liquidity L/C obligation, LNG Supply L/C obligati= on and ship L/C obligation. If funding support is needed to cover these sho= rtfalls, it will come from IFIs.  Recall that this project has significant cashflow in later years, and the I= FI debt raised in #5 and 6 above could be repaid during that time.  7. All equity hold restrictions on Enron, GE and Bechtel are lifted, includ= ed those in project documents (for example, GOI guarantee and PPA) and loan=  documents. Enron's internal plans would be to exit after deal signed up.  8. MSEB to drop existing misdeclaration claims, and take steps in PPA to en= sure this is not an issue going forward.=20  There are many other items that can be included, including approvals from R= BI to recover all sponsors development costs, which would be funded by IFIs=  under #5 above, fuel hedging ability for MSEB, clearances for Metgas to ma= ximize value we can get in sale of the Metgas TARA, etc. Alternatively, we = could give Metgas contractual rights and existing permits and contracts to = GOI in exchange for their agreeing to items above. However, I wanted to foc= us on the bigger picture and have a discussion with management first on the=  concept before we put the extensive list together.  I know it's a wish list, but if parties (government, IFIs, other counterpar= ties) do not want this deal to terminate and equity to pull out and if they=  agree to points above, the sponsors would get the project done with limite= d additional funding by sponsors. This could be only transactional costs as= sociated with restructuring, which while significant, do not approach cost = of going forward as is. And it may include existing $233MM Project Completi= on Support, although we would negotiate hard to replace that with IFI debt = or equity.  We should still continue down PTN and Transfer Notice path, but we should a= lso consider how we give lenders and gov't some indication that we are stil= l adding value to the deal by showing some willingness to talk on changes t= o deal.=20  Wade",james.derrick@enron.com,rob.walls@enron.com,FW: Renegotiation thoughts,2001-05-10 11:54:45-07:00,received

I've tried to summarize most of what happened.  Mohan and I met early in morning with the lenders' observers to the meeting= , Mr. Kharkanis and Abhay Ahuja. Both are attorneys who work for the same l= awfirm, India Legal Advisors (previously affiliated with White & Case). Thi= s firm has represented Dabhol lenders in the past. Mr. Kharkanis is former = chief legal counsel at IDBI. Very pleasant meeting. Three points they made = -- (a) very difficult to resolve unless someone is willing to take all the = power, (b) this committee is probably not a proper committee to be renegoti= ating with as it is comprised of all Review Committee members, who are alre= ady biased in their conclusions, and (c) they asked about the misdeclaratio= n issue. I told them we felt we had a strong case and were willing to go al= l the way in arbitration or, assuming a big picture renegotiation could wor= k, resolve it in context of that renegotiation. But I pointed out a renegot= iation, while possible, was going to be difficult, and it would be an absol= ute non-starter unless GOI stood up and said they could take power.  At Renegotiation Committee (RC) meeting, only 3 of 9 members from their sid= e were present. Dr. Godbole, chair; Mr. Lal, Energy Secretary; and Ms. Bans= al, MSEB chair. Notably absent was any GOI representative. Their offered ra= tionale for this absence was that Mr. Gaukak (not Mr. Harish Salve as earli= er reported) had been appointed only last night and could not make it. It i= s clear to me that (a) GOI is still taking a hands-off approach and they de= layed appointment until late enough so they could not make meeting, and (b)=  GOI's commitment to finding workable solution is in question as they don't=  seem to be giving this any type of serious consideration based on who they=  appoint (Mr. Gaukak is former secretary in Telecom Dept.).  The press was allowed in at the beginning of the meeting only to take photo= s. They left and the meeting began. We agreed after the meeting that neithe= r party would discuss with the press about the meeting. As we left, we were=  absolutely mobbed and we ""no commented"" our way through the mob and left. = The mob was quite large and the walking space was small and going downstair= s, so there were a couple of reporters who tripped and fell and dropped cam= eras. Hopefully, the headlines will not read ""Enron stomps Journalist.""  The meeting lasted almost 2 hours. The RC opened up by saying their positio= n was on the table through the Godbole Committee Report and wanted us to re= spond. I read from my prepared notes, and told them we were open minded, wi= lling to listen but we had serious constraints. My key points from my notes=  were (a) who was going to buy the power from this 2184MW baseload plant th= at had to operate at high PLF for it to be economical, (b) our project was = out of money and would probably have to shut down absent further funding fr= om lenders, which depended on favorable gov't response to lender letter (th= is did not seem to bother them at all), (c) the main problem was their fail= ure I told them I felt it was major issue that GOI was not present and not = engaging in this dialogue. I said the absence of GOI meant that very little=  would be accomplished today as the key to any solution involved GOI involv= ement, and we needed to know what GOI's position was. The RC responded by s= aying they were disappointed that we did not have representatives from shar= eholders, lenders (and they objected here to the lenders' observer role ver= sus an active participant role), fuel suppliers and others here and they di= d not know whether to interpret that as lack of seriousness/commitment or n= ot.  The most disturbing thing to me was the Dr. Godbole was very clear, to the = point of stating this and repeating it again, that the original project was=  a mistake and DPC should pay for that mistake. He said that DPC proposed a=  2000 MW LNG facility with high PLF, and thus now that such a project is no= t working, it is DPC's fault (his rationale being that without DPC proposin= g the idea originally, it never would have come about) and we should pay. W= hen I asked him what tariff he thought should be appropriate, he quoted fro= m the Godbole Committee report -- the lowest tariff available to any gas-ba= sed plant in the country, with no ToP. Since the whole LNG idea was DPC's, = we should bear 100% of any LNG costs except for a reasonable per MMbtu pric= e that MSEB would pay as if they had a natural gas pipeline running already=  in place and running by their plant. Yes, folks, it was that ludicrous.  It's clear that among the 3 people there, Dr. Godbole was the firmest in hi= s extreme positions. And he is firm in those positions. Mr. Lal and Mr. Ban= sal were more conciliatory and trying to find some middle ground, although = since they only represent MSEB/GOM, their ability to do this is limited to = only one power block, and even on that, they are looking for tariff relief = and ToP relief beyond our ability to handle. But they are trying to move to=  the middle, whereas the chairman is not.  Even in absence of GOI, we talked at length about the fact that they had to=  play a role. The RC said they were not sure if GOI was willing to play a r= ole other than counter-guarantor, and even if they were, the GOI could not = be expected to pay more than a ""market"" price -- whatever a SEB in India is=  willing to pay. Currently, that ranges around Rs. 2.50. It is clear that D= r. Godbole feels no responsibility whatsoever for 2 power blocks, and he th= inks DPC should take responsibility, including convincing GOI to buy some a= mount of this at the ""market"" price. On this market price issue, I made it = clear that it was not our problem that the market price in India was an unr= ealistically low price influenced by subsidies, lack of tariff rationalizat= ion, etc. and we would not be able to meet their demands. We discussed the = need for having a creditworthy buyer for power from DPC at 90% PLF, before = we could talk any tariff relief, and even then, tariff relief expectations = had to be reasonable (not the 30% they are asking for but less than 10%).= =20  LNG terminal separation from power plant: They asked if an LNG terminal spl= it was possible, and we asked what did they think that would get them. They=  said tariff relief and absence of ToP. We pointed out tariff relief had be= en given in 1995 renegotiations when LNG terminal had been originally split= , and even when the terminal was included added back, the tariff relief had=  remained to MSEB's favor. We stated that the ToP would remain with the ult= imate customer, even if the terminal was split. They said why should the po= wer plant pay for all excess capacity in LNG terminal and we reminded them = again that the LNG terminal capacity was built solely for the power station=  as MSEB had required, and that 2 separate independent consultants had conf= irmed this.  RC asked for various proposals on what our tariff would be at various PLFs,=  assuming a certain reduced % tariff. We told them that since the project o= nly made sense at a high (90%) PLF, the key was for them and GOI to identif= y buyers for 90%, and then tariff is known.  Conclusion: they wanted to meet again and have a further discussion. We agr= eed to meet on May 23, but agreed that in interim, we had to know what the = role of the GOI was. We agreed that we would both go back and think about w= hat had been said and see if solutions were there, but we said that key was=  where were the buyers for this power.",james.derrick@enron.com,rob.walls@enron.com,FW: Friday Renegotiation Committee meeting and other events,2001-05-11 06:31:18-07:00,received
"  fyi   -----Original Message----- From:  Cline, Wade   Sent: Sunday, May 13, 2001 2:02 PM To: McDonald, Rebecca; Hughes, James A.; Walls Jr., Rob; Lundstrom, Bruce; Ben Glisan@ECT; Dutt, Ranabir; McGregor, Neil Subject: Weekend Update/Next Week Thoughts  Here is an update plus my thoughts on what we should consider this week. I hope to be able to discuss this on Monday's call. As this involves some press updates and thoughts regarding the lenders, I am sending this to Ben and Ranabir as well..  I. Press Reports in Weekend Newspapers after Friday Renegotiating Meeting -- reports were mixed on Renegotiation Meeting and possibility of success to find a solution.   More Credible papers: Times of India: DPC Phase II should be scrapped, panel tells Enron Economic Times: Enron panel meet fails to make breakthrough; State weighs termination notice to DPC  Other papers who follow DPC closely: Financial Express: DPC to meet panel on May 23; Renegotiation is only way out for DPC; Cut in tariff likely Business Standard: Dabhol not averse to tariff renegotiation  So the press is all over the map on the outcome of Friday's meeting.   II. Press reports from Delhi with GOI reaction:  Summary: GOI hopeful that solution can be found between DPC and GOM BUT: GOI makes clear in Sunday papers the GOI position: While GOI not opposed to allowing DPC power sale to 3rd parties, neither GOI nor NTPC will purchase power from DPC.   III. MESSAGE TO LENDERS:  Lenders want to know we are serious about finding solutions. We are, and are willing to engage in dialogue so long as willing buyers of power are at table. This was made clear in Friday's meeting. But Renegotiating Committee is not serious about realistic solutions. Evidence of this is Chairman's view that DPC (and thus its lenders and shareholders) should get no recovery for the LNG infrastructure. Rather, he strongly believes tariff should be (as reported in Godbole Committee Report) the lowest of any gas-based power plant in country, including those few with pipeline gas. Second, GOI is not serious yet, as they did not even bother to send someone to meeting.    IV. STEPS FORWARD (for consideration)  A. Issue PTN (whether to do it with or without Transfer Notice to be discussed separately on Monday)  B. When PTN issued, press statement to be issued to cover -- after several months of meetings and proposals, no serious response by MSEB, GOM and GOI parties are still not meeting their contractual obligations, even after both Indian and int'l lenders have written to GOI thus we are taking steps to protect contractual rights by issuing PTN Regarding future meetings to discuss project:  project was designed as baseload to meet MSEB requirements and approved by GOM and GOI; project must have buyers for power to have serious negotiations Renegotiating Committee position, which is reiteration of Godbole Committee report, is unrealistic  If MSEB, GOM and GOI are not willing to meet their contractual obligations to offtake power, then not feasible to discuss any changes to deal; thus prior to any further meetings, DPC awaits specific proposal from MSEB/GOM/GOI on who they propose to substitute for MSEB as the party who is contractually obligated to purchase the power from DPC the prior point is important in that we need to (a) set the going forward agenda with respect to any further meetings and (b) manage expectations regarding such future meetings and who will deliver what proposals, if any (not us).  C. Bring in senior management ASAP after PTN Rationale is to both feed our ideas into the GOI as well let lenders know we are committed to finding solution, including bringing our senior management to India for meetings I recommend we bring Ken Lay with Rebecca to meet in Delhi with Prime Minister, Finance Minister and Power Minister, along with Sonia Gandhi. Other meetings can be scheduled as well, and we will want to include some add'l meetings in Delhi and Mumbai. But above are the key meetings. Key message to be delivered -- 2 [or 3] options face the project Terminate, and we are willing to go that route rather than have to invest significant additional money into a project in the India power sector that does not currently work Buyout of foreign debt and equity and allow an Indian solution to be found [Renegotiate on our terms, including GOI taking 2 power blocks and IFIs funding all additional project costs. My earlier e-mail on renegotiation possibilities might provide some ideas here.] The reason I mention this option here is that if we ever think we might have to table a renegotiation option, having Ken & Rebecca do it at the highest level is the way to go.  The solution, regardless of which of 3 options will be chosen, must be handled at the highest level, and I think it is now (right after PTN) or never to bring in Ken and Rebecca to see if the solution is there as well as let our lenders know we are seriously taking one more run to try and find a solution. After we bring in Ken and Rebecca, if the GOI still remains on the sidelines and does not step up, the Phase I lenders should realize we have done everything we can and give us the Transfer Notice approval. The quicker we bring in Ken and Rebecca, the quicker we should have the strongest argument for the Transfer Notice approval.  One logistical point: I do think it is very important to bring in Ken and Rebecca very quickly after the PTN is issued.  But we will need some advance time to set up these high level meetings as well as get Indian approvals to bring Ken's plane into India. This will take about a full business week, so I think we should schedule this trip as soon as we can -- perhaps during week of May 21.   D. At same time as senior management comes in, have senior contacts from Wash. DC contact political leaders in Delhi to request a solution be found quickly to avoid any implications on improving India/US relations  E. Finally, I also think it is time for Enron to strongly consider an approach directly to some possible buyers. There are 2 Indian corporates who would be leading candidates. There are also some international majors that would be possible. Enron could consider a joint asset package of: DPC Metgas (the TARA is the real value here) Depending on the appropriate Enron internal approvals, 2 other assets could be considered Offshore oil & gas assets Data center  On the last 2 items, I know that one of the Indian corporates would be interested in the oil & gas assets, and both would be interested in the data center.  We could arrange meetings with senior management of potential purchasers when Ken & Rebecca are in India (or, to avoid press, we might want to schedule these either in low-key India locations or even outside India (Dubai or Singapore)).  We can discuss these thoughts on Monday. Wade",james.derrick@enron.com,rob.walls@enron.com,FW: Weekend Update/Next Week Thoughts,2001-05-14 06:53:44-07:00,received

"Jim,  As you might recall, we discussed hiring an Indiana law firm in connection  with a coal delivery dispute involving Enron and NIPSCO, an Indiana utility.  The case will end up tried in Indiana and is governed by Indiana law. Wayne  Gresham, who works for the coal group and happens to have practiced in  Indiana, suggested that we use a litigator named Dan Kelley.  Dan works at  Wayne's former firm, Ice, Miller, Donadio & Ryan.  Dan's conflicts check revealed that Ice, Miller represents the Simon  Property Group in various contract negotiations involving EES.  Apparently,  Simon is a long standing client of Ice Miller and has consented to Ice  Miller's representation of Enron in the NIPSCO dispute as long as, in the  event a dispute arises between Simon and Enron,  Enron will consent to the  simultaneous adverse representation of Ice Miller or agrees to allow Ice  Miller to withdraw from representing Enron to represent Simon.  Dan has no  personal involvement with Simon and is unaware of any potential dispute  between Enron and Simon.  So far, Dan seems like a very competent lawyer who has been not only  responsive to requests for quick turn around but also has shown a lot of  ""coal savvy"" which will be quite helpful to us. To the extent that we don't  have any other connections in Indiana and I hope we won't be having any other  litigation there, I don't see an immediate problem with the requested waiver.  I ran this by Richard who was OK with it as well.  Please let me know if you  are OK with this. I've copied Vicki Sharp on this note so that she can let us  know if she is aware of anything between Enron and Simon that might be  looming on the horizon.  Thanks in advance.

A letter will come out of Lord Mustill's Clerk confirming his acceptance of the appointment. That will probably appear from London tommorrow.  The next round of conversations to be undertaken by Andrew Roger QC will be with Mr Justice Pendse in relation to the arbitration between DPC and the MSEB.  I attach Lord Mustill's curriculum vitae. Although Mustill is a busy man,I think that his appointment is to be welcomed. Mustill was and is a commercial lawyer to his fingertips. At the bar his practice was one involving applied contract law (dry shipping,commodities,insurance,reinsurance and banking,very much a traditional Commercial Court practice). Along with Stewart Boyd QC he wrote the standard text on the law of arbitration. Mustill's reputation as a judge and an arbitrator is a strong one. His only drawback is that he is popular arbitrator in London,and,for that reason,he is busy.  Can I ask that you circulate Lord Mustill's curriculum vitae to whoever ought to receive it within the sponsors' group         _____________________________________________________________  This e-mail is sent by or on behalf of Linklaters, 10/F Alexandra House, Chater Road, Hong Kong.

With that said, it is probably not necessary to undertake this effort for  mid-year PRC purposes since we are probably moving to a three peer stucture where that split could be achieved (for year-end purposes where the compensation impact would be felt). If we stay with the four group stucture, I intend to push hard for the remapping of Gov't Affairs by year-end.     On a completely seperate issue, I continue to be  very concerned about the impact of the ""preferred"" distribution  relative to the bottom category for "" commercial support"" groups(I'm not implying this is'nt an issue for commercial groups- I just don't have the same ability to assess the impact there)....the concern, simply stated,  is that  it may be entirely  counterproductive to force individuals who are not performance problems  into a category that has significant implications for their careers here at Enron, particularly after going thru the past year where many of the non-performers in my group and others  were moved out of the company- the replacement costs for moving good performers out of the company for the sake of a ""preferred"" distribution are quite high...and that is even before you begin  to assess the incalcuable damage to morale that will invariably occour.

This mapping is intended to illustrate from a functional view point where each activity was placed at Year End 2000 VP PRC.  We were considering moving to a 3 Peer Group Structure however it as agreed at the last PRC Committee Meeting  to stay with the current structure since the data had been cleaned and everyone felt generally comfortable where most activities had been placed with the exception of just  2 or 3. It was agreed that we should concentrate on resolving these rather than undertaking an organization wide remapping excercise to consolidate to 3 Peer Groups. All functions/activities within the business units should now be reflected on the acttached.   The actions points from this excercise are:  1 to review and agree the attached mapping   2    consider and comment on highlighted groups that we have discussed in previous PRC meetings and ask for your comments or objections to moving them  as indicated on the attachment.  3 invite your comments or questions on any other function that you consider questionable or requiring further explanation.        Please return your comments to David Oxley by Friday May 25.        To have this discussion now will save lengthy discussions in the final VP/MD PRC Meetings.

We had a great group of people working on the CLE committee this year.  The committee was a combination of people identified by the various general counsels, plus people I knew and thought would be reliable volunteers.  I believe that one of the current committee members would be a logical choice to chair next year's law conference CLE program.  (I know that I would have felt a little more confident had I sat on the committee before taking the helm).  Although most of the committee members contributed to the effort, any of  the following lawyers would be strong candidates to chair next year's CLE committee:  Carlos Sole, Rose Engeldorf, Michelle Hicks, Susan Scott, Marianne Castano, Brenda Funk, or Kriste Sullivan.  David Koogler, who was not an active member of the committee, but nonetheless was responsible for a speaker, also would be a good choice (in fact, for some reason, EBS is under the impression that it is next on the list, so David and Michelle would not be surprised if they were tapped for the job -- co-chairs may be a good idea).  Let me know if you have any questions or would like any more information on the committee or other aspects of the law conference CLE program.  As I mentioned in my voice mail, I enjoyed chairing the committee and thank you for the opportunity.

I understand you are already aware of the above as a copy of the EEOC charge was provided to you by Ms. Michelle Hoogendam Cash, and as Mr. Bouillion wrote to you regarding same on May 10, 2001 when he first learned about it from Ms. Cash.  Mr. Bouillion has consulted with our broker, and it is their recommendation that we formally place our carrier on ""notice"" of a ""potential claim"" situation as a ""precautionary measure"" to ensure that the reporting provisions of the insurance contract are met.  While the charge itself does not give rise to a ""claim"" under the policy, the broker feels that matters which involve the EEOC generally result in formal claims being pursued.  Thus, their recommendation to report to the carrier.  Please advise if you would like for us to formally report this matter to the broker so that they can notice our carrier.  If so, please let us know whether you want us to disclose to Ms. Cash the potential for insurance coverage in the event a claim(s) result from the allegations.

Satellite Fax 1-801-8817999 E-mail: douglas-akin@onebox.com E-mail: jane_Williams@eudoramail.com  Dear Sir,  Re: Request for urgent mutual business Transaction  It is a pleasure to introduce myself to you. I am Mr. Douglas Akin, an Accountant by profession with the Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation and a member of the Presidential (Petroleum) Task Force Committee set by the present democratic Government in Nigeria, to supervise the sales and award of Crude Oil contracts through the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC).  The Chairman with the entire members of this committee have concluded every arrangement and now agreed to transfer out of the country a total sum of $85, 500,000.00 (Eighty five million and Five Hundred Thousand Dollars Only) to a reliable corporate or private account oversea for mutual disbursement, hence my reason to contact you. This amount is the excess sum realized from sales of Crude Oil above the government regulated price margin as a result of price fluctuation, which we never rendered accurate sales figures to the government for reasons you now know.  Benefits: At the successful conclusion of this business, your good self shall be entitled to 20% of the total sum remitted into your account for your collaboration, 5% shall be set aside to defray all expenses incurred during the transaction by both parties and the balance of US$75% for the committee. If you are interested in this business as I hope you will, please contact me urgently at any of  the above e-mail address or fax number, quoting our existing secret code of this business, as Black & White, then, I will revert back to you with detailed information.  Note: When dialing our fax, you do not need to add our country code of 234. Just dial your international access code, then followed by   our fax number. If you are in Canada or USA, and outside the area code of 801, then omit 1 but add the 801. You may equally e-mail us at the above e-mail address.  Yours sincerely, Signed: MR.

A total of 1,468 Liberal Arts students received their diplomas.  In a few days, you will be able to experience the ceremony vicariously by reading the remarks of History Commencement speaker, Admiral Bob Inman, which you will be able to access at http://www.utexas.edu/cola/news/releases/index.html.  As students enroll in their courses for next year, the prevailing wisdom seems to be that taking fewer hours will yield higher grades.  In fact, the opposite is true.  According to a three-year study by the Office of Admissions, students carrying 15-17 hours outperformed their classmates taking 12-13 hours.  Nevertheless, the portion of students attempting 14-17 hours is decreasing (from 47.7% in 1996 to about 39% in 1999). The correlation between 15-17 hour course load and a higher GPA was true in all racial/ethnic groups and despite differences in academic ability as measured by the SAT/ACT tests.  This is important information and you can help by disseminating it widely - especially to current and incoming students.  The University could serve many more students if students moved through their college program in a shorter time.  College costs would diminish and earning capacity would increase.  I have just returned from a wonderful visit to Midland, where Advisory Council Vice-Chair Brian McLaughlin made sure I saw all that his hometown has to offer.  We talked with prospective students at the Trinity School and at Midland High School and Lee High School, had lunch with fellow Advisory Council member Cadell Liedtke, and even visited the Haley Library.  Successes abound:  S. Gail Caldwell, American Studies MA and BA alumna, was just awarded a Pulitzer Prize in the area of Distinguished Criticism for her ""insightful observations on contemporary life and literature"" in The Boston Globe.  A cash award of $7,500 accompanies the prize. Congratulations!  A trumpet fanfare, a classroom takeover, and a Texas-size check -- the annual surprise Friar Centennial Teaching Fellowship goes to our own Associate Dean Larry Carver.  The Friar Society is UT Austin's oldest and most respected honor society, seeking to recognize professors who reach out to undergraduate students in ways that exemplify true dedication.  Carver was chosen because ""he reaches students in his classroom through his tireless efforts to ensure that material is accessible, interesting and relevant.  He challenges students to revel in great books.""  With the award comes a check for $12,000. . . which comes with the condition that the professor cancel class upon receipt of the check.  Larry assures me that some of the award will be used to increase the Pinto Carver Scholarship, the only endowment at the University named for a cat.   See longer story with pictures at http://www.utexas.edu/cola/news/releases/carver.html.  Philosophy professor Alex Mourelatos has been inducted into the Academy of Athens, which cited his role in creating at UT a model program, the joint classics/philosophy graduate program in ancient philosophy which was launched in 1967.  This is the highest honor bestowed in Greece on scientists and scholars in the fine arts and letters.  As students prepare for a summer in Winedale learning Shakespeare in the most hands-on way possible, a new steering committee has been formed to raise endowment funds to support this program in perpetuity.  Members are Mike & Penny Cies, Greg & Brenda Hemphill, Royce & Elva Keilers, J. Mark Metts, Dick and Judy Perkins, Ernie & Mary Gayle Stromberger, Eric & Laura Thomas, Peyton & Carolyn Townsend, and Barbara & Milt Williams, who will host the group's meeting at their restored home in Winedale early in June.   Contact Clare Hudspeth at (512) 471-8861 if you want to help or make a gift.  For those of you lucky enough to have been taught Shakespeare by James B. Ayres, Ph.D., Shakespeare at Winedale Regents Professor, you might want to send him a note of congratulations - ""Doc"" was just elected to the Academy of Distinguished Teachers at the University of Texas.  The academy, which totals only 70 members, is intended to recognize and enhance teaching, especially at the undergraduate level.  Others from Liberal Arts receiving this high honor are Mia E. Carter, Ph.D., Associate Professor in English, and Robert D. King, Ph.D., the Audre and Bernard Rapoport Regents Chair of Jewish Studies, Department of Linguistics.  Provost Sheldon Ekland-Olson described these as ""extraordinary teachers.""  He went on to say, ""Being selected is a clear expression of the high regard colleagues hold for the new members' dedication and contributions to teaching and to our students' intellectual development.""  As we talk about great teaching, I'd like to call your attention to an exciting and important new program here in the College:  UTeach Liberal Arts, which works with 65 students throughout their undergraduate years as they pursue majors in English, Spanish, and the social sciences and get hands-on experience learning to teach in local classrooms at the same time.  You'll find an interesting article about this program at http://www.utexas.edu/cola/alumni/initiatives/uteach.html.  Your responses to the questionnaire in the last newsletter were really heartwarming, with many expressions of appreciation and affirmation. The great majority wants us to keep the length and frequency of the mailing as they are and to continue with the same content.  Some great suggestions came as well: a request for reading lists, more info about alumni achievements, stories about ""average"" students; and even ideas on ""what alumni can do to be of assistance.""  In closing, let me pose another question: What do you consider the greatest way in which a liberal arts education has enriched your life? Send me a line or two on this topic and we may use some of your answers in our outreach to students.  Thanks for this and for all you do for the College.  Have a happy and healthy summer! --  Richard W. Lariviere Dean College of Liberal Arts The University of Texas at Austin http://www.utexas.edu/cola/   P.S.

" Please read this.  Thanks.   -----Original Message----- From:  Lundstrom, Bruce   Sent: Wednesday, May 30, 2001 10:20 AM To: Walls Jr., Rob Subject: Indian Counsel  Rob -  I'd really like to take this up today with you.  Bruce  ---------------------- Forwarded by Bruce Lundstrom/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT on 05/30/2001 10:20 AM ---------------------------    Paul Kraske 05/30/2001 08:09 AM To: Bruce Lundstrom/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT cc:    Subject: Indian Counsel  Bruce-  I think Wade spoke to you last night about some concerns I have with our Indian litigation team.  Principally I am a bit disappointed with Atul Setalvad.  You and I have discussed this a little in the past and I've shared some of my frustrations.  Ultimately, and notwithstanding my grumbling to you and Gail, I would be willing to put up with arrogance, over-billing, criticism of Enron and the project and even (grudgingly) the disrespect with which he treats me and the other DPC lawyers if I thought he could get the job done.  But I don't think he can.   He may still have some good ideas.  And he does have history with the project.  But he's slow.  And he's unresponsive to our schedule, our priorities and our instructions.  One reason we had to ask for more time from the MERC is that he simply wasn't prepared to argue yesterday.  I'm still not sure he's read MSEB's petition and I'm quite sure he has no idea what the substantive argument about misdeclaration is.  Under the glare of TV cameras and under pressure at yesterday's MERC hearing, I thought he choked.  In contrast, MSEB's advocate spoke persuasively about the PPA and the MERC.  I figure if he could get up to speed on the PPA and on misdeclaration, we can bring someone else up to speed as well.  We shouldn't be hiring the best lawyers in the UK and the States and then settling for the ""B"" team in India especially when MSEB has collected three of the best lawyers from  Delhi and Bombay.    I'm not looking to totally dump the guy.  Even from a prudence perspective, we should have more than one senior lawyer ready to go.  If  we are going to be waging court wars on multiple fronts and on different issues, it would be irresponsible to stick with only one counsel.  We've identified three guys to approach and I think we should get them all up to speed and involved going forward.  When we need to deploy someone in a particular matter, we can choose among the three of them (and Atul S) and pick the individual most likely to be successful.    1. I'm meeting with P. Chidambaram here in Bombay  today.  He's opined for us on the misdeclaration issue in the past.  Very smart guy.  Former Finance Minister of India.  Well respected and someone I definitely want on our team.    2. We've also approached Ashok Desai in the past.  Former Attorney General of India and the mentor of MSEB's lawyer (the Advocate General of Maharashtra who appeared at the MERC yesterday).  Walker thought Desai would be particularly useful given the possible effect on MSEB's lawyer of having to argue against his former boss. We're not sure he's still available but I intend to find that out. I understand he is out of the country at the moment.  But we want to approach him in Early July when he gets back.    3. Last guy is a fellow named Parasaran.  Reputed to be one of the two best lawyers in India (the number one guy - Fali Nariman - is already working against us).  We have not spoken to him yet.  He may already have accepted a brief from MSEB, GOM or GOI.   If not, we will try to approach him.   Finally, although less urgently, I think we need more litigation support.  Shoban is terribly smart and has the same depth of experience of Atul R. and Atul S.  But he's ill equipped to support the fight we're undertaking.  He has no associates.  He has no secretaries.  He can't research case law.  He's only available from 10 - 6.  When we need to prepare submissions to court, inevitably he calls us up and sheepishly asks whether we can do it ourselves.  Which we've stayed here late at night in the past and done.  But I'm not sure we can handle procedural litigation support on top of everything else we're doing.    Again, I'm not proposing we replace him.  And I'm not even sure we have a firm in mind to help out with this stuff right at the moment (we're considering 1.  Desai & Diwanji, 2. Amarchand and 3. A firm called Doijode & Phartephekar).  But I do think we're going to need a firm to back us up with junior associates willing to pull cases and crunch out filings 24 hours a day.  Again, no point in putting together a crack legal team from the States and England when we can't deliver the goods here in Bombay.    I realize the risk of suggesting new players.  If we tank, the first thing Jim and Rob will ask is ""Why did we ever change from Setalvad?  Who are these new guys?""  quickly followed by ""Paul Kraske has left Enron to pursue other interests"".  But I would be remiss not to bring my reservations to your attention and to strongly suggest that we add more guys to the team.  I'm also willing to have this discussion with Rob and, if necessary, with Jim.  Atul R. is still preparing the writ petition but I want to act a little quickly on the Senior Counsel front so we can line up either Ashok Desai or Chidambaram to argue the writ before the High Court.

"Mr. Derrick, I am directing this email to your attention at the request of Mr. Jim Bouillion for consideration of extending coverage to Enron Corp., pursuant to the EMPLOYMENT PRACTICES LIABILITY ENDORSEMENT on our Directors & Officers policy.  We have received a new Petition wherein a former employee of Enron Corp.

Suit is filed in Harris County, Texas, with an Answer date of June 18, 2001.  Essentially, the Plaintiff claims to have been harassed by Ken Griebling in such a way that he created a ""hostile work environment"".  She filed a complaint with HR and Ken Rice, to no avail.  She was later advised her position was being eliminated and that her responsibilities were being assigned to Ken Burroughs, who she had hired and trained.  She was in turn assigned to a bandwidth trading floor position with no defined responsibilities wherein she was terminated shortly thereafter under the alleged pretext that her position had been eliminated.  Our preliminary review of the Plaintiff's Original Petition (absent any independent investigation or knowledge with respect to her allegations and the valued placed on same-pleadings allege an unspecified amount of damages) suggests there might be coverage for this loss under the Directors & Officers policy.  The definition of ""WRONGFUL EMPLOYMENT PRACTICE"" includes ""discrimination"" which is defined as both the termination of an employee and the treatment of an employee in disparate manner from other similarly-situated employees in respect to a employee's sex, or in violation of any equivalent protection or rights which may have been conferred on any group or individual protecting them against employment discrimination under federal, state, or local law.  Please advise if you would like for us to extent coverage to the named defendant, Enron Corp.  According to the information provided, the matter has been assigned to C. Robert Vote of the Litigation Unit.  Thanks,  Rob Cole, Manager-Claims ENA - Global Risk Markets P.O.

This is the procedural means by which the High Court controls and supervises the activities of lower Courts and administrative tribunals. It is,strictly,a public law proceeding rather than a private law proceeding. Again,strictly,we cannot use a Writ Petition as a means of asserting a right to have these proceedings stayed under section 45 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act 1996. That is a private law application. We could only get that inot the High Court by first making that application to the MERC,having it refused and then proceeding by way of statutory appeal. Clearly,a stay application presumes that the MERC has jurisdiction.  (2) The way to tackle the injunction is to apply to have it discharged or modified. If (perhaps when) MERC says no,there is a statutory right of appeal to the High Court.  (3) The Writ Petition is an all or nothing excercise. Realistically,if DPC succeeds in the Writ Petition,the MERC is dead and so (ultimately) will be the MSEB. I think that I can fairly safely predict that in front of any half-decent tribunal in London,the recission claim is going to go nowhere. If,however,DPC does not succeed on jurisdiction,I cannot see a stay application succeeding in front of the MERC. If the Court says that the MERC has jurisdiction,you can bet your bottom dollar on the fact that it will be excercised. No doubt DPC could file a statutory appeal to the High Court (against a refusal to grant a stay),but that will take a very long time to get heard in these circumstances.  (4) The prcedural stroke which requires to be played right in the High Court is getting the Court to deal with this Writ Petition urgently. Should that occur,we should get home sooner rather than later (working on Indian time,that is). If,contrary to my expectation,the Court sits on the matter,then we are in difficulties. It is going to be hard to appeal when the decision is that there is no decision.  (5) I do not think that DPC can prudently disregard the MERC's order. Aside from the invocation of contempt procedures against DPC,the MSEB would simply apply to the High Court for an injunction directly. Also,will our Lenders really allow DPC to serve a Termination Notice in these circumstances (given that the Phase I dollar Lenders require to get to the GOI Guarantee)? I personally doubt it. As a practical matter I believe that we have to comply with the MERC's orders unless and until the High Court says that MERC has no jurisdiction. The more practical approach is this. Having filed our Writ Petition,nothing prevents us from applying to MERC to vary its current order. If it refuses,we file a stautory appeal against its order and apply to the Chief Justice to have both matters conjoined. That is what we ought to be doing.  (6) I do not know enough about our PRI coverage (certainly the OPIC cover) to say with certainty. However,the Lloyd's Policy has the better coverage (subject to whatever right the underwriters may have to avoid for non-disclosure on placing). That policy requires that DPC obtains an arbitral award. I think that we should be doing all that we can to preserve the position viz-a-viz that policy. This seems to dictate that we comply with the MERC's orders,at least for the time being. One remedy for contempt by a corporate body is the appointment of a receiver. The implications of that for obtaining any arbitral award are obvious.  -----Original Message----- From: Jim Mccartney [mailto:jw1000mac@yahoo.com] Sent: 31 May 2001 06:46 To: christopher.walker@linklaters.com Cc: bruce.lundstrom@enron.com Subject: dpc   chris, is there any established procedure under indian procedural or substantive law on how we challenge the merc injunction? if we lose before the bombay high court, e.g. they decline to consider the matter or just sit on it, what then? appeal to the s.ct., mandamus? since we would have to rely on the indian courts to enforce an arbitration award (as i recall) what good would it do to disregard the merc's order (and the court's) and proceed with the arbitration-- a high risk venture--could it help us with our political risk coverage or other extra-india protections? we would appreciate your thoughts. best regards, jim  __________________________________________________ Do You Yahoo!?

As you may imagine things are starting to get a little fraught. I assume that someone has supplied you with a copy of the MSEB's Peition to MERC (the main text and pleading is 56 pages only,the rest consisting of exhibits).  My points in reply as follows:-  (1) The MSEB's claim for recission is,in my humble opinion,utterly hopeless for the following reasons:-  (a) The MSEB has know that the Power Station could not do the required ramp-up in a cold start for nearly 2 years during which time performance (of a sort) has been tendered by the MSEB. The MSEB affirmed the contract many months ago.  (b) The Lenders took rights in security over the PPA bona fide and for value. That,as a matter of settled law,bars recission.  (c) I do not believe that there was any ""representation"" as such.  (2) The Dynamic Parameters of the Plant form the exhibits to the PPA. If they are anything,they are warranties or promises,not representations. The classical definition of a warranty in English law is a pre-contractual representation which has been reduced to writing and inserted into the resulting contract. As such,it takes effect as a promise.  (3) I think that the MERC Petition in fact tells one how the MSEB is putting its case on misrepresentation. Effectively,it is saying that DPC put forward a draft contract with the Dynamic Parameters in it,and we relied upon them; they induced us to enter into the contract. That is a bit of a summary,but it is roughly their case. The advantage to DPC of the MERC Petition (if DPC is ever allowed to arbitrate) is that we know what he MSEB's defence is going to be before we even plead out Statement of Claim.  (4) What you are describing is a request for further and better particulars of the MSEB's pleading. Standing the fact that DPC is challenging the jurisdiction of MERC,DPC cannot safely ask for anything in that proceeding. We can ask by letter. I doubt whether we would ever get a reply. What we may well get,however,is something further by way of filings made by the MSEB in the proposed Wirt Petition.  If you do not get a copy of the MSEB Petition filed with the MERC,please let me know.  -----Original Message----- From: Jim Mccartney [mailto:jw1000mac@yahoo.com] Sent: 31 May 2001 04:58 To: christopher.walker@linklaters.com Subject: dpc   chris, i would like to have your thoughts of this misrepresentation claim. i have not seen the mseb petition before the merc, which i hear (but do not believe) contains 700 pages. all i have seen is the very generalized ""you misrepresented"" statement in their letter. what would you think of asking in some appropriate correspondence-- what was/were the misrepresentation/s referred to, when were they made, who made them, to whom, were they in writing or oral (if in writing, what writings) etc. in other words pin them down. this is what we would do if confronted with a similar broad, general charge in a court proceeding. it might make the mseb think more and prepare better, but they may not have anything other than their interpretation of the ppa. please give me your direct line again. i have not had much luck calling the 24888 number. best regards, jim  __________________________________________________ Do You Yahoo!?

" your thoughts?   -----Original Message----- From:  Lundstrom, Bruce   Sent: Sunday, June 03, 2001 8:01 PM To: Walls Jr., Rob Subject: India -- Recent E-Mails re Inappropriate Activities  Rob -  I met with John Brindle on Friday to discuss the recent India e-mails.  Earlier, I talked with Bob Sparger, the HR person who is mentioned in one of the e-mails.    I've also now reviewed a series of e-mails from ""Anonymous"", ""Enron Wellwisher"" and ""Amit Patil"".  I can't find any allegations in these e-mails that Enron has misbehaved vis-a-vis the outside world -- all of the allegations seem to me to relate to breaches of internal policies, self-dealing, etc.  Accordingly, I don't see an FCPA hook in these e-mails.  I asked John and Bob and they confirm that they do not see an FCPA issue in these e-mails.  Let me know what role you think Legal should play.  I'd be happy to have HR take the lead in following-up on what are largely HR issues.  If you want us to be more assertive in this process, we can do that as well.  In an earlier e-mail, I thought that we might be able to get Paul or Robert to help out with these e-mails.  I just don't see that this is feasible at this point -- these guys are working non-stop at firefighting at present.  We could, however, get Lena or one of the other lawyers involved.  By the way, John's people will investigate how Anonymous is getting access to our e-mail system.

The    Indian banks are trying to induce the foreign banks to fund into a    project with a repudiated PPA.  It is becoming more apparent to us that    the Indian banks are being heavily influenced by the Government of India    and not acting as commercial institutions.  Our business people do not    believe that all or most foreign banks will continue funding at this    point.  It is likely that the Indian banks could act on their own to    cure the construction contract payments which give rise to termination    this month (about $34 million).  Within a few months, however, the    Indian bank facility would be fully funded.     Today, we filed our writ petition in the Bombay High Court challenging    MERC's jurisdiction.  While we have a hearing date scheduled on Monday,    there is some doubt whether or not we will get a hearing on that date.

"FYI   -----Original Message----- From:  Hughes, James A.   Sent: Thursday, June 07, 2001 4:08 PM To: Skilling, Jeff; Lay, Kenneth Cc: McDonald, Rebecca; Derrick Jr., James Subject: Quicksilver Resources Importance: High Sensitivity: Confidential  Ken and Jeff:  Glen Darden, the President and CEO of Quicksilver Resources, Inc., is a longtime personal and professional friend of mine.  Recently, he has asked whether I would consider serving as an outside Director on the Board of Directors of Quicksilver.  Before meeting with Glen to discuss this further, I want to make sure that Enron does not have any objections.  Headquartered in Fort Worth, Texas, Quicksilver is a natural gas and crude oil production company engaged in the development and acquisition of long-lived producing natural gas and oil properties. Quicksilver began trading publicly in March of 1999 on the American Stock Exchange (KWK).  Quicksilver has a long standing business relationship with Enron.  Enron has historically entered into pre-pays and hedging transactions related to natural gas production and continues to do so today.  Enron (via JEDI) also provided some financing at the time of the merger of Quicksilver and Mercury Exploration and was a significant shareholder of Quicksilver at the time of its initial public offering.  I believe JEDI has since divested this stockholding.  If I were to serve on the board of Quicksilver, I expect that there will be related party transactions of a routine ongoing nature that would need to be disclosed and which I would need to abstain from voting on as a member of the board.  However, I do not feel there would be any material conflicts of interest as Quicksilver's core business is complementary to Enron, not competitive with Enron.  As a personal matter, it is an experience that would be beneficial and would provide valuable personal visibility in our industry.  I am scheduled to meet with Glen and others at Quicksilver later this month to further discuss this possibility.  Would each of you please let me know after due consideration whether you have any objection to or concern with the position.  Please do not hesitate to call me (x67713) if you have any questions or wish to discuss this further.  Thanks.

"Jim:  Enron has been giving $10,000 annually to the Law & Organizational Economics Center for several years for their programs providing economic education to state judges.  I have been following the program and have been impressed by the quality of presentations and professors lecturing to state officials on such things as opportunity cost, cost/benefit analysis, and risk analysis.  Many of these judges have not had much training in economics.  Attached is a note from Henry Butler about moving his program from the University of Kansas to Chapman University, which was due to an additional financial support and a better location for operations.  A spreadsheet at the bottom shows the total number of state judges who have gone through his program since it began in the mid-1990s by state.  I have recommended to the Enron Foundation (Misha Siegel and Elyse Kalmans) that we renew the support in 2002.  You opinion might be asked as well, so I wanted to provide this to you.  If you have any questions, let me know.  - Rob  ----- Forwarded by Rob Bradley/Corp/Enron on 06/08/2001 04:49 PM -----    ""Butler, Henry N"" <hbutler@ukans.edu> 06/08/2001 02:58 PM     To: ""'Rob.Bradley@enron.com'"" <Rob.Bradley@enron.com>  cc: ""Butler, Paige V"" <pbutler@ku.edu>  Subject: RE: LOEC Update for 2002 Contribution     Rob:  I've attached two documents:  First, an Excel Spreadsheet listing the number of judicial participants by court and state. We do not ask the judges for their political affiliations. In many states, the judges are elected in ""nonpartisan"" elections -- of course, it is usually pretty clear who is what.  I imagine that there is a ""selection bias"" toward more conservative judges -- however, even if there is such a bias, our programs are still very valuable when in comes to making our civil justice system more predictable.  Even the pro-business judges need to understand how to articulate the economic reasoning that supports their pro-business instincts.  We provide them with the tools to be more effective.  Second, a generic description of Chapman from their P.R. office.  Rest assured, the church does not play a major role in the University.  Also, I wanted to mention to you a significant connection between Chapman University and Enron.  The most important player at Chapman is George L. Argyros.  George is Chairman of the Board of Trustees and a very loyal financial supporter of the University.  I will be Dean of the George L. Argyros School of Business and Economics.  George has been nominated by President Bush as Ambassador to Spain.  George Argyros is also Chairman Emeritus & Treasurer of the Horatio Alger Association.  Kenneth L. Lay is Executive Vice President of the Horatio Alger Association.  I suspect that Mr. Argyros and Mr. Lay have worked closely in their leadership capacities with the Horatio Alger Association.  I would hope that this connection would result in a much larger contribution to the Chapman LOEC.  Do you have any suggestions about how to proceed?

"Rob, thank you for the information.  Jim   -----Original Message----- From:  Bradley, Rob   Sent: Friday, June 08, 2001 4:59 PM To: Derrick Jr., James Subject: RE: LOEC Update for 2002 Contribution  Jim:  Enron has been giving $10,000 annually to the Law & Organizational Economics Center for several years for their programs providing economic education to state judges.  I have been following the program and have been impressed by the quality of presentations and professors lecturing to state officials on such things as opportunity cost, cost/benefit analysis, and risk analysis.  Many of these judges have not had much training in economics.  Attached is a note from Henry Butler about moving his program from the University of Kansas to Chapman University, which was due to an additional financial support and a better location for operations.  A spreadsheet at the bottom shows the total number of state judges who have gone through his program since it began in the mid-1990s by state.  I have recommended to the Enron Foundation (Misha Siegel and Elyse Kalmans) that we renew the support in 2002.  You opinion might be asked as well, so I wanted to provide this to you.  If you have any questions, let me know.  - Rob  ----- Forwarded by Rob Bradley/Corp/Enron on 06/08/2001 04:49 PM -----    ""Butler, Henry N"" <hbutler@ukans.edu> 06/08/2001 02:58 PM     To: ""'Rob.Bradley@enron.com'"" <Rob.Bradley@enron.com>  cc: ""Butler, Paige V"" <pbutler@ku.edu>  Subject: RE: LOEC Update for 2002 Contribution     Rob:  I've attached two documents:  First, an Excel Spreadsheet listing the number of judicial participants by court and state. We do not ask the judges for their political affiliations. In many states, the judges are elected in ""nonpartisan"" elections -- of course, it is usually pretty clear who is what.  I imagine that there is a ""selection bias"" toward more conservative judges -- however, even if there is such a bias, our programs are still very valuable when in comes to making our civil justice system more predictable.  Even the pro-business judges need to understand how to articulate the economic reasoning that supports their pro-business instincts.  We provide them with the tools to be more effective.  Second, a generic description of Chapman from their P.R. office.  Rest assured, the church does not play a major role in the University.  Also, I wanted to mention to you a significant connection between Chapman University and Enron.  The most important player at Chapman is George L. Argyros.  George is Chairman of the Board of Trustees and a very loyal financial supporter of the University.  I will be Dean of the George L. Argyros School of Business and Economics.  George has been nominated by President Bush as Ambassador to Spain.  George Argyros is also Chairman Emeritus & Treasurer of the Horatio Alger Association.  Kenneth L. Lay is Executive Vice President of the Horatio Alger Association.  I suspect that Mr. Argyros and Mr. Lay have worked closely in their leadership capacities with the Horatio Alger Association.  I would hope that this connection would result in a much larger contribution to the Chapman LOEC.  Do you have any suggestions about how to proceed?

Subject: Preparing for Legal Action against a retroactive DA suspension Importance: High   As of this point in time, the CPUC is NOT expected to vote tomorrow. The CPUC has not said when a new meeting would be held.  Although we continue to keep the pressure on, the CPUC vote could be for DA suspension as of July 1.  We need to be prepared to take immediate legal action in that event.  Here is the plan and what we'd like from customers.  Within a few hours of a CPUC vote, we plan to file at the CPUC for an emergency stay and request for rehearing. As part of that filing, we would need to include all of  the points we would raise in the court and declarations from each individual aggrieved party.   The decalarations would be held completely confidential by the attorney, transmitted directly through our outside attorney and would be filed under protective seal at the Commission.  The attorneys are preparing a pro-forma declaration that each party can use to prepare their own. I will e-mail that as soon as I have it. The draft court case is attached.  It will form the basis for our CPUC filing. We would expect the CPUC to ignore the filing.  If the Commission failed to act on our request by the next regularly scheduled meeting, we would file in court immediately. We would use the same declarations and much of the same filing info in the court case. To the extent we have customers on our filings, we have a much better shot at winning. I have gotten agreements form a number of other ESPs who will join with us.  They are: APSES, Strategic Energy, AES/New Energy, American Utility Network, and perhaps Commonwealth. Each of these, in turn, is working to get some of their customers to sign on. I am working with UC's attorney to see if they will join. Our strategy is similar if the Legislature enacts a law with a retroactive date.  The major differences are that we would go directly to court and we would have to wait until the bill was signed by the Governor. Some of our ESP and customer friends would likely drop off at that point, because they have less financial harm from an Aug 25 date. If you have customers intersted in signing on, please let me know.  The customer may contact me or the attorneys directly.

Jim -    It has been several years since  we've visited, and there are a couple of areas I'd like to update with you  on.  I'm hopeful, after reading the following, that you will feel it  is worthwhile for us to get together again.   First, my last litigation project at  Fulbright & Jaworski just came to a close very unexpectedly, due  to a third party stay order, and I am once again looking for new matters to work  on.  I have attached my updated resume for your reference, or to pass on to  others in your Law Department who might have needs for my type of skills on a  project basis.  At a current billing rate of $80 per hour, engaging me  (with a specialization in this field for over 11 years)  for basic document  production activity generally will produce a meaningful cost savings  vs. utilization of even the most junior, inexperienced associate in an  outside counsel firm for such tasks.  I think I've mentioned to you before  that I have particular expertise in dealing with productions of electronic  documents -- especially email in a variety of application formats.   Second --and more importantly -- I  have reflected several years about what my ideal job would be, if  I were to go to work again on a permanent basis.  This week, I finally  took time to draft out a general job description of that job.  I have  called it, for now, a ""Legal Information Counsel"" position within a corporate  law department.  My draft job description is also attached.      I believe a strong case can be made  to justify such a position in many large, diverse corporations with multiple  lines of business.  In a nutshell, that justification is twofold:  (1)  avoidance of repeated re-inventions of the wheel across an organization, as it  relates to the expensive process of handling documents and data generated  by complex litigation and other corporate legal matters;  and (2) taking a  proactive leadership approach to legally significant information in a  corporation, vs. constantly being in a reactive mode as new fires break  out.     I urge you to review both my resume,  and the Legal Information Counsel description attached, and then let me come in  to visit with you about them.  I am particularly interested in your  reaction and comments to the Legal Information Counsel concept, over and above  whether such a position might be an appropriate addition to the Enron Corporate  Law Department.     I appreciate your time, Jim, and  look forward to having the opportunity to visit with you again.

As of September 30, I will no longer be getting up and = driving downtown to work every day.  Much has happened in 2001, on personal= , family, professional, national, and global levels, which has induced me t= o act on my inclination to retire (I've been thinking about it ever since I=  got that solicitation from AARP).  There is much that I will miss (daily c= amaraderie with co-workers and colleagues, challenging work, interesting pr= ojects, a paycheck), but there are other things that I can do without (rush=  hour traffic, cumbersome regulations, long hours, irreconcilable conflicts= , office politics, tedious paperwork, seemingly endless meetings, payroll d= eductions).  On balance, it looks like a fair trade.=20         I have enjoyed the very good fortune of having a challenging and sa= tisfying career, and of having been able to do so in the company of many wo= nderful people.  I want to take this opportunity to thank everyone for your=  friendship and support over the years, for contributing to my never-ending=  education, and for being a valued part of my experiences and memories.  Th= ere have been a lot of good times, and some less good times, but I wouldn't=  want to start all over again and see how it turns out next time around.  I=  am enormously grateful for all of my many blessings, and hopefully the sam= e is true for you.  =20         My general plan for right now is to contemplate the future and my p= lace in it, which sound pretty good to me -- both the process of contemplat= ion as well as the future itself.  I do intend to find some arguably produc= tive and/or fun ways to spend my new otherwise idle time, and finding out w= hat those may be should be half the fun.  Perhaps the biggest concern is ho= w long Linda will be able to tolerate my not getting up and leaving the hou= se every weekday morning, but she's at the church a lot of the time anyway.=   I'm sure the boys are wondering how my being around the house more will a= ffect their tranquility and privacy, and that remains to be seen, although = I doubt that I'll be hanging out with them and their friends very much anyw= ay.=20         One of my specific resolutions as we go forward is to do a better j= ob of keeping up with friends.  The wonders of e-mail will facilitate that = endeavor, but I will also be available in person for lunches, happy hours, = tee times, dinners, movies, and other consultations. I already know where t= o find you; reciprocally, my contact information will now be tsheltont@aol.= com; 3507 Plumb, Houston, TX 77005; phone 713-665-5315; and fax 713-665-741= 0.

Chris Walker, local counsel, GE and Bechtel support filing the suit.  Other than Jim McCartney, the Enron representatives support filing the suit.  In the end, Jim McCartney defers to Chris Walker's judgment.  Filing suit in London has some risks.  We are uncertain of the response of the India Supreme Court, the GOM and the current GOM/DPC arbitration panel. The Supreme Court may take offense to the filing (although Chris thinks that this risk is small).  In a perverse way, our filing in London could further induce GOM to file in India (although we believe that they will in any event).  The current arbitration panel may use this as an opportunity to wait until the underlying DPC/MSEB dispute is decided (although Chris doubts it).  My understanding is that Enron commercial supports the filing of the suit. It is scheduled to be filed on Friday. If any of you would like to revisit the issue before Friday, please let me know.

Walter Russell Mead, Senior Fellow for U.S. Foreign Policy at the Council on Foreign Relations, will lead the discussion and Norman B. Frankel, Physician at the Medical Clinic of Houston, will chair and host.  The dinner will take place on Thursday, October 11, from 6:30 to 9:00 p.m. at the River Oaks Country Club, located on 1600 River Oaks Boulevard.  In light of the September 11 terrorist attacks, the Bush administration is faced with the unique challenge of building a national consensus for what could be the longest, most complex, and most difficult war in American history.  Walter Russell Mead will discuss how America's foreign policy tradition, defense culture, and diplomatic history will influence President Bush and America in responding to the terrorist threat.  Walter has just completed a study of the history of U.S. foreign policy at the Council on Foreign Relations and written a book, Special Providence, due to be published by Knopf in November.

Som= e of the changes took effect immediately (e.g. additional security personne= l) and some are phasing in.  While not all of the changes will be visible, = there are a few that will have an impact on everyday activities.  In all th= e steps we take and recommendations we make, we will be making our faciliti= es and systems more secure and endeavoring to increase your sense of securi= ty, while doing our best to minimize disruption to our day-to-day business.  Primary responsibility for Enron Corp. Security resides in our business con= trols organization.  You can contact this organization through their websit= e (<http://home.enron.com/security>), by phone (713-345-2804), or by email = (CorporateSecurity@enron.com <mailto:CorporateSecurity@enron.com>).  John B= rindle, Senior Director, Business Controls, leads this organization.  Pleas= e feel free to provide John and his team with your comments and questions, = or to report security threats.  We have two areas to update you on:  changes in the access procedures for t= he Enron Center Campus in Houston and changes to our travel advisory.  Access to the Enron Center  Over the next few days, the following access control procedures will be ins= tituted at the Enron Center (and other facilities where practical):  ?=09As employees swipe their badges at the card readers to enter the Enron = Center, a guard will match the photo on the badge to the bearer.  ?=09Employees and contractors who forget their badges must present a valid = picture ID to obtain access to the Enron Center (U.S. driver's license, U.S= . or foreign passport, or some form of U.S. federal, state or local identif= ication).=20  ?=09Visitors to the Enron Center must produce a valid photo ID when signing=  in at the lobby reception desk and must completely fill out the visitor ca= rd.  Adult visitors without a valid photo ID (U.S. driver's license, U.S. o= r foreign passport, or some form of U.S. federal, state or local identifica= tion) will not be allowed access to the Enron Center.  ?=09Visitors to Enron facilities must be escorted by an Enron employee or b= adged contractor at all times.  ?=09Visitors to the Enron Center will be met in the lobby by an Enron emplo= yee or badged contractor, signed into a visitor's log at the lobby receptio= n area by the employee or badged contractor, and escorted to their appointm= ent.  At the conclusion of the appointment, the visitor will be escorted to=  the lobby by an employee or badged contractor, the visitor badge collected= , and the visitor signed out in the log at the plaza reception area by the = escorting employee or badged contractor.  ?=09Employees are also being asked to participate in the security of their = workplace by following these guidelines; report suspicious activity to Secu= rity (phone 3-6300), do not open secured doors for individuals unknown to y= ou or hold doors open, allowing ""tail gating"" by others.  These will be the first in a series of new security procedures to be instit= uted at Enron.  We ask that all employees be patient during congested times=  in the lobby.  As we proceed and obtain increased guard personnel and equi= pment, we expect the inconvenience to decrease.  We hope you understand the= se measures are being instituted for the security of all our employees. =09   Travel Advisory Update  With the beginning of retaliatory strikes, we have two important recommenda= tions:  ?=09While the retaliatory strikes are ongoing, corporate security recommend= s that travel through or to the Middle East be avoided.  We continue to str= ongly recommend that all travel during this time to Afghanistan, Yemen, Pak= istan, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Sudan, Somalia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Geo= rgia, and the Kyrgyz Republic be canceled.  In addition, we recommend that = planned travel to Egypt, Israel, Gaza/West Bank, Jordan, Lebanon, Saudi Ara= bia, Syria, and Algeria be very carefully considered.  ?=09For non-U.S. citizens traveling in the United States, corporate securit= y recommends that you carry documentation.  There have been several recent = reports of non-U.S. citizens who reside in the United States being question= ed and asked for documentation when boarding U.S. domestic flights. As a re= sult, we suggest that all non-U.S. citizens who currently reside in the Uni= ted States - and who do not have Permanent Resident Alien status - carry th= eir passport, Form I-94 and Form I-797 at all times.  We would also suggest=  that Permanent Resident Aliens carry their Permanent Resident (Green) Card=  as proof of their status as a precautionary measure.  It appears that Immi= gration Officials may be applying a section of the Immigration and National= ity Act that requires individuals over the age of 18 to carry his/her ""regi= stration"" documentation with them at all times. This can include a Permanen= t Resident Card, Form I-94 card, Employment Authorization Card, Border Cros= sing Card, or a Temporary Resident Card. Immigration Officials have not his= torically been asking domestic travelers for ""registration"" documentation, = but in light of the heightened security measures and current atmosphere, it=  would be best to be prepared with all of your documentation proving your c= urrent lawful status.  We will keep you apprised of new information and developments on the Corpor= ate Security website and by e-mail, as appropriate.

You will also be receiving a Merger Update on this announcement later this morning.                  Niagara Mohawk?National Grid Merger Joint Proposal           Expected to Drop Residential Electricity Bills 5 percent         New York State Department of Public Service Staff, IBEW Local 97,       Business, Consumer, and Environmental Groups Support Agreement        SYRACUSE and WESTBOROUGH, Oct. 12 ? Niagara Mohawk Power Corp.'s  residential customers are expected to see a 5 percent electricity bill  decrease under a proposed merger and rate plan settlement agreement  announced by Niagara Mohawk Holdings Inc. (NYSE:NMK) and National Grid  Group plc (NYSE: NGG).  The agreement, reached with the New York State  Department of Public Service staff and other parties, was filed late  Thursday with the New York State Public Service Commission for approval.  If the merger closes, it would result in net customer savings of about $1  billion over the next 10 years, compared with rates projected without the  merger.  Also, as part of the agreement, the companies would expand Niagara  Mohawk's annual Upstate New York economic development efforts by $12.5  million.       ""Niagara Mohawk's merger with National Grid will allow us to reduce  and stabilize energy delivery costs and enhance our commitment to economic  development in the communities we serve,"" said William F. Edwards, Niagara  Mohawk's senior vice president and chief financial officer.  ""We believe  this agreement will provide significant benefits to Upstate customers and  to the economy.""       ""The rate cuts, low-income protection, and other benefits agreed to in  this plan will help National Grid fulfill our commitment to become a  positive presence in Upstate New York,"" said Lawrence Reilly, senior vice  president and general counsel for National Grid USA.       ""The significant size of the merged companies will provide us with the  resources and skills necessary to deliver first-rate customer service while  being a low-cost provider of electricity and natural gas service,"" he said.  He added that the agreement details a comprehensive service quality plan  under which customer safety, reliability, and service will be maintained  and enhanced after the merger.  The plan calls for up to $24 million in  annual penalties ? or more under certain conditions ? if defined customer  service and reliability goals aren't achieved.       Niagara Mohawk's actual costs for delivery of electricity are expected  to drop by more than 8 percent through the merger.  When those savings are  applied to a customer's entire electricity bill ? which also includes the  cost of electricity purchased ? the net savings are projected to equal 5  percent.       The reduction would be implemented upon consummation of the merger.  At that time, today's agreement calls for customers' delivery charges to be  immediately reduced by approximately $160 million.  After that decrease,  delivery charges would remain stabilized for  10 years subject to limited adjustments.  In addition, the companies would  forgo collection of approximately $850 million in nuclear costs that  otherwise would have been collected from customers.       The long-term proposal has a number of other initiatives, including:  ?    Price-stabilized electricity commodity service for residential and small commercial customers for several years, providing those customers with significant protection from any major fluctuations in the generation marketplace. ?    The extension by 16 months of a multi-year gas rate settlement, resulting in gas delivery rates -- unchanged since 1996 -- remaining the same through December 2004. ?    The extension of the Low-Income Customer Assistance Program, which was expanded under Niagara Mohawk's existing regulatory agreement with the PSC, and the development of a special rate for eligible low-income customers. ?    The establishment of electricity choice educational programs targeted to customers and energy service companies. ?    Environmental benefits such as interconnection assistance for wind power sources, support for ""green"" power marketing, and the continued sale of surplus land for preservation.      The agreement culminates five months of negotiations among Niagara  Mohawk, National Grid, the Department of Public Service staff, and other  parties including large industrial customers,  energy service companies, and various state agencies.        ""This joint proposal continues the recent downward trend in Niagara  Mohawk's delivery rates for businesses and provides additional rate and  service options for those customers, all of which should enhance business  expansion and economic development across Upstate New York,"" said Robert  Loughney on behalf of Multiple Intervenors, a trade association  representing the interests of the state's largest commercial and industrial  employers.       The proposed settlement is supported by two major national  environmental groups: the Natural Resources Defense Council, and  Environmental Defense.  It also is supported by the American Wind Energy  Association and by Community Energy, a green power marketing company.       ""The merger agreement benefits the environment and the economy, by  providing customers with an easy way to purchase renewable energy products  on their electricity bill, and by stimulating a large new investment in  wind energy generation in Upstate New York,"" said David Wooley, counsel for  the four environmental interests.  ""In this proposal, National Grid  demonstrates that it intends to continue Niagara Mohawk's established  record of responsible environmental stewardship.""       A leading advocacy group for low-income customers also supports the  joint settlement proposal.       ""Specifically and positively addressed in this proposal are the needs  of many customers who struggle to make ends meet,"" said Ben Wiles, an  attorney for the Public Utility Law Project.  ""The opportunity created by  the merger of National Grid USA and Niagara Mohawk will result in a special  reduced rate for as many as 60,000 eligible low-income customers.  It also  will expand Niagara Mohawk's safety net program to allow more people to  receive assistance.""       Among the other parties to sign the settlement was the International  Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local 97, which represents Niagara  Mohawk's unionized work force.  In addition, the Distributed Generation  Power Coalition, energy marketers, energy services companies, and regional  economic development agencies support the settlement proposal.       The companies have asked that the matter be considered at the PSC's  Nov. 28 meeting.  The merger also is subject to Securities and Exchange  Commission approval.       Niagara Mohawk Holdings Inc. is an investor-owned energy services  company that provides electricity to more than 1.5 million customers across  24,000 square miles of Upstate New York.  The company also delivers natural  gas to more than 540,000 customers over 4,500 square miles of eastern,  central, and northern New York.       National Grid USA includes local electric companies Massachusetts  Electric, Narragansett Electric, Granite State Electric, Nantucket  Electric, and a substantial transmission business.  Its parent company,  National Grid Group plc, builds, owns, and operates electric and  telecommunications networks around the world.

At a current billing rate of $80 per hour, engaging me  (with a specialization in this field for over 11 years)  for basic document  production activity generally will produce a meaningful cost savings  vs. utilization of even the most junior, inexperienced associate in an  outside counsel firm for such tasks.  I think I've mentioned to you before  that I have particular expertise in dealing with productions of electronic  documents -- especially email in a variety of application formats.   Second --and more importantly -- I  have reflected several years about what my ideal job would be, if  I were to go to work again on a permanent basis.  This week, I finally  took time to draft out a general job description of that job.  I have  called it, for now, a ""Legal Information Counsel"" position within a corporate  law department.  My draft job description is also attached.      I believe a strong case can be made  to justify such a position in many large, diverse corporations with multiple  lines of business.  In a nutshell, that justification is twofold:  (1)  avoidance of repeated re-inventions of the wheel across an organization, as it  relates to the expensive process of handling documents and data generated  by complex litigation and other corporate legal matters;  and (2) taking a  proactive leadership approach to legally significant information in a  corporation, vs. constantly being in a reactive mode as new fires break  out.     I urge you to review both my resume,  and the Legal Information Counsel description attached, and then let me come in  to visit with you about them.  I am particularly interested in your  reaction and comments to the Legal Information Counsel concept, over and above  whether such a position might be an appropriate addition to the Enron Corporate  Law Department.     I appreciate your time, Jim, and  look forward to having the opportunity to visit with you again.

"   -----Original Message----- From:  Enron Announcements/Corp/Enron@ENRON   On Behalf Of Office of the Chairman-@ENRON Sent: Tuesday, October 16, 2001 9:26 AM To: All Enron Worldwide@ENRON Subject: Third Quarter Earnings Results   Today, we announced our third quarter earnings results, which were right on target with analysts estimates for recurring earnings per diluted share of $0.43.  This marks a 26 percent increase over the third quarter of last year, which is due to the strong performance of our core wholesale and retail energy businesses and our natural gas pipelines.  In addition, we also announced that we are on track for our earnings target of $0.45 for the fourth quarter ($1.80 for 2001) and $2.15 for 2002.  We made a commitment to you that we would provide you with timely information about Enron's business strategy and performance, so this email is intended to provide an explanation about our earnings this quarter.  Over the past few months, we have met with analysts to discuss Enron's performance.  We received considerable feedback from investors and analysts that we needed to expand our financial reporting to include details for more of our business units.  In response to that feedback, we have provided results separately for several of our business units.  For example, while we have provided volume figures for North America and Europe, this is the first quarter we have provided financials separately for Enron Americas and for Europe and Other Commodities.  In addition, information about our global assets had previously been included in our numbers for Wholesale Services.  This quarter they are reported separately.   Finally, even though our broadband business is now part of Enron Wholesale Services, we are continuing to report that business separately.  Following are the highlights of our businesses:  Wholesale Services: Total income before interest, minority interests and taxes (IBIT) increased 28% to $754 million in the third quarter.  Total wholesale physical volumes increased 65% to 88.2 trillion British thermal units equivalent per day (Tbtue/d). Americas: IBIT increased 31% to $701 million.  Natural gas volumes increased 6% to 26.7 Tbtu/d, and power volumes increased 77% to 290 million megawatt hours (MWh). Europe and Other Commodity Markets: IBIT remained unchanged at $53 million as compared to last year.  While physical gas and power volumes increased, low volatility in these markets caused profitability to remain flat.  Retail Services: Enron Energy Services reported IBIT of $71 million, compared to $27 million a year ago.  So far this year, EES has completed more than 50 transactions with large customers and more than 95,000 deals with small business customers.   Transportation and Distribution:  Natural Gas Pipelines: IBIT increased slightly to $85 million in the third quarter. Portland General: We reported an IBIT loss of $(17) million this quarter compared to IBIT of $74 million a year ago.  This loss is due to power contracts PGE entered into at prices that were significantly higher than actual settled prices during the third quarter.  Last week, we  announced an agreement to sell PGE to Northwest Natural.  This transaction is expected to close next year. Global Assets: This segment includes Elektro, Dabhol, TGS, Azurix and Enron Wind.  Third quarter IBIT remained unchanged at $19 million compared to last year.  Broadband Services: IBIT losses were $(80) million in the current quarter compared to a $(20) million loss last year.  This quarter's results include significantly lower investment-related income and lower operating costs.  Corporate and other: This segment includes the unallocated expenses associated with general corporate functions. This segment reported an IBIT loss of $(59) million compared to $(106) million a year ago.  In addition, this quarter we announced one-time charges of $1.01 billion.  Over the past few quarters, we have conducted a thorough  review of our businesses and have decided to take certain charges to clear away issues that have clouded the performance and earnings potential  of our core businesses.  These charges include: ? A $287 million write-down of Azurix Corp. ? $183 million associated with the restructuring of Broadband Services.  This includes severance costs, a loss on the sale of inventory like servers and routers, and a write-down of the value of our content services contracts due to the bankruptcy of a number of customers. ? $544 million related to losses from certain investments, primarily Enron's interest in The New Power Company, broadband and technology investments and early termination of a structured finance arrangement.    With our announcements this quarter we accomplished three things:  1) we showed continued strong earnings and earnings growth in our core businesses, 2) we cleared away those things that were clouding this superb performance in our core businesses, and 3) We expanded our reporting of financial results to increase transparency for our investors.

"Ken, Mark, and Greg:  a thoughtful piece regarding Dabhol by The Hindu.  Jim   -----Original Message----- From:  Leach, Doug   Sent: Tuesday, October 16, 2001 9:21 AM To: Lundstrom, Bruce; Walls Jr., Rob; Derrick Jr., James Subject: FW: Article sent from The Hindu  fyi   -----Original Message----- From:  thehindu@admin.hinduonnet.com@ENRON   Sent: Tuesday, October 16, 2001 8:43 AM To: undisclosed-recipients:;@ENRON Subject: Article sent from The Hindu  An interesting article.  Could it happen? ============================================================= This article is emailed to you by tushar s. dhruv ( tushar.dhruv@enron.com ) ============================================================= Source: The Hindu (http://www.hinduonnet.com)  Dabhol and the do nothing Government  By Prem Shankar Jha  Ever since the Vajpayee's Government came to power more than two and a half years ago, the economy has been sliding relentlessly into the deepest recession it has ever known. In the nine months since December industrial growth has averaged 1.7 per cent. The decade when it averaged 9 per cent and the months, only five years ago, when it touched 16.2 per cent, are now but a distant memory. Consumer demand was utterly flat before the September 11 terrorist strikes in the U.S. It has now shrunk dramatically - vehicle sales dropped by 20 percent in September and colour TV sets registered a growth of a measly 3 to 4 per cent. With no demand to power it, inflation, measured by the consumer price index, has fallen almost to zero. The share market is dead and there is no fresh investment. Employment in the organised sector is shrinking in absolute terms for the first time in human memory.  In the past three years two million new job seekers have tried to find a place, however humble, in the organised sector of the economy but been turned away. By 2004, the number will have risen by another three million. But Mr. Yashwant Sinha is confident that a good monsoon will revive demand and by itself solve all of the country's problems.  But one recent event highlights the government's paralysis more sharply than any ream of statisitcs can ever do. This is its failure to react to the defeat in a London Consumer court of the Maharashtra State Electricity Boards's attempt to foil Enron's bid to take it before an international arbitration court by claiming that a case was pending before an Indian court challenging the arbitration clause in the power purchase agreement.  The London Court correctly maintained that just as a government's international obligations as defined by the Treaty or the agreement supercede its obligations under domestic law, proceedings in an international court must take precedence over those in a domestic court. The way has, therefore, been cleared for India to face the humiliation of being dragged before an international tribunal for a breach of it contractual obligations.  Given the fearsome proficiency of Enron's lawyers, both those whom they retain and those who drafted the power purchase agreement, it is virtually a foregone conclusion that the MSEB will lose the case. If that happens, then by a conservative estimate, India will have to pay around $5 billion, in costs and damages. In addition it will have to spend a little more to complete phase II of the project. Thus in the end the project is likely to cost not $3 billion but more like $5.2 to 5.4 billion. For much of the year or more that this demeaning dispute has dragged on, the Centre played ostrich and pretended that this was simply a dispute between a State Government and a private company, and it had no say in the matter. That pretext in any case wore thin when New Delhi refused to honour its counter- guarantee after the MSEB stopped paying its monthly dues. But today it has been exposed for the hollow sham it was because neither the MSEB nor the Maharashtra Government is even capable, let alone willing, to pay such an enormous penalty. So the bill will, inevitably land at the Centre's door. And that means the taxpayer's door.  The Centre will have no option but to pay. But having done so, will it then gift the project to the Maharashtra government? The answer, obviously, is no. What it will be forced to do is transfer it to the National Thermal Power Corporation to complete and operate. But since no one can possibly run a $5 billion power plant generating 2,100 MW of power profitably, the NTPC too will insist on the capital value of the project being substantially written down first. Judging from the offers that the Tata Electric Company and the Bombay Suburban Electricity Supply Company (BSES) were making to Enron, the written down value will not exceed $2 billion. Thus, whichever way we look at it, the country will end by paying for a Dabhol-size power plant ($3 billion) without getting a single watt of electricity or for that matter anything else) in return.  None of the above criticism is intended to deny that Enron probably did gold plate the Dabhol project once the Narasimha Rao government agreed to price its power on a cost-plus basis. Nor is it intended to mitigate the criticism of the Rao government that had it only brought the Maharashtra government and more particularly the MSEB into the negotiations from the beginning the latter's inability under law to pay backup charges at more than twice the rate being demanded by public sector power plants would have been exposed long ago.  But the mistakes of the past cannot in any circumstances justify even greater mistakes in the future. For better or for worse, the Enron deal was struck, and it was struck not once but twice. As a serious, responsible government that knows the importance of honouring one's word in a world where contract is king, the Vajpayee Government must honour the country's contractual obligations. This does not in any way preclude its trying to alter its terms by negotiation to avoid pitfalls that it did not see, but by definition all future changes must be by mutual consent.  The changes that Enron will accept and will make Dabhol's power affordable, are known to all. As the 1995 Renegotiating Committee and the Godbole Committee recommended, the Government should buy the $800 million LNG regasification plant and turn it into a separate company that can supply gas to all the current and future users on the west coast. In fact, it could go one better and bring in a foreign strategic partner to invest in and manage the plant. This is entirely feasible because its installed capacity is more than twice what Dabhol is likely to need. This will bring down the capital cost, upon which backup charges and cost per unit of power will be calculated, to $2.2 billion.  Second, the Central Government should buy 30 per cent of the equity in Dabhol from the promoters. This was negotiated with the 1995 committee but the MSEB could not raise the funds to do so. This will bring down the cost that has to be serviced in foreign exchange to $1.9 billion and the debt portion whose servicing represents a fixed charge in foreign exchange to $1.2 billion.  The Centre could also follow up a suggestion made by the chairman of BSES to convert a part of the foreign exchange into rupee debt. That will reduce further the vulnerability of electricity tariffs to changes in the exchange rate. With the price of oil having fallen (for India) to around $20 a barrel, these changes will bring down the cost of Dabhol's power at 90 per cent capacity utilisation own to below Rs. 2.40 a unit. This will make it entirely viable, especially if Maharashtra and the neighbouring states agree to make a marginal increase in the average power tariff or are able to bring down power theft and reduce subsidies to the pseudo-rural sector.  The right course for the centre even at this late stage will be to take over the project from the MSEB, renegotiate it with Enron, or if Enron wants to opt out, then buy the project from it at cost and make the above structural changes on its own before handing it over to the NTPC. Getting dragged to court will neither solve the problem of paying for Dabhol's power nor answer the more basic question - how can any electricity grid add new power plants to itself without raising the average tariff it charges for electricity.

The organization was founded in 1966 along with the establishment of Jones Hall (construction began in 1964 under John Jones/Houston Endowment leadership) and represents some of the finest performers, dancers, musicians in the world.  We are appealing more broadly to our local foundations and need your help to allow them to continue their fine outreach program.  As you can imagine, the flooding of Jones Hall in June virtually devastated their offices and their archives, but their outreach and education programs have continued due to the staff's dedication to the arts.  They even managed to hang onto Mormon Tabernacle Choir when Jones Hall was flooded by moving them over to Reliant Hall.  Our city needs as much relief and beauty as we can muster in these difficult times.  Thank you for strongly favoring this request.

I am the General Counsel of Niagara Mohawk Holding's unregulated subsidiaries, Niagara Mohawk Energy, Inc. and Niagara Mohawk Energy Marketing, Inc. We expect the sale of Niagara Mohawk Energy Marketing to close in November or December of this year, pending FERC approval, and a sale of Niagara Mohawk Energy's Distributed Power and Energy Services Business units may occur contemporaneously with that closing. Therefore, I am now pursuing other career opportunities.       I am a good candidate for an in-house counsel position at Enron because of my 12 years experience as an attorney in the energy industry. As General Counsel for the Company, I provide legal services and business advise to senior management and the Board of Directors of both the energy marketing and the energy services subsidiaries. My experience includes drafting and negotiating gas and electric retail sales agreements and master agreements and related documents for wholesale energy trading and marketing transactions, including physical transactions and financial instruments such as swaps. I monitor and I am responsible for representing my company in FERC and state regulatory proceedings. I keep up to date on the fast moving events and trends in the energy marketing and trading industry by closely monitoring regulatory proceedings, reading information that is published in trade and related energy industry publications and my involvement with the National Energy Marketers Association and the Federal Energy Bar Association. I am also responsible for representing the company and managing outside counsel in litigation and alternative dispute resolution proceedings. My experience includes utility regulatory and legal matters, the transactional work associated with corporate mergers and acquisitions, corporate governance, human resource/employee issues, interconnection agreements, municipal law, leasing, financing and secured transaction agreements, commercial contracts, condemnation litigation and real property matters.       I have attached my resume for your review. Please contact me at your earliest convenience to schedule an interview. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

" Jim,  we are evaluating 3 metals assets acquisition opportunities:   1. the Longview alumina smelter in Washington State  2. the Vanalco alumina smelter in Washington State  3. an Arco/BP aluminum rolling facility in Kentucky.  I would like to run with one external US firm on these deals (the 3 deals are at exactly the same preliminary stage and there will be some economies of scale to be had. Also consistency of approach is important). The firm also needs to have strong offices with metals expertise both in London and New York and preferably close to the facilities in question.   The firm I believe can deliver these advantages is Shearman and Sterling. I have spoken to a couple of people in the Houston office about this to get their views.  I would be grateful for your confirmation that you have no objection to this.  Thanks very much Jim.            Mark    J.

"Dear Mr. Derrick:   Thank you for including me in this venture.  It promises to be fun and useful.  Unfortunately, in terms of the November 2nd meeting, a faculty candidate I'm primarily responsible for is coming through the law school the same day.  He is giving a colloquium late morning/early afternoon and my wife and I are hosting the dinner for him and his wife that evening. So, especially given the post-9/11 logistics, it doesn't seem practical for me to come to Dallas for this meeting.  One possibility might be for me to participate by phone for a portion of the afternoon meeting and I would be happy to do so.  But given the nature and length of the meeting, this probably doesn't make sense - please let me know what you think.   Best regards.         - Henry Hu Henry T. C.

However, I firmly believe that this is not the real reason, the real one being for defying the wishes of my manager (Mr. Lowell Bezanis,Manager, EGM) who, I believe was acting in a discriminatory way towards me.  I have since filed a written complaint to Enron's EEO Committee.   This committee, having investigated the case, has acknowledged that there were working environment issues but has refused to provide me with a written report of their findings.  As a consequence, my reasonable request for a re-deployment package has been rejected.     If my employment is to be prematurely terminated I not only lose my job, but also my residence status in the US where I have lived in the past 8 years.  The HR department is fully aware of my situation and I feel that they were taking advantage of this fact when they asked me to sign a waiver not to sue Enron in exchange for protecting my status for 30 days.  I now feel that I am being pushed into a corner, unnecessarily, since all I have set out to achieve is to bring an awareness of the working conditions and the discrimination which is rife (not only towards myself but also to other employees, some of whom have left as a result) in the department and to move forward with practicable solutions.   I have enjoyed a number of years as an employee of Enron where I have performed to the best of my ability, often receiving compliments from clients.  This cannot be the only way to solve this issue!   The Trigger and Retaliation.      Since Mr. Bezanis has been my line manager, internal training opportunities have repeatedly been denied to me.  On August 28, I attended a class of 'natural gas structuring'. Mr. Bezanis called the Learning Center refusing to pay the associated costs, however, I was welcomed to remain in the class at no charge.   I felt that this situation could not continue and so I made an appointment with Ms. Shanna Funkhouser (my HR representative).  The day previous to the aforementioned meeting I was summoned to appear before Ms.Funkhouser.  Mr. Bezanis and Mr. Jeff Andrews were present in the conference room as I entered.  Feeling intimidated, I requested that I meet with Ms. Funkhouser privately the next day in order to submit a formal complaint regarding the EEO, as agreed previously.  She refused and continued with what I can only describe as adisciplinary by accusing me of excessive use of Enron property and equipment.  I was suspended and sent home with pay with possible termination. Ms. Funkhouser explained that her actions were based on the following:   -        the assumption that I was making long distance personal calls from work  -        that I was making jobapplications by company email   Unequal Employment Opportunities and Unfair Treatment.   As a manager, Mr. Bezanis has:   -        Intentionally and consistently limited my employment opportunities in terms of training and performance appraisals.  He has repeatedly disapproved of my training courses without good cause since he refuses to explain his disapproval.   -        Shown unfavorable bias towards my job performance (PRC process) which according to the PRC rules should be judged also by my peers' and clients' by review.  Until now, Iam still have not been informed of my PRC results.   -        Made efforts to suppress my innovative ideas such as that of creating an 'energy index' as a potential useful trading instrument.  My idea was warmly welcomed by the team in the Department Offsite, but the reaction of Mr. Bezanis was of anger for not going through him first.  I was banned by him from developing the idea further.   Discrimination.   It is our belief that Mr. Bezanis has difficulty dealing with women employees, especially competent women, as equals.  His rough, stifling, and unfair management style has led to the resignation of Ms. Courtney Campbell, the other only woman reporting to him.         Hostile Working Environment.   The working environment under Mr. Bezanis has been an intimidating and abusive one. Derogatory language offensive to women is frequent and common.

Ms. Cindy Olson admitted that the PRC practices might be unfair, but she said she had no power to re-open the past PRC cases.

I feel I have been subjected to a victimization campaign while the whole Enron organization attempts to protect the managers, no matter how wrong they are.  I request your attention and help during my most difficult time.   I thank you for your understanding and commitment to a happy and positive resolution in this case.

I am the General Counsel of Niagara Mohawk    Holding's    unregulated subsidiaries, Niagara Mohawk Energy, Inc. and Niagara Mohawk    Energy    Marketing, Inc. We expect the sale of Niagara Mohawk Energy Marketing to    close    in November or December of this year, pending FERC approval, and a sale    of    Niagara Mohawk Energy's Distributed Power and Energy Services Business    units may    occur contemporaneously with that closing. Therefore, I am now pursuing    other    career opportunities.          I am a good candidate for an in-house counsel position at Enron    because of    my 12 years experience as an attorney in the energy industry. As General    Counsel    for the Company, I provide legal services and business advise to senior    management and the Board of Directors of both the energy marketing and    the    energy services subsidiaries. My experience includes drafting and    negotiating    gas and electric retail sales agreements and master agreements and    related    documents for wholesale energy trading and marketing transactions,    including    physical transactions and financial instruments such as swaps. I monitor    and I    am responsible for representing my company in FERC and state regulatory    proceedings. I keep up to date on the fast moving events and trends in    the    energy marketing and trading industry by closely monitoring regulatory    proceedings, reading information that is published in trade and related    energy    industry publications and my involvement with the National Energy    Marketers    Association and the Federal Energy Bar Association. I am also    responsible for    representing the company and managing outside counsel in litigation and    alternative dispute resolution proceedings. My experience includes    utility    regulatory and legal matters, the transactional work associated with    corporate    mergers and acquisitions, corporate governance, human resource/employee    issues,    interconnection agreements, municipal law, leasing, financing and    secured    transaction agreements, commercial contracts, condemnation litigation    and real    property matters.          I have attached my resume for your review. Please contact me at    your    earliest convenience to schedule an interview. I look forward to hearing    from    you soon.          Thank you for your consideration.                              Very truly yours,                             Steven R.

" Jim,   I wanted to give you advance notice that the referenced matter could go to trial sometime during the week of October 22, 2001. This is a wrongful termination suit (sex discrimination/hostile work environment) which was filed on December 30, 1999.  Plaintiff seeks back pay, front pay and compensatory damages.  The case does not present substantial exposure to the company as Plaintiff's backpay claim is less than $20,000 and I believe that the likelihood of her recovery of frontpay or compensatory damages is remote, because she quit a job with Halliburton just a few months ago and because there simply is no evidence that she suffered compensatory damages since her discharge from EES.    The case is pending before Judge Patrick Mizell. Before he proceeds with the trial, the court will have to rule on the pending motions for summary judgment, which we have filed on behalf of EES and which could very well dispose of this case. Plaintiff has not timely responded to the motions. Last week, the court allowed Plaintiff's counsel to withdraw from the case, but the court assured me that he would not postpone the trial or the hearing on the pending motions. Plaintiff has indicated that she intends to hire replacement counsel, but to date no appearance has been made on her behalf.  I anticipate that she will be appearing pro se before the court.  The hearing on the motion is set for October 22, 2001 and I think there is a good chance that the MSJ will be granted.    Despite several attempts over the last three months to explore pretrial resolution of this matter, Plaintiff has refused to make a settlement demand or even meet with an EES human resource representative to discuss settlement. Her unwillingness to even discuss settlement is part of the reason that her former attorneys withdrew from the case. I fully expect that we will be required to take this matter through trial if the court does not rule in our favor on the pending motions. We have made the appropriate arrangements with witnesses so that if necessary, we will be ready to go next week. We are listed third or fourth on the trailing trial docket.   I will keep you advised of any further developments. Please contact me if you have any questions.       Bob Vote      713 853 7492",james.derrick@enron.com,robert.vote@enron.com,"Deena Hays v.

Their CEO was ordered to give a deposition in a case where he does not have unique or superior  knowledge of discoverable information. Our attempts to get it quash or obtain relief from the court of appeals and the Supreme Court have been unsuccessful. This issue is of importance to the jurisprudence of the state because more and more CEO's are being requested to give depositions and there is confusion in the law as to what an apex deponent is required to state in the affidavit in order to trigger the apex deposition doctrine. Must the affidavit state that he/she does not have ANY knowledge of relevant facts, rather than saying that he/she does not have any UNIQUE OR SUPERIOR knowledge of relevant facts as the Supreme Court said in Alcatel USA ?  At this point, our best chance in getting the court's attention is for the court to be flooded with amicus briefs requesting that the court take this case to resolve the conflict that exists among various courts of appeal. If the Supreme Court does not resolve the confusion that exist is the law at this time, litigants will continue to waste of time and money in fighting apex depositions.  Can you please forward this email to your membership to see if anyone is interested enough to file a quick amicus brief?  If anyone is interested, they can contact me or Kirsten Castaneda (214-740-8533) or Gary Powell (214-740-8470) in our Dallas office.

We anticipate a formal notification by the GOM of the probe and its terms of reference some time later today.  From what I understand he is considered more objective than some of the other proposed candidates and, to that extent, he may be less likely to mount a crusade against the company and its officers and directors.  At the same time, he is renowned for the glacial pace of the proceedings over which he presides.  Evidently, he tends to allow every interested party opportunities to intervene and be heard and the Narmada Dam resettlement which he evidently has also overseen, has dragged on for most of the last ten years. We'll try to find out a little more about what he's done recently and let you know what the bio looks like.  Obviously another logistical question of interest is how long it will actually take the commission to get up and running.  Suhas seemed to think it would take a couple of weeks for Kurdukar to organize financing from the GOM (good luck) and get a small staff together.  Needless to say, if there are other actions which we contemplate taking prior to the commission being convened, we probably should not wait.

Christopher Walker has recommended that Greg Reid of Linklaters join the team.  I believe that Greg is currently head of Linklaters International Arbitration group.  I've spoken with Barry Hunsaker and Stephen Wallace regarding Greg.  Both had very favorable things to say about Greg:  Hard-working, detail-oriented, smart, etc.  Neither of them had any reservations about Greg although he apparently does have a sharp sense of humor (so I can see why he and Chris get along).  Greg would not handle the ""India side"" of the litigation efforts which would remain with Chris.  He would help with the ""London side"" and the lender enforcement side (to the extent that occurs outside India).  In any event, Chris would remain as the leader of the overall litigation effort and we will expect Chris to keep tabs on matters Greg is handling to ensure the overall coordination of the effort.

I attach a short cv giving my professional and academic background. I have been at Linklaters for 16 years doing litigation and arbitration . For the last 2 years I have been co-ordinating L&A's European arbitration practice, but have, in the past, worked closely with Chris Walker. I have also had considerable exposure to power projects, both domestic and international (including an involvement in the Appeal to the Supreme Court in Pakistan on the Hub project).  Last year I successfully completed a significant arbitration for EOG. Please feel free to call Barry Hunsaker at EOG if you would like more background on that job. I am presently acting on a much smaller matter for Enron (taking instructions from Stephen Wallace) that comes to hearing in London on 8/9 November.  I am presently based in Paris, but spend about one third of my time in our London office. This is increasing and, as a result, I will be moving back to London in July/August of next year.

In my continued discussions with the financial community yesterday and today, it became clear that this move was required to restore investor confidence.  Jeff has unparalleled qualifications and a deep and thorough understanding of Enron.  He is already on the job and hard at work on the issues before us.  Andy Fastow will be on a leave of absence from the company.    Jeff had been serving as chairman and CEO of Enron Industrial Markets. He joined Enron in 1994 and spent three years in the London office as chief financial officer for Enron's European operations.  Upon returning to the U.S., Jeff was executive vice president of finance and treasurer for Enron Corp.  In 2000, he was named president and chief operating officer of Enron Net Works.  I know all of you are concerned about the continuing decline in our share price.  I am too, and we are working very hard to turn it around.  Appointing Jeff as CFO is one important step in that process.  But most of the solution involves just continuing to do our jobs with excellence.  The fundamentals of our business are strong, and I think the market will begin to see that as we continue to perform.

Basically, the press is reporting that we have dissolved the LJM partnerships, ended all relationships with the LJM entities, etc.  All that we have done is unwind the raptor entities, LJM still exists, all other transactions with LJM still exist, it's just that Andy sold his interest in the partnerships.  Michael Kopper owns them and would probably be considered a ""friend of Enron"" by investors/journalists.  I'm concerned about our efforts to build back investor confidence - do we correct the press?  how do we address this?  I'm concerned that we will once again be hit with credibility concerns when the press or investors fully understand that LJM still exists and we have deals still pending with it and have deals still in place with it.

"FYI   -----Original Message----- From:  Brownfeld, Gail   Sent: Tuesday, October 30, 2001 11:11 AM To: Derrick Jr., James; Haedicke, Mark E. Cc: Walls Jr., Rob; Sanders, Richard B. Subject: Sempra v. Enron   In September I sent you all a summary of the facts at issue in the above-referenced lawsuit. Since that time, several developments have occurred.  First, the trial date was moved from October 11, 2001 to November 13, 2001.  We have no reason to believe that we will not go to trial on the 13th.  We expect the trial to last from 10 days to 2 weeks. Judge Ira Gammerman will try the case. There is no jury.   The second development deals with the proposed summary judgment motions mentioned in my last e-mail.  Summary judgments on liability and damages have been filed and the plaintiffs have responded.  We have filed replies to their opposition papers.  In addition, the plaintiffs filed a cross-motion for summary judgment as to liability.  We filed opposition papers to this motion.  New York practice differs somewhat from Texas practice to the extent that we have no firm date for a hearing on these motions.  Although we are attempting to get a hearing before the trial date, the judge has complete discretion as to whether to hear the parties' motions for summary judgment before the start of trial.  The third development relates to the plaintiffs' theory of the case. It seems clear from the papers filed in response to our motions for summary judgment that the plaintiffs are fine-tuning their case to focus on the contracts' size distribution requirement arguing that the type of coal supplied by Enron, whether crushed or not, could never meet the contracts' size distribution requirement. The plaintiffs make this argument in simple terms and, when argued as such, it has some appeal. However, it is Enron's position that the contracts' language is ambiguous and the better (and much more complicated) approach advanced by the defendants is that the subject coal could and would have met the size distribution requirements. Issues of whether the contracts are installment contracts also play heavily in this analysis.   Fourth, since the last e-mail on this matter, we have learned that the plaintiffs are seeking $71 million in damages from Enron. This is approximately half of the amount of the contracts' damage cap.   Lastly, we finally received a response from the plaintiffs to the settlement proposal we made in June. The plaintiffs have offered to resolve this matter for a cash payment by Enron of $45 million. In the alternative, the plaintiffs have proposed a business alternative which is currently being investigated. Additionally, there is some discussion of mediation in the limited time remaining before trial.  Should you have any questions about this case or should you need any further information, please call me.   ",rex.rogers@enron.com,james.derrick@enron.com,FW: Sempra v.

Subject: Hello from Tulsa  CONFIDENTIAL  Good morning, gentlemen.  Mutual colleagues in the energy industry have suggested that I contact you directly about joining the Enron organization in a senior legal or business capacity.  I relocated from San Francisco to Tulsa in 1996 when I was recruited to join MAPCO in a General Counsel's position.  A year later, MAPCO was acquired by Williams, where I have served as one of four Associate General Counsel.  I have now learned that in a merger (even one billed as a merger of equals), it is preferable to be on the buyer's side rather than to be included among those who have been acquired!!!  Thus, I am seeking new opportunities at the Deputy/Associate General Counsel level.  Williams and Enron share many of the same businesses, operations and values.  The experience gained at MAPCO/Williams, coupled with general leadership and management skills, is easily portable to another energy company. Moreover, the Company's current difficulties may create the need for a senior lawyer with substantial litigation, government investigation and policy advocacy experience.  I get to Houston often and would very much like to meet with you even if only for an exploratory discussion. My CV is attached; also, I will send to you, under separate cover, a profile which was published in Diversity & the Bar magazibe, the quarterly insert to Corporate Counsel Monthly.  My office telephone number is 918-523-3354; I look forward to meeting with you  shortly.  Thank you for your consideration.  Very sincerely,  Kirk G.

" fyi   -----Original Message----- From:  Evans, Mark (London Legal)   Sent: Thursday, November 01, 2001 3:49 PM To: Haedicke, Mark E.; Walls Jr., Rob Subject: ENRON EUROPE   Mark, Rob  My apologies for adding to your burden at this difficult time. However hopefully this might clarify our discussions of yesterday and enable us all to move on quickly.  Enron Europe and its directors are facing two related issues:   1. Continuing to trade  The directors of EEL and its subsids have to be satisfied that there is a reasonable prospect of avoiding an insolvent liquidation. This is a fairly low hurdle to pass and, in our situation, calls made on Corp. for cash have been promptly met and we have read the news today of a new confirmed facility so we already have a fair degree of comfort.   The directors meet with independent counsel tomorrow but I believe that they will probably come out of that session asking for nothing more than a confirmation, by email to say Michael Brown, but from the top - Jeff or Greg, of where they currently see things, ie a positive prognosis for the future. That piece of electronic paper should be enough to enable the directors to reasonably conclude that we are not hurtling into Chapt 11 and to continue to trade. It would also be very helpful if that email could confirm that Michael would be promptly informed if things took a downward turn.    I would be happy to draft a note but wonder whether the best way of quickly putting this to bed might be for a conversation to be had with Jeff/Greg to see what they would be prepared to say. That could then be drafted up and sent over.    2. Filing accounts  The directors of Enron Europe and its subsids cannot file accounts on a going concern basis unless they are comfortable they will have adequate funds in the medium term to run their businesses. The hurdle here is higher than in point 1 above as prospective cash shortages would require the accounts to be qualified long before the directors would have to stop trading under point 1 above. So more comfort will probably be required here, which could include further details of the new facility (drawdown conditions and maturity periods) and prospects for further facilities being signed. This would back up the usual support letter.   I should add that we have not actually received this year the usual support letter from Corp. addressed to Enron Europe and its subsids. I don't know if it has been formally requested but we will definitely need to see that document this time around. Could you please point me in the right direction for that?   We now have until the end of January to file the accounts so point 1 above is definitely the immediately crucial issue. We would however like to resolve the accounts issue as soon as possible. Perhaps we could liaise with Joel to get a letter drafted and then signed by Jeff or Greg?    That's it. It really boils down to requiring a bit more information from Corp. There is absolutely no desire to cause problems here, just a desire to put in place the right pieces of information (which we are sure are out there but we need to collect them in) which will safeguard the European directors personally and enable them to move on from these concerns to the more pressing business of Q4.   Many thanks.            Mark     ",james.derrick@enron.com,rob.walls@enron.com,FW: ENRON EUROPE,2001-11-01 15:56:02-08:00,received

David, it can be challenged by Canadian tax authorities as an unlawful evasion if the taxable event has already occurred, and the tax is owed both by an employee as income tax and by the employer for withholding tax.  An arrangement or scheme that attempts to undo a taxable event that has already occurred may be challenged as a collusive attempt to evade taxes already due and owing.  It is kind of like trying to push the toothpaste back in the tube; it can be a mess.  Just because we may not understand it does not mean there is no problem.  Based on Enron's policy of compliance with the law in jurisdictions in which it does business, it is my recommendation that a written opinion of Canadian tax counsel be obtained based on a review of the facts and the documents.

Jim   -----Original Message----- From: =09Gold, Joe =20 Sent:=09Wednesday, November 07, 2001 10:38 AM To:=09McMahon, Jeffrey; Sherriff, John Cc:=09Kitchen, Louise; Bowen Jr., Raymond; Brown, Michael - COO London; Gol= d, Joe; Derrick Jr., James; Farmer, Michael; Heffron, Kevin; Hutchinson, Mi= chael; Jones, Timothy; Lynch, Drew Subject:=09EML Capital Adequacy and Liquidity   Jeff / John,  We have drafted a note relating to the business operations of Enron Metals = Limited (EML). As you know we have been particularly concerned about watchi= ng our cash position and thought that it would be of benefit for you to und= erstand the unique situation that EML has from a regulatory standpoint. Aft= er your review, we would be happy to set up a meeting to discuss. If you co= ncur with the actions suggested, please advise.  If there is any balance sh= eet, debtor/creditor or cash forecast information that you require, please = let us know.  Drew Lynch, Kevin Heffron, Jonathan Marsh, and Joe Gold    Introduction  Enron Metals Limited  (EML) maintains a unique position within Enron Corp. =  EML is one of Enron's two businesses regulated by the UK Financial Service= s Authority (FSA - the UK financial regulator) and Enron's only remaining b= rokerage business.  Given its special status, EML has responsibilities to i= ts clients that are codified and enforced by the rules of the FSA and the L= ME (metals exchange) of which it is a member.  As a result of this regulato= ry oversight, there are several differences between EML and Enron's other b= usinesses: 1)=09EML must conduct its business in compliance with prescriptive regulato= ry rules relating, among other areas to capital adequacy and conduct of bus= iness. Failure to comply with these regulatory requirements can result in d= isciplinary action being taken against the company itself and its officers.  2)=09By virtue of its position as an LME broker, there are certain circumst= ances in which EML is regarded as acting as agent for its clients.  EML's p= olicy has been to avoid acting as agent where possible; however, EML's cond= uct is evaluated by the FSA in light of the potential for that relationship=  to exist.  How EML conducts itself with clients is tightly regulated by th= e FSA and the LME.  3)=09Because the FSA has a duty to protect the orderliness of UK markets an= d to protect against systemic risk, EML's position as a provider of liquidi= ty and the potential for it to disturb the market through its conduct or la= ck of conduct is also an area for concern with the FSA and the LME. As a co= nsequence of this concern, the FSA requires regulated entities to maintain = prescribed amounts of capital to protect against certain risks such as posi= tion and credit risk. The rules relating to regulatory capital require FSA = regulated firms to calculate a financial resources requirement in accordanc= e with rules and to maintain financial resources in excess of this requirem= ent. These rules are prescriptive as to the types of capital, which can be = used by way of regulatory capital, and a breach of these rules is regarded = as extremely serious. An ongoing ability to meet a financial resources requ= irement usually results in the FSA issuing an order requiring the firm to c= ease carrying on business.  4)=09EML's board members and its traders are subject to direct regulatory o= versight by the FSA and can be disciplined in their individual capacity for=  a breach of the rules. Penalties for individuals include significant fines=  and possible expulsion from the industry. The duties owed by board members=  under the FSA's rules are in addition to those owed under general UK law r= elating to directors' duties.  Directors Overriding Ring Fencing Obligation  In the light of recent developments there is a premium on being able to dem= onstrate to the FSA that, to the full extent possible, the financial streng= th of EML is ring-fenced from any financial problems being encountered by t= he rest of Enron.  In order to make certain that we fulfil this obligation = we have changed the way we do business in the ways discussed below.  Issues Surrounding Liquidity  As we are all aware over the past week, as a result of the reputation probl= ems the corporation has been faced with, we have substantially increased th= e hands on financial and managerial oversight of EML.  This was a precautio= n against knock on problems causing liquidity issues for EML.  Clearly the = goal was to be able to feel absolutely certain that the financial standing = of EML was fully and completely ring- fenced from any problems related to t= he non-EML related problems of Enron.  This of course needed to be accompli= shed within the framework of continuing to be a fully integrated Enron comp= any as far as shared services and inter company commercial relationship was=  concerned =20  The FSA does not regulate the method under which a regulated entity obtains=  and distributes its cash.  In the event, that cash is lent outside of EML,=  it must be collateralised by an LC in order to preserve the regulatory cap= ital of the firm; however, the firm has a number of options to preserve its=  day to day liquidity.=20 =20 In its position as an LME broker, EML must have access to cash for two purp= oses.  First, it must be able to post margin to the London Clearing House (= LCH).  In the event that liquidity ever prevented EML from posting collater= al to the LCH, it would be in breach of the LCH rules and regulatory enforc= ement action could ensue. In addition it would be declared a defaulter and = the LCH would have the right to close out all of its positions.  Second, it=  must be able to post margin to its clients.  A failure to make a contractu= al payment to a client would likely result in FSA action if it were referre= d to the FSA.  A third potential use of cash is to make payments to in-the-= money clients in the event that they wish to close their account.  While th= ere is no contractual right for a client to cash in their mark-to-market pr= ofits, the failure of EML to make such payment would cause reputation quest= ions.  Previously, we believed there were only a small number of potential scenari= os where we might be faced with not having sufficient liquidity. However ce= rtain significant components of these scenarios have unfortunately come to = fruition and the amount of cash maintained by EML and its ring fencing from=  the rest of Enron has become a concern.  EML has or is in the process of l= osing $60,000,000 of unsecured LC's, which were primarily used in lieu of c= ash at the LCH.  EML has had to use its cash to replace or secure those LC'= s.  Additionally, a number of clients have requested that their accounts be=  transferred.  Those transfers have reduced EML's cash balance.  Was the re= maining $50 mm unsecured LC (which has been issued by a single bank) to be = withdrawn we are not currently in position to immediately manage the liquid= ity impact.  The work done and the events of this past week have highlighted the need fo= r being fully prepared for any foreseeable eventuality.  Therefore we have = agreed to start to do the following a.=09Change the way our financing works so as to maintain our excess liquid= ity on our own balance sheet rather than being a provider of liquidity to t= he rest of the enterprise b.=09Improve our overall cash management function so as to have the control=  as well as the oversight be the direct responsibility of EML personnel c.=09Manage the business so as to maximize liquidity within the constraints=  of continuing to do business on a normal basis d.=09Obtain financial information on a much more timely basis e.=09Periodically perform a number of analytical stress scenario tests so a= s to be certain that we continue to have sufficient internal liquidity f.=09 Undertake to formalize arrangements with EMGL for provision of additi= onal liquidity whether on an unsecured subordinated or senior basis when ou= r own liquidity is insufficient to run the business on normal basis  Operational Risk =20  In theory, EML could be run on a small cash balance held in its own account= s and rely on Enron Corp. for the remaining portion of its day to day cash = needs.  EML's board have been resistant to this practice for several very p= ractical reasons.  First, it is possible that the LCH could unexpectedly ca= ll on EML to provide a large amount of collateral on an immediate basis.  I= f EML relied on Enron Corp.'s daily wire transfer for its liquidity needs, = it would be in danger that either a liquidity shortfall at Corp. or an acco= unting or administrative error somewhere in the system could trigger either=  capital or liquidity events as EML's clearing account at Citibank would be=  substantially overdrawn.  Given the likelihood that an LCH or FSA event mi= ght create a cascade for Enron, EML's board is reluctant to put that much f= aith in the 100% accuracy of our operational safeguards.  Capital  As noted above, EML is subject to the FSA's regulatory capital rules and mu= st calculate its financial resources on a daily basis.  The FSA requires th= at EML notify it if its capital base is less than 110% of the minimum finan= cial resources requirement.  For a variety of reasons, there were occasions=  when EML violated the 110% threshold on occasions in 2001. Because these v= iolations were self-contained and easily remedied the FSA did not take enfo= rcement action and EML instituted an internal procedure whereby it maintain= s financial resources in excess of 120% so that it has a sufficient buffer = not to trigger the FSA notification requirement. In the current climate the=  FSA has expressed concerns about the possible systemic risk that might ari= se from Enron's perceived financial weakness. Accordingly, if one of those = violations occurred today, the FSA would likely commence a formal investiga= tion of EML and could issue an order requiring EML to cease trading in ligh= t of the need to reassure the FSA and in light of the sizable changes in EM= L's cash position and client positions that have been occurring on a daily = basis, EML's board has been attempting to maintain a regulatory capital lev= el of 130%.  Clearly the ability to maintain sufficient liquidity and exces= s capital adequacy go hand in hand. =20  Liquidity and Capital Adequacy Stress Testing  The stress testing noted above has been based on the following types of sce= narios, which would cause liquidity issues for EML  1)=09Changes in market prices causing additional losses by internal or exte= rnal clients for whom we either provide credit or receive margin collateral=  rather than cash resulting in EML financing these losses at the LCH 2)=09Changes in market prices causing additional losses by the EML house ac= count resulting in EML financing these losses at the LCH 3)=09Clients with credit balances transferring those balances to other LME = brokers 4)=09Withdrawal of LCH letters of guaranty by the providing banks and the i= nability to replace the bank guaranty on an unsecured basis resulting in ca= sh being placed either with the issuing bank or the LCH directly=20 5)=09Credit exposures leading to credit losses  Recommendations  The result of the stress testing has been to make us consider the following=  changes to the way we do our business in addition to trying to increase ov= erall operational liquidity  1)=09To fully draw down the remaining $25 mm available under the  $125 mm s= ubordinated facility 2)=09To monetize the inter-company marked to market positions (+$20 mm) 3)=09To increase the subordinated facility to $175 mm and extend the maturi= ty by six months to July 2002 4)=09To monetize to the degree possible all external marked to market profi= ts and other assets held by EML 5)=09To stop providing credit for in house Enron counterparts and to switch=  to a either one way or mutually margining with a zero or very low threshol= d for calling margin 6)=09To stop providing or reduce the amount of credit for clients, other th= an a select group of key relationship clients=20 7)=09To continue to move large physical positions to the physical trading c= ompanies (EMCL and EMCC) therefore shifting the need for inventory finance   Current Situation  Unsecured Guaranty=09=09=09$65 mm Secured Guaranty=09=09=09$15 mm Subordinated Loans=09=09=09$107 mm EML Cash Balance:=09=09=09$59 mm Cash required to replace Withdrawn guaranty=09=09=09($20mm)   EML Regulatory Capital Level:=09128% Excess Reg.

The clear choice, in all of our minds, is Jonathan Gaisman.  (See attached file: Jonathan Gaisman.doc)His litigation practice is prinicipally insurance related.  He has done political risk insurance matters relating to Eastern Europe.  He spoke definitively about practices of different underwriters in the market (i.e., to re-insure, to craft policies, etc.) He knows, quite well, the small community of barristers who may be called upon by Lloyds to handle this.  His wife is from India (though Scottish) and he spends holiday time there and knows the country and the people.  He worked on North Sea disputes representing Enron in the past.  He is straightforward, inquisitive, prepared, thoughtful, and interested in working on this with us.  He is also used to working with large American clients.  The downside is that, in his words, he does ""not have limitless time.""  He is expecting to be involved in a rather large case in the first half of next year.  Alistair Schaff was not a very seasoned barrister, and unprepared for our meeting (in the sense that he hadn't even bothered to read anything about us or the case before we got there  --  I did not get the sense he was too busy to do so).  He has worked on de facto 'takings' in Iraq cases, and has had a number of cases that have involved questions of mitigation.  In addition, he seemed familiar with the option to sue clause in many policies.  He has done some work in the distant past with the GOI on letters of credit and shipping matters.  He was the only one that mentioned that we might spend some time in the near term thinking about what events we might 'cause' to occur that could help our claims.  Richard Jacobs is a fairly young barrister, but had read up on our case and did some preliminary research on case law on political risk insurance issues (which, incidentally, all four barristers agree hardly exists).  He did some PRI work in Russia in the early 1990s, and represented brokers in a lender PRI claim regarding a South Seas power station. He stated that many insurance coverage issues (no matter the type of policy) are basically the same questions with a different twist.    Interestingly, he has just given some advice to a European investor about a dispute in India on a power plant (contractual matter, not insurance related).  He definitely grasped that a detailed review of the facts would be the driver for an expropriation claim.  He has travelled to India.  He has capacity to work with us in the next 4-8 weeks and beyond.  He would be a solid guy to use as a back-up.  Stewart Boyd, as you will recall from his CV, is an experienced barrister (58 years old), who sits as an international arbitrator often. He has a relationship with Lord Mustill, for what that is worth.  He does alot of insurance and re-insurance work, though he says that not many political risk insurance cases have reached the bar.  He has worked on a leading case involving ECGD, and was, interestingly, an expert witness in an OPIC coverage case recently.  {We may consider him for just that role, on the DIC issue, should we decide to sue in Texas.} He has dealt with many projects of this type and magnitude, from a contractual dispute point of view, and done quite a bit of work in the electricity sector on privatization matters.  He has done a couple of projects (shipping and petroleum industry) in India.  He is available for the next couple of weeks, booked for most of December, and then frees up again.  I would rank him a strong second choice.  I would propose that we issue Gaisman instructions tomorrow or Monday.  If you agree, let me know and I will take care of it.

Cc: Walls Jr., Rob Subject: FW: ENRON EUROPE   Mark,  I'd be grateful if we could have a short conversation today at a convenient time to suit you to discuss:  1. The West LB LC facility. Corp still has not formed a view on whether we can give the ""no material litigation"" rep. so we cannot revert to West LB. Apart from the ?55m potentially available from WLB, Enron Europe now have NO LC facilities available. This is hurting us. Even if the answer is negative, at least we could give WLB a clear answer and negotiate to draw down on the facility.  2. Wrongful trading comfort. The directors having taken independent advice and been told that some fairly low level comfort is needed from Houston, noise and nervousness is now growing at this end because it has not been forthcoming. I attach a draft which would suffice.    Can we please talk about how we can get Jeff McMahon to send this to Michael Brown.  3.ICI Counterindemnities and TXU: I discussed these with Jeff Hodge yesterday. Do you need anything more from me on these?     Thanks          Mark    -----Original Message----- From:  Evans, Mark (London Legal)   Sent: 01 November 2001 21:49 To: Haedicke, Mark E.; Walls Jr., Rob Subject: ENRON EUROPE   Mark, Rob  My apologies for adding to your burden at this difficult time. However hopefully this might clarify our discussions of yesterday and enable us all to move on quickly.  Enron Europe and its directors are facing two related issues:   1. Continuing to trade  The directors of EEL and its subsids have to be satisfied that there is a reasonable prospect of avoiding an insolvent liquidation. This is a fairly low hurdle to pass and, in our situation, calls made on Corp. for cash have been promptly met and we have read the news today of a new confirmed facility so we already have a fair degree of comfort.   The directors meet with independent counsel tomorrow but I believe that they will probably come out of that session asking for nothing more than a confirmation, by email to say Michael Brown, but from the top - Jeff or Greg, of where they currently see things, ie a positive prognosis for the future. That piece of electronic paper should be enough to enable the directors to reasonably conclude that we are not hurtling into Chapt 11 and to continue to trade. It would also be very helpful if that email could confirm that Michael would be promptly informed if things took a downward turn.    I would be happy to draft a note but wonder whether the best way of quickly putting this to bed might be for a conversation to be had with Jeff/Greg to see what they would be prepared to say. That could then be drafted up and sent over.    2. Filing accounts  The directors of Enron Europe and its subsids cannot file accounts on a going concern basis unless they are comfortable they will have adequate funds in the medium term to run their businesses. The hurdle here is higher than in point 1 above as prospective cash shortages would require the accounts to be qualified long before the directors would have to stop trading under point 1 above. So more comfort will probably be required here, which could include further details of the new facility (drawdown conditions and maturity periods) and prospects for further facilities being signed. This would back up the usual support letter.   I should add that we have not actually received this year the usual support letter from Corp. addressed to Enron Europe and its subsids. I don't know if it has been formally requested but we will definitely need to see that document this time around. Could you please point me in the right direction for that?   We now have until the end of January to file the accounts so point 1 above is definitely the immediately crucial issue. We would however like to resolve the accounts issue as soon as possible. Perhaps we could liaise with Joel to get a letter drafted and then signed by Jeff or Greg?    That's it. It really boils down to requiring a bit more information from Corp. There is absolutely no desire to cause problems here, just a desire to put in place the right pieces of information (which we are sure are out there but we need to collect them in) which will safeguard the European directors personally and enable them to move on from these concerns to the more pressing business of Q4.

" FYR  -----Original Message----- From:  Ken Lay - Office of the Chairman   Sent: Tuesday, November 13, 2001 6:15 PM To: DL-GA-all_enron_worldwide1 Subject: Change of Control Provisions   As many of you know, I have a provision in my employment contract which provides for a payment of $20 million per year for the remaining term of my contract in the event of a change of control of Enron.  The merger with Dynegy, or a similar transaction with any other company, would trigger this provision on closing.  Assuming the merger with Dynegy is closed within 6-9 months, as we expect, this provision would entitle me to total payments of slightly more than $60 million.  Many CEOs have change of control provisions in their employment contracts and mine has been in place since 1989.  But given the current circumstances facing the company and our employees, I have been giving a lot of thought these last few days to what to do about this payment.  Initially, I thought I would use part of the funds for a foundation for our employees and take the remainder in stock and cash.  However, after talking to a number of employees this afternoon, I have decided that the best course of action would be for me to waive my right to any of this payment.  Therefore, at closing, I will receive no payments under this provision.  I know this action does not remedy the uncertainty that you and your families face.  But please know that I will continue to do everything in my power to serve the best interests of Enron's employees and shareholders.  I am still very proud of what we have built at Enron, and I want to continue working with all of you to correct the problems and restore Enron to its rightful place in the energy industry.

However hopefully this might clarify our discussions of yesterday and enable us all to move on quickly.  Enron Europe and its directors are facing two related issues:   1. Continuing to trade  The directors of EEL and its subsids have to be satisfied that there is a reasonable prospect of avoiding an insolvent liquidation. This is a fairly low hurdle to pass and, in our situation, calls made on Corp. for cash have been promptly met and we have read the news today of a new confirmed facility so we already have a fair degree of comfort.   The directors meet with independent counsel tomorrow but I believe that they will probably come out of that session asking for nothing more than a confirmation, by email to say Michael Brown, but from the top - Jeff or Greg, of where they currently see things, ie a positive prognosis for the future. That piece of electronic paper should be enough to enable the directors to reasonably conclude that we are not hurtling into Chapt 11 and to continue to trade. It would also be very helpful if that email could confirm that Michael would be promptly informed if things took a downward turn.    I would be happy to draft a note but wonder whether the best way of quickly putting this to bed might be for a conversation to be had with Jeff/Greg to see what they would be prepared to say. That could then be drafted up and sent over.    2. Filing accounts  The directors of Enron Europe and its subsids cannot file accounts on a going concern basis unless they are comfortable they will have adequate funds in the medium term to run their businesses. The hurdle here is higher than in point 1 above as prospective cash shortages would require the accounts to be qualified long before the directors would have to stop trading under point 1 above. So more comfort will probably be required here, which could include further details of the new facility (drawdown conditions and maturity periods) and prospects for further facilities being signed. This would back up the usual support letter.   I should add that we have not actually received this year the usual support letter from Corp. addressed to Enron Europe and its subsids.

As you probably know, our employee, Barbara O'Banion, started in the position earlier this week.  I will be calling Britt soon to check on Barbara's progress.  On a separate note, I want to offer you our services as you and your legal team strategize your defense of the recent shareholder suits.  Ad Hoc has been an integral component in staffing complex, multi-party litigation for companies of your size -- we have supplied as many as 90 temps on a single piece of litigation.  We have considerable experience designing and recruiting flexible, cost-efficient teams of knowledgeable legal professionals who can handle the routine aspects of a document review, while your permanent staff works on more sophisticated matters.  Likewise, as your transactional counterparts at Enron begin working on the merger's due diligence review, I hope Ad Hoc can offer its experience.  We supplied the largest number of temporary lawyers and paralegals to conduct document reviews in both the El Paso/Coastal and Exxon/Mobil mergers.  We were also involved in the Chevron/Texaco merger and the Waste Management buyout.  Please do not hesitate to call on me at any time if I can be of assistance.

I am concerned that all this will be lost given what has gone on in recent weeks and months and what will continue to go on in 2002 with legal matters.  One pitch I have is that I could finish the interviews and revisions focusing on the many positives before the merger to ensure that this record exists for posterity.  Could you prioritize a meeting with Ken to discuss what I have and where we could go with it in the future either internally or externally?  A lot of ideas are running through my head.  Cindy Olson is also involved with this, and I need to talk to Jim Derrick some  for the legal angle.

This letter will be sent to all directors of the Company.  The accounts for this Company were due to be filed at the end of February 2001. Unfortunately a filing extension request (form 244) was never filed and the accounts must now be filed by 3 December at the latest to avoid penalties being incurred.   The April accounts require a Letter of Comfort to be supplied from Enron, and in the current situation this will not be possible within the timescale for filing. (The Letter of Comfort is required as the Company requires inter-company loans to remain in place for the Company to remain solvent).   To solve this problem, the Balance Sheet of TME Engineers Limited is being restructured to ensure the directors can sign on a going concern basis, and this will be arranged within the next few days. Peter Pentecost will be calling each of you over the next couple of days to explain the background to the problem more fully and to outline the solution/answer any questions you may have.    In case for any reason the restructure of the Balance Sheet cannot be completed by the 3 December deadline, we are agreeing with Arthur Andersen an alternative basis for the audit opinion to be signed, such that the Accounts can still be signed off and submitted by the Directors in time.   In the meantime, if you have any questions or concerns regarding this issue,  please contact Brian Muscroft on 0044 207 783 2703.

The existing Answer as to how options will be converted is as follows:  ""The number of options will be converted on the same ratio as outstanding shares are converted.  Your number of Enron options will be multiplied by 0.2685 to calculate the number of Dynegy options at close.  At the closing of the merger, the strike price on your Enron options will be divided (sic) by the merger ratio 0.2685 to determine the strike price of the new Dynegy options.""  I believe the strike price should be multiplied by the merger ratio [or at the very least stay the same].  If it is done the way the current ""Answer"" suggests, Enron option holders take a double hit---the shares they have options on are reduced by three quarters and the strike prices [which were already under water] get multiplied by four.  I would guess that application of the current ""Answer""  totally eliminates all existing options, as a practical matter.  I'm pretty sure I am right.  Have the Answer people made a typo or misunderstood how conversion is to take place, or is there a problem with the existing merger agreement that needs to be addressed and corrected?  Please advise.","legal <.schuler@enron.com>, mary.joyce@enron.com",james.derrick@enron.com,FW: stock options----application of the conversion ratio to  existing options appears incorrect,2001-11-15 11:56:00-08:00,sent

"  Chuck and I just got off the phone with Uriel Dutton about F&J's representation.  F&J's key concern appears to be a potential ethical conflict that may arise if (a) F&J continues to represent Enron Corp., as it is currently doing with respect to IP matters and some asbestosis litigation and (b) F&J is tendered litigation or arbitration adverse to Enron Corp, even if substantially unrelated to the current matters.  Dutton confirmed that he was aware of no such litigation or arbitration having been tendered to F&J.     Dutton advises that while under the Texas rules of ethics, outside counsel can represent a party adverse to an existing client if the matters are not substantially related, that is not necessarily true if the matter is in federal court in Texas or brought in the courts of other states.  Further, even if a client such as Enron Corp. is willing to give an advance general ethical waiver, without knowledge of what future adverse matters F&J may take on, such ""blind waivers (my term)"" are often not upheld.  Dutton believes, however, that with respect to matter handled for former clients, it is generally the rule everywhere that there needs to be a ""substantial relationship"" between the matters for any potential ethical bar to arise.  In other words, it sounds like F&J wants to remove at least Enron Corp. from its list of current clients as soon as reasonably possible.   Dutton did say that with respect to the other F&J matters, the bulk of which are related to Mariner, there may be some accommodation that may be reached.  Dutton will speak further with his colleagues and get back with us.  I will call Prof. Dzienkowski at the UT School of Law (our speaker for many years at the Unit CLE ethics seminar) and see if I can get some free advice about these issues.  I will of course only be speaking hypothetically.   I will keep you advised.   Britt     ",james.derrick@enron.com,britt.davis@enron.com,In re F&J Representation,2001-11-19 09:41:29-08:00,received

Our members have asked me to write to you, in your capacity as Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, to express our views concerning the importance of the Federal Judiciary.          The tragic events of September 11 underscore for all of us the freedoms that we enjoy in our country. We know that you and your fellow Senators on the Judiciary Committee are devoted to helping protect these precious freedoms. We also know that you and your fellow Senators recognize the critical importance of our system of justice in preserving and protecting these freedoms.          We write to express our thanks to you and your colleagues for your efforts in reviewing the qualifications of individuals nominated for Federal District Court and Circuit Court positions. Recognizing the need for a fully-staffed Federal Judiciary, we also appreciate all your efforts in determining the qualifications of nominees for the Judiciary as expeditiously as possible.           If our organization, or any of our members, may ever be of assistance in any way, I hope you will call upon us. Thank you.                                           Sincerely,    cc:     The Honorable Orrin G. Hatch, Ranking Minority Member         The Honorable Joseph R.

"   I have now spoken with the following people in doing further due diligence:   1.  Theresa Bushman.  Theresa tells me that she shares the view with Mariner's GC that it would be helpful to have F&J continue to represent Mariner for the time being, given F&J's knowledge of Mariner's corporate history.  Theresa, if I have mischaracterized what you told me, please respond.   2.   Kelly Zelacovitz, Mariner's GC.  Kelly advised me recently that she has a new corporate matter of some urgency that she wants to retain F&J to handle, subject to your approval.  Kelly told me that she would be contacting you about this.   3.   Prof. John Dzienkowski of the University School of Law.   John has given me his informal thoughts over the telephone on the ethical issues, based on hypotheticals I presented to him; of course, these are not to be taken as recommendations.  In a nutshell, John thinks it would be problematic for a law firm to unilaterally withdraw from the representation of a corporate client solely and only to be able to take on more business potentially adverse to that client in the future.  John thinks it might be appropriate to ask for a disgorgement of fees paid under these circumstances.   4.  Uriel Dutton.  Dutton says that with an appropriate waiver letter, F&J would be willing to continue its representation of Enron and the Enron subsidiaries, including Mariner and the proposed new Mariner matter, conditioned on the following:   a.  F&J could not continue to represent Corp. on  one of the three IP matters, which is the nonprovisional patent application (although Dutton was not specific, I believe F&J lists it as the ""Method and System for the Determination of VAR"").   b.  F&J would continue to represent Corp. on the six or so abestosis matters in order to try and get Corp. dismissed, but with the understanding that if dismissal was not available, that new representation would be obtained by Corp. before trial.   c.  Dutton will be sending over a draft proposed waiver letter for our consideration.   We told Dutton that we anticipated getting back to him on this matter early next week.  Although Dutton will be out of the office next week, he will be reachable by cell phone.

The Civic Center will be going to City Council  this week to ask for monies to rebuild the SPA and Symphony offices, and the  rehearsal hall, music library, instrument storage, etc.  If approved, I'm  told the City will allow us to have the offices rebuilt by the contractor of our  choice.  We will want the contractor who originally built our offices 6 or  7 years ago. However, the rebuild will take between 10 and 12 weeks.  That  means we will not return to offices until, say, end of February, assuming some  work will be accomplished in December. We told Enron that we should return to Jones Hall  by the end of this year; obviously that won't happen. Of course, we would want  to remain in our present offices on the 37th floor of Three Allen Center until  the end of February.  But, is this possible?  Do you have any idea  what might happen to your space here, and whether we can remain?  Shall we  remain quiet, hoping nobody notices us?  Let me know, please, if there is  anything I can do to remain in these offices. Thanks",james.derrick@enron.com,mattox@spahouston.org,Office Space,2001-11-26 16:36:21-08:00,received

Will you please advise wether you agree with accepting this sum as full and final settlement.

"  Bob and I just spoke with Steve Susman.  I tried to mention the points you asked.  Here are his comments:   1.  F&J probably could not simply send us our files back and put itself in a position to be adverse to us with Arthur Anderson.  Susman believes that there is a ""hot potato"" rule that prevents F&J from doing so.   2.  That being said, Susman doesn't care if F&J represents Arthur Anderson or anyone else potentially adverse to us in the actions he is handling.    3.  Susman would not, however, agree to a broad advance ethical waiver, as proposed by F&J.  He does not believe such waivers are effective.  Susman would agree to a waiver once we were advised who F&J wanted to represent.  I don't know whether F&J would agree to this or not.    4.  Susman recognizes that we cannot force F&J to take on the new Mariner matter, and that this is ultimately a risk/benefit decision for us to make, and that we may have to agree to terms that we otherwise wouldn't agree to.    Parenthetically, I have received no comments on F&J's proposed waiver letter.   Under the circumstances, from his standpoint, Bob is inclined for us to get the best deal on the waiver letter that we can with F&J, but that if F&J won't budge, that we take something along the lines of what they have given us (Bob, let me know if I have mischaracterized your thoughts).     From my standpoint, I unfortunately think there are some parts of the letter that we must have changed.  This would be to the extent that the letter purports to have Enron Corp. agree to bind all the Enron entities, and to the extent that it involves Enron's agreement to what will happen after the Dynegy merger (as I set out in my earlier e-mail).  My recommendation would be, as set forth in my earlier e-mail, that only the Enron entities currently being represented by F&J sign it and be bound by it, and to remove the language regarding what Enron would agree to after the Dynegy merger.  I also find the advance ethical waiver language repugnant, but could agree to it if the other modifications mentioned could be made.  I do not know whether F&J would be willing to make these changes or not.   Our biggest problem right now is time-management.  I know that Mariner wanted to make a decision by today as to who to use.  I am willing to confer with Dutton ASAP to see what F&J would agree to, and if he can agree in principle, to send him a proposed draft agreement.  I believe he is out of the office but is checking his voice-mail.     Please let me know what you want me to do.

"  This follows up on my voice-mail to you of just a few minutes ago.  I reviewed a voice-mail from Theresa Bushman this morning about the timing on the new Mariner matter that Mariner for which Mariner would like to retain F&J.  She has spoken with Scott Josie, apparently one of our business people, and has been advised that the December 27 closing is critical, due to market conditions.  Theresa also believes that the December 27 date will be aggressive even for F&J, given the late date.  Theresa, please let me know if I have mischaracterized what you said.   I see two options:   1.  If you agree with me that we can't sign the letter as is:  I do my best to get an acceptable letter negotiated with Uriel Dutton today.  If I can't, Mariner retains someone else today.   Frankly, I am not optimistic about getting an acceptable letter from F&J, based on where F&J started.   2.  If you believe that we need to go ahead and get the best deal we can from F&J under the circumstances: I will do my best to get that done by noon or so, and if F&J doesn't budge, we may have to sign the letter as is.   Caveat:  I don't know if Dutton is in the office this week, so he and I may not be able to communicate quickly.  Also, if we redraft a letter, we will probably not have time to get comments back from all the other interested Enron attorneys.     I would also suggest telling Kelly Zelacovitz, Mariner's GC, this morning what our game plan is, and if it is option one, have her go ahead and contact her back-up choices of law firms, start running conflicts checks, etc., and have them be ready to hit the ground running.

"Lisa, I would appreciate your asking the appropriate attorney to focus on this. Thank you. Jim   -----Original Message----- From:  Mason, Heidi   Sent: Wednesday, November 28, 2001 12:52 PM To: Mcclellan, George Cc: Minns, David; Staley, Stuart; Derrick Jr., James; McGrory, Robert Subject: Directorship Of ECAP  George  Further to our conversation of 5am today Sydney time, I am today formally resigning as a Director of Enron Coal Asia Pacific Pty Ltd (ECAP). As I have been discussing with Stu for the past few weeks, in the current environment it has been increasingly difficult for me to carry out my duties as a Director without an ongoing commercial knowledge of the operation. Further to this, with the accounting now being done from London, I have no day to day contact with ECAP's financial position and this further complicates my position.   In light of this concern I advised Stu a few weeks ago that it would be preferable to have one of the resident commercial staff take over this role and I believe this would now be the appropriate action for ECAP to take. My resignation will leave ECAP with no resident Director as is required under Aust Corporations law. (As promised I will have our trading lawyer, Robert McGrory, send you an email today outlining the implications of this breech). While this will cause a deterioration in the position of ECAP, I feel I have no option but to take this action given the current position of Enron and our alternate views on the implications of these for ECAP. I have previously indicated to Stu that this is a matter that would need to be addressed and the lack of resolution is not sufficient reason for me to retain the role.   The action of Dynergy in terminating the proposed merger today would indicate that a review of the ability of ECAP to meet all current debts should be undertaken and had I remained as a Director I would have been recommending that a Board meeting be called to address this matter and potentially appoint an administrator if required. This action has been conducted for every other company in Sydney, hence similar consideration by ECAP Directors must be an immediate priority. Unless the Directors can satisfied yourselves that all debts will be met as and when they fall due an Administrator must be appointed to avoid personal liability and potential criminal liability. An new debts subsequently incurred included ongoing rent, travel and operating costs will be come personal liabilities of the Directors.

ATTN:JAMES  INTRODUCTION *Organization of African Health and Economic Development (OAHED), was created with a vision to coordinates efforts to combat diseases and promote physical and mental health. Contribute significantly to eradicate communicable diseases and promoting improved sanitation and health condition in Africa and promote economic development. *OAHED based on a common vision on economic stabilization strategies and shared conviction , that (OAHED) have  a pressing duty  to eradicate poverty and diseases and to place Africa countries both individually and collectively on the path of sustainable growth development at the same time participate actively in the world economy. *The programmme of (OAHED) is anchored on the determination  of Africans to extricate themselves and the continent from the malaise of underdevelopment and exclusion in the world globalization. *Poverty and backwardness of African stand in stark contrast to the prosperity of the developed world.The continued imagination of Africa from the globalisaton process and the social exclusion of the vast majority of its people constitute a serious threat to global stability. *In Africa, 365 million peoples or half of the population live on less than $1.00 per day.The mortality rate of children under 5years of age is 140 per 1000 and life expectancy at birth is only 54 years. Only 41 percent of the population have access to safe water, medical care, education etc. The high rate of illiteracy for people over 15 is 54 percent. *OAHED calls for the reversal of this abnormal situation by changing the relationship that underpins it.African are appealing neither for the further entrenchment of dependency through aid, nor for margical concession. *We are convinced that an historical opportunity present itself to end the scourge of underdevelopment that afflicts Africa. The resources, including capital, technology and human skills that are required to launch a global war on poverty and underdevelopment exist in abundance.What is required to mobilize these resource and use them properly, is bold and imaginative leadership that is genuinely committed to a sustained effort of human upliftment and poverty eradication as well as a new global partnership based on shared responsibility and mutual interest. *In the circumstance, Organization of African Health and Economic Development(OAHED) hereby declare that we will no longer allow ourselves/African countries to be conditioned by circumstances. We determine our own destiny and call on the rest of the world to help and complement our efforts. There are already signs of progress and hopes. Democratic regimes that are committed to the protection of human rights, peoples centered development and market oriented economies are on the increase. African people have begun to demonstrate their refusal to accept poor economic and political leadership.These development are,  however uneven and inadequate and head to be further expedited. OAHED is about consolidating and accelerating these gains. It is a call  for a new relationship of partnership  between African and the international community, especially the highly industrialised countries, to overcome the development chasm that has of course widened over centuries of unequal relations. *Our perfect knowledge in respect of the high level of your commitment and goodness in the vineyard of humanity impressed and impelled us to seek for your kind assistance to establish the (OAHED) liaison office in the Gambia. The materials and funds needed for the effective take-off are as follow: 1.Cost of renting /furnishing office??????????.USD$38,000.00 2.Logistics, ie, vehicles???????????????USD$325,000.00 3.Staff emolument, mobility and communication etc????USD$57,000.00 4.Contingency  (5%)     Grand Total ???????????????????USD$420,000.00 In the light of this, we are now on board in a situation not to be described caused by financial difficulty. We have no facilities neither have we any money to purchase those materials that are absolutely necessary in this issue.Your goodness to humanity has ever been such as leaves not the smallest doubt you will not suffer us to starve in the situation  you have been pleased to place us, and which is such as will ever tend to make us the most grateful/happy and to ensure success as well as accomplish the set-up goals.You  will be induced to take this issue into consideration an urgent intervention in this impediment, and by a little pecuniary aid, please save us from this impasse.It will be an act worthy of your self, and that imprint upon our heart which will never be erased. *OAHED will welcome any assistance you render to enable us put in place the relevant infrastructures that would enhance the effective and the presence of Organization of African Health and Economic Development in the Gambia. Any assistance given should be considered a worthwhile service to God and Humanity .If you require any further information or clarification in any point, please do not hesitate to ask.

While I can see that there may be reservations in accepting the re-appointment of Andersen for ENS I feel that we should consider the implications of finding another auditor at this late stage.  Andersen in Warsaw are well aware of the problems ENS is facing at the present time with regard to power and gas pricing; they are aware of the problems associated with the Settlement Agreement and it's accounting treatment to date. They are familiar with our systems and people. We have also negotiated a significant reduction in fees compared with last year.  New auditors would have to be taken through all the issues from scratch. This would consume time not only from the accounting department but throughout the Company. The audit would take longer and, at this stage, I'm not sure when any new auditors would be able to start given that January is their busiest period. Andersen are available with immediate effect since I have constantly been impressing on them that, given the complexity of ENS problems, we should allow ourselves the maximum amount of time to consider what to put into the report should some problems persist longer than envisaged.  I feel that a change in auditors at this moment in time would be not be in our best interests in view of the above. Also if the ownership of ENS is to be changed it would be beneficial to have audited accounts in double quick time since potential investors will undoubtedly be looking for such statements.

N.V. is formally in charge. At this moment The Party's are still employed by and working for Enron in the Netherlands. Until now it looks like though The Party's will not receive the monthly payment for December 2001 that will be due on the 20th of this month (as per the respective labour contracts). Untill this month the actual payment came from the UK but it is very unlikely that this will be the case in December and onwards.  Furthermore we know that Enron Netherlands B.V. has sufficient funds in 3 different bankaccounts (in cash and collateral) and will therefore not be able to go bankrupt at this moment in time.  As Equity Trust Co. N.V. is formally in charge of this particular entity they are able (and even obliged) to do the monthly payment but they will only facilitate this as soon as they have received sufficient instructions. The instruction should not only instruct them to do the monthly payment as such but also explicitly tell them to use the available cash and/or collateral for that. For your information: the collateral I am talking about is currently still in the hands of the Dutch Transmission System Operator ('Tennet') as a kind of guarantee for the trading we used to do but no longer (can) do.  Please note as a practicality that the necessary administrative handling regarding the monthly payments (calculating nett amounts etc.) is done by PriceWaterhouseCoopers in Rotterdam. For details regarding the specific and individual monthly payment obligations of Enron Netherlands B.V. towards The Party's Equity Trust can contact mrs. Kenny Toekimin or mrs. Helene van Bommel at PWC on telephone number +31 10 400 8600.

"Jim,   as I mentioned to you earlier we are forging ahead with the Enron Corp. interests project in Europe.  We commenced our work based on discussions with Jim Fallon, Ray Bowen and others about a week ago and plan to pay the employees with funds currently held by EEFT.  I expect to receive tomorrow a formalized structure for the teams, again organized around EEFT.  As I understand it, however, this proposal will not address any retention bonuses for the teams because this issue is still under discussion.  I have been told that there is hesitancy on the part of some in Houston to provide for such payments but I do not know the reason for that hesitancy.    May I suggest that it would be entirely appropriate to provide for retention payments in this case.  As I have mentioned, part of this project is to recover value from existing contracts in entities such as ECTRIC, which value is estimated in the aggregate to be $150 to 200 million.  Another aspect of the Corp. interest project is to properly wind up entities so as to recover value and minimize director liabilities.  A proposal was made that a percentage of the recovered value would be put into a bonus pool and shared among all of the team members, whether those individuals had focused on recovery of funds or minimizing liabilities.  I am told that this proposal was rejected in a conference call held today.  I am very concerned about our ability to keep people working on this project without some additional incentive.  The project is extremely difficult and many people, in particular the traders who are in a position to protect value in ECTRIC, have other job options.  In addition, the employees on the team are aware that many individuals who are working on PWC teams are receiving retention payments.  If the team to protect the ECTRIC interests is not retained in the short term, ECTRIC is scheduled to be put into administration on January 4, resulting in termination of many of its in-the-money contracts and a loss of an estimated 50% of its value.   Jim, if you are inclined to support retention payments to help us maintain this effort going forward, will you please communicate that fact to Jim Fallon, Jeff McMahon and Ray Bowen tomorrow, as it is likely we will begin to lose people after Christmas.

"Dear Sir:  My understanding is that Mr. Rick Bergsieker and you are the only directors of Enron Middle East, Ltd., and that Mr. Darrin Donegan is the current local manager of this company.  I also understand that Mr. Bergsieker is not with Enron any more, Enron Middle East is still solvent, and it has very limited indebtedness, other than my outstanding expense claims.  PLEASE READ ON.  I was an employee of Enron from 9 September 1999 to 5 December 2001 and from 1 February 2001 to the end, my Enron employer was Enron Middle East.  During this time, I incurred business related expenses with the prior knowledge and approval of my supervisors totaling US$90,000.  I have duly filed and had approved these expense claims, but unfortunately have not received the reimbursement yet.  Mr. Clay Harris was my last boss and he is still with Enron (clay.harris@enron.com, EGM LNG team, London).  Ms. Kim Hickok (kim.hickok@enron.com) is the current EGM HR person and has the full documentation relating to the claim.  PLEASE READ ON.  Albeit very limited, Enron Middle East does have some assets.

" Alan, per my voice mail to you. Thank you. Jim  -----Original Message----- From:  ""Sertac Yener"" <yener@singnet.com.sg>@ENRON   Sent: Thursday, December 20, 2001 7:16 PM To: Derrick Jr., James Cc: Hickok, Kim; Harris, Clay; Donegan, Darrin Subject: Enron Middle East  Dear Sir:  My understanding is that Mr. Rick Bergsieker and you are the only directors of Enron Middle East, Ltd., and that Mr. Darrin Donegan is the current local manager of this company.  I also understand that Mr. Bergsieker is not with Enron any more, Enron Middle East is still solvent, and it has very limited indebtedness, other than my outstanding expense claims.  PLEASE READ ON.  I was an employee of Enron from 9 September 1999 to 5 December 2001 and from 1 February 2001 to the end, my Enron employer was Enron Middle East.  During this time, I incurred business related expenses with the prior knowledge and approval of my supervisors totaling US$90,000.  I have duly filed and had approved these expense claims, but unfortunately have not received the reimbursement yet.  Mr. Clay Harris was my last boss and he is still with Enron (clay.harris@enron.com, EGM LNG team, London).  Ms. Kim Hickok (kim.hickok@enron.com) is the current EGM HR person and has the full documentation relating to the claim.  PLEASE READ ON.  Albeit very limited, Enron Middle East does have some assets.  I plead with you to instruct Mr. Donegan to sell Enron Middle East's assets reimburse my pre-agreed, appropriately lodged, and duly approved expense claims, whose non-payment has been ruinous for my family.  I thank you for your help at these difficult times.
