First, the Cavanaugh/Edison bill will in part restructure Chapter 854 regarding the role of the default provider, and Edison will be asking for a solidification of its distribution role, so this it is the natural vehicle to redress aggregation. If we wait until next year it may be too late, because we will be pushing rather than pulling. I think Edison and PG&E may put up less of a fight in this context.  Second, while the League of Cities has not been involved, twelve cities and counties representing 2 million Californians passed a resolution last year asking the legislature for Community Choice. The leaders, from the Southern California Cities Joint Powers Consortium, San Francisco, Oakland, and Marin County, are actively involved in geting support from Bowen and Burton. Oakland is planning a statewide conference of cities and national leaders on Community Choice this Summer, which would coincide with committee hearings and attract media attention. In both Massachusetts and Ohio, we had weak support from the Leagues and did the job with about 35 municipalities represented. I am confident we will have that number in California this year.  Third, TURN is providing strong support for the bill. I believe CALPIRG, UCAN and other consumer groups will give strong support as a result of the national coalition for Community Choice legislation, RAGE, which has signed most of them on the agenda over the past two years.  Finally, the PUC is looking into Distribution Competition this year, and both the ORA and Strategic Planning are actively interested in Community Choice as a strategy for making the market work.  As you described it, the legislation allows municipalities to implement Community Choice programs, and does not require it.

Consequently, it's taken me  a while to set down some thoughts on how we might get the best out of the  market structure group.  Attached below is an initial stab at some ""terms of  reference"" to describe the scope and objectives of the group.  I thought this  might help us to come to a common understanding of what we are trying to  achieve.   I'm conscious that the one area that is a bit lacking is  ""Deliverables"", ie, what will we come up with as the output from this  process?  This needn't be a formal ""report"" - indeed I suspect that  establishing a regular process of information exchange and discussion is  likely to provide more durable benefits.  I'd very much welcome your views on our scope and objective over the next few  days.  I'd also welcome a brief update on which issues you are all working as  a way introducing our interest in the topic of market structure.  This should  also help to kick-start the process of exchanging ideas.  My own contribution  is below.  I've also attached a couple of documents that I think may be useful.  One I  prepared for the Federal Energy Commission in Russia as a statement of ""What  is a foreign investor looking for in a liberalised market?""  It was written  for an audience for whom a competitive electricity market is an alien  concept.  For example, we were attempting to change the FEC's mindset that  power marketers were an unnecessary layer of costs - because their ""tariff""  added to other participants tariffs would increase prices.  As a result it is  very high level and conceptual.  However, it has some value as a basic  delineation of where the key market structure issues lie.  The other  documents relate to the proposals for New Trading Arrangements in England and  Wales  (further information on these reforms can be obtained from the  regulator's website at http://www.ofgas.gov.uk/).  While far from perfect,  these reforms provide a good example of wholesale trading arrangement reform  for use elsewhere (for good or bad).  I'll be on vacation next week, but on my return I'd like to set up a video  conference/conference call to discuss how we can take things further.  Any  suggestions for agenda items for that would be most welcome.  Regards  Paul    ------------------------------------------  UK Electricity  The regulators - Ofgem and the DTI are is undertaking a massive programme of  reforming the electricity market in England and Wales.  These reforms have  followed the UK government's moratorium on new gas plant in late 1997 and are  designed to remove perceived ""distortions"" in the market.  The reforms centre  on:  New Electricity Trading Arrangements (NETA) to replace the Pool from October  this year.  We have had a significant input into the this process.  While  generally supportive of the proposals, we have opposed several undue  restrictions on managing risk. Plant divestment by major mid-merit generators to increase competition in the  price-setting part of the market.  We were instrumental in this process,  following our analysis late in 1997 of the costs of generator market power to  electricity consumers.  Divestment has since significantly increased the  liquidity and competition in the wholesale market.  Despite this the  regulator is seeking greater powers to intervene in the wholesale market to  prevent market ""manipulation"".  We think this represents an unacceptable  extension of regulatory power and are therefore likely to oppose the  regulator at the Competition Commission enquiry into this. New transmission access and pricing arrangements.  While these reforms may  have limited merit, in general we think they're a waste of time and our  existing asset positions are significantly exposed.  The regulator has just  started consulting on this and this is one area that I suspect your  experiences in the US and elsewhere might be useful to me.

The document does  not fully address all of the issues discussed at last Thursday's congestion  reform meeting in Sacramento, but I believe that (other than for some  details) it is consistent with what both the ISO and many of the market  participants are proposing.  This summary does not necessarily reflect the views of my clients, who  haven't yet had the time to review it... but I don't believe that it would be  too far off.    I am sending this summary to you to put into context the many comments that I  offered at last Thursday's meeting and also to support my view that, if the  ISO were to implement the CONG/ASM integration by DECENTRALIZING the process  rather than CENTRALIZING the process, there would not be much difference  between what I've been advocating in the Southwest and the CAISO's model.   (The primary remaining differences would be: (i) the way the ""hour-ahead""  process works - i.e., continuously vs. one discrete time; and (ii) the way  scheduling is done - i.e., the ISO would not act as the SC's representative  in acquiring rights that could be made available through inter-zonal  counterflows since the SCs would do this themselves.)  So there is a real  possibility that, with some agreement on the ISO's longer-term plans (whether  integration of transmission rights and ancillary services procurement will  rely on decentralization vs. centralization), we could bring together the  models for the region.

"Attached are cryptic summaries of the current positions.  WPTF, APX, ISO and  IEP are all fairly similar.  Enron is working with those parties to develop a  common proposal.  The ""Reform Coalition"" (RC) is Hogan, sponsored by Sempra,  with ORA/TURN/UCAN (they are all nuts), Reliant, Southern and WIlliams.   Without the gens, they were going nowhere.  Southern has already left the  coalition.  We and others have put a full court press on to Reliant (the  source of the problem is John Stout in Houston).  The word is that Reliant  will also leave -- we're hoping for a big splash saying both Southern and  Reliant have left.  The other confusing issue is --why Sempra/San Diego G&E?  Terry Winter, ISO  CEO and former officer at SDG&E, says that Sempra thinks nodalism is the only  way to get prices high enough in San Diego to encourage construction of more  power plants.  More power plants, more gas sales.    The first item is a matrix from mid-April laying out all the positions at the  time.  The RC has now introduced a slightly new proposal called ""voluntary""  -- the concept being that you may opt for nodal or zonal on a month-by-month  basis.  This had not much support at the meeting at the ISO on May 10 and 11  -- especially since you end up with nodalism anyway.  The next item is a VERY LONG (45 pps) ISO doc -- the ISO proposal is called  zonal forward -- from late April.  I also included APX's ""flowgate"" model, which has some intriquing  characteristics and which we can support with some slight modifications (it's  very close to what we have proposed, and may be easier to use in a world with  more parallel flows than we have today)  If you want more, more, MORE -- go to the ISO web site (caiso.com) then to  Client Services, then to congestion reform, to see all the gory detail.

"Load is up in CA and so is the potential for selling load curtailment  products to customers.   BOTTOMLINES:  PG&E has asked the CPUC to approve participation of E-19 and E-20 Direct  Access customers in the ISO A/S load participation pilot program (filed June  7).  SCE has asked the CPUC to approve that all customers on its Large Power  Interruptible tariff can participate in the ISO A/S load participation pilot  program (filed June 7).  FERC approved the ISO's Load Participation pilot progam and pricing on June  14, 2000, calling it an innovative program.  This appears to be a total GREEN LIGHT for Enron to move forward with  customers.   PROCESS:  The utilities filed advice letters.  Comments are due on June 27.  Unless you  tell us otherwise, we plan to file and seek expedited treatment. (The CPUC  has no required timetable in which to respond.)  We expect the CPUC to  approve them -- there is pressure from many fronts to DO something about load  participation in the market.  Both have asked for a July 17 effective date.   DETAILS:  SCE's is a much better document and makes a good case for CPUC approval, even  though the the customers are already benefitting from providing the utilities  with the option to curtail during system emergencies. SCE proposes the  following approach to prevent ""double-dipping"" by the customers:  If the ISO  directs SCE to activate its load curtailment program during the time period  that the customer has an accepted bid from the ISO in the A/S market, SCE --  working with the ISO -- will adjust the customer's bill to avoid double  payments.  SCE provides no more information, but, on principal, this seems  fair to me.  We'll have to watch to see what the proposed procedure would be.  PG&E doesn't say much except that it is ""unable"" to offer this to bundled  customers (oh, gee -- must be more of those ""system constraints"") until  ""later"" (unspecified).  I would expect large customer groups to argue about  that -- but it gives us the opportunity to push direct access.  PG&E didn't  have much to offer on the ""double-billing"" issue -- it said either PG&E could  change the customers bill or the ISO could adjust its payment.  FERC threw out all the protests by various parties (e.g., MWD, M-S-R, other  munis) and approved the ISO's proposal.

The FERC has made it clear that ISO does not have the ability to mandate that generators sell to  ISO at its price caps and that the proper response to inadequate supply is to  lift the price caps.  On Friday, the FERC issued its Order on Complaint in connection with the July  10 complaint filed by Morgan Stanley Capital Group Inc. (""MS"").  As you may  recall, MS requested FERC to issue a stay of the ISO's maximum purchase price  authority and to direct the ISO to reverse any price cap reductions.  MS  sought Fast Track processing pursuant to Rule 206(h), which was granted by  FERC on the grounds that the complaint ""warrants expeditious action.""  As a quick background summary for you, last November, FERC issued an order  approving Tariff Amendment 21 which extended ISO's price cap authority  through 11/15/00.  That order stated that the ISO ""maximum purchase price was  not a cap on what the seller may charge the ISO, but a cap on what the ISO  was willing to pay.""  The Commission said that sellers dissatisfied with the  price cap could ""choose to sell those services into the California Power  Exchange or bilateral markets.""  FERC notes in Friday's Order that the 6/28 the ISO's Board resolution lowered  the caps to $500 and ISO further directed that, ""To the extent permitted by  law, regulation and pre-existing contract, Management shall direct generators  to bid in all their capacity when system load exceeds 38,000 MW.""  The MS complaint alleged that the cap reduction was unlawful and would,  ""threaten the stability and integroty of the marketplace.""  MS also requested  an emergency technical conference to examine ISO's justification for the  price cap reduction.  FERC denied the MS stay request, as well as its request that the $750 maximum  purchase price be reinstated.  The Commission reiterates that it is not  approving a cap on sellers' prices, because they can sell at whatever price  they want.  Rather ISO has simply stated the maximum price it is willing to  pay.  ""Because sellers are not required to sell to the ISO, the ISO cannot  dictate their price.""  Importantly, however, FERC also states that, ""ISO has no more or less ability  to procure capacity and energy than any other buyer of these services....if  the ISO is unable to elicit sufficient supplies at or below its announced  purchase price ceiling (because generators are free to sell elsewhere if they  choose), it will have to raise its purchase price to the level necessary to  meet its needs.""  [Emphasis added]  FERC then notes that this may lead to an  increase in Out of Market (""OOM"") calls and that OOM calls are not subject to  a maximum purchase price.  Also, with regard to the ISO's resolution stating that generators must bid  their capacity into the ISO markets when system load exceeds 38,000 MW, FERC  states clearly that, ""such a requirement is not permitted by our November  12  Order and the ISO tariff.""  [Emphasis added]  FERC goes on to say that any requirement to sell to ISO in conjunction with a  maximum purchase price would require significant revisions to ISO's market  rules, which could not be made effective without a corresponding amendment to  ISO's tariff.  This would require 60 days' advance notice, ""and could not be  implemented prior to Commission approval.  As stated above, our November 12  Order was clearly based on the premise that the proper response to inadequate  supply (due to a low maximum purchase price) is to raise the maximum purchase  price.""  ISO is then ""put on notice that any amendment to mandate sales must be  accompanied by a demonstration that this extreme measure is the proper  response to low supplies in the ISO markets.""  Concurrences were filed by Commissioners Massey and Hebert.  Massey suggests  that the state has to facilitate solutions to market issues, such as risk  management tools, removing constraints on hedging opportunities, introducing  real time pricing through real time metering and expediting approval of new  generation and transmission projects in California.  Hebert says that the  previous November Order tried to ""straddle the fence"" and that, ""Today, the  Commission at least starts to lean slightly in the right direction of  recognizing that we have a role.""  He then reiterates his preference for  removing all price caps.  He also suggests that, ""Getting to the bottom of  the problem, in my view, requires us to begin a proceeding to rescind our  approval of the ISO as operator of the California grid.  The record supports  such a move.""  He refers approvingly to the Collins resignation letter,  stating that it, ""thoughtfully outlines consequences to the market of a  return to 'command and control.' ""  Hebert states that, ""The independence of  the ISO's governing structure stands threatened.  We should 'stand up,' to  quote the resignation letter.""  Hebert advocates opening a section 206  proceeding now, as part of the recently announced inquiry into bulk power  markets, ""including the California markets.""  This decision makes it clear that ISO cannot lower the caps at tomorrow's  meeting and expect that sellers will be required to sell to it at that  price.  This is an important development and very good news in our ongoing  efforts to seek economic sanity at the ISO.  Please call if you have any questions.

The measure, if passed by the Assembly and signed by the governor, would  reduce bills to the level San Diego Gas & Electric Co. customers were paying  in July 1999. While customer payments would be cut in half, however, SDG&E  ratepayers could be liable in several years for the balance.  The credit to consumers would hinge on a finding of improper overcharges by  power companies.  The rollback-and-reimbursement measure -- carried by two San Diego Democrats,  Sen. Dede Alpert and Assemblywoman Susan Davis -- sailed out of the Senate  with support from 24 Democrats and four Republicans.  All three of the Republicans who represent parts of San Diego County voted  for the bill. The 27th vote needed for two-thirds approval of the urgency  measure came from Sen. Bill Morrow, R-Oceanside.  ""We have a dysfunctional market that is not working and has been just so  incredibly painful for the people I represent,"" Alpert told the Senate. ""We  need your help. We need it now.""  San Diego is the first area of the state fully affected by deregulation  legislation enacted four years ago. But other areas will be deregulated  within two years, and legislators do not want soaring rates in their  districts.  A vote on the Alpert-Davis bill in the Assembly was delayed for at least a  week because of potential opposition from Republicans. Gov. Gray Davis, who  is proposing a similar reduction that would not be retroactive to June 1, has  taken no position on the bill.  ""It's important to keep this bill moving along,"" said Morrow, who said he  struggled with the vote because the bill does nothing to speed up the  construction of new power plants.  The bill, AB 2290, would cut rates to the July 1, 1999, level and make the  reduction retroactive to June 1 of this year. State and federal regulatory  agencies would be asked to determine if San Diego ratepayers have been  improperly overcharged.  In the years ahead, San Diego ratepayers could be reimbursed for high rates  paid this summer through a credit that would lower their monthly bills -- but  only if the investigation finds an improper overcharge and that repayment can  be collected from those responsible.  Alpert said the cost of the credit could be born by energy generators for  overcharging, SDG&E for failing to make cheaper energy purchases, and the  state and federal government for not protecting ratepayers.  ""I don't think anybody believes anybody is going to be 100 percent  responsible for this,"" Alpert said.  The governor Wednesday asked the Public Utilities Commission to meet Aug. 21  and reduce rates for SDG&E customers by half, dropping a typical residential  bill from the current level of $120 a month to $65.  The governor's plan is similar to the Alpert-Davis bill, but it's not  retroactive to June 1 and would take effect this month. Critics of the  governor's plan doubt that an investigation will result in the recovery of an  overcharge from generators, marketers or SDG&E.  Nettie Hoge, executive director of The Utility Reform Network, said that what  Davis has proposed is likely to be not a true rate reduction, but simply a  plan to spread the payment of high rates over several years.  ""San Diegans can't afford a pay now and pay later scheme,"" Hoge said. ""They  are in the midst of an economic and public health crisis.""  The Alpert-Davis bill needs at least six Republican votes for approval in the  Assembly. Alpert said two Assembly Republicans representing parts of San  Diego, Charlene Zettel of Poway and Pat Bates of Laguna Niguel, support the  bill and are listed as co-authors.  She hopes to get support from three other San Diego County Republicans: Steve  Baldwin of El Cajon, Howard Kaloogian of Encinitas and Bruce Thompson of  Fallbrook.  Assembly GOP Leader Scott Baugh of Huntington Beach said the bill should be  heard in committees, rather than simply put up for a vote on the house floors  without public hearings.  ""To just ram through a rate rollback, a rate freeze and a rate reimbursement  does nothing to address the underlying problems that created the energy  shortage,"" he said.  Baugh said he would like a discussion of the contention by some that rebate  checks that began going out to SDG&E customers this week will solve much of  the problem this year.  He said standby generators could be built within six months to provide power  in periods of peak demand to protect San Diegans from high rates next summer.  The rebate checks are a $390 million refund for overcharges related to  deregulation and amount to $260 for the average household. An additional $100  million refund will take the form of a credit on bills for August and  September, totaling $34 for the typical residence.  At a legislative committee hearing on deregulation, Sen. Steve Peace, D-El  Cajon, clashed with Loretta Lynch, president of the Public Utilities  Commission. He said the refund checks only go to residences and small  businesses, not medium-sized businesses hurt by high rates.     Copyright 2000 Union-Tribune Publishing Co.

"I agree that it is difficult to stomach the idea of supporting a rate cap and  don't  believe we should.  However, a rate cap will not necessarily kill our  value proposition in CA.  From a product standpoint, a rate cap will push us  back to a ""discount off of frozen tariff"" product as we will be able to  offfer some discount based on the shoulder months (assuming there are any  left) and based on how long the rate cap lasts.  As you are aware, this is  the most successful product we have had in CA.  and customers are comfortable  with it.  If the caps last long enough, we can go past the rate freeze period  and offer pretty good discounts.  Additionally, customers will probably want  to see this product post rate freeze based on this summer.  Additionally, a  rate cap will probably benefit our risk management folks through next summer.  Please don't misinterpret this message.  I believe we need to continue to  oppose the caps.  In my opinion, this is the slippery slope of re-regulation  that opens the door to massive uncertainty that we cannot hedge.  But, based  on the current political climate, it appears that they are inevitable.  IF  they occur, it is not the end of our ESP business.  As always, we continue to  adapt to the political wrangling that seems to occur daily.  Please call me if you wish to discuss this further.  Thanks.

SDG&E Rate Stabilization Plan  CPUC voted 5-0 to approve the Rate Ceiling Plan that implements AB 265 signed yesterday by Governor Davis.  The Plan basically tracks the language of AB 265 by establishing a ceiling of 6.5 cents per kWh per month on the electricity rate component of bills for residential, small commercial and lighting customers.  The class of small commercial customers, as defined in AB 265, also include all SDG&E customers on Rate Schedule A, general acute care hospitals, K-12 public and private schools, and all SDG&E customers on Schedule AL-TOU under 100 kW.  The Plan is retroactive to June 1, 2000, extends through December 31, 2002 and is effective immediately though it can be extended for another year if the public interest calls for an extension.  SDG&E is required to record any revenue shortfalls to a balancing account within the TCBA with any net revenues generated from SDG&E-owned or managed generation assets to be used to offset any undercollections that result.  In addition, AB 265 charged the CPUC with setting up a voluntary program for large commercial, agricultural and industrial customers who procure energy from SDG&E so that these customers may elect to cap the electricity rate component at the 6.5 cents ceiling, with a true-up after a year.  The CPUC is giving parties 15 days from today's decision to file comments on this provision with reply comments due 15 days after the comments are due.  Moreover, the CPUC also ordered that the investigation into the electric market opened by the August 3 OII be broadened specifically to address the issues raised in Assembly Joint Resolution (AJR) 77.  AJR 77 emphasized the need to review ""the options for correcting the electricity market, methods to eliminate price volatility for consumers and methods of cost recovery and cost allocation.""  Lastly, AB 265 also orders an investigation into the prudence and reasonableness of SDG&E's procurement of wholesale electric energy beginning on June 1, 2000.  Based on its findings, the CPUC is authorized to take action on behalf of SDG&E customers, including, but not limited to, refunds.  No public comments were made on this matter.  The Commissioners' comments were basically limited to statements such as the Legislature and the Governor have spoken, and we are bound to implement AB 265 immediately.  RAP '99  No big surprise here, this was held to the next meeting.  SDG&E Bilateral Contracts Authority  Held to next meeting.  Other Energy Matters  Most of the energy Resolutions were held over to the next meeting such as SCE's master-metering request, PG&E's request to modify its Price Responsiveness Load Program (E-BID) and PG&E's request to file a new tariff, OBMC-Optional Binding Mandatory Curtailment Plan.

Lehr Subject: You should look at this   ?    By Nigel Hunt  ?? LOS  ANGELES, Sept 7 (Reuters) - The cap on wholesale power prices in  California  could be cut for the third time this year, this time to $100 per  megawatt hour  after starting the year at $750 per MWh.  ?? The  state's Electricity Oversight Board (EOB) is to make a request to the  California  Independent System Operator (ISO) within the next few days on the  issue  following a resolution by the state's lawmakers last week.  ?? ""We will  make a formal request within the next few days,"" EOB Executive  Director Gary  Heath said.  ?? An  assembly joint resolution approved last week called on the EOB to  direct the ISO  to ""show cause why the price caps in the ancillary services  and real-time energy  markets should not be lowered to $100 per megawatt-hour  immediately and continue  until at least March 31, 2001.""  ?? The cap  currently stands at $250 per MWh after previous cuts from $750 to  $500 and $500  to $250 amid growing consumer unrest about skyrocketing  electricity bills and  allegations of possible price gouging by generators.  ?? The  assembly resolution says the EOB should report back to the  legislature by  December 1, 2000.  ?? There was  heavy criticism of the ISO, which controls most of the state's  power grid, by  lawmakers this year at its governing board twice rejected  resolution to cut the  cap to $250 from $500 before finally agreeing to such  a move.  ?? Heath  noted the EOB at a meeting last week decided not to approve the  appointment or  reappointment of 13 members of the ISO board and 12 members  of the California  Power Exchange's governing board.  ?? ""We are  trying to place people who are a bit more mindful of the  implications of board  decisions on Californian consumers,"" Heath said.  ?? Existing  board members will remain in office until replacements can be  appointed.  ?? Heath  said that some individuals who were rejected may eventually be  approved and the  EOB was rather making a statement about the performance of  the two boards.  ?? ""The  board was making a very clear statement that we are not satisfied  with the the  efforts of the ISO or PX governing boards to proect Californian  consumers,""  Heath said.  ?? Wholesale  power prices in California soared to record levels during a  heatwave in June and  many customers in San Diego faced a tripling in their  electricity bills.  ? Supporters of  cutting the cap believe the power market is not ""workably  competitive"" and  prices rose to excessive levels during the heatwave,  putting an unfair burden on  both ratepayers and shareholders of investor  owned utilities.  ?? Opponents  have been led by independent power producers who have argued a  lower cap could  make it more difficult for the state to import power at  times of shortage.  ??

"Tim always tells me EPMI's biggest problem about accessing transmission with  the ISO is the lack of public information.  Tim wants all ISO information -  as he says ""more, better, faster.""  In other words he wants: meter and outage  information, water levels, bids and schedules, actual flows, transmission  availability and congestion.    Making this information available is necessary for three reasons.  This  information would help the market to police itself and provide better price  signals producing a more efficient market.  It would remove competitive  advantages held by monopsony load servers and generators owning a large  percentage of the generation in the market.  It would also, as Sue points  out, remove the transmission availability knowledge advantage held by the  grandfathered transmission contract holders.

I'll take a shot in answering your questions, Steve. Others are free to  comment as well.  The transmission issues in the ISO are greatly lessened.  If you talk to the  traders, they LOVE it.  Before April1, 1998, they had no sales to CA.  Now,  they have millions of dollars of sales.  Why?  -- no transmission access to  speak of before the ISO took over.  We still have some problems, however.  The problems have been there since day  one and FERC has punted on them.  We have a huge FERC case dealing with many  of them.  We also appealed a stupid FERC order on Path 15 probably at least a  year ago and have heard nothing from FERC on it. The traders have also  seriously considered a FERC complaint on Path 15.  So, what are the access issues?  Path 15 is the major constraint point between northern and southern CA.  Has  been for years. The transmission fix is basically adding a third intertie  line between Tracy and Tesla. When I left PG&E in 1996, the estimated coast  was $300 million.  The congestion costs did not justify building the line  then.  PG&E continues to control Path 15 and tells the ISO what's left after PG&E  allocates the capacity and decides what the rating is and when it changes.   There is no transparency.  PG&E has the ability to use Path 15 to advantage  Diablo Canyon given the existing contracts.  Carl has looked into it somewhat  and doesn't think PG&E is, but;... The ISO says it can't interpret PG&E's  contracts with the munis and filed some funky thing with FERC about how it's  some kind of overseer -- we protested and have now appealed.  The munis have  been receiving preferential access since Day One -- their contracts were  generally subservient to the IOU rights -- more like interruptible -- but  once the ISO started, all of a sudden, the muni rights became super firm  superceding the IOU rights (as far as we can tell from sketchy filings and  discussions with ISO staff). That's why we have pushed the issue.  Also,  Dynegy and Power Exchange (not the PX) have rights on Path 15.  Tim Belden  would love to get some info on how that constaint is being operated.  Information in general is pretty sketchy on real-time transmission.  We have  complained to the ISO about how the ISO knows what's going on in transmission  (as do the utilities), changes what it does, which then changes prices, and  then doesn't tell us until after the fact.  The ISO has promised to do  better, but I don't think has implemented any real changes yet.  Advantageous access.  Except for what's going on in Path 15, I don't think the IOUs have any  advantages on access -- except with respect to Regulatory Must Run resources  like nuclear and hydro -- but I think it's resource specific, rather than  owner specific. The munis are another story.  See next item.  Munis Preference  This is a huge issue here and I assume across the country.  In making a  devil's bargain with the munis, the FERC has put the ISO into an untenable  situation.  The ""sanctity of contracts"" under any and all conditions has  created preference for incumbents (not the IOUs -- but everyone who had a  transmission contract with the IOUs) and poor rights for those poor schlepps  like us who have come into the new market.  The ISO cannot operate the system  this way and is forced to give the munis/Dynegy more than they had originally  and to let them do things no one else can do (e.g., some munis get to change  their schedule after the actrive hour begins, some get to do it every half  hour, so far most haven't had to pay for ancillary services, etc.)   There are many, many examples of how we are discriminated against (in  addition to Path 15) and of how FERC has shined us on -- but yet we fight on.  The most recent muni giveaway is the litigation surrounding the ""new""  transmission charge for CA -- into this has been entangled the rules for  munis joining the ISO.  The munis want huge handouts to join. And part of the  ""new"" T rate includes hundreds of millions of subsidies for munis -- I've  pointed out that this amounts to the IOU's customers paying for the munis'  stranded transmission costs, when they are already paying for the IOUs'  stranded generation costs, but this argument fell on deaf ears in the ISO.

IBM would be interested in receiving a report from this event.  We would also like to discuss potential impacts/options for our CA sites.  Thanks.   The ISO will be hosting a Participating Load Stakeholder meeting on September 20, 2000 at the ISO.  The meeting is a broad stakeholder meeting to help refine our load participation programs for 2001. Much of the day will be committed to presentations and discussions on lessons learned from 2000 and proposals for 2001, including technical standards, contractual issues, and load management.            Some vendors have approached the ISO with systems that would aggregate loads, give them an opportunity to curtail based on day ahead energy prices, and provide the curtailment instructions and verifications. This type of program may be ultimately sold to ESPs or IOUs. In order to accelerate the testing of such systems the ISO may sponsor a pilot program to test the system/approach with selected vendors.  The pilot program will test the concepts, the interfaces, and assist in bringing together vendors, ESPs, SCs, and the IOUs as we move forward toward improving demand responsiveness in our markets.  We have reserved about 1 -2 hours in the afternoon, to allow 3-4 vendors to present their approaches to the stakeholder group.            In addition, we welcome you to visit a vendor fair that the ISO is hosting on September 21, 2000.  The ISO has      experienced considerable interest from the market place in such a vendor fair that would include entities providing Data Processing Gateway technology for both Generators and Loads in the Participating Ancillary Services Load Program. This effort is being encouraged to develop multiple solutions pertaining to installations of direct telemetry for Generators and Load providing Ancillary Services to the ISO markets.            The agendas are attached for both events, including directions and lodging information.           Please RSVP by September 13, 2000 to Sue Happ at shapp@caiso.com.

"Here's what I have:  I'm sure I'm on time in some time zone somewhere.  Tim  Belden is due back from vacation on Monday.  The West desk would not give me  any valuation estimates until Tim returned.  EES  PTR, Phase I   Enron was the only party that raised the issue of the UDCs imposing an  artificial cap on the PX credit for direct customers (RAP '98).  The CPUC  shined us on. Later, we ensured that it became part of ARM's case in PTR  Phase I. The way the ""cap"" worked, the UDCs would not pay ESPs the full PX  credit when prices were high -- they would pay a credit that, when added to  the other bill components, did not exceed the frozen rate for the direct  access customer, thereby costing ESPs potentially a lot of  money.  It was  clear in the previous CPUC direct access decisions that UDCs had no right to  cap direct access credits. Because of our good case and the fact that the  UDCs believed the chance of such high PX prices was LOW, the UDCs settled  with ARM on this issue in 1999.  2000 NPV estimated by Dennis Benevides: $30 - 40 million % Attributed to Enron's Efforts: 90%  Green Credit Legislation Enron and other green suppliers began work in 1998 to extend the credit given  for sales of green power. The credit was scheduled to end by 2002. In 1999,  the money specified in AB 1890 was being depleted rapidly and Green Mountain  took the lead in pressing for legislation. We actively supported Green  Mountain by lobbying legislators and other interest groups, working with  envrionmental organizations, and spearheading legislative amendments.   Although this bill became wrapped up in the San Diego crisis and ISO/PX  issues, the green credit portion of the bill remained intact.  We had also  decided jointly to propose a ten-year credit and were very pleased and  surprised that it survived into the final bill.  Governor Davis is expected  to sign the bill.   2000 NPV estimated by Dennis Benevides: $50 million % Attributed to Enron's Efforts: 25%  RAP '99 Enron, through ARM, has successfully made its case that retail procurement  and retail sales costs should be removed from the Distribution Charge that  all customers pay.  Direct Access customers would receive a credit on their  bills in addition to the PX credit. Enron was the first party to raise these  issues as part of RAP '98 and got a Commission decision in that case to  determine the credit in RAP '99.  In RAP '99, Enron chose to use ARM to  litigate the case as a cheaper alternative.  Hearings were completed in the  Spring of 2000.  ARM has negotiated settlement rates with certain parties and  has convinced the Assigned Commissioner to draft his own decision to  counteract the unfavorable ALJ decision. An additional credit of from $0.25  to $0.30/MWh is expected.  The decision will be voted out within the next two  months.  2000 NPV estimted by Dennis Benevides: $1 - 5 million % Attributed to Enron's Efforts: 75%  ECT  FTR Release April 1, 2000 I have spearheaded the release of firm transmission rights in CA since I  joined the Company in 11/96.  Our long and painful fight with creeping  nodalism culminated with the release of some, but not all, FTRs in April of  this year.  ENA actively participated in the auction and became the largest  single purchaser of FTRs.  The new congestion management approach, which  Enron also spearheaded, will require 100% release of FTRs, but will not take  effect until next year. This valuation looks only at the FTR release in 2000.  2000 NPV estimated by Tim Belden: To be determined 9/17/00 % Attributed to Enron's Efforts: 90%   ISO Price Caps ENA was long in the market in the West and had millions at risk when lower  price caps began to be discussed in CA in mid June.  Government Affairs,  working with Dave Parquet and others, was instrumental in significantly  delaying the movement to lower price caps, thereby giving ENA time to move  out of those positions.  The following events happened in 2000.  We entered  the year with a price cap of $750, having fought to raise it to that level in  1999.  In March 2000, the ISO considered lowering the price cap to $500 but  voted to leave it at $500, because they believed at the time that market  power had been adequately mitigated.  After the four very high-priced days in  June, the ISO considered lowering the price cap to $250 with a vote on June  22, but the vote failed by ONE VOTE. Instead, the Board lowered the price cap  to $500.  The Board voted again on July 1 to lower the cap and again the vote  failed by ONE VOTE.  Finally, on August 1, the Board approved the $250 price  cap, effective August 7.  In June, Government Affairs intitiated an all-out  lobbying effort to convince Board members and their constituents to oppose  lower price caps.  We also lobbied interest groups, banks, venture  capitalists, NYMEX and others to weigh in on this issue with individual Board  Members and the Board itself, going so far as to set up a special arrangement  with the ISO staff to allow interested parties to address the Board  telephonically.   2000 NPV estimated by Tim Belden: To be determined 9/17/00 % Attributed to Enron's Efforts: 80%   New Market-Oriented Board Member The ISO recently held Board elections for the first time.  Government Affairs  actively sought market-oriented individuals to run for the Board and replace  those that do not support competitive markets.  Enron was successful in  getting about five to run.  The Members selected or confrmed by the EOB have  been held up and we do not yet know the outcome of those Board seats.   However, one seat of interest has been decided.  Dave Parquet suggested a  potential municipal representative who was extremely market-oriented (Michael  Wood, City Attorney for the City of Pittsburgh).  Government Affairs worked  with him closely to decide which seat to run for, help him prepare his  application, suggest lobbying tactics, assist in lobbying and support him  with other Board Members.  He won the election and became a Board Member in  early September.  This effort is significant, because the munis voted nearly  100% in support of lower price caps. The position he took was one of those  votes.  All other things being equal, we have now added a vote on our side  that could be instrumental in defeating further efforts to impose lower or  additional price caps, given the close votes that have taken place thus far.  2000 NPV estimated based on Tim Belden's Pice Cap Assessment: To be  determined 9/17/00 % Attibuted to Enron's Efforts: 100%  ","john.neslage@enron.com, gia.maisashvili@enron.com, james.steffes@enron.com,   harry.kingerski@enron.com",susan.mara@enron.com,Sue's Valuation,2000-09-15 19:51:00-07:00,sent

"PG&E is trying to rewrite history.  As I mentioned, the following Advice  Letter requests that the CPUC value hydro at $2.8 billion versus $1 billion  effective June 28, 2000.  We are concerned that the purpose of this maneuver  is so that PG&E can claim the rate freeze had ended at the end of June and  that they can pass on the high cost of energy beginning July to retail  customers versus incurring the shareholder risks. I'm almost surprised PG&E  didn't claim the value effective June 12 -- the day before the high prices  began.  This is disgusting.  PG&E has absolutely no shame!  We'll be making  an all-out effort to keep this from happening.  Hope we can work together.

Cal ISO Amendment 30        ? Alliance RTO Filing  Two issues arose on the weekly conference call today on which we need your  assistance and feedback.  Please forward comments to Julie Simon at  202-789-7200 or jsimon@epsa.org by close of business on Monday, September  25th.  1. Cal ISO Amendment 30  On September 11, 2000 the Cal ISO filed Amendment No. 30 to its ISO Tariff at  FERC.  In this filing, the Cal ISO is ""reluctantly"" asking FERC for authority  to buy forward contracts to meet its real-time balancing obligations.  Costs  of the forward contracts would be allocated to Scheduling Coordinators who  deviate in real time from their schedules.  Interventions and protests are  due on October 2nd.  While EPSA has consistently opposed an ISO role as market participant, there  are concerns here about the lack of alternatives available in California.   While an ISO's role in the real-time balancing market should be small, as a  practical matter, the Cal ISO has been forced to procure thousands of  megawatts in the real time markets.  Thus, deciding how to approach this  filing balances difficult competing goals.  Please let us know how you would  like EPSA to proceed.  2. Alliance RTO  On September 15th the Alliance RTO made a compliance filing at FERC seeking  to address all of FERC's concerns about its earlier proposals and purporting  to meet all the requirements of Order No. 2000.  The filing retains a transco  structure, with a 5 percent ownership limitation for individual market  participants and a 15 percent ownership limitation on each class of market  participants.  It also eliminates pancaked rates in favor of zonal, or  license plate, rates for deliveries within the Alliance and postage-rates for  through or out deliveries.  While the geographic scope is unchanged, the  scope will be larger than any operating RTO.  The filing includes a pro-forma  inter-RTO coordination agreement to address seams issues such as security  coordination, market monitoring, regional planning ATC and TTC calculations  and pricing reciprocity.  Until now, EPSA has not been a party to the Alliance proceeding.  With this  latest filing it may be appropriate for EPSA to intervene, raising issues of  support or opposition to the filing.  To determine how to proceed, however,  we need input from those companies that have been more closely involved in  the development of the Alliance.  Please let us know how EPSA should proceed  with respect to this latest filing.

California Utilities' Losses                    On Electricity Pose Risk                     By REBECCA SMITH                     Staff Reporter of THE WALL STREET JOURNAL                     California's two biggest utilities are losing so much  money buying electricity                    in the state's deregulated market that they have run up  deficits equivalent to                    half their net worth in just four months.                     If the cost of wholesale power continues to exceed the  price these utilities                    are allowed to bill their customers, as currently seems  likely, they could                    become technically insolvent sometime next year. That  would put pressure                    on regulators to orchestrate a multibillion-dollar public  bailout, similar to                    the ""too big to fail'' response that in the past pushed  governments to rescue                    banks.                     Such a scenario is quietly being discussed by bond-rating  concerns that                    recently reduced their credit outlooks for Pacific Gas &  Electric Co., a unit                    of San Francisco-based PG&E Corp., and Southern California  Edison, a                    unit of Edison International of Rosemead, Calif. Bond-  rating concerns say                    they aren't sure how much additional debt can be borne by  the two                    affected utilities before they will have difficulty paying  their bills.                                          ""If this is just a seasonal  aberration, the utilities                                         can get through it,"" says Lori  Woodland,                                         analyst for Fitch IBCA. ""If it goes  on for six or                                         nine months, it's a very serious  situation.""                                         Adds A.J. Sabatelle, senior credit  officer at                                         Moody's Investors Service Inc.: ""At  some                                         point, you have a financial crisis.""                                          The utilities say they are having no  difficulty                                         meeting expenses and don't envision  problems                                         in servicing their debts. But they  are vigorously                    lobbying state and federal regulators to change the rules  of the game,                    hoping somehow to raise rates to make up for the  shortfall. The California                    utilities' experience may be a harbinger of what could  happen in other                    states where wholesale power prices have surpassed the  amount that                    utilities are allowed to charge their ratepayers.                     For now, utilities are making ends meet by going to the  financial markets to                    borrow money. PG&E, a giant utility that serves one out of  every 20                    Americans, is seeking approval to increase its debt  capacity by $1.4                    billion. It is borrowing $200 million, while Edison is  tapping $250 million                    from the commercial paper market. ""This is going to be a  long, tough                    road,"" says Jim Scilacci, chief financial officer for  Southern California                    Edison.                     Today's situation represents a complete turnabout from  what was expected                    when California deregulated its energy market on March 31,  1998, which                    opened electricity pricing to competition. California  tried to give its utilities                    a competitive edge nationally by deregulating faster than  other states and                    by creating a mechanism to allow investor-owned utilities,  such as PG&E                    and Edison, to quickly pay down debts incurred to serve  customers under                    the old regulatory system.                     To do this, the state legislature set                    retail rates at high levels, which, at                    first, generated fat surpluses for the                    utilities. As the money piled up,                    utilities used it to pay down debts for                    generation facilities that were                    otherwise unprofitable in the new                    deregulated world. By the end of this                    June, PG&E and Edison together                    had collected more than $12 billion                    and were on track to finish paying                    down debts well ahead of the March                    31, 2002, deadline set by the                    legislature. At that point, rate freezes                    were to end and retail prices were to                    fluctuate with the market.                     But all that went out the window in June, when wholesale  power prices                    surged, topping the rates the utilities were allowed to  charge retail                    customers. Average prices at state-sanctioned energy  markets were four                    to five times the prices of a year earlier, and three to  four times the level                    utilities could charge customers.                     The accumulated shortfall has been so enormous at PG&E,  that analysts                    expect its deficit to exceed $3 billion by Oct. 31, more  than half its                    shareholder equity of $5.7 billion, which is defined as  assets minus                    liabilities. Southern California Edison finished August  with a deficit of $2                    billion, equivalent to almost two-thirds its net worth of  $3.2 billion. The                    utilities, though they have been accumulating deficits,  aren't required to                    report these as losses on their earnings statements.                     That leaves utilities in a bind. They want to end the rate  freeze to be able to                    pass on the real cost of electricity to consumers. But  should the freeze end                    before the statutory deadline of 2002, they get clobbered.  That is because                    they will immediately have to book a loss on their  power-purchase deficits.                    What's more, they can't use the proceeds from planned  power-plant sales                    to cover those losses; instead, should the freeze end,  they will be obliged                    to refund some of the proceeds to ratepayers. In PG&E's  case, the refunds                    could total $500 million, while in Edison's case, the  amount is $254 million.                     Publicly at least, utility executives insist a mechanism  will be found to let                    them recoup the money spent on electricity.                     Consumer advocates are gearing up for the fight. Nettie  Hoge, executive                    director for San Francisco consumer group Utility Reform  Network, says                    ratepayers shouldn't end up footing the bill for a deal  cut by utilities that                    benefited them before prices shot up.                     Utility executives are now distancing themselves from the  legislation that                    got them into such a mess, which was drafted with their  assistance. PG&E                    Chairman Robert Glynn says it is best not to ""overanalyze""  the ""old deal.""                    Instead, he says, regulators and legislators should sit  down with utilities and                    construct a new agreement, since ""it's in the broad  interests of the state not                    to have critical energy infrastructure look like a leper.""                     Mr. Glynn says the current deal offers ""mutually assured  destruction"" to                    both utilities and ratepayers. Something must be done, he  says, or                    consumers throughout most of the state will experience ""a  San Diego-style                    rate shock."" The utility serving that city, San Diego Gas  & Electric Co.,                    ended its freeze a year ago and began passing wholesale  power costs                    directly through to ratepayers. Legislators intervened  this summer,                    however, and temporarily capped retail rates when monthly  power bills                    nearly tripled. The utility, a unit of Sempra Energy, is  also accumulating a                    deficit as a result.                     So long as banks and bond markets believe the utilities  will be repaid, they                    will be able to borrow, analysts say. ""Until we hear  politicians of                    consequence state otherwise, our position is that we  believe the utilities will                    be made whole,"" says Richard Cortright, a director at  Standard & Poor's                    corporate ratings group.                     But that opinion could change if it looks like the  utilities will have to                    swallow a big loss. The result: lower credit ratings that  would raise                    borrowing costs and could trigger a downward spiral.  ""You're talking                    about top-rated companies, though,"" said Ms. Woodland of  Fitch IBCA.                    ""To get to insolvency, a lot would have to happen.""                     In the meantime, utilities are doing all they can to  control the hemorrhaging.                    They have gotten authority from regulators to buy more  power under                    long-term contracts at fixed prices, reducing their  vulnerability to                    spot-market volatility. And they have petitioned federal  regulators to                    declare California's market so badly flawed that  generators should be                    denied market pricing and, even, ordered to pay refunds.                     Nevertheless, several forces are working against them.  Although they can                    sign bilateral contracts, prices remain high for those as  well. What's more,                    they can't buy less power than their customers need. If  they don't buy                    enough, the California Independent System Operator, the  organization                    responsible for reliability, will step in and make  purchases for them and                    send them the bill.                     Perhaps the biggest problem facing PG&E and Edison,  though, is one of                    timing. The California legislature is out of session until  December, and                    regulators haven't even really started to address the  issue formally. In the                    meantime, the utilities' deficit is growing by tens of  millions of dollars daily.

"WPTF has just voted to file a protest on Amendment 30 (the ISO is asking to  be able to buy power for itself in the forward market).  I agreed to fund as  did 4, maybe 5, others.  The discussion was not exactly as you describe below  but I will be able to have lots of input on the filing, and am sure I can get  the points included.  Therefore, I recommend that Enron NOT make a separate  filing on this.  Here is what WPTF voted on:  Ask FERC to limit ISO procurement only to the  super peak product that has already been developed by the APX and require  that the price caps end in 6 months; if the ISO wishes to renew the price  caps it would have to file 60 days in advance of the 6-month deadline.

If not we need to have Ron give an estimate for an RCR  and draft a protest.  Amendment 30, which would allow the Cal ISO to do limited forward contracting  and to allocate the costs thereof to under/overschedulers (protests due  Oct.2)the traders would like to say that the ISO should not be in the forward  market, rather the IOUs should be in the forward market and should be  incented to do so.  Rather than doing anything to fix this failure to hedge  and underscheduling by the IOUs, this filing would further amplify the  problem by concentrating even more transactions with the ISO and lead to the  slippery slope to the ISO running the entire market.    Since, the filing also creates other problems.

"SUBJECT TO ATTORNEY CLIENT PRIVILEGE  Mary,  As you requested, this e-mail is to report on the WPTF discussions on the  CPUC subpoenas.  In a Board conference call today, the members discussed who had subpoenas and  a bit about what they were doing to respond. New West received a subpoena,   but not its parent Salt River.  APX did not receive one.  (Separately, I  learned that New Energy hasn't found one yet, though its parent AES got one)  Joe Paul of Dynegy took the lead and said that the generators had been having  a weekly conference call to coordinate.  They had negotiated with the CPUC to  get the Protective Order that came out last week.    I suggested that the people receiving last Friday's subpoenas work toether  the same way.  Dan Douglas (WPTF's attorney) will send an e-mail out asking  the interested members to contact me.  Joe said that the issues they have seen are:  whether to file a motion to  quash, what jurisdiction the CPUC has, what information should be shared, as  well as other PR and legal issues.  He felt that ESP and SC issues may be  quite different from generaters and suggested we work together.  The  Generators have already given some public data tothe CPUC.  He says Dynegy is  likely to argue that this type of analysis should not be done by the CPUC,  but by the Market Surveillance Committee or someone of that ilk.

Hoecker also urged the congressmen  to give the commission broader authority to sufficiently oversee the utility  industry's transition to competition.  Hoecker's plea to Congress may not be a welcomed one for California, where  some state officials want the commission to order refunds to customers after  prices in the wholesale market skyrocketed to unprecedented levels this  summer. Although Hoecker has informed California that the commission will  consider refunds as a part of its larger investigation into the state's bulk  power markets, it is clear that currently, the commission does not have that  authority to do so retroactively.  ""The [Federal Power Act] would have to be changed,"" a FERC staffer says.  For its own study -- which began in August -- Hoecker claimed that the  commission, if proven necessary, would consider ordering refunds if market  participants were indeed price gouging. However, the Federal Power Act (FPA)  -- the law that gives the commission much of its authority -- does not  consider retroactive refund authority and clarification of that law is  probably needed to see if the commission can do that.  ""If we need to fix market rules or market structures within our jurisdiction,  we will do so,"" Hoecker told the House Committee on Government Reform Sept.  21. ""If market power is being exercised, we will respond accordingly, by  revoking or modifying market-based rates or reassuring the basis upon which  we grant them. We may order refunds to the extent allowed by the FPA, if  refunds are justified by record evidence. However, the FPA defines the  commission's authority, and leaves responsibility for many helpful measures  with California (and other states).""  Currently, the FPA allows the commission to issue refunds for transactions  made 60 days after the commission initiates an investigation, which in this  case would be Oct. 13. However, the law makes no mention of retroactive  ratemaking, and FERC officials admit that to do so, the law needs to be  changed.  ""Based upon what I know, the authority of the commission to issue refunds for  any period before 60 days following our [investigation] order is highly  problematic,"" Commissioner William Massey (D) told Electric Power Alert.  ""There are very good arguments that if FERC would try to do that, it would be  unlawful and we would need legislation to do that.""  The Government Reform Committee, chaired by Rep. Dan Burton (R-IN), held a  mid-afternoon Sept. 21 hearing to gauge what is being predicted to be a  severe energy crisis this winter. The committee heard testimony from Hoecker,  Energy Secretary Bill Richardson, and Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)  Administrator Carol Browner.  Much of the hearing focused on natural gas and oil markets, but both  Richardson and Hoecker used the meeting as a forum to blast Congress for  failing to pass comprehensive restructuring legislation this year. Richardson  expressed his ""disappointment"" that nothing passed, while Hoecker claimed  that FERC needs broader authority if it is to guard against market power.  ""Congress should place all electric transmission in the continental United  States under the same rules for non-discriminatory open access and comparable  service,"" Hoecker said. ""The commission's open access rules are not binding  on the part of the nation's transmission system . . . owned or controlled by  entities other than public utilities. Open access over the facilities of  public power and other non-public utilities would promote greater competition  in wholesale markets, by expanding trading opportunities for wholesale buyers  and sellers.""  Hoecker pointed to FERC's investigation into bulk power markets and  California's energy crisis and claimed that unless the commission receives  clear legislative direction, FERC will extremely limited in what it could do  to solve the market problems.  ""Congress, too, has a role to play in ensuring that consumers are able to  obtain the energy they need at reasonable prices,"" Hoecker said. ""Most  critically, events this summer demonstrate the urgency of enacting  electricity legislation to help resolve remaining impediments to competition.  Federal legislation can establish the ground rules that will lead to adequate  investment in generation and transmission facilities, and higher levels of  reliability which is crucial to the digital economy.""  The chairman also urged Congress to give FERC the authority to mandate  regional transmission organization participation and mandate reliability  standards. Currently, the House is considering a bill that would make the  commission a federal backstop for reliability, but most congressional sources  do not expect the bill to pass (see related story).      _source: Electric Power Alert _date: October 2, 2000 _issue: Vol. 10, No. 20 _title: FERC's Hoecker Asks Congress For Broader Authority , Inside Washington Publishers    ","jeff.dasovich@enron.com, mona.petrochko@enron.com",susan.mara@enron.com,Chairman Hoecker's Congressional Testimony asking for retroactive  refund authority,2000-10-05 10:47:00-07:00,sent

""We are generally supportive of (the ISO's) procuring power in the forward  markets, but we want to make sure the ISO does that procurement through us  because it should be done in the market with the most liquidity,"" said CalPX  spokesman Jesus Arredondo.  In its filing with the FERC, CalPX said that experimentation with ""fledgling""  forward markets would place customers at risk for higher transactional costs  and might discourage the development of forward markets in California.  The ISO controls most of the state's power grid and real-time market, and the  CalPX is the spot market where electricity is bought and sold in the state.

LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--California's power costs surged this summer, not because of a supply shortage, but because power suppliers were able withhold generation until the last possible moment and command ""exorbitantly"" high prices, State Sen. Steve Peace said in a letter sent to federal regulators.  In the letter dated Oct. 3 and obtained by Dow Jones Newswires, the senator, one of the architects of deregulation in the state, charges that the state's power market was ""collusively structured"" and pleads with federal regulators to take action against instate generation owners for ""unlawful"" behavior.       Peace, D-Chula Vista, compared the state's power market to a World Wrestling Federation match, saying it only had the appearance of competition.       ""A WWF bout has all of the surface elements associated with competition, but the outcome is driven by a script rather than by the spontaneous consequences of competition,"" Peace says in the letter to Federal Energy Regulatory Chairman James Hoecker. ""Similarly, participants in the wholesale electric market are not responding to market signals, they are simply following a script written... to satisfy the most naive and simplistic believers in markets.""       The federal agency is expected to release its findings on the causes of the state's power crisis by December. State energy officials are conducting their own investigation of the summer's events, in which wholesale power prices spiked to record levels and power bills for San Diego customers tripled.       Peace wants FERC to order generators to repay hundreds of millions of dollars in power costs to California's retail electricity consumers and three-investor owned utilities.       State's Pwr Grid Operator Says Demand Outstripped Supply         Peace's claim that California didn't have an electricity supply problem this summer contradicts a report by the California Independent System Operator, the state's grid operator, which concluded that demand did outstrip supply.       ""These guys aren't in the control room,"" ISO spokesman Patrick Dorinson said of doubters in a previous interview. ""How would they know?""       If FERC uncovers evidence that California indeed faced no supply shortage this summer, the result could be severe penalties for all market participants, a FERC spokeswoman said.       The senator offered no such evidence in his letter, but said, ""In every case and in every declared emergency, supplies have been adequate to meet load.""       A conclusion that supply was short would leave FERC with little alternative but to return the market to cost-based rates until the supply shortage is corrected, the senator wrote.       The senator urged FERC not to conclude that the problems in the wholesale market would best be solved by eliminating the state's main power market, the CalPX, and moving to exclusively bilateral trade.       ""Such a result would be disastrous,"" Peace's letter states. ""The commission should keep in mind those who have manipulated the wholesale market are those who would prefer that all transactions be engaged in secret.""       But the senator did ask that the stakeholder boards of the CalPX and the ISO be replaced. In addition, the senator is reportedly drafting legislation that would fold the CalPX into the ISO and may result in the closure of the CalPX's Alhambra trading floor, sources close to the senator said.       CalPX spokesman Jesus Arredondo said the nonprofit exchange is operating exactly as the Legislature intended and that any overhaul would need the approval of the governor.       The California Municipal Utilities Association, a lobbying group representing the interests of about 30 municipal utilities in the state, filed a petition at FERC Wednesday seeking a temporary return to regulation in the form of cost-based rates. Pacific Gas & Electric Co. and Southern California Edison also plan on making similar filings with federal regulators by the end of the month.       -By Jason Leopold, Dow Jones Newswires; 323-658-3874; mailto:jason.leopold@dowjones.com       (MORE) Dow Jones Newswires 06-10-00       2115GMT     ","jeff.dasovich@enron.com, mona.petrochko@enron.com, sandra.mccubbin@enron.com,   james.steffes@enron.com",susan.mara@enron.com,Re: Mkt Manipulation Caused Calif Pwr Crisis - State Senator Peace,2000-10-09 11:43:00-07:00,sent

Mona (through  legal) has reviewed the site.  The purpose of the site is to provide commercial customers within certain  industries (restaurants, hotels, motels, hospitals, nursing homes, grocery  stores, convenience stores) the opportunity to purchase power from Enron.  At  this time, this isn't truly an ""online"" purchase.  The customer is sent a mailer directing them to the site and providing them a  unique customer ID and password.  When they arrive at the site, they will be  asked to enter customer contact information and basic energy usage  information for up to 5 meters and/or up to 2,000,000 kWh of aggregate  usage.  (The minimum usage size corresponds to the 20 kW per meter peak  demand.)  When the customer requests a price, the site is currently  configured to pull the price from the executable pricing matrix and fill-in a  contract.  The contract is then emailed to the customer within minutes (at  worst within 4 hours when the system is extremely busy).  The customer must  physically sign the contract and fax that back to Enron.  At that time, the  customer goes into the normal set -up and billing process.  The site is available 24 hours/day and 7 days/week unless the power desk  shuts it down during times when the desk is reaching it's open position  limits.  I've reserved several customer IDs for you.  Those are:  The password for each of these user IDs is ""begin"".  Keep in mind, we've set this up to protect ourselves against arbitrage risk.   If you enter a request for a price quote(s) under a particular user ID, you  cannot log in under that ID again until those quotes have expired (5PM CST  the next business day).  That's why I've given you so many user IDs.  I hope you'll have a chance to look at the site.  Please let me know if you  have any questions or comments.

"Word on the street is that the CA ISO staff is NOT asking for a vote on price  caps at the Board meeting on Thursday.  (I was speculating that the Board  would be asked to lower the price caps to $100 or to adopt the CEO's  proposal, which he filed at FERC on 10/20.)  The vote will be put off a vote  until late November.  No reason given -- but presumably so they don't look  like idiots if FERC comes out with something radically different on November  1.  But, I have also heard that one Board member -- Mike Florio of TURN -- has  asked for a vote on his proposal -- load-differentiated price caps (e. g.$250  when area load is 40,000 MW or more, $150 when load is between 30,000 and  40,000, etc.) If a few Board members, i.e., the utilities and some of the  munis gang up, they can force a vote.  I'm expecting one, but given the  staff's/CEO position, there may not be sufficient votes to go lower until  FERC comes out with its proposal.

DJ CalPX Responds To FERC, Denies It Worsened Power Prices  Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.     NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--The chief executive officer of the California Power  Exchange responded Tuesday to details in a federal energy regulatory report  that suggests the two-year-old exchange's mandatory buy requirement was  partly to blame for this past summer's soaring wholesale electricity prices.        The details of the landmark probe prepared by the Federal Energy  Regulatory Commission is scheduled to be released Wednesday morning, but some  commissioners told Dow Jones Newswires the report will suggest that the  state's mandatory buy rule should be abolished and utilities should be  permitted to purchase their power through other power exchanges.        ""We believe that the representation of the CalPX contributing to soaring  wholesale prices is incorrect and misleading,"" said CalPX CEO George Sladoje.        ""Over the summer months, certain wholesale market participants chose to  not take full advantage of the price and cost mitigating products offered  through the CalPX...if a participant chose to purchase all or most of their  energy on the spot market, they often paid much more than other participants  who chose to buy in the forwards market,"" Sladoje added.        It is widely known in the wholesale electricity market that Sempra  Energy (SRE) unit San Diego Gas & Electric Co. purchased most of their power  in the spot market, which the utility passed on to its customers at a much  higher price.        SDG&E also complained to federal regulators that the CalPX hourly and  day-ahead market clearing prices are too high.        When California moved to electricity deregulation four years ago, a  statewide power exchange was created requiring Edison International (EIX)  unit Southern California Edison, PG&E Corp. (PCG) unit Pacific Gas & Electric  Co. and San Diego Gas & Electric Co. to purchase all of their power through  the exchange until 2002, the expected transition date to a completely  deregulated market.        But the FERC report proposes that utilities be permitted to purchase  power from other exchanges in an effort to generate increased competition,  commissioners said.        The CalPX purchases power one day in advance for California's three  investor-owned utilities. Suppliers bid in power indicating their price. For  each hour of the next day, the price of the last megawatt taken to meet  demand sets the market price.        In various reports issued since 1996, FERC has commended the state's  Power Exchange for running a successful market that helped mitigate concerns  about market power abuses.        If the FERC report suggests that California end the mandatory buy  requirement, it will be up to state lawmakers to see to draft Legislation to  change the market rules, according to the CalPX.        -By Jason Leopold, Dow Jones Newswires; 323-658-3874;  mailto:jason.leopold@dowjones.com        (END) Dow Jones Newswires 31-10-00     ",jeff.dasovich@enron.com,susan.mara@enron.com,"Fwd: DJ - CalPX Responds To FERC, Denies It Worsened Power Prices",2000-11-01 06:18:00-08:00,sent

Most significantly,  Richardson said the Administration will likely send a proposed rule-making to  the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to establish mandatory  reliability standards for electricity * doing administratively what Congress  failed to accomplish this year.   ""California's electricity market has become dysfunctional -- and it's time to  make it right,"" said Secretary Richardson. ""More than once, California was  close to having blackouts rolling throughout the state. In San Diego,  residents and businesses saw their electric bills double almost overnight.  Consumers need an electricity system that is reliable and they should not be  facing this kind of price volatility.""   Richardson made the announcement in Sacramento this morning with California  Gov. Gray Davis.   Richardson said the Energy Department will take several initiatives to help  the reliability of California's electricity system and protect consumers from  dramatic price volatility, including:    Establish mandatory reliability standards for electricity * The Energy  Department will seek public comment on a proposed rulemaking that would  require utilities to follow mandatory rules to protect the reliability of the  electric grid in California and elsewhere. The Administration and others have  been pressing Congress to enact these much-needed rules to protect consumers.  The purpose of this rulemaking is to break the impasse in Congress and  authorize establishing the standards necessary to make electricity supplies  more reliable and energy markets more efficient;   Improve California's ability to import power * The Western Area Power  Administration, an Energy Department agency that co-owns a major substation  in Northern California, will provide $2 million to add a second transformer  there. This will help California bring in much-needed power from the Pacific  Northwest;   Provide millions to improve energy efficiency * The department is releasing a  half million dollars in grants to the California Energy Commission to support  programs that will make California buildings, which account for approximately  8 percent of all the energy used in buildings in the U.S., more energy  efficient. In addition to the $3.7 million the Energy Department has provided  the state this year to help weatherize 3,081 lower-income California  households, the department will provide $4.2 million next year to weatherize  homes and help lower the electricity bills of those that can least afford  high prices;   Work to add renewable sources * The department is working with the state and  local governments to help develop the tremendous renewable resources in  California, such as wind, solar, geothermal and biomass. To this end,  Richardson said the department's budget for next year contains $3 million for  wind projects and $5.6 million for geothermal projects in California;   Reduce electricity consumption at key times * Participate, along with  representatives from other federal agencies with facilities in California, in  meetings in Sacramento today to develop a process for reducing electricity  consumption during heat waves; and   Get federal power to California * Continue the work of the department's  Bonneville Power Administration and Western Area Power Administration with  California to get federal power to the state when it is needed the most.  Richardson announced that Bonneville's contract to provide low-cost power to  Bay Area Rapid Transit will continue;   Further cooperation with California * The Energy Department will also form a  partnership with the state of California to ensure that the department's  programs and resources are put to use to help the state with its electric  problems.   Separately today FERC released a report that examines the causes of  California's electricity problems. FERC also issued a proposed order that  will help reduce wholesale electricity prices in California. Richardson urged  the Commission to move quickly to help protect California's citizens and  businesses.

"I called Ed Chang from the Western Area Power Administration to ask about the  DOE involvement. It just so happened that he had attended the press  conference.  He and other state people were at a meeting to discuss how the  federal agnecies could work with state agencies.  They had only been meeting  for 15 minutes when they were told that they were going to be bussed over to  SMUD's Hedge Substation (don't you love the name?) for the press conference.   Richardson arrived with a flurry of black limos to announce his program.   Ed's view is that this was all for PR and that the ""changes"" don't help  California at all. The WAPA transformer referred to by Richardson is already  planned and in its approved budget (it is a joint upgrade project of the 500  kV lines by WAPA, PG&E and others at the Tracy and Tesla Substations).  Richardson did not even stay for the Governor's speach.  He left for the  airport.  The Governor arrived in a flurry of black limos.  He addressed the  FERC order a bit.  He felt FERC should have addressed the issue of refunds  for CA consumers. He was also concerned about FERC's order on governance.  He  said that deregulatrion was brought to us by Senator Peace and the Wilson  administration, but that the market is very different now than it was in  1996.  He said he believes in competition, but that the problems in the  market must be fixed.","jeff.dasovich@enron.com, mark.palmer@enron.com, mona.petrochko@enron.com,   sandra.mccubbin@enron.com, paul.kaufman@enron.com,   steven.kean@enron.com, richard.shapiro@enron.com,   james.steffes@enron.com, mary.hain@enron.com, joe.hartsoe@enron.com,   sarah.novosel@enron.com, david.parquet@enron.com,   tim.belden@enron.com, robert.badeer@enron.com",susan.mara@enron.com,Report of Eye Witness to Richardson/Davis Press Conference,2000-11-01 06:56:00-08:00,sent

"Gang,  I didn't get Jim's e-mail but .....  Here are my comments  This looks good as a bottomline message, but I'd like to dress it up and take  it out on a date first (doesn't dasovich talk like this?)  I'm afraid we'll look greedy unless we focus strongly on the RETAIL affect of  the low price cap and how raising it would ultimately allow retail customers  to save money and wholesale markets to work more efficiently.  there is some  stuff we can quote in the iso's market surveillance com report.  we also have  some real world experience to draw upon (i'm told that FERC occasionally  really likes to hear about the real world) -- we had a number of customers on  demand responsiveness plans in the east and we sent them checks for BIG BUCKS  this summer.  To the contrary, in the west, we were working with some  customers (a  few hundred MWs)  to participate in the ISO's program -- after  the Board voted to lower the cap to $250 -- the customers all said sayonara  -- could no longer justify the expense and the interference in their  operations.  These are powerful examples of how price caps influence retail  demand response.  This only goes so far, however...  The FERC could easily eliminate the problem by exempting demand side bids  from the price caps.  SO, we need more...  I think we should focus on the practical effects of a ""soft"" cap (not simple  and not certain) -- and how stable markets need stable price caps -- ""soft""  caps are not a stable price and do not send a stable signal for investment in  new generation (the market may never know the real price since it doesn't set  the MCP). The staff report provides some good evidence on why the caps are  too low and we could also use the ISO's calculation of prices for short-term  peaking capacity.  Then mention the issues Mary discussed below (information;  cap mechanism bad for power marketers in particular)  Sue     Mary Hain@ECT  11/02/2000 01:03 PM        To: Susan J Mara/NA/Enron@Enron, Mona L Petrochko/NA/Enron@Enron, Jeff  Dasovich/NA/Enron@Enron, Alan Comnes/PDX/ECT@ECT, Tim Belden/HOU/ECT@ECT,  Dave Parquet, Christopher F Calger/PDX/ECT@ECT    cc: James D Steffes/NA/Enron@Enron, Joe Hartsoe@Enron, Sarah  Novosel/Corp/Enron@ENRON, carrrn@bracepatt.com, Donna Fulton/Corp/Enron@ENRON    Subject: November 9 FERC Comments  In response to Jim's E-mail  - here's is my proposed list of issues for  Enron's November 9 comments.  We have to send our issue list to FERC tomorrow  so please comment on this ASAP.  We should discuss price signals including: price caps and market information  Here's my rationale.  Since we'll only have five to ten minutes to talk, our  comments should focus on the most important commercial issues to us: removing  or improving price caps and improving market transparency by providing market  information to market participants.  We could summarize the positions we took  in the white paper about why the Commission shouldn't allow a price cap at  all and why we need information.  In addition, we should assume that they  will adopt price caps anyway and may reaffirm their own proposal, so we  should also tell them how the $150 cap will be too low to incent investment  in new generation, how the reporting requirement will create special problems  for power marketers  (we don't have marginal costs and the Commission has yet  to determine what opportunity costs are), and how they still have not  addressed the problems created by OOM.  In addition, although I don't think we need to tell FERC this, our comments  could briefly congratulate the Commission for removing the buy/sell  requirement, addressing underscheduling of load, creating independent  governance and directing the ISO to file generation interconnection  procedures.  Although our written comments will probably want to discuss any  clarifications of this measures as well as the long term measures the  Commission discussed (reserve requirements, alternate auction mechanisms,  balanced schedules, enhanced market mitigation, congestion management  redesign, demand response programs, RTO development and compliance) our oral  comment time is too precious to use on these issues.  In addition, our  written comments will want to beef up the legal support for the Staff's  conclusion about refunds and perhaps request rehearing of the Commission's  decision to move the refund effective date.  I'm sure we'll find more issues  as we go. ",mary.hain@enron.com,susan.mara@enron.com,Re: November 9 FERC Comments,2000-11-02 05:50:00-08:00,sent

That is more of a challenge than you might imagine in this complicated deregulated world we find ourselves in. I believe we are making a good start.  ""Last year I was able to sign legislation that basically stabilized rates in San Diego, and I supported hundreds of millions of dollars for renewable power resources, like the photovotaic program you see behind us, to support financially and also encourage voluntary support for conservation programs up and down the state to reduce California's use of electricity by 10% when we had a Stage Two alert and to encourage demand management programs by a number of industries, including the technology and grocery industry that reduce the demand on any given day.  ""Having said all that, this market is dysfunctional. It is a very difficult environment for deregulation to work. And I repeat again, deregulation can work but only if all parties act responsibly and if the market is competitive, which it is not.  ""I was pleased to see that Secretary Richardson agrees with me that this market is dysfunctional and I am also somewhat pleased by the initial reports of the action that FERC took today. It is a mixed blessing. They do recognize that we are operating in a dysfunctional market and they do agree that the rates are not just or reasonable. However, they did not, as I encouraged, order rebates to the consumers and businesses in San Diego who were literally gouged and for the profiteering and market manipulation that San Diego had to suffer through.  ""FERC also decided to abolish the stakeholder boards at the ISO-independent service operator, and the power exchange. FERC agrees with me that they are self-serving and either contributed to or participated directly in market manipulation. However, it is unclear what will replace those boards. The good news is that they agree with our premise that the market is dysfunctional, rates are unreasonable and unjust. The bad news is there is no immediate remedy for ratepayers here in California.  ""I believe the marketplace generally makes good decisions but I am not going to be a prisoner of ideology. I do not want some knee jerk reactions to drive our economy or our consumers to their knees. I have seen time and again the most right wing conservatives in San Diego that say, 'please give us money to bail us out from the increased prices that have descended upon us.' So as I have long understood, economics drives politics and at the moment we are shipping about $6 billion more out of this state for electricity than we paid about 12 months ago. That has got to stop.  Question inaudible.  ""It appears that the FERC said they are going to restructure it and this again suggestes the complexity that we have to deal with. Once the state deregulated distribution from power generation in 1996, the PUC basically surrendered most of its control over the purchase and acquisition of electricity for California and that control reverted to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. As I read the initial reports from the FERC decision today, they are saying the ISO and the power exchange are dominated by stake holder members and they think that is ill advised, as do I. There will be new boards established and we will tell you how they are established. So it is unclear whether we have the authority to, independent of the FERC to establish our own ISO and power exchange. My initial reading of the press reports suggest that we may not. That is something that has to be cleared up over the next several days.  Question inaudible.  ""We have had a series of meetings over the past two months with all kinds of stakeholders from turn to utilities to generators, other consumer groups from San Diego and we are trying to forge a consensus which will indicate the path that we will take. I am not at the point where I can tell you what that consensus is. But we are making progress.  Question inaudible.  ""That we are going to fight for consumers, that they should not bear the full brunt of this experiment in deregulation. At best it was premature and the market place was not prepared. The marketplace is dysfunctional, it is not competitive. There is a far greater demand for electricity than we can generate in this state. I want them to know that we are working night and day to find a solution that will ensure that they are not the guinea pigs for this ill-conceived scheme.  ""I am pleased that FERC has recognized that the marketplace is dysfunctional, recognized that rates are unjust and unreasonable. I am not pleased that they have not offered any solutions. It looks like we are going to have to wait until November 9th at the hearing in front of FERC at which their full plan will be unveiled and there will be a chance to comment, critique and modify and then thirty days after that the plan will be adopted in full or in part. This is a very important meeting in which our administration will be fully represented and I hope to be able to inform the consumers of this state more fully at the conclusion of that meeting if not before.  ""I believe refunds are due and necessary. FERC and the Secretary of Energy have concurred with my assessment that these rates are not just and reasonable and I believe that FERC has the power to order refunds. It is unclear whether they believe they have the power to do it or not. Congress could settle  the question by simply passing legislation to ensure that. Over the long haul, by that I mean 5 to 10 to 15 years, I believe deregulation can work but only if we have a competitive marketplace and if all parties act responsibly. As I told everyone involved in this process, some people may win the battle but lose the war if they insist on gouging every consumer and citizen of this state. The people of California will stand up; they will rise up and take matters into their own hands. The problem with deregulation lowering rates, is that we have not seen them and frankly none are on the immediate horizon.  Question inaudible.  ""Let me just say two things. I think there is plenty of blame to go around but there is no question that the generators who happen to be out-of-state companies are charging us 600 to 700% more for the very same electricity that we purchased last year. You cannot add value to an electron. An electron is an electron. They are simply taking advantage of an ill-advised scheme envisioned in the 1996 act to charge what the market will bear. I am standing up and saying no more. We are not going to take this lying down. We are fighting back. The difficulty is that we do not have the power that we used to have. The state surrendered a lot of that power when Governor Wilson signed the deregulation bill. Actually carried by Jim Brulte and co authored by Steve Peace, they were the two driving forces as they will be happy, well maybe not so happy, to acknowledge. It may have seemed like a good idea in 1996 but I did not participate in that debate and I don't have a comment on whether it was a good idea then. But clearly in the year 2000 it is not a good idea. Again our problem is we can describe the problem and we have some limited authority over the power the utilities have not yet sold off to the generators which is about 35-40% of their facilities that they used to own and we do not have control over the facilities they have sold off to the out of state generators that purchased them. FERC has control over them and it is unclear whether we even have control to establish our own ISO and our own power exchange and if we did I would have them reconstituted. There is no question about that. They are too self serving too inbred and too incestuous and do not represent consumer interests. Plus you cannot hold anyone accountable there is no one public official on any one of those boards. You cannot hold anyone accountable and they determine largely what the price of electricity is and how any shortages are allocated throughout the state. So these are serious responsibilities given to these stakeholder boards and no public official participates on those boards.  Question inaudible.  ""You are more right than wrong. As the chief executive of this state I am going to advocate what I believe is in the best interests of our consumers and businesses. Electricity is the lifeblood of our economy. Without water and electricity, consumers and businesses are just simply out of luck. Whether or not this deregulatory scheme in 1996 made sense then is a question not worth debating today. But it does not make sense today. Unfortunately that plan adopted by our legislature and governor Wilson in 1996 surrendered control over generating facilities that the PUC used to monitor and supervise. So it is unclear how much power is left to the state. FERC seems to be suggesting  today, not much. Obviously as governor of this state I want to assert as much authority as I possibly can because I know I will be held accountable and obviously I would like the authority to go along with the responsibility that is laid at my doorstep.  ""I have one goal in mind: to do our level best to make sure that our lights stay on and our economy has the benefit of the electricity it needs and the prices are reasonable. What path we take to that matters less to me than that we get to that result. Because that is the result that is necessary to allow consumers to go about their lives and business to function and make a profit and hire more people and to sustain our economic growth which in turn provides the resources that allow us to finance the schools and protect the environment and provide healthcare.

That is more of a challenge than you might imagine in this complicated deregulated world we find ourselves in. I believe we are making a good start.  ""Last year I was able to sign legislation that basically stabilized rates in San Diego, and I supported hundreds of millions of dollars for renewable power resources, like the photovotaic program you see behind us, to support financially and also encourage voluntary support for conservation programs up and down the state to reduce California's use of electricity by 10% when we had a Stage Two alert and to encourage demand management programs by a number of industries, including the technology and grocery industry that reduce the demand on any given day.  ""Having said all that, this market is dysfunctional. It is a very difficult environment for deregulation to work. And I repeat again, deregulation can work but only if all parties act responsibly and if the market is competitive, which it is not.  ""I was pleased to see that Secretary Richardson agrees with me that this market is dysfunctional and I am also somewhat pleased by the initial reports of the action that FERC took today. It is a mixed blessing. They do recognize that we are operating in a dysfunctional market and they do agree that the rates are not just or reasonable. However, they did not, as I encouraged, order rebates to the consumers and businesses in San Diego who were literally gouged and for the profiteering and market manipulation that San Diego had to suffer through.  ""FERC also decided to abolish the stakeholder boards at the ISO-independent service operator, and the power exchange. FERC agrees with me that they are self-serving and either contributed to or participated directly in market manipulation. However, it is unclear what will replace those boards. The good news is that they agree with our premise that the market is dysfunctional, rates are unreasonable and unjust. The bad news is there is no immediate remedy for ratepayers here in California.  ""I believe the marketplace generally makes good decisions but I am not going to be a prisoner of ideology. I do not want some knee jerk reactions to drive our economy or our consumers to their knees. I have seen time and again the most right wing conservatives in San Diego that say, 'please give us money to bail us out from the increased prices that have descended upon us.' So as I have long understood, economics drives politics and at the moment we are shipping about $6 billion more out of this state for electricity than we paid about 12 months ago. That has got to stop.  Question inaudible.  ""It appears that the FERC said they are going to restructure it and this again suggestes the complexity that we have to deal with. Once the state deregulated distribution from power generation in 1996, the PUC basically surrendered most of its control over the purchase and acquisition of electricity for California and that control reverted to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. As I read the initial reports from the FERC decision today, they are saying the ISO and the power exchange are dominated by stake holder members and they think that is ill advised, as do I. There will be new boards established and we will tell you how they are established. So it is unclear whether we have the authority to, independent of the FERC to establish our own ISO and power exchange. My initial reading of the press reports suggest that we may not. That is something that has to be cleared up over the next several days.  Question inaudible.  ""We have had a series of meetings over the past two months with all kinds of stakeholders from turn to utilities to generators, other consumer groups from San Diego and we are trying to forge a consensus which will indicate the path that we will take. I am not at the point where I can tell you what that consensus is. But we are making progress.  Question inaudible.  ""That we are going to fight for consumers, that they should not bear the full brunt of this experiment in deregulation. At best it was premature and the market place was not prepared. The marketplace is dysfunctional, it is not competitive. There is a far greater demand for electricity than we can generate in this state. I want them to know that we are working night and day to find a solution that will ensure that they are not the guinea pigs for this ill-conceived scheme.  ""I am pleased that FERC has recognized that the marketplace is dysfunctional, recognized that rates are unjust and unreasonable. I am not pleased that they have not offered any solutions. It looks like we are going to have to wait until November 9th at the hearing in front of FERC at which their full plan will be unveiled and there will be a chance to comment, critique and modify and then thirty days after that the plan will be adopted in full or in part. This is a very important meeting in which our administration will be fully represented and I hope to be able to inform the consumers of this state more fully at the conclusion of that meeting if not before.  ""I believe refunds are due and necessary. FERC and the Secretary of Energy have concurred with my assessment that these rates are not just and reasonable and I believe that FERC has the power to order refunds. It is unclear whether they believe they have the power to do it or not. Congress could settle  the question by simply passing legislation to ensure that. Over the long haul, by that I mean 5 to 10 to 15 years, I believe deregulation can work but only if we have a competitive marketplace and if all parties act responsibly. As I told everyone involved in this process, some people may win the battle but lose the war if they insist on gouging every consumer and citizen of this state. The people of California will stand up; they will rise up and take matters into their own hands. The problem with deregulation lowering rates, is that we have not seen them and frankly none are on the immediate horizon.  Question inaudible.  ""Let me just say two things. I think there is plenty of blame to go around but there is no question that the generators who happen to be out-of-state companies are charging us 600 to 700% more for the very same electricity that we purchased last year. You cannot add value to an electron. An electron is an electron. They are simply taking advantage of an ill-advised scheme envisioned in the 1996 act to charge what the market will bear. I am standing up and saying no more. We are not going to take this lying down. We are fighting back. The difficulty is that we do not have the power that we used to have. The state surrendered a lot of that power when Governor Wilson signed the deregulation bill. Actually carried by Jim Brulte and co authored by Steve Peace, they were the two driving forces as they will be happy, well maybe not so happy, to acknowledge. It may have seemed like a good idea in 1996 but I did not participate in that debate and I don't have a comment on whether it was a good idea then. But clearly in the year 2000 it is not a good idea. Again our problem is we can describe the problem and we have some limited authority over the power the utilities have not yet sold off to the generators which is about 35-40% of their facilities that they used to own and we do not have control over the facilities they have sold off to the out of state generators that purchased them. FERC has control over them and it is unclear whether we even have control to establish our own ISO and our own power exchange and if we did I would have them reconstituted. There is no question about that. They are too self serving too inbred and too incestuous and do not represent consumer interests. Plus you cannot hold anyone accountable there is no one public official on any one of those boards. You cannot hold anyone accountable and they determine largely what the price of electricity is and how any shortages are allocated throughout the state. So these are serious responsibilities given to these stakeholder boards and no public official participates on those boards.  Question inaudible.  ""You are more right than wrong. As the chief executive of this state I am going to advocate what I believe is in the best interests of our consumers and businesses. Electricity is the lifeblood of our economy. Without water and electricity, consumers and businesses are just simply out of luck. Whether or not this deregulatory scheme in 1996 made sense then is a question not worth debating today. But it does not make sense today. Unfortunately that plan adopted by our legislature and governor Wilson in 1996 surrendered control over generating facilities that the PUC used to monitor and supervise. So it is unclear how much power is left to the state. FERC seems to be suggesting  today, not much. Obviously as governor of this state I want to assert as much authority as I possibly can because I know I will be held accountable and obviously I would like the authority to go along with the responsibility that is laid at my doorstep.  ""I have one goal in mind: to do our level best to make sure that our lights stay on and our economy has the benefit of the electricity it needs and the prices are reasonable. What path we take to that matters less to me than that we get to that result. Because that is the result that is necessary to allow consumers to go about their lives and business to function and make a profit and hire more people and to sustain our economic growth which in turn provides the resources that allow us to finance the schools and protect the environment and provide healthcare. Without electricity there is no economic growth, without economic growth we do not have the resources to do justice to our public obligations.

I'm afraid we'll look greedy unless we focus strongly on the RETAIL affect of  the low price cap and how raising it would ultimately allow retail customers  to save money and wholesale markets to work more efficiently.  there is some  stuff we can quote in the iso's market surveillance com report.  we also have  some real world experience to draw upon (i'm told that FERC occasionally  really likes to hear about the real world) -- we had a number of customers on  demand responsiveness plans in the east and we sent them checks for BIG BUCKS  this summer.

These are powerful examples of how price caps influence retail  demand response.  This only goes so far, however...  The FERC could easily eliminate the problem by exempting demand side bids  from the price caps.  SO, we need more...  I think we should focus on the practical effects of a ""soft"" cap (not simple  and not certain) -- and how stable markets need stable price caps -- ""soft""  caps are not a stable price and do not send a stable signal for investment in  new generation (the market may never know the real price since it doesn't set  the MCP).

We have to send our issue list to FERC tomorrow  so please comment on this ASAP.  We should discuss price signals including: price caps and market information  Here's my rationale.  Since we'll only have five to ten minutes to talk, our  comments should focus on the most important commercial issues to us: removing  or improving price caps and improving market transparency by providing market  information to market participants.  We could summarize the positions we took  in the white paper about why the Commission shouldn't allow a price cap at  all and why we need information.  In addition, we should assume that they  will adopt price caps anyway and may reaffirm their own proposal, so we  should also tell them how the $150 cap will be too low to incent investment  in new generation, how the reporting requirement will create special problems  for power marketers  (we don't have marginal costs and the Commission has yet  to determine what opportunity costs are), and how they still have not  addressed the problems created by OOM.  In addition, although I don't think we need to tell FERC this, our comments  could briefly congratulate the Commission for removing the buy/sell  requirement, addressing underscheduling of load, creating independent  governance and directing the ISO to file generation interconnection  procedures.  Although our written comments will probably want to discuss any  clarifications of this measures as well as the long term measures the  Commission discussed (reserve requirements, alternate auction mechanisms,  balanced schedules, enhanced market mitigation, congestion management  redesign, demand response programs, RTO development and compliance) our oral  comment time is too precious to use on these issues.  In addition, our  written comments will want to beef up the legal support for the Staff's  conclusion about refunds and perhaps request rehearing of the Commission's  decision to move the refund effective date.  I'm sure we'll find more issues  as we go.    ",susan.mara@enron.com,mary.hain@enron.com,Re: November 9 FERC Comments,2000-11-02 08:21:00-08:00,received
"GREETINGS:  So, we're all happy that FERC finally made a decision.  Traders tell me the  market has stabilized and people think much of the regulatory uncertainty has  ended.  NOT SO FAST..... I am NOT an attorney -- but here are my current  guesses.  ISSUE:  FERC has created a huge constitutional issue with the state of CA.   The FERC has ordered the ISO to do something differently than what was  specified in the state legislation, AB 1890.  The last time this happened, in  late 1999 (on ISO and PX governance), the state reared its back -- and FERC  caved in.  So let's not be sanguine about what FERC has done here.  Much will  need to be done by Enron and others to bolster FERC.  THE COURTS:  The state could get its back up and decide to fight this.  The  potential is that FERC will get political pressure to ""settle"", once a  request for rehearing is submitted.  Remember --- this is ALL political.   It's not about logic.  Last time, the state, through the Oversight Board,  submitted a request for rehearing with FERC.  FERC told them to pound sand,  so the EOB then filed in federal court to overturn the order.  This was  ""settled"" when the state negotiated with FERC behind the scenes and FERC did  a 180. (We have a court case pending on that order.)  If the state decides to  go the rehearing route, I'm not too sure when they could initiate court  action.  They could probably file for an emergency stay, but they tried that  in the last court case and it was rejected.     GOVERNOR:   A little has been trickling out.  Gov. Davis went to town at a  press conference yesterday, talking about gouging generators and sending $6  billion out of state.  He stated his unhappiness with the FERC not providing  refunds.  He says his adminstration will continue its fight to have refunds  ordered. His administration will ""participate fully"" in the FERC hearing on  Nov 9.  The Governor believes that the state lost control of its transmission  system when it passed 1890.  So, I could conceive of some legislation or a  federal push to ""give it back.""  I don't think that would be ultimately  successful, but it would likely create some wild times.  FEDERAL:  The press reported that U.S. Sen Feinstein will introduce a measure  in the next few days to give FERC retroactive refund authority.  STATE LEGISLATURE:     State Sen Bowen has said she plans to hold a hearing  in mid-month and will draft a ""legislative response to the FERC proposal.""    Assemblyman Rod Wright met with about 30 people today (suppliers and  utilities) to explore some issues.  He wants to take leadership of the issue  and is supported by the Speaker of the House.  He plans legislative action.  CONSUMER ADVOCATES:  Press reports state that several consumer organizations  are considering court action to get the refunds.  TIMING:  Soon and  sooner.  Hearings can happen any time.  The legislature  returns in January and we can expect emergency legislation and a quick pace.

In addition, we should assume that they  will adopt price caps anyway and may reaffirm their own proposal, so we  should also tell them how the $150 cap will be too low to incent investment  in new generation, how the reporting requirement will create special problems  for power marketers  (we don't have marginal costs and the Commission has yet  to determine what opportunity costs are), and how they still have not  addressed the problems created by OOM.  In addition, although I don't think we need to tell FERC this, our comments  could briefly congratulate the Commission for removing the buy/sell  requirement, addressing underscheduling of load, creating independent  governance and directing the ISO to file generation interconnection  procedures.  Although our written comments will probably want to discuss any  clarifications of this measures as well as the long term measures the  Commission discussed (reserve requirements, alternate auction mechanisms,  balanced schedules, enhanced market mitigation, congestion management  redesign, demand response programs, RTO development and compliance) our oral  comment time is too precious to use on these issues.  In addition, our  written comments will want to beef up the legal support for the Staff's  conclusion about refunds and perhaps request rehearing of the Commission's  decision to move the refund effective date.  I'm sure we'll find more issues  as we go.   ",susan.mara@enron.com,jeff.dasovich@enron.com,Re: November 9 FERC Comments,2000-11-06 03:01:00-08:00,received

My time trial shows it takes 6 min and 45 seconds to deliver.  We need to cut.  Dan, can you send me a front end to this that I will utilize to make copies?  Send me the front end from last week's filing supporting EPSA's motion.  I'll take comments up to 12 noon Wednesday. gba =============================   The Western Power Trading Forum (WPTF) is a California non-profit trade association of almost thirty members who sell, buy and exchange power throughout the Western U.S.  We are pleased to provide comments on the following areas in response to your Order issued last week.  1. Price caps and their unintended consequences  2. Forward scheduling, penalties, mandatory must-buy, and  3. Independent Governing Boards.  First, I would like to take this opportunity to express our overall gratitude to the Commission for issuing its Order.  The members of WPTF have been bitterly frustrated by the events of the last summer, and equally upset by the actions of non-jurisdictional parties in their attempt to grab the steering wheel of restructuring, and drive it into the ground. As I listened to your comments last week, I took note of all the things you said, and the stated purpose of your actions.  After listening to you, and reading the Order, I very much wanted to be here today, even if it only afforded me a brief 5-minutes of your time.  I would have flown here from California even if you only allowed me one phrase to be uttered publicly.  And that phrase would be ""Thank you. Thank you for taking the bold step forward to revive California's wholesale power market.  Thank you for having the courage to stand up to parochial interests which are entirely self serving, and absent of any national policy goals.""  This Commission took a stab at correcting California's problems utilizing several measures, one of which was a $150 price cap.  Whereas we applaud the Commission's effort,  we find that price caps send the wrong signal to both suppliers and load.  We have found that price caps misallocate resources, and as your Staff report demonstrates, increases exports of power to other parts of the grid where no caps exists.  We find that price caps discourage demand-side participation, and at the level proposed, will discourage much needed peaking generation resources.  We also find that any price cap, but especially at the level you have proposed, will create unintended consequences.  For example, when market bids exceed $150, sellers will avoid bidding into the ISO or the PX.  Will the market solution be as simple as bidding instead into a competitive exchange to the PX, such as APX, or AlTrade?  Will the liquidity of the bids suddenly flip from one market to another because of an arbitrary line below which the single price auction operates, and above which the bilateral market prevails?  That is a huge hammer, a huge movement of tens of millions of dollars moving within the space of an hour from one trading vehicle to another.  WPTF has been against price caps, and continues to believe that price caps do much damage, and do not protect consumers.  The damages include prolonging high prices, reducing price discovery, and reducing the quantity of long-term offers that otherwise would afford consumers much-needed price protection.  Average prices do not diminish with caps, in fact, as you know, August prices in California were much higher than last June, even though the buyer price cap imposed by the ISO Governing Board was $250 instead of $750.  We recognize that the political reality is such that regulators don't like price spikes, and caps are a quick solution.  If you feel that price caps must be imposed, then limit the damage.  We believe that Commissioner Hebert's price cap proposal which starts at $250, and increments upward by specific amounts at specific times would be the least damaging.  We also believe that a formulaic price cap that moves with respect to demand, or fuel price would be the most harmful.  Market participants can not conduct business with so much uncertainty hanging in the balance.  The Commission recognized on the matter of Governance that California needs regulatory stability, and the Commission is pursuing policy options to regain much needed stability.  On the other hand, floating price caps work in the opposite direction.  They reek havoc because they inject more uncertainty, and lessen stability.  If price caps are at all necessary, stick to the least damaging approach.  WPTF supports forward scheduling of demand, the imposition of real-time penalties, and we support elimination of the must-buy provision embedded in the California PUC Preferred Policy Decision.  Underscheduling of load has been a practice that has lead to economic dislocation, and reduced grid reliability.  Mandatory pre-scheduling will get the ISO back on track by prudently limiting the amount of load that can be exposed to real-time resolution.  Also, by eliminating the must-buy provision, the UDCs can no longer complain about ""supply not showing up"". Their avenues for finding cost-effective supply will be unlimited.  Finally, we support the replacement of the stakeholder boards with independent board members.  Whereas we have been troubled by the antics of the ISO Governing Board, we must note that the PX Governing Board has not had the same type of problems. The PX Governing Board has done much better at finding solutions to thorny problems.  But it is asking too much, we think, to spare one and eliminate the other.  The actions of the ISO Governing Board have proven to be highly damaging to the credibility of electric restructuring.  Other states eschew restructuring after observing the endless debates, the layers upon layers of State interference in the workings of the California ISO Governing Board, and the leverage exercised by voting blocks of Governors with interests totally removed from the well-being of the very institution on whose Board they serve.  We are concerned that the rules you have laid out for replacing the stakeholder Governing Board may not be enough.  There may be incredible pressure placed upon the existing Board members to select candidates that further the aims of those that claim to protect consumers, but in fact, are making a power grab.  My organization promises the Commission that if we suspect, if we have evidence, if we detect, or otherwise observe actions by a few to undermine the independence of a new Board, I can assure you I will be back here raising my voice loudly in protest. The California market simply can not survive serving two masters.  The jurisdictional tug of war must end quickly so that we all can move forward and pursue the goals and ambitions set out by this Commission in Orders 888, and 2000.   Thank you.

"Another key point:  to avoid the mistakes of California, policy makers must  make it easy to site and interconnect new generation.  In California peak  demand rose by about 5500 MW from 1996 - 2000.  The market responded with  porposed capacity additions of about 11000 MW.  Most of these facilities are  working thier way through the tangle of state and local approvals.  The  problems we saw in California did not need to occur if policy makers simply  enabled the market to work.  Also, it's worth noting that the deregulated  market did work.  Customers who signed with Enron saw a lower bill than  prederegulation, Enron hedged its commitments and so our customers (and  Enron) did just fine during the summer.  Deregulation worked; the problems in  California can be directly traced to continued regulatory interference in the  market.

California's electricity market is a mess. First a hot summer in the south brought shortages and skyrocketing prices. Now the state is threatened with another wave of rolling blackouts stemming from elevated heating demands caused by a cold snap and from power plants being out of service. Californians may even be asked to turn off their Christmas lights to conserve energy.      Deregulation of the industry in 1996 is being blamed for California's energy crunch, to a large extent justifiably. The rules under which the ""deregulated"" market has been operating, combined with woefully insufficient power generation capacity, have allowed some power providers to make a killing at the expense of consumers. Because electricity was plentiful in 1996, the state froze all new power plant construction in the belief there was enough capacity to meet future needs. Going back to privately owned or state-run monopolies, however, is not the answer. Rather, the rules have to be changed to give the utilities more freedom in buying and selling electricity and to encourage power generators to build new plants in the state. For their part, consumers should conserve more electrical power.      The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which controls the wholesale electricity market and drives deregulation nationwide, has drawn up rules aimed at bringing relief to consumers as soon as the changes are adopted. In the long run, however, it is up to the state to streamline and speed up procedures for approving new power plants. It takes years just to comply with rigid environmental laws and get all the paperwork done.      The reason California led the way in electricity deregulation is that the old monopoly utilities were inefficient and their rates were among the highest in the country. Re-creating that system, aside from the cost, would return the state to the sluggish monopolies. It would do nothing to solve the underlying problem of insufficient power supply. New capacity would still have to be built to accommodate the booming economy.      The cornerstone of the federal proposal is the elimination of state rules that have forced utilities such as San Diego Gas & Electric Co., the guinea pig in the deregulation experiment, and Southern California Edison to buy or sell most of their load on the highly volatile spot markets. That prevents them from entering into long-term contracts that would make supply more reliable and prices more stable. Power suppliers, aided by spikes in demand, used the state restrictions skillfully to drive up prices. Los Angeles was spared the high cost and power shortages because its city-run utility, the Department of Water and Power, is not subject to the illogical state market restrictions.      Other federal proposals would overhaul the state's power transmission and exchange agencies to make them independent of the power generators and utilities and require them to report noncompetitive market behavior. The federal government could then require sellers to refund their ill-gotten gains.      Gov. Gray Davis was right in telling the federal energy commission last week that the market rules have been manipulated in California to generate ""obscene profits"" for power suppliers. But he was wrong in suggesting that the state should regain control of the industry. The market behaved according to the flawed rules the California Legislature wrote for it. The federal proposal would go a long way toward fixing the problem. Sacramento, meanwhile, should encourage energy conservation programs and the development of alternative and renewable power sources.

"Bob Anderson of APSES developed these data.  They show that the utilities  took unbelievably outrageous open positions in the market this summer. There  are two possibilities: 1 they are incompetent (WRONG) or 2 they were OK from  a corporate perspective (because of other long positions) and expected to  receive regulatory relief.

However, in discussing this with Steven, it seems as  if IEP has not yet put some guidance around ""appropriate.""

IEP will be stressing the importance of the contracts as part of the solution for next summer. Several IEP members have offered (and have continued to offer) long-term fixed contracts at terms under the current retail rate freeze.  We will indicate that the utilities have been hesitant to enter into these contracts due to the uncertain nature of the CPUC.  We will point out that several different independent entities have agreed that long-term contracts are one of the key solutions and that the PUC should act immediately to set a benchmark and in so doing eliminate the reasonableness review that is the main barrier for IOU's not entering into large long-term fixed contracts.  IEP is also currently working to include other market participants in the Press Conference.  We would like as many IEP participants as possible at the conference to show that there are several companies who continue to be serious about long-term fixed price contracts. We have already received a couple of responses and if you are interested please let me know ASAP-no later than noon Wednesday- as we are sending out an advisory on Monday.

Present were Don Sevrens, news  editor/insight section; Bill Osborne, senior editor/opinion; Jim Gogek,  editorial writer; Bernie Jones, editor, opinion pages; Craig Rose, the  reporter who has written extensively on the topic, and a photographer.  My two primary messages were that (1) wholesale and retail competition is  working elsewhere, particularly in Pennsylvania, and can eventually work in  California if the rules are changed, and (2) California has a severe supply  shortage and needs to focus on providing incentives for new generation and  expediting the permitting process.  I was subtly trying to get across the  message that leadership was needed to help Californians deal with the need to  reconcile their environmental and land use goals with the need to bring their  power supply and demand into balance.  I, of course, defended FERC's order on  the causes of the price volatility in California this summer and their lack  of any authority to order retroactive refunds.  I also pointed out that there  were no findings of individual market abuse, so that refunds wouldn't be  warranted even if there was legal authority.  I also pointed out the problems  with price caps.  Other than Craig Rose, who disagreed with me any chance he got, the others  asked good questions and seemed to be listening.  They made the point  repeatedly that this matter is very political, suggesting that a political  compromise with the generators/marketers is necessary.  One of them said he  had heard there was a deal with the generators being negotiated and asked me  my position.  I responded that I had no response.  Anything like that is the  business of individual members.  They indicated that they expected to do a story for this coming Sunday's  Insight Section.  Please give me any feedback you have.  cc:  Stu Ryan, AES by fax        Jim Macias, Calpine, by fax          ",richard.shapiro@enron.com,susan.mara@enron.com,Re: Report of Editorial Board Meeting with the San Diego  Union-Tribune,2000-11-22 00:18:00-08:00,sent

IEP will be stressing the importance of the contracts as part of the solution for next summer. Several IEP members have offered (and have continued to offer) long-term fixed contracts at terms under the current retail rate freeze.  We will indicate that the utilities have been hesitant to enter into these contracts due to the uncertain nature of the CPUC.  We will point out that several different independent entities have agreed that long-term contracts are one of the key solutions and that the PUC should act immediately to set a benchmark and in so doing eliminate the reasonableness review that is the main barrier for IOU's not entering into large long-term fixed contracts.  IEP is also currently working to include other market participants in the Press Conference.  We would like as many IEP participants as possible at the conference to show that there are several companies who continue to be serious about long-term fixed price contracts. We have already received a couple of responses and if you are interested please let me know ASAP-no later than noon Wednesday- as we are sending out an advisory on Monday.

The comments do not explicitly address the level of the cap.  They= =20 also call for a technical conference.  Anything to add, Sue? ***************************************************************************= *** *************************************** B. Issues Concerning Implementation of the =01&Soft Cap.=018 =20  IEP has concerns about the implementation of the =01&soft cap=018 proposal.=   IEP=20 has not and does not support price caps because it impedes the operation of= =20 the market and distorts price signals.  Such mechanisms should have no plac= e=20 in competitive markets in the long-run.  The Staff Report notes that caps d= o=20 not work. Citation; Also MSC,   IEP is concerned, as are others, that the= =20 soft cap proposal will fail to attract new investments in supply or foster= =20 meaningful demand response.   It is particularly problematic in terms of=20 attracting new capacity that will operate as peaker units for a limited=20 number of hours when weather-induced demand cannot be met from less expensi= ve=20 units or imports. Notwithstanding the apparent opinion of SMUD otherwise,= =20 there are demands which materialize only for a fraction of a percentage of= =20 the total hours of a year, and therefore some resources will only be=20 dispatched a short number of hours to meet that need.  These resources tend= =20 to be fast ramping, less efficient units that are not designed or intended = to=20 operate as =01&baseload=018 facilities.  Hence the suggestion that they =01= &just=20 operate more=018 to recover their costs is misplaced. =20 The soft cap also appears to be especially problematic to power marketers w= ho=20 make wholesale purchases for subsequent resale but who may not own the=20 underlying physical generation assets.  These entities have a major role in= =20 the marketplace in terms of bringing demand and supply together and they se= ek=20 return on the risks they undertake.  These entities will perceive the =01&s= oft=20 cap=018 as a =01&hard cap=018 which will chill their participation in Calif= ornia,=20 particularly when regional supplies become tight and expensive.  This=20 unintended consequence must be avoided or the markets will be hobbled. =20 IEP echoes the concern articulated by the CAISO that the soft cap proposal= =20 may divert or require additional ISO resources.    It will clearly compound= =20 the settlement processes at the CAISO as transactions above the soft cap wi= ll=20 require additional tracking and segregation to allow for potential=20 =01&unwinding=018 should the bids be disallowed.  It will also require some=  form of=20 new software to provide for potential calculation of the weighted averaged= =20 prices suggested in the November Order, presumably in 10-minute increments,= =20 to blend with the market clearing prices established in the various markets= . =20 Moreover, if that averaged price associated with bids above the cap is=20 modified often, then CAISO will be required to =01&re-run=018 settlements o= r=20 undertake subsequent settlement adjustments.  It is possible that these=20 efforts=01*which are suggested as temporary measures in the November Order= =01*would=20 take away from CAISO=01,s efforts at developing solutions to longer-run pro= blems=20 in terms of software modifications/development.  At first blush the details= =20 regarding implementation of the soft cap proposal are not straightforward a= s=20 currently described, and any further exploration this approach will at leas= t=20 require a =01&technical conference=018 to clarify the mechanics and to ensu= re that=20 it can be done in a reasonable manner. =20 IEP could only support the soft cap proposal if it is part of a negotiated= =20 package of inter-jurisdictional programs, and provided that it is subject t= o=20 an pre-established unidirectional escalation mechanism, or a similar one-wa= y=20 mechanism that is tied to the development of new capacity within the WSCC. = =20 The inter-jurisdictional elements must include: ? establishment of standards applicable to potential refunds based on=20 allegations of market power abuse in FERC jurisdictional markets;=20 ? definition of durable reasonableness review standards applicable to=20 wholesale purchases by the load serving utilities such that they will no=20 longer be discouraged from entering bilateral arrangements on a forward bas= is; ? establishment of a =01&road map=018 by the California Commission that del= ineates=20 a firm timeline=01*with milestones=01*for the review and resolution of reta= il=20 market issues including market-based demand responsiveness; ? establishment of a =01&road map=018 by this Commission, in consultation w= ith the=20 CAISO, that delineates a firm timeline=01*with milestones=01*for the review=  and=20 resolution of implementation issues associated with the Commission=01,s=20 subsequent order in this docket as well as other outstanding proposals such= =20 as generation interconnection rules and congestion management; ? establishment of firm sunset date, not to exceed 2003, to bound the=20 duration of soft cap, and implement a unidirectional escalation mechanism,= =20 not subject to subsequent lowering, which is based either on a=20 pre-established schedule or tied to increases in installed capacity within= =20 the WSCC.    =09Susan J Mara =0911/22/2000 10:21 AM =09=09 =09=09 To: James D Steffes/NA/Enron@Enron =09=09 cc: Alan Comnes/PDX/ECT@ECT, bernadette Hawkins/Corp/Enron@Enron,=20 Christopher F Calger/PDX/ECT@ECT, David Parquet/SF/ECT@ECT, Debra=20 Davidson/PDX/ECT@ECT, Dennis Benevides/HOU/EES@EES, gfergus@brobeck.com,=20 Ginger Dernehl/NA/Enron@Enron, Jeff Dasovich/NA/Enron@Enron, Jeff=20 Richter/HOU/ECT@ECT, Joe Hartsoe/Corp/Enron@Enron, Joseph=20 Alamo/NA/Enron@Enron, Jubran Whalan/HOU/EES@EES, kcurry@bracepatt.com,=20 lanai.wolfe@enron.com, Marcia A Linton/NA/Enron@Enron, Mary Hain/HOU/ECT@EC= T,=20 Maureen McVicker/NA/Enron@Enron, Mona L Petrochko/NA/Enron@Enron, Neil=20 Bresnan/HOU/EES@EES, Paul Kaufman/PDX/ECT@ECT, rcarroll@bracepatt.com,=20 Richard Shapiro/NA/Enron@Enron, Robert Badeer/HOU/ECT@ECT, Sarah=20 Novosel/Corp/Enron@Enron, Steven J Kean/NA/Enron@Enron, Tim Belden/HOU/ECT@= ECT =09=09 Subject: Re: Enron's Response Today - Key Point to Focus On  I know that WPTF is supporting Hebert's approach and would suggest starting= =20 with $250 or higher with big increments every six months.

I would recommend that the pleading and Alan's testimony be modified to bri= ng=20 these issues to the top of the ticket.   We should still include all of our= =20 other arguments.

I think we agreed to do that after our bills were sent out to you in early November, so that is why you would have a bill with that amount still in your pile.  We will write it off immediately.  As I looked over the outstanding bills, the ones we really want to clear up this asap include the following:  2704-110   $2,539.36   over 180 days old.  This is the distribution OII we discussed that                should be approved on a routine basis  2704-118  $6,596.45 in total covering this months bill plus two small ones 90 days and 150                days old.  This is the Post Transition Ratemaking case, again, it should be routine as we had an RCR in place.  2704-127   $2,031.79 over 150 days old.  This is Enron's share of the ARM  RCS Direct Access               case.  Again, there should not be a problem with the billings as more recent bills have been paid.  2704-132   $21,012.22  This is the big kahuna, in the PG&E hydro case. More recent                   amounts have all been paid, but this 150 day old bill has not, and we suspect it got caught in the accounting software changeover.  This is one we would really love the find soon.  2704-140   PAID      We just got the check on Jeff's gas strategy case.  2704-144   $2,929.08   This is Enron's share of the Electric investigation work for ARM,                comprised of two bills, the most recent one from early Nov. and a $2,126.81 bill which is 90 days old.  So, those are the ones we would like to track, and if you have any problems with any of these please let me know as soon as you can.  I will take care of the write off on 2704-003.

"Are you proposing to have a conference call on this?  Alan, remember we  talked to Tim about meeting with the traders about this - what is the status  of that?     Here are my comments.  In general, I don't think we should refer to WPTF  arguments where we have made our own arguments, in particular on number 5.   We should summarize EES/EPMI's arguments as I did in my proposed draft answer  to this question.  With respect to answers to questions 2 and 4,  I think we  should make more legally-oriented arguments essentially restating the  arguments we made in EES/EPMI's comments to FERC, along the lines of my  proposed draft answers.  Although the Commissioners will not read our  pleadings, they are likely to read our answers to these questions so this  will give us an opportunity to summarize our pleadings.  In addition, these  are positions that we have already agreed to and discussed.  For those of you  who don't have my suggested draft answers, they are attached.

Tomorrow Martin Wenzel is speaking at a 1200 BOMA Luncheon at the  Sheraton Palace Hotel at the Corner of Market and New Montgomery in San  Francisco.  Martin was hoping that one of you might be available to attend.   He thought that if you were not busy it might be valuable to have a  government affairs expert available in case any tough regulatory questions  came up.  If you are both busy I am sure we will get by.  We are currently  trying to structure a new offering for their membership in the greater East  Bay Area.    2.  Below is an excerpt from an e-mail I received from a customer.  My first  inclination is that the customer is talking about the $65.00 rate cap in  place in SDG&E and does not understand the implementation.  But this customer  happens to be very savvy and is normally very involved in the regulatory  environment.  Is there a new issue regarding some type of $65.00 rate cap  that is being discussed for 2001 that is different from the current SDG&E  proposal?  If so, what are the details.  As you can see below, depending on  how it is implemented, it could be a problem.  My interpretation of the  comments below is that this customer thinks a $65.00 rate cap is going to be  put in place in 2001 and any charges above this cap are going to be shared by  all rate payers equally. Therefore, it does them no good to lock in a higher  price with an ESP if the market price is above $65.00.  I have a phone call  in to the customer to get more details.   ""We should talk about prices for next year, because it is my belief that UDC prices must be below $65.00 next year; any price above that mark should be ignored by customers, and I would be happy to explain why.""

Ridgewood states that the total power production capacity of QFs in  California is approximately 9,000 MWs, of which, between 4,000 and 5,500 MW  are from qualifying cogeneration facilities (Cogeneration QFs) and the  remainder from small power production facilities (Small Power QFs).   Ridgewood states that the Cogeneration segment of the industry is  underutilized because of operating efficiency and other QF requirements.    With a limited waiver or other equivalent relief, Ridgewood states that these  underutilized resources could help relieve current shortages during both peak  and off-peak periods.  Ridgewood estimates that as much as 1,000 MWs would be  immediately available by allowing QFs to sell to the purchasing utility or  into the competitive market their ""above-baseline"" output for a limited time  period.   Ridgewood suggests that any such sale would be made at market-based  rates and would not be subject to the operating and efficiency  standards......... Section 292.205(c) of the Commission's regulations  provides that the Commission may waive any of its operating and efficiency  standards ""upon a showing that the facility will produce significant energy  savings"".   However, the Commission has exercised its waiver authority in a  number of cases based on factors such as the limited durations of the  requested waiver, whether further waivers would be necessary, whether the  request was intended to remedy specific problems associated with an  innovative technology, and whether granting waiver would fulfill PURPA's  goals.   We find that many of these same factors are present here.   Consistent with the goals of PURPA, we find that granting such waiver in this  circumstance will provide for increased efficiency in the use of the  Cogeneration facilities and improved reliability of electric service through  increasing the availability of needed capacity.  Therefore, we will grant  temporary waiver of the operating and efficiency standards to Cogeneration  QFs for sales into California, effective as of the date of this order.  We  will terminate the waiver effective January 1, 2001.""   Let me know if you want the entire order.

LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--Edison International (EIX), saying the current state of                   California's power markets threatens the company with bankruptcy, will call Wednesday                   for an end to California's four-year experiment with deregulation, sources familiar with                   the issue told Dow Jones Newswires.                         John Bryson, chief executive of Edison International, is expected to announce that                   the company's regulated utility unit, Southern California Edison, won't be able to                   recover more than $3 billion in losses related to power purchases and continue serving                   its retail customers unless the state's deregulated market structure is scrapped.                         In a move tantamount to a call for reregulation, Edison will propose to break ground                   on new power plants within 90 days and re-enter the power-generation business                   Southern California Edison was required to exit under the state's landmark 1996                   deregulation law, the sources said.                         Edison plans to follow the announcement by filing a request with state regulators to                   increase retail electricity rates by as much as 20%, the sources said, even though                   regulators rejected Edison's request for a rate increase of 10% last week.                         The utility has lined up the support of some state lawmakers for the broader                   proposal, which would require action by the state legislature, the sources said.                         Southern California Edison, with 4.2 million customers, is one of the country's largest                   electric utilities. Edison was the first of the state's utilities to sign on to the deregulation                   effort and, as it says on its Web site, ""played a central role in the restructuring of the                   electric industry in California.""                         Among the concessions won by utilities in 1996 is the rate freeze, which they                   demanded to help them recover costs related to deregulation but which is now                   producing huge losses.                         Edison's current losses stem from an imbalance between the soaring prices it must                   pay to purchase power on the wholesale markets and the fixed rate at which it can sell                   power to its customers.                         About half of those losses are offset the utility's own power sales revenues, which                   are accounted for separately and used to pay down deregulation-related debt. Rising                   power costs have produced a surplus in that account. Edison wouldn't reveal the                   current size of the surplus, but said previously that the California Power Exchange paid                   the utility $1.3 billion over its generating costs for power through the end of September,                   at a time when its power-purchase losses were $2.4 billion.                         Power-Purchase Losses Mounting                           The net losses continue to mount. California's wholesale power prices hovered at                   record levels all summer and spiked even higher in the past two weeks, as colder                   weather arrived in the Northwest at a time when much of California's power supply was                   down for maintenance.                         The price of power for delivery Wednesday in California hit an average of $1,182 a                   megawatt-hour Tuesday, up from $250 a megawatt-hour a week ago, the result of high                   demand and a decision by California's wholesale market operator to lift its cap on prices.                         The rate Southern California Edison can charge its retail customers, however, is fixed                   at $66/MWh.                         Last week, Merrill Lynch & Co. (MER) downgraded its ratings for Edison                   International and PG&E Corp. (PCG), the parent of California's other major utility, Pacific                   Gas & Electric, to neutral, saying the utilities may be forced to file for bankruptcy if the                   state doesn't allow them to raise their retail rates.                         A Morgan Stanley Dean Witter (MDW) analyst drew the same conclusion Monday,                   also cutting his rating to neutral.                         Edison to this point has kept its power-purchase losses off its earnings statement, in                   hopes that a political or regulatory solution will allow them to be collected later.                         The California Public Utilities Commission put the hope of such a solution further out                   of reach last week, however, when it ruled against rate increases sought by Edison and                   PG&E.                         Credit rating agency Fitch Inc. on Monday lowered its ratings for Edison                   International and Southern California Edison's senior unsecured debt to the A-minus                   level, citing ""increased liquidity pressure"" and uncertainty about the utilities' ability to                   recover the costs of their power purchases. The agency downgraded Edison                   International, the parent, because half its consolidated cash flow is provided by                   Southern California Edison.                         Edison - which sources said plans to remain in the retail electricity business - said                   late last week that it has secured a $1 billion line of credit and expects to have enough                   cash on hand to continue to pay for wholesale electricity for the next several months.                         California paid more than $1 billion for power last week, sources said. Some of that,                   however, was paid to Southern California Edison, which still generates about 2,800                   megawatts of power in the state.                         Shares in Edison International have fallen 21% over the past three weeks. They                   closed Wednesday at $18.56, down $0.06.                         -By Jason Leopold, Dow Jones Newswires; 323-658-3874;                   mailto:jason.leopold@dowjones.com(Mark Golden contributed to this article.)

The  power generation facility will be located in Kern County, California, and will bring both short- and long-term generation capacity to the state, which is in  dire need of new power generation.   ""From the onset of the California power crisis, we have sought to find means to bring new power to the California market,"" said John E. Bryson,  chairman and CEO of Edison International. ""This CEC approval will help ensure that this critical new project will be able to provide a significant amount  of new peaking power to the state as soon as next August. Our thanks and appreciation go to the California Energy Commission, and the  environmental and regulatory agencies for their swift consideration of this important project.""   ""This power has been offered by contract to the state so that the pricing for it does not depend on California's broken deregulated power market,"" said  Alan J. Fohrer, president and CEO of EME. ""Alternatively, EME will seek to enter into a long-term, cost-based contract with either Pacific Gas &  Electric Company or San Diego Gas & Electric Company to further ensure that California's consumers reap the benefit of this additional power  resource,"" Fohrer said.   The Sunrise Power Project will be completed in two phases. Phase 1 will consist of a 320-megawatt (MW), simple-cycle peaking facility scheduled to  be in service during the summer 2001. Phase 2 will convert the peaking facility to a 560-MW, combined-cycle operation with an in-service date of  summer 2003. The project will meet or exceed all pertinent environmental and safety standards.   Final regulatory approvals have been received for Phase I of the project only.   EME will be seeking expedited permitting approval for the Phase II expansion in line with the fast-track approval process recently enacted by the  California legislature.   EME has also negotiated an agreement with the labor unions for an adequate supply of highly skilled labor in order to achieve an accelerated  construction schedule. The accelerated schedule is aimed at providing this additional power to California by next summer.   Edison Mission Energy specializes in the development, acquisition, construction management and operation of global power production facilities. As  one of the world's leading global power producers, Edison Mission Energy owns nearly 23,000 megawatts of generating capacity, including interests in  75 projects currently under construction or operating in Australia, Indonesia, Italy, New Zealand, Puerto Rico, Spain, Thailand, Turkey, the United  Kingdom and the United States.

Having worked with many trade groups over the years, including API, IPAA, SGA, AGA and the various Mid-Continent O/G assns. as a lobbyist and from a public affairs standpoint, know a weak assn. does one no good in the long run. It's imperative that the stronger members drive the process.  Unfortunately, arriving at consensus is far from easy, and many trade groups would rather let the individual companies get out front because the assn. can't reach consensus among its wishy-washy members.  We've had to do that somewhat in Calif. and have been working very hard with selected media on our own to educate them since the issue arose in the summer.

This notices requests Market Participants to treat the detailed data request issued by the State Auditor as confidential.  In addition this notice updates Market Participants on the ISO's schedule for compliance with the State Auditor's subpoena and data request.  The December 4 notice included a detailed data request.  The State Auditor has informed the ISO that it considers the detailed data request to be a confidential document and has asked the ISO to inform Market Participants that received the detailed data request that they should treat the document as confidential.  The ISO hereby informs Market Participants on behalf of the State Auditor that the detailed data request should be treated as a confidential document.  The December 4 notice indicated that the ISO will seek protection for information subject to Section 20.3.4 under the Confidentiality Agreement executed by the ISO and the Bureau. The notice requested that any concerns relating to the Bureau's subpoena and/or document request be communicated to the ISO by 9:00 a.m., December 8th. In response to the notice, several market participants have objected to disclosure of confidential information to the Bureau.   Section 20.3.4 of the ISO Tariff provides, in pertinent part, that: ""The Market Participant may, at its sole discretion and own cost, direct any challenge to or defense against the disclosure requirement and the ISO shall cooperate with such affected Market Participant to the maximum extent practicable to minimize disclosure of the information consistent with applicable law."" In accordance with that provision, objecting Market Participants have the responsibility to pursue more restrictive confidentiality protections to the extent they are disatisfied with the protections in place.  Accordingly, the ISO through this notice places Market Participant's on notice that it will release confidential information requested by the State Auditor by the end of this week, if it does not receive an order to the contrary from a Court or the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission by close of business Thursday December 21.

"If you  haven't seen it.  Got this from a WAPA guy through WPTF.  PROPOSED ACTION STEPS AGREED TO AT DENVER EMERGENCY MEETING ON DECEMBER 20,  2000   1. Action in California. The governors call upon California to redouble its  efforts to conserve electricity and to stabilize prices and its electric  power market.   2. FERC Investigation. The governors thank Chairman Hoecker for his offer of  assistance and ask that his staff prepare an immediate report on the implications and potential consequences of regional price caps and bilateral  contracts, and to investigate: why Western electricity prices have been so  high; who has benefitted from these high prices; and whether generating capacity has  been held back. This information will be useful whatever the individual  governors views on these matters.   3. Energy Conservation. The governors commit to and ask their western  gubernatorial colleagues to join them in implementing a coordinated,  state-by-state, voluntary conservation strategy to free up electricity in the West starting  no later than January 1. This plan would encourage consumers at every scale  to reduce or reschedule electricity demand and would encourage state public service  commissions to review and adopt other steps such as mechanisms to pay users  for forgoing power during times of high demand. Furthermore, the governors agree  and ask their western gubernatorial colleagues to join them in reducing the electricity consumed by public agencies in their states. The states will  coordinate an energy conservation response by December 28.   4. Presidential Task Force. The governors call upon their colleague  President-elect Bush to convene a formal team to work with the western  governors on this urgent issue while waiting for appointments to be made.   5. Increasing Supply. The governors will convene in late January or early  February a meeting of all the affected parties to prepare a vision and action  plan for the west's energy future and its relation to a national energy policy,  including increasing the supply and availability of electricity and energy  throughout the region today and in the future. The governors called for this meeting at the winter  2000 meeting of the Western Governors' Association; due to the current energy crisis they have fast-tracked this meeting and the development of a  hemispheric energy policy.

"Here is another hefty ISO  filing that came in this week.  Please let Sue o= r=20 I know if you believe we should intervene/protest.  Alan Comnes  Summary of ISO Amendment 34:  Filed: December 28  Effective Date: 1/1/01 (expedited treatment requested)  Protests Due: January 17? (need to confirm this)  Filing in a Nutshell: The ISO states that the purpose of the amendment is t= o=20 clarify certain issues associated with implementation of the new transmissi= on=20 Access Charge methodology it orginally proposed in Amendment No. 27.=20 (According to the ISO, Amendment 27 has been accepted for filing, suspended= ,=20 and set for hearing.  Settlement negotiations are ongoing.  (Is Enron a par= ty=20 to these settlements?)) In addition, the ISO provides new transmission Acce= ss=20 Charge (TAC) rates that will be in effect if the Commission approves the Ci= ty=20 of Vernon joining the ISO effective January 1, 2001 and the amount of Firm= =20 Transmission Rights that will be given to Vernon in accordance with the ISO= =20 Tariff.  Specific Proposed Changes  Clarification of Wheeling Access Charge Quantity  The ISO proposes that these provisions be clarified to specify that in the= =20 determination of the Wheeling Access Charge, the proper calculation is to u= se=20 transmission facility ownership and Entitlements less all Encumbrances. =20 Encumbrances include transmission used to meet demands of existing=20 contracts.  This is how the ISO is currently calculating this charge and th= e=20 ISO appears to be using this filing to codify this method.  New HV TAC Rates Using Year-1 of the ISO=01,s Proposed Transmission Methodo= logy  The current Access Charge methodology consists of three separate zone rates= =20 based on the Transmission Revenue Requirement of the Original Participating= =20 TO.  Because each zone corresponds to the service territory of the TO, they= =20 are known as =01&license plate=018 rates.  Under Amendment No. 27, this met= hodology=20 continues in effect until a New Participating TO joins the ISO.  Once that= =20 occurs, the Access Charge for High Voltage Transmission Facilities will be= =20 assessed based on the combined High Voltage Transmission Revenue Requiremen= ts=20 of all the Participating TOs in each TAC Area.  The filing claims to implement an already-approved transition formula where= in=20 new members of the ISO will pay a rate that is a mix license place and syst= em=20 average embedded costs.  The goal is that after 10 years there will be only=  1=20 high voltage access charge. The following table shows that under the curren= t=20 method, which would be a 90/10 split of license-plate/system-average charge= s,=20 PG&E and SCE TO access charges would rise approximately $3.2 million and=20 Vernon would be subsidized approximately $7 million.  Calculation of the net (benefits)/burdens from Access Charge and GMC Impact= . =20  PG&E and SCE have a $32 Million cap annually and=20 SDG&E has a $8 Million cap annually; Vernon is held harmless; I OUs pay muni cost increases in proportion to their cap relative to the tota= l=20 cap.=09Adjusted =09Net =09(Benefit)/ =09Burden =09($1000) =09[37] PG&E=09$3,283=20 SCE=09$3,283=20 SDG&E=09$821=20 Vernon=09($7,051)   Total=09$336=20 =09 =09 =09Note: a positive number means the TAC is going up.  A negative number me= ans=20 the TAC is going down (or will be lower than would be the case under 100%= =20 license plate ratemaking)   Vernon=01,s Existing Transmission Rights Converted to FTRs  Veron, by joining the ISO effective 1/1/01, agrees to convert existing=20 transmission rights to FTRs of presumably an equivalent amount.  The propos= ed=20 FTRs to allocate to Vernon are in the filing.  These FTRs will expire when= =20 the underlying contract right expires or 10 years, whichever is sooner.

"In the Room  Conference attended by all in-state generators, a few munies, the IOUs and a  few others. One attorney from CPUC, but on phone. Barbara Barkovich attended  for CA Large Consumers.  Nader sent someone.  No other consumers.  One other  ESP -- Strategic Energy (only operates in San Diego). Judge reports that only 6 offers have been submitted to FERC for sales to the  IOUs (note; Enron submitted one of the offers). The offers total 2000 MW. The  prices are quite divergent.  He expresses concern at the little offered. Generators suggest that more could be offered if FERC could be more flexible  on terms (FERC required 24/7 offers). IOUs and others press judge to seek offers from others not present (e.g.,  BPA, other marketers, SW utilities), but judge does not offer to do so. Barkovich says can't throw large customers into non-core market now. Everyone agrees that we are all looking for a blended wholesale rate (part  existing gen, part OFs, part forward contract and part spot) that meshes with  the IOUs' ability to recover the costs in rates -- so tied to CPUC rate  increase. Discussion of CPUC PD -- not enough Enron able to take low profile. SDG&E suggested terminating the settlement talks at FERC, saying nothing  could be achieved. Not much happens until 4:30 pm, when judge blows up -- judge directed  epithets at SDG&E and SCE.  SCE had refused to cooperate from the beginning.    Out of the Room  Separate talks between PG&E and SDG&E and some of the generators. Late in the day, Judge meets with IOUs. Parties agree informally that forum does not work well given lack of CPUC  involvement, but some believe that FERC is only hope for a workable  resolution.  Next Steps -- The Judge Speaks  Judge asked everyone to consider how to ""Share the Pain"" for Thursday's  meeting and said not to expect any ""win:win"" scenario. His view is that FERC  is better than the CA legislature or bankruptcy court. His focus will be on Wolak proposal to share the pain, as submitted in  12/1/00 comments to FERC -- forces all sellers to CA to sell most of its  supply (either generation or marketer offers) as cost-based rates in forward  contracts, or lose ability to sell at market-based rates.  Generators oppose  this, I believe. Enron planning to continue low profile but to discuss options with ENA.","alan.comnes@enron.com, angela.schwarz@enron.com, beverly.aden@enron.com,   bill.votaw@enron.com, brenda.barreda@enron.com,   carol.moffett@enron.com, cathy.corbin@enron.com,   chris.foster@enron.com, christina.liscano@enron.com,   christopher.calger@enron.com, craig.sutter@enron.com,   dan.leff@enron.com, debora.whitehead@enron.com,   dennis.benevides@enron.com, don.black@enron.com,   dorothy.youngblood@enron.com, douglas.huth@enron.com,   edward.sacks@enron.com, eric.melvin@enron.com, erika.dupre@enron.com,   evan.hughes@enron.com, fran.deltoro@enron.com,   frank.vickers@enron.com, gayle.muench@enron.com,   ginger.dernehl@enron.com, gordon.savage@enron.com,   harold.buchanan@enron.com, harry.kingerski@enron.com,   iris.waser@enron.com, james.steffes@enron.com, james.lewis@enron.com,   james.wright@enron.com, jeff.messina@enron.com,   jeremy.blachman@enron.com, jess.hewitt@enron.com,   joe.hartsoe@enron.com, karen.denne@enron.com, kathy.bass@enron.com,   kathy.dodgen@enron.com, ken.gustafson@enron.com,   kevin.hughes@enron.com, leasa.lopez@enron.com,   leticia.botello@enron.com, mark.muller@enron.com,   marsha.suggs@enron.com, marty.sunde@enron.com,   meredith.eggleston@enron.com, michael.etringer@enron.com,   michael.mann@enron.com, michelle.cisneros@enron.com,   mike.smith@enron.com, mpalmer@enron.com, neil.bresnan@enron.com,   neil.hong@enron.com, paul.kaufman@enron.com, paula.warren@enron.com,   richard.zdunkewicz@enron.com, richard.leibert@enron.com,   richard.shapiro@enron.com, rita.hennessy@enron.com,   robert.badeer@enron.com, roger.yang@enron.com,   rosalinda.tijerina@enron.com, sandra.mccubbin@enron.com,   sarah.novosel@enron.com, scott.gahn@enron.com,   scott.stoness@enron.com, sharon.dick@enron.com, skean@enron.com,   tanya.leslie@enron.com, tasha.lair@enron.com, ted.murphy@enron.com,   terri.greenlee@enron.com, tim.belden@enron.com,   tony.spruiell@enron.com, vicki.sharp@enron.com,   vladimir.gorny@enron.com, wanda.curry@enron.com,   william.bradford@enron.com, mike.smith@enron.com,   donna.fulton@enron.com, jeff.dasovich@enron.com,   richard.sanders@enron.com, gfergus@brobeck.com,   rcarroll@bracepatt.com, kathryn.corbally@enron.com",susan.mara@enron.com,Update Day 1 Second Session FERC CA Settlement,2001-01-03 14:40:00-08:00,sent
"In the Room  PG&E presented its ""Share the Pain"" proposal:  --  Each party allocated a share of the utilities' unmet load (4,000 MW of  PG&E and 8,000 MW for SCE)  --  Allocation based on the volume of sales made to ISO and PX in 3rd and  4rth Q of 2000 (% of total)   and ""profits"" received.  ""Profit"" allocation would be returned as discounts  to the utilities for 2001   and 2002. Judge would determine whether allocation of ""profit"" was fair for  each party.  --  Those who participate retain market-based rates for all other sales.  --  Those who don't .......?  Not clear what can happen.  PG&E suggested  lose market power license,   which was very negatively received by all marketers.  --  PG&E says go along because otherwise we won't pay you the $2 billion we  owe right now. Enron responded publicly that it wants to work in this process and be  positive, but utilities would need to  provide MAJOR quid pro quo for this, such as release from legal liability  and auctioning off retail load --  and how does this work with so many  parties missing from the room (i.e., Governor, CPUC, Legislature,  BPA,  PowerEX, etc.) Marketers met separately with the Judge. Avista, Morgan Stanley, PG&E  National Energy Group, Strategic Energy, BP, Merrill Lynch. Explained that  PG&E's offer did not work for marketers -- no owned assets, can't have  obligation to buy in the market and sell to the utilities at a loss. We point  out that we did not come in good faith to ""write a check"" -- that was not the  stated intent of the discussions  Out of the Room  More talks between PG&E and SDG&E and some of the generators; SCE still on  the sidelines. Late in the day, Judge meets with IOUs and gens for two hours. Reporters hover at door and try to get info from those coming and going.  Next Steps -- The Judge Speaks Again  Judge annuounces the generators are working on spreadsheets to come up with  the dollars for a workable proposal. Asks people to return Friday, 10:00 am.   Does not address how this proposal would effect marketers -- tells us to talk  to the generators. Announces that he intends to ""send a signal to the financial markets  tomorrow."" He seems to want to take these unusual steps in spite of these  confidential settlement discussions -- to help the utilities and as he said,  ""buy us some time."" Judge asks ISO and PX to provide the name of each Scheduling Coordinator  selling to the ISO and PX markets and the amount sold by each.  Goal-- to  find  out who has what market share (and, I suspect, later, the biggest  chunck of ""profits') Don't know how long this will take.  I suggest two weeks. Judge says when he gets this info, he will know what other parties to  ""encourage"" to be in the room.  Discussions with Reliant  John Stout from Reliant seems to be taking the lead for the gens. John understands that Power EX and BPA will not sell to California below  market.  He understands that marketers have the same problem. He claims to be working toward the buckets I mentioned yesterday -- so some  people sell at market and some have lower-priced (and I presume  longer-termed) forward contracts. He promises to have something to share  (with all the parties) tomorrow at 10 am. John wants for us all to reach some agreement on Friday and be able to say to  Governor Davis that we have solved the wholesale price problem long-term --  but to make this work, you need to raise retail rates by an additional  X%  (he thinks another half a cent might do it). Then Governor Davis can  incorporate this into his State of the State address on January 8.

"Next Steps  Resumes 1/10/01 in WDC.  Enron will continue to attend.  In the Room  Reliant submitted its proposal for blended rates and determining the real gap  between a blended wholesale price and potential retail rates. Reliant showed  that the gap is potentially quite small. Reliant's effort was to move us away from the ""Sharing the Pain"" concept  offered by PG&E. Enron again requested utility ideas for a quid pro quo, assuming any deal  could be struck. Judge requested additional info from ISO and PX on market shares -- several  marketers explained their concern (e.g. Morgan Stanley, Merrill Lynch,  Avista) that this request gave credence to the ""Pain"" allocation proposal and  refused to give permission to release their data.  Enron said it was checking  on whether to release the data, but had the same concerns as the other  marketers on the principles. Judge decided to use a joint statement for his report (see attached) to the  public. The statement was agreed to, in large part, by the participants. Judge mentioned that 40% of the A/S market is apparently held by three  municipal/alien utilities.  Judges order urges participation by these parties.   Out of the Room  More bilateral discussions between utilities and gens. Marketers discuss whether to continue to stay in the room and participate.

They still can if the CPUC  rules that the value of their assets exceed the shortfall.  Can you tell me what the significance of this ruling is??

ROSEMEAD, Calif., Jan. 8, 2001--SCE applauded                   today's decision by U.S. District Court Judge                   Ronald S.W. Lew upholding the central claim of our                   lawsuit against the California Public Utilities                   Commission (CPUC)--our right to recover the                   reasonable costs of purchasing power for our                   customers. This ruling is an important step toward                   rebuilding the financial stability of California's                   electric power system.                    The court found that a trial is needed on the                   question of whether SCE's purchases were prudent.                   We believe we will prevail on that issue too because                   the CPUC has repeatedly held that purchases                   made through California's Power Exchange and                   Independent System Operator are, by definition,                   reasonable. We will work with the CPUC to                   implement a schedule for the reasonable recovery                   of our costs.                    We filed the lawsuit on Nov. 15 asking the federal                   court to overturn rulings by the CPUC that illegally                   prevent it from the reasonable recovery of operating                   costs for purchasing power it has been forced to                   incur on behalf of our customers. We believe that                   the five members of the commission violated                   federal law when, after requiring us to procure                   wholesale power for its customers from the state's                   newly deregulated wholesale market, and to sell it                   without markup, the commission blocked us from                   recovering the full cost of doing so.                    Our lawsuit was made necessary by the                   commission's refusal over the past eight months to                   heed warnings that its policies breach federal law                   and unfairly place the company and our customers                   in jeopardy.                    In the lawsuit, we noted that we incurred                   ""undercollections"" (the difference between                   out-of-control wholesale power costs and frozen                   retail rates) approaching $5 billion that have                   seriously weakened our financial integrity and                   service reliability.                    This suit is one of many steps we are taking to                   attempt to remedy serious market problems that                   threaten the ability of the state's major utilities to                    continue serving their customers. We are pursuing                   every possible means of protecting our customers                   and shareholders from California's dysfunctional                   electricity market.                                     ###                    An Edison International company, Southern                   California Edison is one of the nation's largest                   electric utilities, serving a population of more than                   11 million via 4.3 million customer accounts in a                   50,000-square-mile service area within central,                   coastal and Southern California.  --     ",susan.mara@enron.com,scott.stoness@enron.com,FW: SCE news release -- Judge finds for SCE in Court,2001-01-09 06:25:00-08:00,received
I'll do my darnedest.  Is Jan handling this poorly or well?,susan.mara@enron.com,jeff.dasovich@enron.com,"Re: Conference Call January 10, 2001- Can you partici[ate",2001-01-09 14:41:00-08:00,received
"High-level meetings took place between officials of the Clinto  Administration, Governor Davis and other parties on Tuesday night (Ken Lay  and Rick Shapiro attended for Enron). The parties agreed to continue the CA  talks at Treasury and to suspend the FERC process.  The FERC chief judge and  FERC staff attended the meetings at Treasury on Wednesday.  The Tuesday  meeting is called the meeting of ""principals.""  Apparent   Process Tuesday meeting gave two assignments to us.    (1)  Develop framework for auction for long-term contracts and resolving QF  issues  (2)  Develop framework for dealing with utility debt, including supplier  ""forbearance""  Long-term contracts--Attended by Sue Mara  -- After much debate, divided into three subgroups:   (a) Timeline/Implementation   (b) Utility Needs/Product definition/RFP development   (c) Standard Contract Development  -- Timeline -- I was the lead and we completed our assignment.  We agreed on  an aggressive schedule   with power flowing by 2/1/01.  The process is set up  for DWR, working with a consultant.  It's an   RFP rather than an auction  process. The idea of a  mock auction was rejected.  --  Product definition -- Much work needed here.  Major issue set forth  below.  -- Contract -- Most parties (including Enron) want to use the EEI standard  contract.  Group working on   additional provisions.  Plan final contract by  Friday. Utility Debt -- Attended by Sarah Novosel  -- Report later  Major Issues from Long-Term Contracts  NEW MAJOR ISSUE:  Utilities revealed late on Wednesday that they want the  State to assume the role of their portfolio manager and claimed that this had  been their idea all along.  In their view, the utilities provide a forecast  and the State takes on the entire risk of meeting the unmet load of the  utilities.  They were unwilling to commit to any time frame. Kind of Auction or RFP -- a.k.a What does the Governor really want?  Many  people in the room believe that the Governor was firm in his demand for 5.5  cent power for ALL the unmet load of the utilities.  We spent four hours  debating these issues.  In the end, the parties felt that the best approach  would be to have simulataneous auctions as follows:  -- Separate bids for NP 15 and SP 15  -- RFP 1 -- Suppliers submit bids for more than one product with a blended  price of 5.5 cents.  -- RFP 2 -- (Considered closest to the Gov's proposal) State sets price of  5.5 cents and suppliers compete    on term and volume.  --RFP3 -- Suppliers provide bids for any of the utilities' product needs and  are free to bid any price,    volume or term.  -- All RFPs would be conducted simultaneously.  Parties agree that RFP3 is  most likely to get the    greatest number of bids.    Next Steps Meetings continue on Thursday Plan is to have final documents ready for the next meeting of the principals Principals tentatively set to meet on Friday or Saturday.","alan.comnes@enron.com, angela.schwarz@enron.com, beverly.aden@enron.com,   bill.votaw@enron.com, brenda.barreda@enron.com,   carol.moffett@enron.com, cathy.corbin@enron.com,   chris.foster@enron.com, christina.liscano@enron.com,   christopher.calger@enron.com, craig.sutter@enron.com,   dan.leff@enron.com, debora.whitehead@enron.com,   dennis.benevides@enron.com, don.black@enron.com,   donna.fulton@enron.com, dorothy.youngblood@enron.com,   douglas.huth@enron.com, edward.sacks@enron.com,   eric.melvin@enron.com, erika.dupre@enron.com, evan.hughes@enron.com,   fran.deltoro@enron.com, gayle.muench@enron.com,   ginger.dernehl@enron.com, gordon.savage@enron.com,   harold.buchanan@enron.com, harry.kingerski@enron.com,   iris.waser@enron.com, james.steffes@enron.com, james.lewis@enron.com,   james.wright@enron.com, jeff.messina@enron.com,   jeremy.blachman@enron.com, jess.hewitt@enron.com,   joe.hartsoe@enron.com, karen.denne@enron.com, kathy.bass@enron.com,   kathy.dodgen@enron.com, ken.gustafson@enron.com,   kevin.hughes@enron.com, leasa.lopez@enron.com,   leticia.botello@enron.com, mark.muller@enron.com,   marsha.suggs@enron.com, marty.sunde@enron.com,   meredith.eggleston@enron.com, michael.etringer@enron.com,   michael.mann@enron.com, michelle.cisneros@enron.com,   mike.smith@enron.com, mike.smith@enron.com, mpalmer@enron.com,   neil.bresnan@enron.com, neil.hong@enron.com, paul.kaufman@enron.com,   paula.warren@enron.com, richard.zdunkewicz@enron.com,   richard.leibert@enron.com, richard.shapiro@enron.com,   rita.hennessy@enron.com, robert.badeer@enron.com,   roger.yang@enron.com, rosalinda.tijerina@enron.com,   sandra.mccubbin@enron.com, sarah.novosel@enron.com,   scott.gahn@enron.com, scott.stoness@enron.com, sharon.dick@enron.com,   skean@enron.com, tanya.leslie@enron.com, tasha.lair@enron.com,   ted.murphy@enron.com, terri.greenlee@enron.com, tim.belden@enron.com,   tony.spruiell@enron.com, vicki.sharp@enron.com,   vladimir.gorny@enron.com, wanda.curry@enron.com,   william.bradford@enron.com, mike.smith@enron.com,   donna.fulton@enron.com, mjackso7@enron.com, psmith3@enron.com,   frank.vickers@enron.com, ren@enron.com, lazure@enron.com,   jubran.whalan@enron.com, richard.sanders@enron.com,   gfergus@brobeck.com, rcarroll@bracepatt.com,   kathryn.corbally@enron.com, dwatkiss@bracepatt.com,   bruno.gaillard@enron.com",susan.mara@enron.com,Update -- Third Session -- Day 2 - TREASURY TAKES OVER FOR FERC,2001-01-10 14:31:00-08:00,sent

"Progress  Working Group 1 (WG1) -- Forward Contracts An interim report was prepared from the work done in the various subgroups  (attached) By tomorrow, will have the final ready for the ""principals"" meeting  tentatively scheduled for Saturday. Final will include draft RFP, very agressive schedule ending with contracts  signed by 1/31/01, draft standard contract, utilities' unmet load projected  for 15 years,  and description of four products: 24x7; 6x16; capacity with  monthly take or pays; and swing capacity. The group will likely recommend two simultaneous RFP processes: (1) Davis'  proposal -- what term and volume will you give me for 5.5 cents; and (2) bids  with their own pricing and terms to meet the utilities' needs.   Working Group 2 (WG2) -- Utility Debt Working on a forbearance agreement No more information out of that group Enron in attendence; Houston credit people on Friday.  QF Group This group met for the first time Thursday evening. Expected to try to negotiate less volatile (and lower) QF prices using  long-term gas tolling agreements.  Status of Major Issues from Long-Term Contracts  MAJOR ISSUE FROM WEDNESDAY:  Utilities revealed late on Wednesday that they  want the State to assume the role of their portfolio manager and claimed that  this had been their idea all along.  In their view, the utilities provide a  forecast and the State takes on the entire risk of meeting the unmet load of  the utilities. Rest of attendees oppose this approach.  No progress made. Kind of Auction or RFP -- Seems to be resolved as discussed above.  Absence of Any State Officials -- Continues to concern participants.   Everyone standing firm that no deal can be struck without State buy-in and  relief from litigation and investigations.  Next Steps  WG1 reconvenes at 9am Friday to finish its report and work products. Apparent joint meeting with WG2 at 10:00 am. QF Group reconvenes at 2pm Treasury and others will assess whether Saturday meeting with ""principals""  (CEOs, Governore) should take place. Tentatively planned for 3:30 pm.

"Friday, January 12, 2001  By the end of the day, the Treasury had decided to move forward and hold  another meeting with the CEOs, Governor Davis and various other Government  officials.  Governor Davis refused to come to California, so a video  conference was set up with two locations:  one at DOE in Washington and one  in Los Angeles for the Governor and his entourage.  It was tentatively set up  for 2:30 pm CST.  I have had no reports on the meeting yet. Ken Lay, Steve  Kean and Rick Shapiro attended for Enron.  Long-Term Forward Contracts  Good progress was made and the report was completed by 4 pm.  It includes a  draft RFO, draft standard contract, a table of utilties' needs, products  required and a timetable that would have power flowing by February 1. Participants were fairly pessimistic about the eventual outcome, however,  given the absence of any buy-in or participation by the State of California.

"Auction Doesn't Get Much  A contact of mine at the ISO told me that the auction ""didn't get much"" and  the bids weren't ""at the Governor's price"".  NPR today in SF reported that  the Governor planned to negotiate the price in the bids (reported to average  6.9 cents) to a lower number.  PX Stay  CA Court issued a one-week stay preventing the PX from selling the IOUs'  block forward position (to raise cash) when notified by the Attorney General  that the Governor may want to obtain the value of the contracts.  Attorney General Orders Exisiting ISO Board to Resign  The CA Attorney General notified the existing, FERC-approved, ISO Board  Members by letter on Wednesday (1/24) that he had filed a complaint in court  and expected each of them to tender their resignation by Thursday (1/25).  He  stated that AB5 had superceded the past state law and led to creation of the  new Board appointed by the Governor.  If any Board member fails to notify the  AG today, he will assume that he or she does not intend to relinquish their  position and the AG ""will proceed to serve and prosecute the complaint.""  The  Board meets in Executive Session today. The only rumor I heard was for a mass  resignation. Joe Hartsoe and Ron Carroll report that FERC does not intend to  get involved at this time.  The WPTF is considering an injunction.  Governor Davis' ISO Board (DISOB)  The ""new"" Board met and admitted they know nothing about the details of the  ISO.  The chair is Michael Kahn (he has been replaced on the Oversight Board  by Cary Doan.  The ISO informed the DISOB that FERC was expecting a filing on  Jan 31 describing its market re-design.  The DISOB decided to file a notice  with FERC saying it has a new Board and can't meet the deadline, and  promising a progress report in 60 days.  Board Member Mike Florio reported  thatn Bill Julian in the GOvernor's office had a little group pulled together  to work on completely changing the ISO's market design.

Per your request, I talked to Jeff yesterday early evening. I had been in a meeting with Keeley, Wright, et al after the hearing. Jeff's proposal was not entirely clear to me, but it seemed to focus on specifying an end date for the rate freeze in the Hertzberg bill.  I noted that the focus of the Friday hearing and the subsequent meeting was on how much of the short fall the utilities should be able to recover and agreed that we would probably go from one freeze to another.  Therefore the date of the end of the original freeze is rapidly becoming irrelevant unless it is used to create a back way into the first issue.  This does not seem very likely right now.  Who knows how this will evolve, of course, but there is a sense of urgency, at least in the Assembly.  Take care, Barbara    ",susan.mara@enron.com,jeff.dasovich@enron.com,conversation with Jeff,2001-01-29 04:20:00-08:00,received

"Thursday, February 1, 2001 |    Bill to Rescue Utilities With Rate Hikes Stalls in Assembly    Crisis: Plan that would have authorized state to issue $10 billion in bonds  to buy electricity is rejected by Republicans as a ""bailout"" after the  measure barely passes the Senate.   By JENIFER WARREN, MIGUEL BUSTILLO and CARL INGRAM, Times Staff Writers     Assemblymen wait for late session on the rescue plan for the state's  utilities to resume. From left, Bill Leonard, Bill Campbell, David Kelley,  Robert Pacheco and Fred Keeley, the measure's author.CAROLYN COLE / Los  Angeles Times      SACRAMENTO--Efforts to resolve the state's power crisis hit a serious  snag late Wednesday as the state Assembly appeared unable to pass a bill that  would have authorized up to $10 billion in bonds to purchase power and raised  electric rates for millions of residents.      The bill, which required a two-thirds vote, fell just short, and  legislative leaders scrambled around midnight to see if they could convince  three Republicans to change their minds.      The Senate had passed the bill earlier Wednesday, but after a debate  that was at times bitterly partisan, the Assembly vote came in at  51-27--short of the 54 votes needed for passage. Assembly Republican leader  Bill Campbell (R-Villa Park) was able to find only one member of his caucus  to join him in supporting the bill, which was approved by all but one of the  Assembly's 50 Democrats.      ""I am speaking for myself tonight, not as the leader of my caucus,  because I am not in alignment with my caucus,"" a dejected Campbell said. The  apparent failure of the measure left legislative leaders uncertain of their  next step as they try to stave off bankruptcy for the state's two largest  electric utilities and reassure financial markets that California will be  able to resolve its power crisis.      Despite the stakes, however, the Assembly's Republican minority insisted  that the proposed cure was worse than the disease.      ""This is a bailout and a massive rate increase for the people of  California,"" said Assemblyman Tony Strickland (R-Moorpark), one of the  leading opponents of the measure.      Gov. Gray Davis--who had repeatedly vowed to avoid using rate hikes to  resolve the energy mess--defended the bill as ""essential"" and said Wednesday  afternoon that he would sign it if it passed.      The measure would ""allow us to enter into long-term contracts for  electricity which will greatly reduce the cost of power in the future,"" Davis  said in a letter urging lawmakers to adopt the bill.      In the absence of such contracts, the state is spending about $45  million a day to buy power to keep the lights on.      ""Like it or not, we are in the power business,"" Assembly Speaker Bob  Hertzberg (D-Sherman Oaks) said as his chamber began debating the bill late  Wednesday night.  Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) greets Southern California Edison executive  Steve Frank at committee hearing on the energy crisis.AP      The long-term contracts that officials hope will lower the state's power  costs are now under negotiation, with S. David Freeman, the head of Los  Angeles' Department of Water and Power, representing the state in talks with  power suppliers.      The bonds envisioned by the failed bill would have been paid off by  electricity customers.      To guarantee the bonds--thus making them attractive on the market--the  bill would have authorized the state Public Utilities Commission to raise  rates. Rates for residential customers, however, could go up only if they  exceed their ""baseline,"" or minimum power allowance, by more than 30%.      Southern California Edison calculates that about half of its 4.3 million  customers would have faced a rate increase under the plan unless they reduced  energy consumption. That provision was roundly attacked by some consumer  advocates, who called it a bailout of the utilities.      Still pending are proposals to rescue utilities from the huge debts they  have accumulated in the last several months. Lawmakers are considering a  measure under which the state would issue additional bonds to help the  utilities pay off their debts and in return have the public receive a  stake--through a type of stock option--in the companies. The utilities have  balked at that idea and are pursuing litigation to force further rate hikes  to pay off the debts.      Wednesday's debate was marked by rising criticism of Davis from  legislators, who have accused him of responding sluggishly to the deepening  energy crisis.      Before Davis' letter, lawmakers had griped that they didn't know where  the governor stood on the bill: ""I will not vote for it unless ownership is  declared by the governor,"" said Sen. Don Perata (D-Alameda). ""Either he's for  it or he's not.""      Failure of the legislation came as California marked its 16th straight  day in a Stage 3 power emergency, with electricity reserves perilously low  and grid managers hunting frantically for supplies.      During Senate debate, legislators characterized the vote as a painful  one that they hoped they would not later regret. But a majority agreed that  the alternative--doing nothing--would expose Californians to more blackouts  and force the state to keep buying power at exorbitant prices on the spot  market.      ""Is it a whopper? Is it absolutely wonderful? No,"" Senate leader John  Burton (D-San Francisco) said before his house approved the measure with the  minimum 27 yes votes required. ""Will it help us go forward until we move on  some of these problems? Yes.""      Sen. Debra Bowen (D-Marina del Rey) called the bill ""a measure that I  undoubtedly hate as much as anyone on this floor.      ""But it is far less odious than the alternative, which is to . . . allow  the state to continue--with no end in sight--spending $40 [million] to $45  million a day to buy electricity on the spot market.""      Republicans gave a harsher verdict. ""This is a rate increase, make no  bones about it,"" said Strickland. ""The consensus in our caucus is, no way.""      And Assemblywoman Charlene Zettel (R-Poway) said the debate on the bill  resembled what she had heard about the Legislature's action on energy  deregulation four years ago, before she was elected.      ""It seems to me that back then we made a lot of assumptions, and we were  wrong,"" Zettel said. ""It seems to me we're making a lot of assumptions here.""      Also Wednesday:      * Power officials said conservation efforts have succeeded in reducing  demand by about 1,000 megawatts during peak hours, enough to keep the lights  burning in 1 million homes and sufficient to avoid rolling blackouts for now,  said Stephanie McCorckle, a spokeswoman for the California Independent System  Operator, which manages the state power grid.      * Southern California Edison reiterated that it will not make  electricity and debt payments that are due this week. An independent audit  released Monday pegged the amount due at nearly $800 million. The company  will not make the payments because it is trying to hold on to its meager  store of cash, Senior Vice President Tom Higgins said. Pacific Gas & Electric  has said it will default on about $1 billion in electricity and debt payments  this week.      Clarence Brown, a spokesman for Edison, denounced as ""outrageous"" the  claims by consumer activists that the utility and its parent company, Edison  International, have profited from California's ill-starred deregulation plan.      * An air quality hearing board told Glendale officials it would schedule  a public hearing on the city's request to exceed current pollution limits at  its municipal power plant. Approval would allow the municipal utility to  generate additional power.      Separately, air quality regulators approved a request by Pasadena to  operate power turbines for as long as 1,300 hours a year, as long as they  have or purchase pollution credits. Without the waiver, the city could run  the turbines for no more than 200 hours annually.      The bill passed by the Senate on Wednesday, AB 1X by Assemblyman Fred  Keeley (D-Boulder Creek), was the first substantial action taken by the  Legislature to resolve the crisis that has catapulted California's energy  woes onto the national agenda and spread fears of recession.      The measure's most controversial provision is the approval of rate  increases, which has sparked both ideological and sectional disputes. Sen.  Jim Battin (R-La Quinta), for example, argued that his desert constituents  would bear ""a disproportionate burden"" of the increase because high  temperatures force them to routinely exceed their baseline power  allowance--although their allowance is larger than that given residents in  cooler areas.      ""It's not fair and it's not right,"" argued Battin, who, like all but  three Republican colleagues, voted against the bill or abstained.      Others complained that the baseline system treats single-person  households and those with five people the same way, meaning that larger  families are more likely to exceed the minimum and, thus, face rate hikes.      But supporters called the bill a compromise that would at least provide  some protection for residential consumers. And they noted that low-income  residents would continue to enjoy a 15% discount on their monthly bills. In  Southern California, 500,000 of Edison's customers enjoy such a discount.      ""Under the circumstances, it's a decent bill,"" said Mike Florio, a  senior attorney at the Utility Reform Network. ""It's what had to be done.  It's Step 1 in a long, long process.""      One indication of how long that process will be is that the bonds  contemplated by the measure wouldnot even be floated for months. In the  meantime, the state would have to continue to pay for power out of its  general fund at an undetermined cost. The measure would have appropriated  $496 million for that purpose, but further allocations might have been  needed, depending on the cost of power.      The legislative debates on the bill were marked by sharp criticism of  Davis.      ""No more talking about leadership,"" said Campbell, the Assembly  Republican leader. ""Put up or shut up. . . . Time is running out.""      On the Democratic side, Perata began circulating a ""manifesto"" demanding  that Davis take swift actions, including establishment of a state power  authority that would take ownership of power plants ""in or out of the state.""      The proposal, which Perata plans to introduce today, is a nonbinding  resolution that would express the sentiments of the Senate. Calling the  energy crisis a ""condition of extreme peril to the safety"" of Californians,  it asks Davis to prepare a plan to protect residential and small business  consumers against ""unjust and unreasonable"" rates and immediately convene a  meeting of utility creditors to review bankruptcy options facing Edison and  PG&E.      The governor's office had no immediate comment on the criticism of his  performance. Today, however, Davis plans to unveil a publicity campaign to  encourage consumers to conserve energy. Using radio and television ads  centered on the theme ""flex your power,"" the campaign will urge residents to  shift their energy use to periods of the day when demand is low.      For their part, GOP lawmakers from the Senate and the Assembly unveiled  a package of 15 proposals aimed at bolstering California energy supplies.      Sen. Tom McClintock, the Thousand Oaks Republican who has been working  on supply-related issues for his party, accused the state of actively  discouraging the building of new generators over the last 25 years, resulting  in today's crisis.      ""You either begin a crash program of energy development in this state to  address the supply side or you do what Gray Davis did, which is basically to  say if you bring a generator into the state of California we'll seize your  assets and throw you all in jail,"" McClintock said. ""We think that is the  wrong approach.""      As the Senate prepared to approve the long-term buying bill, a protest  outside the governor's office led to the arrest of two demonstrators accused  of obstructing the doorway. More than a dozen consumer activists yelled  ""shame, shame, shame"" and waved dollar bills as they protested what they  called a taxpayer-financed bailout of utilities.      ""These are multibillion-dollar companies that have the ability to bail  themselves out without our help,"" said Medea Benjamin, a former Green Party  U.S. Senate candidate and one of the protesters arrested. ---       Times staff writers Andrew Blankstein, Mitchell Landsberg and Nancy  Rivera Brooks in Los Angeles and Miguel Bustillo, Julie Tamaki, Rone Tempest  and Nancy Vogel in Sacramento contributed to this story.",susan.mara@enron.com,michael.tribolet@enron.com,Re: LA Times article,2001-01-31 23:30:00-08:00,received

The Commission did not allow PG&E to pledge its electric customer accounts receivable for the same purpose.  The Commission did, however, provide for PG&E to pledge it core gas inventory for the purpose of procuring core gas supplies.  PG&E may only pledge its inventory if  the value of its gas accounts receivable is less than the amount it owes gas suppliers at the time of any particular gas purchase.

Henri, Director of Utility Electric Portfolio Management at Pacific Gas and Electric Co. (PG&E). Mr. Henri stated that PG&E was providing notice pursuant to Sections 15.1 and 15.2 of the ISO Tariff that ""Uncontrollable Forces prevent PG&E from performing all of its obligations under the ISO Tariff.""  Mr. Henri's letter identified ""government regulations and market conditions"" as ""forces beyond PG&E's reasonable control.""  In addition, Mr. Henri stated that the temporary electric rate increase ordered by the California Public Utilities Commission on January 4, 2001 was ""an amount far below that necessary to enable PG&E to generate sufficient cash to pay its ongoing procurement bills.""         Mr. Henri continued by stating that ""PG&E...lacks the funds to pay in full its bill from the Independent System Operator for November power purchases, due on February 1, 2001.""   Further, Mr. Henri stated that ""because PG&E's inability to make full payment is due to Uncontrollable Forces, the ISO Tariff precludes the Independent Service (sic.) Operator from imposing any sanctions against PG&E.""       Mr. Henri concluded by stating that PG&E's efforts to secure relief from these circumstances continue and that PG&E will inform the ISO as soon as it is able to resume making full payment for its wholesale power purchases.       At present, the California ISO neither accepts nor rejects the claims made in Mr. Henri's letter. The purpose of this market notice is to fully inform Market Participants who may have claims directly against PG&E based on PG&E's failure to pay in full ISO invoices.

The department  shall provide public notice when the department has fully satisfied the net  short position of an electrical corporation.  This event shall be deemed to  be the close of the initial subscription period for the applicable electrical  corporation. c) If, after the initial subscription period has closed, a large commercial  or industrial customer elects to leave the department service, the department  may impose a fee equal to the incremental costs imposed on the portfolio that  are directly related to the load of the departing customer. d) Upon conclusion of the initial subscription period, the department shall  notify all large commercial and industrial customers no less than six months  in advance of the lapse of any long-term contract.  Upon such notice large  commercial and industrial customers shall have the right to elect an  alternate provider without being subject to the surcharge set forth in  sub-section (c).  This event shall be deemed to be an open subscription  period and shall remain in effect until such time as the aggregated demand of  all customers electing an alternative provider exceeds the capacity of the  lapsing contract.  This event shall be deemed to be an open subscription  period. e) If a large commercial or industrial customer requests service from the  department after the initial subscription period or outside of an open  subscription period, the department may impose a fee equal to the incremental  costs imposed on the portfolio that are directly related to the load of the  returning customer, taking into account prospects for load growth in its  customer base, compared to the total value of the portfolio of energy used to  serve the customer.   f) Customers that have elected to take service from the department after the  initial subscription period or outside of an open subscription period shall  be required to take service from the department for a minimum of one year. g) Any new customer to the service territory of an electrical corporation  shall have the opportunity to elect service from the department without being  subject to sub-section (e). h) Any new customer shall have the opportunity to elect service from an  alternative provider during the first 120 days from the date of service  initiation without being subject to sub-section (c). i) For purposes of this section, residential and small commercial customers  shall be defined as customers with demands less than 100 kW. j) For purposes of this section, commercial and industrial customers shall be  defined as customers with demands equal to or greater than 100 kW. k) For purposes of this section, a long-term contract shall be defined as a  contract for energy greater than or equal to one-year in length. l) For purposes of this section, incremental costs shall be defined as the  costs that the department cannot reasonably avoid until such time as one or  more long-term contracts expire","alan.comnes@enron.com, angela.schwarz@enron.com, beverly.aden@enron.com,   bill.votaw@enron.com, brenda.barreda@enron.com,   carol.moffett@enron.com, cathy.corbin@enron.com,   chris.foster@enron.com, christina.liscano@enron.com,   christopher.calger@enron.com, craig.sutter@enron.com,   dan.leff@enron.com, debora.whitehead@enron.com,   dennis.benevides@enron.com, don.black@enron.com,   dorothy.youngblood@enron.com, douglas.huth@enron.com,   edward.sacks@enron.com, eric.melvin@enron.com, erika.dupre@enron.com,   evan.hughes@enron.com, fran.deltoro@enron.com,   frank.vickers@enron.com, gayle.muench@enron.com,   ginger.dernehl@enron.com, gordon.savage@enron.com,   harold.buchanan@enron.com, harry.kingerski@enron.com,   iris.waser@enron.com, james.steffes@enron.com, james.lewis@enron.com,   james.wright@enron.com, jeff.messina@enron.com,   jeremy.blachman@enron.com, jess.hewitt@enron.com,   joe.hartsoe@enron.com, karen.denne@enron.com, kathy.bass@enron.com,   kathy.dodgen@enron.com, ken.gustafson@enron.com,   kevin.hughes@enron.com, leasa.lopez@enron.com,   leticia.botello@enron.com, mark.muller@enron.com,   marsha.suggs@enron.com, marty.sunde@enron.com,   meredith.eggleston@enron.com, michael.etringer@enron.com,   michael.mann@enron.com, michelle.cisneros@enron.com,   mike.smith@enron.com, mpalmer@enron.com, neil.bresnan@enron.com,   neil.hong@enron.com, paul.kaufman@enron.com, paula.warren@enron.com,   richard.zdunkewicz@enron.com, richard.leibert@enron.com,   richard.shapiro@enron.com, rita.hennessy@enron.com,   robert.badeer@enron.com, roger.yang@enron.com,   rosalinda.tijerina@enron.com, sandra.mccubbin@enron.com,   sarah.novosel@enron.com, scott.gahn@enron.com,   scott.stoness@enron.com, sharon.dick@enron.com, skean@enron.com,   susan.mara@enron.com, tanya.leslie@enron.com, tasha.lair@enron.com,   ted.murphy@enron.com, terri.greenlee@enron.com, tim.belden@enron.com,   tony.spruiell@enron.com, vicki.sharp@enron.com,   vladimir.gorny@enron.com, wanda.curry@enron.com,   william.bradford@enron.com, jubran.whalan@enron.com,   triley@enron.com, richard.sanders@enron.com,   robert.williams@enron.com, dwatkiss@bracepatt.com,   rcarroll@bracepatt.com, donna.fulton@enron.com, gfergus@brobeck.com,   kathryn.corbally@enron.com, bruno.gaillard@enron.com,   linda.robertson@enron.com, ren@enron.com, lazure@enron.com,   michael.tribolet@enron.com, phillip.allen@enron.com,   christian.yoder@enron.com, jklauber@llgm.com,   tamara.johnson@enron.com, mary.hain@enron.com, greg.wolfe@enron.com,   jeff.dasovich@enron.com, dirk.vanulden@enron.com,   steve.walker@enron.com, james.wright@enron.com",susan.mara@enron.com,PROPOSED COALITION LANGUAGE TO FIX ABX 1,2001-02-05 03:27:00-08:00,sent
"I see no downside to calling the question on California ISO Governance.  The  CAISO staff was ready to move forward on a proposal that was not too  inconsistent with the DStar and RTO West.  As a result, there was a good  chance that seams issues could be addressed before the other two RTOs start  up.  At  yesterday's Western Seams Task Force meeting, the California rep had  to make it clear that everything was on hold until the new political (my  words not his) board was educated.  In addition, the Governor has hired his  own consultants.  It was the California's understanding that the legislation  passed limits the ability of the CA-ISO to agree to any seams solutions  unless endorsed by California State Government.  The current situation seems  to guarantee a stalemate and put an enormous drag on all RTO development in  the West.  It won't get any better if we wait.  It would be better to  challenge now, before this new board starts making decisions based on  political expediency.

"Yesterday, Assemblymen Wright introduced Bill AB 31 X , which seems to be  sponsored by the CA Manufacturers and Tech Association.  It does the following:  1.  broadens emergency variances from air quality reqmts for power plants  under certain conditions 2. Orders CPUC to allow exisiting interruptible customers to participate in  PX and ISO markets. 3. Continues ex interruptible programs through 12//31/03 (currently 3/31/02),  gives annual opt out period. 4. Kicks in an immediate ""bridge program"" for certain existing customers (>  500 kv) with a rate credit.  It's not our demand buy-down proposal, but it's going in the right direction.  Looks good but we need to be sure that DA customers qualify for the  interruptible programs   Proposed Bill on DG below -- is a pot pourri  Probably too  much in it to fly as is.  Sponsored by ""Real Energy"" ( not a positive) and MAY be carried by Alpert. I  offered to work with the sponsor.  ----- Forwarded by Susan J Mara/NA/Enron on 02/06/2001 11:32 AM -----   Julia Wright <jwright@smithandkempton.com>  02/06/2001 09:24 AM        To: ""'Aaron Thomas'"" <athomas@newenergy.com>, ""'Allan Lippincott'""  <alippin@mail.arco.com>, ""'Ann Cohn (e-mail)'"" <cohnap@sce.com>, ""'Ann Watson  (e-mail)'"" <anw@cpuc.ca.gov>, ""'Anna Ferrera (e-mail)'""  <Anna.Ferrera@SEN.CA.GOV>, ""'Art Carter (e-mail)'"" <debinorton@aol.com>,  ""'assistant to John Fielder'"" <moravekj@sce.com>, ""Audra Hartmann (E-mail)""  <ath@cpuc.ca.gov>, ""'Barbara Barkovich (e-mail)'""  <brbarkovich@earthlink.net>, ""'Becky Kilbourne (e-mail)'""  <bakilbourne@calpx.com>, ""'Bill Booth (e-mail)'"" <wbooth@booth-law.com>,  ""'Bill Dombrowski (e-mail)'"" <cra@calretailers.com>, ""'Bill Keese (e-mail)'""  <wkeese@energy.state.ca.us>, ""'Bill Zobel (e-mail)'"" <bzobel@mail.arco.com>,  ""'Bob Foster (e-mail)'"" <fosterrg@sce.com>, ""'Bob Houston (e-mail)'""  <houstgrp@pacbell.net>, ""Brian Kelly (E-mail)"" <brian.kelly@sen.ca.gov>,  ""'Carolyn McIntyre (e-mail)'"" <cmcintyre@sempra.com>, ""'Catherine Hackney  (e-mail)'"" <hacknece@sce.com>, ""'Charles Bacchi (e-mail)'""  <charles.bacchi@asm.ca.gov>, ""'Dan Carroll (e-mail)'"" <dcarroll@dbsr.com>,  ""'Delaney Hunter'"" <dhunter@smithandkempton.com>, ""Delbert Fore (E-mail)""  <fore.delbert@epenergy.com>, ""'Denice Cazalet (e-mail)'"" <dcazalet@apx.com>,  ""'Dennis Price (e-mail)'"" <priced@epenergy.com>, ""'Denny Samuel (e-mail)'""  <dsam@chevron.com>, ""'Dominic DiMare (e-mail)'""  <dominic.DiMare@calchamber.com>, ""'Dorothy Rothrock (email)'""  <drothrock@cmta.net>, ""'Ed Yates (e-mail)'"" <ed@clfp.com>, ""'Eloy Garcia  (e-mail)'"" <egarcia@ka-pow.com>, ""'Evelyn Elsesser (e-mail)'""  <eke@aelaw.com>, ""'Gary Heath (e-mail)'"" <gheath@eob.ca.gov>, ""'Gordon  McDonald (e-mail)'"" <gordon.mcdonald@pacificorp.com>, ""Greg Hardy (E-mail)""  <hardygl@texaco.com>, ""'Jack Flanigan (e-mail)'""  <jackflanigan@flaniganlaw.com>, ""'Jack Gualco (e-mail)'""  <Jackson_Gualco@gualcogroup.com>, ""'Jack Stewart (email)'""  <jstewart@cmta.com>, ""'James Boyd (e-mail)'"" <jim@resources.ca.gov>, ""'Jan  Smutny-Jones (e-mail)'"" <smutny@iepa.com>, ""Jeannie Cain (E-mail)""  <jeanne.cain@calchamber.com>, ""'Jeff Dasovich (e-mail)'""  <jdasovic@enron.com>, ""'Jerry Jordan (e-mail)'"" <jordan@cmua.org>, ""'Jim  Groniger (e-mail)'"" <gronign@texaco.com>, ""'Joe Lyons (e-mail)'""  <joseph.lyons@asm.ca.gov>, ""'Joe Ronan (e-mail)'"" <joer@calpine.com>, ""'John  Bridges (e-mail)'"" <bridgesj@epenergy.com>, ""'John Fielder (e-mail)'""  <fielderjr@sce.com>, ""'John Fistolera (e-mail)'"" <johnf@ncpa.com>, ""'John  Larrea (e-mail)'"" <john.g.larrea@williams.com>, ""'John Rozsa (e-mail)'""  <John.Rozsa@sen.ca.gov>, ""'John White (e-mail)'"" <vjw@cleanpower.org>,  ""'Joseph Alamo'"" <jalamo@enron.com>, ""Julee Malinowski-Ball (E-mail)""  <jmball@ns.net>, ""'Julia Wright'"" <jwright@smithandkempton.com>, ""'Karen  Edson (e-mail)'"" <kedson@ns.net>, ""'Karen Jarrell (e-mail)'""  <kjarrell@smurfit.com>, ""'Karen Koyano (e-mail)'"" <kykoyano@calpx.com>,  ""'Karen Lindh (e-mail)'"" <karen@klindh.com>, ""'Karen Mills (e-mail)'""  <kmills@cfbf.com>, ""'Kari harteloo (e-mail)'"" <klc@aelaw.com>, ""Kassandra  Gough (E-mail)"" <kgough@calpine.com>, ""'Kathy Brandenburg (e-mail)'""  <katherinebrandenburg@flaniganlaw.com>, ""'Kay Grosulak (e-mail)'""  <kgrosulak@sppc.com>, ""'Keith McCrea (e-mail)'"" <kmccrea@sablaw.com>, ""Kent  G.

Deregulation Didn't Foster Competition   By NICHOLAS RICCARDI and STEVE BERRY, Times Staff Writers   The way people scrambled for a stake in California's power market three years ago, you'd have thought it was the second coming of the Gold Rush. Politicians and free marketers boasted that they were freeing millions of customers from their monopolistic utilities so they could shop for cheaper electricity. The state ordered an $87-million publicity campaign, promising a brave new energy world bustling with competition. But those dreams of capitalism unleashed never materialized, dashed by provisions in the 1996 deregulation law that effectively undermined competition and gave the utilities a substantial edge over newcomers. In the end, only 1.7% of the utilities' residential users switched to other providers, many opting to pay more for ""green"" energy. Although the chaos swirling around California's electricity crisis has chiefly focused on soaring wholesale prices, the virtual absence of competition at the consumer level has played a key role in deregulation's undoing. Had competition among retailers flourished, garnering the millions of customers deregulators expected, prices might never have reached today's unprecedented peaks and the turmoil might have been tempered, economists and retailers say.  Retail competition ""would not have prevented a crisis, but it would have toned it down,"" said Richard Counihan, spokesman for Green Mountain Energy, which has returned most of its 50,000 customers to the utilities' ranks. Now even the prospect of competition is gone. A measure enacted by the Legislature last week, which made state government the biggest electricity buyer in California, suspended further retail competition, preventing anyone from underbidding the state. ""That buries us,"" said Tony Wayne, president of UtiliSource of Brea, which, under the new law, can keep its relatively small number of customers but is barred from entering into new contracts. Few thought it would come to this.  High Hopes Collide With Reality Almost 300 firms registered with the state to sell electricity to consumers. Many of them, quick-buck hucksters or small-time operations, were scared off by background checks, fingerprinting and the $25,000 deposit required to enter the market. But then there were the likes of giant Enron Corp., which predicted that the new market would pull 700,000 customers from the utilities in the first few weeks. Another firm deployed 400 salespeople, nabbing residential and business prospects by the thousands. They quickly discovered that the structure of California's landmark deregulation effort erected protective barriers preventing most retailers from beating the prices of the big three utilities--Southern California Edison, Pacific Gas & Electric and San Diego Gas & Electric. For example, deregulation law allowed the utilities to keep their 9 million customers until each took the initiative to switch. Any ratepayer who used a moderate amount of energy and wanted to change companies had to pay $600 for a new meter--unless the retailer wanted to eat the cost itself. In contrast, Pennsylvania, where deregulation has been more successful than in California, requires most of its utilities to surrender some of their customers. Last year, 300,000 customers of one utility were auctioned off to the retailer who could promise them the most savings. All together, close to 1 million customers have switched from utilities to retailers, with savings estimates ranging from a few dollars to $15 per month. In California, the next barrier was expressly designed by deregulation architects to keep new retailers at bay, at least temporarily. Before throwing utilities into a free-for-all, lawmakers felt obligated to give them time to pay off debts that would hurt their ability to offer competitive prices. The Legislature froze customer prices at 1996 levels, well above what the utilities were then paying for electricity. The difference would be used to pay their debts. The hitch for prospective retailers was that their customers--like those remaining with utilities--would be charged the extra amount too. That seriously hurt the retailers' ability to shave prices for their customers without taking a hit themselves. Utility executives say the so-called competition transition charge accomplished its intent: providing some protection against new players until the utilities could shed their debt and compete on an even field. According to those executives, the plan went awry when wholesale electricity prices soared before the special debt charge was lifted and competition had a chance to flourish. ""We haven't had enough time for this market to work,"" said Denise Grant, director of the Edison division that works with retailers. She said Edison expected to lose 150,000 customers annually--a far cry from what has happened. Retailers say they faced other obstacles that seemed designed to help the utilities keep as many of their customers as possible. One of the biggest was a newly created energy marketplace called the Power Exchange. Under the exchange's rules, all buyers--little guys with a few hundred customers and mammoth utilities with millions--paid the same price for electricity. Once again, retailers were stymied in their search for ways to cut their customers' bills. Retailers had no place else to shop for energy because suppliers could make more money selling in high volume to billion-dollar utilities on the Power Exchange, rather than cutting small deals with upstart companies. Wayne, the president of UtiliSource, learned the hard way. He was peddling electricity in California in early 1997, before the state created the Power Exchange. After arranging a good, but informal, deal with a Washington generator, he sent out hundreds of salespeople, took to the road himself and soon cornered 10,000 customers. But the birth of the exchange caused the death of his deal, Wayne said. The generators pulled out when they realized how much money they could make selling on the open market. ""That was an oh-my-god. They said, 'Why should we give you a discount when we can sell it to the Power Exchange ourselves?' "" he said. Retailers say the state protects the utilities in subtler but no less damaging ways. That includes billing customers who switch companies for certain overhead costs of their old utilities, such as weather forecasters and accountants involved in procuring electricity. In late 1999, a coalition of retailers filed a complaint with the Public Utilities Commission arguing that their customers should not be forced to pay costs for utilities they had decided to leave. Earlier this month, the PUC finally reached a decision that favors the retailers' argument but accepts the utilities' calculations of the expenses borne by retailers, an amount critics say is far too low. In dissenting, Commissioner Richard A. Bilas called the decision's paltry award to retailers another strike against them. ""We cannot keep stymieing retail competition if we are seeking rational markets,"" he said. ""Energy service providers [retailers] have left the state in droves. . . . They need all the encouragement we can give them.""  Retailers Found Little Opportunity Be they multinational giants or kitchen-table entrepreneurs, retailers are dismayed by their experiences with deregulation. Enron spent $5 million trying to sell electricity in 1997 and the spring of 1998. But, unable to offer enticing discounts, the firm picked up only 30,000 customers. In a recent meeting with reporters and editors at The Times, Enron Chief Executive Kenneth Lay suggested that the framers of deregulation kept market forces pinned down in the retail sector. As a result, there was little money to be made and little incentive to stick around. ""The more customers you signed up,"" Lay said, ""the more [money] you lost."" Last week, Enron returned a number of its remaining electricity contracts to PG&E. ""In the end,"" Lay said, ""we couldn't change the rules and we pulled out."" On the other end of the spectrum, Paul Oshideri is now a one-man operation since he laid off his seven employees during his unprofitable two years trying to entice customers to Cucamonga Energy. ""You don't have that many options,"" said Oshideri, who is still holding on to his 250 customers and vows not to quit. ""What can you do? You can't do anything right now."" Only when it came to businesses and big institutions such as universities were retailers able to make a dent in the market. The small price reductions they offered translated into huge savings for those large users of electricity. The retailers also offered a variety of other services, including aid to help businesses become more energy efficient. Although fewer than 2% of all residential customers have switched to new energy companies, 13% of industrial users have done so, according to the Public Utilities Commission. ""If they'd structured this differently they would have had households able to make big savings just like industrials,"" said Cal State Fullerton economist Robert Michaels. There is some dispute among deregulation critics over whether legislators designed the law to protect the utilities from an onslaught of competition, or it just turned out that way. Jesse Knight, a former member of the Public Utilities Commission who dissented on the panel's deregulation plan, said the law is biased against retail competition. ""But I don't think it was the legislation's intent to protect the monopoly,"" Knight said. There is general agreement, however, that not enough attention was paid to the mechanics of the retail market. Much of the deregulation legislation deals with generation, transmission and wholesale prices of electricity. The only provisions on the retail end simply allow consumers to shop for deals. Lay, the Enron executive, recalled that the utilities fought hard to maintain their customer base. The irony is that, with wholesale prices skyrocketing over the last six months, buying electricity for all those customers has driven the utilities to the brink of insolvency. ""With 20-20 hindsight, I expect they wish they'd agreed to more choice at the customer level,"" Lay said. ""Then maybe they wouldn't be in the circumstances they're in.""

The purchases by the ISO will then be billed to the state's three  IOUs, two of which are not paying their bills.    DJ Calif/Power Purchases -2: DWR Ducking Its Duty -Reliant  Copyright , 2001 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.     The issue came up in hearings on a lawsuit filed by the California  Independent System Operator, which runs the state's transmission grid,  against Reliant Energy (REI), which wants to be allowed not to sell power to  California if the state won't guarantee that it will be paid.        Reliant is concerned that it won't be paid for power being bought by the  ISO on the utilities' - rather than the DWR's - behalf.        ""We're willing to sell to the DWR, but they're not willing to step up to  the plate,"" said Terry Houlihan, an attorney with Reliant. ""The DWR has money  for short- and long-term power purchases. It can avoid the situation if it  does what the state Legislature said. Then there would be no need for a  restraining order.""        The court issued a restraining order Tuesday night requiring Reliant to  sell power to California Wednesday, then extended the order for another day  Wednesday night.        The rapidly deteriorating creditworthiness of PG&E Corp. (PCG) unit  Pacific Gas & Electric Co. and Edison International (EIX) unit Southern  California Edison first left generators unwilling to supply power to  California in mid-December, when the U.S. Department of Energy intervened  with an emergency order requiring suppliers to deliver spare power to  California on demand.        That order was extended several times, but expired Wednesday.        Last week, the California state Legislature moved to secure the state's  power supplies by passing a bill authorizing the DWR to enter into contracts  to buy power and to finance those purchases by selling billions of dollars in  bonds.        The idea was to shift power purchases to a buyer with better credit than  the utilities. While the bill didn't make the department responsible for  covering the state's power needs, the clear message from the governor, the  Legislature and the DWR was that the department would secure the power the  utilities couldn't buy on their own.        That apparent mission might have been altered in the face of the state's  own mounting power bills, Maviglio said. The DWR has spent $40 million to $50  million a day buying power and has consumed around $750 million since it took  over the job in earnest on Jan. 17.        According to testimony at Wednesday's hearing, the DWR has left it to  the California ISO to cover the difference between the real-time, or  emergency, electricity it finds appropriately priced and what the state needs  to buy to keep the lights on.        The ISO, in turn, has been billing the state's three investor-owned  utilities for power it buys to cover the needs of their customers.        ""In emergency dispatches, the DWR has not agreed to pay a certain  price,"" said Jim Detmers, and operations officer at the California ISO. ""If  the DWR does not agree that it will pay a certain price, then it will not  procure that power. The ISO will be forced to procure it. Then the ISO will  bill the utility wherever the power is needed.""        The utilities have together defaulted on hundreds of millions of dollars  in debt service obligations and power bills, and have said they would already  have run out of cash had they paid their bills on time.        The volume of power left over by the DWR wasn't known.        A spokesman for Southern California Edison said that, to date, the  utility is unaware that it's being billed for ongoing power purchases.  Pacific Gas & Electric wasn't available for comment.        The ISO normally bills for power up to 60 days after it's delivered.        The California Electricity Oversight Board, which oversees the  operations of the ISO, dismissed the generators' concerns, saying they were  threatening to withhold supply to gain leverage to force the DWR to sign  long-term contracts at high prices.        The ISO, however, indicated that credit concerns remain an issue.        ""The credit issue is an ongoing problem,"" Detmers said. ""Some generators  have indicated they would not supply California, because they are not being  paid.""        Steve Fleishman, an analyst at Merrill Lynch, said California needs to  take steps to alleviate those concerns.        ""In the end, there has to be a creditworthy party and someone who is  willing to pay to backstop this situation,"" Fleishman said.        Said Reliant President and Chief Operating Officer Joe Bob Perkins in  letter to Gov. Davis Tuesday night, ""Unless an immediate change in direction  occurs, the California ISO and the Department of Water Resources have set the  stage today for a return to credit-driven blackouts in California.""        The ISO argues that Reliant has contractual obligations to continue  supplying power to California.        -By Jason Leopold, Dow Jones Newswires; 310-666-9986;  mailto:jason.leopold@dowjones.com(Andrew Dowell in New York contributed to  this article.)

Contact: Colleen Beamish, 916-653-4052.  While we have not had time to analyze or digest in detail, here is what Angelides said:  Angelides: Laid out what needs to be done for the Treasurer's office to implement AB 1X and what is and isn't appropriate role of the state for getting the IOUs solvent.   Angelides: ""These will be largest (amount of) municipal bonds issued in nation's history.""  Angelides: Estimated bonds would be in $10 billion range. (This echoes what he said in Jan. 5 news conference)  Angelides: Goal is to arrange short-term external financing by beginning of March. This would account for about $2 billion. If they don't get that amount by March 1, 2001, the State will tap into the General Fund.   (NOTE: This appears to be different from the $2 billion he talked about last month for the renewable energy and conservation load program -- the reserve fund he would use to reduce the intereset paid to the consumers.)  Angelides: It is ""fortunate"" that this is happening when State of California currently has a $5.8 billion surplus.  Angelides: By passing AB 1X, the State has ""provided for stability on a going forward basis"" for the utilities.  Angelides: ""The next step is for the utilities."" -- i.e. - the ball is in their court because the IOUs aren't now in a position where they necessarily are going to be insolvent, so they have decisions to make. Do they want to sell off transmission assets or do they want to pursue the bankruptcy option?  Angelides: ""A buyout, not a bailout makes sense."" because it ""would give liquidity to the utilities.""  Angelides: Announced he was assembling full financing team which would be in place by Friday.   Angelides: Also said that before bonds could be issued, interim steps needed to be taken. Specifically -- that DWR and PUC must reach an agreement on what rates must be paid on power contracts.

"Hey, I like that idea.   Making the State the owner of the transmission  system, on the other hand makes me uneasy.  I hope PG&E was a better land  portfolio that we did at Utah Power.  We had a lot of property, but most of  it had little commercial value since it was either transmission right of way,  substation sites, plant sites or land bought for such purposes where load  never developed.

In the attached article, there is reference to the state taking control of  some Utility transmission asset as a quid pro quo for bailing out the  Utilities  (Senate President Pro Tem John Burton (D-San Francisco), who  argues that California should take control of the transmission grid).  While  our understanding of the current politics is that many politicians don't want  that trade, it is not out of the question.    Having the state take over transmission would make all transmission  non-jurisdictional to FERC within California.  Given that the State really wants ""something"", does anyone have any ideas as  to what these companies may have as a viable trade?   One thought - I  remember reading that PG&E NEG had taken out an option on 20,000 MW of  turbines last year.  Maybe the state could require PG&E NEG to sell (implicit  deal) these turbines at cost to anyone siting in CA?  I'd appreciate any other thoughts that people have.  Not sure where this  issue goes over time, but we need to help the politicians come up with a  better answer than the transmission plant.

By DAN MORAIN and NANCY RIVERA BROOKS, Times Staff Writers  SACRAMENTO--Gov. Gray Davis said Monday he and legislative leaders would have a plan by week's end to avert the bankruptcy of the state's two biggest utilities by trading ratepayer-backed bond money for utility assets. ""The drop-dead date is clearly Feb. 12,"" Davis said. That is when a federal judge is set to hear a lawsuit by Southern California Edison, joined by Pacific Gas & Electric, that could lead to sharp rate hikes for consumers unless a rescue plan is in place. Momentum has been building for a plan in which the state would get control of the utility transmission lines in return for issuing bonds to give the utilities a cash infusion. But Senate President Pro Tem John Burton (D-San Francisco), who argues that California should take control of the transmission grid, said he did not share Davis' urgency to cut a deal this week. The wrangling comes as the state faces the end early Wednesday of what likely is the last federal emergency order requiring that independent power generators sell electricity in California. The Bush administration insists it will not extend the order. ""We're not even asking,"" Davis spokesman Steven Maviglio said. Several such orders issued in the past two months have forced power generators to keep electricity flowing to California, even though Edison and PG&E were unable to pay the skyrocketing wholesale costs of electricity. But the federal emergency orders are less vital now that California has relieved the utilities of having to buy power--at a cost to taxpayers of roughly $45 million a day. Davis, meanwhile, plans to announce today that California has entered into its first long-term contracts to buy power from independent generators, thereby beginning its shift away from the reliance on spot markets. At least one firm, Calpine Corp., was on the verge late Monday of signing a deal to provide the state with up to 1,000 megawatts for roughly 10 years. One megawatt is enough to serve roughly 1,000 homes. The cost could not be determined, but it is believed to be slightly above the 5.5 cents per kilowatt-hour that Davis had hoped for. ""Clearly, we are no longer waiting for someone else to solve our problem or do something to bail us out,"" Davis said at a Capitol news conference Monday. ""We are doing everything within our power as a state to right this ship. We're not waiting for someone to throw us a long pass. We're going to solve it ourselves."" Davis said he will confer with Democratic and Republican legislative leaders this week to resolve the complex and controversial issue of providing ""a cash infusion to the utilities so they can be viable,"" in exchange for utility assets. The Democratic governor said he is not sure how the state will help the financially hobbled companies. It may sell bonds, or guarantee bonds that the utilities might sell. Either way, the bonds would give the utilities cash to help them pay down their debt, estimated at between $6 billion and $12 billion. ""It cannot be done without assistance from the state,"" Davis said. Though Burton favors taking over the transmission grid, Davis supports taking equity stakes in the companies themselves in the form of warrants, similar to stock options. The warrants could be cashed in after the utilities regain their stability and used to lower the cost of electricity for consumers, or to soften future rate hikes. ""That state assistance, no matter what form it comes in, has a value,"" Davis said. ""It is my goal to make sure that whatever the state receives in return has comparable value."" Davis signed legislation last week allowing the state to sell an estimated $10 billion worth of bonds to buy power in the future. The bonds would be purchased by investors, who would be repaid over time by the ratepayers. By selling bonds, the state in essence will be subsidizing consumers for the high prices of electricity in the first year or two. But consumers will pay higher prices in later years when the cost of electricity is likely to drop as more power plants are built. In addition to selling bonds to pay for power in the future, Davis said, the state likely will sell bonds to help the utilities defray the past cost of power. State Treasurer Phil Angelides, who will oversee the bond process, said in an interview that the state had little choice but to sell bonds for future power purchases. But he said resolving the ""past debts of the utilities"" is a tougher problem. ""There is no magic money here. Bonds require a repayment source,"" Angelides said. ""It needs to be a buyout versus a bailout."" The Democratic treasurer said that only after coming up with their own reorganization plan should the utilities seek state assistance. ""At the end of the day, if there are some assets of value that we are interested in as a buyer . . . that should be on the table."" Edison and PG&E have run up billions in debt in recent months as they paid record high prices for wholesale power, yet were unable to pass on the full cost of it to consumers. On Monday, a federal judge in Los Angeles is scheduled to rule on Edison's suit alleging that the California Public Utilities Commission must allow the utilities to pass on the multibillion-dollar cost of buying power. Assemblyman Fred Keeley (D-Boulder Creek), among the lawmakers most involved in the Legislature's response to the energy crisis, said that if utilities win the suit and are allowed to pass on the full cost of their power purchases, consumers could be hit with an 86% rate increase. ""I don't think we can roll the dice and let that happen,"" said Keeley, who along with Assembly Speaker Bob Hertzberg (D-Sherman Oaks) has been pushing for an early settlement of the Edison lawsuit. However, Burton, the Legislature's most influential member, shrugged off the Monday deadline. ""Trial courts rule. Appellate courts rule. Supreme Courts rule, and it's three or four years down the road,"" Burton said. In other developments Monday: * Davis again used his emergency authority to claim $150 million worth of contracts held by PG&E, shortly before they would have been taken by one of the utility's creditors. PG&E had defaulted on payments to the California Power Exchange, and the entity, a sort of commodities market for electricity, wanted to auction off the contracts. Davis took similar action with Edison contracts Friday. The PG&E contracts will supply between 100 and 500 megawatts of electricity for the remainder of 2001. The price of the power will be determined in proceedings before the state Board of Control. But the state may find itself paying significantly more than the relative low prices specified in the contracts. * Edison revealed that one of its bank accounts was seized last month by a creditor, General ReFinancial Products Corp., which contends it is owed $8.8 million for early termination of a financial arrangement during the utility's debt crisis. Edison said in a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that it has asked the federal court that gave the creditor permission to attach the account to reverse course and stop the action. The account, with a New York bank, contains $1.5 million, Edison said. Edison noted in the same filing that it had $1.36 billion in cash on Monday, but has defaulted on several million dollars' worth of debt payments and has ""deferred"" payments totaling $743 million through Monday to electricity suppliers. If the Rosemead utility had made all of its debt and electricity payments as they came due, it would have run out of cash last Friday, Edison said. In contrast, its parent company, Edison International is paying all of its bills. * Shares of Edison International rose 22 cents to close at $13.23 per share Monday and PG&E Corp. fell 14 cents to close at $13.60 per share. Both trade on the New York Stock Exchange. Standard & Poor's, a large credit rating agency, reaffirmed that California's strong rating remains on its ""Credit Watch Negative"" list following Thursday's passage by the Legislature of a bill giving the state Department of Water Resources $500 million more to buy electricity for the state. California's general obligation bonds carry a rating of double-A. * S&P also downgraded to ""D""--or junk-bond level--the ""issuer credit rating"" of the California Independent System Operator, reflecting the fact that the utilities are no longer paying their electricity bills. The downgrade does not affect any operating funds of Cal-ISO, which are generated by transmission fees, and does not include debt issued by the state for Cal-ISO, which retains ""insured triple-A"" and ""A-1 plus"" ratings.

They will be hearing testimony on SB 6x (Burton), which would establish a state power authority; and SB 33x (Burton), which would create the California Transmission Authority.  Attached is a memo from Andy Brown on SB 6x, and I requested something similar from him on SB 33x.  IEP needs to decide what position, if any, it is going to take on these measures.  Also, since last Friday's siting meeting ended-up focusing primarily on SB 28x (Sher) and AB (Wright), participants never had the opportunity to comment on and develop a comprehensive plan for siting issues. IEP has its list of 8 issues (attached) that member developers would like to see in legislation, but this list is incomplete.  As siting bills are introduced and heard, IEP should be able to stand before committees with this template of a perfect siting bill that encourages continued development of electricity supply in California.  IEP may want to consider scheduling a conference call Monday afternoon to discuss these issues with members.

The premise with which the administartion is acting is that if they expeditiously suspend everyone's right to bilateral contracts quickly, it sets up a barrier which the direct access coalition must break through.  In other words the table is set.  Deal your meal from where the dishes are located. I.E. the Davis Administration wants to place all direct access advocates in the position of having to justify why each and every party should be the exception to the suspension rather than have a general rule concerning how direct access should work for all parties.  It clearly gives the Admin a very strong upper hand to control who when and where direct access can occur without having to say that they oppose direct access.  Power be where power lies. ----- Original Message ----- From: Dian M.

( February 14, 2001 )     Feb. 14--SACRAMENTO, Calif.--As Gov. Gray Davis works to craft a bailout plan  for California's two largest electric utilities, California's fledgling foray  into the power business is coming at an ever more expensive price that is  nearing $2 billion.   For the second time in about a week, the Davis administration alerted  lawmakers Tuesday that it needs another $500 million to buy energy on the  costly short-term market while negotiators try to work out long-term  contracts with power suppliers.   That brings the two-month state price tag to about $2 billion, far exceeding  early estimates that California would have to spend about $1 billion to  launch its energy buying program. The news has left some lawmakers worried  that the state is burning through money without making enough progress in  resolving the underlying problems.   With the bills piling up, Davis is looking to present Southern California  Edison and Pacific Gas and Electric with a plan by week's end to rescue the  two companies edging ever closer to bankruptcy. The state was forced to start  buying power because the two utilities have exhausted their credit.   For now, the governor's advisers appear to have decided on state ownership of  the utility transmission lines as the foundation of any deal, according to  sources involved in the negotiations.   In a Tuesday press conference, Davis said he has not settled on transmission  lines, but wants to make sure that the state gets something in return for  rescuing the companies.   ""What I will propose, hopefully this Friday, will not be a bailout, it will  be a buyout,"" Davis said.   Buying the transmission lines has become the most-favored option in the  Capitol in recent days as what one consumer activist called the ""crown jewel""  of any solution. A state Senate committee formally embraced the idea Tuesday  by approving a bare-bones bill that encourages Davis to buy the transmission  lines as part of any utility deal.   Several issues must be settled before a transmission line deal is final. It  still isn't clear what the lines are worth, or whether the utilities will  have to pay capital gains taxes on the lines if they sell them to the state.  And under the law, the federal government may have veto power over any  transmission line deal. But negotiators expressed confidence they can resolve  those issues.   However, the state is still struggling to put together low-cost, long-term  contracts with power companies that are essential to keeping electric bills  close to current levels.   When legislators gave Davis the power last month to sign the energy deals,  they set aside $500 million to tide the state over until it could get the  contracts in place. That came on top of another $1 billion from other funds  that have been used to buy energy that now costs about $45 million a day.   California won't be able to stop spending so much until it signs enough  long-term contracts. But negotiations have been plodding along and so far the  state has managed to come up with only about 500 megawatts -- enough to power  a half million homes.   ""I am starting to get concerned about the pace at which they appear to be  entering into contracts,"" said Assemblyman Fred Keeley, D-Santa Cruz. ""It is  slow and there don't appear to be many of them.""   Davis has released few details about the contracts, but has expressed  optimism that his negotiators will be able to put together enough deals to  solve the problems.   ""No one ever expected this to be a slam dunk because it's a tough  negotiation,"" said Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio. ""But we're making  progress.""   Ultimately, the state is supposed to be reimbursed for its mounting  expenditures in the spot market, under terms of a $10 billion power-buying  bond bill approved by the legislature two weeks ago. The treasurer's office  intends to sell the first of those bonds in May, and their proceeds will be  transferred to the state general fund.   Later bond issues will generate money to be used for the long-term contracts.   Bond investors will be repaid by utility ratepayers, but it is not yet clear  whether that will involve a rate increase.

A snapshot follows:  NEWS CONFERENCE #1 Assemblywoman Carole Migden, Sen. Martha Escutia and others announce  ""pro-consumer"" bill package designed to reduce energy costs and increase  conservation. 10 a.m., Rm. 1190. Contact: Susannah Churchill 448 4516. Also  participating: Susannah Churchill, CALPIRG, and Paul Fenn, Local Power.  The three pro-consumer bills spotlighted:  AB 48X (Migden): Assemblymember Migden from SF introduced her bill, which she  said uses the idea, ""If you buy in bulk, you pay less.""  AB 48X would  ""authorize customers to aggregate their electric loads as individual  consumers with private aggregators..or as members of their local community  with community choice aggregators.""  Assem. Migden said this would give  communities ""independent choices about the kind of energy they wish to buy.""   She also said this aggregation of electrical purchasing would allow  communities to ""pay less than the blended rate"" and would ensure a ""stable  and cheaper supply"" of electricity for these consumers.  SB 18X: Sen. Escutia said that SB 18X would essentially ""re-regulate  electricity for small and core consumers that use less than 500 kW.""  She  also referred to these consumers as ""those who did not ask for deregulation  in 1996,""  but have had to suffer through the energy crisis caused by it.  SB  18X calls for ""re-establishing cost-based rates...to stop the bleeding of the  utilities.""  Consumers (businesses, homeowners, etc.) who use less than 500  kW would be bundled into a core customer group ""like the gas companies do,""  and would have their electricity provided through a ""core portfolio"" of  generating assets owned by the utilities (to be purchased by the utilities  under permissions of the PUC).  Any power generated from these core assets  could not be directed to consumers who use more than 500 kW/day.  SB 17X (Brulte): This bill ""encourages homeowners, developers and small to  mid-sized businesses to purchase and install solar energy systems"" by  providing a tax credit toward the purchase and installation of these  systems.  Senator Brulte did not attend the press conference, but did issue a  statement saying,"" Building a system of conservation and generation is a step  that will play a significant role in ending California's energy shortage.""  Paul Fenn of Local Power spoke in support of AB 48X.  Fenn said that  aggregation would cause ""wholesalers to bid competitively"" to provide power  to these large customer blocks.  He cited the examples of Massachusetts and  Ohio, where ""community choice"" is law.  He also spoke of 400,000 customers in  Ohio who recently aggregated their power and now are served by Green Mountain.  There was a good number of local TV outlets represented, but few print or  radio reporters.  NEWS CONFERENCE #2 11:30 a.m., SACRAMENTO _ Assembly Minority Leader Bill Campbell holds press  conference regarding governor's support of buying transmission line bill,  state Capitol room 3016. Contact: Jamie Fisfis 319-2071.  The Bill Campbell/Republican press conference was very straight-forward and  presented one main theme: ""a buyout of utility transmission assets is really  just another form of bailout."" It was a press conference meant to keep the  pressure on the Governor. No materials handed out.

"Here are two typical comments I've received.  We left our allies hanging out  there  -- not ot mention some of our staff.  From Carl Imparato:   This is very depressing.  And Enron's credibility is suffering greatly (and probably deservedly) in ERCOT and other areas.  Sounds like Ron McNamara and Kevin Presto have turned things around 180 degrees.  My hope is that we (all of the still-unconverted true believers) can nail down RTOWest and DSTAR before Enron can undo all of the successes in those RTOs.  From Elena Schmid, VP, CA ISO  WHat do I hear about Enron giving up on California and adopting PJM?  What  happened in ERCOT?   I've had calls from many people asking me why the CAL  ISO is holding on to this zonal notion when even Enron has given up.   Sue Mara Enron Corp.

Present were ESPs,  consumer groups, business interests, the utlities and representatives from  the Department of Finance, the DWR and Finance's Bond Counsel.  The meeting  was led by Laurence Lingbloom from Senator bowen's office.  Aaron Thomas led off with an articualtion of the AReM/business coalition  proposal. Successive presentations were given by interests who submitted  either correspondence or draft proposals- the details of which can be  discussed in tomorrow's conference call.  Of particular note, and the greatest obstacle facing the future of da, was  the presentation by the attorney representing the Dept. of Finance.  He  expressed concern over broad exemptions from exit fees (ie: all residential  and small commercial customers < 100kw) and broad authority to opt out will  make it extremely difficult to actually sell the bonds.    We need to follow up with Finance, their counsel and DWR to allay their  fears- the sooner the better.  We need to be able to speak their language on  bonding particulars and we need to be able to articulate our position in  terms relavant to their bonding requirements.  We can discuss this further in  the call tomorow.  Finally, Lingbloom said he will circulate a proposal of his own by midweek  next.  The general tenor at the conclusion of the meeting was not good- we  have our work cut out for us.  Until tomorrow.

"Admittedly , ERCOT was handled poorly from a pleading submission perspective,  but there is a legitimate discussion going on within the company that , at  the very least,  will result in a more flexible approach to market structure  and , perhaps( this is my preference) will result in a sharpening and  refocusing of our positions that will acknowledge the necessity for an  ""LMP""-like approach in real-time to achieve sufficient depth of liquidity.(  with a keen focus on developing forward markets in transmission rights).

Enron has  decided to withdraw the filings we made in ERCOT. Our position on the ERCOT  market structure is being reviewed.    Enron continually goes through a process of reviewing its policies to make  sure they are consistent with our business needs.  I can tell you that there  are some strong supporters of Hogan's policies INSIDE Enron now and these  supporters are finding an ear.    Currently, we are reviewing the positions we are taking on market structure  in ERCOT and the east.  We have to ensure we are practical -- from a business  point of view -- and not being just religious about our views.  Probably the  number one concern of the business people is the ability to have a deep,  liquid market for trading.  I believe that much of the discussion has focused  on the ways in which we can achieve such a market.    After our review of ERCOT, Enron may indeed support a PJM-like structure for  the real-time market, but the filings we make will likely not imply that this  approach be implemented everywhere.  I expect that we will be free to support  different approaches in different parts of the country, depending on the  evolution of the markets in each location.  What does this mean for our position in California?  So far, nothing.  We are  standing firm on our California position, supporting the ISO and  stakeholder-approved approach for congestion management, and do not have any  plans to make new proposals. Further, we have the support of the Traders on  this.  Please feel free to call with any concerns. Believe me, I'm having just as  hard of a time working through this as you all are.

Enron, one of the main advocates of the zonal/flowgate model, has a change of heart.  After putting their weight behind the zonal model since 1995, now they are abandoning it unceremoniously. I talked to Richard Tabors today and he confirmed that Enron, his main client, has turned around 180 degrees on this issue. It is all the work of Ron McNamara, a key Enron person in the ERCOT and the Eastern ISO markets. In fact Enron is bringing next week to the PUCT hearings in Texas no other than Bill Hogan himself. ERCOT is way down the path of the zonal model and they have almost completed the implementation of the zonal model, but these recent developments add substantial uncertainty to the final outcome of that market.

John Howard of the OC REgister called me at 8:30 pm last night for the reaction.  As usual, I was totally off guard, but the quote didn't fare badly.  I called my insider at the ISO, and she (is that enough of a clue) told me that this report was discussed in executive session, but not voted on by the Gov Bd.  The report will be on the ISO's website today.  The real issue is DMA wants FERC to keep open the 60-day window, and they are using a simple model (apparently so described by the ISO in the report) to provide some evidence, however simplistic, as to why FERC should listen.  Of course, this will do nothing to help our image.

"ATTORNEY-CLIENT PRIVILEGE  I just spoke with ELena Schmid, VP, CAISO.  She said the ISO report and FERC  filing should be on the web site ""soon.""  Speaking matter-of-factly, she said that their ""60 days"" was about to expire,  so they felt they ""had"" to file at FERC to tell FERC they need more  information.

She said that, primarily, the  filing asks for a Technical Conference, which the ISO has requested a number  of times in the past (unsuccessfully). She said the report never mentions  ""refunds."" The ISO wants to get access to the same data that FERC has or have  FERC do its assessment in a more public way.  I told her how the press was spinning the story.   ""I was afraid of that,""  said she.  I outlined for her how this plays perfectly into Davis' grand  strategy. I asked why the ISO felt it had to file to get the data, when  afterall, this was FERC's job and FERC was doing it.

The original article can be found on SFGate.com here: http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2001/02/28/M N195654.DTL ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Wednesday,&nbsp;February 28, 2001 (SF Chronicle) Energy Experts Belie Davis' Rosy Prediction/Summer expected to be crunch time <A HREF=""mailto:glucas@sfchronicle.com"">Greg Lucas, Sacramento Bureau  Chief</A>      Sacramento -- Gov. Gray Davis' optimistic assessment that California may be on the ""back side"" of its energy crisis flies in the face of what many energy companies and other experts predict.    California's real test will come this summer when electricity usage sharply increases, and unless everything breaks the way Davis hopes, predictions are that large chunks of the state will be in the dark.    ""We're not on the back side of this crisis. This problem is far, far bigger than the governor is suggesting,"" said Gary Ackerman, executive director for the Western Power Trading Forum in Menlo Park.    ""To characterize the problem that way shows a recklessness that feeds on the popular notion we don't have an energy crisis. We do. We have a very serious one that's going to hit us as temperatures and loads go up,"" Ackerman said.    The Democratic governor's comments were made Monday in Washington, D.C., during an East Coast visit aimed at getting Washington and Wall Street support for his energy plan.    He admitted more hard work is needed, but said the state is on the ""back side of the crisis"" because lawmakers have passed bills needed to help lower electricity prices.    ""Does that mean we're home free?"" Davis asked yesterday. ""No.""    But he again repeated that the state is on the back side of the crisis.    That is contrary to predictions by the Independent System Operator, which oversees the state's power market.    On any given day in June, the ISO estimates, the state will fall 6,815 megawatts short of demand. That would put nearly 7 million homes in the dark, if it happens.    In July, the expected shortage is 4,685 megawatts. In August, it's 5,297 megawatts. That's if California has a normal summer. If it's hotter than normal, the shortage grows.    The ISO's estimates tend to be conservative and do not include Davis' conservation goal.    But even if a 10 percent reduction were achieved in June that would save roughly 5,000 megawatts, the state would still be short 1,800 megawatts.    And there are other variables.    Depending on the snowpack and reservoir levels, hydroelectric plants may not be able to run at full bore, which would also worsen the situation.    ""That is something the governor cannot spin his way out of,"" said Sen. Tom McClintock, R-Northridge.    Davis said a combination of new power plants and energy conservation will help the state get through this summer.    The clock is running. The ISO predicts shortages of 3,030 megawatts in May - - just two months away.    ""The real electricity crisis is going to be this summer, and I don't think we've made enough progress there,"" said Severin Borenstein, director of the University of California Energy Institute.    California won't be able to build its way out of the energy crisis by quickly approving and building new power plants, Borenstein said.    The ISO's demand estimates already factor in the new power plants set to come online this summer.    ""Unless we have a very mild summer and have lots of rainfall between then and now,"" Borenstein said, ""we are going to face some serious shortages.""    Like Davis, Borenstein says California needs to do more to conserve energy. Unlike Davis, he favors raising prices on big power consumers to give them an incentive to cut back.    But the Democratic governor may be sending Californians a mixed message.    By telling them the worst is over, he could undercut his plan by making people believe more conservation is unnecessary.    Excluding what lies ahead, there are also plenty of energy issues left unresolved right now.    Although Davis has reached a tentative deal with Southern California Edison on purchasing its share of the state's transmission system for $2.7 billion -- no such deal exists with either Pacific Gas & Electric or San Diego Gas & Electric.    Some alternative energy producers, like co-generation plants, are shutting down because the cash-poor utilities haven't paid them for several months. No cash means no fuel to run the turbines that make the juice.    Generators like Duke Energy and Reliant Energy aren't convinced the crisis has passed.    For starters, both companies are owed in excess of $700 million for electricity bought by PG&E and Edison but never paid for.    ""There are a lot of issues still out there such as how much power your state will require this summer, whether there is enough generation on the ground or available commercially to handle the load if there is a significant spike in demand,"" said Richard Wheatley, a Reliant spokesman.    Harvey Rosenfield, head of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights, has a slightly different take on whether the worst is over.    ""We've said all along it's a crisis inspired by the greed of the utilities and the energy companies,"" Rosenfield said.

"Here are some quick and dirty ideas on the ISO report and FERC filing.  I'm  just reading it, so something more will come later.  Gov Davis is trying to divert attention from his bad public policy ideas.   A significant reason that prices are high and continue to be high is that the  ISO is expecting people to sell when they have no idea whether they will be  paid.   The Governor, the ISO and the EOB have all failed to acknowledge that simple  fact.  When there is a huge risk of receiving payment, a rational seller  would include some risk premium in the price. Like a bank offering credit  cards at higher interest rates to people with shakey credit.  The ISO is not paying its bills and has lost its creditworthy status. THE ISO REPORTAND FERC FILING DO NOT HAVE ONE WORD IN THEM ABOUT THIS CREDIT  ISSUE. The ISO's report evaluates components of sellers' ""costs"" and calculates  purported ""unjust and unreasonable"" prices, all without mentioning the  creditworthy status of the ISO or the risk of doing business with a  non-creditworthy party. Of course, this whole problem could have been avoided or greatly reduced, if  Governor Davis had taken action when it was first identified as a problem in  August, 2000.  Governor Davis has still not addressed this very basic and pressing issue.  His idea to purchase the transmission system doesn't solve the problem and  takes time and resources.  Lots of them. By the way, the ISO's statement that it is entitled to the data is really a  FERC issue and FERC will decide.  FERC did not order this and the ISO wants  FERC to order it.  We don't usually hold press conferences about FERC issues  of this nature. This whole debate/disagreement does nothing to (1) increase supply, (2)  decrease demand or (3) solve the creditworthy status of the ISO or the  utilities. So, why are we spending time on it?

The California Independent System Operator has initiated another attempt to suppress wholesale electricity prices rather than deal with the fundamental reasons of why prices are high.    Like past anti-market moves, Thursday's request that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission slash suppliers' unpaid invoices for December and January power will fail in its stated aim. Also as with past attempts, the ISO's action this week will likely result in higher costs for Edison International (EIX) unit Southern California Edison, PG&E Corp. (PCG) unit Pacific Gas & Electric, Sempra Energy (SRE) unit San Diego Gas & Electric Co. and the state's Department of Water Resources.    The ISO, which is responsible for maintaining the balance of power supply and demand on most of the state's power grid, has suffered the unintended consequences of its actions many times before. When the ISO passed a $250/MWh price cap in the summer, the cap became a target and caused prices to rise, just as the ISO had been warned it would. When the ISO exercised its ability to buy power above its cap only from out-of-state utilities, California generators sold power to the out-of-state utilities, which in turn sold the power back to California at a markup.    The latest attempt to suppress the market is mind-numbingly stupid. The ISO wants the FERC to order retroactive discounts for power it says was sold at unreasonably high prices. Merchant generators, other western utilities and power marketers sold about $3 billion worth of bulk power to the ISO in December and January. The ISO says overcharging accounts for $560 million of that total. Suppliers' prices, which the ISO agreed to pay at the time, exceeded hypothetical generating costs by more than 10% and are therefore unreasonable, the grid manager says.    Actual refunds might greatly exceed $560 million, according to the ISO, once the FERC looks at the suppliers' actual costs. Power from a generating company that bought natural gas before the spot market ran up, for example, should be discounted the most. Generators that waited and paid the most for gas would make the bigger profit per megawatt hour. What a great idea: punish the smart and reward the stupid.    Staffers lead by Anjali Sheffrin, the ISO's director of market analysis, and Eric Hildebrandt, manager of market monitoring, spent a fair amount of time and money to establish this shocker: In a supply-short commodity market, prices exceed producers' costs.    Where they vary from well-established economic principles is that they find this ""unreasonable.""    Sheffrin and Hildebrandt want the FERC to obtain extensive cost data from all suppliers - including government-owned utilities Los Angeles Department of Water & Power and Canada's BC Hydro - and begin hearings on refunds. This would cover the vast majority of sales to the ISO during December and January because almost every seller to the ISO exceeded the $150 per megawatt-hour ""soft"" price cap, above which transactions must be reported to the FERC for possible review.    There is no question the ISO has been paying prices that exceed even the already high market prices. On Tuesday, for example, the ISO paid an average price of $337/MWh for power that other western utilities had bought and sold for $175-$200/MWh. On that one day, the ISO paid almost $25 million for power that was worth about $14 million.    The reason: The ISO has had to pay a premium to the rest of the market since the middle of December, when suppliers correctly figured out that the utilities were running out of cash and wouldn't be able to pay their ISO bills. Once northwestern utilities stopped selling to the ISO at any price, the ISO asked some of the in-state generating companies like Williams Cos. (WMB) to step into the middle on its behalf. Williams did so for what it has called a reasonable profit.    Let's say that Williams bought from some other generator at $450/MWh and sold to the ISO at $500/MWh. That would be reasonable based on Williams' costs, according to the ISO's view.    But if the generator sold directly to the ISO in the first place at $450/MWh, it would be ordered to provide a refund, because its generating costs are assuredly nowhere near $450/MWh.    So, according to the ISO, $500/MWh is reasonable, but $450/MWh is too high.    If the FERC were to order refunds as the ISO has requested, no company that generates power would ever again sell to the ISO. It would always sell to some third party, which in turn would sell the electricity to the ISO at a markup.    Does the ISO ever stop and think through the impact of what it tries to do?    ""We certainly recognize that's a problem, and it's something FERC needs to grapple with,"" Hildebrandt said in an interview.    What the FERC will do is save the ISO from itself. ""We reject proposals to return to cost-based regulation,"" the FERC said in its Dec. 15 California ruling.    The FERC will review some of the high prices, as required. But refunds will be ordered only if the FERC finds that a particular seller to California - or a colluding group of sellers - withheld supplies in order to increase prices, according to the FERC ruling.    But collusion won't likely be found. There have been many investigations into whether sellers have created a ""false scarcity."" None have found it.    In December, Republican FERC Commissioner Curt Hebert, now chairman, applauded the commission's decision to ""reserve 'price mitigation' for real exercises of market power rather than focusing on the price level itself.""    The issue of the ISO and utilities having to pay a credit-risk premium arose after the FERC had decided what it would do about California. But, according to a source knowledgeable about FERC operations under Hebert's leadership, the commission will recognize the credit-risk premium as reasonable.    In the meantime, however, the specter of retroactive price controls and the increased hassle of dealing with the ISO makes suppliers even more reluctant to sell to the ISO. The ISO will have to overcome that reluctance by offering to pay an even higher premium.    Good move.    -By Mark Golden, Dow Jones Newswires; 201-938-4604; mark.golden@dowjones.com      (END) Dow Jones Newswires 02-03-01   1844GMT(AP-DJ-03-02-01 1844GMT)   ",mark.palmer@enron.com,susan.mara@enron.com,"[Fwd: Fun on Fridays, part 2:     POWER POINTS: How To Raise  Electricity  Prices, ISO-Style]",2001-03-02 05:29:00-08:00,sent

The way it  reads, if CDWR is providing 40% of the IOUs' power, the retail customer can  get DA for 60% of its load.  I doubt that will fly -- too difficult to keep  track of and ISO will oppose (only one scheduling coordinator/meter)  A conference call and meeting is scheduled with parties tomorrow on this  language.

"All:  A couple of interested points from the CAISO report, in addition to the good  points raised by Sue Mara:  During December and January, California relied on imports as much as it  relied upon California non-utility-owned generation (p. 18).  Assuming a 70%  capacity factor, the ISO said that in-state nonutility gen (i.e., Duke,  Reliant, AES, Dynegy) is about 2,000 MW and the imports were about the same  over the 55 day period analyzed.  There is no mention anywhere in the report regarding the level of scarcity in  the state--nothing on reserve margins or outages.  Thus, there are huge holes  in the analysis w.r.t. the claim that prices were unjust and unreasonable.

"We have been analyzing various opportunities of providing electric power into  California.  One idea is to modify existing customer emergency diesel  generators such that we could turn them on and supply power to the grid when  the customer does not need the power.  We believe current regulations limit use of diesel (#2 fuel oil) fired  emergency generators to only be operated when the utility is not currently  supplying power to the facility and in that case, maximum of 500 hoursper  year for hospitals and other critical services but only 200 hours per year  for all others.  There may be legislation currently being submitted to the California  legislature or other regulatory body (EPA?) to change this based on current  need for power in that area.

Analytic errors are a prominent feature of the Cal ISO ""Report"" on supply costs (February 28, 2001), and I would be surprised if the same were not true of the FERC order and any supporting analyses that may have been prepared.  (Dan is sending me a couple of relevant FERC documents now, but I will not be able to review them in detail until Tuesday or Wednesday.)  In general, however, it is fair to say that a common set of analytic errors underlies such bureaucratic thinking, and the dangers inherent in the ISO and FERC orders suggest that a detailed refutation is something that ought to be done.  The central points that I believe I would make include the following, among others.  (I'm using a small amount of economic jargon here that I would not use in a report, but I really am quite experienced at making such arguments in plain English.)      1. Such analyses typically are incomplete, in that they ignore (a) a risk premium for non- or under- or late payment.  They ignore also (b) the fact that part of the marginal cost of selling today is the forgone opportunity to sell tomorrow, given that units have to be taken down for maintenance and the like.  In this sense, electricity can be ""stored"" in the form of dispatch availability, and it is in the interest of consumers for suppliers to produce when supplies are needed the most, i.e., when (expected) prices are highest.  This is true even during a stage 3 alert: Suppose, for example, that even greater problems are foreseen for the ensuing summer.  Accordingly, this is not ""manipulation.""  In addition, as explained in my paper in the current issue of Regulation, (c) market prices under competition include a price premium for the provision of optimal reliability.  These three components of cost are important, with measurement requiring econometric and other tools; and they perhaps are impossible to ""verify"" in regulatory methodology.      2. The ISO and FERC analyses confuse marginal and (average) variable cost, average and marginal producers, average and marginal units of production, etc.  Other errors are likely as well: The ISO, and, I suspect, FERC implicitly assume away rising input prices as demand conditions increase.  This would yield in perfectly competitive markets a supply curve steeper and a market price higher than measured ""marginal cost.""  Moreover, the ISO, and, again, FERC in all probability, implicitly assume perfectly elastic supply at whatever input ""costs"" happen to prevail.  That is simply incorrect: In the short run, production capacity is limited, so that even if input prices do not rise with demand, there is a ""kink"" in the competitive supply curve.  If demand intersects supply above the kink=02=05that is, if the amount demande= d exceeds production capacity at the ""marginal cost"" that the regulators measure=02=05price will exceed that ""marginal cost.""  Think about the wholesale market for wheat, for example, which is close to a perfectly competitive market.  In the face of bad weather in some agricultural regions, the market price of wheat will rise, even though ""costs"" for the remaining wheat farmers=02=05labor, insecticide, land rents, fuel, wate= r, etc.=02=05will not have changed, and indeed might actually fall because of reduced demand from farmers affected by the adverse weather.       3. The ISO report admits explicitly that it does not know market marginal cost, because it complains that some suppliers bidding above the ""soft cap"" have not submitted cost data.  Moreover, marginal cost properly defined is for the market as a whole, rather than just for the producers who bid in California.  This means, quite literally, even apart from all of the other problems, that the conclusion of ""uncompetitiveness"" or ""unreasonableness"" cannot follow from the ISO analysis or from what is likely to be the underlying FERC analysis, because price will equal the marginal cost (defined correctly) of the last unit produced in a competitive market.  In short: The sort of analysis offered by the ISO and FERC cannot even in principle determine competitive prices because the regulators lack data for marginal cost for the marginal producer.       4. The implicit definition of consumer welfare (""wellbeing"") used by most regulators is incorrect.  Consumers are interested not in low electricity prices alone, but in a maximization of the value of the entire consumption basket.  Average electricity prices lower than marginal cost reduce consumer welfare by engendering resource use in the electricity sector that is too big, and thus prices in other sectors that are too high.  Moreover, price controls of whatever form must create shortages even in markets with inelastic demand, and the true price with a shortage is unambiguously higher than the price that would clear the market in the absence of the controls.  (Think about the ""cost"" of electricity during a blackout.)  This is easy to demonstrate analytically.      The ISO and FERC clearly are shunting aside the effects of price controls masquerading as ""refunds"" upon long run expectations and other parameters, which easily can be shown to make consumers worse off over time.  Part of this problem is the creation of an asymmetric distribution of expected returns, since suppliers clearly will not be subsidized when prices are low.       5. The ISO errs in its assumption that bids above the soft cap reflect higher capital costs.  I would not be surprised if FERC is making a similar error.  Capital costs, having been sunk, cannot affect short run pricing; the differing engineering efficiencies of generating units will be reflected in their market values, and thus the opportunity cost of production.  This means, in a strict textbook sense, that different generating units cannot have costs that differ, as counterintuitive as that sounds.  More efficient units will have lower fuel costs (for example), but higher opportunity costs for employment of the capital assets.  I would make this point in a report, simply to erode the credibility of the regulators, but I would not push it too hard, since some people cannot understand it.       6. The Report ignores the market power of the respective regulatory bodies as monopsonists under the implicit system of price controls and refunds.       7. The definition of ""market power"" is entirely obscure, except implicitly as bids higher than marginal cost as measured by the regulators.  This is incorrect, and I think that this needs to be explained clearly.         I am sure that other errors and omissions will emerge as the relevant documents and arguments are reviewed.  Anyway, I'd like to prepare such a report.  I would have to see precisely what it is that must be refuted, but my guess is that this is about a two-week project in terms of required analytic and writing time.  An effort to measure marginal cost correctly would be a good deal more involved and time-consuming, and my sense is that at this stage a refutation is more important.  If it is a two-week project, then I think that $15,000 would be reasonable.      Looking forward to hearing from you.

Not well drafted. It's also overly complicated and proscriptive.  Deletes the offensive part of ABX 1. It allows anybody to do whatever they want until June 1 (section 2 d) On June 1,   - res and small commercial customers can get in a cue and get DA up to the # of MWs that are added through load growth. (Section 2 e)   -- Larger customers would pay an exit fee. (section 2 f)   -- DA customers would be a entrance fee to return to IOU service (Section 2 g)  There is also a confusing section (2 c) that says a retail customer is only stuck with CDWR for the proportion of power that CDWR provides.  The way it reads, if CDWR is providing 40% of the IOUs' power, the retail customer can get DA for 60% of its load.  I doubt that will fly -- too difficult to keep track of and ISO will oppose (only one scheduling coordinator/meter)  A conference call and meeting is scheduled with parties tomorrow on this language.

The  state is not suffering from deregulation. Rather, it is afflicted by a  strange mutant ailment -- partial deregulation and now partial reregulation  -- that has produced a flawed market. California designed a market that  disconnected customers from prices and, at the same time, made it neither  profitable nor possible to build a new power plant. The result is a serious  power shortage. Instead of fixing these flaws, the current policies from Sacramento are  moving California down the road to an expensive public power setup and higher  prices for consumers and businesses. And the shortage is going to get worse  this summer. Under typical weather conditions, the state could face as much  as a 10 percent shortfall in electric power during summer peak demand, which  will mean severe emergency conditions and periods of blackouts. The effect is  likely to be a big shock not only to the economy of California and to the  rest of the interconnected West but also to the bruised national economy. Unlike other states that have successfully deregulated over the past few  years, California has made three crucial mistakes since the mid-1990s, when  restructuring of the power industry began. The first is the political unwillingness to allow consumers to see real price  signals. The so-called ""wholesale price"" -- what utilities pay to generating  companies -- has been decontrolled, but the price consumers pay to the  utilities has not. Consumer prices are remain at 1996 levels, and Gov. Gray  Davis has promised to hold to his pledge of no rate increase. Although the  price of natural gas, which is used to make a large and rapidly growing share  of electricity in California, has increased dramatically, consumers would not  know that from their bills. Nor would they know that rain and snowfall  levels, on which California critically depends for hydropower, are at low  levels. As a result, the utilities have been in the perverse position of  selling power to their customers at much lower rates than they are buying  power from generators. That is why the utilities are now $13 billion in the  hole and teetering on bankruptcy.  Instead of letting customers see higher prices that reflect the realities of  supply and demand -- and then act accordingly -- the state is going to use  their tax money to advertise conservation. But 25 years of experience  demonstrates that promoting conservation without price signals is not very  successful. Instead of paying through their bills, Californians will be  paying through their taxes for various measures that will enable politicians  to say that they prevented electric power rates from going up. As California drains electricity from its neighbors, residents of those  states are seeing their power bills go up by 30 percent or more. We calculate  that if rates in California rose by just 20 percent, a third of the shortage  could disappear in a matter of months. But instead, the state has embarked on  a course of passing higher costs along to consumers in neighboring states and  leaving the major bill to be paid by Californians themselves in decades to  come. The second mistake in California is a failure to charge customers for  ""capacity."" Electricity, unlike other commodities, cannot be stored. If there  is a shortage of telephone equipment, the result is a busy signal --  frustrating but survivable. But when it comes to electric power, the  equivalent of a busy signal is a blackout, and that is unacceptable. Thus, a  well-functioning power system needs to pay generators to maintain adequate  capacity. That includes a reserve of capacity about 15 percent above expected  demand to cope with the unexpected -- whether it's a heat wave, a sudden  surge in economic growth or breakdowns in aging power plants. In contrast to  other states, California's scheme did not provide any incentive for  generating companies to add new capacity and maintain that kind of reserve. The third mistake is the creation of monumental obstacles to siting and  granting permits to new facilities. California is one of the most difficult  places on earth to build a new power plant. The environmental permit process,  in contrast to other states, is complex, cumbersome and deeply discouraging  to would-be investors. Companies will spend three or four years to get  approval after approval -- and then find their proposal shot down by yet  another local group. As a result of all this, no major new plants have been built in the state in  the past 10 years. Meanwhile, the California economy grew 29 percent over the  past five years. In the same time, its electricity consumption increased by  24 percent. The result was inevitable -- a shortage.  California is on the verge of making three more mistakes in dealing with the  power crisis. First, the state is signing badly designed long-term contracts  for electricity in the midst of a shortage. California cannot simply finance  the crisis forever into the future. This summer is likely to generate  billions of dollars in additional uncollected wholesale power charges, which  now appear likely to be on the state's books, to be paid over an untold  number of years.  The second mistake is the plan for a state takeover of the transmission wires  to provide a multibillion-dollar cash infusion into the state's three biggest  utilities in order to temporarily hold bankruptcy at bay. The prospect of the  state -- now the largest power purchaser in the market -- controlling the  physical infrastructure necessary for market interactions will have a  chilling effect on power investment. As a result, the state could well end up  having to assume the role of building new power plants in the future.  Third, a market breakdown this summer would add enormously to the pressure  for price caps on wholesale power. But even ""temporary"" price caps, because  of uncertainty over their duration and effect, would slow rather than  encourage new investment. Unfortunately, the state's current plans and  proposals divert attention from ways of fixing the problem and have  California on the path to an expensive and expansive public power authority. The priority need is, first, to move very quickly to increase supply and  reduce demand, and to do so now, while the coming big shock is still a few  months away.

This is my suggested approach, which is obviously subject to change per our discussion during the call tomorrow.  I would like to highlight that the draft characterizes the approach as a ""circuit breaker"" during periods of highest demand and suggests that this is distinct from notions of market power abuse.  Other entities are arguing that during the highest demand, when it exceeds available supplies, all suppliers have and are ""exercising"" (as distinct from abusing?) market power.  The draft attempts to highlight the current regional supply context characterized by the drought as a rationale for the ""emergency circuit breaker.""  As mentioned in Katie Kaplan's email this morning, if your company has a draft of comments, we would appreciate an opportunity to look at them to avoid substantive conflicts.  I trust this is the right distribution list but I was not able to use the list from this morning's email because of computer problems at my end.

You should return any comments, in a redlined format, directly to Ben, as he  will maintain document control of his paper.  Comments will be appreciated as  soon as possible, but no later than close of business tomorrow.   Meanwhile, I will be significantly redoing the draft filing sent out  yesterday.  It will highlight Ben's findings and attach his paper to our  filing, which will focus on policy and operational issues raised by the FERC  staff proposal.  It will go out later tonight and, as with Ben's paper,  comments will be required no later than close of business Wednesday.   In connection with that, I have redceived the draft Williams comments.  Any  other WPTF member who is planning to file should also send me as soon as  possible the latest version of your proposed comments, so that I can avoid  any inconsistent staments in the WPTF filing and support some of the  positions you are taking.

"CONFIDENTIAL  ATTY CLIENT WORK PRODUCT  Sue, Joe, Mary:  As you can see from my other email, I took a wack at supplementing the  EPSA/WPTF comments with some additional stuff on hyrdro.  I will try to get Tim Belden's read on whether my insert is important or not  to include but I would appreciate your feedback too.  Re: EPSA's draft: It is very good.  My only comment is that, beginnign on p.  3,  EPSA should more directly attack the concept of economic witholding.   There really is no such thing (or it really is not different that physical  witholding).  If you raise your price above the opportunity cost in the  market, your buyer will go to that other resource and thus you won't be able  to economically withold.  Re: WPTF, I am not sure what to say.  I apologize that I had not read  carefully before our 1 pm call but the version I reviewed has some issues. I  just don't think it will be received that well by the FERC staff. Other than  amplifying the credit issue (probably in there at Sue's request) I am hard  pressed to know why Enron would support it seperate from EPSA.

This is a= =20 power outage caused by politics in Sacramento under Gov. Gray Davis, rather= =20 than some unavoidable mismatch between supply and demand.  This is March. Peak demand is thousands upon thousands of megawatts lower= =20 than it will be this summer. And yet the lights are going out.  These rolling Gray-outs trace squarely back to state government's failure t= o=20 figure out a way to pay for all the power that California needs. The=20 generators who aren't getting paid are beginning to go temporarily out of= =20 business. Day by day, less and less power is available for the grid, to the= =20 point that a little bit of spring sun is enough to overtax supply and turn= =20 out the lights. Unbelievable.  It's true that the governor is bleeding the state's coffers to the tune of= =20 about $50 million every day to pay the big for-profit generators for their= =20 supply. This is his short-term solution, until the longer-term solution --= =20 whatever that is -- kicks in. But no, even that huge payment isn't all the= =20 money needed to pay all the generators.  Neglected by the government plan are about 600 little guys that produce 20= =20 percent of the electricity supply. These are generators dotted throughout t= he=20 state known as Qualifying Facilities. A creation of the alternative energy= =20 movement of the 1970s, these are plants powered by natural gas, the sun and= =20 the wind. Unlike the big for-profit generating companies, these QFs are=20 contractually tied to the giant utilities, Southern California Edison and= =20 PG&E. And the utilities haven't been paying them for weeks and weeks -- at= =20 this point the QFs are owed $1.48 billion.  Not surprisingly, some of these generators can't afford to keep producing= =20 power for free. Grid operators say that these QFs could be producing about= =20 6,000 megawatts if they were being paid. Instead, they are producing about= =20 3,100, and the amount is decreasing. Outages were triggered on Monday becau= se=20 the grid was short about 1,000 megawatts of load. This math clearly reveals= =20 how avoidable this disruption was. Call it a rolling Gray-out.  Bipartisan legislation has languished in Sacramento for weeks that would cu= t=20 in half what these QFs have been billing the utilities. The savings are=20 possible by moving these contracts into long-term deals and out of the=20 higher-priced spot market. This piece of the overall solution has been=20 stalled while the governor has been at work on the others, such as returnin= g=20 the big utilities to solvency and locking in power purchases long-term with= =20 the big for-profit generators. Disregarding the little guys, however, is a= =20 mistake that the governor and Legislature should correct immediately.

Connell also denied Gov. Gray Davis' request to transfer an additional $5.6  billion from the general fund to the Special Fund for Economic Uncertainties,  the release said.  Connell noted that, given the rapid depletion of the general fund on power  purchases, the state would need to borrow $2.4 billion in order to tranfer  the  $5.6 billion from the general fund to the special fund.  ""We started this year with a generous budget surplus. The energy crisis has  taken much of that away, and this transfer on top of the electricity  purchases  would put the fund at risk,"" Connell said.   Connell called on Davis to ensure that the CDWR completes by the end of May  2001  the revenue bond sales that will be used to buy power and repay the general  fund.  She also asked that the CDWR notify her of all power purchases made and  contracts negotiated thus far and requested that she be told within 7 days of  any purchases and contracts negotiated in the future.  Connell also said she wanted to be told within 24 hours of any power buys  that  exceed $55 million and asked that the Department of Finance be directed to  prepare new general fund cash flow estimates for the next 30 and 60 days, and  for the end of the fiscal year.  The state's Department of Water Resources has been buying power since January  in  lieu of Edison International (EIX) utility Southern California Edison and  PG&E  Corp (PCG) utility Pacific Gas and Electric Co, because suppliers refused to  sell to the nearly-bankrupt utilities.  -By Jessica Berthold; Dow Jones Newswires; 323-658-3872;  jessicaberthold@dowjones.com   Gov. Davis' office said, in response to Connell's comments, that the state  budget was solid and the economy remained strong.  ""We will be getting the money back we've paid for energy and it should have  no  significant effect on the state's finances from the Wall Street perspective,""  said Davis press secretary Steve Maviglio.  -By Jessica Berthold; Dow Jones Newswires; 323-658-3872;  jessicaberthold@dowjones.com      2001 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

"I submitted the following RCRs for CA: Intervention in Support of Strategic Energy Enron supported Strategic's complaint against the CA ISO, regarding its  request to require the ISO release OOM (out of market) data publicly. ENA  (Tim Belden) has always had as a number one priority, release more data  sooner, and this filing offered an opportunity promote that concept.  The  filing was made on 3/20/01.  Opposition to ISO Compliance Filing On Creditworthiness Standards The ISO made a compliance filing that greatly expands its creditworthiness  exemptions, far beyond what FERC had ordered in its 2/14/01 order.  The ISO's  tariff language can be read to allow the utilities to count the credit status  of third parties as their own, without the third parties' approvals.  Enron  will oppose.  The filing is due 3/22/01.  Also Bracewell is making or has made the following CA filings (these are all  I know about anyway):  Tucson Electric Complaint   Intervention -- vanilla 3/19   Done for Sanders  -- no RCR PNM Complaint   Support   3/22 Done for Sanders -- no RCR FERC Staff Report  Support EPSA/WPTF 3/22 Plan to do for <$500       and raise temporal issue of western resources City of San Diego  Intervene/comment 3/28 Probably will be done for Sanders  The underscheduling filing was put on hold.  We were mistaken when we thought  that comments on an ISO proposal were due 3/22.   Instead, we've now decided  to file comments in response to the ISO's filing of tariff changes, which  should be made soon.  That's all for the rest of March, so far.

"I exchanged v-mails with Elena Scmid at the ISO.  The leaked information  pertains to a filing to be made at FERC today that responds to the FERC  Staff's report on market mitigation.  The ISO had last week released its own  proposed market mitigation plan -- or, as they referred to it, the market  stabilization plan.  There was much negative response to it.  I spoke against  it at the Board meeting and submitted written comments in opposition.  The  Board blessed it ""in concept"" and agreed to the let the staff file it, but to  ask the staff for a few changes.  I would be surprised if much has changed  since we've seen it.  Along with the filing are two staff reports, one by  Angeli and one by Eric Hildebrandt that identifyy what they see as market  power.  According the Elena, she does not believe that the reports use the  term ""gouging."" These reports are just extenstions of what we've seen from  the ISO before.  Previously, the ISO talked about $650 million or so in  potential refunds.  These reports extend the time period of the analysis.   I've asked Elena to let me know if Enron is named and when it will be  posted.  Elena says that the ISO also asks for the mitigation period to be at  all times not just at 5% of the time as FERC has sugested.  It is not yet posted on the ISO web site.

"THE LA Times was wrong in its assertion that the ISO was asking for $5.5  billion in refunds.  The filing is submitting comments to FERC.   The ISO  said that the purpose of the filing is to ask FERC to be more aggressive in  their approach to market mitigation and provide context to FERC for its  decision.  The report the ISO staff has done covers the period from May 2000  to Feb 2001 and calculates that prices exceeded what they would expect in a  competitive market by $6.2 billion. The ISO states that it is not claiming  that these are overcharges. They understand that other factors are in play  and that the ISO does not  have access to the generator cost data -- so they  are unable to say how much of the dollars are overcharges.  ISO General Counsel said he can't tell how much is an overcharge, how much  should be refunded, how much might be unjust and unreasonable.  ISO is  working with other state agencies, AG, CPUC, EOB, and don't know if the  action should be taken at FERC, the courts, ...

"Lynch and Wood Running the meeting  Lynch started out castigating FERC for the ""failure to act"", sellers for high  prices forcing CA into this action.  Has some charts in the press package.   Talked about how wonderful the Govs proposals have been.  Said net short is  34%.  Sellers ""have us over a barrell"" for those sales.  Attorney Gen  continues investigation of the sellers. These are all for going forward costs  -- this doesn't address the ""$ for the hot dog, which is being taken care of  in Sacramento.""  She said these proposals ensure reliability and allow  Treasurer to issue bonds.  Continues to castigate FERC throughout the call.  Wants new appointments to FERC from the states -- ""our cries have fallen on  deaf ears""  Lynch announced the following votes for tomorrow:  1.  Wood's proposal -- modified -- Order the IOUs to pay the QFs beginning  4/1 on a going forward basis only.  Modified existing formula in Section 390  (Legislative change to this section did not pass yet).  Shifts the gas index  from Topoc (where Wood says the prices are being mnipulated) to Malin, where  prices have been more stable.  2. Sets the CA Procurement Adjustment -- Orders the IOUs to pay the DWR for  purchases.  At one point she said that the order would be for all power for  purchased by the state beginning Jan 19; at another point she said that the  payments are for going forward costs. ""It's time to pay the power bills for  California.""  CPA calculated based on the ""residual"" method, rather than the  proportional method.  Payments to DWR made on the proportional method,  however.  3.  Lynch alternate setting a 3 cents/kWh increase in accordance with AB 1X.  (The ALJ decision said no rate increase.) Makes the 1 cent temp charge  permanent (didn't say if its additive with the 3 cents) Believe this covers  ALL needs on a going forward basis.  According to  ABX 1, small customers  with 130% over baseline get no increase, small customers with 200% increase,  get a 9 % increase -- the rest get socked, I guess.  Adopted TURN's  accounting proposal.  Will look at rate design in a future proceeding.  Takes  IOUs 30-45 days to charge the rates; will conduct a rate design proceeding  during that time period (see # 5).  4. Orders an investigation into the Utility holding company structure to see  if it is best for the public utilities.  A new proceeding was also identified.  5.  Lynch is issuing an Assigned Comissioner ruling proposing a new rate  structure. (I presume to have rates that increase greatly with more use)   Need information from DWR to calculate rates and DWR has not yet provided  it.  Described the need to have a record on this.

When things settle down (will that ever happen?), maybe weekly calls won't be  necessary.  But given the pace and intensity of matters, we should try and  coordinate through a 30 minute call.  I suggest Friday afternoon (3pm  Houston) - that should give us the ability to make sure the right RCRs are  submitted for discussion Monday am.  Also, Sue Mara has been keeping a catalog of activities on Power Wholesale  matters.  (1) Sue can you please send it out to all of these people, (2) Sue.  should we let the DC team - Ray and Donna - keep the catalog to make sure  that we are organized before FERC?  Appreciate your thoughts.  Let me know.  I'll ask Marcia to try and put this together for this Friday  and going forward.

Preliminary analysis of State Windfall Profit Tax.  This will be discussed during the cc scheduled for 9:00 a.m. today, Wed.   -----Original Message----- From:    C. Stephen Davis [mailto:csdlaw@pacbell.net] Sent:   Wednesday, April 04, 2001 8:33 AM To:   Steven Kelly Cc:   Douglas K. Kerner Subject:   Proposed Windfall Profit Tax  Gentlemen:         I understand that the some of the Democratic leadership of the California Legislature is contemplating a charge against the electric-generating industry in retaliation for recent price increases. The charge is to be styled as a ""windfall profit tax"" modeled on President Carter's tax on oil company profits following deregulation of oil prices in 1980 (The Crude Oil Windfall Profit Tax Act of 1980, 26 USC 4986 et seq.). The Carter Windfall Profit Tax was levied on the difference between the current wellhead price of the oil and the sum of the adjusted base price set by Congress, multiplied by the applicable rate. I understand the California charge will similarly be calculated by reference to a 1999 base price and current prices, to which difference some sort of tax rate will be applied. You asked whether this approach to punishing electric wholesalers was infirm from either a policy or legal perspective. The basic policy problem is that the tax will discourage sales of electricity in California.  California will become the market of last resort.  Another problem is that the Tax might be seen as promoting a ""California First"" policy at the expense of other states. This is so because the Tax could well be included in the FERC rate base as  ""taxes other than income taxes,"" and thereby be shifted to other customers.         The Tax may suffer from legal flaws as well. The principal problem is preemption by The Federal Power Act. The states are prohibited from regulating wholesale power rates as a direct burden on interstate commerce. The proposed charge, whether called a ""windfall profit tax"" or an excise tax or a sales or use tax or something else, is underground rate making. There is little or no practical difference between a rate cap and a tax on all revenues measured with reference to a certain price point from the perspective of the interstate electric wholesaler. Thus, the burden on interstate commerce posed by direct rate regulation and taxing revenues using a price base is comparable.         The Tax may also constitute an unconstitutiional taking if the price allowed is less than the cost of production and a reasonable return. The proposed historical base price will not, for example, reflect recent fuel price increases.         Two other potential issues arise as well. First, the tax has many of the hallmarks of a use tax, i.e., the tax is levied on the purchase of goods from an out-of-state provider for delivery to and use in California. The gross receipts form the sale of electricity have been exempt from sales and use tax for more than 50 years. Rev. & Tax. Code Section 6353. While this statute could, presumably, be amended, doing so would be a major policy departure and a big step towards imposing sales tax on utility sales. A second concern is the possible impairment of existing contracts as a result of the Legislature's meddling in rate regulation.         I was unable to identify any instance in which a state imposed a windfall profit tax on electricity sales.         The forgoing is the product of my conversations last evening with Doug Kerner and a few hours of LEXIS research. The issues are complex and could not be much developed in the time available. This material is best viewed as informed ""issue spotting.""   Nevertheless, I feel strongly that the proposed ""Tax"" can fairly be characterized as rate making.   Very Truly Yours, C.

"Gov. Davis open to tax on electric generators' profits   Updated: April 4, 2001 - 5:52 p.m.   Gov. Gray Davis says he is open to supporting a windfall-profits tax being proposed by lawmakers on electric generators that have made a fortune selling power to California this year.   He also broke with his appointees on the Public Utilities Commission in saying private companies and other large users should be allowed to contract directly for power with generators.   . . . .   For the first time, Davis also said the state should let companies buy their power from generators instead of going through the utilities.   A January law that allowed the state to begin buying power for two nearly bankrupt utilities barred such side contracts.   ""That was done originally with the thought the state would have more power and no one to sell it to if companies got off the grid,"" Davis said. ""But our problem is the opposite this summer. If companies want to get off the grid, we should encourage, not discourage that.""   The Democratic governor's comments came after he met behind closed doors for more than two hours with Assembly Republicans, who have sharply criticized his handling of the energy crisis.   ""I think everyone agreed there are no political winners unless we resolve this challenge,"" Davis said. ""There were a lot of suggestions in there I'm willing to adopt.""   . . . .   Davis said he hasn't written the remarks he will make during a five-minute address at 6:05 p.m. Thursday that he has asked California television stations to carry live.   However, he said he will ""share with them (viewers) the progress that we've made and what we have to get through.""

As expected, the Senate Revenue and Tax Committe voted out SB1X, the Windfall Tax Bill (see attached bill language).  While the co-author noted it was a ""work in progress,"" he noted that he envisioned a program wherein 150% of the existing corporate rate would apply to the ""excess profits."" This approach would result in a tax rate of approximately 13.5 percent applied to the ""excess proftis.""  IEP testified against the bill (see attached IEP letter opposing the bill). In response to questions, the author indicated the intent was not to ""go after QFs"", but he also presumed that QFs were not receiving ""gross profits.""  Questions left unanswered included:  would the tax apply to municipal entities; how would the tax apply to out-of-state entities; what would be the impact on system sales and reliability;  what would be the impact on incentives for new development.  The bill is expected to move to the Senate Appropriations Committee. However, the Appropriations Committee is not expected to take the bill up this week, and the members apparently are still planning on taking a recess next week.  -----Original Message----- From: Carol Hudson [mailto:carol@iepa.com] Sent: Wednesday, April 04, 2001 4:44 PM To: Steven Kelly (E-mail) Subject: FW: windfall profits tax lang.          - windfall profits tax bill    4-04-01.doc  - Senate Bill 1.rtf","alan.comnes@enron.com, angela.schwarz@enron.com, beverly.aden@enron.com,   bill.votaw@enron.com, brenda.barreda@enron.com,   carol.moffett@enron.com, cathy.corbin@enron.com,   chris.foster@enron.com, christina.liscano@enron.com,   christopher.calger@enron.com, craig.sutter@enron.com,   dan.leff@enron.com, debora.whitehead@enron.com,   dennis.benevides@enron.com, don.black@enron.com,   douglas.huth@enron.com, edward.sacks@enron.com,   eric.melvin@enron.com, erika.dupre@enron.com, evan.hughes@enron.com,   fran.deltoro@enron.com, gayle.muench@enron.com,   ginger.dernehl@enron.com, gordon.savage@enron.com,   harold.buchanan@enron.com, harry.kingerski@enron.com,   iris.waser@enron.com, james.steffes@enron.com, james.lewis@enron.com,   james.wright@enron.com, jeff.messina@enron.com,   jeremy.blachman@enron.com, jess.hewitt@enron.com,   joe.hartsoe@enron.com, karen.denne@enron.com, kathy.bass@enron.com,   kathy.dodgen@enron.com, ken.gustafson@enron.com,   kevin.hughes@enron.com, leasa.lopez@enron.com,   leticia.botello@enron.com, mark.muller@enron.com,   marsha.suggs@enron.com, marty.sunde@enron.com,   meredith.eggleston@enron.com, michael.etringer@enron.com,   michael.mann@enron.com, michelle.cisneros@enron.com,   mpalmer@enron.com, neil.bresnan@enron.com, neil.hong@enron.com,   paul.kaufman@enron.com, richard.zdunkewicz@enron.com,   richard.leibert@enron.com, richard.shapiro@enron.com,   rita.hennessy@enron.com, robert.badeer@enron.com,   rosalinda.tijerina@enron.com, sandra.mccubbin@enron.com,   sarah.novosel@enron.com, scott.gahn@enron.com,   scott.stoness@enron.com, sharon.dick@enron.com, skean@enron.com,   susan.mara@enron.com, tanya.leslie@enron.com, tasha.lair@enron.com,   ted.murphy@enron.com, terri.greenlee@enron.com, tim.belden@enron.com,   tony.spruiell@enron.com, vicki.sharp@enron.com,   vladimir.gorny@enron.com, wanda.curry@enron.com,   william.bradford@enron.com, jubran.whalan@enron.com,   triley@enron.com, richard.sanders@enron.com,   robert.williams@enron.com, dwatkiss@bracepatt.com,   rcarroll@bracepatt.com, donna.fulton@enron.com, gfergus@brobeck.com,   bruno.gaillard@enron.com, linda.robertson@enron.com, ren@enron.com,   lazure@enron.com, michael.tribolet@enron.com,   phillip.allen@enron.com, christian.yoder@enron.com,   jklauber@llgm.com, tamara.johnson@enron.com, mary.hain@enron.com,   greg.wolfe@enron.com, jeff.dasovich@enron.com,   dirk.vanulden@enron.com, steve.walker@enron.com,   james.wright@enron.com, mike.smith@enron.com,   richard.shapiro@enron.com, leslie.lawner@enron.com,   robert.neustaedter@enron.com, steve.walton@enron.com,   psmith3@enron.com, mjackso7@enron.com, janel.guerrero@enron.com,   mark.fillinger@enron.com, jennifer.rudolph@enron.com,   martin.wenzel@enron.com, wgang@enron.com, joseph.alamo@enron.com,   tracy.ngo@enron.com, ray.alvarez@enron.com, steve.hall@enron.com,   david.leboe@enron.com, jay.zoellner@enron.com,   fatimata.liamidi@enron.com, sonia.perez@enron.com",susan.mara@enron.com,Update on Senate Windfall Profits tax lang. -- from IEP,2001-04-05 03:38:00-07:00,sent

To the extent (and only to the extent) that a purchase is not otherwise paid by any party or payable by another party meeting the credit standards set forth in the ISO Tariff (another ""Qualified Party""), DWR will assume financial responsibility for all purchases by the ISO in its ancillary services and imbalance energy markets based on bids or other offers determined to be reasonable. Such determination of reasonableness will be made by DWR on a case by case basis and communicated to the ISO.  All bids into the ancillary services and imbalance energy markets will be deemed to be contingent on the acceptance of financial responsibility by DWR, to the extent not paid or payable by another Qualified Party.  Unless a supplier is otherwise notified, any bid accepted by the ISO will be deemed to have the financial support of another Qualified Party or DWR as specified in this notice.  In addition to the foregoing, DWR will assume financial responsibility for all purchases resulting from the issuance by the ISO of emergency dispatch instructions, to the extent not paid or payable by another Qualified Party.  Payment for such purchases shall be made according to the rate specified in the ISO Tariff for emergency dispatch instructions.  The ISO and/or DWR reserve the right to rescind or modify the foregoing arrangements at any time and for any reason, including a successful rehearing or appeal from the April 6 order.  As the FERC determined in its February 14 order that DWR is a creditworthy counterparty, the ISO believes that the foregoing arrangements meet the requirements of FERC's April 6 Order. Accordingly, the ISO expects that suppliers will honor their obligations under the ISO Tariff and related agreements to respond to ISO dispatch instructions.

Andrea Weller  Market Strategist  Strategic Energy, LLC  949.230.3404  aweller@sel.com       SENATORS CALL FOR INVESTIGATION INTO EFFECTIVENESS OF FEDERAL ENERGY  REGULATION       Senators Joe Lieberman, D-Conn., and Jean Carnahan, D-Mo., have asked the  General Accounting Office (GAO) to inquire into whether the Federal Energy  Regulatory Commission (FERC) is carrying out its responsibilities to ensure  that wholesale electricity sales throughout the country are reasonable and  that interstate natural gas pipelines are fulfilling their obligations to  customers. ""Under federal law, FERC has the responsibility to ensure just and  reasonable prices for interstate wholesale transmission,"" the Senators said  in a letter to GAO, ""but there is mounting evidence that FERC may not have  fulfilled this role in the California situation."" Following is text of the  letter:   April 12, 2001   Mr. David M. Walker  Comptroller General of the United States  U.S. General Accounting Office  441 G Street, N.W.  Washington, D.C. 20548   Dear Mr. Walker:   We have been watching with dismay as the state of California suffers sporadic  rolling blackouts with impacts on electricity supplies and prices throughout  the western United States, a situation that may get worse this summer when  the demand for electricity increases. We understand that there are many  factors that have contributed to the current situation, and few short term  options to create more electricity for this market. At the same time we are  extremely troubled that California's Independent System Operator (ISO)  recently asserted that suppliers of electricity in California have allegedly  been charging many times more than what it actually costs to generate the  electricity, an overcharge amounting to $6.8 billion according to the  operator. Some experts believe that these high prices reflect a  non-functioning market that has, in turn, exacerbated the state's electricity  shortage.With the possibility of electricity deregulation occurring soon in  additional states such as Missouri, we are concerned whether there is  adequate federal oversight to guard against potential abuse of market power  by suppliers. Without such oversight, the nation may not progress towards  achieving what many see as the promise of deregulation: lower consumer  prices, greater reliability, increased choice, and more efficient generation.  Deregulation legislation being considered in Missouri would transfer the  oversight authority from the Missouri Public Service Commission (PSC), which  works closely with the utilities to provide direction if there are capacity  or reliability concerns and sets appropriate customer rates, to the Federal  Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). Under federal law, FERC has the  responsibility to ensure just and reasonable prices for interstate wholesale  transmission, but there is mounting evidence that FERC may not have fulfilled  this role in the California situation. FERC Commissioner William Massey  recently said: ""Ensuring just and reasonable prices in wholesale markets  requires that we clearly define market power, and aggressively intervene when  the markets are not producing reasonable prices. The commission's actions to  date have been insufficient."" (March 20, 2001 testimony to the House Energy  Committee's Subcommittee on Energy and Air quality).We are requesting that  the General Accounting Office (GAO) assess whether FERC is properly  exercising its role to enforce reasonable electricity rates. Specifically, we  ask GAO to answer the following questions:   1) Has FERC fulfilled its mandate to ensure just and reasonable rates? Is  FERC adequately monitoring and appropriately regulating based on its statutes  power supply, demand, and pricing in California? In other Western states? In  the Central Midwest and in the Northeast?   2) Has FERC devoted sufficient resources to carry out its oversight  obligations in a timely and effective manner? And does FERC have the  necessary resources to carry out its future oversight role?   3) Does FERC need additional authority to carry out its mission of ensuring  just and reasonable prices given that widespread partial deregulation is now  occurring in so many states?   4) As we understand the situation from some experts, the number of  transactions in electricity that occur in the deregulated wholesale market  place is voluminous. This situation may increase the difficulties of guarding  against market abuse. Is there a role for another agency or independent  organization to exercise an oversight role with respect to these  transactions? If so, what would be an appropriate oversight role?   5) We have been advised by some experts that greater transparency of prices  relating to the buying and selling of electricity in a deregulated market  would help guard against market abuses. We understand the need to keep prices  confidential for a period of time to ensure against collusion. After this  appropriate period of time has passed, would greater transparency be  beneficial?   We are also concerned about recent allegations by the California Public  Utility Commission (CPUC) that market power has been abused in the  transmission of natural gas, which has in turn contributed to the spiraling  cost of electricity generation in the state. The CPUC maintains that the  price of natural gas transmitted by the El Paso pipeline has been manipulated  so that prices in California over the last year have been up to five times  the national average. Because an increasing number of states, including  California, rely heavily on natural gas fired power plants, any manipulation  of that commodity can have severe consequences. Additionally, because such a  large percent of our future nationwide generation capacity will use natural  gas, we are concerned that these types of alleged market abuses will have  even more profound effects. Therefore, we ask GAO to answer the following  questions:   1) Has FERC fully met its responsibilities to adequately regulate interstate  pipelines? If not, what areas require improvement?   2) Is there a continuing role for FERC to play in ensuring equal access to  the limited amount of space in our current natural gas pipelines?

(CARE)  v. BC Hydro, et al.,  EL01-65 Mime-Version: 1.0 Content-Type: multipart/mixed; boundary=""=_5D06B43C.1A7B1DE3""  FYI - Attached is a complaint filed by CARE on April 16 against BC Hydro,  Powerex, Mirant and BPA (with the LADWP thrown in as an unnamed respondent).   The complaint is principally directed against BC Hydro and Powerex.  It  essentially accuses BC Hydro and Powerex of manipulating the reservoirs in BC  and transmission capacity reserved by Powerex on the BPA system to COB and  NOB to withhold power during a period of peak demand ""to contrive a shortage  and test their market power.""  CARE accuses BC Hydro and Powerex of violating  Section 206 of the FPA, state and federal anti-trust laws, the civil rights  of Californians under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and NAFTA.  The complaint is long on sensational allegations and short on facts.  The  evidence proffered in the complaint consists of a rant off the YAHOO Message  Board by an unnamed power trader in Spokane (we think it is an Avista  trader), selected transmission data from the ISO, the LA Times article of  April 11, 2001 regarding the ISO's report on Powerex, BPA and LADWP, the ISO  report itself, and BC Hydro's residential rate schedule.  CARE requests FERC  to initiate an investigation, seeks unspecified refunds and punitive damages  and also appears to want FERC to have the Secretary of DOE declare an  emergency under Section 202(c) of the FPA and compel deliveries of  electricity.  FERC has noticed the complaint and has established May 8 as the due date for  interventions and responses.   - el01-65.tiff","alan.comnes@enron.com, angela.schwarz@enron.com, beverly.aden@enron.com,   bill.votaw@enron.com, brenda.barreda@enron.com,   carol.moffett@enron.com, cathy.corbin@enron.com,   chris.foster@enron.com, christina.liscano@enron.com,   christopher.calger@enron.com, craig.sutter@enron.com,   dan.leff@enron.com, debora.whitehead@enron.com,   dennis.benevides@enron.com, don.black@enron.com,   douglas.huth@enron.com, edward.sacks@enron.com,   eric.melvin@enron.com, erika.dupre@enron.com, evan.hughes@enron.com,   fran.deltoro@enron.com, gayle.muench@enron.com,   ginger.dernehl@enron.com, gordon.savage@enron.com,   harold.buchanan@enron.com, harry.kingerski@enron.com,   iris.waser@enron.com, james.steffes@enron.com, james.lewis@enron.com,   james.wright@enron.com, jeff.messina@enron.com,   jeremy.blachman@enron.com, jess.hewitt@enron.com,   joe.hartsoe@enron.com, karen.denne@enron.com, kathy.bass@enron.com,   kathy.dodgen@enron.com, ken.gustafson@enron.com,   kevin.hughes@enron.com, leasa.lopez@enron.com,   leticia.botello@enron.com, mark.muller@enron.com,   marsha.suggs@enron.com, marty.sunde@enron.com,   meredith.eggleston@enron.com, michael.etringer@enron.com,   michael.mann@enron.com, michelle.cisneros@enron.com,   mpalmer@enron.com, neil.bresnan@enron.com, neil.hong@enron.com,   paul.kaufman@enron.com, richard.zdunkewicz@enron.com,   richard.leibert@enron.com, richard.shapiro@enron.com,   rita.hennessy@enron.com, robert.badeer@enron.com,   rosalinda.tijerina@enron.com, sandra.mccubbin@enron.com,   sarah.novosel@enron.com, scott.gahn@enron.com,   scott.stoness@enron.com, sharon.dick@enron.com, skean@enron.com,   susan.mara@enron.com, tanya.leslie@enron.com, tasha.lair@enron.com,   ted.murphy@enron.com, terri.greenlee@enron.com, tim.belden@enron.com,   tony.spruiell@enron.com, vicki.sharp@enron.com,   vladimir.gorny@enron.com, wanda.curry@enron.com,   william.bradford@enron.com, jubran.whalan@enron.com,   triley@enron.com, richard.sanders@enron.com,   robert.williams@enron.com, dwatkiss@bracepatt.com,   rcarroll@bracepatt.com, donna.fulton@enron.com, gfergus@brobeck.com,   bruno.gaillard@enron.com, linda.robertson@enron.com, ren@enron.com,   lazure@enron.com, michael.tribolet@enron.com,   phillip.allen@enron.com, christian.yoder@enron.com,   jklauber@llgm.com, tamara.johnson@enron.com, mary.hain@enron.com,   greg.wolfe@enron.com, jeff.dasovich@enron.com,   dirk.vanulden@enron.com, steve.walker@enron.com,   james.wright@enron.com, mike.smith@enron.com,   richard.shapiro@enron.com, leslie.lawner@enron.com,   robert.neustaedter@enron.com, steve.walton@enron.com,   psmith3@enron.com, mjackso7@enron.com, janel.guerrero@enron.com,   mark.fillinger@enron.com, jennifer.rudolph@enron.com,   martin.wenzel@enron.com, wgang@enron.com, joseph.alamo@enron.com,   tracy.ngo@enron.com, ray.alvarez@enron.com, steve.hall@enron.com,   david.leboe@enron.com, jay.zoellner@enron.com,   fatimata.liamidi@enron.com, sonia.perez@enron.com",susan.mara@enron.com,"Fwd: Californians for Renewable Energy, Inc.

""There must be a short-circuit here because Reliant is claiming cooperation  with our investigation while refusing to turn over documents,"" Lockyer said.  The Attorney General asked the San Francisco Superior Court to order Reliant  and Mirant to produce subpoenaed documents that were due March 19. The  Attorney General told the court that both power companies have failed to  furnish documents despite being given assurances on the confidentiality of  their sensitive and proprietary information.   ""Reliant's sole basis for refusing to produce confidential information is its  claim that the Attorney General may not share such information with other  governmental agencies that the Attorney General may enlist to aid him in his  investigation,"" the Attorney General stated in the complaint. ""The argument  simply lacks merit.""  ""Reliant has sufficient guarantees regarding the confidentiality of its  information,"" the complaint said.  ""The Attorney General has stated that he  will not share confidential data with governmental agencies which have acted  as Reliant's competitors in the market or agencies with whom Reliant is  negotiating energy contracts. Disclosure of confidential information by any  subordinate officer is a misdemeanor and punishable by that officer being  disqualified from acting in any official capacity in the department. Any  government agency receiving information from the Attorney General to aid him  in his investigation would be bound by the same requirement.""  Similar arguments were made in seeking subpoenaed documents from power  company Mirant.                                                                                       # # #   ","alan.comnes@enron.com, angela.schwarz@enron.com, beverly.aden@enron.com,   bill.votaw@enron.com, brenda.barreda@enron.com,   carol.moffett@enron.com, cathy.corbin@enron.com,   chris.foster@enron.com, christina.liscano@enron.com,   christopher.calger@enron.com, craig.sutter@enron.com,   dan.leff@enron.com, debora.whitehead@enron.com,   dennis.benevides@enron.com, don.black@enron.com,   douglas.huth@enron.com, edward.sacks@enron.com,   eric.melvin@enron.com, erika.dupre@enron.com, evan.hughes@enron.com,   fran.deltoro@enron.com, gayle.muench@enron.com,   ginger.dernehl@enron.com, gordon.savage@enron.com,   harold.buchanan@enron.com, harry.kingerski@enron.com,   iris.waser@enron.com, james.steffes@enron.com, james.lewis@enron.com,   james.wright@enron.com, jeff.messina@enron.com,   jeremy.blachman@enron.com, jess.hewitt@enron.com,   joe.hartsoe@enron.com, karen.denne@enron.com, kathy.bass@enron.com,   kathy.dodgen@enron.com, ken.gustafson@enron.com,   kevin.hughes@enron.com, leasa.lopez@enron.com,   leticia.botello@enron.com, mark.muller@enron.com,   marsha.suggs@enron.com, marty.sunde@enron.com,   meredith.eggleston@enron.com, michael.etringer@enron.com,   michael.mann@enron.com, michelle.cisneros@enron.com,   mpalmer@enron.com, neil.bresnan@enron.com, neil.hong@enron.com,   paul.kaufman@enron.com, richard.zdunkewicz@enron.com,   richard.leibert@enron.com, richard.shapiro@enron.com,   rita.hennessy@enron.com, robert.badeer@enron.com,   rosalinda.tijerina@enron.com, sandra.mccubbin@enron.com,   sarah.novosel@enron.com, scott.gahn@enron.com,   scott.stoness@enron.com, sharon.dick@enron.com, skean@enron.com,   susan.mara@enron.com, tanya.leslie@enron.com, tasha.lair@enron.com,   ted.murphy@enron.com, terri.greenlee@enron.com, tim.belden@enron.com,   tony.spruiell@enron.com, vicki.sharp@enron.com,   vladimir.gorny@enron.com, wanda.curry@enron.com,   william.bradford@enron.com, jubran.whalan@enron.com,   triley@enron.com, richard.sanders@enron.com,   robert.williams@enron.com, dwatkiss@bracepatt.com,   rcarroll@bracepatt.com, donna.fulton@enron.com, gfergus@brobeck.com,   bruno.gaillard@enron.com, linda.robertson@enron.com, ren@enron.com,   lazure@enron.com, michael.tribolet@enron.com,   phillip.allen@enron.com, christian.yoder@enron.com,   jklauber@llgm.com, tamara.johnson@enron.com, mary.hain@enron.com,   greg.wolfe@enron.com, jeff.dasovich@enron.com,   dirk.vanulden@enron.com, steve.walker@enron.com,   james.wright@enron.com, mike.smith@enron.com,   richard.shapiro@enron.com, leslie.lawner@enron.com,   robert.neustaedter@enron.com, steve.walton@enron.com,   psmith3@enron.com, mjackso7@enron.com, janel.guerrero@enron.com,   mark.fillinger@enron.com, jennifer.rudolph@enron.com,   martin.wenzel@enron.com, wgang@enron.com, joseph.alamo@enron.com,   tracy.ngo@enron.com, ray.alvarez@enron.com, steve.hall@enron.com,   david.leboe@enron.com, jay.zoellner@enron.com,   fatimata.liamidi@enron.com, sonia.perez@enron.com",susan.mara@enron.com,"ATTORNEY GENERAL DEMANDS RELIANTAND MIRANT ENERGY RECORDS FOR PROBE  OF POSSIBLE PRICE-GOUGING, ANTI-COMPETITIVE BEHAVIOR AFFECTING ELECTRICITY  PRICES",2001-04-20 01:51:00-07:00,sent

Changing to  procured energy is inconsistent with the law AB1890 which requires DA  customers to be indifferent to buying from DA suppliers.   And since DA suppliers face costs close to DJ-NP15/SP15, that is the only  appropriate available method.    Further, the issue of how to calculate Px is interrelated to whether DA  customers should be charged the generation surcharges ($10 +$30).  DA  customers should be given market based Px credits (based on DJNP15/SP15)  because its the law.  There are 2 possible interpretations resulting from the  combination of AB1890 and the new law.   The DA customers should get a market based Px credit and not pay any  surcharge. The DA customers should get a market based Px credit and pay the $30 + $10  surcharges Interpretation 1 results in DA customers getting lower rates than all other  customers.  It seems unlikely that the legislation would have this intent. Interpretation 2 results in DA customers getting the same rate as all other  customers until the end of AB1890.  This seems like the likely interpretation  since otherwise the new legislation would have repealled AB1890.  Thus given  that the DA customers are being held indifferent to frozen rates plus $40,  they should get a Px market based credit plus pay the surcharge until the  rate freeze ends.  Once the Px credit ends (Mar 2002), the surcharge should end because the law  (AB1890) no longer requires them to be held at frozen rates and because: Any customer that is being served by a supplier other than DWR and the  utility is not causing any costs for DWR or the utility therefore they should  not be charged for them.  In the event that Px credit is not set based on market value (if the courts  interpret the law differently than Enron) then there should be no generation  surcharge for DA customers.

As part of the filing, SCE proposes to set ""on an interim basis"" the cost of energy procurement, for bundled service customers for billing purposes and in the calculation of the energy credit for direct access customers equal to the Generation rate component of the Customer's otherwise applicable tariff.  Two primary issues arise from SCE's statement. First what does ""interim basis"" mean -- how long will this be in effect.  In starts on January 19th, but it is unclear as to when it would end. Second, and most important. is what is meant by the Generation rate component.  While there is not much explanation in the April 5 advice letter, in a subsequent advice letter filed on April 11 (1533-E), SCE set forth ""Rate Schedule Specific Generation Related Rates"" which range between five and nine cents.  I have forwarded both the referenced advice letters to you earlier.  We need to protest the change in the PX credit by Wednesday, April 25th.  All thoughts on the matter are welcome.

WPTF warned the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) that the CAISO  proposal will have an extremely detrimental impact on power markets in  California as well as other electricity markets throughout the Western  Region.  ""Their plan imposes price caps and curtailment of power exports,""  said Gary Ackerman, executive director of the group.  If approved, the CAISO  plan, called the Market Stabilization Plan, will create disincentives for the  development of additional generation capacity, precisely the wrong signal  that needs to be sent at this time.  As a result, in addition to leading to  higher costs, the Plan will impair reliability in California and throughout  the West.  WPTF found that the CAISO's proposal to curtail exports is  particularly troublesome and potentially interferes with interstate commerce  in violation of the Federal Power Act (""FPA"").  ""This plan is yet another attempt to heap more rules on an already overruled  market.  This is the kind of misguided thinking that got California into its  current mess.  Their plan is too complex, academic, and does absolutely  nothing to address the real issues of low supply and high demand.  Consequently, the plan will have exactly the opposite effect,"" Ackerman  commented.  The WPTF supports the FERC's pro-competitive policies under Order No. 2000  for regional approaches to interstate electricity markets.  The membership of WPTF includes power marketers, scheduling coordinators,  power exchanges, generators and other active participants in the restructured  California electric market.  The members share a common mission of enhancing  competition in electric markets. WPTF actions are focused on supporting the  development of competitive electricity markets throughout the region and  developing uniform operating rules to facilitate transactions among market  participants.

The premise is obviously  preaching to the choir, and we (as I am sure others do as well) have a string  of proposals starting with SDGEs in May or June that, if we melded their  timing and their prices into the attached timeline would be very damaging to  thinking people.  However, are people really thinking, or has Davis and the  reporters tainted the waters too badly?  What would be the result that we  would like to get from such an exposee?  Do we really think that we could get  some sympathy for returning to a market based structure?  Or, would we be  like the irritating kid who keeps saying ""I told you so"", so it does not  matter if he was right or not?  Are there any legal issues in revealing the  prices?  Does doing this through IEP help?  (Note that the addition of prices  could not be done, I do not think,  without naming companies, so we would be  there, partially revealed.)  My vote:  if it does not hurt us (competitively, PR, etc.), if it is legal,  and especially if it can help make even a small amout of progress towards a  market based structure, I would do it.  Of course, we could not go anymore to  restaurants near the CPUC......  I am out of town for the rest of the week, so I will leave the decision to  you guys.  Whatever you decide, is OK.  PS - At the very least, we should feed our own proposals and their prices  into this timeline.  Privately, we could show it to various parties on a case  by case basis to advance our cause.

Senator Soto said that the Legislature must make a ""bold proposition"" with  this bill.  She said that this experience is ""like no consumer has been  gouged before.""  The Legislature must cap rates.  This bill guarantees a  generous profit to generators. Senator Scott said that these generator profits have been gained off of  consumers.  According to FERC, over $500 million in excess profits have been  reaped.  Californians have been ""royally mistreated"" by generators.  This  ""money has left the state (to Texas and other places).""  This bill is the  only solution.  The PUC can change the $80 rate.  Based upon the January  Field Poll, Californians support this concept.  We have to ""stand up to the  generators and say no more."" Supporters were:  TURN and CTRA (Lenny Goldberg).  Lenny said that the FERC  will not give any relief to CA ratepayers, so the Legislature has to.  This  bill needs to be combined with the power authority by Senator Burton to hold  prices down. Other supporters of the bill included:  Congress of CA Seniors; CalPIRG; CA  Consumer Federation; CA Labor Federation; SEIU; Public Power Now.  SEIU  (public employee union) said that this bill is ""the only way to put caps on  rates."" Opponents were CMTA (""this is the wrong medicine for solving the problem"");  WSPA (does nothing to resolve the shortage of energy; we should be doing  bills to stimulate greater investment in supply); Intergen said that they are  looking at California market, but will not build with this bill out there.   CA Wind Energy Assn (QFs oppose this bill because the rate is too low); and  IEP (most productive answer to our problem is the build power plants). Senator Battin said that the price cap is lower than some of the Governor's  long-term contracts at $86 per hour.  Senator Scott said that the munis are,  indeed, covered by the bill.  He also said that the PUC can change the rates  contained in this bill.  Scott also said that the PUC can exempt renewables  under the bill. Senator Bowen stated that the $80 figure should be removed from the bill  (""this price may be inappropriate"").  She suggested using the ""FERC proxy  price.""  She suggested that they look at an exemption for contracts with the  state.  She saw no reason to exempt the renewables because they would make a  bundle with an $80 cap. Senator Poochigian said he was concerned about the majority vote issue  (because this bill is allegedly revenue neutral).  Scott said all of the  money raised by the bill will go to ratepayers.  He said that Legislative  Counsel gave him an opinion (I don't know if it is written or verbal) that  this scheme was permitted.  Poochigian said it was ironic that the PUC was  being given the authority to set rates under this bill. Senator Scott stated that they would take as an author's amendment to exclude  all long-term contracts from the provisions of this bill. Next stop for the bill is the Senate Floor.

Gray Davis a deal that it hopes will solve its legal problems while helping to calm the state's chaotic electricity markets.   The proposed settlement, outlined in documents prepared in March by Duke's lawyers, calls for an end to various state investigations, private lawsuits and state complaints to federal authorities accusing Duke of overcharging.   In return, Duke would make an unspecified ""appropriate payment"" but admit no wrongdoing.   ""Duke is committed to sharing pain"" and ""expediting high-level confidential discussions that would embrace the governor's political and public relations needs,"" according to the documents, which were given to The New York Times by someone who wanted the issue aired publicly.   Governor Davis acknowledged the secret discussions in an interview in San Francisco yesterday, and said he hoped to meet with more generators soon. But he insisted that none of the companies would escape a substantial payment because, he said, they have penalized the state with excessive prices.   ""My general approach to the energy companies is that you have already charged the utilities a 50 percent credit penalty for the power they were buying from you,"" Mr. Davis said, so ""you're going to have to have a very substantial reduction"" in what the companies are owed.   Mr. Davis said Duke had walked in with ""a number of demands,"" including an end to state inquiries but that that was not likely to happen.   ""We're not about to call off the dogs,"" said the governor, a Democrat who will seek re-election next year.   Duke, based in Charlotte, N.C., is a major investor in California's wholesale electricity market, having spent more than $1 billion since the state opened its generating plants to outside operators in 1996.   It is also near the top of the list of companies accused of overcharging. Duke has been ordered by federal regulators to justify or refund $20 million in disputed charges this year, an amount that is third-highest among federally regulated companies in the California market.   By entering secret negotiations with Mr. Davis and being the first generator to settle, Duke could gain a public-relations advantage, in much the same way that the Liggett Group donned a white hat by being the first company to open talks with the state governments in the tobacco-litigation wars.   ""We've just simply tried to be part of the solution,"" Richard B. Priory, Duke's chairman and chief executive, said in an interview, adding that the company was ""offering ideas"" and ""throwing in suggestions.""   Publicly, Mr. Davis has disparaged out-of-state electricity generators before and after he began talking with them privately. In an interview two weeks ago with The Los Angeles Times, he called the generators ""the biggest snakes on the planet Earth"" for their pricing practices.   California's electricity costs have risen to about $28 billion last year from $7 billion in 1999. By some estimates, they could approach $70 billion this year =01* $2,000 for every resident. The state has stepped in to buy power for financially crippled utilities, including Pacific Gas and Electric, which is now in bankruptcy court.=20   The Davis administration has struck power deals with companies like Duke in hopes of securing a stable and affordable source of power. To pay those bills, Mr. Davis is seeking the largest municipal bond issue in American history, $12 billion, although some state officials privately estimate that the final amount will be higher.   The governor hopes the bond issue will eventually take the state's taxpayers off the hook. But how those costs are allocated among ratepayers, utilities and generators, and whether the bond issue can even succeed, remain unanswered questions. A major impediment to resolving the electricity crisis, according to state officials, utility executives and economists, is the secrecy surrounding the administration's negotiations.   Several Republicans have sued the Davis administration to learn the terms of specific contracts entered into by the state. On Monday, the administration released a 67-page financial analysis, including its most detailed disclosure about the overall costs of state electricity contracts. Last week Republicans blocked legislation that Mr. Davis says he needs to pass the bond issue. The bill could come up for a vote later this week.   ""The thing that has hindered Governor Davis the most among the legislative ranks is the demand for secrecy over the negotiations and the agreements that have been reached,"" said Senator Joseph L. Dunn, a Democrat from Santa Ana and the chairman of a select committee investigating the price spikes.   Mr. Davis, in the interview, said there were legitimate commercial reasons for keeping contract terms confidential.   The political uncertainty has spilled over into the markets, where the bonds would have to be sold. The state's credit rating, while still solid, is slipping.   Already companies that do business with California, like Duke, are citing the state's creditworthiness as a reason for charging higher prices in their dealing with the state, though the state has stepped in as buyer since February.   The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission recently ordered generators to justify high prices in California this year or pay $125 million in refunds. The companies =01* including Duke, Reliant Energy, Dynegy Inc. and the Williams Company =01* deny any wrongdoing and cite the state's credit situation as one reason for the high prices.   Mr. Priory, the Duke chairman, said that resolution of credit issues would lead his company to drop the so-called ""credit premium"" it now charges on power sales. As of March 7, Duke was owed more than $100 million by the state's power managers, documents show.   In its confidential submission to Mr. Davis and his aides, Duke said it would ""forgive an appropriate amount of certain receivables, or make an appropriate payment based upon a methodology that fairly represents its share of alleged overcharges.""=20   The documents do not give an amount, but Duke's 2000 annual report shows that its wholesale energy division had written off $110 million for power sales to California that had not been collected. (Even with that write-off, the unit's profits before taxes doubled from 1999 to 2000, and quadrupled for the first quarter of this year.)   Duke's ""preliminary global settlement template"" of March 9 goes on: ""Duke is committed to sharing pain with state and others on a fair and equitable basis, without admitting legal liability, because Duke has done nothing illegal.""   Duke says that much of its California power was sold last year on the forward markets, not the more volatile and higher-priced spot markets. But Mr. Priory also noted in his interview that at least 10 percent was sold for ""whatever the market price is.""   On March 23, Duke's lawyer, at the request of Mr. Davis's legal affairs secretary, forwarded to the governor's office additional information about pending litigation involving Duke and its power sales in California. The documents show that a top Duke priority is the ""prompt suspension of state investigations, lowering of rhetoric and stay of state litigation,"" as well as the withdrawal of state-related claims at the federal energy commission.   Also in March, the operators of the state's power grid told the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission that wholesale electricity prices in California were more than $6 billion above competitive prices over the previous 10 months. Duke has questioned the methodology of that submission and wants the claim withdrawn.   The inquiries of concern to Duke include those being conducted by the office of the attorney general, William Lockyer, and the California Public Utilities Commission.=20   Barry P. Goode, the governor's legal affairs secretary, says he subsequently referred Duke's lawyer to the attorney general's office. The two state agencies say that their inquiries are continuing. Sandra Michioku, a spokeswoman for Mr. Lockyer, said, ""Our investigation is ongoing.""   Loretta Lynch, the president of the utility commission, said in a telephone interview yesterday, ""The public utilities commission has not been involved in any settlement discussions with generators and our investigations into overcharges and withholding are ongoing and strong.""   The Duke documents say the company should be given preferential treatment for its conciliatory stance.   Other generators said they were not involved in settlement discussions with Mr. Davis.=20  http://www.nytimes.com/2001/05/02/national/02DAVI.html?ex=3D989822260&ei=3D= 1&en=3D70 3c8bd8125d53df  /-----------------------------------------------------------------\   Visit NYTimes.com for complete access to the most authoritative news coverage on the Web, updated throughout the day.

Several print journalists and 3 TV cameras were present at the  conference.  Also of interest is that the Senate tax consultants and Burton's  staff were at the event.  Assemblywoman Hannah-Beth Jackson showed up late  and gave a few quotes to the media present.  A spokesman from Mirant also  gave a few interviews after the press conference. According to Corbett's staff, they expect to handout the bill amendments at  the hearing. Among Corbett's comments to the media present: ""This bill is not a negotiating tool.  I'm very serious about this bill.  I  want to see it through the process.  The Governor will sign a bill like this."" The following amendments are to be presented at the committee hearing today as follows: AB 128X 1) Creates a Tax on Excess Gross Receipts from Electrical Energy Distribution (called a ""tax on excess greed"") 2) Imposes a tax on the first sale of electricity by generators and middlemen. 3) Establishes as the measure for the tax, the amount by which the gross receipts exceed a specified price (""the base price"").  The measure of tax is called the excess gross receipts. 4) Creates a 3-tier system of rates as follows: a) Sales price more than the base price but not more than 150% of the base price, tax rate = 50% b) Sales price more than 150% of the base price but not more than 200% of the base price, tax rate = 70%  c) Sales price more than 200% of the base price, tax rate = 90% 5) Creates a rebuttable presumption that the base price represents a fair sales price. 6)  Adds a mechanism to require withholding of the tax by purchasers. Residential consumers and small business are exempt. 7)  Requires sellers to file annual tax returns to report the tax on excess gross receipts and pay any remaining tax due. 8)  The measure sunsets after five (5) years. There will be a report after today's Assembly Rev & Tax Cmte hearing. As opposed to SB 1x that returns the taxes raised to ratepayers, AB 128x  would ""repay"" the State's General Fund.

The bill was completely rewritten in committee to do the following.  I will fax bill language to Houston, Portland and San Francisco.  If anyone else would like language, please e-mail me.  a.    Create a Tax on Excess Gross Receipts from Electrical Energy Distribution.  b.    Impose the tax on the person making the first sale of electrical power in or into California for consumption.  c.    Establish as the measure for the tax, the amount by which the gross receipts from the sale exceed the amount that        would have been received if the sale had been made at a specified price (the 'base price').  d.    Establish a $60 base price.  e.    Create a rebuttable presumption that the base price represents a fair sales price.  f.    Add a mechanism to require withholding of the tax from purchasers, other than purchasers who are residential consumers or small business users.  g.    Require sellers to file annual tax returns to report the tax on excess gross receipts and pay any remaining tax due.  h.

Davis' promise     ---------------------------------------------------------------------- This article was sent to you by someone who found it on SF Gate. The original article can be found on SFGate.com here: http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2001/05/09/MN197841.DTL ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Wednesday, May 9, 2001 (SF Chronicle) It's bad, and it'll get worse/TROUBLE AHEAD: Extra power for summer will fall  well short of Gov. Davis' promise Carolyn Said, Chronicle Staff Writer      California will get only one-third of the new power that Gov. Gray Davis promised to deliver by July 1, virtually ensuring a brutal summer of blackouts for the energy-strapped state.    Davis had pledged to take emergency measures to get 5,000 extra megawatts up and running by summer. Instead, the state will have 1,698 megawatts of the promised new power by July 1, according to the California Energy Commission. Even by Sept. 1, California will have added just 3,669 megawatts.    The goal of 5,000 megawatts -- enough to power 5 million homes -- was crucial because it represents the gap between expected supply and demand this summer.    ""We're still hopeful we can get as many megawatts online this summer as possible,"" said Davis spokesman Roger Salazar. ""But we understand there are issues involved in the siting and construction of new power plants.""    In fact, experts said, there are so many obstacles that the governor's plan was unrealistic to begin with.    ""There are limits to what you can reasonably accomplish,"" said Arthur O'Donnell, editor and associate publisher of the California Energy Markets newsletter.    Without a way to plug the gap between supply and demand, California can expect a long, dark summer.    ""Any warm day from May to October -- it doesn't even have to be abnormally warm -- California is going to be at risk for blackouts,"" said Michael Zenker, director of Cambridge Energy Research Associates, an energy and economics consulting firm based in California.    He predicts that rolling blackouts in the state this summer will be ""in the hundreds of hours. I expect Californians will grow pretty weary of them pretty quickly.""    The California Independent System Operator, which oversees about 85 percent of the state's straining grid, has said that anytime its load hits 40,000 megawatts or above, California will be at risk of involuntary outages. Last summer, that mark was reached on 34 days.    Whether this summer will exceed that number of days or not depends heavily on the weather. If it's a cool summer, California might squeak by with relatively low power demand and fewer blackouts. If the mercury rises, electricity use will soar as people crank up their air conditioners, and the lights will go off for tens of thousands of customers at a time.    This week's warm temperatures and concurrent rolling blackouts are a clear harbinger of a pattern expected all summer. Although power plants that were offline for maintenance aggravated the situation, the week's two blackouts ""tend to indicate that the blackouts we'll have as we get further into the summer will be deeper and more sustained,"" said Zenker.    Exacerbating the state's inability to generate enough homegrown power is the situation in the Pacific Northwest, where drought conditions are severely curtailing hydroelectric production, meaning that California cannot count on imports this summer.    The state's next best hope for coping with the warm weather will be enticing consumers and businesses to raise their thermostats, shut off their lights and shift their heavy usage to ""off-peak"" hours.    ""To avoid blackouts in California, we're going to need conservation,"" said Jim McIntosh, director of operations for the ISO.    Cutting consumption by 10 percent could get 5,000 megawatts off the grid, according to Davis. And the Energy Commission says that various measures enacted last September, such as incentives for businesses to paint their roofs white (reducing their air-conditioning needs), will save 281 megawatts by June 1 and 334 megawatts by August. The governor's latest, $800 million campaign to encourage conservation could save an additional 2,061 megawatts by summer's end.    But energy experts say Davis may be overly rosy in his projections for cuts in home consumption.    That's because the expected rate increases for electricity won't hit until June, so customers would first see a spike in their bills in July. Psychologically, many people will start serious conservation measures only once they've taken a hit in their pocketbooks.    Although Californians have already cut back enough to save 2,866 megawatts during April, ""I don't think more (conservation) will happen,"" said Michael Shames, head of the Utility Consumers Action Network. ""Markets move slowly when it comes to changing energy conservation patterns.""    Davis's ambitious building plan took several routes to add up to 5,000 megawatts. In part, it relied on three huge power plants -- Los Medanos, Sutter and Sunrise -- that had already been under construction for years and are certain to come online this summer. But much of it was based on getting dozens of small energy providers to either increase output or build new facilities. Those efforts foundered on several issues:    -- QFs: Davis was counting on getting dozens of so-called ""qualifying facilities"" -- or QFs, basically small alternative energy generators -- to ramp up production. That, plus restarting of two existing power plants, would have added 1,244 megawatts. Instead, most QFs will produce only the bare minimum, and one of the power plants may not be restarted.    The QFs, which are paid directly by California's utilities, are still owed millions of dollars for power they produced in December and January. And a new payment scheme enacted by the California Public Utilities Commission will slash payments for power they generate in the future. QFs say they will actually lose money if they run full tilt because they can't recoup their natural-gas costs.    -- Peakers: Small, temporary power plants called peakers accounted for 2, 133 megawatts of Davis's plan. Although the Energy Commission sped up licensing for peakers, many firms were competing for scarce resources to get the mini power plants built.    ""There's an internal competition (among power firms) for transmission interconnections, for natural-gas pipeline space, for turbine parts,"" O'Donnell said. ""I felt a fairly large amount of optimism was built into (the peaker plan) to begin with.""     E-mail Carolyn Said at csaid@sfchronicle.com. Coming up short    How much more power Gov. Davis pledged to bring online by July 1:    5,000 megawatts    How much more power the state actually will have by July 1:    1,698 megawatts    How much the state will add by Sept. 1    3,669 megawatts. .

Direct access customers are exempt from the surcharge.  Each customer class is allocated an equal 3 cents, plus an amount to cover  the shortfall from having residential usage up to 130% of baseline exempt  from the surcharge (as required by law).  Each decision allocates a  substantial portion of the subsidy to non-residential classes, although Lynch  does this to a lesser extent The new rates become effective June 1, and the shortfall from the actual  effective date of the increase, March 27, through June 1 will be amortized  over 12 months. Residential rate design - 5 tiers will be put in place; the 5th tier (300+%  of baseline) gets a 35 cent per kwh rate Non-residential rate design - recommendations to put all of the increase into  summer on-peak were rejected.

We are highly troubled that this  amendment is being pursued at the Federal level.

Congressman Radanovich is welcome to offer an amendment on this  issue next week.  The following language is based on some language we tried  to have inserted at the State level.  Unfortunately, AB1X passed in January  prohibits direct access and competition among sellers for buyers of  electricity.  Without a free market for electricity and with all electricity  purchases going through a state-mandated exchange, the taxpayers of  California are left with paying the bill or electricity: DRAFT LANGUAGE FOR DIRECT ACCESS IMPLEMENTATION Not later than thirty days after enactment, the Independent System Operator  (""ISO""), shall submit to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (""FERC"") a  transmission congestion relief program that incorporates physical rights to  firm transmission through congestable interfaces. Such rights will confer on  users the right to access transmission through the interfaces without  incurring congestion fees. The rights will provide access for periods judged  to serve direct access market participants of up to one year. Initial  provision of these rights will be through an annual auction overseen by the  ISO. The rights will be resalable. Not later than thirty days after enactment,  the program will implement  direct access for large non-residential users of electric power. The program  will require large industrial, commercial and other non-residential users of  electricity to fulfill their electric power needs by contracting with  non-investor owned utilitiy (""IOU"") sources in accordance with the following  schedule: 90 days after enactment: 1 megawatt and greater loads 180 days after enactment: 300 kilowatt and greater loads 270 days after enactment: 100 kilowatt and greater loads 360 days after enactment: 70 kilowatt and greater loads.  This program will permit large industrial, commercial, and other  non-residential users of electricity to voluntarily enter into contracts to  fulfill any portion of their own electric power needs through direct  contracting with non-IOU sources.

Whereas the FERC order REQUIRED  the ISO to get creditworthy parties -- the ISO portrayed it as an obligation  of the buying party.  Therefore, the ISO's letter says that the ONLY party to  come forward to provide credit support was DWR -- and because of DWR's  ""fiduciary obligation to conserve the finite resources that have been placed  at its disposal"", DWR REQUIRED access to the ISO's control room floor and  non-public data.  This is outrageous and just shows that the ISO has, in  effect, become a state-run, vertically-integrated utility. Question -- do we  want to protest this? Or sit by and see what the generators do?

Market Participants argue that they require access to the attachments in order to respond to the FOIA request.  The March 1 motion requested confidential treatment for the attachments ""although the ISO and the EOB do not believe that confidential treatment is required under the ISO Tariff"" because they were nonetheless ""concerned that release of the information contained in the appendices at this time could adversely affect the ngotiations currently underway between the State of California and the generators"".  Since these concerns exist, the CA ISO cannot release the confidential appendices.  Attached however are the cover sheets to each table which describe in detail what is contained in each table.  This information should assist Market Participants interested in the matter to prepare any response they may wish to submit to FERC.  Again, Market Participants should not rely on the CA ISO to make their arguments for them.   Jeanne M.

Market Participants argue that they require access to the attachments in order to respond to the FOIA request.  The March 1 motion requested confidential treatment for the attachments ""although the ISO and the EOB do not believe that confidential treatment is required under the ISO Tariff"" because they were nonetheless ""concerned that release of the information contained in the appendices at this time could adversely affect the ngotiations currently underway between the State of California and the generators"".  Since these concerns exist, the CA ISO cannot release the confidential appendices.  Attached however are the cover sheets to each table which describe in detail what is contained in each table.

My  group of merchant generators and power marketers include many pre-competition Edison empoyees, and employees from  other utilities as well.  We are sympathetic to the situation of those who currently serve under the Edison  banner.   We note, however, that something is amiss in your series, and only lightly  touched.  That is, the role of SCE in advancing the legislation and policies in favor of competition in Californa.   It was SCE, and its CEO Mr. Bryson who masterminded the state deregulation  legislation.  Although SCE's Mr. Bryson  objected vigorously to forced sales of power plants, and asked for  long terms power purchase contracts, those lost battles gave way to winning the stranded-cost-recovery war.   SCE did well in adopting to the new reality, until the wholesale rates flew  up, and left the utility unable to recover its costs.  SCE made a deliberate calculation in May of 2000 to leave its  customers unprotected from cost shocks.  There was no hedging undertaken for future power purchases when the wholesale  forward prices exceeded SCE's historical generation component of rates.  As a result, the debts piled up.   Empathize with career employees of SCE, and with dedicated, hard working  linemen who are always ready to serve at the cost of their private pleasures. But please, get it right.  Much of this  misery was the avoidable direct consequence of actions taken by, not avoided, by the SCE management team.   Gary B.

The CPUC currently  has the attached version posted on its website, although the  final version  may differ somewhat.? The decision continues to provide (see  p. 29) that  Direct Access?customers will not be subject to the  surcharge, as AReM has  advocated. ? Based on some of the discussion which occurred at oral  argument on Friday,  the decision now has wording indicating that although the  utilities are  authorized to include the load of DA customers in calculating the  revenue  requirement associated with the surcharge, DA customers do not have to  pay  the surcharge for the same reasons AReM expressed repeatedly in the   proceeding.? Any shortfall in utility revenues due to including DA demand  in  the revenue requirement will be allocated on an equal cents/kWh basis to all   non-exempt sales.? It is noted that this may shift costs to residential   customers ""since the majority of direct access demand, and thus the majority  of  the resulting shortfall, is non-residential."" ? The decision also makes clear that DA customers will not be  entitled to  include the surcharge under the current direct access credit system  and that  the Commission intends to reexamine and restructure the current direct   access credit system ""to reflect current structural reality.""? Hopefully,   this will mean movement to a ""bottoms-up"" calculation methodology, as AReM  has  also advocated.? My understanding from Peter Bray is that Commissioner   Bilas made some remarks indicating that he would support instituting a   proceeding to restructure DA pricing. ? This is the result we wanted with regard to exempting DA  customers from the  surcharge.? We now need to see if TURN or any other  consumer advocacy group  chooses to challenge the allocation methodology for any  shortfall.?  ?

"FERC issued three CA orders today.  Ray Alvarez sent out a summary on the  order related to increasing Generation and Transmission in the west. The  report below came from IEP's attorney.  Underscheduling -- Enron has been on both sides on this issue -- here's  what's happened  One CA order rejects the requests by PG&E, SoCal Edison and the CAISO to suspend the underscheduling penalty adopted in the December 15th Order.  The Commission is currently reviewing data filed by the CAISO in conjunction with a request to waive the underscheduling and will address the underscheduling penalty in a future order.  The Order does accept the CAISO's proposal to split the BEEP stack into Operating Reserves and Imbalance Energy.   QFs -- Ridgewood Complaint  The second order address QF issues.  Granting, in part, Ridgewood and CCC's request for emergency relief, the Commission ruled that when QFs sell excess power or make third party sales as authorized by a court, the California utilities must provide interconnection and transmission service to make those sales.  The Commission deferred decision on whether QFs that have not been fully paid can make third party bilateral sales.   Obstacles -- Subject of Ray's earlier e-mail  The third order addresses obstacles to increased energy supply.  The Commission takes a number of actions, including allowing premium returns on equity (200 basis points) and accelerated depreciation (10 years) for projects that increase transmission capacity in the short term (July 1, 2001).  The basis points go down if the project comes on later.  The order also allows rolled-in treatment of interconnection and upgrade costs for new supply, broadens and extends QF waivers of operating and efficiency standards, waives prior notice requirements and grants market-based rate authority for sales from back-up and self-generation in WSCC, authorizes certain demand side sales and management programs, and encourages pipeline construction projects.  More to follow when we review the orders.  Sue Mara Enron Corp.

"The feeling on the street is that Reliant was setup with the $1900 sale.  The  word is that the bid for $1900 power had been sitting there for months and  that Reliant had an ""understanding"" with DWR and the ISO that the bid was not  supposed to be taken except in dire need -- it's for a peaker and the price  represents the opportunity cost of running it now, and using up its very  limited emission credits, rather than running it during the real peak times  this summer. The $1900 represents the estimated cost to Reliant of Reliant  having to buy power this summer on the market when it otherwise would have  had its peaker available.  The wors is that the state/ISO took the bid, when  there was not dire need, just to make Reliant look evil and point to ever  higher prices -- when? -- yes, the week before the Bush plan was to come out.

Reliant Energy believes that these accusations are politically motivated  attempts to demonize Reliant Energy as an outsider responsible for causing  the state's energy crisis. The accusations are simply not based on fact. More  importantly, the governor's attacks have done nothing to increase the state's  supply of electricity or prevent the blackouts expected this summer. If  anything, the comments have fostered an atmosphere of distrust and  uncertainty that have further destabilized the market.   ``Reliant hopes the governor and others will stop these baseless accusations  and focus on true solutions to California's energy shortage,'' said Joe Bob  Perkins, president and chief operating officer, Reliant Energy Wholesale  Group. ``We are now being singled out because we believe in an open market,  not government control of power generation, and we have offered solutions  that do not jibe with the governor's political agenda. Contrary to the  perception Governor Davis is attempting to promote, we have been focused on  providing solutions that are fair to all parties in California since the  outset of this crisis. In fact, earlier this week we provided the governor's  office with an outline of a series of emergency measures that, if pursued  quickly, could help mitigate the power crisis this summer. We are still  waiting on a response.''   Perkins pointed out many of the steps Reliant Energy has taken to keep the  lights on in California, disputing the accusation of being  ``obstructionist'':   Reliant Energy has run its 30-to-50-year-old plants at the highest levels  since their purchase in 1998. In 2000, Reliant nearly doubled the output from  these plants to meet the needs of Californians -- running them at levels far  exceeding the prior owner, Southern California Edison.  Reliant Energy invested $80 million dollars in 2000 alone to upgrade plants  to make sure the most power possible is available during peak times. In  addition, the company improved emissions levels to clean up the environment  and keep costs for emission credits to a minimum.  For the last two years, Reliant has encouraged the Investor Owned Utilities  and the state to invest in long-term contracts to stabilize rates instead of  relying on the spot market. In particular, Reliant Energy offered to sell  power at two cents per kilowatt-hour if the buyer would purchase the natural  gas required to generate the power, ensuring a transparent cost of power.  Reliant Energy has never shut down generation despite the prevalent concerns  that continue to exist over credit issues. In contrast, just last week a  major out-of-state supplier refused to continue to sell to California unless  payment was forthcoming.  Reliant Energy has created an aggressive curtailment plan to encourage  businesses to ``sell back'' power voluntarily to add more power to the  Western power grid. The company has met with many leaders in Western states  to introduce the program, yet California officials will not even engage in a  dialogue on the program.   ``We welcome the opportunity to discuss these issues one-on-one with the  governor,'' Perkins said. ``Unfortunately, he has repeatedly refused this  request over the past year. Last week's meeting with generators was the first  time the group was allowed to speak with him directly, and obviously the  purpose of that meeting was political grandstanding.''   Perkins added that the governor's accusations of opposing court orders are  unfounded. ``We have always worked within the law and are proud of our  commitment to keeping the lights on. We have followed all court orders and  worked closely with the FERC and others to cooperate fully with all  investigations. When necessary, we have filed court challenges to orders that  we believe violate our rights -- hardly an illegal action.''

"Tuesday, May 22, 2001  Legislators Set to Sue Federal Energy Agency   Power: Lawmakers try a new idea: a lawsuit arguing that blackouts pose  danger to people, law enforcement and even water supply.    By DAN MORAIN, Times Staff Writer       SACRAMENTO--Legislative Democrats today will sue federal energy  regulators, charging that their inaction threatens elderly people in nursing  homes, children in day care centers, law enforcement and its ability to fight  crime, and the state's drinking water supplies.       Rather than focus on record wholesale energy costs, the lawsuit takes a  new tack, homing in on the threat to health and safety posed by California's  energy crisis and the blackouts likely this summer.       A draft of the suit seeks to force the Federal Energy Regulatory  Commission to set ""just and reasonable"" wholesale power rates as a way of  ending the crisis before blackouts occur. The action is being filed by  veteran trial attorney Joe Cotchett on behalf of Senate President Pro Tem  John Burton (D-San Francisco), Assembly Speaker Bob Hertzberg (D-Sherman  Oaks), and the city of Oakland.       ""A crisis of unprecedented dimensions is already taking shape in  California,"" the draft says. ""The public health, safety and welfare of the  state's 34 million residents is in jeopardy due to the tragic consequences of  rolling blackouts and punitive prices.""        Suit Says Blackouts Pose Threats       Until now, most California officials, including Gov. Gray Davis, have  been urging that the regulatory commission cap wholesale power prices as a  way of limiting costs to the state, which has spent more than $6 billion  buying electricity since January.       In the lawsuit, Cotchett will be arguing that while higher bills will  stretch the budgets of people on fixed incomes, frail elderly people ""are  left to wonder if their oxygen tanks, drip IVs, dialysis machines and  electricity-powered therapeutic beds will respond when they are needed.""       ""Rolling blackouts represent more than just an annoyance for the men,  women and children with disabilities,"" the suit says. ""They represent an  imminent threat to life, health and independence.""       Cotchett said the suit will be filed in the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of  Appeals in San Francisco, bypassing the federal trial court. Cotchett said  the circuit court has direct jurisdiction over FERC.       Joining Cotchett will be Clark Kelso, a professor at McGeorge Law School  in Sacramento who briefly was insurance commissioner last year after Chuck  Quackenbush resigned. Kelso said he initially was skeptical that lawmakers  had legal standing to sue. But after Cotchett spoke with him, Kelso said he  became convinced the suit had merit.       ""Let's face it,"" said Kelso, a Republican, ""this is the single most  important issue that the state faces for the next six months.""        Watching the Water Supply       The suit cites warnings from governmental agencies about the  implications of blackouts, including one the state Department of Health  Services issued earlier this month to public water agencies statewide. The  warning contains a sample notice that local water authorities should give to  consumers.       ""If the water looks cloudy or dirty,"" the warning says, ""you should not  drink it."" The warning suggests that if people are concerned about water  quality, they can boil it or add ""eight drops of household bleach to one  gallon of water, and let it sit for 30 minutes.""       Most water agencies have back-up generators. But the suit says that ""if  an agency's water treatment facilities are hit by a power outage, a two-hour  blackout can result in two-day interruptions in providing safe drinking water  because of time needed to bring equipment back online and flush potentially  contaminated water from the system.""

" Here is what I have been able to do on the list of accomplishments.  Tim  Belden said it was impossible to quantify what we had done for the western  market on a P/L basis for ENA, but that it was very important for creating a  good market going forward. Nonetheless, he gave me a number (I thought a  pretty low one)  based on what it would mean for his own P/L. I'm waiting to  hear something back on one other item from EES.

"Jim,  Here are my proposed changes to what you have said -- in color.  Here is the language keeping DA alive -- the decision is attached (it's short)   D01-03-009,  page 6 , March 7, 2001 ""Finally, due to pending legislation which would alter Section 80110, we  shall stay action on implementation of the suspension of direct access under  Water Code Section 80110 until further order.""  Jeff, Please fill in the discussion of the MOU below (bullet 5).  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ --------  The term ""Surcharge"" is only applicable until the end of the AB1890 rate  freeze (which will end no later than March.31.02 and may end earlier if (a)  federal court finds in PG&E/SCE favor or (b) California legislature mandates  an earlier end-date or (c) the CPUC decides to actually complete its  proceeding to value the retained assets and calculate an end to the rate  freeze, which would take months.  Surcharge is a ""term of art"" to get around  the problems of the AB1890 rate freeze.   At the end of the AB1890 rate freeze, it is my understanding that the CPUC  will modify fully the rate structure and level to ensure full cost recovery  on a going forward basis (therefore Utility Retained Generation, QF expense,  CDWR current expenses (both energy purchase and financing costs will be  included). Some members of the CPUC signaled in the May 5 decision (noted  below) that they intended to investigate ""bottoms up"" rate making -- this is  preferred by AReM and many others.  Theoretically, it would clearly separate  generation-procurement-retail sales functions from other charges, such as T  and D.  DA sustomers would only be charged for T & D etc. -- not the other.  If done correctly, even charges included now in T & D, such as some  ISO-related functions, would be moved out to make the T&D charges pure wires  charges.  This approach would be preferred. Any ""bottoms up"" proceeding would  take months and unlikely to be concluded before the end of this year. Other outstanding costs will include (1) Utility Undercollection from May.00  until when no additional CA-ISO costs are applied or until rates cover costs  and (2) CDWR costs beginning Jan.17.01 until the end of AB1890 rate freeze or  the end of DWR's purchasing activities. Understanding how all these costs will be recovered and by whom will most  likely (80% probability) be decided by the Legislature with some  decision-making by the CPUC. If theLegislature does not take this up, it will  be decided by the bankruptcy court or federal court. Utility Undercollection Bypass - 25% So far, the Legislature has done nothing  to address the utility undercollection (except for San Diego, which has a  balancing account but no way to cfollect it yet).  SCE's MOU does address  this by (INSERT BY JEFF). The MOU has received bad reviews by the Legislature  but Enron has been supporting it with some changes and a bi-partisan group of  Legislators has been analyzing it and intends to propose amendments.  Probablility that utility undercollection is dealt with by the Legislature --  50% Various bills in the Legislature have been introduced to delete the language  in AB1X 1that gave the CPUC the right to terminate DA.  A diverse group of  business interests called the Direct Access Coalition has been pushing for  this and for a bill that takes care of DWR's potential stranded cost problem  but provides flexibility for direct access.  Our current assessment is as follows:  Bypass allowed for payment of DWR  costs Jan.17.01 thru rate freeze end  - 80% probability for people who never  were on Utility Service, 50% for people who used Utility Service post  Jan.17.01 but build self-gen or incorporate energy efficiency/load  management; also,  50% chance for 60-90 day amnesty period for people to  select direct access and 50% chance for free direct access (without surcharge  or exit fee) for those who switch while DWR has a ""net short"" position. CDWR Net Unavoidable Bypass - 10% for people who used Utility Service post  Jan.17.01, 80% for others.  LEGISLATION IMPACTING THIS DECISION  There are three key direct access bills being considered (the Bowen bill -  SB2x27, the Kelley bill - AB2x42, and the Battin bill - SB2x??).  The Bowen bill would remove the DA suspension authority granted in AB1x1 and  replace it with the following (1) if a customer has not bought from an  electric utility on or after Jan.17.01 there are no charges [except there may  be an entrance fee to use the electric utility going forward] and (2) if a  customer wants to switch from an electric utility to an ESP they must pay ""to  the department any uncollected amounts equivalent to the department's net  unavoidable cost of power procurement, including any financing costs,  attributable to that customer"" to ensure the satisfaction of any power  purchase obligation or bond obligation to serve ""that customer"".  The  recovery period shall be coincident with the terms of bonds issued to finance  the purchases.  The CPUC has 90 days from the effective date to notify  customers of their obligations.    The Kelley bill would remove the DA suspension authority granted in AB1x1 and  replace it with the following (1) if a customer has not bought from an  electric utility on or after Jan.17.01 there are no charges, (2) every  customer is allowed to buy from an ESP a % of their load equal to the amount  served by Utility Retained Generation (not CDWR purchases) with no charges,  (3) after the effective date, any customer that buys from the electric  utility and wants to switch must pay ""to ensure satisfaction of any power  purchase obligation or bond obligation incurred by the department"" with the  following constraints - (a) for res and small commercial customers, if DA  load is less than load growth or (b) to self gen customers, if the customer  has given 180 days prior notification or (c) if the customer has given DWR 12  months' advance written notice (then only a fee equal to 12 months  unavoidable costs).  The CPUC has 30 days from the effective date to notify  customers of their obligations.  The Battin bill would ... still reviewing   Keep in mind that all of these bills are in flux.  As described above, the DA  Coaltion is pushing hard for a ""good"" direct access bill that provides some  flexibility and has its own language that it is floating.  Even with exit  fees, the Coalition's proposed language would require DWR to base the fee on  a calculation of its actual costs from losing the load.  Enron is also  pushing to make direct access part of any compromise settlement and the  Republicans have taken the same approach.  CPUC DECISIONS IMPACTING THIS  March 7 Decision Implementing ABX 1 -- decided not begin the process to  terminate direct access   May 5 Order - DA doesn't pay DWR expenses going forward and the 3 cent  surcharge does not apply to DA customers.Good for bypass of these costs.  We  expect the utilities to file Petitions to Modify the decision to argue that  they cannot implement it -- they will likely seek to have the charge appply  to DA Customers and then put the same amount in the credit. Given the  problems we all have with the negative credit and the utilities' notion of a  zero bill, there will be much opposition to the utilities' proposal.  The  utilities chance of success on this is less than 50%.  Proposed action -- Alliance for Retail Energy Markets (AReM) will begin  pushing to stop charging the current 1 cent  surcharge to DA customers (to be  consistent with the May 5 decision). Chance of success is 60%.      .  Sue Mara Enron Corp.

"IEP just completed a poll -- Davis' numbers are in ""free fall"".   Relect  Davis -- 28%; Looking for Someone New -- 61%.  IEP is expecting coordinated attacks on the generators and marketers to  continue and increase. Daily beatings -- probably one company after another.   IEP is planning a Cal Journal ad for July to show that blackouts are a supply  problem, not a price problem and may bring LBJ back for another round.  IEP is beginning to work on messages for the summer -- when things are really  expected to get bad.  Planning some pieces (1) how much CA could have saved  if they had entered into long-run contracts last summer; (2) supply issues --  NW problem (town emerging from the muck); (3) outage numbers -- fix now, so  can run during the summer, of course you take gens off line in off-peak hours.

"Sandi, I left Parquet a few v-mails on this.  I haven't heard back, but I assume he  is still interested in retaining local control of property taxes.

The Regulatory Affairs Committee is noticing the entire IEP membership inviting participation by all the commpanies interested in property tax matters.  Last week, Controller Connell indicated an interest in shifting the jurisdiction over property tax assessment applied to electric generators from the local level to the State Board of Equalization (SBE).  IEP engaged in this matter in 1998/1999.  Attached is a brief summary memo of the key issues at that time.  At that time, IEP successfully argued for retaining jurisdictional authority at the local level.  The SBE may take this issue up at its June 20, 2001 meeting.  The SBE is comprised of five voting members.  The membership is divided 3:2 between democrats and republicans.  The initial meeting of the Subcommittee will be a conference call scheduled for 9:30 a.m. (PST) on Thursday, May 31.  During this meeting, we will be discussing policy positions and/or statements that IEP may wish to take, as well as any tactical matters to be addressed at this time.

The Regulatory Affairs Committee is noticing the entire IEP membership inviting participation by all the commpanies interested in property tax matters.  Last week, Controller Connell indicated an interest in shifting the jurisdiction over property tax assessment applied to electric generators from the local level to the State Board of Equalization (SBE).  IEP engaged in this matter in 1998/1999.  Attached is a brief summary memo of the key issues at that time.  At that time, IEP successfully argued for retaining jurisdictional authority at the local level.  The SBE may take this issue up at its June 20, 2001 meeting.  The SBE is comprised of five voting members.  The membership is divided 3:2 between democrats and republicans.  The initial meeting of the Subcommittee will be a conference call scheduled for 9:30 a.m. (PST) on Thursday, May 31.  During this meeting, we will be discussing policy positions and/or statements that IEP may wish to take, as well as any tactical matters to be addressed at this time.  The conference call-in number is                    800/486-2460 The Call-in Number is                                         111756 (See attached file: Status Report - IEP Position Adopted 4-23-99.doc)    - ab_81_bill_20010509_amended_asm.url  - Status Report - IEP Position Adopted 4-23-99.doc",sandra.mccubbin@enron.com,susan.mara@enron.com,"Re: Creation of IEP Property Tax Subcommittee; Conference Call  Scheduled for 9:30 a.m. (PST) on Thursday, May 31 -- MIGDEN BILL",2001-05-29 10:29:00-07:00,sent

"Mirant and Duke Pull In  Mirant and Duke are trying to shut down Gary Ackerman of the WPTF.  This  appears to be coming directly from Gov Davis.  Mirant admitted that Gov Davis  had pressured them to shut down Gary (presumably as part of Mirant's recently  completed negotiations over a long-term power sale). Mirant said it may be  leaving WPTF if it doesn't get its way.  Reliant was also talking general  caution.  So far, the majority of WPTF members are holding firm.  Gary will  continue his outreach with media but curb the use of any inflammatory  language.  Reliant's FallOut From Advertising  Reliant has run a bit of image advertising in CA in a few newspapers.  They  were contacted by an organization that supposedly represents black-owned  newspapers. The organization will begin running a campaign against Reliant  saying the company is racist and should be boycotted.  Direct Access and the Dems (through Alliance for Retail Markets contacts)  The Governor's office has said that ""you'll get direct access, but you won't  like it"" and mentioned requiring DA customers to pick up $3.5 billion in  ""overcharges""  --  ""You people wanted deregulation and are responsible for  the way it turned out, so now you have to pay for it.""  Sen. Burton(Majority  Leader) said that its ""too soon"" for direct access. And Sen. Bowen's (chair  Senate Energy Com) energy advisor said ""There will never be an unfettered  right to direct access, so don't keep pushing for it."" AReM will step up  efforts to educate the Dems and attempt to get a powerful Dem to champion the  cause.  Also, three separate rumor sources said that Loretta Lynch is moving  ahead on her own, without Davis' approval, and that the Governor's office is  in a tizzy about it -- even thinking of politically-correct ways to get her  out of there -- judgeships anyone?

"From my sources:  CA ISO is filing jointly with SCE and SDG&E.  The comments begin with a tyrade that FERC has no right to condition price caps on joining an RTO.  Apparently, they weakly support regional organizations and note agreement to work with the other RTOs that are now forming.  PG&E is filing separate comments ""because of its bankruptcy."" PG&E will note concern about the CA ISO ""independence"" and talks about other RTOs as potentially good options.  The CPUC ordered and berated PG&E to file its comments with the CPUC BEFORE submitting them to FERC.  PG&E initially protested, but was threatened with fines.  It finally filed yesterday under seal.  Bottomline:  I believe that the joint ISO/IOU filing is structured to provide the minimal needed to meet the FERC test. Therefore, FERC's price caps will remain in effect.  Sue Mara Enron Corp.

The original article can be found on SFGate.com here: http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2001/06/06/MN199202.DTL ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Wednesday, June 6, 2001 (SF Chronicle) Dramatic drop in cost of electricity/LOWER BILLS: Cheaper fuel, milder  weather credited David Lazarus, Chronicle Staff Writer      California electricity prices have plunged unexpectedly to their lowest level in more than a year, partly as the result of a simultaneous drop in prices for natural gas, which fuels most power plants.    Make no mistake: Gas and electricity prices could surge upward again in months ahead.    But for the first time since California's energy markets went haywire last summer, industry experts are beginning to ask whether the state finally may have turned a corner in its battle with runaway power costs.    ""California is not yet out of the woods,"" said Kelley Doolan, who tracks natural gas prices for energy market researcher Platts. ""But this is a very significant decrease in costs.""    Along with lower gas prices, the decline in electricity costs was attributed by state and industry officials to milder weather, which reduces demand for power. They also credited recent conservation efforts by consumers and better-than-expected runoff at dams for hydroelectric plants.    Gary Ackerman, executive director of the Western Power Trading Forum, an energy-industry association, said these factors came together to produce the lowest wholesale electricity prices since April 2000.    Electricity on the spot market could have been purchased yesterday for as little as $50 per megawatt hour, he noted, compared with more than $500 earlier this year.    ""If the weather stays this way, we could have reasonable prices all summer, "" Ackerman said. ""We may also have fewer blackouts.""    It is tempting for Californians to be suspicious of virtually any swing in energy prices. If power companies manipulated prices on the way up, as critics have alleged, might they not be up to some trick as prices head in the opposite direction?    Nettie Hoge, executive director of The Utility Reform Network in San Francisco, speculated that generators are allowing electricity prices to fall so they can discourage federal regulators from taking a more active role in the dysfunctional California market.    ""They're trying to take the heat off,"" she said.    Others cautioned that the lower prices may be nothing more than a statistical blip.    ""This was just one month's decline,"" said Michael Shames, executive director of the Utility Consumers' Action Network in San Diego. ""We really have to see how this plays out in the future.""    Steve Maviglio, a spokesman for Gov. Gray Davis, said the governor was very encouraged by the lower energy prices. Davis announced Sunday that California's power use was down 11 percent last month from a year before.    ""We're not there yet,"" Maviglio said of whether an end to the state's power woes is in sight. ""But the trend is pointing in the right direction.""    WHITE ELEPHANT    Yet this sudden drop in energy prices does have a dark side: California could end up with a huge white elephant after spending about $40 billion in public funds on long-term power contracts.    The logic behind the contracts, which are at an average price of $69 per megawatt hour over 10 years, is that the state expected to pay below-market rates for electricity for a number of years before prices came down and California found itself paying above-market rates.    If current trends continue, though, California will find itself paying consistently above-market rates much sooner than expected, making the long- term contracts a sweet deal for the same power companies that profited so handsomely during the state's darkest hours.    ""The contracts look really ugly right now,"" said Shames at the Utility Consumers' Action Network. ""They may be way overpriced.""    Maviglio, the governor's spokesman, said it is too early to conclude that the state did poorly negotiating dozens of long-term power contracts.    ""No one has a crystal ball on this,"" he said.    CUSTOMERS' BILLS TO DROP    In any case, Pacific Gas and Electric Co. said yesterday that customers' average gas bills will drop 26 percent this month to $26 and should stay near that level all summer.    Platts, which monitors average monthly spot prices, found that the wholesale price of gas at the California-Oregon border has tumbled nearly 42 percent since the beginning of May -- from $9.98 per million British thermal units to $5.81.    The wholesale gas price at the California-Arizona border fell 45 percent, from $11.91 to $6.50. This compares with a 25 percent monthly decline in average natural gas prices nationwide.    However, California gas prices are still about 50 percent higher than they were a year ago, whereas national prices are now below year-ago levels for the first time since last spring.    While cooler weather nationwide helped push gas prices down overall, Doolan attributed the especially steep drop in California to a commensurate surge in prices last month related to fears of a long, hot summer of rolling blackouts.    ""You had state officials all but promising rolling blackouts this summer,"" he said. ""That created enormous demand for electricity generation.    ""What has changed is that we've had weeks of mild weather,"" Doolan observed.    ""The electricity generators have not come out of the woodwork buying up all the gas.""    This allowed utilities like PG&E to beef up gas inventories, which eased demand and resulted in substantially lower prices, he said.    'BACK ON TRACK'    ""We're back on track to be completely full for winter,"" said Staci Homrig, a PG&E spokeswoman. ""That's a very good thing.""    Gas prices historically dip in the spring and summer and then rise again in the winter. PG&E is forecasting that customers' average gas bills could rise to as high as $75 in December if current trends continue.    However, the precipitous drop in gas prices in recent weeks suggests that California's unusually high costs at last may be abating.    Individual power companies so far are reluctant to speculate on whether the drop in gas prices will have a lasting effect on electricity costs.

"From one of the ARM members below. Our latest info is that there are still 3  votes in SUPPORT of direct access. So, this measure would fail if that  SUPPORT stays in place.  ARM and others plan a campaign to attack this draft  decision.  From Commonwealth: I have that Linda Serizawa, Commissioner Wood's advisor, has stated that Commissioner Wood is at this moment drafting the decision on direct access. She indicated that a draft order would be released, but would not say when. She stated that ABX1-1 directed the CPUC to set a date at which time a customer would no longer have the right to switch to an ESP, and indicated that this order, as it is currently drafted, establishes that date. Apparently there was great hesitant when making the statement ""as it is presently drafted,"" indicating to that Wood is getting a lot of pressure not to set the date.   Sue Mara Enron Corp.

What the public wants in a solution to the energy crisis:  ?  Re-regulation (restore balance to system). Very small, if any, rate increases. Reliability of supply (no more blackouts).

The feds have refused to obey the law to maintain fair &=20 reasonable rates. Restore fairness:? Solutions must protect residential and small business=20 users. Re-regulation:? Reassert our authority over California=01,s energy destiny. Stability & Reliability:? Increase supply and keep a lid on rates.  ?  ?  Goals of the Fair Plan:  ?  Provide customers with reliable power and stable rates. Restore regulated utilities to credit-worthiness to enable them to resume= =20 role of energy supplier. Ensure that mega-users of electricity have direct access to independent=20 electricity providers to protect California=01,s economy.  ?  ?  Many elements of the proposed Edison MOU remain unchanged, except for: Option to purchase the transmission system. Re-regulates service for all residential and small business consumers.

Enron, along with the members of the Alliance for Retail  Energy Markets, are launching an all-out campaign to get the decision  changed.

We are hearing that the CPUC may not have 3 votes in favor of such  suspension, but the topic is on the agenda.  It is very difficult to get any  clarity on this issue given the politics and ex parte restricitions.  Even if the CPUC does not take action on this language at the next meeting,  until that provision of the law is modified by the General Assembly, the CPUC  could take action at a later time.

Printer-friendly version  LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--The California Independent System Operator has filed a motion with federal energy regulators asking that four major power suppliers in California be stripped of their ability to charge market rates because they have allegedly gamed the wholesale electricity market.  Duke Energy (DUK, news, msgs), Dynegy Inc. (DYN, news, msgs), Mirant Corp. (MIR, news, msgs) and Reliant Energy Inc. (REI, news, msgs) have been identified by the ISO as exercising market power - the ability to influence electricity prices - in California's wholesale power market.  The ISO, which manages the state's high-voltage transmission system, recently made a similar filing against AES Corp. (AES, news, msgs) and Williams Cos. (WMB, news, msgs), claiming those companies have profited excessively in California by exercising market power.  The ISO wants the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to revoke generators' authority to charge market-based rates for their power supply.  Tom Williams, spokesman for Duke Energy, said the company had just received the FERC filing and is reviewing the allegations.  ""We've obviously just got the filing and we're reviewing it and we are going to respond with our own FERC filing. But we're also gratified that market forces are at work in California and prices have come down,"" Williams said.  Richard Wheatley, a spokesman for Reliant, said the ISO's allegations are ""nothing new.""  ""It's similar in nature to issues and allegations that have been raised against other generators,"" Wheatley said. ""The ISO is incorrect in asking for emergency relief. The situation in California remains to be an imbalance between supply and demand. The blame game prohibits lasting solutions from being reached and the business climate in California will be affected by finger pointing.""  Steve Maviglio, press secretary to Gov. Gray Davis, said the governor ""strongly supports any attempt to bring prices down for Californians and to break the grip a handful of generators have on the electricity market.""  The ISO has asked FERC to terminate by June 28 Dynegy's ability to charge market prices for power from its Southern California power plants and to schedule a hearing to determine rates based on the energy company's production costs.  The grid operator also wants Dynegy to refund billions of dollars, retroactive to May 1, ""of the difference between cost-based rates...and the market revenues actually received.""  Similar requests were made with FERC against Duke, Reliant and Mirant.  ""The ISO has submitted compelling evidence that the exercise of market power is more pervasive than the commission has acknowledged...,"" according to the filing.  In the filing, generators have also been accused of ""megawatt-laundering,"" in which suppliers sell power out-of-state that is resold to California at a higher price.  California consumers have spent $7 billion for wholesale electricity in 1999, $27 billion in 2000 and could pay as much as $50 billion this year.  Charles Robinson, the ISO's chief counsel, said he is ""optimistic"" the state will prevail ""in one forum or another and will be able to get the relief we're seeking.""  He said FERC should implement an ""effective"" market mitigation plan that will put the brakes on skyrocketing wholesale power prices.  FERC set up a market mitigation plan, which went into effect June 1, to stabilize wholesale power prices when operating reserves dip below 7%. Robinson said that plan wasn't good enough.  Wholesale power prices were at a seven-month low Thursday, due in part to the new FERC plan, cooler temperatures, low natural-gas prices, and conservation measures, energy officials said.  Every three years, FERC reviews generators' ability to charge market rates for electricity. Generators were first allowed to charge market rates three years ago, but it is unclear whether FERC has ever stripped suppliers from their right to charge market prices.

Tel: (415) 782-7802 Fax:(415) 782-7854 ----- Forwarded by Susan J Mara/NA/Enron on 06/14/2001 11:51 AM -----   ""Beiser, Megan"" <Megan.Beiser@edelman.com>  06/13/2001 04:39 PM        To: ""'arem@electric.com'"" <arem@electric.com>    cc:     Subject: FYI: Sacramento Bee--Dan Walters: Repaying huge power debts still   looms as a high political hurdle   Dan Walters: Repaying huge power debts still looms as a high political hurdle  (Published June 13, 2001)  Gov. Gray Davis has been running around California lately proclaiming that California is ""turning the corner"" on the energy crisis, explicitly citing sharply lower wholesale prices for electricity and, implicitly, his improved standing in polls.  Events will reveal whether Davis' June hubris was justified. Despite the recent drop in spot power prices, however, many aspects of the energy crisis remain unresolved, and chief among them is liquidating the $20 billion-plus in debts that utilities and the state have accumulated for power purchases.  A $13.4 billion bond issue that is supposed to reimburse the state's general fund for more than $8 billion advanced for power purchases and then finance future electricity buys has been hung up by demands of potential bond underwriters for more assurances about repayment. The bonds may not be sold until August, if ever. And by then, nearly the entire bond issue may have to flow to the state's general fund, leaving little to finance future power buys.  And then there are the $14 billion or so in debts that the state's two big utilities, Pacific Gas and Electric and Southern California Edison, incurred for power purchases before their credit was cut off in January. PG&E already has declared bankruptcy, and Edison was on the verge when Davis hurriedly signed a ""memorandum of understanding"" (MOU) on a rescue scheme, the centerpieces being state purchase of Edison's share of the intercity power grid, plus a plan for ratepayers to pay off the utility's debts.  The Edison scheme has been denounced as a ""bailout"" by consumer activists and faces certain legislative rejection, despite a multimillion-dollar lobbying and public relations drive by the utility. And it's sparked a complex set of private maneuvers in and around the Capitol that are fraying the already cool relations between Davis and the Legislature's most powerful leader, Senate President Pro Tem John Burton.  Davis called a dozen senators into his office Monday to press approval of the Edison MOU with minimal changes. Burton, who didn't attend, says the governor threatened legislators with rejection of their bills or budget appropriations if they didn't play ball, and promised retaliation if Davis uses strong-arm tactics for Edison.  ""On an issue like this, they (legislators) ought to be able to vote their consciences,"" Burton told reporters, denouncing the Edison deal as a ""flat-ass bailout.""  Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio rejected Burton's account: ""The governor's too smart to do any of that.""  As the public squabbling heats up, so is the private search for a compromise that Edison, consumerists and other principal players can accept -- without much confidence that it can be found. A dizzying array of MOU alternatives is being floated, including an effort by Burton and Assembly Speaker Bob Hertzberg to persuade Edison creditors to write off part of the debt, and for big industrial and power consumers to shoulder the rest in return for recapturing the authority to make power supply deals outside the utility grid.  In effect, the plan would create two power systems, one with regulated rates for individual and small business customers and unregulated ""direct access"" for big users. Former Assemblyman Phil Isenberg, a lobbyist whose firm includes energy generators, is acting as a mediator on behalf of Hertzberg.  Sources close to the negotiations say the big users won't entertain the deal until they know how much power the state has been buying, and at what prices. Davis has insisted on keeping that data secret, and has been sued by the news media and others to force release, but on Tuesday announced that he will agree to opening the supply contracts to inspection.  The chances of an Edison deal coming together this summer are no better than 50-50 -- about the same odds of the state's completing its bond sale. And those uncertainties are compounded by great fears that California still faces the prospect of widespread and prolonged power blackouts this summer. ""I don't think it's over,"" Burton said Tuesday in a jab at Davis.    The Bee's Dan Walters can be reached at (916) 321-1195 or dwalters@sacbee.com .

Following is a summary of what was discussed:  Today's hearing: Where:  Room 3191, 1pm Who: Carol Coy, South Coast Air Quality Management District  SCE was invited but unable to attend due to the bankruptcy issue which  apparently      consumes all of  their time and resources.... Topic:  The ""laundering"" of air emissions credits.   Apparently the cost of  air emissions credits is pushed up due to the laundering of credits by  generators, and as a result should not be used to justify high electricity  prices.    Upcoming Hearings: When:  Friday, June 22 Topic:  Plant operations Who:  TBD  When:  Friday, June 29 Who:   GENERATORS TESTIFY  Other items discussed: Documents requests issued to LADWP and DWR.  LADWP has apparently been very  very very ""very cooperative"" with the request.    Subpoenas have been issued to Duke, Dynegy, AES, NRG, Enron, Reliant,  Williams  A subpoena was issued to SCE requesting the following information:  1.   Internal documents related to the surveillance of market competitiveness.   2.  Maintenance records and 3.  Internal documents related to the sale of  California generation assets.  A subpoena was issued to Morgan Stanley, who was retained to prepare  documents related to the sale of some of California's generation assets.                NOTE:  The point is that the price paid for generation assets  was ""much higher"" than many experts anticipated.  The committee will be  looking into whether generators purchased these assets at significantly  higher prices because they knew they would have market power -- and the  ability to set prices high. Subpoenas will be issued to PG&E and SDG&E   Please feel free to call if you have any other questions.

"On June 13th the Commission issued an Order Denying Rehearing of its April 6th Order on creditworthiness requirements for the CAISO.  The Commission rejected requests by the ISO, California Electricity Oversight Board (CEOB) and the California PUC to weaken the creditworthiness provisions as they apply to DWR, PG&E and SCE.  The order is attached. The FERC also denied the Attorney General's motion to intervene -- this is important because only intervenors can appeal the decision to the courts.  Sue Mara Enron Corp.

"URGENT      WASHINGTON (AP)   Federal regulators voted Monday to order price restraints on electricity sales across the West but not the stringent cost-based controls sought by California.     The 5-0 vote by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission followed intense pressure not only from California Gov. Gray Davis and Democrats newly in charge of the Senate but also from House Republicans worried that spiraling power prices in the West could affect the 2002 election.     FERC Chairman Curtis Hebert said the order, effective through September 2002, will benefit consumers but also will ``provide every incentive for suppliers to reduce costs.''     The order expands price restrictions the agency imposed in April on wholesale electricity sales in California during peak demand periods when blackouts were threatened.  Sue Mara Enron Corp.

Jim  Steffes' office in Houston has a copy.  Both decisions eliminate the requirement that the utilities provide cash  refunds to the direct access customers for the negative PX Credit as of  Januray 5, 2000. On other points they differ.  The decision by Assigned Commissioner Wood is adversarial to direct access  and suspends direct access. If adopted, direct access would be suspended July  1, 2001, except for written contracts executed prior to July 1, 2001.  On the  PX Credit, he says that the cash payment is not required and leaves open the  notion that the bill credit would continue.  The alternate decision by Commissioner Bilas does not suspend direct access  but asks for ideas on how to provide DA given ABX 1 and the concerns of the  state's Dept of Finance when providing comments on the draft decision.  Bilas  has a finding of fact that ""direct access is a necessary component of  restoration of functional electricity markets."" On the PX credit, Bilas'  proposed decision would end the cash payment but begin a process to modify  the PX credit decision (D.99-06-058) and to adopt a bottoms-up calculation  for direct access customers.  He asks for comments in 20 days and reply  comments in 5 days. With a bottoms-up calculation, direct access customers  would pay only wires charges and public purpose charges and pay no charge for  power purchases.  Comments on the draft decisiona are due next Monday, June 25.    Enron and its coalitions will actively support the Bilas alternate and seek  the third vote needed to ensure passage.

WASHINGTON (AP)   California Gov. Gray Davis demanded that power generators refund nearly $9 billion in electricity overcharges and complained that federal regulators have ``looked the other way while energy companies bilked our state.''     Davis told a Senate hearing Wednesday that the decision by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to curtail price spikes in California and 10 other Western states was a step forward.     ``But its actions do nothing about the overcharges'' over the past year, he said.     The governor, a Democrat, has been criticized by Republicans, who charge he has allowed the California power crisis to get out of hand.     Davis defended his actions, saying the state has stepped up approval for new power plants and strengthened conservation programs. He also said the state has little control over price gouging by out-of-state power generators.     ``The governor once said he could solve California's problems in 15 minutes. ... But it appears that California has continued to try and hide the true cost of power by having the state pay for it instead of the utilities,'' putting California taxpayers in jeopardy, said Sen. Frank Murkowski, R-Alaska.     Murkowski said many of the alleged overcharges are by public power entities not under FERC jurisdiction     Sen. Joe Lieberman, D-Conn., chairman of the Governmental Affairs Committee, said the FERC, which regulates wholesale electricity sales, has been slow to respond and ``surprisingly reluctant'' to assure that electricity prices are just and reasonable, as required by the 1934 Federal Power Act.     The agency's response to the Western power problem ``raises serious questions about whether (FERC) has or will oversee the newly deregulated energy markets'' not only in the West but across the rest of the country.     The federal agency, whose commissioners were to testify later in the day, imposed limited, market-based price caps on Monday in California and 10 other Western states from Washington to Arizona. The agency also ordered the parties to attend a conference next week to try to work out agreements on overcharges and other issues.     Months ago, the FERC singled out $124 million in alleged overcharges by power generators. The power companies have since challenged the agency's findings and the matter remains in dispute.     ``To date not a single penny in refunds has been returned to California,'' complained Davis. He said that between May 2000 and the beginning of this month power generators are believed to have overcharged California $8.9 billion.     ``They must be required to give us back our money,'' said Davis. ``It is unconscionable that FERC looked the other way while energy companies bilked our state for up to $9 billion.''     The state spent $7 billion for electricity in 1999 and $27 billion in 2000 and is projected to pay nearly $50 billion this year, said Davis.     ``Power generators have been able to exert extreme power over our energy market,'' he said.     Davis rejected Republican criticism that the state is not addressing the problem. He said newly approved power plants will provide 20,000 additional megawatts of electricity by 2003, including 4,000 megawatts by the end of this summer.     ``Everything that can be done to bring reliable, affordable energy to California is being done ... except wholesale price relief,'' he said.     ``This administration has minimized this crisis (for) more months,'' said Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., alluding to President Bush's repeated refusal to urge the FERC to mitigate electricity prices. Bush has strongly opposed price controls, although he indicated support for FERC's limited price mitigation effort this week.     Murray said the government should issue a disaster declaration so that businesses can get low-income loans, and require that FERC press its investigation into price gouging and demand refunds not only in California but in the Pacific Northwest, where electricity prices have also skyrocketed.     Republicans continued their opposition to more stringent price caps based on the cost of generation at individual power plants.     ``Having a federal agency try to determine what is a just and reasonable price is laughable,'' said Sen. Fred Thompson of Tennessee, the committee's ranking Republican. Hard price caps ``don't work when supply is the problem. ... They make a bad situation worse,'' he said.     After FERC issued its limited price control order this week, Senate Democrats on Tuesday said they would drop legislation to require more stringent cost-based price caps on Western electricity sales.     Democrats in the House, however, said they would continue to pursue a bill requiring the FERC to take more aggressive action.

Gray Davis demanded that power generators refund nearly $9 billion in electricity overcharges and complained that federal regulators have ``looked the other way while energy companies bilked our state.''     Davis told a Senate hearing Wednesday that the decision by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to curtail price spikes in California and 10 other Western states was a step forward.     ``But its actions do nothing about the overcharges'' over the past year, he said.     The governor, a Democrat, has been criticized by Republicans, who charge he has allowed the California power crisis to get out of hand.     Davis defended his actions, saying the state has stepped up approval for new power plants and strengthened conservation programs. He also said the state has little control over price gouging by out-of-state power generators.     ``The governor once said he could solve California's problems in 15 minutes. ... But it appears that California has continued to try and hide the true cost of power by having the state pay for it instead of the utilities,'' putting California taxpayers in jeopardy, said Sen. Frank Murkowski, R-Alaska.     Murkowski said many of the alleged overcharges are by public power entities not under FERC jurisdiction     Sen. Joe Lieberman, D-Conn., chairman of the Governmental Affairs Committee, said the FERC, which regulates wholesale electricity sales, has been slow to respond and ``surprisingly reluctant'' to assure that electricity prices are just and reasonable, as required by the 1934 Federal Power Act.     The agency's response to the Western power problem ``raises serious questions about whether (FERC) has or will oversee the newly deregulated energy markets'' not only in the West but across the rest of the country.     The federal agency, whose commissioners were to testify later in the day, imposed limited, market-based price caps on Monday in California and 10 other Western states from Washington to Arizona. The agency also ordered the parties to attend a conference next week to try to work out agreements on overcharges and other issues.     Months ago, the FERC singled out $124 million in alleged overcharges by power generators. The power companies have since challenged the agency's findings and the matter remains in dispute.     ``To date not a single penny in refunds has been returned to California,'' complained Davis. He said that between May 2000 and the beginning of this month power generators are believed to have overcharged California $8.9 billion.     ``They must be required to give us back our money,'' said Davis. ``It is unconscionable that FERC looked the other way while energy companies bilked our state for up to $9 billion.''     The state spent $7 billion for electricity in 1999 and $27 billion in 2000 and is projected to pay nearly $50 billion this year, said Davis.     ``Power generators have been able to exert extreme power over our energy market,'' he said.     Davis rejected Republican criticism that the state is not addressing the problem. He said newly approved power plants will provide 20,000 additional megawatts of electricity by 2003, including 4,000 megawatts by the end of this summer.     ``Everything that can be done to bring reliable, affordable energy to California is being done ... except wholesale price relief,'' he said.     ``This administration has minimized this crisis (for) more months,'' said Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., alluding to President Bush's repeated refusal to urge the FERC to mitigate electricity prices. Bush has strongly opposed price controls, although he indicated support for FERC's limited price mitigation effort this week.     Murray said the government should issue a disaster declaration so that businesses can get low-income loans, and require that FERC press its investigation into price gouging and demand refunds not only in California but in the Pacific Northwest, where electricity prices have also skyrocketed.     Republicans continued their opposition to more stringent price caps based on the cost of generation at individual power plants.     ``Having a federal agency try to determine what is a just and reasonable price is laughable,'' said Sen. Fred Thompson of Tennessee, the committee's ranking Republican. Hard price caps ``don't work when supply is the problem. ... They make a bad situation worse,'' he said.     After FERC issued its limited price control order this week, Senate Democrats on Tuesday said they would drop legislation to require more stringent cost-based price caps on Western electricity sales.     Democrats in the House, however, said they would continue to pursue a bill requiring the FERC to take more aggressive action.    =20    =20 ","jeff.dasovich@enron.com, james.steffes@enron.com, richard.shapiro@enron.com,   karen.denne@enron.com, mark.palmer@enron.com,   janel.guerrero@enron.com, paul.kaufman@enron.com,   robert.frank@enron.com, leslie.lawner@enron.com,   susan.landwehr@enron.com, steven.kean@enron.com,   linda.robertson@enron.com",susan.mara@enron.com,"ALERT:  As discussed yesterday, Davis publicly demands nearly $9   billion for electricity overcharges...",2001-06-20 17:03:00-07:00,sent

"Monday, last week, I urged our retail coalition, Alliance for Retail Energy  Markets (AReM), to hold a press conference this week to draw media attention  to the CPUC's vote on Thursday to suspend direct access.  AReM and its PR  Firm agreed.  After a lot of work to line up customers, the press conference  was held Tuesday morning in Scaramento.  We had excellent turnout from customer groups.  Public statements of support  for continuing direct access were made by the California Chamber of Commerce,  CA Manufacturing and Technology Association, CA Large Electric Consumers  Association, CA Retailers Association, School Project for RR (SPURR - forget  the whole acronym but the org purchases gas and electricity for aggregated  elementary and high schools), QUALCOM, City of Palm Springs, NYMEX, and the  ESPs of Green Mountain, New Energy , Enron (me), and Strategic Energy.  All  the major papers were there, San Jose Mercury News, SF Chronicle, LA Times,  SD Union, OC Register, Wall Street Jr.  Also there were the energy trade  press, Bloomberg, Public Radio and a capitol TV station.  All had the  opportunity to ask questions of the customers.  As planned, we let the customers take the limelight.  They made forceful  cases for why the CPUC should not suspend DA and stressed that the  Treasurer's concerns have been addressed in legislation (that has not yet  been acted on) and are actively being negotiated at the Capitol.  They urged  the CPUC not to take this action. I'll forward any media that results from  this  Sue Mara Enron Corp.

"CONFIDENTIAL -- FERC SETTLEMENT DISCUSSIONS  I have proposed quite a few changes and additions to the list.  I also ask  some questions re some of the items listed. I added a section on Retail  Reforms -- we cannot settle with the state unless we settle everything --  otherwise we know the outcome to expect.  regarding your question on hourly day ahead markets -- I assume you're  referring to the energy market that the PX used to run, because the CAISO  already has day-ahead markets for congestion and ancillary services.  I  discussed this proposal with Tim in March because the ISO's filing at FERC  for market reforms had the ISO setting up such a market -- essentially  putting the former PX inside the ISO (and for all you historians, finally  creating the dream of POOLCO for California).  Tim asked us to oppose that  proposal -- his view at the time was that we didn;t want the ISO running  energY markets, because private third parties could do a much better job of  that.  So, we opposed that in our filings commenting on the ISO's proposal in  March.  I'll be in the office Wednesday (Oops! Today).  Can we discuss this list and  where we are headed?

Sunrise is the first major power plant to come on line in California since 1988.  ""We are taking control of our energy destiny,"" Governor Davis said. ""This is the first major power plant built in California since 1988. It's clean, efficient and it was built in record time."" The Sunrise Power Project is jointly owned by Edison Mission Energy and Texaco Power and Gasification. Edison Mission Energy has agreed to sell the power generated at the Sunrise plant to California's Department of Water Resources under a long-term contract at a reasonable rate. By the summer of 2003, the plant is expected to produce 585 megawatts. ""We're building more new power plants than at any other time in our history,"" Governor Davis said. ""Next week, I will be cutting the ribbon on the 500 megawatt Sutter power plant near Yuba City. It will be the largest gas-fired power plant built in California in a generation. Over the next two weeks, we'll be bringing a combined total of more than 1,300 MW on line - enough to power the entire city of San Jose.""  In the 12 years before Governor Davis took office, not a single major power plant was licensed in California. Under Governor Davis' leadership, California has licensed 16 major power plants and 10 ""peaker"" plants. Sunrise is the first of four scheduled to come on line this summer.  The combination of these new power plants, with additional renewables, distributed generation, and re-rates of existing power plants, will bring more than 4,000 new megawatts online by the end of September. At no other time in the history of California have so many new power plants been under construction and in the pipeline. Construction began on the Sunrise Power Project on December 7, 2000, making it operational in a record 6 and a half months. The construction force worked 18 hour days, six days a week, and the plant was brought on 32 days ahead of schedule. Because the plant was completed before July 1, it is eligible for more than $1 million in construction incentive payments under the Governor's Executive Order (D-32).  ""None of this would have been possible without the commitment of Edison Mission Energy, Texaco, and a dedicated construction force,"" Governor Davis said. ""I would like to commend Black and Veatch, ARB and the State Building and Construction Trades Council for moving heaven and earth to bring this project on line ahead of schedule. If not for your Herculean efforts, we would not be here today.""

Published Wednesday, June 27, 2001, in the San Jose Mercury News EDITORIAL  The opinion of the Mercury News PUC should keep consumers plugged in to power choices AT the beginning, the restructured California electricity market was supposed to include competition among sellers of electricity -- offering green power or cheaper power -- not just competition among generators. As things played out, retail competition was nearly smothered. Now, with the state buying electricity on behalf of utilities, it could take a further blow. State officials are leery of letting customers go to other suppliers now that the state will buy huge amounts of electricity over the next decade. The Public Utilities Commission Thursday might suspend ``direct access,'' the ability of consumers large and small to cut their own deals with electricity suppliers, instead of being forced to buy through the state/utilities. The PUC should leave it alone. Instead, the Legislature should continue discussing ways of revitalizing direct access without leaving the state with long-term contracts and not enough customers. Ultimately, the state should get out of the electricity business. Keeping retail competition alive is one avenue of escape.  ******************************************************** There's a slightly negative zinger at the very end, but overall a balanced story. Published Wednesday, June 27, 2001, in the San Jose Mercury News CALIFORNIA'S ENERGY CRISIS PUC likely to call a halt to shopping for power BY MICHAEL BAZELEY <mailto:mbazeley@sjmercury.com>  AND JOHN WOOLFOLK <mailto:jwoolfolk@sjmercury.com> Mercury News State regulators Thursday are expected to pull the plug on electricity deregulation's core feature: the ability of customers to shop around for alternative power. After July 1, residential and business customers would no longer be allowed to shop for a new electricity provider under a measure expected to be approved by the California Public Utilities Commission. State leaders fear that after stepping in and buying premium-priced power to avoid blackouts this year, big businesses will flee for a better deal, sticking small consumers with the government's energy bill. Those consumers would then face higher rates, causing even more to flee. ``You create a death spiral,'' said Sen. Debra Bowen, D-Redondo Beach. Business leaders, alternative energy providers and some state officials are desperately trying to head off the move, saying they've saved a bundle on energy through the ``direct access'' option of bypassing the major utilities. ``While we're coping with the rate increase, we think direct access is the best way for us to manage the cost of energy,'' said Dominic DiMare, legislative advocate of the California Chamber of Commerce. ``It leads to market discipline as well as innovation,'' DiMare said. Supporters argue the state, which approved a record $13.4 billion in bonds to cover power costs, can guarantee payment without killing off customer choice. They backed an alternative proposal Tuesday by utilities Commissioner Richard Bilas in which customers would pay a charge to cover the state's energy bonds, regardless of their electricity provider. Customers already pay similar charges to cover an array of costs from nuclear decommissioning to conservation programs. ``It still gives people the opportunity to buy energy that might not necessarily be cheaper, but that meets their needs more,'' said Rick Counihan, spokesman for Green Mountain Energy, which markets power from renewable sources such as solar and wind. But even Bilas gives his proposal long odds of approval, saying ``If I were a betting man'' he'd say his plan ``would go down.'' The ability to shop for power was the impetus for the state's 1996 deregulation bill. The architects of deregulation -- led by business groups -- believed that if customers could buy power directly from producers, it would promote competition and drive down prices. It never happened. Wholesale power costs soared, and that, along with a host of other issues, drove companies out of the state, forcing tens of thousands of consumers back into the arms of utilities. Now, though, with significantly higher electric rates going into effect this month, choice is looking more attractive than ever to big businesses. Joined by alternative power companies, they are trying to push a bill through the Legislature that would set up a framework for continued choice. ``Manufacturers live and die by the ability to cut costs,'' said Gino DiCaro, spokesman for the California Manufacturers and Technology Association. ``If they have an opportunity to save money, we don't feel there's any reason that should be taken away.'' That type of freedom raises a host of thorny issues. The state is now buying power on behalf of utilities and entering into dozens of long-term power contracts. If businesses and residential users flee the system, the state could be left with a surplus of costly power and fewer users to pay for it. That, in turn, could mean higher rates for the remaining users. Bowen is trying to address these issues in a bill that would make customers pay when they leave the system. Her bill also would allow users to go into the market only during annual enrollment periods, and it would limit the amount of power that could be bought on the open market. Business groups are fighting those provisions.  Contact Michael Bazeley at mbazeley@sjmercury.com <mailto:mbazeley@sjmercury.com> or (415) 434-1018.

This article gives Pat Wood of FERC's position supporting direct access in California.  Edelman worked with Bernadette Tansey on this article  and provided her with information on AReM and the DA coalition's goals, as well as background on direct access.  We are also currently working with the Chronicle's Editorial board to secure an editorial  ****************************************  Bush appointee warns state PUC on 'direct access'  FERC panelist wants consumers to retain choice of energy firms  Zachary Coile, Bernadette Tansey, Chronicle Staff Writers Thursday, June 28, 2001  ,2001 San Francisco Chronicle   URL: http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2001/06/28/MN207167.DTL    Washington -- President Bush's key federal energy regulator warned California that it may hurt consumers if the state approves a proposal to bar power users from shopping around for the best prices for electricity.   Patrick Wood, a member of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and Bush's liaison to the state on energy issues, criticized a plan before the California Public Utilities Commission to suspend a major element of the state's 1996 deregulation plan.   Called ""direct access,"" the program allows businesses to cut deals with private power suppliers and permits consumers to choose among competing electricity providers, including firms that market renewable sources of energy.   Members of the state PUC, which had been set to consider the issue today, said yesterday that they will delay the vote on direct access until Tuesday at the urging of Assembly Speaker Bob Hertzberg, D-Sherman Oaks.   Wood, who met with state PUC chairwoman Loretta Lynch during a two-day trip to California earlier this week, said he fears that ending direct access will lock consumers into higher energy prices.   ""I do worry about the future of retail competition,"" he said yesterday in Washington. ""I think a lot of things they're trying to do to resolve today's problem may really push off the benefits of direct access for quite a few years. I'm really concerned about that.""   At the same time, Wood stressed that the federal regulators would not try to override the commission's and Legislature's decision. ""It's their call. It's a state prerogative,"" he said.   The state PUC is expected to suspend direct access Tuesday because the state needs all energy users -- especially big industrial consumers -- to stay on as utility customers and help pay off the $8 billion the state has already spent on energy, and $43 billion more worth of power bought through long-term contracts.   Lynch said the PUC must act soon because state Treasurer Phil Angelides has warned that allowing direct access to continue without restrictions would threaten the state's ability to sell $12.5 billion in bonds to pay for the power purchases.   If some customers are allowed to desert the utilities and buy power from competitors, fewer ratepayers would be left to pay off the bonds. And the remaining utility customers would be stuck covering the huge costs racked up during the energy crisis.   ""We need to be sure the bonds are issued,"" Lynch said.   Even though direct access has been allowed since 1996, few businesses or householders actually did it. At its peak, the program drew about 224,000 households -- about 2.5 percent of the customer base of California's major utilities. About 13 percent of the industrial market contracted for their own power.   When the state took over buying power for the cash-strapped utilities in January, the Legislature directed the PUC to suspend the direct access program.    LAST CHANCE FOR DIRECT ACCESS Still, Hertzberg asked Lynch to delay the PUC's vote on direct access until next week so legislators who back the program can try to save it in a deal that would still provide a steady stream of revenue for the bonds.   ""We're looking at options as a last-ditch effort,"" Hertzberg said. ""If the PUC had made the decision to suspend direct access, that would have had a chilling effect on anything we want to do.""   Wood, a champion of energy deregulation, said he believes that California should not abandon its effort to increase competition by allowing customers more choices about where they get their power.   ""Deregulation always benefits people,"" he said. ""If it doesn't, you've got to rework it until it does.""    WARNING FROM CHAIRMAN-TO-BE Wood, a soft-spoken Texan who is expected to become the regulatory commission chairman this fall, praised California leaders for their efforts to address the crisis, including getting new plants built quickly. But in meetings this week, he cautioned Gov. Gray Davis and other state leaders against trying to punish the generators for alleged past wrongs.   ""I think the rhetoric is still pretty hot out there,"" he said. ""If I were a generator looking at 50 states, talking about a windfall profits tax and expropriation of property. . . . it's not a great climate"" for investing in new plants.

As for the effective date, I wrote to Ann Watson and Linda Serizawa pointing out that a retroactive suspension of DA would be extremely problematical to ESPs and probably cause complaints to be filed by customers who had signed in good faith.  It was then suggested that the effective date should be subsequent to whatever date a decision is issued.  Watson responded indicating agreement but pointing out that it was Wood, not Bilas, who was suspending DA and that Serizawa needed to respond.  Serizawa's only response was to remind me that the email was an ex parte contact and needed to be filed, which I already knew, of course.  However, she did not respond on the issue (why am I not surprised?).  By the way, the memo you discuss in your email was not attached to the version I received.  Dan  Law Offices of Daniel W.

"Thanks, Sue.  FYI--this new schedule was discussed a lot last week, and  apparently was a big part of the meeting that occured with Davis' people and  Angelides last Thursday nite.  It was a move to buy time to try and get a  comprehensive settlement in place in the legislature (i.e., core/noncore).   In addition to buying time to save Direct Access, it also gives Angelides  more time to get the bonds lined up, which seems to be an increasingly  challenging task---there's growing speculation that the issuance will be much  more difficult than Angelides has thus far let on.   That said, I need to check around, but there is some chance that the  plan/agreement is that the PUC decisions would go out well in advance of  August (with effective date being August), which would then provide enough  time to let the expedited ""appeals process"" under (SB37?) run its course in  time for the issuance in Sept/Oct.  In short, we'll need to remain vigilant  energized because there's a chance that the decisions to which Angelides  refers in the memo could be up at the Commission sooner rather than later.   This is what I was hearing last Friday, but perhaps things have changed and  now there's more time.   I'll check and report back.  Finally, simultaneous with those actions, folks are supposed to be putting  the core/noncore agreement into legislative language.  I'll report back as  soon as I have more information on that.

I've read the respective Burton and Hertzberg language on amending AB 1X.   The Burton language looks cleaner and simpler, though there may be reasons to  include some of the Hertzberg language, too.  I'm proposing to the group the following as potential amendments to the bond  bill.  I would appreciate your feedback.  The amendments would be as follows:  Customers who were on Direct Access when DWR started buying power (Jan.  17th?), and are still on Direct Access when the bill passes, should be exempt  from paying for the bonds.   In short, customers should not be forced to pay for power twice--once from  their ESP, and once from DWR.  Since these customers receive power services  from their ESP, they never consumed DWR power in the first place and it  wouldn't be fair to require them to pay for it.  Customers who have been utility customers since DWR started buying power but  subsequently switched to Direct Access should only pay for power provided by  DWR that they actually consumed, no more and no less.    For example, if a customer was a utility customer when DWR started buying  power but switched to Direct Access on May 1st, then the customer would only  be responsible for reimbursing DWR for power deliveries that took place from  Jan. 17th thru April 30th.  I believe that we agreed on these concepts during the negotiations that took  place over the past 4-5 weeks.  Or if we didn't explicitly agree during the  talks, they seem to be principles on which we ought to be able to agree  pretty easily now. And rather than leave the issue hanging, which can create  unnecessary and costly uncertainty for customers, I suggest that we include  very clear and simple legislative language in the bond bill clarifying what  customers' obligations are.  Your thoughts are appreciated.  In addition, we have talked quite a bit about providing customers with  incentives in the attempt to get California out of the energy hole that it  finds itself in.  Providing (20KW and above) customers with an incentive to  switch to Direct Access as soon as possible could 1) reduce the net short  position that the state (and ultimately consumers) have to finance, thereby  reducing spot purchases and price volatility,  2) reduce electricity  purchasing costs, and 3) reduce the burden on the state budget.  With this in mind, I'm also proposing that the group consider an amendment to  the bond bill that would exempt from bond charges any customer that switches  to Direct Access by September 1st.  Finally, it seems odd that the language directing the PUC to suspend Direct  Access is still in the bill.  If a dedicated rate component is created, that  seems to eliminate altogether the need to suspend Direct Access.  And if  that's the case, would it make sense to delete that language from the bill?

I've read the respective Burton and Hertzberg language on amending AB 1X.  The Burton language looks cleaner and simpler, though there may be reasons to include some of the Hertzberg language, too.  I'm proposing to the group the following as potential amendments to the bond bill.  I would appreciate your feedback.  The amendments would be as follows:  Customers who were on Direct Access when DWR started buying power (Jan. 17th?), and are still on Direct Access when the bill passes, should be exempt from paying for the bonds.   In short, customers should not be forced to pay for power twice--once from their ESP, and once from DWR.  Since these customers receive power services from their ESP, they never consumed DWR power in the first place and it wouldn't be fair to require them to pay for it.  Customers who have been utility customers since DWR started buying power but subsequently switched to Direct Access should only pay for power provided by DWR that they actually consumed, no more and no less.    For example, if a customer was a utility customer when DWR started buying power but switched to Direct Access on May 1st, then the customer would only be responsible for reimbursing DWR for power deliveries that took place from Jan. 17th thru April 30th.  I believe that we agreed on these concepts during the negotiations that took place over the past 4-5 weeks.  Or if we didn't explicitly agree during the talks, they seem to be principles on which we ought to be able to agree pretty easily now. And rather than leave the issue hanging, which can create unnecessary and costly uncertainty for customers, I suggest that we include very clear and simple legislative language in the bond bill clarifying what customers' obligations are.  Your thoughts are appreciated.  In addition, we have talked quite a bit about providing customers with incentives in the attempt to get California out of the energy hole that it finds itself in.  Providing (20KW and above) customers with an incentive to switch to Direct Access as soon as possible could 1) reduce the net short position that the state (and ultimately consumers) have to finance, thereby reducing spot purchases and price volatility,  2) reduce electricity purchasing costs, and 3) reduce the burden on the state budget.  With this in mind, I'm also proposing that the group consider an amendment to the bond bill that would exempt from bond charges any customer that switches to Direct Access by September 1st.  Finally, it seems odd that the language directing the PUC to suspend Direct Access is still in the bill.  If a dedicated rate component is created, that seems to eliminate altogether the need to suspend Direct Access.  And if that's the case, would it make sense to delete that language from the bill?

"Duke Energy Asked to Allow Release of Data Power: Senator says the generator is refusing to make public some information  crucial to the price-gouging probe. Firm says it's complying. CARL INGRAM TIMES STAFF WRITER  July 10 2001  SACRAMENTO -- The chairman of a Senate committee probing suspected price  gouging during the California energy crisis charged Monday that Duke Energy  is refusing to allow him to make public information key to his investigation.  Sen. Joe Dunn (D-Santa Ana) said Duke has made the price bidding information  from its Chula Vista plant available to committee members and staffers. But  under a federal confidentiality rule, the data cannot be made public without  Duke's consent.  The documents concern the Chula Vista plant, which former employees have  alleged was ramped up and down to drive up power prices during three days in  January. However, state records show that the agency overseeing the  electricity grid ordered those gyrations to keep the power flowing throughout  the state. Dunn said Duke's refusal thwarts the committee's investigation and  efforts to enact possible remedial legislation because the confidential  information cannot be shared with others in the Legislature or the public.  Dunn said Duke cited a rule of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission that  gives the company the authority to decide which records it makes public and  which stay secret.  ""The only one who can release the data is Duke. We agreed to be bound by what  is provided in the FERC tariff, nothing more or less,"" he said.  Former Employees Tell of Maneuvers  Dunn noted that the committee is considering trying to obtain the information  elsewhere and ""release it over Duke's objections.""  Three former workers at the Duke plant near Chula Vista testified last month  under oath that the plant, among other things, was ramped up and down in what  seemed to be an effort to maximize revenue during the Jan. 16-18 emergency.  But Duke countered immediately that it had merely obeyed orders of the  California Independent System Operator, which keeps the state's electricity  grid in balance. Duke later provided Cal-ISO documents backing up its  explanation.  Duke executives insisted that the former employees failed to provide a full  picture of the plant's operation during the three days.  But Dunn, chairman of the select Senate committee on alleged price gouging,  said Monday that by refusing to authorize release of all the subpoenaed data,  Duke was guilty of the same tactics.  ""Duke is trying to draw the impression that it has [provided] the full  picture. But they are fully aware that we cannot draw any final conclusions  until all that data has been released. That hasn't occurred,"" Dunn said.  To make a determination whether the Chula Vista power was withheld to drive  up prices, Dunn said, the committee must publicly examine ""the bids Duke  submitted from which the ISO issued orders to the plant."" They include the  expensive hour-ahead and day-ahead markets, he said.  Duke, a North Carolina-based wholesaler that operates several plants in  California, noted that it considers the information proprietary and  off-limits to legislators not on the committee.  Duke spokesman Tom Williams insisted that the generator is attempting to  comply with the committee's demands. But he was unable to say whether Duke  would agree to make the bidding documents public along with other records the  committee plans to turn over.  ""We are complying now,"" Williams said. ""There is some suggestion that we are  leaving stuff out when we have not had a chance to testify. . . . I don't  know what we are ultimately going to do.""  The committee had threatened to cite eight wholesale generators unless they  provide pricing and bidding documents by Wednesday. Six, including Duke, have  said they would comply to avoid a contempt citation. Two, Enron and Mirant,  were cited.  Dunn said the committee on Wednesday likely will give companies that are  trying to comply an extra week to do so, but others probably will be formally  charged with contempt in a report to the full Senate. The upper house is the  final arbiter of such issues.  Although there is scant precedent for levying penalties against those cited  for contempt, Dunn said he favors imposing severe fines. In 1929, the most  recent case, a cement company executive was sent to jail.  Copyright 2001, Los Angeles Times   Sue Mara Enron Corp.

" Duke Energy Asked to Allow Release of Data Power: Senator says the generator is refusing to make public some information crucial to the price-gouging probe. Firm says it's complying. CARL INGRAM TIMES STAFF WRITER  July 10 2001  SACRAMENTO -- The chairman of a Senate committee probing suspected price gouging during the California energy crisis charged Monday that Duke Energy is refusing to allow him to make public information key to his investigation.  Sen. Joe Dunn (D-Santa Ana) said Duke has made the price bidding information from its Chula Vista plant available to committee members and staffers. But under a federal confidentiality rule, the data cannot be made public without Duke's consent.  The documents concern the Chula Vista plant, which former employees have alleged was ramped up and down to drive up power prices during three days in January. However, state records show that the agency overseeing the electricity grid ordered those gyrations to keep the power flowing throughout the state. Dunn said Duke's refusal thwarts the committee's investigation and efforts to enact possible remedial legislation because the confidential information cannot be shared with others in the Legislature or the public.  Dunn said Duke cited a rule of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission that gives the company the authority to decide which records it makes public and which stay secret.  ""The only one who can release the data is Duke. We agreed to be bound by what is provided in the FERC tariff, nothing more or less,"" he said.  Former Employees Tell of Maneuvers  Dunn noted that the committee is considering trying to obtain the information elsewhere and ""release it over Duke's objections.""  Three former workers at the Duke plant near Chula Vista testified last month under oath that the plant, among other things, was ramped up and down in what seemed to be an effort to maximize revenue during the Jan. 16-18 emergency.  But Duke countered immediately that it had merely obeyed orders of the California Independent System Operator, which keeps the state's electricity grid in balance. Duke later provided Cal-ISO documents backing up its explanation.  Duke executives insisted that the former employees failed to provide a full picture of the plant's operation during the three days.  But Dunn, chairman of the select Senate committee on alleged price gouging, said Monday that by refusing to authorize release of all the subpoenaed data, Duke was guilty of the same tactics.  ""Duke is trying to draw the impression that it has [provided] the full picture. But they are fully aware that we cannot draw any final conclusions until all that data has been released. That hasn't occurred,"" Dunn said.  To make a determination whether the Chula Vista power was withheld to drive up prices, Dunn said, the committee must publicly examine ""the bids Duke submitted from which the ISO issued orders to the plant."" They include the expensive hour-ahead and day-ahead markets, he said.  Duke, a North Carolina-based wholesaler that operates several plants in California, noted that it considers the information proprietary and off-limits to legislators not on the committee.  Duke spokesman Tom Williams insisted that the generator is attempting to comply with the committee's demands. But he was unable to say whether Duke would agree to make the bidding documents public along with other records the committee plans to turn over.  ""We are complying now,"" Williams said. ""There is some suggestion that we are leaving stuff out when we have not had a chance to testify. . . . I don't know what we are ultimately going to do.""  The committee had threatened to cite eight wholesale generators unless they provide pricing and bidding documents by Wednesday. Six, including Duke, have said they would comply to avoid a contempt citation. Two, Enron and Mirant, were cited.  Dunn said the committee on Wednesday likely will give companies that are trying to comply an extra week to do so, but others probably will be formally charged with contempt in a report to the full Senate. The upper house is the final arbiter of such issues.  Although there is scant precedent for levying penalties against those cited for contempt, Dunn said he favors imposing severe fines. In 1929, the most recent case, a cement company executive was sent to jail.  Copyright 2001, Los Angeles Times    Sue Mara Enron Corp.

The utilities request that, on an expedited basis, the Commission limit the scope of the PX Credit audit which WPTF obtained in a negotiated settlement in the 1998 RAP proceeding to remaining year 2000 calculations and thereafter order that the audit be terminated.  They state that the audit is both irrelevant and costly and that ""common sense demands"" the Commission reconsider the decision.  They ask that comments in opposition be filed by August 3, reply comments on August 10 and a Commission decision at its meeting scheduled for August 23. They also ask the Commission to waive the period provided in Rule 77.7 for comments and reply comments on a draft decision in order that the decision become final immediately.  The filing states that there have been dramatic changes in energy markets, the number of DA customers has declined significantly and that ratepayers should not have to pay for the audit.  Of course, they don't mention that the reason for the decline in DA customers is their own failure to pay the PX Credit.  It is instead attributed to the ""dysfunctional restructuring scheme and concommitant rise in wholesale energy prices.""  They justify their request legally by stating that their filing demonstrates that there are ""significant new facts"" and a ""material change in conditions.""  The third criteria for reopening or modifying a Commission decision, a basic misconception of law or fact by the Commission, is not alleged to have occurred.  They also state that DA penetration will continue to decline because ""Assembly Bills X1-1 and X1-6 have effectively reregulated the market.""  Attached to the filing are declarations from the three ESP members of the Audit Committee, Bob Anderson of APSES,  Aaron Thomas of AES NewEnergy and Marilynn Semro of Seattle City Light Department, in support of the utilities' petition.  I have not reviewed the specific wording changes to the RAP decision to determine if there are any problems with the proposed modifications.  Dan  Law Offices of Daniel W.

He is so desperate to find villains with whom he can deflect focus from his own record that he continues to ignore facts. Here is my effort to set the record straight on several of the Governor's, and his lackeys, recent  pronouncements on energy and the budget.  Energy: MYTH:  ""All Texans are evil"" His spokesman said, ""Anywhere they wear cowboy hats, they probably have handkerchiefs across their face because they are robbing us blind.""  Why he said it: George Bush is from Texas and is a convenient scapegoat. FACT: Only 2 of the 12 largest energy suppliers to California are from Texas and they provide only 9% of the state's energy use.    MYTH:  ""Private power generators charged California the most"" Governor Davis said, ""What's going on here, pure and simple, is unconscionable price-gouging by the big energy producers."" Why he said it: Polls show that it is easier to blame power generators for the energy crisis than anyone else. FACT: The private company power generators charged substantially lower prices over the last few months for energy than the public agencies.  In fact, documents recently released reveal that Enron and Mirant averaged $181 and $225 per megawatt while LADWP and Sacramento Municipal averaged $292 and $330 for energy sold to the state during the first quarter of this year.    MYTH:  ""Power companies manipulated prices""  Governor Davis said,  ""Their testimony could be the ""smoking gun"" that demonstrates there was improper manipulation of California's electricity market.""   Why he said it: another way to say, ""its not my fault, its their fault"" FACT: Duke energy shut its plant down because it was ordered to, in order to balance the grid, by the California ISO, an entity overseen entirely by Davis appointees.  Budget: MYTH:  ""Republicans want to cut education spending"" A lead education appointee said, ""We feel very strongly that agreeing to that would put us in a position where children would lose."" Why it was said: he needs to think of something to justify his tax increase. FACT: Republicans have never proposed cuts in education out of the current budget. We have instead proposed reducing pork, entirely new or expanded  programs, and cutting funded but vacant bureaucratic positions.   MYTH:  ""The $1.2 billion sales tax increase is not a tax increase"" The Governor said, ""They've just invented this argument about a tax increase. It's just nonsense. It's not a tax increase.""  Why he said it: he wants to maintain the illusion of being a fiscal conservative FACT: One year ago, when the sales tax was cut, Davis had a news conference announcing ""This tax decrease will benefit every Californian.  It will put even more of our prosperity in the hands of those who created it in the first place - the taxpayers of this State."" Now, when the same tax goes up, it is not a tax increase?

For those who have inquired, IEP will be identified as ""Opposed, unless amended"" in the committee analysis if the analysis lists support and opposition.  However, committee staff is considering not listing support or opposition in the analysis because of the limited timeframe that companies had to put in a letter.       -----Original Message----- From: Jan Smutny-Jones [mailto:smutny@iepa.com] Sent: Friday, July 13, 2001 3:35 PM To: 'Alex Sugaoka (E-mail)'; 'Bill Woods (E-mail)'; 'Bob Ellery (E-mail)'; 'Bob Escalante (E-mail)'; 'Bob Gates (E-mail)'; 'Carolyn A Baker (E-mail)'; Charles Linthicum (E-mail); 'Cody Carter (E-mail)'; 'Curt Hatton (E-mail)'; 'Curtis Kebler (E-mail)'; 'David Parquet'; 'Dean Gosselin (E-mail)'; 'Douglas Kerner (E-mail)'; 'Duane Nelsen (E-mail)'; 'Ed Tomeo (E-mail)'; 'Eileen Koch (E-mail)'; 'Eric Eisenman (E-mail)'; 'Frank DeRosa (E-mail)'; 'Greg Blue (E-mail)'; 'Hap Boyd (E-mail)'; 'Hawks Jack (E-mail)'; 'Jack Pigott (E-mail)'; 'Jim Willey (E-mail)'; 'Joe Greco (E-mail)'; 'Joe Ronan (E-mail)'; 'John Stout (E-mail)'; 'Jonathan Weisgall (E-mail)'; Kate Castillo (E-mail); 'Kelly Lloyd (E-mail)'; 'Ken Hoffman (E-mail)'; 'Kent Fickett (E-mail)'; 'Kent Palmerton'; 'Lynn Lednicky (E-mail)'; Mark Fillinger (E-mail); Marty McFadden (E-mail); Paul Desrochers (E-mail); Paula Soos (E-mail); 'Randy Hickok (E-mail)'; 'Roger Pelote (E-mail)'; 'Ross Ain (E-mail)'; Scott Sadler (E-mail); 'Stephanie Newell (E-mail)'; Steve Iliff (E-mail); 'Steve Ponder (E-mail)'; 'Susan J Mara (E-mail)'; Thomas R.

Prior to  June they appeared to be using a market based price for power, but in June  the credit dropped to about $40/MWh which looks like utility-owned gen.  We want to make sure we are not missing a utility-levied charge in our  forward curves ( e.g. CTC charge that will be applied to DA) so we're trying  to verify the utilities' method of calculating PX credits.  I talked to the PG&E accounting person who said that their Regulatory group  has sent Enron's regulatory group information on the way the PX Credit is  calculated.  Can someone locate this information and forward it to me as soon  as possible?  Given that our customers are all switching to DA we don't want  to discover there's a charge we don't know about.

However, now that it is moving they have got the message.  Williams (Kern River) is going to host a meeting today to create a coalition to oppose the bill.  Bev Hansen knows where the meeting will take place.  In addition to Williams, I understand that Questar, WSPA, and other retail customer groups will join the coalition and oppose the bill.  My client Wild Goose will also be listed in opposition, but they don't carry that much clout or name recognition so far.  I am hopeful that other groups will surface soon.  As for the bill itself, the problem is two fold.  First, the CPUC decides what infrastructure to build at the request of the utilities.  They take input from customers, but Loretta is a command and control type all the way, and she will try to scare away private capital investment by interstate pipelines by mandating that the utilities build a gold-plated state-regulated system.  While the bill does not (and cannot legally) bar interstate pipelines from coming into the state, it has provisions which will prevent large customers from signing up with the interstates.  The large customers have to commit to take firm service on a 5 year basis with exit fees.  If they don't take this, they can only get interruptible service from the utilities.  Many if not all large customers, especially generators cannot afford to take partial service from an interstate and have only interruptible access to the LDC system.  This is the same dilemma that the RLS tariff caused.  My belief is that the obligation on the part of the commission to provide the utilities with cost recovery for the new investments will be used as justification by the utilities for another attempt to reinstitute the RLS tariff or an onerous peaking rate.  The Commission will impose a premium price on service to customers who have not undertaken the firm 5 year commitment and will therefore be unable to economically take partial requirements service from an interstate.  My view is based on Sempra's reaction to the current peaking rate proposed decision and statements by Lynch's office.  This could interfere with Enron gas sales over the interstates, and would certainly threaten any Transwestern plans for building across the border into California, although that does not appear to be a high priority at this time.  This bill will also make it more costly to develop gas supply arrangments for new power plants which had hoped to direct connect to interstate pipeline capacity for a portion of their needs.  Please call if you have further questions.

Few questions.  Mike,    I understand from our conversation yesterday that your following this on    behalf of Questar.  Do we know if the other pipelines have been active    in any discussions on this bill?    What about the generators?  Have then been involved, since presumably,    their in need of lots more capacity (and they're referenced in the    bill)?    What about large customers?  They been screaming for more    infrastructure, too, and many have blamed SoCalGas (and the PUC) for not    delivering it.    Do we know if pipelines, generators, large customers are supporting or    opposing the bill?  I'll try to check around, too, in between the    electric mayhem.    There doesn't seem to be anything in the bill that prevents the    interstates from building into the state.    If that's true, wouldn't the PUC take those projects into account when    doing its analysis and only require the utility to construct (and    noncore to take) capacity that isn't already being met by others (i.e.,    interstates) bringing pipe into the state?  Any info you can provide on these fronts would be very useful.  Don't want Enron too far out in front of opposition until we find out a bit more regarding 1) whose fer and agin it and 2) analysis of what the bill actually does/does not do.

Headlining the Conference as Keynote Speakers are two of the five Federal Energy Regulatory Commissioners (FERC).  Commissioner Nora Brownell will keynote the Thursday, August 2 session and Commissioner Bill Massey will open the Friday session.  Commissioner Nora Brownell was nominated by President George W. Bush to serve on the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) on April 30, 2001 and was confirmed by the U.S. Senate on May 25.  Prior to joining the Commission, Ms. Brownell served as a member of the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission (PUC).  During her tenure at the PUC, Ms. Brownell took an active role in the roll out of electric choice in Pennsylvania.  In addition to her work in establishing the framework for  one of the most successful retail electric markets in the country, Ms. Brownell was a leader in the administration of Pennsylvania's Electric Choice Consumer Education Program.  William L. Massey was nominated by President Clinton and was confirmed by the Senate in 1993.  He was renominated and confirmed for a second five-year term ending June 30, 2003.  Commissioner Massey was the only Clinton-appointed FERC commissioner to support Governor Davis' demand for electricity price controls in the western states earlier this year.  The CMTA energy Conference agenda will include the latest information on  energy legislation making its way through the state capitol, an update of pending CPUC decisions as well as a review of the various financial proposals aimed at returning Edison and PG&E creditworthiness and restoring direct access to California's electricity consumers.  We have scheduled panels of government and industry experts to discuss Natural Gas Prices, Supply and Infrastructure; Managing High Prices and Blackouts; Environmental Impacts and Trade-Offs; and two panel discussions on present and future energy markets.

"In case you didn't see it 7/16/01 -- Palmer quoted Senate power play jolts Enron  'The whole thing stinks to high heaven."" That  was the assessment Adrian Moore, executive director of Reason Public Policy  Institute, gave of a state Senate committee's recent move to hold Enron Corp.  in contempt for refusing to hand over subpoenaed documents.  We're inclined  to agree. The Texas-based energy merchant has filed a countersuit in  Sacramento Superior Court, arguing that the Senate has no right to wield  influence beyond state borders and that putting the documents into public  view ""jeopardized confidential business information,"" the Register reported  Thursday.  The court should order the Senate either to make its document  request more specific or to drop the contempt charge and subpoena altogether.  Robert Levy, a constitutional law expert at the Cato Institute, told us that  Enron's point about disclosing confidential information will be its strongest  argument in court.  While Enron can't hide behind state borders, Levy says  the Senate's request is not tailored narrowly enough to ensure information  that could damage Enron's market viability is not released. He said the  Senate should have to let a judge decide whether releasing the documents is  necessary for its investigation and avoids unfairly harming Enron.  Instead,  the full Senate just has to approve the committee's recommendation for  Enron's executives to become criminals. ""It seems to me that's a scary  proposition,"" Levy said. ""Why should the Senate have such plenary power?""  Good question.  Moore told us it's because the energy crisis has created an  ""all-bets-are-off"" situation in Sacramento, where anything goes so long as  it's attacking the energy companies. Because Enron is just a merchant, not a  producer, of energy, it couldn't have had much at all to do with manipulating  the market. ""It's impossible,"" Enron spokesman Mark Palmer told us Friday.  ""We don't have anything to withhold.  We don't have an interest in high  prices in California. We're just interested in a marketplace that works.""  Added Moore, ""It's pretty hard to spin a realistic scenario where they  (Enron) engaged in gouging.""

A copy of the final resolution, which has several changes from  t= he=20 draft issued a few weeks ago, is attached for your information.? The =20 Resolution explicitly states that DA customers are exempt from the AB 265= =20 rate  surcharge, as AReM advocated in its July 9 comments.?

Some of the implementation issues raised by SDG&E= =20 require  clarifications as discussed in the remainder of this section. . . = .=20 . . . =20  ?SDG&E next maintains that the draft  Resolution resolves two issues that= =20 instead should be resolved in A.00-10-045  and A.01-01-044:? changes in the=  =20 definition of =01&small=018 customers and the treatment of DA customers.? (= We note=20 that the Commission has not  publicly issued a Proposed Decision or draft= =20 Alternate Decision in those  proceedings addressing the treatment of DA=20 customers or the definition of small  customers.) . . . . .=20  With respect to the treatment of DA customers we see no  reason why it is= =20 improper to address that issue here, as that issue has been  addressed by t= he=20 participants in this informal proceeding.? Accordingly, we determine that D= A =20 customers are exempt from recovery of the undercollection that results from= =20 the  AB 265 energy price ceiling based only on the record established for= =20 this  Resolution.? That is we base this  determination on relevant=20 information contained in protests and responses to  protests on the advice= =20 letters addressed by this Resolution and comments and  reply comments on=20 drafts of this Resolution that were circulated for public  comment . . . . = .=20 . . .?  ?SDG&E also asserts in its July 9, 2001 comments  that the draft Resolution= =20 finds DA Issues moot but addresses them anyway.?? SDG&E also argues that it=  =20 withdrew AL 1264-E and that the draft Resolution inappropriately addressed= =20 two  issues:? exempting DA customers from  any future cost recovery=20 obligations associated with AB 265 rate ceiling  benefits, and determining= =20 what the obligations are of DA customers who return to  utility bundled=20 service.? SDG&E  also maintains that the Resolution must be revised to avoi= d=20 gaming by customers  who attempt to avoid paying their share of the=20 undercollection.  We first note that the draft Resolution clearly noted at page  6 the=20 continued relevance of DA issues despite SDG&E=01,s withdrawal of AL  1264-= E.?=20  The passage of Assembly 1X 1 and the potential for the  Commission to suspe= nd=20 Direct Access reduce the potential for gaming.? With no individual tracking= , =20 miss-matches between benefits and repayment obligations are inevitable.?=20 Limiting rate ceiling cost recovery  responsibility to bundled service=20 customers is an expedient way to mitigate such  mismatches and is supported= =20 in the discussion section of the resolution by the  ADJ's intent to not=20 discriminate against DA customers.?=20  SDG&E states in its July 9 comments that the draft  Resolution? must be=20 changed to  clearly state that customers cannot avoid paying for costs simp= ly=20 by switching  back and forth between bundled service and DA, and that the= =20 only customers who  will avoid paying for costs are those who never caused= =20 them to be incurred in  the first place.? But the reverse  could also be=20 true.? Some DA  customers that were returned to bundled service in early=20 2001, not having  received the largest part of the rate ceiling benefit,=20 might have the same  repayment obligations as bundled SDG&E customers that= =20 received the benefit  back to June 2001, as well as those that just move in= to=20 SDG&E service  territory when the benefit ends and the repayment begins.?? = We=20 do not address these issues in  this Resolution.? In the Resolution, we=20 determined that the complexity of individual  tracking at this point is=20 likely to outweigh its benefits. . . . . . . =20  ARM, in its comments on the re-circulated resolution, supports the order = =20 that DA customers should not be liable for any SDG&E undercollection =20 balancing account.? However, ARM  proposes a single change to the draft=20 Resolution, regarding the treatment of  customers who spend some time on, a= nd=20 sometime off, direct access (DA), and who  find themselves, for whatever=20 reason, off DA when SDG&E recovers  under-collections arising from AB265.? = =20 If the Commission is unwilling to require individual customer tracking,  an= d=20 if these customers are for whatever reason off DA when SDG&E assesses =20 under-collection obligations arising from AB265, the Commission should trea= t =20 them as DA customers.?=20  We will not adopt ARM's proposal on this record.? Customers in the position= =20 described by  ARM would have at least received a portion of the rate ceilin= g=20 benefits and are  not differently situated from new customers in the SDG&E= =20 service  territory.???=20  ARM argues that a DA customer who has not received the  benefit of the rate= =20 cap has not contributed to the utility=01,s purchased power  undercollectio= n.?=20 If that customer  later finds herself, for whatever reason, on bundled=20 service and subject to the  AB265 rate cap, she should be liable for her=20 share of undercollections incurred  during the period when she was on bundl= ed=20 service.? But since SDG&E contends that it  cannot support individual=20 tracking, ARM proposes that customers that were DA  during the period since= =20 June 2000 be exempt from the repayment obligations.?=20  As further support, ARM also cites the ACR issued on July 2,  in A.00-11-03= 8,=20 seeking comments by July 10 on a =01&proposed settlement of pending  litiga= tion=018=20 between the Commission and SDG&E.?

This entire week has been focused on devising a ""solution"" for the energy crisis in addition to negotiating the passage of the state budget. Although the Democratic leadership of the Assembly and the Governor successfully lobbied four Assembly Republican lawmakers to switch sides and vote for the budget on Monday, the four Republicans have refused to vote for five crucial ""trailer"" bills which are necessary to implement the budget bill. There are approximately 18 trailer bills that must be passed in addition to the budget bill, but 5 have raised concerns for the Republicans:  SB 767 Transportation Funding Shift, SB 735 Elimination of School Facility Fee Housing Programs, SB 1041 Omnibus Health Trailer Bill,  AB 144 Public Social Services and SB 79 Omnibus Social Services Trailer bill.  Senate President pro Tempore John Burton has stated that they will not vote on the budget bill in the Senate until the trailer bills are approved by the Assembly.  As of 7:00 p.m. tonight, there is no budget deal.  Meanwhile, on the energy front, the four proposals we have been discussing all week -- SB 18xx (Burton), SB 78xx (Polanco), AB 82xx (Keeley) and AB 83xx (Wright) -- are still ""in play"" legislatively this evening, even though the governor told the Dow Jones Newswire earlier today that the proposals are not acceptable to him in their current form and encouraged the Assembly and Senate to stay in session (despite the scheduled summer break) until a bill acceptable to him could be agreed upon by the two houses and sent to him for signature:  * SB 78xx (Polanco) Electric Utility Rate Stabilization Act of 2001 passed out of the full Senate on Friday with 22 AYES and 17 NOES.  The originally introduced version of SB 78xx reflected the terms of the original Memorandum of Understanding (""MOU"") negotiated between Governor Davis and Southern California Edison (""Edison"").  It was recently amended to reflect Senator Sher's proposed ""Plan B"" of the MOU -- a version of the MOU opposed by Edison on the grounds that the bill would not leave Edison creditworthy. It was heard in the Senate Energy, Utilities and Communications Committee on Wednesday where it failed on a 4 AYES and 3 NOES vote.  Reconsideration was granted, however, and the bill passed out of the committee with 6 AYES and 2 NOES on Thursday morning. The authors took up amendments such as striking the urgency clause, changing the rate component from 125 KWs to 500 KWs, placing conservation lands into land trusts and deleting Section 399.26 (which insulated Edison International from certain claims) during the Thursday hearing.  SB 78xx was then passed out of the Senate Appropriations Committee on Thursday with 7 AYES and 3 NOES.  * SB 18xx (Burton) Department of Water Resources: electricity: bond financing order passed out of the full Senate on Friday with 35 AYES and 2 NOES, making it possible for DWR to issue bonds at a lower, cheaper rate than allotted in AB 1x (Keeley) assuming the Assembly concurs and the bill is signed by Governor Davis.  The bill also prohibits any additional charges such as consultants and ad campaigns unless approved by the Legislature and requires certain ""sunshine"" provisions for greater scrutiny of contracts entered to by the DWR.  We understand that J.P. Morgan and Lehman Brothers -- the firms working with State Treasurer Angelides on the bond offering -- have advised the governor's office that SB 18xx could delay the issuance of the bonds indefinitely for a variety of reasons, so it is unclear whether this bill will ever be signed.  The bill was heard by the Senate Energy, Utilities and Communications Committee on Thursday where it passed with a 10 AYES and 0 NOES vote.  It next must be heard in the Assembly.  * AB 82xx (Keeley) Electric Utility Rate Stabilization Act of 2001 passed out of Assembly Energy Costs and Availability Committee Wednesday evening on a 11 AYES and 9 NOES vote.  It was then heard later the same evening by the Assembly Appropriations Committee, where it was passed on a 11 AYES and 6 NOES vote.  This is the ""compromise"" bill we have been discussing all week authored by Speaker Hertzberg and Assembly Member Fred Keeley.  The bill continues to be a work in progress as we write this report, with significant amendments being considered and awaiting a vote by the full Assembly, possibly later this evening.  The current version of the bill provides for limited direct access, state purchase of Edison's transmission lines for $2.4 billion, a minimum 30 percent ""haircut"" for the major generators and a ""trust"" to cover all claims not dealt with by the haircut option.  * AB 83xx (Wright) Alternative Electric Utility Rate Stabilization Act of 2001 was amended into AB 50xx (by Assembly Member Bill Campbell) in the Assembly Energy Costs and Availability Committee Wednesday evening, and then passed out of committee with 11 AYES and 9 NOES.  It next must be heard by the Assembly Appropriations Committee, barring a rule waiver.  No such committee hearing is scheduled at this time.  Co-authored by Assembly Members Rod Wright, Keith Richman, Joe Canciamilla and Bill Campbell, the bill would allow the utilities to impose a basic monthly charge to address the net undercollection, among other things.   Other energy-related developments this week include:  * SB 84xx (Burton) State Energy Resources Conservation and Development Commission passed out of the full Senate on Friday with 30 AYES and 1 NO and sent to the Assembly. This bill provides $10 million from the state General Fund to the California Energy Commission (""CEC"") to fund a matching grant program for a battery backup power source for LED traffic signals. The grant program will be administered by the CEC, in consultation with local governments, and will provide 70 percent of the cost of the battery backup system.  It next must be heard in the Assembly.  * The FERC is expected to consider disbanding the current ISO Board for an independent slate of directors on Wednesday, the FERC announced on Friday.   Despite a Dec 15, 2000, FERC order requiring the appointment of an independent governing board for the ISO, the state has refused to follow the order citing that only the state legislature can change the composition of the board. Supporters of the FERC order argue that political appointees should not oversee power markets due to the state's domineering role in purchasing power on behalf of the beleaguered utilities.  * SB 85xx (Burton) Electrical restructuring: rates passed out of the full Senate on Thursday with 37 AYES and 0 NOES.  This bill bars the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) from raising rates back to the pre-10 percent rate reduction levels solely because the mandatory rate reduction period has expired on March 31, 2002.  It next must be heard in the Assembly.  * The Senate gave authorization to the Senate Select Committee to Investigate Market Manipulation on Thursday to subpoena top energy company executives to provide testimony and further insight into their companies' trading practices.  The resolution -- SR 14 -- passed out with 28 AYES and 6 NOES.  * The Senate Select Committee to Investigate Market Manipulation voted unanimously on Wednesday to ask the full Senate to find Texas-based Reliant Energy in contempt for failing to comply with a subpoena for documents. Despite Reliant's having handed over 10,000 documents, the committee rejected them after being unable to reach agreement over the confidentiality of Reliant's documents. The committee stepped back from its contempt vote last week against Enron after the company and committee moved closer to agreement over its release of thousands of documents stored in Texas. Mirant resolved its pending contempt citation by agreeing to turn over subpoenaed documents.  The contempt citation against Reliant will be presented to the full Senate, and then immediately sent to the Rules Committee for another hearing before the full Senate acts, Dunn said.  * The state's estimate of being overcharged for electricity dropped from $8.9 billion to $6.1 billion after a FERC judge ordered a readjustment in the state's figure on Wednesday.  Although the state continues to argue that the $8.9 billion figure is correct, FERC Judge Curtis Wagner called the figure ""baseless"" and criticized the California delegation for ""not negotiating in good faith"" during the recent settlement discussions.  The new amount, $6.1 billion, does not include power sales to municipal utilities and alternative energy suppliers -- two entities that do not fall under the purview of the ISO, PX or the state DWR -- as well as applies FERC price controls imposed June 19 and retroactively takes into account sales from October 2 onward.  * AB 28xx (Migden) Electrical restructuring: Oversight Board: ISO passed out of the Senate Energy, Utilities and Communications Committee on Tuesday to Senate Appropriations with 7 AYES and 0 NOES.  It was amended by the author in committee to ""double-join"" it to SB 39xx (see below).  This amendment ""ties"" the ultimate fate of AB 28xx to the fate of AB 39xx, unless the double-joiner language is removed from the bill before it goes to the governor for signature, assuming the bill gets to the governor.  * SB 39xx (Speier) Public utilities failed to pass out of the Assembly Energy Costs and Availability Committee on Tuesday with 7 AYES and 10 NOES. Reconsideration for the bill to be reheard in the committee was granted to the author.  Given the failure of SB 39xx in committee, AB 28xx is effectively ""dead"" as well for the moment (see discussion of AB 28xx above.)

This entire week has been focused on devising a ""solution"" for the energy crisis in addition to negotiating the passage of the state budget. Although the Democratic leadership of the Assembly and the Governor successfully lobbied four Assembly Republican lawmakers to switch sides and vote for the budget on Monday, the four Republicans have refused to vote for five crucia= l ""trailer"" bills which are necessary to implement the budget bill. There are approximately 18 trailer bills that must be passed in addition to the budge= t bill, but 5 have raised concerns for the Republicans:  SB 767 Transportatio= n Funding Shift, SB 735 Elimination of School Facility Fee Housing Programs, SB 1041 Omnibus Health Trailer Bill,  AB 144 Public Social Services and SB 79 Omnibus Social Services Trailer bill.  Senate President pro Tempore John Burton has stated that they will not vote on the budget bill in the Senate until the trailer bills are approved by the Assembly.  As of 7:00 p.m. tonight, there is no budget deal.  Meanwhile, on the energy front, the four proposals we have been discussing all week -- SB 18xx (Burton), SB 78xx (Polanco), AB 82xx (Keeley) and AB 83xx (Wright) -- are still ""in play"" legislatively this evening, even thoug= h the governor told the Dow Jones Newswire earlier today that the proposals are not acceptable to him in their current form and encouraged the Assembly and Senate to stay in session (despite the scheduled summer break) until a bill acceptable to him could be agreed upon by the two houses and sent to him for signature:  *=09SB 78xx (Polanco) Electric Utility Rate Stabilization Act of 2001 passed out of the full Senate on Friday with 22 AYES and 17 NOES.  The originally introduced version of SB 78xx reflected the terms of the origina= l Memorandum of Understanding (""MOU"") negotiated between Governor Davis and Southern California Edison (""Edison"").  It was recently amended to reflect Senator Sher's proposed ""Plan B"" of the MOU -- a version of the MOU opposed by Edison on the grounds that the bill would not leave Edison creditworthy. It was heard in the Senate Energy, Utilities and Communications Committee o= n Wednesday where it failed on a 4 AYES and 3 NOES vote.  Reconsideration was granted, however, and the bill passed out of the committee with 6 AYES and = 2 NOES on Thursday morning. The authors took up amendments such as striking the urgency clause, changing the rate component from 125 KWs to 500 KWs, placing conservation lands into land trusts and deleting Section 399.26 (which insulated Edison International from certain claims) during the Thursday hearing.  SB 78xx was then passed out of the Senate Appropriations Committee on Thursday with 7 AYES and 3 NOES.  *=09SB 18xx (Burton) Department of Water Resources: electricity: bond financing order passed out of the full Senate on Friday with 35 AYES and 2 NOES, making it possible for DWR to issue bonds at a lower, cheaper rate than allotted in AB 1x (Keeley) assuming the Assembly concurs and the bill is signed by Governor Davis.  The bill also prohibits any additional charge= s such as consultants and ad campaigns unless approved by the Legislature and requires certain ""sunshine"" provisions for greater scrutiny of contracts entered to by the DWR.  We understand that J.P. Morgan and Lehman Brothers -- the firms working with State Treasurer Angelides on the bond offering -- have advised the governor's office that SB 18xx could delay the issuance of the bonds indefinitely for a variety of reasons, so it is unclear whether this bill will ever be signed.  The bill was heard by the Senate Energy, Utilities and Communications Committee on Thursday where it passed with a 1= 0 AYES and 0 NOES vote.  It next must be heard in the Assembly.  *=09AB 82xx (Keeley) Electric Utility Rate Stabilization Act of 2001 passed out of Assembly Energy Costs and Availability Committee Wednesday evening on a 11 AYES and 9 NOES vote.  It was then heard later the same evening by the Assembly Appropriations Committee, where it was passed on a 11 AYES and 6 NOES vote.  This is the ""compromise"" bill we have been discussing all week authored by Speaker Hertzberg and Assembly Member Fred Keeley.  The bill continues to be a work in progress as we write this report, with significant amendments being considered and awaiting a vote by the full Assembly, possibly later this evening.  The current version of the bill provides for limited direct access, state purchase of Edison's transmission lines for $2.4 billion, a minimum 30 percent ""haircut"" for the major generators and a ""trust"" to cover all claims not dealt with by the haircut option.  *=09AB 83xx (Wright) Alternative Electric Utility Rate Stabilization Act of 2001 was amended into AB 50xx (by Assembly Member Bill Campbell) in the Assembly Energy Costs and Availability Committee Wednesday evening, and the= n passed out of committee with 11 AYES and 9 NOES.  It next must be heard by the Assembly Appropriations Committee, barring a rule waiver.  No such committee hearing is scheduled at this time.  Co-authored by Assembly Members Rod Wright, Keith Richman, Joe Canciamilla and Bill Campbell, the bill would allow the utilities to impose a basic monthly charge to address the net undercollection, among other things.   Other energy-related developments this week include:  *=09SB 84xx (Burton) State Energy Resources Conservation and Development Commission passed out of the full Senate on Friday with 30 AYES and 1 NO an= d sent to the Assembly. This bill provides $10 million from the state General Fund to the California Energy Commission (""CEC"") to fund a matching grant program for a battery backup power source for LED traffic signals. The gran= t program will be administered by the CEC, in consultation with local governments, and will provide 70 percent of the cost of the battery backup system.  It next must be heard in the Assembly.  *=09The FERC is expected to consider disbanding the current ISO Board for an independent slate of directors on Wednesday, the FERC announced on Friday.   Despite a Dec 15, 2000, FERC order requiring the appointment of a= n independent governing board for the ISO, the state has refused to follow th= e order citing that only the state legislature can change the composition of the board. Supporters of the FERC order argue that political appointees should not oversee power markets due to the state's domineering role in purchasing power on behalf of the beleaguered utilities.  *=09SB 85xx (Burton) Electrical restructuring: rates passed out of the full Senate on Thursday with 37 AYES and 0 NOES.  This bill bars the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) from raising rates back to th= e pre-10 percent rate reduction levels solely because the mandatory rate reduction period has expired on March 31, 2002.  It next must be heard in the Assembly.  *=09The Senate gave authorization to the Senate Select Committee to Investigate Market Manipulation on Thursday to subpoena top energy company executives to provide testimony and further insight into their companies' trading practices.  The resolution -- SR 14 -- passed out with 28 AYES and = 6 NOES.  *=09The Senate Select Committee to Investigate Market Manipulation voted unanimously on Wednesday to ask the full Senate to find Texas-based Reliant Energy in contempt for failing to comply with a subpoena for documents. Despite Reliant's having handed over 10,000 documents, the committee rejected them after being unable to reach agreement over the confidentialit= y of Reliant's documents. The committee stepped back from its contempt vote last week against Enron after the company and committee moved closer to agreement over its release of thousands of documents stored in Texas. Mirant resolved its pending contempt citation by agreeing to turn over subpoenaed documents.  The contempt citation against Reliant will be presented to the full Senate, and then immediately sent to the Rules Committee for another hearing before the full Senate acts, Dunn said.  *=09The state's estimate of being overcharged for electricity dropped from $8.9 billion to $6.1 billion after a FERC judge ordered a readjustment in the state's figure on Wednesday.  Although the state continues to argue that the $8.9 billion figure is correct, FERC Judge Curtis Wagner called th= e figure ""baseless"" and criticized the California delegation for ""not negotiating in good faith"" during the recent settlement discussions.  The new amount, $6.1 billion, does not include power sales to municipal utilities and alternative energy suppliers -- two entities that do not fall under the purview of the ISO, PX or the state DWR -- as well as applies FER= C price controls imposed June 19 and retroactively takes into account sales from October 2 onward.  *=09AB 28xx (Migden) Electrical restructuring: Oversight Board: ISO passed out of the Senate Energy, Utilities and Communications Committee on Tuesday to Senate Appropriations with 7 AYES and 0 NOES.  It was amended by the author in committee to ""double-join"" it to SB 39xx (see below).  This amendment ""ties"" the ultimate fate of AB 28xx to the fate of AB 39xx, unles= s the double-joiner language is removed from the bill before it goes to the governor for signature, assuming the bill gets to the governor.  *=09SB 39xx (Speier) Public utilities failed to pass out of the Assembly Energy Costs and Availability Committee on Tuesday with 7 AYES and 10 NOES. Reconsideration for the bill to be reheard in the committee was granted to the author.  Given the failure of SB 39xx in committee, AB 28xx is effectively ""dead"" as well for the moment (see discussion of AB 28xx above.= )    Best regards, Tom McMorrow and Mike Martinez   <<IEPA Legislative Report.DOC>>   - IEPA Legislative Report (4).DOC","alan.comnes@enron.com, angela.schwarz@enron.com, beverly.aden@enron.com,   brenda.barreda@enron.com, carol.moffett@enron.com,   cathy.corbin@enron.com, h..foster@enron.com,   christina.liscano@enron.com, f..calger@enron.com,   craig.sutter@enron.com, dan.leff@enron.com,   debora.whitehead@enron.com, dennis.benevides@enron.com,   don.black@enron.com, douglas.huth@enron.com, edward.sacks@enron.com,   eric.melvin@enron.com, erika.dupre@enron.com, evan.hughes@enron.com,   fran.deltoro@enron.com, gayle.muench@enron.com,   ginger.dernehl@enron.com, gordon.savage@enron.com,   harold.buchanan@enron.com, harry.kingerski@enron.com,   d..steffes@enron.com, james.lewis@enron.com, james.wright@enron.com,   jeff.messina@enron.com, jeremy.blachman@enron.com,   jess.hewitt@enron.com, joe.hartsoe@enron.com, karen.denne@enron.com,   kathy.bass@enron.com, kathy.dodgen@enron.com,   ken.gustafson@enron.com, kevin.hughes@enron.com,   leasa.lopez@enron.com, leticia.botello@enron.com,   mark.muller@enron.com, marsha.suggs@enron.com, marty.sunde@enron.com,   meredith.eggleston@enron.com, michael.etringer@enron.com,   michael.mann@enron.com, d..cisneros@enron.com, neil.hong@enron.com,   paul.kaufman@enron.com, richard.zdunkewicz@enron.com,   richard.leibert@enron.com, richard.shapiro@enron.com,   rita.hennessy@enron.com, robert.badeer@enron.com,   rosalinda.tijerina@enron.com, sarah.novosel@enron.com,   scott.gahn@enron.com, scott.stoness@enron.com, sharon.dick@enron.com,   tanya.leslie@enron.com, tasha.lair@enron.com, ted.murphy@enron.com,   terri.greenlee@enron.com, tim.belden@enron.com,   tony.spruiell@enron.com, vicki.sharp@enron.com,   vladimir.gorny@enron.com, wanda.curry@enron.com,   s..bradford@enron.com, jubran.whalan@enron.com, b..sanders@enron.com,   c..williams@enron.com, linda.robertson@enron.com,   ren�.lazure@enron.com, michael.tribolet@enron.com,   k..allen@enron.com, christian.yoder@enron.com, greg.wolfe@enron.com,   jeff.dasovich@enron.com, dirk.vanulden@enron.com,   steve.walker@enron.com, james.wright@enron.com, mike.smith@enron.com,   richard.shapiro@enron.com, leslie.lawner@enron.com,   robert.neustaedter@enron.com, steve.walton@enron.com,   mark.fillinger@enron.com, jennifer.rudolph@enron.com,   martin.wenzel@enron.com, ray.alvarez@enron.com,   david.leboe@enron.com, jay.zoellner@enron.com,   fatimata.liamidi@enron.com, sonia.perez@enron.com,   chris.holmes@enron.com, venkatesh.mani@enron.com,   richard.crevelt@enron.com, dave.perrino@enron.com,   malcolm.adkins@enron.com, kevin.keeney@enron.com,   chris.stokley@enron.com, c..hall@enron.com, tracy.ngo@enron.com,   tony.riley@enron.com, david.delainey@enron.com,   louise.kitchen@enron.com, john.lavorato@enron.com,   gary.sova@enron.com, minal.dalia@enron.com, greg.whalley@enron.com,   janet.dietrich@enron.com",susan.mara@enron.com,RE: Legislative Report (07/20/2001),2001-07-22 23:24:38-07:00,sent

That was ""70 times the recourse rate,"" said Commissioner Linda Breathitt, who called the matter up for discussion at the Commission's regular meeting. ""Thirty-eight cents versus $27, that's a big difference in prices and we ought to be looking at that,"" responded Commissioner William Massey.  ""...[W]e believe closer scrutiny of transactions that provide the opportunity to impose rates many multiples in excess of maximum approved tariff rates is necessary, especially in light of our serious concern regarding the high prices for natural gas in California relative to prices in the rest of the country and their consequential effect on wholesale electricity prices in California,"" the order noted [RP97-288-009].  FERC's action was in response to a show cause order it issued in March, directing Transwestern to explain how it had firm capacity available on its pipeline to move gas under the negotiated-rate transactions, and why its actions in entering into the negotiated-rate agreements didn't violate Commission regulations and policy regarding firm transportation service and negotiated-rate agreements.  FERC's order requires Transwestern to make certain changes to the posting of daily capacity. ""I'm satisfied that this should take care of the issue prospectively,"" Breathitt said. But with respect to the negotiated agreements, ""our order today establishes a hearing of limited scope on a fast-track basis to determine whether Transwestern exercised market power in awarding these...contracts.""  It directs an administrative law judge to convene a pre-hearing conference within 10 days, and issue an initial decision on the matter within 60 days. The hearing will focus on three issues: 1) whether Transwestern capacity was advertised and awarded in a fair manner; 2) whether the rates negotiated were the result of the exercise of market power; and 3) why the capacity awarded was available without interruption while recourse service was not available. ""In addition, I have a question [as to] why shippers agreed to such rates when much lower recourse rates should have been available under our negotiated rate program,"" Breathitt said.  The shippers that entered into the negotiated-rate transactions with Transwestern include Richardson Products Co., Sempra Energy Trading Corp., BP Energy Co., Astra Power LLC and Reliant Energy Services.

Thanks, Jeff  ********************************************************************************************** Got the California PUC to agree 1) not to place rate-cap related surcharges on Direct Access customers in SDG&E's service territory, and 2) not to impose 3 cent rate increase on DA customers in PG&E and Edison service territories. Got the PUC to delay votes threatening to suspend, or end, Direct Access in California. Got Senators Dunn and Burton to agree to postpone vote on Senator Dunn's report recommending that the full Sentate vote to 1) find Enron in contempt and 2) impose steep fines pending compliance by Enron. Got the PUC to postpone a vote which would have 1) amended the way California applies the ""PX Credit"" and 2) harmed EES' financial position. Provided the California Assembly Speaker with analysis supporting a core/noncore electricity market structure in California, which the Speaker then embraced as his own and established a working group in an attempt to implement the proposal in California. Helped reach an agreement with Edison to delay a PUC proceeding in which the Administrative Law Judge could have forced Enron to submit commercially sensitive information. Helped get California policymakers to agree to 1) raise prices in order to return the IOUs to creditworthiness; 2) establish a ""demand buy-down"" proposal; 3) focus on the need to expedite plant siting and construction; and 4) enter into long-term contracts to reduce exposure to price volatility.

The arguments supporting= =20 this  position are as follows:  Direct  access customers were specifically exempted from the=20 procurement-related rate  increase because they do not receive procurement= =20 service.? They should therefore be similarly  exempted from the12-month=20 procurement surcharge, even if they subsequently  returned to bundled=20 service.? =20 The inability of PG&E to pay all amounts  due and owing under the PX credit= =20 have caused the budgets of ABAG POWER  Members to be placed under significa= nt=20 financial stress.?

ABAG POWER asks simply  that the Commission afford=20 similar protection to the direct access customers  of PG&E who did not=20 receive bundled procurement service during the  interval between the March= =20 and May Decisions.?=20 Moreover, in addition  to being inequitable, the application of the=20 procurement surcharge to  non-procurement direct access customers would be= =20 discriminatory and would  cause the utilities to violate the=20 anti-discrimination provisions of the  Public Utilities Code, Sections 453(= a)=20 and 453(c).

A representative of DWR was present as were several representatives of the consulting firm Navigant which assisted DWR in constructing its revenue requirement request.  The representatives of Navigant fielded most of the questions.  Not much new information was garnered.  A little more clarity was shed on certain areas. Of interest to Enron would be that in determining the net short for each of the UDCs for which DWR was purchasing it assumed no change in the current direct access levels (which is approximately 2% of the load in the state) through 2002.  Other points of clarification included:  (1) A question exists with respect to whether DWR is responsible for the ISO costs billed to the UDCs for the period of January through June of 2001.  (2) Any payments which were made to DWR to date by the UDCs would be netted against the revenue requirements requests for the first and second quarter of this year.  PG&E indicated that DWR's numbers for the revenue received from PG&E to date do not match its own accounting.  (3) The net short calculation for each UDC was derived by using the net short forecasts provided by each of the UDCs an modifying them to take into account (1) a 4% reduction in load due to conservation efforts; (2) a 2% reduction in load due to price elasticity increasing to 3% by January 2001; (3) estimated impacts of the 20/20 program (assuming also a similar program for next summer); (4) the impact of the UDCs curtailment programs.  Once again, PG&E indicated its belief that DWR's net short projection for PG&E was erroneous.  (4)  DWR explained that the basis for the projection that they would need 1.65 cents out of the three cents rate increase was that for sales made by DWR they already receive the UDC generation rate (i.e., approximately 6.8 cent for PG&E and 7.2 cent for SCE).  On top of that, they need the 1.65 cents.  SCE submitted four pages of written questions to DWR on their revenue request.  DWR is to respond in writing (and serve on all people on the service list ) by Tuesday the 31st.  To the extent that the questions are applicable to PG&E, they will answer the question with respect to both UDCs.  Please call if you have any questions.

Despite the summer break, leaders in the Assembly planned to call back their side of the Legislature to debate and vote on a ""rescue"" plan for Southern California Edison. The new effort was outlined in our Tuesday fax to each of you.  In short, the new plan called for amending SB 78xx and AB 82xx to, among other things, provide for a dedicated rate component to support a $2.9 billion bond financing by Edison, but would have prevented Edison from using the funds to pay generators, PX and ISO invoices, directly or indirectly. The $2.9 billion could be used to pay QFs.  The dedicated rate component for repayment of the bonds would apply to all consumers for two years, and then apply solely to non-core customers.  Additionally, under the plan, the 30% haircut/trust account concept was deleted, the decision on a transmission line purchase was deferred to settlement discussions between the state and Edison, the RPS targeted a 10% growth in new generating capacity through 2010, and direct access would be permitted under certain circumstances effective no earlier than January 1, 2002.  The Assembly leadership planned on holding an informational meeting on the new plan on Thursday, July 26 and committee and floor votes on the plan today, Friday, July 27.  However, the leadership could not garner enough votes for this new plan this week, so no informational hearing was held, nor will any votes be held today.  Even if this new plan had been approved by the Assembly this week, Senator Burton's office made it very clear that Senator Burton had no intention of bringing his house back in to session to vote on the measure.  Accordingly, barring the governor calling the legislature back into session, we do not expect any other activity on this new plan before the legislature reconvenes on August 20, and perhaps not then either.  Other events this week include:  * In Thursday's Los Angeles Times, S. David Freeman -- Governor Davis' primary negotiator on the long-term contract deals -- authored an editorial arguing that the state's long-term energy contracts were a primary factor in the recent reduction in energy prices on the spot market.  You can find the article at www.latimes.com.  It ran on the editorial page on Thursday, July 26.  * It is our understanding that on Thursday Senator Byron Sher had draft amendments prepared by his staff to amend SB 532 to address Renewable Portfolio Standards issues.  The amendments are not yet public, but we are hopeful that we will be able to obtain them when his staff returns next week.  We will keep you apprised.  * FERC ordered hearings on Wednesday to determine how much money electric generators owe California for wholesale power overcharges.  With California still insisting that it is owed $8.9 billion by generators, the expected FERC decision on the refund amount is certain to fall short of the state's expectations.  Lawsuits are expected to follow issuance of the decision.  In a press statement earlier this week, the governor stated his hopes that California will receive all $8.9 billion adding, ""As for the energy profiteers and pirates, let me make clear that I will not rest until every dollar gouged from California businesses and residents returns to California. If the FERC does not make California whole, we will see you in court.""  * U.S. Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham unveiled a plan on Monday that would expand California's power grid along Path 15 by attracting private investment to cover the $300 million project.  He hopes by increasing the transmission capacity by 1,500 MWs, this plan would alleviate the ""transmission bottleneck"" that has proved ""simply insufficient"" for power to flow freely throughout the state during times of peak usage.  * According to Senator Dunn, Morgan Stanley destroyed key documents ""years ago"" relating to the purchase of California power plants despite the financial company's repeated promises to the Senate Select Committee to Investigate Market Manipulation that they would turn them over, as reported on Monday.  Meanwhile, the committee continued to move forward with their contempt proceedings against Enron and Reliant for refusing to hand over key documents to the committee.  * Reliant Energy sued California on Monday, claiming ""just compensation"" for the state's failure to adequately pay for long-term power contracts that the governor seized from the Power Exchange in February.  The state claims those contracts equal about $160 million while Reliant calculates that the same contracts are worth more than $300 million.  A judge is expected to oversee this dispute.

"As we discussed in our special call last week, I asked Brian Cragg from  Goodin McBride to look into the issue of what, if anything, the CPUC can do  in lieu of suspending direct access.  ABX 1 says the CPUC ""shall suspend"" DA, but does not give any time line for  doing so, nor any criterita to use in making the determination to suspend  it.  This gives the CPUC ample ability to delay suspending DA, especially  while bills affecting DA are in play in Sacramento. The President could have  her own investigation or propose her own solutions -- all the while delaying  the suspension.  Brian also thought she could possibly put her own DA plan in  place -- although he said it was a ""stretch.""  Brian said she could, for  example, argue that limiting DA to the net short position was a way of  implementing ABX 1.  He felt that adding an exit fee as well was , however,  stretching the concept a bit too far.  Nonethless, limiting DA to a net short  position could be argued to be within her existing authority under the law.  She could also institute an ""open season"" through some defined date, such as  Jan 1, 2002, and suspend DA thereafter.  She could take this action subject to the passage of superceding legislation  -- which, of course, could either kill DA altogether or implement some  combination of exit fee/DAopen season/DA limitation.

Despite the summer break, leaders in the Assembly planned to call back thei= r side of the Legislature to debate and vote on a ""rescue"" plan for Southern California Edison. The new effort was outlined in our Tuesday fax to each o= f you.  In short, the new plan called for amending SB 78xx and AB 82xx to, among other things, provide for a dedicated rate component to support a $2.= 9 billion bond financing by Edison, but would have prevented Edison from usin= g the funds to pay generators, PX and ISO invoices, directly or indirectly. The $2.9 billion could be used to pay QFs.  The dedicated rate component fo= r repayment of the bonds would apply to all consumers for two years, and then apply solely to non-core customers.  Additionally, under the plan, the 30% haircut/trust account concept was deleted, the decision on a transmission line purchase was deferred to settlement discussions between the state and Edison, the RPS targeted a 10% growth in new generating capacity through 2010, and direct access would be permitted under certain circumstances effective no earlier than January 1, 2002.  The Assembly leadership planned on holding an informational meeting on the new plan on Thursday, July 26 an= d committee and floor votes on the plan today, Friday, July 27.  However, the leadership could not garner enough votes for this new plan this week, so no informational hearing was held, nor will any votes be held today.  Even if this new plan had been approved by the Assembly this week, Senator Burton's office made it very clear that Senator Burton had no intention of bringing his house back in to session to vote on the measure.  Accordingly, barring the governor calling the legislature back into session, we do not expect an= y other activity on this new plan before the legislature reconvenes on August 20, and perhaps not then either.  Other events this week include:  *=09In Thursday's Los Angeles Times, S. David Freeman -- Governor Davis' primary negotiator on the long-term contract deals -- authored an editorial arguing that the state's long-term energy contracts were a primary factor i= n the recent reduction in energy prices on the spot market.  You can find the article at www.latimes.com.  It ran on the editorial page on Thursday, July 26.  *=09It is our understanding that on Thursday Senator Byron Sher had draft amendments prepared by his staff to amend SB 532 to address Renewable Portfolio Standards issues.  The amendments are not yet public, but we are hopeful that we will be able to obtain them when his staff returns next week.  We will keep you apprised.  *=09FERC ordered hearings on Wednesday to determine how much money electric generators owe California for wholesale power overcharges.  With California still insisting that it is owed $8.9 billion by generators, the expected FERC decision on the refund amount is certain to fall short of the state's expectations.  Lawsuits are expected to follow issuance of the decision.  In a press statement earlier this week, the governor stated his hopes that California will receive all $8.9 billion adding, ""As for the energy profiteers and pirates, let me make clear that I will not rest until every dollar gouged from California businesses and residents returns to California. If the FERC does not make California whole, we will see you in court.""  *=09U.S. Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham unveiled a plan on Monday that would expand California's power grid along Path 15 by attracting private investment to cover the $300 million project.  He hopes by increasing the transmission capacity by 1,500 MWs, this plan would alleviate the ""transmission bottleneck"" that has proved ""simply insufficient"" for power t= o flow freely throughout the state during times of peak usage.  *=09According to Senator Dunn, Morgan Stanley destroyed key documents ""years ago"" relating to the purchase of California power plants despite the financial company's repeated promises to the Senate Select Committee to Investigate Market Manipulation that they would turn them over, as reported on Monday.  Meanwhile, the committee continued to move forward with their contempt proceedings against Enron and Reliant for refusing to hand over ke= y documents to the committee.  *=09Reliant Energy sued California on Monday, claiming ""just compensation"" for the state's failure to adequately pay for long-term power contracts that the governor seized from the Power Exchange in February.  Th= e state claims those contracts equal about $160 million while Reliant calculates that the same contracts are worth more than $300 million.  A judge is expected to oversee this dispute.

On behalf of ABAG, I woul= d  like to solicit your support of this petition.  The decision in question=  is  the Commission's May 15 decision where it approved the rate design for=  the  three-cent rate increase. =20 =20 You may recall that the decision approved a 12-month surcharge for all  bun= dled service customers to make up for the revenue which PG&E and SCE did  n= ot recover during the interim period between the March 27 issuance of  D.01= -03-082 and the subsequent issuance of the May 15 decision.  You also  know=  that the May decision provided specifically that DA customers were NOT to =  be subject to the rate increase.=20 =20 The ABAG petition for modification seeks to have the Commission clarify  th= at DA customers who received DA service during the interim period between t= he  two decisions should not be subject to the one-year sucharge, even if t= hey were  subsequently returned to bundled service.  The arguments supporti= ng this  position are as follows:  Direct  access customers were specifically exempted from the procurement-re= lated rate  increase because they do not receive procurement service.  They=  should therefore be similarly  exempted from the12-month procurement surch= arge, even if they subsequently  returned to bundled service.  =20 The inability of PG&E to pay all amounts  due and owing under the PX credit=  have caused the budgets of ABAG POWER  Members to be placed under signific= ant financial stress.  The Member public agencies have  suffered extreme fi= nancial hardship.   The application of the 12-month procurement surcharge h= as added to that  burden unnecessarily. In a separate  proceeding (draft Resolution E-3726),  the Commission has ex= pressed  its intent to ""guard against inequities"" for direct access custome= rs of  SDG&E.  ABAG POWER asks simply  that the Commission afford similar p= rotection to the direct access customers  of PG&E who did not receive bundl= ed procurement service during the  interval between the March and May Decis= ions. =20 Moreover, in addition  to being inequitable, the application of the procure= ment surcharge to  non-procurement direct access customers would be discrim= inatory and would  cause the utilities to violate the anti-discrimination p= rovisions of the  Public Utilities Code, Sections 453(a) and 453(c).  ABAG POWER  would very much appreciate the support of ESPs and other market=  participants at  the Commission.  Under Rule 47(f) of the Commission's Rul= es of Practice and  Procedure, ""Responses to petitions for modification mus= t be filed and served  within 30 days of the date that the petition was ser= ved, unless the  administrative law judge sets a different date. Responses = must be served on the  petitioner and on all  parties who were served with = the petition and must  comply with the requirements of Rules 2, 2.1, 2.2, 2= .3, and 2.5.""

A representative of DWR was present as were several representatives of the consulting firm Navigant which assisted DWR in constructing its revenue requirement request.  The representatives of Navigant fielded most of the questions.  Not much new information was garnered.  A little more clarity was shed on certain areas. Of interest to Enron would be that in determining the net short for each of the UDCs for which DWR was purchasing it assumed no change in the current direct access levels (which is approximately 2% of the load in the state) through 2002.  Other points of clarification included:  (1) A question exists with respect to whether DWR is responsible for the ISO costs billed to the UDCs for the period of January through June of 2001.  (2) Any payments which were made to DWR to date by the UDCs would be netted against the revenue requirements requests for the first and second quarter of this year.  PG&E indicated that DWR's numbers for the revenue received from PG&E to date do not match its own accounting.  (3) The net short calculation for each UDC was derived by using the net short forecasts provided by each of the UDCs an modifying them to take into account (1) a 4% reduction in load due to conservation efforts; (2) a 2% reduction in load due to price elasticity increasing to 3% by January 2001; (3) estimated impacts of the 20/20 program (assuming also a similar program for next summer); (4) the impact of the UDCs curtailment programs.  Once again, PG&E indicated its belief that DWR's net short projection for PG&E was erroneous.  (4)  DWR explained that the basis for the projection that they would need 1.65 cents out of the three cents rate increase was that for sales made by DWR they already receive the UDC generation rate (i.e., approximately 6.8 cent for PG&E and 7.2 cent for SCE).  On top of that, they need the 1.65 cents.  SCE submitted four pages of written questions to DWR on their revenue request.  DWR is to respond in writing (and serve on all people on the service list ) by Tuesday the 31st.  To the extent that the questions are applicable to PG&E, they will answer the question with respect to both UDCs.  Please call if you have any questions.

"As we discussed in our special call last week, I asked Brian Cragg from Goodin McBride to look into the issue of what, if anything, the CPUC can do in lieu of suspending direct access.  ABX 1 says the CPUC ""shall suspend"" DA, but does not give any time line for doing so, nor any criterita to use in making the determination to suspend it.  This gives the CPUC ample ability to delay suspending DA, especially while bills affecting DA are in play in Sacramento. The President could have her own investigation or propose her own solutions -- all the while delaying the suspension.  Brian also thought she could possibly put her own DA plan in place -- although he said it was a ""stretch.""  Brian said she could, for example, argue that limiting DA to the net short position was a way of implementing ABX 1.  He felt that adding an exit fee as well was , however, stretching the concept a bit too far.  Nonethless, limiting DA to a net short position could be argued to be within her existing authority under the law. She could also institute an ""open season"" through some defined date, such as Jan 1, 2002, and suspend DA thereafter.  She could take this action subject to the passage of superceding legislation -- which, of course, could either kill DA altogether or implement some combination of exit fee/DAopen season/DA limitation.

IZUMI Mr. Izumi is a senior fellow in California Studies at the San  Francisco- based Pacific Research Institute. On the surface, things seem to be going pretty good for Gov. Gray Davis with  regard to California's electricity crisis. The governor has scored some nice  publicity by switching on some new power plants. The weather has been  unseasonably cool. His poll numbers are edging back up. Yet beneath this  optimistic picture lie troubling problems. For example, Davis's argument that  out-of-state power generators are responsible for the electricity crisis has  been falling apart. For months, Davis has been claiming that private  generators have overcharged California by $8.9 billion and demanded that this  amount be refunded to the state. However, after a two-week mediation between  state officials and the generators, Curtis Wagner, the federal government's  chief energy regulatory judge, rebuked Davis's claim saying that such a huge  overcharge ""has not and cannot be substantiated."" Further, while the  generators may be liable to refund a much smaller amount to the state,  perhaps $1 billion, Wagner said that generators are owed more money by the  state than they owe the state in refunds: ""Can a cash refund be required  where a much larger amount is due the seller? The chief judge thinks not.""  Davis reacted to the judge's ruling by calling it a ""raw deal"" and by urging  the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to ignore the lack of evidence and  the judge's conclusions and to ""step up and provide the refunds we've asked  for."" Davis's position, as usual, is motivated purely by politics. Indeed,  Dan Walters of the Sacramento Bee says that Davis is operating in a  ""melodramatic virtual world"" de-linked from reality.  Davis's blame-the-generators argument took another body blow when newly  released documents showed that, on average, major out-of-state power  companies such as Enron, Duke, Dynergy and Mirant charged less than the  average prices paid by the state during the first three months of the year.  California government utilities, on the other hand, such as the Los Angeles  Department of Water and Power and the Sacramento Municipal Utility District  (SMUD), charged the state much more for electricity than the out-of-state  generators. For example, while Texas-based Enron, a favorite Davis whipping  boy, charged an average $181 per megawatt hour, SMUD charged an average $330  per megawatt hour.  Davis responded to this revelation in typical political fashion. A Davis  spokesman said that the governor had expressed his anger at ""the generators  who wear cowboy hats"" and that ""just because there are other entities that  are charging us more doesn't change the fact that we are getting ripped off  by companies from Houston, Tulsa, Atlanta or Charlotte.""  Yet, for all Davis' feigned indignation about consumers being ripped off, it  turns out that he and his regulators are poised to ensure that business  consumers are ripped off by state government. Davis has signed $43 billion in  ill-advised long-term purchase contracts at rates above-market-price. The  state must, therefore, ensure that enough business customers remain in the  current state-controlled distribution system to pay for high-priced state  power purchases. This is especially important to Davis since the high prices  are borne disproportionately by business. Thus, Davis' regulators are set to  eliminate ""direct access,"" which allows businesses to shop for cheaper power.  Who's the real gouger? No matter how much Davis points the finger,  Californians are paying dearly for his political opportunism and bad  policies.

"Here it is.  To explain, I left the sheet you saw previously as Sheet 1.   Sheet 2 is the new employee and business expense budget.  It shows  expenditures through 7/09/01 in the first column, our 2001 budget in the  second column, and a proposed 2002 budget in the third column.  Some of the  expenditures are kind of kooky -- because of miscoding or other reasons.  For  example, payments to IEP appear under ""Employee Pers --Other"" and ""Outside  Serv - Prof"".  There are many examples of kooky things -- so don't worry  about it.   We ended up getting charged for things this year that we didn't put in our  budget, such as AT&T calling cards and Edith's time -- so I've tried to  include all the items -- even if I put them in another category (for example,  I don't use the category ""EIS Allocation"" in our budget). I included those  wacky categories that we don't use in our budget at the bottom of column 1  just to get the correct total for the year to date.    Sheet 3 is outside expenses such as contributions, retainers and  memberships.  Column 1 shows our 2001 budget and column 3 shows our projected  2002 budget.

"ATTORNEY-CLIENT PRIVILEGE  Vicki,  As you requested, this e-mail describes the current status of the 1 cent surcharge.  1.  The 1 cent surcharge was approved by the CPUC in early January.  At the time, the Alliance for Retail Energy Markets (AReM), to which we belong, had protested its application to DA customers. Nonetheless, the CPUC approved the surcharge and its application to all customers, including DA customers, because of the ""emergency"" nature of the situation and because it was ""temporary.""  2.  The 3 cent surcharge was approved by the CPUC in the March 27 order.  Once again, AReM had protested its application to DA customers.  This time the CPUC explicitly exempted DA customers and stated that the surcharge was for generation-related costs going forward.  The CPUC also made the one cent surcharge permanent but did not address its application to DA customers -- therefore, in my view, the earlier decision still stands on that issue. As AReM had suggested, the CPUC also stated that DA Customers would NOT be billed for the surcharge NOR given any credit for it.  3.  The March order required the utilities to file Advice Letters to implement the surcharges.  This was done in April (I think) but the SCE and PG&E took two different approaches.  SCE, because of billing system limitations, decided to violate the CPUC order in its implementation -- it billed DA customers for BOTH surcharges but then gave them a CREDIT that included both surcharges. PG&E, on the other hand, did NOT charge DA customers for the 3 cent surcharge nor include it in any credit -- in compliance with the CPUC March order.  However, PG&E continued to charge the 1 cent surcharge to DA customers in compliance with the CPUC's January order.  4.  AReM filed comments/protests on the utility advice letters -- in May, I believe.  AReM supported SCE's approach for not charging the 1 cent surcharge and for looking the closest to a ""bottoms-up"" calculation. AReM did mention that SCE should NOT be charging then crediting the surcharges, however.  AReM supported PG&E's approach of neither charging nor crediting the surcharge -- but opposed PG&E's continued charging of the 1 cent surcharge.  AReM agreed with SCE that, given the discussion in the March order and the application of the surcharges to generation-related costs going forward, the 1 cent surcharge should NOT apply to DA customers.  5.  When Advice Letters are protested, the Energy Division staff of the CPUC prepares a Resolution that recommends how to address the protested issues.  The Resolution is then presented to the CPUC at a meeting and voted on. Usually we have between one day and one week to see the Resolution before it is voted on. No Resolution has come forward on these Advice Letters.  The CPUC has no time requirement for when Advice Letters must be resolved.  6.  Discussions between AReM members and the Energy Division staff indicate that the staff agrees with AReM and will support AReM's request when it drafts the Resolution.  7.  Initiating a formal change to the January order on the 1 cent surcharge would require the filing of a Petition to Modify (usually done within a year -- but I believe can be requested at any time thereafter with a special motion).  This would begin a formal process -- also WITH NO TIME LINE.  It would also bring out the big guns opposing direct access -- the unions and TURN (a supposed small customer advocacy group) -- making quick response and a win for AReM more problematic.  8.  AReM has decided to work with the Energy Division staff and see if we can get a favorable Resolution kicked out by the end of September. (The Energy Division staff is overloaded right now with all the DWR-related decisions required for the 8/23 meeting.) If not, AReM will consider making a formal Petition to Modify.  9.  I recommend that Enron continue with its current strategy to work through AReM to achieve a favorable outcome on the 1 cent surcharge.

"A major bill for direct access at this time is SBXX 27.  This draft bill has language (Section 3 - part e) that would allow the CA DWR to get a fee from direct access customers who return to utility service to avoid imposing costs on other customers or the state. ESPs would have to pay the fee if they send their customers back to bundled utility service. The fee would be ""equivalent to any unvoidable costs imposed on the department's portfolio attributable to the load"" of the returning customer.  ESPs would be required to post a bond or demonstrate insurance coverage before they can serve customers. So far, this latter requirement only applies to ESPs who serve small customers, but I could envision this expanding to all ESPs.","vicki.sharp@enron.com, jeff.dasovich@enron.com, david.delainey@enron.com,   tim.belden@enron.com, richard.shapiro@enron.com,   harry.kingerski@enron.com, f..calger@enron.com,   lamar.frazier@enron.com, d..steffes@enron.com, c..williams@enron.com,   louise.kitchen@enron.com, john.lavorato@enron.com,   jeff.richter@enron.com, steve.swain@enron.com, h..foster@enron.com,   don.black@enron.com, janet.dietrich@enron.com,   jeremy.blachman@enron.com, alan.comnes@enron.com,   mike.smith@enron.com, liz.gannaway@enron.com",susan.mara@enron.com,FEE FOR RETURNING CUSTOMERS IN PROPOSED LEGISLATION,2001-08-16 13:54:57-07:00,sent

"Hey, this is what we've been looking for! Steve, let me knwo when you get the nfo from the ISO  -----Original Message----- From: CRCommunications [mailto:CRCommunications@caiso.com] Sent: Thursday, August 16, 2001 2:23 PM To: ISO Market Participants; SC Settlements Contacts Subject: CAISO Notice - Underscheduling Penalty and PG&E Bankruptcy Claims Bar Date   IMPORTANT NOTICE UNDERSCHEDULING PENALTY AND PG&E BANKRUPTCY PROOF OF CLAIMS As you are aware, the claims bar date in the PG&E bankruptcy is September 5th.  Consistent with our practice of providing information held by the ISO to Market Participants that concerns the amounts that may be owed to them in part by PG&E, the ISO is today sending to each Scheduling Coordinator an accounting of the amounts it owes or is owed in the event the underscheduling penalty is not modified by FERC.  FERC adopted the underscheduling penalty in a December 15, 2000 Order.  Because there are several rehearing petitions pending regarding the underscheduling penalty, to date the ISO has calculated but has not invoiced amounts owed or owing pursuant to the underscheduling penalty.  It is our expectation that Scheduling Coordinators will share with individual entities for whom they schedule, information that is relevant to them. As we have advised in prior Market Notices, although the ISO settles transactions on behalf of Market Participants, the ISO is neither authorized nor in a position unilaterally to assert claims on behalf of Market Participants in any bankruptcy proceeding, i.e. assert claims of ""ISO Debtors"" against ""ISO Creditors"" (ISO Tariff Section 11.20.1).  Further, while the ISO may be asked by an ""ISO Debtor"" to assert such claims in the PX or PG&E bankruptcy cases, the ISO is not obliged to do so and will decline any such request.  The ISO expressly disavows any liability for any Market Participant's claims, whether or not the Market Participant files any such proofs of claim in the PX or PG&E bankruptcy proceedings. Further, as we have advised in prior Market Notices, all statements, including the information sent today regarding the underscheduling penalty, are subject to change.  A number of transactions are currently known to be the subject of disputes and market reruns.  There are also proceedings pending at FERC, Federal Courts, and State Courts, the outcomes of which may affect amounts owed by PG&E to each Market Participant or by the Market Participant to PG&E. In addition, we anticipate that further disputes and proceedings may arise and market reruns may be performed that will affect the calculation of such amounts.  The ISO will continue to work diligently to resolve these matters as quickly as possible.  Nonetheless, it is clear that significant issues may remain unresolved and/or unidentified by the claims bar date. Market Participants should consult their own legal COUNSEL as to their respective rights  and proofs of claims in the bankruptcy cases of the PX and PG&E.

"For 10 am PDT call -----Original Message----- From: Norman Plotkin [mailto:nplotkin@rcsis.com] Sent: Tuesday, August 28, 2001 9:46 AM To: arem@electric.com Subject: FW: Retroactive Suspension - SDG&E's message     -----Original Message----- From: Dan Douglass [mailto:douglass@energyattorney.com] Sent: Wednesday, August 22, 2001 8:03 PM To: Weller, Andrea; arem@electric.com; 'Norman Plotkin' Subject: Re: Retroactive Suspension - SDG&E's message   It would be surprising if the Commission did what SDG&E is suggesting.  From a strictly legal perspective, it is unlikely that the Commission would vote to suspend direct access retroactively.  Although an argument could be put forward that the Commission has the authority to do so, such an act could be challenged on U.S. Constitutional grounds as being violative of the Contracts Clause.  Moreover, from a practical perspective, retroactive suspension would be politically unpalatable and cause a good deal of protest from affected parties.  However, the Commission might choose to so regardless of these factors, due to political pressure from Sacramento to ensure the saleability of the power revenue bonds.   The Commission has frequently reserved to itself the power to modify existing contracts, particularly those entered into by utilities subject to its jurisdiction.  It has exercised this right often, using as justification wording contained in utility contracts that make the agreements subject to the Commission's continuing jurisdiction, including such modifications as it may direct.  For example, the standard ESP Service Agreement used by all three of the state's electric utilities provides that, ""This Agreement may be subject to such changes or modifications as the CPUC may from time to time direct or necessitate in the exercise of its jurisdiction, and the Parties may amend the Agreement to conform to changes directed or necessitated by the CPUC.""  This phraseology is typically referred to by the state's utilities as a ""regulatory out"" clause.     However, this sort of wording has not been required to be included in the contracts entered into by ESPs, as the Commission does not regulate these entities.  ESPs that plan to offer electric services to residential and small commercial customers must fulfill certain registration requirements, as adopted by the Commission in Decisions (D.) 99-05-034 and D.98-03-072 in accordance with Public Utilities Code Section 394(b).  However, ESPs who serve larger customers are not even subject to this registration requirement.  Most importantly, ESP terms and conditions of service are not subject to regulation by the Commission.  Therefore, the regulatory out language cited above is not customarily included in standard contracts signed between ESPs and their customers.   The absence of a regulatory out clause would make Commission efforts to modify retroactively contracts entered into between ESPs and their customers extremely suspect.  This is due to the fact that such action could be seen as violative of Section 10 of Article I of the United States Constitution.  It provides in part that, ""No State shall . . .  pass any Bill of Attainder, ex post facto Law, or Law impairing the Obligation of Contracts . . ."" [Emphasis added]    Under the Supreme Court's Contracts Clause jurisprudence, the threshold inquiry is, ""whether the state law has, in fact, operated as a substantial impairment of a contractual relationship.""  Allied Structural Steel Co. v. Spannaus, 438 U.S. 234, 244 (1978).  ""This inquiry has three components:  whether there is a contractual relationship, whether a change in law impairs that contractual relationship, and whether the impairment is substantial.""  General Motors Corporation v. Romein, 503 U.S. 181, 186 (1992).   The Contracts Clause only applies to contracts that exist at the time of the law's passage.  Also, the Contracts Clause has been deemed to apply both to legislation or other government action, but not to court decisions.  The judiciary has the power to invalidate a contract without violating the Contracts Clause.  See Tidal Oil v. Flanagan, 263 U.S. 444 (1924).  In a case involving a private contract, the law or governmental action must substantially impair a pre-existing contractual relationship.  Once this hurdle is met, the government must demonstrate that the law imposes reasonable conditions appropriate to achieving a significant and legitimate public purpose.  Often, when faced with such an issue, the courts defer to the legislative judgment.  However, this does not prevent an independent investigation of the relevant factual situation.  This is probably far more than you wanted to know.....just wanted to give a quick overview on the subject.  Bottom line:  CPUC would be dumb to suspend retroactively, at least from a legal perspective.  On the other hand, when has brilliance been a hallmark of recent decisions from this Commission?

However, the chances for ultimate success are probably not real high.  Once we have made the showing that there has been a substantial interference with contracts (based on the elements listed in Dan's e-mail), which I think we can, then the burden shifts to the government to show there was a legitimate public purpose in passing the law. The law we are dealing with is AB X1, and in particular the suspension of direct access provision. The passage of the law and the suspension of direct access can probably meet the legitimate public purpose test. The question then comes down to whether the Commission's implementation of that law so as to suspend direct access retroactively is necessary to meet that legitimate public purpose.  Given the nature of the legislation and its purview in the regulatory arena, the court is likely to defer to the PUC.       -----Original Message----- From: Mara, Susan [mailto:Susan.J.Mara@ENRON.com] Sent: Tuesday, August 28, 2001 11:09 AM To: jbennett@gmssr.com Subject: FW: Retroactive Suspension - SDG&E's message   Here is Dan's e-mail -----Original Message----- From: Norman Plotkin [mailto:nplotkin@rcsis.com] Sent: Tuesday, August 28, 2001 9:46A M To: arem@electric.com Subject: FW: Retroactive Suspension - SDG&E's message     -----Original Message----- From: Dan Douglass [mailto:douglass@energyattorney.com] Sent: Wednesday, August 22, 2001 8:03 PM To: Weller, Andrea; arem@electric.com; 'Norman Plotkin' Subject: Re: Retroactive Suspension - SDG&E's message   It would be surprising if the Commission did what SDG&E is suggesting.

As you will see, both Frank and I are quoted (even though I explicitly requested that I not be quoted since I am not a spokesperson for coalition). Nevertheless, our messages are made pretty clear.  Also, I apologize for not sending this sooner - It was somehow overlooked in our daily searches for AReM coverage.  Erica Manuel Edelman Worldwide / Sacramento  916/442-2331 phone 916/447-8509 fax erica.manuel@edelman.com  Esp provider   Published Thursday, August 30, 2001 12:00:00 AM    By Mike Rappaport  Staff Writer  Frank Annunziato of Upland has been providing electric power to nearly 200 customers for about four years.  But if a draft decision by the California Public Utilities Commission is voted into effect next Thursday, Annunziato and 20 to 25 other members of the Alliance for Retail Energy Markets will take a hit.  The decision would prohibit electrical service providers like Annunizato from entering into new contracts to provide direct-access power to customers, and the revised version released Monday would take the original effective date of Sept. 1, 2001, and make it retroactive to July 1.  Electrical service providers purchase power from various sources - in Annunziato's case it's the excess from municipal power authorities - and sell that power to customers who would rather not buy from Southern California Edison.  ""That was one of the purposes of deregulation,"" Annunziato said. ""To open up the market and give people choices of where to buy their power.""  Annunziato's company, American Utility Network, services nearly 200 Southern California customers. He is able to provide low-cost power because he signed long-term contracts for power before prices skyrocketed. In the short term, a restriction on new contracts won't affect him.  ""I'm not taking on any new customers right now anyway,"" he said. ""I'm limited in the amount of power I have, and I'm pretty close to capacity.""  But not being able to renew those contracts - or to sign up other customers to replace those who would leave normally - will eventually put him out of business.  The Alliance for Retail Energy Markets is the lobbying group that represents Annunziato and other independent providers. AReM opposes the PUC draft decision and calls it ""an illegal act under the U.S. Constitution to abrogate existing contracts.""  ""This decision just came out of left field,"" said AReM spokeswoman Erica Manuel. ""They claim they need to do this to protect the state's ability to issue bonds, but it doesn't make sense. We certainly don't want retroactive suspensions and we will try to prevent any lengthy suspensions.""  As of July, independent providers had 60,000 residential customers, 6,800 commercial customers, 250 industrial customers and 350 agricultural customers across California, according to Manuel.  ""These are existing contracts,"" she said. ""At this point, if they try to negate existing contracts there will be a legal battle.""  Kyle DeVine at the PUC said Monday's announcement was only a draft decision and that nothing would happen before Sept. 6.  ""It has not taken effect,"" she said. ""All this is just part of the comments we're looking for.""

The Notice further indicated that this practice will be effective for the June, 2001 and subsequent preliminary invoices until the ISO issues a further Market Notice addressing cash distributions based on preliminary invoices. The ISO has determined that, effective for a temporary period beginning with the July 2001 trade month, it is appropriate not only to defer ISO cash distributions based on preliminary invoices but also to defer issuance of the preliminary invoices themselves.  Thus, the ISO will neither collect nor disperse funds until the final invoice is prepared and distributed. Beginning with the July 2001 trade month, and until the ISO issues a further Market Notice addressing preliminary invoices, the ISO will issue a single monthly invoice on the date that it issues the Final Settlement Statement for the last Trade Day of the calendar month.  The ISO intends to distribute market payments received based on this single invoice within five business days from the final payment date specified on the invoice. This suspension of the ""two invoice"" settlements approach is a temporary action which the ISO has determined it must take to address the problems created not only by recent large adjustments between preliminary and final invoices but also by Scheduling Coordinators that have failed to make full or timely payments on preliminary invoices due to unauthorized ""netting"" or other practices that are contrary to their payment obligations.  The ISO is considering how best to solve these problems permanently and will issue a subsequent Market Notice concerning this issue within two months. As noted in the August 30 Notice, the ISO will be filing Tariff revisions with FERC to reflect these changes.

Sent: Friday, September 07, 2001 4:34 PM To: Yoder, Christian; Comnes, Alan; Mara, Susan Subject: ""Independent"" ISO never sent bill to CDWR.  Calif DWR Hasn't Received Any Invoice From ISO For Power  Updated: Friday, September 7, 2001 05:57 PM ET  By Mark Golden  Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES  NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--The California Department of Water Resources has never received an invoice from the California Independent System Operator for power purchased on behalf of the state's insolvent utilities, DWR spokesman Oscar Hidalgo said Friday.  Between the middle of January, when Gov. Gray Davis ordered the DWR to start paying for ISO power purchases and May 31, the ISO has procured about $3.3 billion in power on behalf of California's cash-strapped utilities, PG&E Corp.'s (PCG </investments/quotes/?symbol=PCG>, news </investments/news/?symbol=PCG>, msgs </investments/discuss/?symbol=PCG>) Pacific Gas & Electric Co. and Edison International's (EIX </investments/quotes/?symbol=EIX>, news </investments/news/?symbol=EIX>, msgs </investments/discuss/?symbol=EIX>) Southern California Edison, according to the ISO.  None of that power has been paid for, according to the ISO, as previously reported. The ISO and DWR have been negotiating the procedure for settling the accounts, but sellers to the ISO have been complaining that it shouldn't take eight months for the state agencies to get payments flowing.  ""Until we get a bill that we can account for, we can't write a blank check and send it out. We haven't even received an improper bill,"" said Hidalgo.  The ISO was unable to comment immediately on whether it has sent a bill to the DWR for power purchased on behalf of the utilities. The ISO has said previously that it can't supply all the information the DWR wants without violating its own confidentiality rules.  The Independent Energy Producers Association, which represents many of the suppliers to the ISO, said this week the ISO market is on the verge of collapsing. Merchant power companies in California, such as Dynegy Inc. (DYN </investments/quotes/?symbol=DYN>, news </investments/news/?symbol=DYN>, msgs </investments/discuss/?symbol=DYN>) and Mirant Corp. (MIR </investments/quotes/?symbol=MIR>, news </investments/news/?symbol=MIR>, msgs </investments/discuss/?symbol=MIR>) continue to sell to the ISO, as ordered by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.  The ISO, which has ultimate responsibility for avoiding blackouts, ensures there is exactly the right amount of power on the state's transmission lines to meet demand at all times, which requires constant buying and selling of electricity.  In mid-January, after the state's two main utilities ran out of cash, an executive order from Davis - backed by state law passed in February - authorized the DWR to pay for any purchases the ISO needed to make for the utilities.  ""There is no bill. I don't know as a government agency how the process of payment for a significant amount of money - over $1 billion - would be in anybody's mind as a possibility,"" Hidalgo said.  The DWR, which has paid more than $9 billion for power it has bought from suppliers directly since January, has set aside money to pay for the ISO's last-minute purchases.  The ISO considers the entire $3.3 billion unpaid, though DWR operations chief Pete Garris said earlier this week that DWR may have paid a majority of that bill directly to power suppliers. The DWR has set aside about $1.25 billion to pay suppliers once it receives a detailed bill from the ISO that meets DWR requirements. Other procedural problems have prevented the DWR from making payment. The DWR wants to pay suppliers directly, which Garris said the ISO is uncomfortable with.  The ISO declined to discuss this direct-payment issue. ISO market rules require that buyers pay the ISO, which, in turn, pays sellers.  The FERC has ordered the ISO to stop buying power on behalf on parties that aren't creditworthy, specifically Pacific Gas & Electric Co. and Edison. PG&E has said that it continues to receive bills from the ISO, and has been told the bills are for informational purposes only.  -By Mark Golden, Dow Jones Newswires; 201-938-4604; mark.golden@dowjones.com <mailto:mark.golden@dowjones.com>    <Embedded Picture (Metafile)>","jeff.dasovich@enron.com, d..steffes@enron.com, j..kean@enron.com,   ray.alvarez@enron.com, linda.robertson@enron.com,   alan.comnes@enron.com, pr <.palmer@enron.com>",susan.mara@enron.com,"FW: ""Independent"" ISO never sent bill to CDWR.",2001-09-07 16:46:51-07:00,sent

There is access to federal courts because = the case will involve federal constitutional rights.  But going directly to=  federal court has its pitfalls.  First, the 11th amendment prevents naming=  the State (and presumably its subdivisions) as defendants.  This limitatio= n can be circumvented by naming individuals as the defendants (such as the = Attorney General who is the chief law enforcement officer) using Ex Parte Y= oung, 209 U.S. 123.  Second, the federal court will have wide discretion to=  abstain (this is known as a Pullman Abstention) from hearing the case in o= rder to allow the California courts to decide the California constitutional=  issues.  Third, the federal courts may conclude this is really a dispute o= ver rate making and require that state remedies be exhausted (28 USC 1342).=   There may be other pitfalls. =20 In our estimation, the federal courts would seek to abstain because the cas= e involves such important California legal and policy issues that the Legis= lature decided it was necessary to confer original and priority jurisdictio= n in the California Supreme Court.  This presents a tactical dilemma becaus= e of the risk of alienating the Supreme Court by first going to District Co= urt which then decides to abstain.  Also, it could create timing problems b= ecause relief must be sought from the Supreme Court no later than 30 days a= fter a rehearing application is denied by the Commission.  The District Cou= rt would probably take more than 30 days to decide whether to abstain, thus=  opening a new argument of timeliness when the state action is initiated. =20 This suggests the possibility of filing simultaneously in both courts.

"We will likely have seek a petition for rehearing first -- but ,if there is any question,we should try to be as agressive as the law may allow. -----Original Message----- From: Ed Duncan [mailto:EDuncan2@ArterHadden.com] Sent: Monday, September 10, 2001 12:58 PM To: Mara, Susan; JBennett@GMSSR.com Cc: Lin Meyer; douglass@energyattorney.com Subject: RE: Revised Petition and Points and Authorities   I am attaching the Joint Petition which assumes that a direct access customer joins Enron.   The draft is considerably improved over the draft sent yesterday but it does not take in the comments below.  These will be reviewed and integrated into the next draft.   I am very concerned about the exhaustion of remedies problem.  The jurisdictional statute is PUC section 1768(a).  This provision suggests that an aggrieved party must seek a rehearing before the PUC before seeking review by the Supreme Court.  A request for rehearing must be made within 15 days after the PUC acts, but there is no time within which the PUC must act.  If the PUC agreed to stay the Order, then it seems clear that a rehearing must be sought before applying to the Supreme Court.  If the PUC refuses the stay request, then there is a good argument that one of the exceptions to the exhaustion of remedies would apply.  This will require that one or all of the Petitioners request a stay by the PUC.  Douglass indicates that a stay would be unusual and that such requests normally are not made.  In this case, it is probably necessary to circumvent the exhaustion issue.  EWD    >>> JBennett <JBennett@GMSSR.com> 09/10/01 11:19AM >>>  Sue --  I have reviewed the Petition and associated Memorandum.  A couple of general comments:  1.  We make the point throughout (page 2 is the first time) that the Commission's action (retroactive suspension) will result in a windfall to the UDCs as they will be paid for services provided by Enron and other ESPs. It is not clear to me that we can make this argument.  The commission's order does not indicate that the ESPs have to pay the UDCs the amounts that they have received from their direct access customers for the past two months for energy procurement.  The commission could just as easily decide that although customers who entered into DA contracts after July 1 are no longer allowed to continue on DA, they will not go  back and undo transactions that have already occurred.  2.   In the section of the memorandum discussing why the petition is properly before the court (Section IV), we are discussing why an application for rehearing is unnecessary.  We state that in this case a rehearing would be superfluous and unnecessary as ""there are no new legal arguments and no additional evidence to be presented.""  Such argument appears to run counter to our contentions that because of the lack of hearing in this proceeding, the Commission's decision lacks the support it needs or, on the flip side, denied us the opportunity to put on evidence to show the suspension of direct access was unnecessary.  3.  In section VI. (e) of the Memorandum arguing that the impairment of contracts ordered by the Commission is not reasonable or appropriate, we state that the Commission's motive is not the announced purpose, that its purpose instead is malevolent as illustrated by the rhetoric directed at out of state energy  companies.  I don't think such an argument adds anything and, although it maybe true, at this stage it probably is not a good idea to assert that the Commission is purposely hurting the state to get back at the out of state energy companies.

Rush to beat direct-access purchase ban spurs fear By Ed Mendel  STAFF WRITER  September 12, 2001  SACRAMENTO -- Some utility customers, mainly businesses, are rushing to sign contracts with generators for cheaper power before regulators enact a long-delayed ban, raising concern that costs may go up for the remaining customers.  The state plans to ban ""direct access"" contracts with generators to keep customers with utilities in order to help pay for power bought by the state since January. Those state purchases will be covered in part by a $12.5 billion bond paid off by ratepayers over 15 years.  But many businesses, which say they need cheaper power now to remain competitive, are signing contracts to bypass the utilities before the Public Utilities Commission bans direct-access pacts, an action that could come as soon as tomorrow.  ""We have seen a significant increase in the last month,"" said Ed Van Herik, a spokesman for San Diego Gas & Electric Co.  He said the amount of the annual SDG&E power load shifted to direct-access contracts with generators increased from 10 percent at the end of July to 17.4 percent at the end of last month.  Allowing customers to shop around for cheaper power was the main promise of the state's failed attempt to deregulate electricity. But when the utilities ran up huge debts and could no longer borrow, the state began buying power for utility customers in January.  To avoid harming the economy with a massive rate increase, the state decided to spread out payment of the soaring cost of wholesale power by obtaining decade-long power contracts and issuing the $12.5 billion ratepayer bond.  Now the state wants customers to remain with the utilities for two reasons: paying their fair share of the state-subsidized power received earlier this year and preserving a ratepayer base large enough to pay off the long-term contracts and the bond.  The power provided by the state to utility customers looked like a bargain earlier this year, when prices on the wholesale market skyrocketed while the state raised rates for the customers of Pacific Gas and Electric Co. and Southern California Edison by about one-third.  The state has not raised rates for SDG&E customers. But an increase averaging 12 percent for SDG&E residential customers is on the PUC agenda tomorrow, along with several other actions that may be taken to pave the way for issuing the $12.5 billion ratepayer bond.  PUC President Loretta Lynch said that before wholesale power prices began soaring last year, about 16 percent of the power provided by the three investor-owned utilities was being bought through direct-access contracts. By last March, she said, the amount dropped to 1 percent.  ""Certainly, the direct access tanked because the marketers dumped their customers back on the utilities when the price rose last year,"" Lynch said.  But as wholesale power prices dropped in June, direct-access contracts began to look like a better deal, and a number of customers have left the utilities to get cheaper power.  At Southern California Edison, the number of customers with direct-access contracts grew from 32,547 on June 21 to 37,718 by the end of last month -- an increase of 5,171, said Steve Hansen, an Edison spokesman.  ""Now that the market has turned, everyone is bailing as fast as they can,"" said Mike Florio of The Utility Reform Network, a San Francisco-based consumer group.  Most of the electricity obtained through direct-access contracts in recent months apparently has been bought by businesses that use large amounts of electricity.  ""Most of the providers which serve small customers have simply stopped doing business in the state,"" said PUC Commissioner Carl Wood, who with Lynch outlined the PUC's proposed actions at a Capitol news conference late last month.  The PUC delayed action to ban direct-access contracts, waiting for the Legislature to act on proposals that would have allowed businesses to bypass the utilities if they paid an ""exit fee"" to cover their share of state-subsidized power.  The ban on direct-access contracts originally proposed by the PUC would have been retroactive to July 1. But the retroactive provision was reportedly dropped after a lawsuit was threatened by the Alliance for Retail Energy Markets, a group of power marketers.  In the Legislature, a provision allowing utility customers to obtain direct-access contracts beginning in 2003, if they pay exit fees, was added to the Assembly version of a plan passed last week to keep Edison from joining PG&E in bankruptcy.  The addition of the direct-access provision is one reason that the Assembly version of the Edison plan is supported by the California Chamber of Commerce. But the Assembly plan pushed by Gov. Gray Davis faces opposition in the Senate.  Senate President Pro Tempore John Burton, D-San Francisco, said the Senate would send an Edison bill back to the Assembly after making it a ""less-egregious giveaway"" to the utility.  The main provision in the Assembly plan would allow Edison to eliminate most of its debt by issuing $2.9 billion in bonds that would be paid off by ratepayers.  The Foundation for Consumer and Taxpayer Rights, a consumer group in Santa Monica, calls the Edison plan a ""bailout"" and is threatening to place a measure on the ballot that would ask voters to overturn the plan should it be approved by the Legislature and governor.  And TURN, the San Francisco consumer group, says the Assembly version of the Edison rescue plan is more generous to the utility than a tougher plan approved by the Senate in July and giving Edison an additional $1.8 billion.  The consumer group also says the direct-access provision in the Assembly's Edison plan has ""major loopholes"" that would allow large customers to leave the utilities without paying their fair share of state power costs.  ""TURN opposes the reintroduction of direct access, because any 'savings' that are claimed to occur are really nothing more than the result of cost shifting to those who do not or cannot abandon utility service,"" the consumer group said in a statement.

"  From additional conversations with the Ed Duncan and Mike Day --   It looks as if WE ARE REQUIRED TO SEEK A STAY/REQUEST FOR REHEARING FROM THE CPUC BEFORE WE CAN FILE WITH THE COURTS.    We also have to include ALL our points in the CPUC filing or we CANNOT bring them up with the courts.

SueMara (415) 782-7802          -----Original Message----- From: Ed Duncan [mailto:EDuncan2@ArterHadden.com] Sent: Monday, September 10, 2001 12:58 PM To: Mara, Susan; JBennett@GMSSR.com Cc: Lin Meyer; douglass@energyattorney.com Subject: RE: Revised Petition and Points and Authorities   I am attaching the Joint Petition which assumes that a direct access customer joins Enron.   The draft is considerably improved over the draft sent yesterday but it does not take in the comments below.  These will be reviewed and integrated into the next draft.   I am very concerned about the exhaustion of remedies problem.  The jurisdictional statute is PUC section 1768(a).  This provision suggests that an aggrieved party must seek a rehearing before the PUC before seeking review by the Supreme Court.  A request for rehearing must be made within 15 days after the PUC acts, but there is no time within which the PUC must act.  If the PUC agreed to stay the Order, then it seems clear that a rehearing must be sought before applying to the Supreme Court.  If the PUC refuses the stay request, then there is a good argument that one of the exceptions to the exhaustion of remedies would apply.  This will require that one or all of the Petitioners request a stay by the PUC.  Douglass indicates that a stay would be unusual and that such requests normally are not made.  In this case, it is probably necessary to circumvent the exhaustion issue.  EWD    >>> JBennett <JBennett@GMSSR.com> 09/10/01 11:19AM >>>  Sue --  I have reviewed the Petition and associated Memorandum.  A couple of general comments:  1.  We make the point throughout (page 2 is the first time) that the Commission's action (retroactive suspension) will result in a windfall to the UDCs as they will be paid for services provided by Enron and other ESPs. It is not clear to me that we can make this argument.  The commission's order does not indicate that the ESPs have to pay the UDCs the amounts that they have received from their direct access customers for the past two months for energy procurement.  The commission could just as easily decide that although customers who entered into DA contracts after July 1 are no longer allowed to continue on DA, they will not go  back and undo transactions that have already occurred.  2.   In the section of the memorandum discussing why the petition is properly before the court (Section IV), we are discussing why an application for rehearing is unnecessary.  We state that in this case a rehearing would be superfluous and unnecessary as ""there are no new legal arguments and no additional evidence to be presented.""  Such argument appears to run counter to our contentions that because of the lack of hearing in this proceeding, the Commission's decision lacks the support it needs or, on the flip side, denied us the opportunity to put on evidence to show the suspension of direct access was unnecessary.  3.  In section VI. (e) of the Memorandum arguing that the impairment of contracts ordered by the Commission is not reasonable or appropriate, we state that the Commission's motive is not the announced purpose, that its purpose instead is malevolent as illustrated by the rhetoric directed at out of state energy  companies.  I don't think such an argument adds anything and, although it maybe true, at this stage it probably is not a good idea to assert that the Commission is purposely hurting the state to get back at the out of state energy companies.

" As of this point in time, the CPUC is NOT expected to vote tomorrow. The CPUC has not said when a new meeting would be held.

As part of that filing, we would need to include all of  the points we would raise in the court and declarations from each individual aggrieved party.   The decalarations would be held completely confidential by the attorney, transmitted directly through our outside attorney and would be filed under protective seal at the Commission.

Our strategy is similar if the Legislature enacts a law with a retroactive date.  The major differences are that we would go directly to court and we would have to wait until the bill was signed by the Governor.

The TURN approach is totally unacceptable and we should oppose, in our view.  I will also forward this to the CLECA members for their review.  Here are some of things wrong witih the TURN approach: * The suspension of DA is retroactive to July 1, 2001.   * All of the language we had in subsection (h) regarding treatment of continuous DA customers has been removed and replaced with a very limited exemption for plants on the site of the customer. * Any customer who was a bundled customer for even a day is responsible for the full panoply of exit fees. * The DWR forward exit fee is calculated simply as the difference between the DWR portfolio cost, say 10 cents, and the cost of contracts in the market at the time of the determination, say 4.5 cents today.  There is no look at net short.  Each DA customer would be assessed the 5.5 cents in my example, plus DWR historical and Edison undercollection fees.  A total of 6.5 to 7 cents in my example.  Ts makes DA totally uneconomic.  Further, in assessing the DWR portfolio cost we are to look at the minimum purchase levels, thereby raising the per kWh cost due to demand costs. * Finally, the language adds to the CPUC's rules on coming back to bundled service, including the provision of notice by the customer before it returns.  And it adds language authorizing the CPUC to adopt reg's for DA after the utility takes over the net short purchase obligations from the DWR.  This is really bad language in my view.  As we discussed yesterday, it makes DA uneconomic.  I think we should oppose it. I heard from Derek Naten, SVMG's lobbyist, just now.  He informs that Rick Simposn and Lawrence Lingbloom say the Edsion undercollection cut point will move up to 125 kW.  Rick told him that DA is out of the bill entirely. Lawrence told him that DA will be adressed in a bill under Debra Bowen's control, and that Debra had a good proposal all along and that the business guys had screwed it up.   Are we making progress?    Bill",jeff.dasovich@enron.com,susan.mara@enron.com,FW: SB 78 -- The Latest from Sacramento - CLECA Report,2001-09-12 16:44:50-07:00,sent

The provider declaration focuses on :  (1) lost jobs, (2) forfeited /terminated direct access contracts, and (3) avoidable damage claims.

However, the magnitude of the potential losses will be compelling as they cumulate.    I would like your imput for other areas of injury  a provider can anticipate.

"About 1 AM this morning, the Legislature adjourned -- the Senate without voting out the Edison MOU (which included DA provisions) and the Assembly without passing out Bowen's green DA bill.  On the SCE MOU, Governor Davis responded by saying 1) the Assembly did a good job, 2) the Senate failed to do its job and 3) Davis would call a special session to start all over again and try to get an MOU. The special session would begin in about 2 weeks.  Davis said that Edison promised him they wouldn't take themselves into voluntary bankruptcy in the interim.

California Senate adjourns without voting on plan to save struggling utility  JENNIFER KERR, Associated Press Writer Saturday, September 15, 2001  ?2001 Associated Press  URL: <http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/news/archive/2001/09/15/national0541EDT0485.DTL> (09-15) 02:57 PDT SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) --  The state Senate adjourned early Saturday without voting on a plan to rescue Southern California Edison from bankruptcy, and Gov. Gray Davis called an emergency legislative session for next month to try again to help the struggling utility.  As the California Legislature rushed to pass hundreds of bills and finish the 2001 session, a $200 million program to help the state's neediest schools won approval. So did bills to give driver's licenses to immigrants seeking citizenship and improve working conditions for shepherds.  But senators remained cool to Davis' idea of bailing out Southern California Edison. They failed to vote on the measure after it was approved last week by the Assembly, which also adjourned early Saturday.  ""We didn't take it up because we didn't want to embarrass the governor,"" said President Pro Tem John Burton. ""It would have been a rip-off of residential people to help big business and bail out a corporation.""  The deal's quiet death closed more than five months of work since Davis first announced the plan in April, saying the state would pay $2.76 billion for Edison's transmission system and let the utility sell consumer-backed bonds to repay the rest of its $3.9 billion debt.  Without the deal, Edison faces bankruptcy along with Pacific Gas and Electric Co., the state's largest utility. The company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in April, after amassing about $8.9 billion in debt due to last year's sky-high electricity costs. Edison says it has accrued $3.9 billion in debts.  The special session is meant to take another shot at saving Edison from sliding into bankruptcy.  ""I am proud of the work done by the Assembly to get the state out of the business of buying electricity by restoring Edison to creditworthiness,"" Davis in a statement after midnight Saturday. ""Unfortunately, however, the Senate has not gotten the job done.""  The new school-improvement program would provide grants of $400 per student to schools with the state's lowest test scores. They will have nearly four years to improve scores or face sanctions as severe as closing the school.  The shepherd bill would give people who watch sheep some of the basic working conditions that other workers have in state law. Those include a 10-minute rest break for every four hours of work, tools paid for by the employer and toilets, lights and water in housing.  It also would put into state law a $1,050-a-month minimum wage for sheepherders.  While legislators toiled, Tuesday's terrorist attacks were never far from their minds.  Davis joined the Assembly for a brief memorial service that included a procession of lawmakers handing in letters they had written expressing their feeling about the attacks.  The Legislature approved sending $1 million from the California Victim Compensation fund to a similar program in New York to help victims of the terrorist attacks.  The letters will be printed in a special Assembly Journal.  ""Here in California, our job is to keep the peace and preach tolerance,"" said Davis.  ?2001 Associated Press       ","mark.reese@enron.com, lamar.frazier@enron.com, edward.hamb@enron.com,

"Nancy,  As we discussed,  the current proposed decision does not provide any date for closing off DASRs.  Rather, it would end the right to choose (direct access).  If direct access is suspended by the CPUC, DASRs should continue to be accepted by utilities for DASRs related to contracts signed before the suspension date.  SDG&E has already told some ESPs that it does not plan to police the contracts and will continue to accept DASRs as long as necessary. To be safe, we must be move as quickly as possible to get all our DASRs in.  The CPUC will be meeting this Thursday and is scheduled to vote on suspending DA. We can't predict the outcome; the vote could be delayed again, leaving us uncertain as to whether or when DA will be suspended.   -----Original Message----- From:  Hetrick, Nancy   Sent: Monday, September 17, 2001 9:32 AM To: Mara, Susan; Dasovich, Jeff Cc: Gresch, Robert Subject: FW: CSC DASR Bandwidth, and Utility Deadlines  Is there someone on the California ""Crisis"" Team that can answer this question?   -----Original Message----- From:  Gresch, Robert   Sent: Monday, September 10, 2001 5:43 PM To: Hetrick, Nancy Subject: CSC DASR Bandwidth, and Utility Deadlines  Nancy, when we went through our last big DASR emergency week before last, the question was raised as to what was the effective date of a DASR, e.g., is it midnight of the day that you've submitted it, or if the utility picks up the information from their file server at 5:00 p.m. (SoCal) is does that determine the effective date such that anything submitted later would have an effective date of the following day?

"Done without much fanfare, except by Commissoner Wood, who continued his vitriolic attack on DA and took on green choice as ""fraudulent."" The language in the order says no more DA contracts can be entered into after today. The order directs the utilities to police the DASRs to make sure that none are submitted for contracts signed after today.  There is some strange language that talks about a possible future order to address the comments raised by the parties and putting parties ""on notice"" that, in this future order, they may suspend all direct access contracts signed on or after July 1, 2001.

The plan involves a restructuring of the Pacific Gas and Electric Company business and a refinancing of our assets.  As noted in our press release, the plan has the full support of the creditor's committee.  Following is the press release we issued this morning.  Further information and a copy of the Plan of Reorganization is -- or soon will be -- available at www.pge.com.  I am sending this message simply for your information, not because of any expected effect on the Direct Access program. I expect that you will continue to work with essentially the same people and work groups after the transition as before.  Also, recognize that this is a long process, which w= e hope will be complete by January 2003.  You can follow major events in our pursuit of approval and consummation of this plan on our web site. We believe the completion of this plan will resolve creditors' valid claims and maintain stability for our customers an= d employees, as well as provide long-term benefits to the state.   If you have questions, please do not hesitate to call Calvin Yee @ (415/973-5683) or Michael Alexander @ (415/973-2932)  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------= - ---------------------------------------------------------------------------= - -------------------------  Pacific Gas and Electric Company and PG&E Corporation File Plan of Reorganization Plan Pays Claims in Full, Does Not Call for Retail Rate Increases or State Bailout (San Francisco, CA) - PG&E Corporation (NYSE: PCG) and its utility unit Pacific Gas and Electric Company jointly filed a Plan of Reorganization in U.S. Bankruptcy Court today that enables Pacific Gas and Electric Company t= o pay all valid creditor claims in full and emerge from Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings. The official creditors' committee supports the plan. ""This plan is an achievable solution that will enable Pacific Gas and Electric Company to move out of Chapter 11 as a financially strong business positioned to continue safe, reliable and responsive delivery of gas and electricity to its customers, pay all valid creditor claims in full, and do so without asking for a rate increase or a state bailout,"" said Robert D. Glynn, Jr., Chairman of Pacific Gas and Electric Company and Chairman, CEO and President of PG&E Corporation. ""And, the plan will enable us to provide long-term growth prospects to shareholders."" The plan reorganizes Pacific Gas and Electric Company and PG&E Corporation into two separate, stand-alone companies no longer affiliated with one another. The reorganized Pacific Gas and Electric Company will continue to own and operate the existing retail electric and natural gas distribution system. The electric generation, electric transmission, and natural gas transmission operations currently under Pacific Gas and Electric Company will be part of PG&E Corporation. The common shares of the reorganized Pacific Gas and Electric will be distributed to PG&E Corporation shareholders. The electric generation, electric transmission and gas transmission operations, when reorganized as new businesses under PG&E Corporation, will have the ability to issue debt that will be combined with new financing at Pacific Gas and Electric and used to help pay creditors' claims. The plan also restructures certain existing debt and uses $3.3 billion in cash on hand to satisfy creditor claims. Under the plan, all valid creditor claims will be paid in full, using a combination of cash and long-term notes. In total, the plan will provide creditors with about $9.1 billion in cash and $4.1 billion in notes. The vast majority of creditors-those with allowed claims of $100,000 or less-will receive cash payments for the full amount of their allowed claims on the effective date of the plan. Most secured creditors will also receive 100 percent of their allowed claims in cash. Finally, unsecured creditors with allowed claims in excess of the $100,000 threshold will be paid 60 percent in cash and 40 percent in notes. Following the restructuring, Pacific Gas and Electric Company and PG&E Corporation will be organized as follows: *=09Pacific Gas and Electric Company will be a separate California corporation focused on providing electric and natural gas distribution service to its customers in Northern and Central California. It will hold 7= 0 percent of the current utility assets (in terms of book value) and will employ 16,000 people. Pacific Gas and Electric Company will continue to provide the full range of utility services to one out of every 20 Americans= .  *=09PG&E Corporation, in addition to its existing National Energy Group business, will have three new businesses that will own and operate the electric generation, electric transmission and gas transmission operations formerly under Pacific Gas and Electric Company. The new electric generation business will be a California company established to own and operate the hydroelectric and nuclear generation assets and associated lands, and to assume the power contracts with irrigation districts, now held by the utility. In total, the unit will have approximately 7,100 megawatts of generation. The facilities will be operate= d in accordance with all current FERC and Nuclear Regulatory Commission licenses, and in keeping with sound environmental stewardship policies. The generating business will sell its power back to the reorganized Pacific Gas and Electric Company under a 12-year contract at a stable, market-based rate. The new electric transmission business will be a California company established to own and operate the transmission system currently operated b= y the utility. The system comprises 18,500 circuit miles of electric transmission lines and cables. The new gas transmission business will be a California company established to own and operate the natural gas transmission assets currently operated b= y the utility, including 6,300 miles of transmission pipelines and three gas storage facilities. Following the reorganization, the California Public Utilities Commission will continue to regulate the reorganized Pacific Gas and Electric Company, including retail electric and natural gas rates. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) will continue to have jurisdiction over the licenses for the hydroelectric assets, and the rates, terms and conditions of service provided by the electric transmission business. FERC will also assume jurisdiction over rates for the power generated by the Diablo Canyon Nuclear Power Plant, and over the rates, terms and conditions of service fo= r the gas transmission system, which will become an interstate pipeline. Glynn said, ""This plan, without raising retail rates, provides a safe, reliable and long-term electric supply to California customers. It enables our company to maintain a qualified workforce. And it enables us to keep ou= r generating assets intact and integrated, rather than selling them piecemeal to pay creditors."" The company expects that roles and responsibilities for the vast majority o= f its workforce will be unaffected by the plan. The reorganized Pacific Gas and Electric Company and the newly established entities will employ essentially the same people who operate the various assets under the curren= t organization. ""We envision essentially the same experienced, dedicated team continuing to do their jobs with a comparable level of pay and benefits programs,"" said Glynn. ""We believe these businesses should be operated and maintained by th= e people who know how to run them best."" In addition to resolving creditors' claims and maintaining stability for customers and employees, the plan also provides long-term benefits to the state. It provides the state with a path to exit the business of buying power for customers, by identifying conditions under which Pacific Gas and Electric Company would be financially able to re-assume the procurement responsibility that is currently being fulfilled by the state Department of Water Resources. The Chapter 11 process requires that the plan of reorganization ultimately be confirmed by the Bankruptcy Court before it can be implemented. Paul Aronzon, legal counsel for the Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors, said ""This plan provides a comprehensive and responsible framework to resolve creditors' claims and restore PG&E's creditworthiness. It has our full support, and we look forward to an expeditious resolution o= f the Chapter 11 process."" ""With this plan filed,"" said Glynn, ""we are now focused on bringing the Chapter 11 process to completion, reaffirming the financial health and creditworthiness of our operations through this reorganization, restoring customers' confidence, and rebuilding value for our shareholders."" --PG&E News   Calvin Yee Sr. Account Manager, Beale, MC B19C San Francisco, CA 94105 phone: 415-973-5683; fax: 415-973-8494",jeff.dasovich@enron.com,susan.mara@enron.com,FW: PG&E's Plan of Reorganization under the Chapter 11 bankruptcy  pro cess,2001-09-20 16:32:35-07:00,sent
"Susan,  I am pleased that the PUC demonstrated some level of propriety and common sense by not acting in a retroactive manner on direct access.  Accordingly, we are placing our work in abeyance pending further instruction.  If any party is interested in litigating further the direct access decision from September 20, it will be necessary to petition for rehearing at the PUC.  An aggrieved party will only be able to go to court if the PUC denies the petition for rehearing or upholds its original decision following rehearing.  The grounds for judicial review now appear to be limited to (1) denial of procedural due process and (2) PUC conduct contrary to law.  This latter argument is based on a statutory duty to hold hearings when deciding whether to change a policy originally decided following hearings.  Unlike the problems caused by a retroactive decision, there is probably no basis for a stay pending final decision.  The attached petition is the most recent generation and has fairly accurate tables of authorities and content.  It does not have the two most recent developments (the statement by the Department of Finance indicating that bonds may not be necessary and the argument that there was a statutory duty to conduct hearings).  If this petition is revived, those arguments can be quickly inserted.  I have also retained all comments so those will be available if the petition is revived.

The primary reasons cited for why rehearing should be granted are as follows:    The Decision violates procedural due process guarantees.  The failure to hold hearings violates Public Utilities Code section 1708.5(f).   The Commission's reliance on material outside the record violates due process.   The Decision violates the Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution.   The threatened retroactivity is contrary to law and in excess of the Commission's authority.

I also attach the draft filing -- Bob Williams and Mike Smith and I are meeting this afternoon (4 pm ) Houston time to see if there are any EES legal issues with it -- so don't release the full draft until you hear from me.  Sue Mara  (415) 782-7802 --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- CPUC SUSPENDS DIRECT ACCESS -- TAKE ACTION What Did the CPUC Do:   The CPUC voted at its meeting on September 20, 2001 to suspend direct access immediate. Included in the order is reference to a subsequent order that would address additional issues. The order also put everyone ""on notice"" that the Commission could modify the order later to suspend direct access retroactively to July 1, 2001. What Action is Required:  Many believe that the CPUC did not have valid reasons for suspending direct access and has no right to abrogate contracts retroctively, as it has threatened.  Consequently, concerned customers and energy service providers are preparing a Request for Rehearing that must be filed with the CPUC by Friday, September 28, 2001.  The Legislature enacted a special statute governing this and related decisions.  This first step is required by that statute.  If the CPUC denies the request (as expected), the next step would be a direct appeal to the State Supreme Court, which is also required by that same statute. What Will The Request for Rehearing Include:  A Request for Rehearing must raise the errors of law made by the CPUC in its order. The attorney for the Alliance for Retail Energy Markets (AReM) has prepared a draft. The primary reasons cited for why rehearing should be granted are as follows:  The Decision violates procedural due process guarantees.  The failure to hold hearings violates Public Utilities Code section 1708.5(f).  The Commission's reliance on material outside the record violates due process.  The Decision violates the Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution.  The threatened retroactivity is contrary to law and in excess of the Commission's authority.  The Commission acted contrary to law and in excess of its authority.  The Decision's purported findings are not supported.  The Commission has impermissibly converted a ratemaking proceeding into a quasi-legislative proceeding.

State subpoenas 16 energy officials   Senate investigating decisions that led to lifting limits on electricity prices   Mark Martin, Chronicle Staff Writer Thursday, September 27, 2001  ?2001 San Francisco Chronicle   URL: http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2001/09/27/MN227803.DTL    A state Senate committee began delivering subpoenas yesterday to 16 California energy officials to determine whether they colluded to manipulate the state's dysfunctional power market.   The probe will focus on decisions made last December that led federal regulators to lift limits on the price of electricity and sent costs skyrocketing, said state Sen. Joseph Dunn, D-Santa Ana.   Dunn wants to know why Terry Winter, the man in charge of the state's power grid, defied his board of directors and Gov. Gray Davis when he asked federal regulators to remove key price caps.   A spokesman for Winter said that the limits were causing energy producers to abandon California and that Winter acted to keep the state from plunging into darkness.   But with the price ceilings eliminated, energy prices soared and California's three electricity utilities began tumbling toward insolvency -- forcing the state to begin buying power with taxpayer dollars, according to Dunn.   ""The way things unfolded in December are very suspicious, and they directly led to the disaster that struck in January,"" said Dunn, chairman of a special Senate committee investigating energy market manipulation.   Winter, who is president and chief executive officer of the Independent System Operator, and 15 others will be required to provide sworn testimony in depositions. They also must provide e-mail messages, notes and phone records.   The others facing subpoenas include high-level ISO management officials and current and former board members.   The ISO board, which had members who worked for energy producers, was accused by many of being too cozy with power providers and was replaced in January by a five-member panel appointed by Davis.   Dunn hopes to retrace events surrounding some of the peak days of the state's energy crisis.   The ISO board had throughout the year lowered the limits at which energy producers could sell power. Price controls that were set at $750 per megawatt were reduced dramatically by October.   But soaring natural gas prices greatly increased the costs of producing electricity, and by the end of the month, generators sent a flurry of letters to the Federal Energy Commission urging an end to price limits.   By December, electricity producers were not interested in selling power to California utilities at rates that meant they would lose money, said Gregg Fishman, an ISO spokesman.   ""The market was completely dysfunctional at that point,"" Fishman said. ""There was no energy being bid. We're supposed to keep the lights on, so something had to be done.""   On Friday, Dec. 8, without telling ISO board members or the governor, Winter and other top ISO managers sent a 50-page request to Federal Energy Regulatory Commission officials asking that they make an emergency ruling and drop price caps. The commission, which had outlined a plan in November to end the price limits, approved the request.   Generators were allowed to charge more than $250 per megawatt as long as they could prove their costs.   Average prices the utilities paid for electricity shot up from $484 per megawatt on Dec. 5 to $677 per megawatt on Dec. 11. Less than a month later, the state began buying power for cash-strapped utilities, which couldn't afford the high prices.   ""They (ISO officials) poured gasoline on a fire,"" said Steve Maviglio, the governor's spokesman.   Although Winter, who serves at the pleasure of the board, was acting within ISO rules during an emergency, the governor and some power grid board members were outraged at the behind-the-scenes maneuvering. Dunn wants to know whether the ISO and energy producers campaigned together to eliminate the price limits.   ""I was appalled we weren't consulted about something so significant,"" said Michael Florio, a consumer advocate who sits on the ISO board. ""It was bad judgment at the very least.""   Florio, one of those subpoenaed by Dunn's committee, said the ISO board met the next week to discuss Winter's actions, but he said a majority of board members didn't want to get rid of the president of the power grid in the middle of a crisis.     -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Subpoenaed  The 16 people subpoenaed in the state Senate investigation of energy market manipulation are:    STAFF MEMBERS: Terry Winter, ISO president and chief executive officer   Kellan Fluckiger, ISO chief operations officer   Anjali Sheffrin, ISO director of market analysis   Jim Detmers, ISO vice president of grid operations   Elena Schmid, ISO vice president of corporate and strategic development    FORMER ISO BOARD MEMBERS Barbara Barkovich   Gregory Blue   John Fielder   Michael Florio, still serves   Karen Johanson   Carolyn Kehrein   Jan Smutny-Jones   V.

September 26, 2001  By KIMBERLY KINDY The Orange County Register    SACRAMENTOA state Senate committee is set today to start serving 16 subpoenas on electricity producers and officials who manage California's energy grid to determine whether they acted in concert to manipulate energy prices. T  he investigative committee, headed by state Sen. Joe Dunn, D-Santa Ana, is focusing on a series of events last fall filled with enough Shakespearean plot twists and intrigue that it has earned a name around the Capitol: ""the palace coup.""  Lawmakers and consumer groups allege that the events - directed by the man who heads the state's energy grid - fueled the California energy crisis, pushed the state into the power-buying business and helped make billions of dollars for power producers.  The central question behind the palace coup is whether Terry Winter, the president of the Independent System Operator, acted alone when he took steps to remove key price caps designed to limit the amount power generators could charge.  Winter defied his own board and Gov. Gray Davis when he filed a 50-page request to remove the caps, records and interviews show.  ""I don't know how these events could have taken place without some concerted effort,"" said Dunn.  The subpoenas will force those involved, including Winter, to provide sworn testimony about the events to the committee, and to turn over e-mails, personal calendars and memos.  Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio said the governor felt ""betrayed"" by the actions of Winter.  ""The governor believes it was the defining moment, when what was a mounting problem turned into an instant crisis,"" Maviglio said.  Winter refused comment, referring all questions to the public relations office. ISO spokesman Gregg Fishman said Dunn's committee will find no criminal conduct. The decision was made by ISO upper management with one goal in mind: to keep the lights on. At the time, generators were refusing to sell power in California because of the price caps.   ""It was an emergency,"" Fishman said.  ""We had to take action.''   What became known as the palace coup began on Oct. 26 when ISO board members voted for severe restrictions on the amount of money electricity producers could charge for power. The restrictions would drive prices as low as $65 per megawatt - nearly 12 times below the $750 per megawatt limits of seven months earlier.   ""They (electricity generators) grinned and beared the $750 price cap, but this new plan by ISO was too much,"" said Dunn, whose committee has been investigating since March.  ""All hell broke loose.''  Records show that on Oct. 31, power generators and electricity traders filed letters with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, demanding that the new plan be killed. The letters, six in all, were sent within two hours of each other and represented dozens of power generators.  ""If not removed immediately, the (ISO) price cap will sow confusion in the market, threaten reliability and stifle new investment in generating capacity,'' read one letter written by Duke Energy Vice President William Hall III.  Although there is nothing illegal about the generators acting together to lobby against price caps, Dunn believes the letters and other actions around the same time showed clear coordination among energy officials. He said the main aim of the subpoenas will be to determine whether collusion occurred to ""fix"" prices, which would violate federal trade laws.  In the Oct. 31 letters, electricity producers told federal officials that if price caps weren't removed it would lead to a collapse of the energy market.  The generators got their way.  The next day, the federal commission killed the new pricing plan. What was left in place was a $250 price cap established five months earlier.  Power producers then turned their attention toward killing that cap, saying they couldn't make a profit even under these constraints.   They began to withhold power from California, and on Dec. 7 the ISO declared its first Stage 3 emergency and braced for blackouts, which were narrowly averted.   What followed the next day is considered by the governor and Dunn to be the pivotal moment of the energy crisis.  Winter, who in his position as president and chief operating officer of the ISO, submitted a 50-page emergency request, asking federal officials to abolish the $250 price cap. Final authority over lifting the cap rested with the federal government.   Neither the ISO board, which had established the price cap, nor the governor learned of Winter's actions until the cap had been removed. In fact, the attorney who helped draft the emergency request, Charles Robinson, was in a meeting with representatives of the governor and ISO board members just hours before the filing was made. He didn't mention anything about it.  ""In retrospect, we should have told them,'' Robinson said.   With the price caps gone, the generators filed paperwork with federal regulators justifying higher costs.  ""The ISO staff sat in a meeting with the governor's key energy advisers with poker faces, not saying a word about something that was going on at the exact same moment,'' Maviglio said. ""It was beyond belief that they failed to mention something so significant. This action accelerated the utilities' move toward bankruptcy and forced the governor to move the state into the power-buying business.""   Prices for electricity jumped from an average of $249 a megawatt to $700 a megawatt within three days, ISO records show.  Dunn believes the resulting overcharges for electricity exceeded $30 billion.  Robinson said the filing - granted two hours after the request - helped rather than hurt Californians. Prices, he said, did not spike as a result. Instead they followed the skyrocketing price of natural gas - which is used to run power plants to generate electricity.  Robinson said the emergency order allowed the ISO to secure refunds should overcharges for electricity be proven to federal officials.  ""We believe the action we took addressed a severe concern,'' Robinson said. ""In our view, we did not believe we changed or made worse the financial situation. We felt we made it better because it introduced a process for review and refund.""   Jan Smutney-Jones, who was the ISO board chairman at the time and executive director of a group that represents power generators, said Winter did not consult him about eliminating the price cap. Smutney-Jones also said he was unaware of anyone in the power-generating community being consulted.  ""Terry did this by himself,'' said Smutney-Jones, executive director of the Independent Energy Producers.  ""He did what he thought had to be done at the time to keep the power flowing.""  The ISO board called an emergency meeting the next week demanding Winter explain his actions. Some board members pushed to have Winter removed, but there were concerns such action would lead to more chaos, the governor's spokesman Maviglio said.  James J. Hoecker, the former Federal Energy Regulatory Commission chairman, defended making the December decision and also defended Winter.  ""They filed an emergency motion, and we were not about to let California go dark,'' Hoecker said.   ""They (ISO management) did what any independent system operator would do.""  What Dunn's committee hopes to learn is why all these events transpired. He believes memos and e-mails around the time of Winter's Dec. 8 actions should provide vital clues.  ""We don't know why he did what he did, but we are eager to find out,"" Dunn said. ""Terry said he made that filing in the interest of Californians, but I find that argument has no basis in fact.''",susan.mara@enron.com,jeff.dasovich@enron.com,"RE: Probing the 'palace coup' --   or ""eating their own""",2001-09-27 08:53:19-07:00,received

Calif. power bond delay may lead to large deficit   NEW YORK, Sept 27 (Reuters) - California state Treasurer Philip Angelides said Thursday the state could face a $9.3 billion budget deficit in the 2002-2003 fiscal year if $12.5 billion of power bonds are not sold before July 2002.   The treasurer is certain the bonds will be sold, but he released the figures in an attempt to pressure the California Public Utilities Commission (PUC) into actions it must take in order to sell the bonds.   ""What I am concerned about is the fact this law has not been effectuated eight months after it was passed,"" Angelides said in a telephone news conference in Sacramento, referring to a law passed in February setting the biggest municipal bond sale ever in motion.   The state depleted its general fund by at least $6.2 billion buying electricity to keep power flowing and must sell the bonds in order to refill the state's general fund and make future power purchases.   ""There can be no schedule (for the bond sale) until the PUC completes its work,"" Angelides said.   Earlier this week the PUC said the much-delayed meeting is now set for Oct. 2.   Angelides said PUC Commissioner Jeff Brown, one of five, is on board to make the vote, but President Loretta Lynch and other commissioners, ""are not ready to act.""   Lynch said earlier this week that she wants more time to work out details with Angelides and the Department of Water Resources concerning the money and terms of the rate order and rate agreement.   How the money from rate increases approved in May will be split up to pay for the bonds and to reimburse troubled power utilities and giving the Department of Water Resources the authority to sell the bonds, still need to be decided by the PUC.   Angelides is projecting a $3.1 billion budget deficit for the 2002-2003 fiscal year, even if the bonds are sold in time, due to reduced revenues as the overall U.S. economy slows.   In a worst case scenario, Angelides added that with the bond sale, the $3.1 billion gap may grow to $4 billion, while a late sale would push the $9.3 billion number to $10.2 billion.   The treasurer painted a dire picture of California 's budget if the bonds are not sold, likening it to the state's budget problems of the early 1990s.   Angelides warned a 2 percent sales tax increase might have to be put in place, or possibly a $1,574 per student cut in state K-12 education spending.   Or, the state could drop all spending on the University of California and California State University and save $6 billion.   Eighteen percent of the state's non-education budget would need to be cut if the bonds are not sold, he said.        State cautioned on reliance on natural gas   SACRAMENTO -- California could face another energy crisis by relying too heavily on new natural gas-fired plants to boost electricity production, said the author of a study released yesterday.   After a year of volatile natural gas prices, the state shouldn't depend too much on gas and should instead invest more in renewable energy, according to ""Predictably Unpredictable,"" a study by the California Public Interest Research Group.   ""By putting all of our eggs in one basket, California is setting itself up for another energy crisis,"" said Susanna Churchill of CalPIRG.   Even before the start of California's energy crisis, the state depended on natural gas for more than one-third of its energy needs, the report said. Eighty-five percent of that gas came from out of state.   ""Because the state is so dependent on this one fuel source, the price spikes had a tremendous impact on our energy markets,"" the report says.   Increasing that dependence will only cause future price spikes, said Brad Heavner, a CalPIRG policy analyst and author of the report. About 95 percent of the plants that have been built or are under construction are fired by natural gas.   Natural gas ""is being treated as a magic bullet in this state and around the country,"" Heavner said.   Natural gas is cleaner than coal and less expensive than nuclear, and the state's new fleet of peaker plants -- small gas-fired power plants that come online when demand is highest -- can be built quickly.   But Heavner said California's demand for natural gas is rising faster than the federal Department of Energy forecast that calls for a 2.3 percent annual increase in the next 20 years.   ""This just means California is particularly vulnerable to any supply disruptions nationwide,"" Heavner said.   As demand is rising, natural gas production is waning, he said. There are 2 1/2 times the number of natural gas wells nationwide as there were in 1973, but each well produces a third as much gas, Heavner said.   To stabilize the state's energy supply, CalPIRG recommends that officials encourage a broader mix of fuels by requiring utilities to buy 20 percent of their power from renewable resources.   The new California Consumer Power and Conservation Financing Authority has set a goal of increasing the state's renewable energy output to 20 percent by 2006, said Amber Pasricha, spokeswoman for the authority.   The authority has signed 14 letters of intent for new renewable power plant projects, including 12 wind and two bio-fuel projects, she said.   CalPIRG also recommends that state energy regulators deny any pending applications for natural gas-fired plants and offer government subsidies to renewable power providers and customers.   The report also recommends the state review all contracts that the Department of Water Resources has signed with natural gas-fired power producers and explore canceling contracts that involve the construction of new gas-fired plants.             Alternative to state's SDG&E plan in works   Approval of the state plan to eliminate the $747 million debt SDG&E says it is owed by its customers could be headed for delay or derailment.   Consumer advocates and others say they will gather Monday in Sacramento to develop an alternative to the deal, which was announced by Gov. Gray Davis and the utility in June.   Consumer groups have criticized the governor's plan to eliminate the so-called balancing accounts as costly to consumers and a windfall to the utility.   The alternative proposal, which one consumer advocate says would save ratepayers more money, will be submitted to the California Public Utilities Commission for review. The commission had been set to complete its review of the governor's plan by the end of October.   Utilities Commissioner Carl Wood, who crafted the timetable for the review, acknowledged yesterday that his schedule did not anticipate the need to consider an alternative proposal. Wood said it was unclear how long that might take.   ""Much will depend on the perceived quality of the (alternative) plan,"" Wood said.   SDG&E, meanwhile, said it had not decided whether it will participate in the Monday meeting -- called a ""settlement conference"" under PUC rules -- and criticized the scheduling of the event.   ""We believe this is a delaying tactic designed to hijack this process,"" said Ed Van Herik, a spokesman for SDG&E, a unit of San Diego-based Sempra Energy. ""This is designed to undermine the authority of the utilities commission and the governor.""   Van Herik noted that components of the utility's plan have already been approved, while others remain on track. But a key issue -- whether customers or shareholders are entitled to hundreds of millions in profits SDG&E earned from selling power to the state -- has yet to be voted upon by the commission.   Steve Linsay, a supervisor for the Office of Ratepayer Advocates, a state office charged with representing consumers, noted that PUC regulations require a settlement conference in cases such as this.   ""By reaching a settlement with broad sponsorship, we hope the commission will give it the serious consideration it warrants,"" Linsay said.   Michael Shames, executive director of the Utility Consumers' Action Network, said an alternative proposal could eliminate the $747 million debt, lower customer rates and reduce ""windfalls"" for SDG&E at the same time.   Consumer groups have been particularly critical of revelations that SDG&E earned hundreds of millions in profits from the sale of electricity during the power crisis. They've also been critical of the profits they say Sempra will earn from future power sales.   The governor and SDG&E say their plan contains significant concessions by the utility and eliminates the balancing accounts without raising rates. Under their proposal, the company agrees to return about $200 million in profits from the sale of electricity and pay $100 million to close an investigation into its electricity procurement practices.   The utility says the balancing account arose when it paid more for electricity than it was able to collect from customers. The $747 million account amounted to a debt of $400 from each residential customer and higher sums from businesses.   But in computing the debt, SDG&E has declined to fully credit the profits it earned from power sales to the state. The utility says those gains are the exclusive property of its shareholders        Power Prices Splay Like Fingers on a $20 Hand  From top to bottom, there was not much difference between prices at Western hubs, with just about all peak transactions spread in a range from 20 mills/KWh to 27.5 mills/KWh midweek. Ranking prices at hubs from north to south nonetheless showed striations and marginal locational distinctions.   The Wednesday prices were a little bit higher in the pacific Northwest and slightly lower in California and the Desert Southwest than they were at the start of the week, as a burst of warmer weather added some load to utilities' systems. The California Independent System Operator has been revising its forecasts downward so far in the week, but that might change as temperatures rise. The peak so far was just shy of 35,000 MW on Tuesday.   Unit outages continued to swell, hitting as much as 7,500 MW in California on Tuesday. The balance between scheduled and unplanned maintenance varied each day. Major facilities that were all but out of service included El Segundo, Alamitos, Etiwanda and Encina-all reporting multiple units out for servicing. The new Sutter station was at half load and the Crockett cogeneration plant topped the short list of QF outages.   Mid-Columbia and California/Oregon Border prices had a hard time dragging out of weekend pricing floors of about 18.5 mills/KWh on Monday and Tuesday. By Wednesday's dealings, the northern prices splayed in this fashion: Mid-C, 20 mills to 20.5 mills/KWh for peak and 16.7 mills to 17 mills/KWh off peak; COB, 21.5 mills/KWh at peak and 18 mills/KWh off peak; NP15, 24.5 mills to 25 mills/KWh and 18 mills to 18.75 mills/KWh off peak. In the southern parts, SP15 was 25 mills to 25.5 mills/KWh in the daytime and 16.75 mills/KWh at night while Palo Verde rose to 26.5 mills to 27.5 mills/KWh for peak and 18 mills/KWh for off peak in sparse trading.   The Alberta Pool showed surprising volatility, with single-hour prices spiking to 223 mills/KWh on Tuesday as pool loads crossed 7,000 MW [Arthur O'Donnell]. <mailto:aod@newsdata.com>      Western Electricity Prices Mid-Week September 26, 2001  Hub  Peak (heavy)  Off-peak (light)  Alberta Pool (C$)  26.75-222  15-25.6  Mid-Columbia  18.5-20.5  16.7-17  COB  18.5-21.5  17-18  NP 15  22.5-25  18-18.5  SP 15  22.5-25.5  16.75-18  Palo Verde  24.75-27.5  16-18  Archives of the Western Price Survey for the past year are also available online. <http://www.newsdata.com/cem/prarchive.html>        PG&E'S TAX BILL WON'T GO DOWN; REORGANIZATION MAY BE GOOD NEWS TO SLO COASTAL  San Luis Obispo -- Pacific Gas and Electric Co.'s proposed bankruptcy reorganization should not cause a further erosion of property tax revenues in San Luis Obispo County, top company officials said Tuesday.   ""The tax base shouldn't change,'' said Gordon Smith, president and chief executive officer of PG&E. ""If anything, it should go up.''   That would be good news to both San Luis Obispo County and the San Luis Coastal Unified School District, which have taken budgetary hits in recent years as the company's Diablo Canyon nuclear power plant was devalued.   The power plant was devalued as part of the state's electrical deregulation. It has cost the county, schools and other agencies $10 million a year, said Gere Sibbach, county auditor-controller.   Property tax revenues from Diablo Canyon are divided with a third going to the county, a third to schools and a third to other governmental agencies. The county has been able to replace the lost utility taxes with other property taxes and has not been as hard hit as the school district, which has seen its annual budget go down $3 million, or 6 percent.   PG&E officials don't expect property taxes to decrease because the reorganization plan calls for Diablo Canyon and the company's hydroelectric plants to be valued at market rates, which are likely to be higher than its present valuation. The process is very similar to refinancing a home and should allow the utility to retire its $13 billion debt without selling off any assets, Smith said.   ""Basically, we have taken a second mortgage on our house to keep our house,"" he said.   Under the company's proposed bankruptcy plan, the company now known as PG&E will split up. The gas and electric distribution part of the company will retain the PG&E name while the corporation and the company's electrical generation arm -- which includes Diablo Canyon -- will be given a new name.   The plan must be approved by a bankruptcy judge and various regulators before it becomes final. If all goes as planned, the reorganization could take effect at the end of 2002.   Auditor-Controller Sibbach was more cautious in his assessment of the effects of the reorganization on county finances. County officials will be carefully tracking the reorganization plan as it wends its way through the approval process.   ""I hope he (Smith) is correct,"" Sibbach said. ""It could be significant.""",jeff.dasovich@enron.com,susan.mara@enron.com,FW: California Energy Issues -- Can you believe ANgelides' fear  mongering?,2001-09-27 13:23:28-07:00,sent

Please let me know if there are others I missed, or if there are changes needed to the ones listed.     1. Retroactive Suspension of DA Contracts:  The PUC rules in a subsequent decision that DA is suspended on some date  between July 1 and September 20th.    2. Contract renewal forbidden:  The PUC includes contract renewal under the suspension of DA.  3. No incremental ""DASR'ing"":  The PUC includes incremental additions and subtractions of DA customer's load under the  suspension of DA (e.g., fast food chains, University campus)  4. Cost allocation: the PUC adds new costs to DA accounts and/or disproportionately shifts existing costs to DA accounts.   Costs with greatest risk of being shifted to DA customers include: IOU undercollection, bonds to repay the state general fund,  and DWR contracts.  The costs associated with these categories are substantial.   Additional suggestions from Mike Day:  5. DASR processing: Related to #1 above, in that, if the utilities attempt to implement the Commission-ordered suspension  in an onerous way, it may put at risk contracts executed prior to 09.20.01 but not yet DASR'd.  6. Confidentiality of contract information: The utilities and/or the PUC may require ESPs to show contracts as proof   that contracts were executed prior to 09.20.01.  Key risks associated with each category: Adverse to P/L  Adverse to hedge (demand risk) ",susan.mara@enron.com,jeff.dasovich@enron.com,Regulatory Risks Tied to DA,2001-09-28 13:39:28-07:00,received
"fyi.  Extraordinary (Special) Session Rules and Procedures Call of Special Session:  Only the Governor has the authority to convene a special session of the Legislature. In convening the session, the Governor must issue a proclamation outlining the reasons for the special session, and only issues specified in the proclamation may be acted upon.  Election of Special Session Officers, Committees and Bill Referrals:  The election of officers and the appointment of special session committees are separate from the Legislature's regular session. In some instances, special session committees are comprised of different committee members than those appointed to regular session committees.  Identification of Special Session Bills and Publications:  Separate record-keeping publications (File, History, Journal and Roll Call) are printed for each individual extraordinary session. Special session bills are identified by specific paper colors (i.e. blue or green). For example, documents in the 2001 Second Extraordinary Session are printed on green paper.  Introduction of Special Session Bills:  There is no limit to the number of bills that a member of the Legislature may introduce during the extraordinary session, and none of the bills introduced during the extraordinary session count toward the member's bill limit in the Regular Session.  Special Session Bill Procedures and Calendars:  There is no bill introduction deadline during special sessions, and the ""30-day in print"" rule and committee file notice requirements do not apply. Special session bills also are not subject to the regular legislative session calendar, committee and/or floor deadlines. The sine die deadline requiring session to adjourn on November 30 of the second year of a legislative session does apply to the Special Session.  Effective Date of Special Session Legislation:  Simple majority vote special session bills take effect on the 91st day after the special session is adjourned. Urgency measures and other two-thirds majority-vote bills take effect immediately upon the Governor's signature. The Governor has 12 days from the date it is received on his desk to sign or veto legislation. Similar to the Regular Session, a special session bill may become law without the Governor's signature.  End of Special Session:  Only the Legislature, by concurrent resolution, may end a special session. The concurrent resolution takes effect upon passage by both houses of the Legislature, and is not subject to a Governor's signature or veto.

"On October 2, I, Aaron Klem and our outside attorney, Jeanne Bennett, met with other ESPs, the utilities, and the Energy Division staff of the CPUC to hammer out an agreement on implementing the CPUC's order suspending direct access (DA) and handling continued submission of DASRs.  It was news to the utilities that ESPs have many contracts --  most several years old -- that allow for addition and subtraction of facilities throughout the contract term.  The utilities had thought that cutting off DASRs would be the best way to enforce the CPUC's order without having to review contracts (which they don't want to do). After much discussion and debate, the participants agreed to make a joint filing at the CPUC seeking quick action.  Most agreed on the following plan (with the CPUC staff to check on the appropriate procedural vehicle): We will endeavor to reach agreement on a joint filing at the CPUC to modify Rule 22 (the rule that governs CPUC/ESP interactions) (a Petition to Modify was also discussed as a vehicle) - a small working group of attorneys has been set up to draft this.  The group includes Jeanne Bennett and Dian Grueneich, who represents UC/CSU. The new Rule 22 will add a section that acknowledges the CPUC action and sets forth therein (or in an Appendix) a verification procedure. Each ESP will submit a list of customers by this Friday, October 5, for ALL contracts -- existing and new -- to each utility. It will be diificult and perhaps impossible to add customers later, so be complete. Each ESP will submit to each utility the account level information for each customer on the list by November 1. All customer accounts should be on this list including facilities that have not yet been switched to DA, but may be switched sometime in the future.  Also, to the extent customers have plans for new facilities, put them on the list -- even if we do not yet have account information. Anyone who has the right to add DA later needs to be on the list. Any DASR submitted for an account on the November 1 list will be accepted by the utilities -- no matter when it is submitted. Additional accounts not on the November 1 list can be added through a verification process, such as an affidavit submitted by the ESP or by both the ESP and the customer.  This process is being worked out by the attorney working group. The CPUC will be asked to approve this approach quickly.    There is risk that the CPUC will NOT approve the approach and will cutoff DASRs on some date certain, in which case legal action would be required to allow for futher submission of DASRs. Steve Roskow of CPUC Energy Division said the CPUC has two factions -- one wants to cut off DA and the other wants it to continue.  He could not guarantee how the CPUC will respond to the joint approach.  He also mentioned that there are many lawyers at the CPUC looking at the retoactivity issue and the Commission's ability to affect existing contracts. Several participants, including Enron, UC/CSU and APSES, made strong statements about the legal problems the CPUC would face if they go down that road.  The utilities will be making a filing at the CPUC tomorrow that describes the steps they have taken to enforce the order.  PG&E and SDG&E will discuss the meeting and the joint plan -- PG&E may also say it will stick with some DASR cutoff date unless it hears otherwise from the CPUC.  SCE did not attend the meeting in person and at the end made clear that they had not agreed with the joint plan.  SCE is sticking with its original plan -- a customer and account list by September 24 and a DASR cutoff of October 20, no DASR accepted unless the name is on the customer list. The Energy Division staff is trying to move SCE off this position but I believe it comes from ""on high.""  We'll take our own run at it through a higher level at SCE. For now, we should continue to submit DASRs and follow the proposed joint plan and just keep records of our interactions with SCE (and the other utilities as well). If the situation does not improve in the next few days, we will reassess.  There is also the risk that the CPUC will not act on the joint approach quickly, leaving these issues in limbo and the utilities assuming ""risk"" that they have done the wrong thing and will be ""punished."" Not surprisingly, the utilities seem to favor a drop dead date for DASR submission, as a way to minimize this risk.  During the course of the meeting, the utilities mentioned a ""compromise"" of January 1, 2002 for a DASR cutff date.  They thought this would give the CPUC time to act on the joint plan, but allow them to minimize their risk in the event the CPUC decides that the utilities should have cutoff DASRs from the beginning.  This notion may appear in the filings to be made tomorrow.  I told them that any drop-dead date for DASR submission would be unacceptable to Enron. UC/CSU said the same.  A few ESPs seemed ready to accept the 1/1/02 cutoff but most do not.  Call with any questions.

In the article, Treasurer Angelides criticizes the PUC for delaying the decision on direct access, while Loretta Lynch defends the action and notes that Angelides' requested the delay.  Davis hopes to rework power deals: The long-term energy pacts are having a big impact on the state's budget. By Jim Sanders Bee Capitol Bureau (Published Oct. 20, 2001)  With California holding billions in long-term energy contracts at higher-than-market prices, Gov. Gray Davis' advisers said Friday that he will try to renegotiate some of the pacts.  But some large businesses aren't waiting -- they're cutting their own deals with electricity suppliers and leaving homeowners and small businesses holding the bag, state records show.  ""This stampede could shift over $8 billion in costs to these consumers in coming years,"" said state Treasurer Phil Angelides.  The developments reflect a new dilemma: The state's strategy of negotiating long-term contracts helped end the electricity crisis but sparked a new set of financial problems that could affect the state for the next decade.  What began in January as the temporary purchase of emergency power for debt-ridden Pacific Gas and Electric Co., Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas & Electric Co. has shaken the state's budget and clouded future spending.  The signing of long-term contracts was vital and effective at a time when electricity costs were spiraling out of control, but falling prices have prompted a re-examination of some of them, Davis' advisers said Friday.  The focus on long-term contracts overshadowed the disclosure that the state expects its total electricity costs for the three utilities to be $17.2 billion by December 2002 -- less than the $21.4 billion originally estimated and further evidence that the crisis has abated.  Barry Goode, Davis' legal affairs secretary, declined to discuss how many of the long-term contracts the governor wants to renegotiate.  ""Certainly we're not targeting every contract,"" he said. ""Long-term contracts have been extremely valuable in keeping the market stable. ... I don't think you should expect some kind of wholesale effort on all these contracts.""  Davis has signed more than 50 long-term contracts, with about two dozen generators, for roughly $43 billion in electricity. Power purchased under the pacts will average $69 per megawatt-hour over the next 10 years -- more than double the current market rate.  Goode and other Davis spokesmen declined to comment Friday on which companies will be asked to resume negotiations, whether they already have been approached, and what arguments will be used.  ""I'd rather not show my cards at this point,"" Goode said.  Steve Stengel, a spokesman for Dynegy Inc., was noncommittal.  ""We have a legally binding agreement with the state, so therefore we don't feel an obligation to renegotiate, he said. ""But we would be willing to consider renegotiation if it was mutually beneficial.""  Gary Ackerman of the Western Power Trading Forum, an association of generators and traders, said the state would have to ""give up something in exchange"" for any reworking of the deals.  Possibilities include dropping lawsuits against generators or settling disputes over previous electricity purchases, he said.  Whether Davis ultimately is successful in reducing the burden, the state's plan is to issue $12.5 billion in bonds to repay itself for current and future purchases. That plan relies on repayment from utility customers, including businesses.  But in the past three months, some big electricity users have removed themselves as ratepayers in the three investor-owned utility districts and cut their own deals with generators for electricity, state records show.  With every departure, utilities have fewer customers to repay the $12.5 billion bonds, increasing the financial burden on homeowners and small businesses.  ""It isn't fair and it isn't right,"" Angelides said.  He blamed the state Public Utilities Commission for not preventing such departures sooner. Originally scheduled to act in June, the PUC delayed a vote until September.  Angelides wrote PUC President Loretta Lynch on Friday asking that the agency's decision be made retroactive to July 1.  Lynch labeled the request ""amazing"" and said the PUC delayed its decision in June at the behest of Angelides and other state officials.  She declined to comment on whether she would support a modification, saying she wants to hear arguments from all sides.  Lynch said the problem of shifting bond costs onto consumers could be eased by renegotiating the state's long-term contracts.

What I said in total, when asked to response from AReM's perspective on Angelides' comments that DA would shift $8B over time to other ratepayers was:  ""Direct access is still a small part of California's energy market. However, direct access is being held up as the scapegoat when one of the biggest problems we have right now is $43 billion in contracts that effectively hold California ratepayers hostage to the utilities for decades, if not renegotiated.""    Small users might face $8 billion power bill Direct-access loophole used by big customers   By Craig D. Rose  STAFF WRITER   October 20, 2001   A legal loophole exploited by large electricity customers could leave mostly smaller customers shouldering $8 billion more in electricity costs than they should, the state treasurer disclosed yesterday.  The loophole opened over the summer when it became clear that large customers could get lower electricity prices and might avoid the billions in state costs from the electricity crisis by entering into so-called direct-access relationships with alternative electricity suppliers.  Under direct-access deals, customers bypass their local utility as a source of electricity and turn instead to an outside provider. The California Public Utilities Commission barred direct access in late September. In a letter yesterday, State Treasurer Philip Angelides chided the utilities commission for failing to close the loophole sooner and urged commissioners to retroactively cancel direct-access deals dating to July 1.  Angelides said the ""direct-access stampede, which occurred as the PUC failed to act,"" could cost utility customers $800 million through 2002, and more than $8.2 billion while the state is financing power costs.  Commission President Loretta Lynch said the PUC delayed dealing with direct access on the advice of the governor, Angelides and the Legislature. She added that the commission is considering retroactive cancellation of direct-access deals.  Other state officials, meanwhile, offered few clues yesterday as to how they plan to seek changes to some of the long-term contracts that cover $43 billion in state power purchases. Gov. Gray Davis indicated Thursday that he might seek to renegotiate some contract terms.  In a teleconference yesterday, advisers to the governor said discussing their strategy might compromise their bargaining position. Barry Goode, Davis' legal secretary, said the state is not pursuing changes for all the long-term contracts -- there are more than 50 -- and he defended the contracts as ""very valuable and an asset to the state.""  A growing number of critics says the contracts bind the state to expensive and in some case unnecessary electricity purchases. Industrial and large commercial customers, meanwhile, scrambled over the summer to avoid those state costs by signing direct-access deals.  From July until Sept. 20, when the PUC barred the deals, large customers boosted the amount of power they bought via direct access from 2 percent to 13 percent.  In San Diego Gas & Electric territory, the flight was heavier. About 18 percent of electricity now purchased by large power users is done via direct access, bypassing the utility.  At the same time, direct access has been largely unavailable to smaller customers. In fact, providers dumped residential direct-access customers as uneconomical during the power crisis.  Smaller customers of SDG&E, Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas and Electric Co., meanwhile, must now bear the costs of California's long-term power contracts and of costs incurred earlier this year to deal with the crisis.  The impact of direct access was underscored in an additional way by state officials yesterday. Advisers to the governor explained that estimates of state power purchase obligations for 2001 and 2002 have fallen by about 20 percent, from $21.4 billion down to $17.2 billion.  But the retail cost of state-purchased electricity will fall only 5.5 percent for the overwhelming majority of utility customers statewide. That's because fewer customers remain to pay the costs, according to the state Department of Water Resources, which is responsible for California's power purchases.  The Alliance for Retail Energy Markets, an electricity supplier group, reiterated yesterday that it will sue the utilities commission if it moves to retroactively cancel direct access. Tracy Fairchild, a spokeswoman for the group, said direct access was not the cause of high power prices for the state.  ""One of the biggest problems we have right now is $43 billion in contracts that effectively hold California ratepayers hostage to the utilities for decades, if not renegotiated,"" Fairchild said.  In a separate matter, the utilities commission said yesterday it will not schedule additional hearings to deal with a second plan for resolving the $747 million debt that SDG&E says it is owed by its customers.  Commission President Loretta Lynch indicated last week that hearings might be held in San Diego. Lynch said yesterday she erred in suggesting the hearings without first consulting with Commissioner Carl Wood, who is assigned to oversee the SDG&E proceedings.  Consumer and environmental groups filed the second plan as an alternative to a proposal presented by SDG&E and the governor for dealing with the debt. Consumer groups say their plan would require at least $185 million more from the utility to pay down the debt and would thereby save consumers at least that much money.  State officials also said yesterday that the governor and state Legislature remain at loggerheads over a bill by Senate President Pro Tempore John Burton, D-San Francisco, that would separate a $12.5 billion bond offering from the power contracts. The bill was approved by the Legislature in special session.  Davis' press secretary, Steve Maviglio, said again yesterday that the governor will veto the bill, which has not yet been sent to him. The Davis administration says the bill would trigger lawsuits from electricity suppliers who hold contracts with the state.

"Legal status of SBX2 18  -----Original Message----- From: Aaron Thomas [mailto:aaron.thomas@aesmail.com] Sent: Friday, October 19, 2001 6:18 PM To: 'Norman Plotkin'; arem@electric.com Subject: RE: SBX2 18   Or, he is working on the override votes?  -----Original Message----- From: Norman Plotkin [mailto:nplotkin@rcsis.com] Sent: Friday, October 19, 2001 6:17 PM To: arem@electric.com Subject: SBX2 18   Greetings: On the subject of SBX2 18, this is where it stands:  I.  Article IV Section 10(b)(3) of the Cal. Const. states that any bill presented to the Governor that is not returned within 12 days becomes a statute.   So, the Governor has 12 days to sign or veto a bill; unless ...  II.  Section 10(b)(1) says that any non-reapportionment bill passed by the Legislature on or before the date of adjournment for interim recess that arrives to the Gov. after the adjournment, that is not returned within 30 days becomes a statute.  So bills passed in the last week, that because of the enrollment process do not find their way to the Gov. until after adjournment have 30 days.  III.  Section 10(b)(1) does not apply to Extraordinary Session bills- they always have 12 days to be signed or vetoed.  However, the clock does not begin ticking until the Gov. receives the bill.  This last point is the kicker.  Burton is still holding the bill in Enrollment.  So it can remain there until:  1. Burton frees it from Enrollment and sends it to the Gov. at which time it has 12 days to be signed or vetoed;  2. The Legislature returns either sometime this fall or in Jan. and forces the bill by motion to the Gov. (not likely);  3. The Legislature returns and adjourns the Snd Ex Session.  For all intents and purposes the bill is dead ... the Gov has indicated it would be vetoed and so Burton has held it.  Burton is either holding it to save it from a certain veto, or waiting to send it until a possible shifting in the political sands.","jeff.dasovich@enron.com, d..steffes@enron.com, paul.kaufman@enron.com",susan.mara@enron.com,FW: SBX2 18,2001-10-22 10:15:53-07:00,sent

Lynch Urging July 1 DA Suspension Date  I'm sure that by now everyone's seen the letter that Angelides sent to Loretta last Friday.  If you haven't, let me know and I'll have it faxed to you.  In short, Angelides blames all of the financial woes of the State on Loretta and the PUC.  Specifically, he claims that by allowing DA sign-ups to extend to September 20th, the PUC may have shifted over $8 billion to ""homeowners, small businesses, and other enterprises...""  Angelides ends the lettery by urging the Commission to immediately roll back the DA suspension date to July 1.  The concern, of course, is that Angelides' assertions are out there and have received alot of press attention, i.e., Direct Access=$8 billion tax on homeowners.    To her credit, Loretta refuted Angelides in the press accounts and repeated that the best way to get costs down is to renegotiate the DWR contracts.  She also said in the press accounts that she intends to deal with the July 1/September 20 suspension issue at the next commission meeting.  In light of these events (and the increasing attacks on Loretta by Angelides and others in the Administration) It might be useful to give Loretta an assist by drafting a very brief letter to her stating:  Angelides is all wet--DA and ""fairness"" are not mutually exclusive and the PUC has all the regulatory tools necessary to ensure fairness is maintained going forward.  Thus, the 8 plus billion dollar number is without basis. Re-stating that the PUC has no legal authority to retroactively suspend DA to July 1, etc., etc.  Folks may have other points to make.  Seems that we'd want to keep the letter short and to the point, however.    A letter might be useful in order to 1) give Loretta some support and 2) get some counter-press in response to the Angelides tantrum.  Any thoughts?

"Changes to the Distribution Revenue Requirement  -----Original Message----- From: JBennett [mailto:JBennett@GMSSR.com] Sent: Monday, October 22, 2001 8:33 AM To: Jeff Dasovich (E-mail); Sue Mara (E-mail) Cc: 'mpetroch@enron.com'; 'acomnes@enron.com' Subject: Rehearing on PG&E's GRC   Almost two years after issuing a decision in PG&E's GRC, the Commission issued it rehearing order on October 16th and, lo and behold, actually granted TURN's rehearing request in part.  The overall result is to reduce the capital revenue requirement by $24.8 million and expenses by $37.3 million.  In addition, some portion of PG&E' estimated $171 million in electric distribution capital spending will be subject to rehearing. Listed  below are the areas in which the Commission granted rehearing.  1.  Electric Distribution Capital Spending.    The Commission will, in essence, reopen the record, and allow PG&E to put into evidence how much it invested in its electric distribution plant in 1998.  PG&E had used a 1998 forecasted amt of capital expenditures to develop its test year forecast. TURN argued that there was substantial evidence on the record that this amount was never spent. PG&E argued that the record closed prior to the end of 1998 so the best it could do was an estimate.  On rehearing, the Commission agreed with TURN, that there was evidence that the forecasted amount was never spent, so they are allowing PG&E to prove it.  The rehearing order states that any rates that are raised based on the electric distribution capital forecast adopted the GRC decision  may be subject to refund.  2.  Emergency Response Work This work category under electric distribution capital spending was reduced by $17.2 million.  3.  Vegetation Management. The Supplemental Tree Trimming Program was reduced by $9.2 million.  4.  Meter Reading.  PG&E had primarily used accounting changes to justify the large increase in this service.  On rehearing the Commission stated that PG&E had failed to substantiate those changes and reduced the allowed amount by $7.9 million.  5. Account Services.  On rehearing the commission stated that PG&E had failed to show (a) why it cost so much more to provide services to CIA customers  than residential customers ( $43.30 vs. $10.20); and (b) that money was not going for marketing activities that the Commission had disallowed in the previous GRC.  The result was that the commission disallowed $20 million.  6.  Customer Information Systems.  The Commission disallowed $7.2 million as funds which ratepayers had already expended for CIS  rewrites for which they had not received any benefits.

On October 21, 2001, CDWR held a public workshop in Sacramento = to provide an overview of the draft updated revenue requirement and answer = questions from the public. In addition, on October 23, 2001, CDWR and its c= onsultants held a telephone conference call to discuss the model supporting=  the updated draft revenue requirement with those parties that have execute= d a nondisclosure agreement with CDWR and Navigant Consulting, Inc. (""NDA"")= . CDWR is accepting written comments on its October 19, 2001 draft updated = revenue requirement on or before October 26, 2001 and intends to submit an = updated revenue requirement to the California Public Utilities Commission (= ""CPUC"") on or about November 2, 2001. Written comments may be submitted ele= ctronically to CDWR to the attention of the following persons:  Ron Nichols (Navigant Consulting, Inc) at rnichols@navigantconsulting.com <= mailto:rnichols@navigantconsulting.com>  Peter Garris (Acting Deputy Director, CDWR) at cperciva@water.ca.gov <mailt= o:cperciva@water.ca.gov>  In the context of the ongoing revenue requirement allocation proceeding at = the CPUC, parties to A.00-11-038 et al. have previously submitted written d= ata requests to CDWR in response to CDWR's August 7th revenue requirement s= ubmission to the CPUC.  Responses to these data requests would not have bee= n helpful to the parties because CDWR was preparing an updated revenue requ= irement.  CDWR believed it would be more productive for all parties for CDW= R to address questions concerning the updated revenue requirement rather th= an respond to questions pertaining to the prior filing.  Further, CDWR has = not intervened as an active party in the CPUC proceeding and is not under a= n obligation to respond to parties' data requests. Notwithstanding this fac= t and in order to facilitate the prompt resolution of the CPUC revenue requ= irement allocation proceeding, CDWR intends to provide written responses to=  parties' data requests on or before November 1, 2001. CDWR will provide it= s responses to data requests to the entire service list for A.00-11-038, wi= th the exception that NCI Confidential Information will only be disclosed t= o those parties that have executed an NDA. CDWR does not intend to provide = responses to data requests relating to the August 7th revenue requirement a= s that submission will be superceded by an updated revenue requirement. CDW= R requests that parties to A.00-11-038 submit any further written data requ= ests concerning the October 19th draft updated revenue requirement by close=  of business today.  Resource constraints will prevent CDWR from responding=  to further data requests, which are not received by CDWR by close of busin= ess today.  Please telephone me with any questions.

"The Meet & Confer will be meetings and teleconfs held simultaneously at the three utilities' offices. The plan is that I am going over to the meeting at PG&E along with Jeanne Bennett and Dian Grueneich (who represents UC/CSU). AReM's attorney will be at the SCE meeting.

"I don't agree Edison's premise -- that ""direct access customers contributed=  just as much to SCE's procurement costs undercollection as bundled service=  customers."" We need to make clear that we don't buy in to their rhetoric.  Here's my reasoning.  DA Customers are completely different from bundled customers. SCE had to bu= y power to serve the bundled load.  SCE did not buy power for DA customers.=   SCE's purchases of the power to serve the bundled load coupled with high = wholesale prices and an inability to raise rates was the direct reason for = the undercollection. I can make the argument that the undercollection is SO= LELY related to BUNDLED SERVICE.  There are two big reasons that back me up: AB 1890 and Top-down rates.  I w= ill explain.  The utilities got what they wanted out of AB 1890 -- payments=  of $30 plus billion in so-called stranded costs and a real delay in any co= mpetitive retail market until their costs were paid off.  One of the tradeo= ffs, however, was that the utilities were at risk FOR HIGH PRICES in the WH= OLESALE MARKET.  Everyone understood that if there were high gas prices or = bad hydro years, the utilities would be squeezed and not collect their bill= ions by the 3/31/01 deadline. That's the risk they agreed to.  Now, they ar= e claiming that they were ENTITLED to that money and more.  This is in dire= ct conflict with the statute. I can make the argument that the statute requ= ires SCE to assume this risk and therefore any undercollection is theirs al= one -- now the CPUC can bail them out -- but that doesn't make ESPs subject=  to any presumed ""undercollection.""  Now to the rates.  At the beginning of DA, the utilities did not want to do=  a real rate case and separate the costs of the wholesale business and the = retail busness from T&D. So, they did a ""top-down"" calculation.  This meant=  that there had to be a ""credit"" put on the bills of DA customers to accoun= t for the costs the utility avoided by having the customers switch to DA. S= o, the PX Credit structure was a direct result of the utilities unwillingne= ss to unbundle specific components of the rates.  Next, although bundled cu= stomers rates were capped, the decisions from the CPUC made it clear that t= here was no similar cap for DA customers -- their rates and bills would be = whatever was charged by their ESPs.  However, when the utilities filed thei= r tariffs with the CPUC, they added a cap for the PX credit that was neithe= r proposed nor authorized by the Commission.  Enron attacked it, but got no= where, until WPTF and Enron brought it up in the 1998 RAP Proceeding. Our a= rgument was that the bundled rates were capped but not the bills of DA cust= omers -- and the credit was supposed to represent the full costs the utilit= ies avoided by not serving DA customers.  We argued that anything less is f= undamentally unfair and anticomeptitive.  The utilities must have thought w= e had a good case, because they agreed to settle. The settlement was accept= ed by the Commission in the proceeding. Everyone understood that eliminatin= g the cap on the PX Credit was primarily to allow the PX Credit to FLOAT AB= OVE THE CAP when wholesale prices were high. So, we have a legal right to r= eceive the full PX Credit/Negative CTC which is separate and distinct from = any undercollection associated with bundled customers.

Haven't heard back from Bob, but we may be able to avoid the call.  Mike Day got in touch with Edison's attorney this morning and here's the end result.  Edison has agreed to tell the judge on the 7th that, with respect to the complaints we've filed, they agree to take them off calendar until and unless parties ask to put them back on calendar. Edison will  take the view that the proceedings underway at the commission (and presumably attempts to ""settle"" with parties) will resolve the issues in the complaint. The assumption from out end is that the status quo remains intact.  That is, we will continue to pay the Commission, not Edison, for T&D charges during the ""time out"" on our complaints.   Mike and Jeanne will make sure that this critical piece, i.e., that we continue to place payments in escrow, will remain intact as part of the ""time out.""

"I've been talking to other ESPs about the PX Credit Payment and the Barnett proceeding.  Some tidbits:  New West -- wants to keep the payment issues out of the proceeding and wil attempt to do that.  They don't have a complaint filed, so they need SCE to have good faith bilateral settlement discussions.  Good luck there.  Their meeting with SCE is 11/6.  New Energy -- New Energy returned all customers (but one) before May 2000. The one customer -- Krogers (grocery store chain) -- has been very active at the Legislature on this and will attend the SCE meeting. No meeting has been set up but one is expected next week. Has been more willing to talk about ""cost shifting"" but thinks SCE's proposal is ludicrous. I suggested it would be a bad idea to go down SCE's cost shifting road right now. Is outraged by SCE's proposal.  APSES --  Is outraged by SCE's proposal. Told SCE he wouldn't meet until SCE gives him the proposed payment amount and substantiation for it. He believes that SCE has no way to determne an accurate number.  He will also insist that SCE true-up the amount, once the ISO hits the utilities with the underscheduling penalty.  And finally, he will insist that SCE complete the PX Credit audit before he'll agree to a number.  APSES is the other party with a complaint filed at the Commission.

The decision is pretty clear on this.  As you recall, the issue was raised by UC/CSU who specifically mentioned that the utilities were unilaterally setting deadlines for submission of customer names and DASRs. Let me quote:  Section F, p. 19:  ""In its rehearing application, UC/CSU seek clarification on whether D.01-09-060's prohibition of any new contracts for direct access services after September 20, 2001, allows or requires utilities to refuse to process DASRs for an account under a pre-September 20 contract.""  p.20:  ""We reaffirm that for the time being, and unless the Commission states otherwise in a subsequent decision, utilities are required to process DASRs relating to contracts or agreements that were executed on or before September 20, 2001, including DASRs for service to new facilities or accounts if the underlying contract pursuant to which those DASRs are submitted allowed for the provision of that additional service.""  p.21  ""For purpose of utility compliance with D.01-09-060, we want to make it clear that, unless otherwise directed or allowed to in a subsequent Commission decision, utilities cannot set a deadline after which they could refuse to process DASRs relating to contracts excuted on or before September 20, 2001.""  Matt, these are just the highlights.  The Decision has more language providing additional clarity.  By the way, this decision was mailed on October 12 -- after your October 5 deadline. I think the Decision is crystal clear.  You must accept all DASRs for contracts signed on or before September 20 and you cannot set artificial deadlines after which you will not accept those DASRs.  So, given the above.  Can you please explain your position?  Regarding the Novemver 1 date -- you may remember the Rule 22 meeting held by the utilities, ESPs and customers in eaarly October.  The ESPs agreed to make a good faith effort to provide a complete customer list by November 1, with the understanding that additional names and facilities could be added later with some verification process to ensure the DA contract was signed on or before September 20.  We agreed to do this to help the utilities meet their obligations under D. 01-09-060.  Enron has met that commitment.

The decision is pretty clear on this. As you recall, the issue was raised by UC/CSU who specifically mentioned that the utilities were unilaterally setting deadlines for submission of customer names and DASRs. Let me quote:  Section F, p. 19:  ""In its rehearing application, UC/CSU seek clarification on whether D.01-09-060's prohibition of any new contracts for direct access services after September 20, 2001, allows or requires utilities to refuse to process DASRs for an account under a pre-September 20 contract.""  p.20:  ""We reaffirm that for the time being, and unless the Commission states otherwise in a subsequent decision, utilities are required to process DASRs relating to contracts or agreements that were executed on or before September 20, 2001, including DASRs for service to new facilities or accounts if the underlying contract pursuant to which those DASRs are submitted allowed for the provision of that additional service.""  p.21  ""For purpose of utility compliance with D.01-09-060, we want to make it clear that, unless otherwise directed or allowed to in a subsequent Commission decision, utilities cannot set a deadline after which they could refuse to process DASRs relating to contracts excuted on or before September 20, 2001.""  Matt, these are just the highlights.  The Decision has more language providing additional clarity.  By the way, this decision was mailed on October 12 -- after your October 5 deadline. I think the Decision is crystal clear.  You must accept all DASRs for contracts signed on or before September 20 and you cannot set artificial deadlines after which you will not accept those DASRs.  So, given the above.  Can you please explain your position?  Regarding the Novemver 1 date -- you may remember the Rule 22 meeting held by the utilities, ESPs and customers in eaarly October.  The ESPs agreed to make a good faith effort to provide a complete customer list by November 1, with the understanding that additional names and facilities could be added later with some verification process to ensure the DA contract was signed on or before September 20.

"OK Matt,  You're answer ignores the very direct order by the CPUC that specifically prohibits you from setting this type of deadline.  What am I missing?  Please explain your rationale for violating a specific order of the CPUC.  By the way, it was interesting to learn that you now want to discuss this at the PHC.  At our meeting Monday (10/29), the utilities (including Edison) were quite firm that they did not want to address these issues in the PHC, but wanted to complete the Advice Letter process.

The decision is pretty clear on this.

Let me quote:  Section F, p. 19:  ""In its rehearing application, UC/CSU seek clarification on whether D.01-09-060's prohibition of any new contracts for direct access services after September 20, 2001, allows or requires utilities to refuse to process DASRs for an account under a pre-September 20 contract.""  p.20:  ""We reaffirm that for the time being, and unless the Commission states otherwise in a subsequent decision, utilities are required to process DASRs relating to contracts or agreements that were executed on or before September 20, 2001, including DASRs for service to new facilities or accounts if the underlying contract pursuant to which those DASRs are submitted allowed for the provision of that additional service.""  p.21  ""For purpose of utility compliance with D.01-09-060, we want to make it clear that, unless otherwise directed or allowed to in a subsequent Commission decision, utilities cannot set a deadline after which they could refuse to process DASRs relating to contracts excuted on or before September 20, 2001.""  Matt, these are just the highlights.  The Decision has more language providing additional clarity.  By the way, this decision was mailed on October 12 -- after your October 5 deadline. I think the Decision is crystal clear.  You must accept all DASRs for contracts signed on or before September 20 and you cannot set artificial deadlines after which you will not accept those DASRs.  So, given the above.  Can you please explain your position?  Regarding the Novemver 1 date -- you may remember the Rule 22 meeting held by the utilities, ESPs and customers in eaarly October.  The ESPs agreed to make a good faith effort to provide a complete customer list by November 1, with the understanding that additional names and facilities could be added later with some verification process to ensure the DA contract was signed on or before September 20.  We agreed to do this to help the utilities meet their obligations under D. 01-09-060. Enron has met that commitment.

Further, SCE's approach is in violation of the CPUC's decision on rehearing (D 01-10-036), which requires SCE to continue to accept DASRs as long as the respective contract is signed on or before 9-20-01.  Therefore, Enron reserves the right to continue DASRing accounts for eligible contracts until the CPUC directs otherwise.  Thanks.

Original SCE Communication Sent on September 21, 2001  Pursuant to the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) decision issued yesterday, the right of end-use customers to acquire direct access service is suspended as September 20, 2001.  Specifically, the CPUC order states:       ""The execution of any new contracts, or entering into, or verification of any new arrangements for direct access              service pursuant to Public Utilities Code Sections 366 or 366.5, after September 20, 2001, is prohibited"" (Ordering              Paragraph No. 4).               and,              ""PG&E, SCE and SDG&E shall not accept any direct access service requests [DASRs] for any contracts executed              or agreements entered into after September 20, 2001."" (Ordering Paragraph No. 7).  In order to comply with the CPUC order please provide Southern California Edison with a certified list of your direct access customers that have written contracts or agreements executed on or before September 20, 2001, for which DASRs have not yet been submitted.  This list may be subject to verification in the future, therefore, please be prepared to produce evidence of these contracts or agreements upon request. The following information must be included for each customer on this list for your DASR to be eligible for future processing:  Please include the following information for each customer on this list:       ?    Customer Name      ?    Service Account Number      ?    Service Address      ?    Contract Date  This list should be sent via e-mail to Sheila Advani at Sheila.Advani@sce.com, no later than      5:00 p.m. Pacific Daylight Savings Time, Monday, September 24, 2001  For those direct access customers that have certified contracts or verified agreements executed on or before September 20, 2001, ESPs must submit the respective ""connect"" Direct Access Service Requests (DASRs) within 30 calendar days following the effective date of the order.  All ""connect"" DASRs submitted for accounts, which are not on the ESP's certified list, will be rejected or canceled.  SCE will not process any ""connect"" DASRs after 5:00 p.m., October 20, 2001.  SCE will continue to accept ""disconnect"" and ""update"" DASRs (for changes to billing and/or metering options) for existing Direct Access customers.

Further, SCE's approach is in violation of the CPUC's decision on  rehearing  (D 01-10-036), which requires SCE to continue to accept DASRs as long as  the respective contract is signed on or before 9-20-01.   Therefore, Enron reserves the right to continue DASRing accounts for  eligible contracts until the CPUC directs otherwise.   Thanks.

Original SCE Communication Sent on September 21, 2001   Pursuant to the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) decision  issued yesterday, the right of end-use customers to acquire direct  access  service is suspended as September 20, 2001.  Specifically, the CPUC  order  states:        ""The execution of any new contracts, or entering into, or  verification  of any new arrangements for direct access               service pursuant to Public Utilities Code Sections 366 or  366.5, after September 20, 2001, is prohibited"" (Ordering               Paragraph No. 4).                and,               ""PG&E, SCE and SDG&E shall not accept any direct access  service  requests [DASRs] for any contracts executed               or agreements entered into after September 20, 2001.""  (Ordering Paragraph No. 7).   In order to comply with the CPUC order please provide Southern  California  Edison with a certified list of your direct access customers that have  written contracts or agreements executed on or before September 20,  2001,  for which DASRs have not yet been submitted.  This list may be subject  to  verification in the future, therefore, please be prepared to produce  evidence of these contracts or agreements upon request. The following  information must be included for each customer on this list for your  DASR  to be eligible for future processing:   Please include the following information for each customer on this list:        ?    Customer Name       ?    Service Account Number       ?    Service Address       ?

All ""connect""  DASRs submitted for accounts, which are not on the ESP's certified list,  will be rejected or canceled.  SCE will not process any ""connect"" DASRs  after 5:00 p.m., October 20, 2001.

I am comfortable taking the lead from Enron on this issue and would support not advocating it be included in this case.  I think SCE is going to push for its inclusion, so Sue will need to provide you with some amunition on why it doesn't belong in this case before Wednesday.   On the second question, no.  I don't think we want to re-raise the rev req and tres letter leading to the end of DA.   I not sure we should push the bottoms up issue in this case.  It is not at all clear what the ALJ is trying to pull into the case with the reference to post px credits.  There is no pending matters on this, but for advice letters and protests.  We are much better fighting in that forum given the current decisions rather than getting some nasty decision from Barnett that messes up the victory we got in the rate increase decisions.   I strongly urge that we NOT push this into this proceeding.  It will be all downside.  Changes to the PE Credit (i.e. reductions) may end up here, but we should not be calling for it.   Lastly, how can we say that the commission doesn't have authority to implement exit fees without changes in law given prior filings of ARM that said they should implement a whole host of exit fees rather than end DA.  I don't think we can take this position without explaining the flip flop, which we certainly don't have room to do in the PHC statement.  Maybe we can get away with referencing other parties strong position on this and support the requirement of hearings if any such attempt is going to be made to establish exit fees.

"PG&E also mentioned it.  Here is the excerpt from its commnets on the Wood ACR filed 11/2/01.  1. What effect, if any, should be given to renewals of contracts originally entered into prior to the effective date of the Commission's suspension of direct access?  An appropriate charge on direct access customers obviates the need to regulate renewals of direct access contracts entered into on or before September 20, 2001.  Absent the charge, the Commission would need to address what kind of renewals should be covered by any potential prohibition against renewals.  Prohibited renewals could include (1) renewal of contracts whose terms expire without any provisions for extension; and (2) renegotiation within the contract term of any material term or condition of the contract, including price.  The Commission would also need to consider whether an interim prohibition on renewals is needed to stop renegotiations or renewals that are very likely underway already, pending final Commission action.       -----Original Message----- From:  Smith, Mike   Sent: Wednesday, November 07, 2001 10:10 AM To: Mara, Susan Cc: Dasovich, Jeff; Steffes, James D.; Frazier, Lamar; Blachman, Jeremy Subject: RE: CA Extenstions/Amendments  thanks.  this is really important to the restructures we are working on.

"Gang:  Further clarification on what happened at the pre-hearing conference today:  The Judge set he would rule on only two issues at this time (most likely the ruling will be out within a week):  1.  PX Audit -- The Commission will decide the issue on the current record (this is fine with us) 2. Implementation of Suspension of DA. -- This includes all the DASR issues, ability to make amendments as well as ESP assignments and the like.  The Judge decided he could rule after paper hearings.  The following schedule was agreed to:  11/16 -- Utilities file their proposal with the intent for it to be uniform for all three utilities 11/28 -- Parties file comments on utilities' proposal; may request hearings on specific issues and justify why needed (although the Judge already said he did not believe that hearings were necessary) 12/4 -- Parties file responses on the comments  All other issues will be addressed at another Pre-hearing conference on 12/12.   In response to a question, the Judge said he would not issue a ruling on the retroactive suspension of direct access at this time, but did not believe that hearings were required on the issue.  He also said several times, however, that hearings would be required on all issues that involved dollars and cents. (To most logical people, this would seem to conflict with the notion that no hearings were required on the retroactivity issue  --  but, hey, this is California.)  Bottomline:  This turned out better than we had expected.  We wanted hearings on the money issues and any delay in addressing the retroactivity issue is good for our side.      -----Original Message----- From:  Dasovich, Jeff   Sent: Wednesday, November 07, 2001 5:23 PM To: Blachman, Jeremy; Mara, Susan; Steffes, James D.; Shapiro, Richard; Kean, Steven J.; Kaufman, Paul; Leff, Dan; Hughes, Evan; Sharp, Vicki; Williams, Robert C.; Dietrich, Janet; Huddleson, Diann; Smith, Mike; Frazier, Lamar; Tribolet, Michael; Mellencamp, Lisa; Curry, Wanda; Swain, Steve Subject: Update on California PUC Hearing--DA Suspension Implementation; Exit Fees; PX Credit, etc.--11.07.01  Please forward along to others I may have missed but need to know:  The Commission held a hearing this afternoon to discuss the need for hearings on issues surrounding the DA suspension. With minor exceptions, the utilities told the Commission that the Commission didn't need to conduct hearings, and that the Commission could just go forward with implementing the suspension and assess exit fees.   The utilities said that hearings could be held ""sometime later"" to determine the exact level of exit fees and how the utilities ought to calcualte the PX credit going forward. A large group of business customers and suppliers disagreed strongly and made a very good case for hearings. There were lengthy arguments in front of the judge, at the end of which the judge decided that it would useful to hold another prehearing conference. The next hearing will be on Dec. 12th. The judge wanted another hearing to permit folks to have the opportunity to respond to the first round of comments on the issues submitted by everyone last Friday. In sum, there will be another hearing on Dec. 12th to further discuss the need for hearings prior to the Commission making decisions on these issues. At this point, it appears that the judge is leaning toward having comprehensive hearings. Of particular note, at the end of the hearing the judge said that he is NOT inclinded to recommend a retroactive suspension of Direct Access to July 1, and that he didnt' think that the PUC commissioner assigned to the case was either. (Worried that he said too much, he then said he couldn't/shouldn't spead for the commissioner.) The judge, and the Commissioner who was at the hearing, went on at length abouth the fact that no one submitted their DA contracts to the PUC (as requested in the document the PUC issued asking folks to submit comments on the issues). Our attorney and the attorneys for suppliers and customers told them that 1) the Commission didn't need to see the actual contracts to get the information necessary via hearings to decide the issues and 2) the Commission doesn't have the authority to ask to see contracts and they ain't likely going to get them without a fight.   Though the probability many not be high, there is at least the chance that the Commission may try to subpoena folks to get the contracts.  Seems prudent to at least be prepared for the possiblity. Interestingly, Edison made a run at getting the Commission to implement by January 1 its proposal to charge all customers--DA and bundled alike--for Edison's undercollection.   The judge (literally) laughed off the request, and then said no.   As a result, Edison didn't get the leverage it was hoping for prior to our follow up meeting with them tomorrow to discuss the Negative CTC issue. The judge also gave the DWR representative a pretty good thrashing, e.g., ""why are you here, you refuse to be a party, you refuse to provide info,"" etc. From today's hearing it appears that DWR will come under increasing pressure to open the kimono and have its numbers scrutinized.   In related news, Davis has announced that he's asked Sempra to meet to renegotiate their DWR contract and said that he'd thus far met with two other generators in ""serious negotitations.""","jeff.dasovich@enron.com, jeremy.blachman@enron.com, d..steffes@enron.com,   richard.shapiro@enron.com, j..kean@enron.com, paul.kaufman@enron.com,   dan.leff@enron.com, evan.hughes@enron.com, vicki.sharp@enron.com,   c..williams@enron.com, janet.dietrich@enron.com,   diann.huddleson@enron.com, mike.smith@enron.com,   lamar.frazier@enron.com, michael.tribolet@enron.com,   lisa.mellencamp@enron.com, wanda.curry@enron.com,   steve.swain@enron.com",susan.mara@enron.com,RE: Update on California PUC Hearing--DA Suspension -- Further  Clarification --11.07.01,2001-11-07 22:35:01-08:00,sent

Please provide your comments no later than noon PST on November 8, 2001.   There are several changes, all of which are cosmetic.  In summary:     1.  Douglass has been added as an attorney of record so it is not necessary to obtain substitutions.  Instead, we will file an association of counsel which does not have to be signed by the party.     2.  The Rules of Court are unclear regarding page length.  Since one set of rules could limit the length to 30 pages, I decided to stay within that limit.  This was done by restructuring the pleading, reducing the lines to 1.5 rather than 2 spaces, and editing.       3.  There has been no sacrifice of substance.  In fact, I added the nine factual questions enumerated by Bilas to show why hearings were necessary.   Tomorrow we will complete the Exhibit Folio and Motion for the Supreme Court to judicially notice certain exhibits:  rhe January 17 Proclamation by Davis, Resolution No. 46 and the Preferred Policy Decision.  We will also insert the page references for the exhibits.   Everything will be delivered to the copy service at noon to make the required copies for filing and service and to bind the pleadings.

"New West has indeed adopted SCE's position hook-line-and-sinker.  I left Janie a very pointed e-mail on this topic.  They have no customers receiving commodity from them, so, I guess, in the short term, they are not harmed.  It is, noehteless, an unprincipled position.  A key quote from the filing:  ""It is the position of New West Energy that all customers, both bundled service customers and direct access customers, are equally responsible for payment of the net undercollections.  Fairness dictates that bundled customers and direct access customers are both assessed their fair share of the responsibility for repaying the amount of the net undercollections as may be determined by the Commission.""  -----Original Message----- From: jsmollon@newwestenergy.com [mailto:jsmollon@newwestenergy.com] Sent: Monday, November 12, 2001 10:25 AM To: smara@enron.com Subject: FW: Supplemental PHC Stmt of New West     -----Original Message----- From: Analene.Arellano@sce.com [mailto:Analene.Arellano@sce.com] Sent: Thursday, November 08, 2001 4:46 PM To: jsmollon@newwestenergy.com Subject: Supplemental PHC Stmt of New West   (See attached file: Document1.doc)","jeff.dasovich@enron.com, michael.tribolet@enron.com, wanda.curry@enron.com,   lisa.mellencamp@enron.com",susan.mara@enron.com,FW: Supplemental PHC Stmt of New West,2001-11-12 11:09:32-08:00,sent

"Tom, Diann and Michael,  I gave Peter Ouberg a call but then I read the PG&E rep's answer again ..  I think Tom Heckman misinterpreted what Rod Lee said.  I agree with Rod Lee.  He did not say that Enron could not submit DASRs -- he said we had to have the account on the list and if we did then the DASR would be processed.  If we did not have the account on the list, there would have to be some verification that the contract was signed on or before 9/20/01.  Enron and the other ESPs previously agreed with this approach (although the utilities did not fully buy into it).  I believe Diann submitted the account information, as we had agreed, on Nov 1. I take a little bit of issue with the comment that they will reject DASRs for accounts not on the Nov 1 list until the contract is verified, but I believe it follows the general spirit of what we agreed to at the meeting with ESPs and utilities on Oct 2.  I think Mr. Heckman thought he was being told that he could not add new facilities, but that's not how I read the reply from Mr. Lee.  So, I called Peter Ouberg back and said told him there didn't appear to be a problem after all, but that I would let him know if one cropped up.  IF you would like me to speak to Mr. Heckman, I would be happy to do so.

"Guys,  At the Board meeting yesterday, WPTF agreed to consider being involved in the utility procurement case.  AReM is also reviewing its participation as is IEP.  IEP should play a major role -- they have serious concerns that the CPUC will attempt to reinstate integrated resource planning and the evil BRPU.  WPTF will have its attorney review the utility filings due on November 21, and prepare summary comments for WPTF as a starting point for detrrmining the WPTF position. The board agreed to hold a teleconference on November 28 to decide on its position.  With all these groups involved, I think Enron will be able to coordinate its issues through them and avoid being in the case separately.

"I spoke with SDG&E's attorney on the question of why we received no notice on the switch of our customers to duel billing.  He told me that SDG&E did not believe notice was required under the tariff.  The link below is the ESP tariff, called Rule 25 for SDG&E. I also asked how it would be implemented.  The letter says the switch is effective 2 pm today.  He was not clear but it appears switches will take place on the billing date for each customer.  He did not know whether the switches will all be prospective or if they plan to go back to the last bill date.  I expressed surprise with the notion that they could go back in time.  He said he would have someone call me who is more knowledgable on the details.   http://www2.sdge.com/tariff/elec/ERULE25.pdf","d..smith@enron.com, vicki.sharp@enron.com, jeremy.blachman@enron.com,   kevin.keeney@enron.com, lamar.frazier@enron.com,   diann.huddleson@enron.com, evan.hughes@enron.com,   c..williams@enron.com",susan.mara@enron.com,SDG&E Conversation,2001-11-29 16:01:28-08:00,sent
