"Look a paragraph 3.5 in the Alliance.  It says once ECT submits an Energy  Proposal, FJ has the option of (1) doing the project,, (2) consider a  modified proposal, or (3) do nothing with the proposal.

"Kevin,  Good point with Naheola Energy Island, but this may also apply to several  other energy projects that have occurred over the past two years.  The Kzoo Steam Turbines, the RO Project at Marathon, etc...  Also Kevin and Richard given the fact that Naheola was not a wholly owned  asset by FJ (50%), but rather an LLP with another party (Utilico) - is this asset in  any way exempt from the Alliance Agreement from FJ's perspective?

"On Tues. 9/21 I met with Phil Zirngibl, the Alliance manager for Ft. James.   I informed him Enron wanted the original $10mm back.  It was our belief that   FJ did not act in good faith in ""expeditiously and fairly evaluating"" all of  Enron's energy proposals.  Phil argued that Enron saw substantial revenue  from the commodity (gas & coal) deals that were executed.  I argued that  commodity deals were never the ""intent"" of the Alliance as outlined in the  ""Objectives of the Parties.""  I told him we didn't need an Alliance agreement  to do commodity deals.  Phil was only prepared to argue the definition of ""substantial assets"" as it  related to the asset sale.  I told him Kalamazoo was substantial to us  because that was where we had a significant energy project.  It was also  substantial because the mill was ranked in the top 3 in terms of natural gas  consumption.  FJ let us work on the Kzoo project for 9 months before  informing us the mill would be sold.  I told Phil this is not how Alliance  partners treat each other.  I asked Phil if he was prepared to offer any proposal to resolve the  situation.  His response was FJ was happy with the Alliance and wanted to  continue with it ""as is.""  My response was that was not acceptable to Enron.  I told him the list of potential mediators for the dispute was being sent to  their counsel Greg Chaffee.  Next Steps:  I think we need to pick out a couple of strong project examples to use in our  case to present to the mediator.  Rather than just show the list of potential  deals Enron pitched and the lost opportunity value, I think a stronger case  to get our original $10mm back is to say here are 3 examples, here is the  value to both parties, and FJ still did not do the project (or they chose to  do it themselves).  This should go a long way to proving ""bad faith"".    I will get with David Barr and start assembling this information along with  the entire project list and the various ""reasons"" FJ chose not to do the  projects.  Based on this initial meeting, if the parties can't resolve the dispute  within 30 days, the dispute goes to non-binding mediation.  The parties are  to meet with the mediator within 21 days of the dispute being referred to the  mediator.  Per the Alliance agreement, the mediation meeting should take  place anytime between now and November 10.  Let me know if you have questions.

"Kevin,  Good summary!  I think in addition to putting together the three cases as you discussed  below, I think we may also want / need to show how the FJ's ""savings target"" that they  told us we had to meet was constantly changing over the two years (from $100k  annually to $225k to $500k to $1mm then my latest project from $1.5-2mm).  I think this correlates to what you are depicting in the cases.  It almost appears  everytime we had a potential project which may be able to reach X dollars in savings to FJ  they would raise it.  Please provide questions or comments.  Thanks.  Regards, David Barr  Kevin Hyatt wrote:  > On Tues. 9/21 I met with Phil Zirngibl, the Alliance manager for Ft.  James.

Although ECT Houston cancelled the Alliance on Aug 16th, 1999, Fort James  have communicated to us the conditions of their best proposal, as follows:   - Contracting Quantity: 250 GWh a year - Delivery Period: 1st Jan 2000-31st Dec. 2000 (both included) - On site delivery to the two eligible sites of Gien (115GWh) and Hondouville  (135 GWh) on the 90Kv grid - The supplier will have full responsability of the supply to the sites,  including transmission and metering system - Contracting Price: FRF 18.8 cts/Kwh, including transmission, balancing  power, tax and back-up  Current contracting capacities for the sites of Gien and Hondouville are  respectively 15MW (min 11MW, max 20MW) and 18.6MW (min 14.6MW, max 22MW).  Load factor is 85%.      Load shapes for the two sites are not available. We have only obtained  aggregate load shapes for their four sites in France. Fort James is a  paper-making company, producing paper towels, napkins, plates, cups, bath and  facial tissue. Power consumption is therefore erratic but paper jams doesn't  cause the plants to stop.  They made it very clear that they wanted full requirement for this year, due  to the transitionnal regime.

"Enron OnLine Capacity Auction Bidding opened on Thursday 6/22; no bids have been received as yet but  several shippers have indicated interest and plan on responding on Monday  6/26.  Bids close at 2pm Monday 6/26.  Coincidentally, we received a call  from Unbound Technology, a developer of wireless software technology.   UnBound provides software architecture  that creates the connection between  transaction processes and wireless services.  This potentially would allow TW  to extend our e-commerce services beyond the desktop  to a wireless user  through a customized, wireless interface (pagers, cell phones, etc.).

El Paso Merchant Energy is expected to provide Transwestern a  proposal, early next week, for the potential monetization of the fuel  component for their company's transportation contracts totaling 65,000 Dth/d  of San Juan to California capacity.  Southern Company Energy Marketing John Hogan was in town this week.  Southern has advanced to the second round  of bidding on Nevada Power's generation assets which are scheduled to be sold  off by the end of this year.  SCEM's Gallup agreement allows them to deliver  to the new SWG delivery point on an alternate basis, but if Southern is  successful in obtaining any of Nevada Power's gen assets, they may request to  amend the delivery point on their Gallup contract.  SCEM is also very  interested in any expansions TW may have in the near future.  Due to their  affiliation with Vastar, they have a definite appetite for more San Juan to  CA or NV transport.  Southern is interested in the possibility of buying options for capacity on  TW and we requested that he get his regulatory group familiar with the idea  in hopes that SCEM would support of our filing.  SCEM also plans to trigger its ROFR on their Ignacio to Blanco capacity  (30,000/d) by the 7/1 deadline.  Duke They have triggered their ROFR on the Ignacio to Blanco capacity (18,000/d)  and this capacity will be posted on the Internet per TW's tariff the week of  7/3.

"USGT Sold 20,000 MMBtu/d of Daily Firm space moving gas for the weekend from PG&E  Topock to SoCal Needles at $.10/MMBtu.  This was somewhat of a novel deal in  that the California price spreads opened up and gas became trapped at PG&E.   Once our station 4 compressor becomes fully operational, this opportunity  will likely dry up.    Enron N.A. Representatives contacted us this week to discuss our possible participation  in a gas storage field using a depleted reservoir on Navajo land near  Farmington, NM.  Third party developers approached ENA looking for assistance  in moving the project forward.  New Tariff Services Marketing consensus was reached to delay any further development of  Transwestern's Hourly Firm Service until the potential markets of power plant  loads become operational.  During this interim period, Park 'n Ride services  provided on an intra-day basis shall be priced incrementally higher than Park  'n Ride services provided on a timely basis.  Any resulting market response  will provide indications of market willingness to pay premium transport rates  for hourly transportation service.  El Paso  El Paso Merchant Services needs to re-scrub their verbal offer to  Transwestern of a $15 Million lump sum ""pre-payment"" option of fuel  monetization for their combined 65,000 MMBtu/d of San Juan to California  capacity.

"USGT Sold 20,000 MMBtu/d of Daily Firm space moving gas for the weekend from PG&E  Topock to SoCal Needles at $.10/MMBtu.  This was somewhat of a novel deal in  that the California price spreads opened up and gas became trapped at PG&E.   Once our station 4 compressor becomes fully operational, this opportunity  will likely dry up.    Enron N.A. Representatives contacted us this week to discuss our possible participation  in a gas storage field using a depleted reservoir on Navajo land near  Farmington, NM.  Third party developers approached ENA looking for assistance  in moving the project forward.  New Tariff Services Marketing consensus was reached to delay any further development of  Transwestern's Hourly Firm Service until the potential markets of power plant  loads become operational.  During this interim period, Park 'n Ride services  provided on an intra-day basis shall be priced incrementally higher than Park  'n Ride services provided on a timely basis.  Any resulting market response  will provide indications of market willingness to pay premium transport rates  for hourly transportation service.

The best college football team in America this season will run the most bas= ic of offenses. Call the option many things: plain, boring, ancient, uninspire= d. But when Nebraska runs it, it=01,s cruel and usual punishment for opposing defenses.  Teams may be able to slow it down, but over the course of four quarters, th= ey will pay a price, slammed repeatedly by an offensive line that averages 303 pounds. Remember the limp noodles crawling out of Sun Devil Stadium in January? That was Tennessee=01,s defense after the Cornhuskers drove 99 yar= ds in the fourth quarter of the Fiesta Bowl.  The beauty of the system is that it is the perfect offense for the current rage of defenses using quick, blitzing attacks. Sure, you can send everybod= y after the ball, but the option demands you stop and think and play an assignment. How do you properly scout a team that runs an offense you see only once a year? The answer is you don=01,t.  Arguably, the Cornhuskers, FOXSports.com's No. 1 team in its preseason Top 25, were playing the best football in the country by the end of the 1999 season. In their last five games, the Cornhuskers beat Texas A&M, Kansas State, Colorado, Texas and Tennessee by a cumulative score of 164-72. The scary thing about Nebraska is that 10 offensive starters return for a team that finished 12-1 last season.  The Cornhuskers have an unquenchable desire to be the best again. It starts in the off-season and continues through January. The running game took a while to materialize last season because of injuries, but I-back Dan Alexander and quarterback Eric Crouch have the ability to rush for 1,000 yards this season. Even if the oft-injured Alexander can=01,t hold up to th= e pounding, the Cornhuskers have a replacement with great credentials and a fitting name for this smashmouth football team: Thunder Collins.  Nebraska will not only push other teams around. The Cornhuskers will push themselves. The school is touting guard Russ Hochstein and center Dominic Raiola for the Outland Trophy, presented to the nation's outstanding interi= or lineman. The beneficiary of this internal competition is the offense.  ""This group has a great deal of confidence that always shows come August an= d September,"" said Nebraska coach Frank Solich, who has his best team since taking over for Tom Osborne three years ago. ""We have a rich history and a team coming off a good season that is not questioning things.  ""We have high expectations. Some of it comes from how we finished last season. A lot comes from playing in an excellent program and tradition.""  The option and the 'Huskers are inextricably bound. It is their offense, an= d they have been running it so long it is practically an open-book test for defensive coordinators. Yet, only eight teams have passed the test over the last seven years. Nebraska has won 81 games and three national titles in th= at span.  ""We try to keep up with what=01,s current and we use the spring to experime= nt,"" Solich said. ""But our players and coaches like to line up and beat you. Our players that are here love it. It is an aggressive style of play and that= =01,s how they want to play it. It=01,s what our players want to do on offense.""  The Cornhuskers will not go through the season unchallenged. Crouch can put his name up there with the Turner Gill, Tommie Frazier and Scott Frost for the title of best Nebraska quarterback ever, but all bets are off for this team if Crouch is hurt, because the Cornhuskers lack depth at quarterback.  The schedule has its pitfalls too. Notre Dame, looking for a win that can restore luster and a reason to keep coach Bob Davie, gets Nebraska at home = on Sept. 9. A resurgent Oklahoma team and top rival Kansas State get Nebraska = at their places. Kansas State won the last time the teams met in Manhattan.  The Cornhuskers will probably play Texas or Oklahoma in the Big 12 championship game, which has had a tendency to produce a surprise finish.  The Cornhuskers also must shore up a secondary that loses Ralph and Mike Brown. But Nebraska Carlos Polk back as the heart of the defense. Polk is heralded by Nebraska insiders as the best linebacker in school history.  But come January 3, Nebraska will play Florida State for the national title= . And the Seminoles too will fall under the relentless attack.   Senior writer Darryl Richards covers college football for FOXSports.com. Se= nd your comments to Darryl Richards.

"Caithness - Confidentiality agreements were sent this week to the project  developers of the 550Mw Big Sandy project in northwest Arizona.  Work  continues on developing pipe lateral costs and environmental impact  statements.  KN Energy - Their current transport contract to the West has a ROFR that  expires 7/31.  The 20,000 MMBtu/d capacity is split evenly between Topock and  Needles (KN is not currently flowing anything to Topock) at a rate of  $.13/MMBtu.  Even with the Topock space, the total capacity could be worth  something in the low to mid $.20's.  KN would also like to keep the ROFR  language but this could only occur with a max rate deal for a term of one  year or longer.  We should have any offer from KN by Monday 7/31.  Operations - we temporarily lost a compressor for approximately 1 hour at  Station 2 on Thursday.  There was minimal throughput impacted.  An unusual  ""knock"" sound has also been coming from one of the units at Station 4.  High  western flow is taking its toll on equipment.  August Capacity - West demand is expected to be robust for August (higher  than June) with high temperatures combined with lower hydro-generation  capacity available from the Northwest (per CERA).  El Paso / Blanco Mis-Measurement - A letter was drafted this week for Stan's  signature for delivery to El Paso's management.  The letter outlines the  circumstances and chronology of events leading up to our meeting with El Paso  in June.  The letter requests a payback of all the gas volume.  Stan has  opted not attach a copy of the lawsuit filing to the letter.   Reliant - Extended their Flex Firm (Primary Receipt and Primary Delivery at  the West Texas Pool) from July to August 2000 for $.03, but increased volumes  from 10,000 MMBtu/day to 20,000 MMBtu/day.   ENA / Citizens Utilities - The new Citizens interconnect for the Griffith  power plant was scheduled to be purged and filled with gas this week.  As  manager of Citizen's transport agreement, ENA has notified us verbally they  will request some or all of the 25,000 MMBtu/d of primary delivery capacity  for that point.  As soon as we receive their request in writing, we will  discuss strategy with legal and regulatory to evaluate all TW's options.  Duke Atoka-Crawford Proposal - For a $750,000 construction contribution from  TW, Duke is willing to build out part of their gathering system to unload  20,000 MMBtu/d off the Atoka lateral and re-deliver gas to TW's Crawford  lateral.  TW would receive a 5 year FT at a rate of $.05 plus actual fuel.   Oasis would be the primary delivery point.  This project has the added  benefit of allowing TW to sell incremental space on the Atoka lateral.    In addition, Duke is proposing to install additional compression to deliver  up to 40,000 MMBtu/d of incremental volume to TW off the Zia plant.  In  exchange, TW would provide a discounted $.035 IT transport rate for a two  year term.  The Zia gas would flow through a new tap into TW's high pressure  30"" line.   This project has a fuel saving benefit to TW by eliminating one  stage of compression from the low pressure system.

Currently, the vibration level has increased.  The unit and lateral  efficiency are a continuing concern.  Operations plans to pull the unit apart  in early September for an evaluation.  At this time, the anticipated 30,000  MMBtu/d of ""additional"" capacity we hoped to have is now not available.   There is also concern that we may be unable to meet our currently subscribed  FT obligation.  El Paso All American - We attended the El Paso Pipeline meeting this week as  they described their FERC filing to begin the conversion of the All American  Pipeline from oil to gas.  They reiterated several times to attending  shippers that the project would not offer any incremental space to the main  line.  El Paso's filing centers around the cost and fuel savings from  decommissioning very old compressor equipment on their south system and  replacing the capacity with the All American line.  The cost figures  (conversion and acquisition) that El Paso filed tracked very closely with  what Transwestern estimated in its evaluation of the pipe.  The in-service  date is expected to be July 1, 2001.  Transport Options - TW Commercial reps met with marketing and regulatory  personnel from Burlington Resources, Conoco, and Texaco this week to review  the proposed Transport Options Tariff filing.  The meeting was very positive  and constructive.  Several suggestions were made that led to the realization  that the best course of action would be to delay the actual tariff filing and  have a working group meeting in the Houston office.  Everyone agreed that as  much preliminary work as possible should be done before the filing to make  the whole process less contentious and to garner more customer support for  the tariff.  We are trying to schedule the working group session for the  third week of August.  Crawford Lateral - A line leak on the lateral this week reduced flow from  50,000 MMBtu/d to zero.  Operations initially estimated 2-3 days of down time  but actually only required 12 hours.  Approximately 55 feet of line was  replaced.  El Paso Measurement Letter - Stan Horton forwarded the ""mis-measurement""  letter to El Paso management this week.  We will follow up in approximately  two weeks if they don't respond sooner.  Operator Imbalances - Met with Market Services personnel to review operator  imbalances across TW's system.  Marketing is supportive of Gas Control's  efforts to limit the imbalances and begin allocations if operators schedule  gas and then can't deliver.  With proactive balance management, there is  opportunity to realize greater Park 'N Ride revenue.  TransColorado Shipper Meeting - Kevin Hyatt will be attending the  TransColorado shipper meeting this week in Boulder.  Christine Stokes  attended the Colorado Oil & Gas Association meeting.

"Summary of COGA conference follows.  FYI - at the time of the conference, the  conference organizers indicated that all speakers presentations would be made  available at the COGA.org websit after the conference.  However, COGA is  currently experiencing difficulties in actually getting each speaker to  provide this information.  I have requested a copy of the Interstate Pipeline  (CIG/Questar/El Paso/Transcolorado/Western/NWPL) presentations to be mailed  to me and will circulate them when I receive them.  They provide interesting  summaries of pipeline expansion programs.   Main conference themes which seem to be repeated among various speackers  include the following points:    -  Annual U.S. domestic requirements are headed towards the 30 TCF point  sooner than expected.  One attributable reason for the higher than expected  growth rate was the impact of growing internet & cellular activity of the  nation.  It was estimated that these combined markets have grown from  representing 2% of total electrical requirements of the nation to  approximately an 8-10% range which will be sustainable from this point  forward.  In addition, overall healthy economic growth of the nation also  contributes to the increase in domestic gas demand.     -   Power River Basin coalbed methane production has the highest potential  growth opportunity for Rocky production.  -   Currently the companies most active in Rocky Mountain exploration &  production are experiencing a shortage of geologists, engineers, and field  personnel which they fear may impact the desired rate of field  developement  - Rig counts in the Rockies are on the rise, but additional rig availability  is also an issue which may impact rate of production. - The only pipelines which actively promoted access to Waha markets for Rocky  production were El Paso and Transcolorado. - El Paso was already encouraging interest in the 1.2 BCF of capacity which  El Paso Merchant Services currently has on their system which will expire  October 01.  - General conference discussion opinion is that the  Alliance in-service  impact will be fairly neutral to market demand and gas prices for Rocky  production.  They continue to be optimistic with their growth opportunities  and price expectations.   Customer Meetings:  Western Gas Resources - met with Bill Koch (project developer), Chris O'Dell  (Texas gas marketer), Andrew Carter and Andrew Richmond (western region gas  marketers).  Western is in the process of purchasing some NNG lines which are  in close proximity to the most southern part of Transwestern's West Texas  lateral.   Western would eventually like to deliver treated gas into this  line,  once Traswestern cleans the line and finalizes the Gomez to Puckett  Tie-Over, in order to access our Waha markets.    Upside potential exists to  eventually have access to two Western plants  totaling approximately 150  MMcf/d of supplies through this arrangement.    TW would most likely have to  enter into some form of transportation agreement with Western in order to  justify the $2MM price tag for the Gomez to Puckett Tie-Over.  Aquila - Met with Tori Campbell, Goerge Nunnemaker, Mark Magliery and Nick  Thomas to discuss general TW issues.

"NGTS, whose main headquarters is located in Dallas, has a one-man office  located in Colorado Springs, Colorado.  John Rohde purchases gas from 30  small to medium sized suppliers in the Rocky Mountain area and either acts as  their agent or moves their purchased gas to markets for NGTS.  Most of this  gas generally either goes to the Rocky markets or to Northern Natural  pipeline.  NGTS holds CIG capacity, and I have encouraged John to look at any  future potential of making deliveries off CIG into TW at Tumbleweed.  John  also indicated that he thought NGTS does have some equity San Juan gas  which  currently flows on El Paso to California via capacity release.   I will  pursue this fact with the proper individual in the Dallas office.  ",kevin.hyatt@enron.com,christine.stokes@enron.com,Customer Meeting,2000-08-17 05:10:00-07:00,received

"Deals Closed--  --Arizona Public Service - We sold 14,000 MMBtu/d to APS for April  - Oct,  2001 from EOT - Topock for $0.23.  This was the space we had tried   to sell  using the IOS last week.  The high bid then had been $.138/MMBtu and we  rejected the offer.  APS had not been a bidder in the IOS.   --CIMA Energy agreed to an IT agreement for 5000 MMBtu/d on the Crawford  lateral.  This is an East-to-East deal at $0.065 plus fuel for 14 months    beginning Sept 2000.  This new shipper on TW will generate additional revenue  (had shipped under a Duke FT for $0.02).   --Texaco has agreed to extend its contract from Red Cedar to Blanco from  January 1, 2001 through December 31, 2002 at $0.045.   --Red Cedar - We have a verbal agreement on a 5 year deal with Red Cedar.   Final details are being negotiated but the volume would range from  100,000  to 150,000 MMBtu/d.  We will need to spend approximately $375,000 to expand  the metering capability of the Arkansas loop.   --Sempra has agreed to an FT agreement for Ignacio to Blanco for 30,000  MMBtu/d.  The term is calendar 2001 for a $.06 rate.  We have approximately   30,000 MMBtu/d of remaining space available.  Burlington Resources - Burlington claims we are limiting production from  their Val Verde Plant because TW is unable to fully accept all the  nominations of gas under the current operating agreement.  They claim  approximately $135,000/month in lost revenues.  We are pulling together the  data on exactly which days we have not been able to take BR's gas.  Thus far  BR has rejected our revised wording in the interconnect amendment,  specifically ""best efforts"" and ""subject to operating conditions on TW"", so  we will need to revise this further.  We offered alternate receipt point  flexibility at Ignacio and alternate delivery point flexibility at El Paso  Blanco on their Jackrabbit contract but they do not think this is sufficient  to agree to amend the interconnect agreement.  They have suggested we  consider giving them a deeper discount on their San Juan - Waha contract  (80,000/d, $0.14, term 11/30/06) but this is not acceptable to TW.  We are  evaluating all options.  SouthWest Gas notified us they are within 90 days of being capable of  receiving gas through the new interconnect in Nevada.  Under the terms of the  agreement, we are now obligated to pay SWG the remaining CAIC of $417,500.

"El Paso Field Services - EPFS has agreed to go forward on a new interconnect  with TW in Eddy County, NM.  The size of the new interconnect will be 40,000  MMBtu/d.  EPFS has agreed to pay $165,000 towards the cost estimate of  $280,000 as well as commit 12,500 MMBtu/d throughput for a period of 2  years.  Facility Planning is opening a new work order and we have begun  drafting the Interconnect Agreement and the OBA for the new point.  The point  should be active in 60 - 90 days.  Arizona Public Service - has still not signed the Transport Request for the  14,000 MMBtu/d April - October 2001 capacity.  The current spread is $0.375 -  $0.40.    Red Cedar - has finally decided on their transport volume under our new 5  year agreement.  Contract documentation is being prepared.  Sempra - has again exercised their option under their Gallup contract for  21,500 MMBtu/d Permian to California for 1 year starting 11/1/01. The  contract rate is $0.30 plus fuel.  Texaco is moving up to 100,000 MMBtu/d from PG&E Topock to Mojave starting  8/21 through 10/31/00.  TW collected an incremental $.025/MMBtu for this move  or approximately $160,000.  El Paso Outage-  Current reports are the Office of Pipeline Safety is demanding El Paso hydro  test, X-ray and ultrasonic test all 330 miles of pipe that is currently out  of service due to last weekend's explosion.  It appears the 1 Bcf/d capacity  to California may be off-line for up to one month.    Related Developments   --SoCal released capacity on El Paso for October 2000 to Dynegy at a  reservation charge of $1.00/MMBtu.   --Volume on various TW interconnect points has picked up on the east end  including the new NGPL Winkler point.   --We are receiving incremental volume from El Paso at Window Rock and  collecting a portion of the market premium.   Transport Options - a working group meeting with customers has been scheduled  for Thursday August 31.

Burlington Resources - We held a conference call with John Hinton, Marketing  Director, regarding the current operation of the Val Verde plant.

SoCal Windowing - a conference call was held with Mike Nelson, Rich Jolly,  Steve January, Terry Galassini, Darrell Schoolcraft, Ray Smith, Gary Choquet,  and David Roentsch regarding TW's pressures and delivery capability at SoCal  Needles.  Analysis indicates we have 35 pounds of pressure drop from our  Needles measurement station to the SoCal station across the river  (approximately two miles).  SoCal maintains that if we can give them 830 psi  at their station, they can take the full 750,000 MMBtu under the contract  (this translates to 870 psi at TW's meter with our current situation).  Our  problem has been if we lose volume out of San Juan or a unit on the West of  Thoreau leg, then we lose line pack and then pressure at the border.  SoCal  acknowledges they have a motor out of service at Needles but plan to have it  back on line in October.  But they maintain this won't help resolve the  situation.  Operations has agreed to look at a number of things including  changing the type of meter at Needles, looking at some station valve  replacement, and mechanical condition of stations 1 through 4.  Marketing  agreed to estimate the revenue impact of the pressure drop and lower volume  delivery to help justify any capital expenditures.

"El Paso Pipeline Update - The US Dept. of Transportation approved reinstating  gas service for El Paso's Line 1100 damaged in the recent explosion.  This  brought 400 million cfd of capacity back on stream to the California border.   The ruptured Line 1103 will not be repaired until further investigations have  been completed.  The availability of Line 1100 capacity had the following  basis impact:  Permian to California basis for October dropped from Monday by  $1.30/MMBtu while November '00 - March '01 and April - October '01 narrowed  by $0.43 and $0.37 respectively.  Also, TW shippers are no longer using El  Paso Window Rock as a receipt point on our system.  Transport Options Program - Representatives from 7 companies comprising a  majority of TW's larger shippers attended our workshop on this new tariff  filing.  All attendees were given in advance of the meeting a draft copy of  the proposed filing for their review and comment.  The TW Team (Jeff Fawcett  and Susan Scott) did an outstanding job of preparing the material, answering  questions, and anticipating shipper concerns related to this new service.   The only serious objections raised  by the customers were concerns related  to: (1) potential abuses by marketing affiliates and (2) hoarding of option  capacity by any one shipper.  Among the  solutions proposed were restricting  Enron affiliates  access to the program and limiting the volume of  outstanding options any one shipper can hold.  At the end of the meeting, we  asked for final comments to be submitted to TW by next week in anticipation  of filing the tariff with the FERC in mid-September.  KN/Oneok Contract -  We negotiated a 12 month max rate agreement with Oneok  for 20,000 MMBtu/d of west flow capacity starting February 1, 2001.  We also  negotiated in the contract a provision whereby if Oneok releases any of the  capacity above the max rate, then TW shares 50/50 in the incremental revenue.  EOG Resources - We are negotiating a new transport agreement with EOG for  incremental volume they could bring into TW's West Texas lateral.  Initially,  the volume was 4 - 5,000 MMBtu/d but now may be at least 15,000 MMBtu/d.  EOG  is reviewing the proposed interconnect and operating agreement.  EOG has not  typically held transport capacity on TW in the past.  September Pipe Outage - We are trying to accommodate west flowing shippers  whose transport will be cut from September 6-10 due to DOT testing on  Transwestern.  The plan is to facilitate the use of PG&E Market Center  storage to supply west markets during the outage.  Volume may be as high as  20 -50,000 MMBtu/d at an incremental rate for TW of $.05 -.08/MMBtu. ",bullets@enron.com,kevin.hyatt@enron.com,Bullets 9/1,2000-09-01 04:08:00-07:00,sent
"Team-- in my absence please submit additional bullets this week to Audrey by  10:00 am Fri.  thanks  Main Line West Outage - West flow capacity has been reduced by approximately  200,000 MMBtu/d for five days beginning 9/6 for pipeline testing.  To  accommodate the market and customer needs, we have negotiated transport for  50,000 MMBtu/day from PG&E to Needles for Max Rate of $.25 for the five day  outage.  We also did a Market Center lend for 40,000 MMBtu/day @ $0.10.   Estimated incremental revenue for the 5 day outage at this time is $82,500.

All executed documents have been received.  FERC / California Power Prices - The FERC plans to convene a public meeting  the week of September 11 in California to take comments from interested  parties regarding the recent price spikes of wholesale electricity and power  transmission in the state.  In addition, SoCal Edison filed a motion late  last week with the California Public Utility Commission seeking emergency  relief from high spot gas prices on which its power purchase rates are based.  The company told the CPUC that Southern California Border (Topock, AZ) prices  in the last month have risen by $2.50/MMBtu possibly because of market  manipulation, in particular the withholding off of the market of pipeline  transportation capacity between the supply basins and the California border.   ""There is substantial and compelling evidence that the basis differential has  been and continues to be grossly distorted by market power abuse, collusion  and affiliate self dealing of out-of-state gas suppliers and merchants,""  Edison told the CPUC.   The company noted the CPUC already has filed a Section 5 complaint with FERC  regarding this issue and is seeking a recision of ""certain allegedly  collusive contracts which it contends have permitted out-of-state natural gas  suppliers and their affiliates to drive up artificially California border gas  prices by wrongfully withholding capacity."" It notes the complaint  ""conservatively estimates that the anti-competitive manipulation of the basis  differential has already damaged California gas and electricity users by $100  million annually since the beginning of 1998.""

"PNM - The FERC accepted TW's new tariff filing for purchasing capacity on  PNM's Blanco to Rio Puerco line!!!  The acceptance is conditioned by TW being  limited to acquire this off-system capacity to the Apr-Oct period and we must  file a report with the Commission at the end of the 2 year period detailing  what impact, if any, this proposal has had on the market.  El Paso Blanco Mis-Measurement - El Paso pipeline called this week and agreed  with TW that they had been erroneously calibrating their Blanco meter for the  last several years and did in fact owe TW gas volume.  They would like to  offset the balance owed TW against volume NNG owes El Paso.  Market Services  is verifying the net volume figures.  The settlement volume proposed by El  Paso is 91% of everything we requested.  We will attempt to take the  approximately 651,000 MMBtu back at Window Rock over a 30 day period  beginning in October.  Arizona Public Service - We have re-negotiated their FT agreement prior to  the ROFR being triggered at the end of September.  APS will renew its 8,000  MMBtu/d Permian to Needles agreement at the max rate for one year as well as  the provision if they release the capacity at greater than max rate, TW and  APS will share the upside 50/50.  Red Cedar Gathering - We received the signed letter agreement from Red Cedar  which commits them to full reimbursement of the capital expense necessary to  increase the Arkansas Loop meter from 200,000 MMBtu to 300,000 MMBtu/d.  We  expect this meter increase to be completed and flowing in excess of the  current 200,000 MMBtu/d by January 1, 2001.  System Expansions - We have updated our cost estimates and RAROC for  expansions of the I-B Link, Blanco to Thoreau and mainline segments of the  pipe.  We will follow up with PNM today on cost comparisons.  The TW  expansion appears to be more cost effective than PNM's.   The BP Amoco/Vastar merger is set for completion today.  Amoco will begin  marketing Vastar's equity gas beginning 11/1/00.  Amoco has expressed a high  level of interest on the remaining capacity from Ignacio to Blanco and from  Red Cedar to Blanco for 2001.  They will provide a firm offer to TW next week.  Line Outages: The September 13th allocation due to compressor failure in TW's West of  Thoreau Area allowed for 42,0000 MMBtu of IT volumes to flow from PG&E Topock  to Socal Needles.  Revenue generated at max rate equaled $10,500 to partially  offset the commodity and fuel loss.  EOG Resources - EOG executed the Interconnect and Operating agreement for the  15,000 MMBtu/d we expect from their new well.  Transwestern has initiated  landowner notifications which  takes at least 30 days.  We continue to  negotiate with EOG on becoming a new shipper and taking firm transport on TW.   Burlington Resources Val Verde Plant - TW's ability to accept the contracted  volume from the plant on a consistent basis continues to be an issue.  High  temperatures and volume flow in the San Juan region have reduced our  capacity.  BR is requesting relief to offset the monetary impact of gas that  was shut in or sold at lesser margins in other locations.

"Following up on my ""To Do"" from our conference call, the information below  may be useful as we attempt to justify capital / operational expenditures on  the TW system:  Objective:  Try and quantify in revenue terms the lost value of decreased  west throughput to TW  First a few assumptions: Fuel prices used were: Permian = $4.785/MMBtu and San Juan = $4.14/MMBtu Baseload volume flowing west was assumed to be 1,090,000 MMBtu/d Fuel consumed = 2% Revenue impact is based upon current contracts and assumes lost fuel and  commodity charges only.  TW continues to collect the reservation charges.  Result: Based on current gas fuel prices, for every 1000 MMBtu/d delivery we lose on  the west end, this translates to approximately $150/day of lost revenue.  If  we assume the pressure drop at station 1 is preventing us from delivering  25,000 MMBtu/d into SoCal, then the lost revenue for TW would be $3,305 per  day or $1,206,000 per year.  To give you an idea of the significance of the  fuel value, of the $3,305 daily revenue, approximately $3,072 of it is fuel  related.  One More Thing: We assume here that TW continues to collect the reservation charges.   However, on a long term basis, if the west condition continues, we run the  risk of losing the reservation as well.  Based on 25,000 MMBtu/d, this value  equals $2,500,000 per year.

We have proved that the pipeline can handle 850 MMcf/d  plus.  However, it has not been tested since the mainline hasn't moved 1090  MMcf/d yet after Gallup's installation.  Granted it appears that the San Juan  lateral has some form of irregularity in efficiency along part of the lateral  and that issue is still under investigation.  Once the lab tests are  completed we can better determine the next course of action.  Until then we  still believe that the pipeline is capable of transporting 850 MMcf/d on the  San Juan lateral at the same time move 1090 MMcf/d to California even though  the suction pressure to the Gallup station is not as high as it's design.   Unfortunately we can't test this theory at the worst possible time until next  summer.    Several other issues need to be addressed such as the transport of retained  fuel and increased throughput on the mainline.  Transporting retained fuel is  highly improbable because Gallup's compressor can only handle a maximum of  870 MMcf/d at best under good conditions.  EE&CC provided a compressor  capable of compressing the design volume only with no retained fuel.   Therefore if we can solve the inlet pressure problem we can compress up  to  870 which would basically transport the retained fuel.  Until then Gallup can  only compress as much as possible over the 850 MMcf/d when conditions  permit.  Increased mainline throughput West of Thoreau based on a higher  discharge pressure from Gallup is not possible.  Even though the electric  motor can develop more horsepower than needed, the compressor was designed  for 850 MMcf/d at 950 psig discharge.  Therefore the unit can not increase  it's discharge from the design pressure of 950 psig to 970 psig to allow  increased firm transportation west.  As for the San Juan Lateral pipeline efficiency, we have experienced a powder  substance in the lateral both times it was pigged.  We don't know the source  and a good guess is ""San Juan Basin"".  If that's the case, we need to find a  way to keep the lateral clean after a good cleaning process has been done.   What is El Paso doing if they have the same problem?  It's a touchy subject  to ask them.  If they don't have a problem (or won't admit it) t hen knowing  we do could be bad for TW.  Even though this was not apart of the main subject, there have been some  questions regarding if the mainline efficiency has changed (upward) from any  pigging activities this year.  The only pigging performed was smart pigging  between Station #4 & #5 for an incroachment issue.  This had no impact on  efficiencies west to California.  However, Compression Services is actively  working with Operations to implement recommendations made by Gary Choquette  (Omaha Facility Planning Team)  for units at Stations 1 & 2 . Once completed  over the next few weeks, this should improve unit performance and more  specifically minimize fuel use.

"Southwest Gas - Conversations with SWG indicate that somewhere along the  construction path for the interconnect, TW approved the installation of the  meter bypass piping (we are waiting for engineering to confirm this).  If  this is the case, we will ask SWG to install skillets or padlock the valves  so it cannot be used without TW approval.  In addition, we are proposing to  amend the start date of the SWG transport contract so that TW may resell the  unused space in early November on a daily firm basis.    USGT - US Gas Transportation is protesting the Market Center deal we  negotiated during our brief September outage.  We re-negotiated the original  invoice from $140,000 down to $113,000.  USGT has countered with $65,000  citing mis-communication on the original deal.  Plains Farmer's Co-op - Higher gas prices have created an additional level of  credit exposure across our customer base in terms of transportation  balancing.  For September, this small Co-op had accumulated a balance payable  to TW of approximately $440,000.  The customer indicated they would be  sending us a payment of $250,000 but so far has only sent in $75,000.

"Sempra - We sold a Nov - March FT contract to Sempra this week for 2,000  MMBtu/d from EOT to Panhandle.  The contract is a one-part rate for  $.07/MMBtu.  Red Cedar - We received the cash out payment of nearly $800,000 from Red  Cedar this week effectively clearing their imbalance owed to TW.  In  addition, they gave us verbal approval to begin scoping a new receivable  point to deliver approximately 50,000 MMBtu/d to TW south of La Plata.   Facility Planning is providing a cost estimate.  SouthWest Gas - has agreed to remove the new piece of pipe that bypasses the  new meter constructed near Las Vegas.  They have also agreed to amend the FT  contract begin date so TW can re-sell their capacity that they won't be able  to utilize due to their construction delays.  We are waiting on a new  contract begin date before we resell the space.  Transport Options Filing - The new tariff was filed with FERC on Tuesday Oct.  17.

"Makes sense.  Thanks df      Kevin Hyatt 10/24/2000 02:14 PM To: Drew Fossum/ET&S/Enron@ENRON cc:    Subject: New Power plants vs. rising gas costs  My thoughts are this:  those plants under development (i.e. past the planning stages and into  permitting or construction) will continue to move forward.  Their fuel costs  are most likely already locked in or there is a pass thru mechanism to the  power buyer.    It is really only the near term gas prices that are high in this  backward-dated market.  The 10 year gas price curve is still relatively  inexpensive.  Those power plant projects in early planning stages or those  with higher merchant risk will likely be delayed but that depends on where in  No. Americal they are located.  Those plants slated for severely constrained  NERC territories will probably continue to move forward, as evidenced by  recent announcements for new plants in the MAIN and WSCC regions.  just my thoughts, you get what you pay for.

"El Paso Blanco Mis-Measurement - The 518,000 MMBtu of gas agreed upon in our  settlement letter with El Paso has been paid back to TW as of October 25.    Southwest Gas - SWG agreed to amend the start date of their transport  contract to November 15.  TW resold the space along with an additional 1000  MMBtu/d for a total of 15,000 MMBtu/d to Sempra Energy at $0.15 (slightly  above market but equal to the rate SWG was originally paying).  Morgan  Gottsponer sold Sempra the gas for this transport deal.  Burlington Resources' Val Verde Plant - We held another conference call with  BR this week to finally resolve the outstanding issue of TW's obligation to  take 250,000 MMBtu/d from Burlington's Val Verde plant.  Operational  restrictions and San Juan temperatures seasonally affect the amount of volume  TW is capable of receiving from Val Verde.  BR had claimed damages of nearly  $3,000,000 from having to sell San Juan gas into less attractive markets  because TW could not take all their volume.    Upon investigation, there were actually very few days in which TW hampered  Burlington's deliveries; but TW does have an exposure here for a contractual  commitment that operationally we cannot meet on a year-round basis without  spending several million dollars for additional compression.   In exchange  for Burlington signing an amended operating agreement that meets both parties  needs, TW has agreed to refund $100,000 of transport charges to BR for gas  they moved this summer down the San Juan lateral.  Transport Options Program - Comments and interventions on this filing are due  from interested parties by the close of business Monday October 30th.    Duke Energy - We are working on a 100,000 MMBtu/d east-to-east transport deal  with Duke beginning in January 2001 for one to two years at a rate of $.02  -.03.  This deal would justify the capital expenditure to replace the coolers  at WT-2 and give TW another 50,000 MMBtu/d flow capacity on the west Texas  lateral.  However, Duke wants alternative flow capability west to the border  at an incremental $.06.  As an alternative, we are proposing an index-based  sharing mechanism for the west flow but Duke is balking (current market for  calendar 2001 net of fuel is $.205).",bullets@enron.com,kevin.hyatt@enron.com,Bullets 10/27,2000-10-26 08:40:00-07:00,sent

"New Mexico Train De-railment - Most of this week was spent helping customers  re-route gas as the train derailment on TW's right-of-way in McKinley County,  New Mexico forced Operations to blow down the mainline in the east of Thoreau  area.  The accident reduced flow to the California border by 250,000 MMBtu/d  or 25%.  Once the 27 rail cars were removed, a determination was made that  line would need to be hydro-tested to ensure no damage had occurred.   Approximately 2000 feet of pipe was excavated, the coating inspected and/or  replaced, and if test results are good, the line should be back in service  sometime during the weekend of November 3.  While the pipe is being recoated,  the line segment will only operate at 80% of maximum pressure.  TW costs and  revenue losses are being tracked to enable us to recoup damages from  Burlington and/or Enron business interruption insurance.  Sempra Trading - The loss of gas supply from TW's east end enabled us to sell  a max rate IT agreement for 100,000 MMBtu/d to Sempra during this outage.   Duke also moved 40,000 MMBtu/d of alternate volume west at max rates.  Transport Options Tariff - The deadline to file protests on TW's Transport  Options Program was Monday October 30.  Twenty-two parties filed  interventions, of which only three were protests: PG&E, SoCal/Sempra, and  Dynegy.  We expect FERC to schedule a technical conference sometime in the  next 30 days.

All the work is paying off.  Market spreads between production basins and the California border shot up  this week then contracted by Thursday as weather fears and storage shortages  across the US pushed prices up and down.  We successfully negotiated the  following record-setting deals on TW:   PG&E Trading - 30,000 MMBtu IT for 11/15 @ $0.90/MMBtu  PG&E Trading - 30,000 MMBtu IT for 11/16 @ $.075/MMBtu  Sempra             -  10,000 MMBtu LFT for December 1-31 @ $1.00/MMBtu  Transport Options - Our recent FERC filing is on the Commission's docket for  next Tuesday November 21.  We expect the Commission to order a technical  conference maybe before the end of the year.  NGPL - Producers behind Marathon's Indian Basin plant are trying to move  additional volume to TW via the recently reactivated NGPL Winkler  interconnect.  NGPL is evaluating cost options to add compression; this would  also help us sell the point as a firm receipt point and extract more value.

"Below are some notes taken while conversing with several TW customers on the  various reasons prices have risen so dramatically out West.  El Paso line 1103 is still out of service from the August 2000 explosion.   The remaining 2 lines are still operating at reduced flow levels taking  200-300,000/d capacity off the market.  Storage levels in California were low to begin with.  With several coal and  nuclear generation plants off-line (unplanned outages), the gas-burning  generators have been running all out.  Northwest Pipeline has instituted several OFO's this month requiring shippers  not to overpull the pipeline.  Penalty gas was selling for $22.00/MMBtu.  Beginning in November, SoCal Gas instituted its 5-day balancing requirement.   This was not an unplanned event in the marketplace, however, it seems several  entities were caught short early in the month and still haven't caught up.  LDC's east of California have experienced some dramatic weather but not  severe.  They have been impacted more by firm demand to California knocking  off IT and Alternate Firm supply destined for points east of California.   SouthWest Gas has several alternate supply contracts with these LDC's and is  collecting 150% of the market price from these LDC's by using SWG's full  requirements contract on El Paso.  In addition, we now believe SoCal Gas is playing some storage games with the  interstate pipes.  SoCal lowered their window on us for tomorrow to 580,000  down from 750,000 due to ""lower projected gas demand"".  Sempra, Reliant,  Dynegy, and Texaco are calling foul.  The thought is SoCal demand may be  falling but instead of taking excess gas to replenish storage, SoCal is  preventing higher-priced gas from reaching storage.",sharris1@enron.com,kevin.hyatt@enron.com,California Gas Prices - Market Intelligence,2000-11-30 05:54:00-08:00,sent

"Transport Options - In response to our recent FERC filing, a technical  conference has been scheduled in Washington D.C. for January 9, 2001.    Fuel Hedge - With gas prices running at record highs, we hedged 5,000 MMBtu/d  of fuel for calendar 2002 at $4.50, then unwound it the following day as the  market dipped allowing us to book a small gain in excess of $100,000.  We  expect prices to jump again next week with the oncoming cold snap and we'll  likely reset the hedge at higher numbers.  PNM - TW's response to PNM's request for transport proposal went out this  week.  They are paying max rates on an East to East contract and indicated to  us they feel the rates are not currently supported by the market.; TW however  disagrees.  Our response to them leaves the current rate structure in place  but has two additional tiers of volumetric incentive pricing.  As their  volume increases, their rates go down.  In addition, we added a seasonal IT  rate to the proposal that helps them meet any swing gas demand requirements.  Albuquerque Lateral - ENA is meeting with IPP plant owners in the Albuquerque  region who would like to see alternative sources of gas supply besides the  local utility.  If the operators expand the plant from a peaking unit to a  combined-cycle unit, there is potentially enough load to justify a new  delivery lateral off TW's mainline.  Part of the deal structure may include a  volume incentive rate as throughput increases in the lateral.  Next step for  TW is to build a rate matrix under several different operating scenarios.   Responses are due to ENA by Friday 12/15.  Black Mesa Project - We continue to evaluate the potential of converting the  Black Mesa coal slurry line owned by Northern Border into gas service.  The  big advantage for TW is it will increase our capacity to bring San Juan gas  to the California border but there is also a positive environmental play for  Black Mesa and coal slurry along with Mohave and coal pollution affecting the  Grand Canyon.  This whole project is contingent on several factors, not the  least of which is working with Mohave Generating Station majority owner AES  (70%) to convert the plant to gas and working with the Navajo who could lose  a large export market for their coal.  ENA has agreed to approach AES on this  project in the near future once their negotiations on the Las Vegas power  plant are complete.

The sour line would be first be cleaned and tested  for MAOP.  Potential plant connects to this line include the Coyanosa plant  (currently owned by Koch) and Western's Gomez plants.  Potential incremental  plant supplies would be 100-150 MMcf/d of supplies.  Scenario 1:  If Transwestern is willing to be completely at risk for the $2  MM required for the sour line conversion and compression tie-in costs, this  options currently exists and we could move forward.  These costs do not  include the individual plant connections, which could easily be  $400,000-500,000 each.   This would be a relatively high-risk decision.  Scenario 2:  If Transwestern wants shipper contracts to support this project  in part, or in full, the following significant issues need to be considered:     -   Possible ownership changes of the Koch Coyanosa plant to Richardson  Products Company.  There is a moderate to high probability that Richardson  Products Company will purchase the Coyanosa plant, currently owned by Koch.   It is in close proximity to their MiVida system which they purchased last  year and have recently indicated an interest to interconnect with  Transwestern at the Lone Star, Ward location (cost estimates were complete  this week).  Koch has confirmed this rumor of potential acquisition.    Currently Koch has 100 MMcf/d of its own equity gas at the plant, but if the  rumor of the sale of the plant is correct, I may be dealing directly with  Richardson Products rather than Koch.   Another factor to be considered with  this scenario is that if Richardson Products company owns and operates the  Coyanosa plant, they will already have made some strategic decisions about  where their 100 MMcf/d of equity gas will go.   It is possible that through  their MiVida system, Transwestern could have access to this plant gas at  another locational interconnect with Transwestern without having to spend a  penny for the line conversion and connection to the Coyanosa Plant.    Bottom  line is, if Richardson Products does acquire this plant, we needs to take a  step back and look at other scenarios which may be cheaper for accessing this  plant's gas.  - Western Gas Resources contract participation issues:  Western Gas Resources  will eventually have two plants that could be tied into the converted sour  line:  1) Western's existing Gomez plant, and, 2) the newly to-be-acquired  plant sold to them by NNG.   The sale of NNG's Gomez to Mitchell line and the  NNG Gomez plant to Western Gas Resources must occur first.  Western will not  focus its business attention to the possible connection of either Gomez plant  to Transwestern's south-end line prior to this event.  They will eventually  prepare a Declaratory Order to make the newly acquired plant and pipeline  facilities from NNG non-jurisdictional.   NNG & Western have signed the Sale  Agreement and the transfer of funds is expected 1st quarter of 2001 subject  to due-diligence result.  NNG is currently preparing the abandonment filing  for these assets and Western is in the process of their field due-diligence.   Environmental issues (some contamination) relative to the asset sale have  arisen and must be corrected prior to transfer of assets.   All of these  issues may take a good part of 2001 to be resolved.  To Do's:  Monday (when I assume my beautiful, song-bird voice will return), I  plan to discuss the interconnect costs of tying in Richardson's 20"" MiVida  line to Transwestern at the Lone Star Ward location.   We received  Richardson's request for this estimate a couple of weeks ago and the estimate  is about $320,000 (for facilities) plus $100,000 (tax gross-up)*.   In my  conversation, I will try to get Brad Brigham to indicate the timing or  validity of Richardson's possible purchase of this Koch plant.  Once a new  facts can be obtained, it will make the decision making and risk evaluation  process of implementing the Gomez to Puckett tie-in project easier to  understand and take a position on.

When they could not  make the delivery rate, we began allocating their volume; this resulted in  delivery cuts to PNM who then canvassed the market to look for alternate  supply.  Late Tuesday morning PNM called asking about Park N Ride capability  on TW.  We negotiated a $.45 rate for 20,000 MMBtu for one day ($9,000).   Because the rate was above max, we had to file the deal with FERC.  This was  exacerbated by the fact that because of the customer's request for service,  we had to ask FERC for a waiver on the ""one day prior notice"" requirement.  FERC California Pricing - FERC staff members continue to call for help in  understanding transport and commodity prices for gas at the Cal border.  News  to us was the fact that FERC has access to EnronOnline but did not understand  how to use it.  They are also getting a subscription to Gas Daily.  Capacity West - On Thursday 12/21 we did a one day posting for an additional  10,000 MMBtu/d of LFT capacity for January from San Juan to Cal Border.  The  current January spread to Needles is $5.40 net of fuel.  SouthWest Gas - We met with SWG management last week to discuss the service  being provided by TW at their new interconnect.  So far everything is working  well, however, SWG is attempting to maximize their flexibility under the OBA  agreement and their ability to take swing gas from TW.  Our response has been  we will continue to help them when we can within operational limits but we  cannot jeopardize the rest of the TW west system.  SWG indicated they would  like more information regarding our mainline expansion project; they recently  purchased 85,000 MMBtu/d of capacity on the Kern River system.  Pogo Producing - Pogo would like to flow gas to TW's West Texas lateral by  February 1.  They estimate volume of 20,000 MMBtu/d and have no qualm on the  approximately $400,000 interconnect cost.  This is a new well near the  recently connected EOG well.   ",bullets@enron.com,kevin.hyatt@enron.com,TW Bullets 12/22,2000-12-21 02:59:00-08:00,sent

Some of the more notable accomplishments include: a) 100% plus increase in EBIT from 1999 actuals to 2000 forecast; b) significant rationalization of the balance sheet including the sale of t= he=20 (i) Wind River/Powder River gathering assets, (ii) East Coast Power=20 generating assets, (iii) HPL and (iv) five of the six Eastern Peakers; c) ENA is the leading energy merchant by a factor of two; d) physical electricity volume grew by 34% YTD 1999 to YTD 2000 forecast; e) natural gas volumes grew by 82% YTD 1999 to YTD 2000 forecast; f) 500% growth in daily transactions from November 1999 to November 2000 du= e=20 to the highly successful Enron OnLine distribution channel; and g) ENA reaching its 25% ROCE target.  These are truly outstanding accomplishments and our expectations for growth= =20 and opportunity in Enron North America for 2001 are consistent with that=20 success.  In order to reach these goals, we felt it necessary to re-align a= =20 number of our organizations. A number of these changes are completed.  The= =20 goals of such re-alignment include: a) increase overall productivity with the goal to ensure that every employe= e=20 is in a position to contribute regardless of skill set; b) increase overall market coverage, deal flow and information generation= =20 with the goal to increase bid/offer income, increase the velocity of deal= =20 flow, improve customer coverage and promote quality information transfer to= =20 our trading organization; c) increase deal quality and earnings quality with the goal to (i) allocate= =20 our resources towards the best transactions and (ii) significantly increase= =20 our =01&mid-market=018 originated transactions in our portfolio; d) promote real time decision making and a closer tie between our trading a= nd=20 origination (mid-market and structured) organizations in order to better=20 align those functions to reduce the amount of un-productive internal focus; e) increase the overall velocity of the capital being utilized consistent= =20 with our goal of a 25% plus return on capital employed; and f) identify and recognize a host of new leaders in the organization that ar= e=20 critical to meeting our goals next year.  With these objectives in mind, patterned after the successful business mode= ls=20 in Calgary and Portland, effective immediately the following changes are=20 being implemented: a) East Power =01) a single East Power Team incorporating trading, mid-mark= et=20 and origination will be formed under the co-leadership of Kevin Presto and= =20 Janet Dietrich who will report to the Enron Americas - Office of the Chairm= an=20 (EA OOC).

"Pogo Producing - Pogo executed their interconnect and operating agreement  with TW for the new well they anticipate flowing in early February.  We also  received a  payment for incidental expenses necessary to bring the well into  TW's system; expected volume is 30,000 MMBtu/d into the West Texas lateral.  Capacity Marketing - We have created 4 packages of transportation capacity  with terms of 1 to 2 years that we are offering for sale in 2002 and 2003.   Our desire is to price the space based on spreads between gas indices in San  Juan, Permian, and Cal Border.  Our objective is to close these deals by  early next week.  In addition, we have been working with EnronOnline to establish a consistent  capacity offering of most likely east-end space on their trading platform.   Automated contracting procedures have been established.  Legal is working on  the point descriptions and Credit has the potential customer list to set up  trading limits and approvals.  We should be trading on the system before  month end.  San Juan Pigging - The pigging project using methanol to clean the lateral  began this week.  We should know sometime the week of 1/16 if the work had  the desired effect.  FERC Options Filing - Part of the week was spent strategizing with legal and  regulatory affairs on various scenarios that will likely come up in the FERC  technical conference scheduled for next Tuesday, January 9th.  As owners of  electric generation in California, we have requested both Calpine and Duke  attend the conference in support of TW.  Tri-State G&T - Tri-State is the generation and transmission electric  co-operative that serves the Gallup compressor station.  Enron Compressor  Services executed the confidentiality agreement that enabled TW to get access  to system load information on Tri-State's web site.  Next we will need to  build a computer program that monitors the site and automatically notifies  gas control when a likely electrical peak will be reached on Tri-State's  system.  If TW is able to turn down the Gallup compressor, based on  transportation demand, we may be able to avoid some of the peaking electrical  charges.

"We met with Rick Dietz and the Contract Admin group today regarding contract  admin processes for ""regular"" TW deals and the upcoming EnronOnline deals.  For the regular deals:  Primary Contract Admin person is Michelle Cormier, backup by Dennis Lee. Michelle Lokay will essentially take over the admin duties previously handled  by Christine Stokes including generating discount letters and inputting rates  in the system.  Backup will be handled by TK Lohman, Kevin Hyatt, and Craig  Buehler. The contract log and previous ""firm book report"" will be replaced by the  automated ""Transactional Report"" from the contract system. We will also look at establishing a ""general"" mailbox to which customers can  send contract change requests.  This way multiple team members can access the  box and handle the requests.   For On-line Deals  Michelle Lokay is the primary contact working with Michelle Cormier.   Counter-parties will not receive a paper contract but will be get a  confirming email. Credit will be have already been approved as part of the online process. Michelle Lokay will print the screen once a deal has been lifted and route  that to Contract Admin for input to the system. M.

"Transport Options - On January 9 FERC held a technical conference on TW's  Transport Options filing.  Along with FERC staff, there were approximately 20  intervenors present.  Although several of the parties' questions were  intended to clarify the filing, others used the forum to attack collateral  issues such as the affiliate marketing rule, pipeline capacity hoarding and  the market power of Enron Online.  Going forward, TW is due to file pro-forma  tariff sheets to include several clarifying items by Jan. 26, with parties'  comments due on Feb. 13 and reply comments due on Feb. 23.  Capacity Marketing - Dynegy purchased several packages of firm transport from  Blanco to Needles.  One package was 13,500 MMBtu/d for December 2001.  The  other was 21,500 MMBtu/d for November 1 - December 31, 2002.  We will file  negotiated rate letters with FERC for the index pricing.  Agave Energy Co. - Met with Agave this week to discuss potential Atoka  lateral expansion projects and other efforts to bring more producer gas to  TW's West Texas lateral.  Several opportunities were identified and we have  scheduled a follow up meeting for February 7th.  In addition, NGPL called to  set up a meeting next week to look at bringing more gas to us on a firm basis  in Eddy County; there may be some overlapping volume with Agave here.",bullets@enron.com,kevin.hyatt@enron.com,TW Bullets 1/12,2001-01-11 08:10:00-08:00,sent
"Capacity Marketing - TW completed two new long-term Index-to-Index  transportation contracts this week.  Dynegy executed 35,000 MMBtu/d for  calendar year 2003 from San Juan to the California Border and Calpine signed  up for 14,000 MMBtu/d under similar terms.  In addition, Dynegy executed two  short term Index-to-Index contracts; one month, 13,500 MMBtu/d for November  2001, and 21,500 MMBtu/d for November - December 2002.   Both short term  deals are from San Juan to California.  Hedges have been established on all  the contracts to minimize TW's price exposure to the market indexes.  In addition, BP/Amoco purchased two packages of space at max rates on the  Ignacio to Blanco route.  They purchased 55,000 MMBtu/d for calendar 2002 and  20,000 MMBtu/d for 2003.   With the exception of a small package of Permian  to Cal. border in November 2001, all available firm transportation flowing  west has now been soldout on TW through the end of 2003.  Exxon/NALCO Enerflow -  Attended the Exxon presentation to operations this  week on the proposed project to inject a drag reducing agent into several  segments along TW's system.  Potential benefits include increasing our  westward volume capacity by 5%, enhanced compressor efficiencies, and  increased corrosion protection.  However, we are still waiting on the final  results of the NNG Cunningham test segment.  Due to contamination issues on  the mainline, we will likely begin by coating the 96 miles of San Juan  lateral pipe sometime before the second quarter.  TransColorado - TC is evaluating outsourcing its entire back office  operations (legal, regulatory, accounting, etc.) plus its marketing  requirements to a third party provider.  ETS has prepared a draft  qualification statement to be submitted by January 24.  TransColorado hopes  to complete the transaction by late February.  Project McKinley  (Cal Border Peak Shaving) - Attended the marketing /  operations meeting in Long Beach this week to discuss the potential of  injecting natural gas liquids into TW's system to increase the Btu content of  gas going into California.  This project has numerous logistic details to be  worked not the least of which is where to site the injection point either  upstream or downstream of Needles.  Other issues include railroad siding, NGL  storage tanks, and possible contamination of downstream facilities.  A  follow-up meeting is planned for the end of January.  Enron OnLine - TW marketing representatives attended Enron OnLine Training  this week as we prepare to roll out capacity deals on the east end of TW's  system.  The plan is to begin selling by February 1 three to five packages  per day of 5,000 - 10,000 MMBtu/d.  As market demand picks up, we will expand  the offerings.    El Paso Field Services - the new interconnect with EPFS in Eddy County, NM is  behind schedule.  We had previously committed to have TW's facilities  finished by January 1, 2001.  On January 18, EPFS notified us that TW has  quite a bit of work left to do before gas can flow.  (Among other things, the  ROW has not yet been secured from the BLM in order for the electric poles to  be installed).",bullets@enron.com,kevin.hyatt@enron.com,TW Bullets 1/19,2001-01-19 01:59:00-08:00,sent

"Capacity Marketing - SEMPRA renegotiated a firm contract for April-October  2001.

Sempra has also negotiated a true Daily Firm contract for the month of  February 2001.  They purchased an additional 15,000 MMBtu/d to Needles made  available by the higher window at SoCal and higher operating pressures on  TW.   The volume will be index-priced daily based on volume transported.   Assuming all the volume flows, expected revenue could be in excess of  $2,000,000.

The Marathon Indian Basin gas plant is expanding on NGPL and shippers are  looking to move more volume to premium western versus depressed Chicago  markets.  NGPL believes there is 50,000 MMBtu/d trapped behind the plant due  to capacity constraints.  Ideally, they would like to move 100,000 MMBtu/d to  TW.

"Phil--  Enron is currently evaluating the possibility of installing an NGL peaking facility with appurtenant storage and rail facilities near Needles, California.  Ideally, the plant would inject / vaporize normal butane at the rate of 18,750 gallons per hour into a high pressure natural gas transmission system.  Current gas pipeline specs are as follows:  Operating pressure - 850 - 1000 psig, worst case 750, normal range 800-900  Gas Volume - 650,000 - 750,000 MMBtu/day    Expected normal butane (GPA spec) requirement - 450,000 gallons/day (18,750 gal/ per hour)   My questions are:  1) Is anyone currently using butanes for peaking service and if so, where?  2)  Do we need to blend with air (how much) or can we inject straight normal butane?  3)  At what line pressure point do the butanes re-liquefy further downstream of the injection point as the pipeline pressure falls?  4)  Is this peaking plant configuration feasible and if so, at what price (ball park here, don't go way out of your way)?  (If it's not, what would your suggestion be for a design).  I will fax you the normal butane specs as soon as I get them (please email back your fax number).  As always, we're on a pretty tight time frame.  After you've had a chance to review the above, I'd like to get together and discuss this with you.  I can meet you in Ohio if it fits your schedule better, just let me know.  Thanks for the help and I look forward to talking with you soon.

"Capacity Marketing - We negotiated an extension of the 400,000 MMBtu/d  east-to-east contract with Aquila / USGT this week plus improved the  economics of their existing contract.  The extension, beginning November  2001, has a reservation rate of $.025/MMBtu with a 30% sharing of the Permian  to Cal Border index spreads on all alternate westward flow.  As for their  existing contract, we negotiated a $.15/MMBtu rate effective February 15 -  October 31, 2001 on the alternate west flow, an improvement of $.11/MMBtu.    In addition, we negotiated a similar east deal with alternate west flow with  Astra Power LLC.  Their reservation rate is $.0325/MMBtu on a volume of  50,000/d for a term of March 2001 through March 2003.    With the execution of these two deals plus the anticipated closing of the  Public Service of New Mexico contract, this will effectively sell out the  east end of the TW system through at least 2002.  San Juan Flow Conditioner - The decision was made this week to postpone till  March the application of the Exxon/Nalco flow conditioner in the San Juan  lateral.  Had we proceeded with the application in February (a tariff month),  the minimum lost revenue impact for one day could have been $300,000.  SouthWest Gas - We received the fully executed OBA contract from SouthWest  Gas this week.

Reliant is flowing alternate out of path from San  Juan to the border and scheduling 5,000 to 12,000 MMBtu/d.

"Capacity Marketing - We negotiated an extension of the 400,000 MMBtu/d east-to-east contract with Aquila / USGT this week plus improved the economics of their existing contract.  The extension, beginning November 2001, has a reservation rate of $.025/MMBtu with a 30% sharing of the Permian to Cal Border index spreads on all alternate westward flow.  As for their existing contract, we negotiated a $.15/MMBtu rate effective February 15 - October 31, 2001 on the alternate west flow, an improvement of $.11/MMBtu.    In addition, we negotiated a similar east deal with alternate west flow with Astra Power LLC.  Their reservation rate is $.0325/MMBtu on a volume of 50,000/d for a term of March 2001 through March 2003.    With the execution of these two deals plus the anticipated closing of the Public Service of New Mexico contract, this will effectively sell out the east end of the TW system through at least 2002.  San Juan Flow Conditioner - The decision was made this week to postpone till March the application of the Exxon/Nalco flow conditioner in the San Juan lateral.  Had we proceeded with the application in February (a tariff month), the minimum lost revenue impact for one day could have been $300,000.  SouthWest Gas - We received the fully executed OBA contract from SouthWest Gas this week.

"Capacity Marketing - TW sold 35,000 MMBtu/d of firm transport to Sempra  Energy Trading at a negotiated rate of $0.50/MMBtu plus fuel for the two year  period beginning January 1, 2004.  The path is from Blanco to SoCal Needles;  contract value is $12.8MM.  In addition, Sempra waived its right to utilize  its call option for 21,500 MMBtu/d of capacity at $0.30/MMBtu during this  two-year period.  TW also sold 14,000 MMBtu/d of firm transport to Calpine for two years  beginning Jan. 1, 2004 at a floating rate based on the difference between the  California border and the San Juan Blanco indices.  The primary delivery  point is Calpine's newly constructed power plant on the Topock lateral.  The  floating price can currently be hedged to yield a gross margin of  $0.80/MMBtu, with a contract value (net of fuel) of $6.1MM.  BP/Amoco was one of several interested parties last week as TW marketed the  remaining large blocks of our East capacity.  BP has come back to TW with an  offer, based on available space, of $0.02/MMBtu for demand plus a sharing  mechanism for alternate deliveries west.  The proposed term is for 2001 April  - October.  We are working with Facility Planning to determine the available  space.  Gas Inventory - TW continued to experience high line pressure and pack out  west this week.  This necessitated an additional sale of line pack gas of  15,000 MMBtu for a gross revenue of $277,500.  El Paso Natural Gas Co. - Bids were due Monday (2/12) for the 1.2 Bcf/d of  west capacity on El Paso.  They marketed the space in 5 blocks of various  capacities;  minimum bid was 100% of the max California reservation rate for  a minimum term of 1 month.

"TW Negotiated Rate Filings - We were notified by FERC this week that TW's recent negotiated rate filings are on the docket for Wednesday March 28.  The possible outcomes include 1) approval of the negotiated rates or; 2) reduction of the rate down to TW's max rate and refunding the difference back to the shippers or; 3) acceptance of the rates but directives to modify all future negotiations to some form of more standardarized rate calculation.  Conoco -  The shipper missed its ROFR notification last month.  They hold 20,000 MMBtu/d from Thoreau to Needles expiring 04/2002 and 20,000 from Blanco to Thoreau expiring 03/2003.  We will post the capacity for five business days (ending Monday 03/26 at 5 pm) because the replacing contract is for term greater than 1 year.  If other shippers come in with a request during the 5 posting days, capacity will need to be prorated or allocated in a lottery.  If requests come in after the 5 posting days, the space is sold first come first served for max rate bidders.  Mavrix is requesting this capacity through 12/2004.  Alberta Energy Co. - AEC is Canada's largest gas producer and North America's largest independent gas storage operator.  Included in their storage facilities is Wild Goose Storage near Gridley, California (north of Sacramento).  They are currently connected to PG&E and are marketing an open season to expand the facility from 14 bcf to 38 bcf (in service date of April 1, 2004).  They are asking for minimum 5 year term commitments at rack rates awarded by net present value.  This may be an opportunity for Transwestern to indirectly have an option on storage or for Mavrix to directly lease storage.  SoCal Gas Needles Expansion - TW met with SoCal Gas in Los Angeles on 3/22.  In this meeting, SoCal Gas said it would be presenting a plan to management on Monday 3/26 to expand its Line 235 capacity at Needles by 50 MMcf/d.  The $2mm expansion requires the installation of a 1,000 hp electric compressor.  SoCal Gas intends only to notify the CPUC of its planned construction but will not seek CPUC approval to include the cost of these new facilities in rates.  SoCal Gas believes it can have the new facilities in place within 8 - 10 months.  TW will continue discussions with SoCal Gas to identify additional projects to further increase take-away capacity beyond the 50 MMcf/d contemplated in this first expansion.  Agave - TW and Agave field personnel are evaluating some valve and compressor reconfigurations that may allow Agave to move up to 60,000 MMBtu/d across the 10"" LEC/Atoka line.  The changes would enable high pressure field gas to avoid being compressed into the low pressure side of the Atoka lateral.  We are also considering installing a tap and meter to move some Agave gas into the Duke/Crawford system.  Duke would then re-deliver the volume into the high pressure side of the West Texas lateral.  Because the gas would be moving off TW, into Duke, then back into TW, it could subject Duke to regulation under the Natural Gas Act.  Duke is aware of the risk and is evaluating their strategy.  Lone Star - LS Pipeline representatives were in the office this week in conjunction with Gas Fair.  We described the Red Rock project and the aptitude for producers on Lone Star to reach California markets.  Lone Star realizes they need to add compression to their system to access the West Texas lateral on a consistent basis.  They are evaluating their options, including selling some ""under-utilized"" pipe in west Texas.  They are sending us an updated system map to see if any asset synergies exist.  US Gypsum - USG' s energy management representatives from the Chicago headquarters came to Houston to discuss the Red Rock expansion.  The have four plants in California that consume a combined 11,000 MMBtu/d off SoCal and PG&E.  Their current transport contract with PGT expires April 2002 and they are evaluating options to source supplies from areas other than Canada.  They would like a portion of Red Rock but require Needles delivery capacity (which is fully subscribed through 2005).  They are very frustrated by the lack of response from their SoCal reps in coming up with a feasible solution to expanding Needles in the short term.  We told them we would keep them updated as our expansion conversations with SoCal progress.  Enron Energy Services - EES Corporate Development is evaluating opportunities to install small (50 Mw or less) distributed generation units in the western region.  They have identified TW's Kingman compressor station site as a strong candidate because of its proximity to gas supply, an APS electric substation, and abundance of available land.  Their goal is to have something operating before summer 2001.  They are reviewing environmental permitting requirements to see if fast-tracking the installation is feasible.  TXU - We negotiated an extension of the transport contract for 20,000 MMBtu/d for a 2 year term beginning April 1, 2002.  The path is Bloomfield to Needles.  This contract was done in lieu of the shipper exercising its ROFR option under the existing agreement.  Transwestern's average deliveries to California were 1120 MMBtu/d (103%), with San Juan lateral throughput at 861 MMBtu/d and Rio Puerco at 7 MMBtu/d.  Total East deliveries averaged 350 MMBtu/d.

"Capacity Marketing PG&E Trading has re-aligned several transport contracts including a pre-arranged capacity release deal with Texaco for June - October.  PG&E sold 50,000 MMBtu/d of Topock delivery capacity at index formula-based rates.  However, Texaco is not utilizing Topock; they have chosen to re-deliver the gas to Citizens, east of the Cal border.    Short Term April Capacity Deals      El Paso Field Services - EPFS would like to deliver another 50,000 MMBtu/d to TW's West Texas lateral as early as May 1 through the new Eddy County, NM interconnect.  TW informed them that at this point we will decline to share in the cost of expanding the interconnect.   Agave - Agave and Duke have for regulatory reasons chosen not take gas off the LEC 10"" and redeliver to the Crawford lateral.  Their counsel informs them they stand the risk of making their gathering systems FERC jurisdictional pipelines.   NGPL - Met with business development reps this week to discuss the various interconnects between NGPL and TW's east system.  NGPL is conducting an open season on expanding the takeaway capacity on their line from the Marathon Indian Basin plant.  NGPL needs to add 6,000 hp of mainline compression plus a 1,000 hp booster compressor to access TW's high pressure system.  This additional horsepower would only bring an estimated 42,000 MMBtu/d incremental to TW.  Based on the cost, NGPL has proposed TW paying for the booster compressor.  Facility Planning is evaluating this cost plus possibly sizing a larger booster to see if we can gain additional throughput capability on the West Texas lateral.   FERC Negotiated Rate Filings - In our negotiated rate proceeding, the Commission issued a Section 5 ""show cause"" order.  TW must, within 10 days of the order, show cause why its actions in offering the negotiated rate contracts (Reliant, Richardson, BP, Sempra, Astra) were not in contravention of Commission policy.  TW must explain the availability of firm capacity on TW's system, and how it has the firm capacity to move gas under the transactions under investigation, yet provide recourse service without interruption.     Red Rock Expansion - The project documentation was filed at FERC on Thursday March 29.   Caithness - The project developers for the Big Sandy generation project near Wickieup, AZ informed us this week they would like a budget quality cost estimate for tying the power plant exclusively to TW.  Caithness will install the approximately 40 miles of line to reach TW.  They projected in-service date for the plant is August 2003.  Phase 1 will consume 80,000 MMBtu/d, phase 2 will take an incremental 40,000 MMBtu/d.

"As I mentioned the other day, one of the possible ways to receive high volume of gas from our customers is to design and construct new compression facilities adjacent to TW mainline around Atoka-2 in Eddy County area. Ofcousre the 550 mmcf/d capacity figure between WT-1 and Station-9 stays the same. This scenario would only ties the gas to the existing mainline capacity.  Based on our meetings, I thought if TW pursues this we might get some of this gas supply to our system and I have made the following assumptions :  n BP has 50 mmcf/d at 750 psig n Agave   75 mmcf/d at 750 psig      n NGPL   42 mmcf/d at 750 psig     Total             167 mmcf/d.    To tie 167 mmcf/d to TW-36"" at 950 psig pressure would require 4,000 hp recip units. The estimated ""A"" release cost (+-30%) is approximately $6,000,000.  If you have any questions/ comments please call.

" Capacity Marketing - Conoco was awarded the 20,000 MMBtu/d of capacity from San Juan to Needles at max rates for five years and one month beginning 3/1/02.  Demand charges for the term total $14mm.    Despite the ongoing system maintenance that began this week, gas control has steadily been able to increase TW's west flow from the projected 800,000 MMBtu/d to 900,000 by week's end.  We have also been able to schedule IT deliveries at max rates from Topock to Needles.  This slight increase will help us make up for the greater decrease in volume due to DOT mandated reduced operating pressures when the safety dig-outs commence in early May.  For the period May 8-12, our projected flow of 800,000 MMBtu/d to the border will be reduced to 705,000.  Atoka Lateral Test - We have been working with Agave Petroleum to reconfigure some gas flow as it moves through the Atoka 3 station on the lateral.  Agave is moving approximately 15,000 MMBtu/d of its high pressure gas onto the LEC 10"" lateral from the Atoka low pressure line.  The TW Artesia Team moved one A3 compressor from Atoka to the LEC line.  The first test day was Thursday 4/5; the test will run for one week.  If the test works to everyone's satisfaction, we will need to install an additional H2s monitor at A3.  The net benefit to TW of the test will likely be minimal but may allow Agave to better utilize its compression and plant resources around the Atoka system.  ONEOK Westar - We have been working with ONEOK to enable them to make the existing Ward County, TX delivery point a high-volume bi-directional point.  They have installed approximately 1500' of pipe from their Red River system over to the south end (below WT-2) of TW's West Texas lateral.  The ultrasonic meter will be capable of flowing 200,000 MMBtu/d into TW's high pressure line.  ONEOK expects to flow on average 80,000 MMBtu/d.  This volume, by displacement, should free up some WT-2 and WT-1 compressor capacity for gas flowing to Texas intrastate lines; in-service date is expected to be June 1, 2001.","lindy.donoho@enron.com, jeffery.fawcett@enron.com,   lorraine.lindberg@enron.com, tk.lohman@enron.com,   michelle.lokay@enron.com, audrey.robertson@enron.com",kevin.hyatt@enron.com,TW Bullets 4/6,2001-04-06 09:07:35-07:00,sent
"Sheila--  Currently, the TW Market Team manually calculates the various prices associated with our negotiated rate deals at the end of every month.  Once the calculation is complete, the price is input into the billing system so customer invoices can be generated.  I have 3-4 people spending a full day every month end performing this rate calc for their deals (no two are exactly alike).  These calculations are all based on various published market indices.  As you evaluate the development and installation of the new contract billing system, is there a way we can automate this rate process?  Were it not for the manual labor process, the TW team would likely do more index-based negotitations.

Stan is an officer and can execute documents for EPC.  Steve wanted the Party defined to be broad so that it could encompass several possible entities on Enron's part.   2.

I am working with the following assumptions:  1. The 120 monthly spreadsheets will be maintained and updated to the EBB every hour between 6:00 am and 6:00 pm.  This is consistent with the historical updating since mid 1998, and I will continue to do this until the new CAS process is tested and released for your group to use(Best guess  2 more month-end nom cycles).  2. The new CAS process will update the EBB with the same data as the spreadsheets.  We need to determine if we will include all receipt & delivery points, and if we will include a partial group/path list as we currently post.  Currently the spreadsheet contains only those points and/or groups that we thought our shippers might be interested in using monthly.  3. The Gas Control Allocation and Facility Planning unsubscribed modules are adopting new standard group names,  I will let you review what those will be prior to any changes to production.   4. The ROFR flag is now in the new CAS and will reduce the unsubscribe numbers past the contract expiration date.  This will be effective after CAS is released to you.  Currently the 120 monthly spreadsheets tract subscribe FT to the contract expiration date, no reservations past the expiration date.

Ideally, I would like no more than 3, Steve and Drew however agreed to no less than 5 years.  Their only qualification was if you concurred.  I understand we have made certain posting representations in our FERC Capacity Options filing.  Drew and Steve thought it better to wait until after the Options approval from FERC before we made any changes to the EBB.  Are you OK with this?  From a business perspective, posting TW capacity for 10 years reduces our negotiating leverage on long term contracts.  From an administrative perspective, trying to maintain 120 monthly spreadsheets with correct capacity figures is a nightmare.  Maintaining this level of detail only increases the risk of making mistakes.

Ideally, the unit would vaporize and inject GPA spec Nc4 (normal butane) at the rate of 18,750 gallons per hour.  At 102,913 btu/gal, this equals 1.93 Billion Btu/hr.  The vapor would be injected into a natural gas pipeline with a nominal operating pressure of 750 - 1000 psig (normal range is 800-900).

"As you know, 33,000/d at La Maquina does not equate to 33,000/d at either the Arkansas Loop Plant or the new receipt point with Red Cedar in the La Plata station yard.   (According to Ron, it's a matter of physics!!)  Anyway, Red Cedar will be using the new receipt point on an alternate basis, so to the extent gas is not coming in at La Maquina, they'll be able to flow some amount of incremental through the new point.  If we sell 33,000/d primary firm out of La Maquina, it would back off the alternate gas at the new Red Cedar point.  My opinion is that if we can find a party to buy the 33,000/d from La Maquina - go ahead and do it because we've never made a representation to Red Cedar that the new point capacity is associated with any line capacity.

It has been my understanding that the capacity of the facilities is 500,000/d through the La Plata ""A"" compressor south to Blanco and that the capacity of the facilities south of the La Plata ""A"" compressor is an additional 200,000/d south to Blanco, for a total of 700,000/d.  Northwest Pipeline holds 23,811/d of southflow capacity through the La Plata ""A"" compressor.  That is all of their southflow capacity.  So, TW has 476,000/d of capacity from La Plata ""A"" and the whole 200,000/d of southflow capacity south of La Plata ""A"" to sell.  I show that we have 476,000/d subscribed through the La Plata ""A"" compressor south.  I show that we have 172,200/d subscribed south of La Plata ""A"", leaving 27,800/d unsubscribed south of La Plata ""A"".  I understand that the capacity at the Red Cedar/Arkansas Loop receipt point is fully subscribed at 205,000/d (12,500/d Southern Utes, 125,000 Red Cedar, 13,500/d Texaco, 21,200/d BP Energy & 32,800/d NWPL), but the capacity that's reserved for NWPL at this interconnect is related to NWPL's northflow transmission capacity, so it should not be included in the southflow totals.  Therefore, I would like to confirm that there is 27,800/d of southflow capacity south of La Plata ""A"" that could be sold from a receipt point other than Arkansas Loop.  Basically, the transport would have to come from the WFS/La Maquina receipt point and deliver to either I/B Link or EP/Blanco.  Please let me know if you agree.

"NGI's Daily Gas Price Index  published : May 24, 2001 PG&E NEG Breaks Ground on 1,048 MW Harquahala Plant  After years of planning and regulatory hurdles, PG&E Corp.'s National Energy Group (PG&E NEG) began construction Monday on the Harquahala Generating Plant, a 1,048 MW natural gas-fired generating facility located approximately 70 miles west of Phoenix in the town of Tonopah, AZ (see Daily GPI, Aug. 17, 2000 <d20000817j.html>).  The $500 million project is expected to help ease the burden of the surrounding electricity markets, which are currently very tight. The company said it envisions selling power in the fast-growing, three-state market of Arizona, southern Nevada and Southern California. The plant is scheduled to be in full commercial operation by June 2003.  ""Today's (Monday) groundbreaking is an important milestone for electricity consumers in Arizona and the Southwest, as well as for the National Energy Group,"" said Tom Boren, CEO of PG&E NEG. ""Clean, efficient, affordable, electricity. That's what the Harquahala Generating Project is all about.""  The Shaw Group reported Wednesday that it has entered an agreement to provide the engineering, procurement and construction services for the project. Shaw said it will assume engineering duties immediately.  The gas supply for the plant will come from the El Paso Natural Gas sSystem, which is located near its site. The plant is also located next to major transmission lines serving the three-state area and northern Mexico. With a fuel requirement averaging about 180 MMcf/d, PG&E NEG will have firm transportation agreements and then play the markets in the West and Southeast, according to Jim Tramuto, a Houston-based manager for NEG.

"CA Settlement Stalls; Generator Construction on Track  As work moved forward Tuesday on two new power sources to come on later this summer, the outlook in the immediate two months darkened with no apparent comprehensive solutions emerging from the state legislature.  ""The fact that there are several competing proposals in the legislature kind of indicates [the governor's] Memorandum of Understanding has some trouble,"" said Jerry Jordan, head of the Sacramento-based California Municipal Utilities Association. ""Certainly if there is a [Southern California] Edison settlement we would hope to get paid out of that (as would the merchant generators).""  AES received all of its final permits last week, and began construction this week on re-powering two generation units totaling 450 MW at its Huntington Beach facility in Orange County about 40 miles south of Los Angeles. Initial power supplies from the re-started and re-built units will begin in August, said Aaron Thomas, AES's San Francisco-based manager for California operations.  Separately, Calpine Corp. on Tuesday announced that initial construction of 135 MW of peaking generation capacity will begin this week next to the company's existing Gilroy power plant in Gilroy, CA, an agriculture town not far from Calpine's San Jose headquarters. Upon completion of a two-phase build-out, the Gilroy Energy Center will be a 270 MW, natural gas-fired, simple cycle peaking generation facility. Commercial operation of phase one is scheduled for September 2001. An additional three 45 MW gas turbine generators will be installed in phase two, with full build out estimated for May 2002.  No one thinks current efforts, not matter how accelerated, will avoid rolling blackouts, however.  ""There obviously is concern among some munis that they have adequate supplies, but are still asked to participate in rolling blackouts anyway (the 1 million-customers Sacramento Municipal Utility District is in that category),"" said Jordan. ""To the extent there is the possibility of bringing on emergency generators, that is being done. Everyone has done pretty much what they can do.""  Jordan noted that the public sector generators, like their private sector counterparts, need air quality restrictions waived temporarily so units that carry restricted hours of operations can be turned loose during summer peak demands to help avoid blackouts.

If the pressure at Conoco reduces, it will create higher differential pressure at monument and that will reduce the capacity.

"Pipes on the Way for Constrained Rockies  As natural gas prices in the Rocky Mountain region over the last few months have fallen much further than other areas of the country due primarily to transportation constraints, the question becomes, why is the region currently experiencing a frenzy of exploration and production activity, when pricing signals point toward restraint? The answer, according to Raymond James & Associates analyst Wayne Andrews, is that new pipeline infrastructure is on its way to the region, and in a big hurry.  ""While Henry Hub gas prices have fallen from the mid $7/Mcf range to below $4/Mcf, Rocky Mountain gas prices have fallen from the mid $7/Mcf range to below $3/Mcf,"" Andrews said in the company's Stat of the Week report. ""This basis pricing differential between the Rockies and other areas has widened considerably as pipeline limitations have created a gas supply chain bottleneck.""  Andrews explained that the Rockies/Henry Hub differential has historically widened during the summer months, and narrowed during the winter when gas demand is at its peak. The fluctuation occurs because midstream companies can charge higher transportation rates when demand is low, forcing producers to realize a discount price for their gas.  ""Nevertheless, prior to 2000, increasing export capacity from the Rockies and modest volume increases kept the differential below $0.50/MMBtu,"" Andrews said. ""More recently, however, the boom in drilling activity during the past several years has caused production out of the region to outpace additions to infrastructure, effectively amplifying the differential problem. In fact, the Rockies/Henry Hub differential peaked near $1.30/MMBtu last summer before receding during the winter months, and has already reached that level again this summer. Consequently, some Rocky Mountain natural gas producers may not be able to meet expectations for earnings and cash flow because they are realizing lower prices.""  But studies have shown that the area is large and filled with precious long-life reserves, and once adequate pipeline infrastructure is in place, the exploration and production (E&P) companies in the region will be able to produce at capacity.  Andrews suggested that while many analysts normally take the conservative route regarding natural gas price assumptions, many this year did not take into account such a wide basis differential. In the near term, the analyst advises production companies in the area to hedge production and/or the basis differential when the pricing environment is favorable. He also said that locking in firm transportation capacity agreements to erase seasonal peaks and valleys in the differential can also help.  As for the long run, Andrews said that midstream pipeline expansion in the Rockies will ""ultimately eliminate the differential problem."" According to the Independent Petroleum Association of Mountain States (IPAMS), more than nine new and expansion projects totaling over 3 Bcf of incremental capacity are currently expected to be complete before November 2003, with four additional projects with unreleased in-service dates.  To accommodate the growing Powder River Basin production, Fort Union Gas Gathering LLC announced plans in January for a 200 MMcf/d expansion of capacity on its system (see Daily GPI, Jan. 18 <d20010118h.html>). IPAMS said the company now expects to be finished with the expansion ahead of schedule this month, as opposed to the company's previous expectations of the fourth quarter.  Also jumping into the fray, Duke Energy Field Services (DEFS) and BP America Inc. reported on Monday that they have entered into a 12-year agreement to expand gathering and processing infrastructure and services to accommodate BP's Greater Green River Basin drilling program in Wamsutter, WY (see related story this issue).  ""Overall, this expanded infrastructure will enable new gas supplies to be delivered to consumers within the Midwest market areas,"" said Steve Blossom, asset manager for BP.  ""The bottom line is that widening Rockies/Henry Hub basis differentials will likely prove to be a short-term, seasonal issue and not have a material longer-term effect on activity or company valuations in the Rockies,"" Andrews said. ""That being said, the potential for those basis differentials to remain large or even widen further, increases the possibility of some producers falling short of their earnings estimates in the near term.""  Andrews added that many E&P companies in the region have already taken measures to protect against the differential and will not be affected greatly. The hustle and bustle of recent E&P and pipeline activity in the region are evidence of the vastness and potential of the Rocky Mountain play, he said.

"Gas Pipeline Rush is Alive, Well in NW  Nature's severe downturn in the amounts of hydroelectricity in the western region over the past 12 months has been a giant wake-up call for natural gas as new gas-fired power plants are spurring an unprecedented rush to build added interstate pipeline transmission into Washington and Oregon.  PG&E Gas Transmission Northwest (GTN) announced it has new binding precedent agreements with 25-year terms totaling about 250 MMcf/d based on a open season concluded in mid-June in the Pacific Northwest. This is for an expansion in 2003 and is in addition to earlier announced expansions for next year, which are currently pending before the FERC and will add about 200 MMcf/d of firm capacity to the system. New power generation makes up almost all the growth to be served by the expansions.  Williams' Northwest Pipeline last week announced yet another expansion--its fourth in less than a year--in the state of Washington, all involving proposed new electric generating plants and collectively representing hundreds of millions of new daily capacity into a state that used little other than wood and hydroelectric energy until the last few decades of the 20th Century. Besides the recently announced $200 million, 276-MMcf/d, 26-mile Evergreen Pipeline expansion to fuel several new power plants in western Washington, Northwest already is pushing ahead with plans for three other pipeline expansions:  Nine miles of 20-inch diameter pipeline, the Everett Delta Project, will be completed in August 2002, bringing 86 MMcf/d of new gas supplies to fuel a power plant under construction by an affiliate of Florida Power and Light, FPL Energy, in the fastest growing area in the state, Snohomish County, on former industrial property owned by Weyerhaeuser.  A 50-mile expansion, the Grays Harbor Lateral, in the area around the state capital of Olympia, WA, to serve a 600 MW combined-cycle power plant (Satsop Development Park) Duke Energy intends to build. The $75 million project is schedule to be completed in November 2002.  The Georgia Strait Project in far northwest Washington will extend underwater to Vancouver Island in British Columbia. It includes 84 miles of new pipeline to two new power plants slated to be built. The $159 million expansion and joint effort between Northwest and BC Hydro is scheduled to be completed in the fall of 2003; federal approvals on both sides of the Canadian border were applied for last spring.  Underscoring this effort by Williams and the similar proposed expansions by PG&E GTN is the well-recognized fact that the Pacific Northwest historically relied too heavily on one energy source--hydro. Officials at the Northwest Power Planning Council and within the individual energy companies headquartered in the region are now hooked on new gas-fired generation as are all of the western states.  ""The overwhelming reason for high power prices is scarcity, borne largely from sharply higher-than-expected demand growth, and the savage downturn in hydroelectricity supplies,"" wrote energy consultants Samuel A. Van Vactor and Frederick Pickel in a technical article on deregulation published earlier this year.

"New Generation Starts Up in CA; Others Drop Out  Although California officials are gaining optimism from new electric generation plants finally coming on line today and in the next two weeks, there are signs that the electron rush of the past few years may peter out if the current uncertainties surrounding the state's electricity markets continue to fester.  The state's chief cheerleader for new supply, conservation and federally ordered suppliers refunds, Gov. Gray Davis today takes his pom-poms to the oil fields southwest of Bakersfield to flip the switch on a new 320-MW, simple-cycle cogeneration plant developed by Edison Mission Energy and Texaco Power and Gasification, whose supplies are totally dedicated to the state at about six cents/kwh, with a $4.40/MMBtu natural gas price over 10 years.  But current generators and other developers of new plants are expressing caution toward continued unabated development of new plants, given pending state legislation that would impose windfall taxes and/or possible confiscation of private-sector generating plants, in addition to a law on the books that makes criminal acts of market manipulation by generators, if proven to be the case in court. (Most legislative proposals exempt new plants, however.)  Atlanta-based Mirant Corp. said earlier this month that it is holding up its plans for new plants, even though it recently won state approval to build a new 530 MW plant in the East San Francisco Bay suburbs, and it has proposed building a new plant in electron-starved San Francisco. Mirant placed the plans on hold until it feels the state political and economic climate has stabilized.  And a Reliant Energy executive told stock market analysts Tuesday he would not be surprised to see delays and even cancellations of power projects throughout the West because of uncertain prices and the strange political environment (see related story, this issue).  Another large generating company operating in California recently told NGI, any further projects it had been considering in California were ""off the screen,"" and had been ""pushed back to a study mode, at best."" The generator, caught up in the current round of lawsuits, declined to be named.  Although he admits some generators ""want to wait a little bit,"" Steve Larson, executive director of the California Energy Commission, which okays all major power plants, said, ""generally speaking, the rush is still on. There are still people applying, so as far as we can tell. People are still coming to us with their energy projects and want them sited as quickly as possible."" (About 7,800 MW are under construction, the energy commission said.)  ""We don't have a shortage of people wanting to build plants here in the state,"" said one of Davis's spokespeople, Roger Salazar.  In the public sector, the nation's largest municipal utility, Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, has delayed plans on beginning construction of a 500 MW repowering project at an existing 325 MW power plant in the San Fernando Valley section of the city, because of problems with the local electrical workers' union that complained about the winning bidder being a nonunion contractor. LADWP said it could be delayed up to six months to allow the project to be re-bid.  In the meantime, although not necessarily counted in the governor's highly promoted new power plants, LADWP is moving ahead with five new 50 MW peaking plants at existing plant sites, as part of a $1.5 billion integrated resource plan for the next five years.  The governor stressed the accelerated time frame in which the Sunrise plant began construction on Dec. 7, 2000, making it operational in a record-setting 6.5 months. The construction force worked 18-hour days, six days a week, and the plant was brought on 32 days ahead of schedule. (Edison's MOU with the governor included financial incentives to get the plant on line early.)  That makes it eligible for more than $1 million in construction incentive payments under the Governor's Executive Order (D-32). By the summer of 2003, it will have an output of 585 MW. As a single-cycle plant, the authority to operate runs for only 18 months, or this and next year's summers. It will be expanded and brought on as a combined-cycle, cogeneration and baseload unit for a longer time period.  The plant is the first major one to start up since Davis took office. Two more are coming on line in the next two weeks. More than 4,000 MW of new power is expected to be online by the end of summer, in what the governor and his people are dubbing as ""a California success story.""

"Report Pessimistic on Planned Power Plants  Less than half of the electric power plants now in development in the United States are likely to be completed, according to an analysis of electricity and natural gas supply and demand by an energy analyst with the Williams Capital Group LP, a New York-based investment bank.  While those new facilities that actually do get built will ease tight power markets and alleviate political pressures to control prices in the near term, high gas prices and electricity price volatility are likely to continue, according to Christopher Ellinghaus, an energy analyst with Williams Capital. Only if new coal-fired or nuclear power plants come on line in significant numbers, are shortages likely to be abated, the analysis noted. But Ellinghaus pointed out that bringing new coal-fired or nuclear power plants on line at any significant level cannot happen until 2005.  Although independent power producers and other electricity suppliers hope to have 300,000 MW of new generating capacity on line by 2005, it is doubtful that much more than 100,000 MW will be possible over the next three years, Ellinghaus asserted. He attributed the difference to infrastructure constraints, including U.S. energy policy, public attitudes toward new facilities and anemic growth of natural gas supplies, the fuel to be used in over 90% of the proposed plants.  Pointing out that gas supplies have been growing by less than 1% annually despite record drilling activity, Ellinghaus warned that unless unprecedented amounts of new, net gas production emerge over the next three to five years, only a fraction, perhaps 40% to 45%, of the natural gas-fired plants currently being developed will actually be constructed.  Demand for electricity is likely to grow by 3% annually through 2010, Ellinghaus forecasted. That rate reflects the fundamental shift in the U.S. economy that has made electricity-intensive technologies such as computers, telecommunications and the Internet the engines of U.S. economic growth.  To meet this demand and build sufficient reserves to avoid price shocks, U.S. power generators would have to build 330,000 MW of new and replacement capacity by 2010, a 41.7% increase from the 822,000 MW of capacity in 2000. If all the new plants were gas fired, demand for natural gas would grow by between 11 and 15 Tcf, requiring the gas market to grow from 22.4 Tcf to between 33 and 38 Tcf.  The analyst said that in order to meet that demand, natural gas supply would have to increase by 9% annually. Based on production experience over the last decade, it is doubtful that such a level of increased production could be achieved, Ellinghaus said. Most gas exploration and production analysts expect an annual growth rate in the 1% to 3% range.  There will be adequate gas supply to the fuel new plants being built this year and next, when 43,000 MW and 36,000 MW of new generating capacity are expected to come on line, Ellinghaus said. However, in subsequent years there only would be enough gas supply to support 20,000 MW of new plant construction. ""Natural gas remains the principal constraint to completing and operating plants currently in development.""  As a consequence of insufficient gas supplies, power generators would have to build 200,000 MW of generating capacity fueled by coal or uranium to meet long-term demand, Ellinghaus stated. However, because of the lengthy development cycle and public policy concerns, new plants relying on these energy sources will not begin to come on line in sufficient numbers until 2005 or 2006..

"I have reviewed the interconnect (K#7033) and transport agreements (K#20822) with Citizens Utility.  Under the interconnect agreement, Citizens has to be able to take a min. and max pressure of 600-1000 psig from TW.  The good news is as follows:   Citizens has amended their transport volume for the Flagstaff point (poi# 500134) to 2,000/MMBtu/d effective 6/01 - 10/01 and only 5,000/d from 11/01 - 2/07.  This is a significant reduction over what they took thru the point for the winter months Oct '00 thru Mar'01.    What this means to TW/ENA is there appears to be capacity available today thru the Flagstaff lateral that would serve the generation plant being proposed by EES.  So any volume TW delivers for EES, up to the capacity max on the lateral (25,000/d), should not impare deliveries to Citizens.    I have a question for Fac. Planning: does the Flagstaff N.E. POI# 500046 lie on the same lateral?  If it does, then Citizens has 1,990 MMBtu/d for 6/01 - 10/01 and 2,950 MMBtu/d for 11/01 - 2/07 also contracted and we have to keep this in mind as the look at the volume EES may need.

The actual project is to install an additional tap and measuring facilities at the end of the lateral for peak deliveries of 12-15 MMcfd to ENA for power generating.  The problem is that the lateral capacity is about 25-27 MMcfd based upon turbine meter capacity for the Citizens Flagstaff point, but Citizens has about 25 MMcfd scheduled at their three points on the west end.  Their contract allows for them to take full obligations at either point (Kevin is checking on this); however, I don't believe that their flow regulation at the Flagstaff point (two-2"" regulators) can do more than 15 MMcfd (my intuitive guess, needs to be checked or verified).  Pressure - TW may be between 725-775 psig at peak TW mainline flows to Ca., Citizens pressure is reported to be around 365 psig downstream of control valves.     The greatest daily volume (MN 9213) since Jan 2000 was 11942 Mcf on Jan. 18, 2001 (as can be seen in the attached Excel worksheet extracted from MIPS meas. data).  The flow graph on Jan 18, 2001 also obtained from MIPS is shown below:  << File: MN9213_daily_vol.xls >>         Planning Question: if Citizens meter capacity is say 15 MMcfd at some pressure, can we subscribe the remaining lateral capacity to ENA and still maintain pressure and volume obligations to either Citizens or ENA?  What would new pressure conditions look like flowing 30 MMcfd through the lateral?   -----Original Message----- From:  Eric Faucheaux   Sent: Thursday, May 31, 2001 7:43 PM To: Eric Faucheaux Subject: Citizens Flagstaff Interconnect   ---------------------- Forwarded by Eric Faucheaux/ET&S/Enron on 05/31/2001 02:40 PM ---------------------------         From:  David Roensch                           05/16/2001 01:25 PM       To: Eric Faucheaux/ET&S/Enron, Rich Jolly/ET&S/Enron@Enron <mailto:Jolly/ET&S/Enron@Enron> cc:    Subject: Citizens Flagstaff Interconnect  Eric, I'm going to try an provide the info requested this morning.  This will at the very least be a starting point for our discussions.   The following are the details as I understand it: The Citizens Flagstaff Interconnect is one of three Interconnect points with Citizens that gas is nominated to on a daily basis.  One daily nom is made by Citizens that covers all three interconnect points.  The other two interconnect points are Citizens F89A interconnect (In Flagstaff) and the Citizens Kingman TBS interconnect.  (two points in Flagstaff and one in Kingman)  Again, one nomination is made covering Citizens at all three points.  The total nomination is not to exceed 25 mmcfd.  This 25 mmcfd can be split between all three points or taken as a total at any one point.   (I hope that made sense)  So, with that said, as I understand it, we must maintain the ability to provide 25 mmcfd at the Citizens Flagstaff point of delivery.    We have approximately 7 miles of 6"" lateral from Transwesterns 30"" mainline feeding this interconnect.  Once at the metering station we have a 4"" auto adjust turbine meter which is limited on flowing capacity based of inlet pressure to some degree.  (See chart below)  Please see drawing (Flagstaff 6"" Lateral  ICCU-AB-A1-01) for details of meter station yard and piping.  Once the gas flows out of the 4"" turbine meter we discharge into a line heater that Transwestern owns.  Immediately on the discharge side of the line heater, Citizens piping begins.  Citizens has 2 ea., 2"" regulator runs that control pressure into their City mainline.  (Again please refer to the drawing number listed above for detail)    I know that pressure profiles in Section 3 will change after Red Rock so I would not dare to guess what the supply pressure to the 6"" Lateral would be but, System Ops should be able to provide this info on a best/worst case senario both pre and post Red Rock.

(See chart below)  Please see drawing (Flagstaff 6"" Lateral  ICCU-AB-A1-01) for details of meter station yard and piping.  Once the gas flows out of the 4"" turbine meter we discharge into a line heater that Transwestern owns.  Immediatily on the discharge side of the line heater, Citizens piping begins.  Citizens has 2 ea., 2"" regulator runs that control pressure into their City mainline.  (Again please refer to the drawing number listed above for detail)    I know that pressure profiles in Section 3 will change after Red Rock so I would not dare to guess what the supply pressure to the 6"" Lateral would be but, System Ops should be able to provide this info on a best/worst case senario both pre and post Red Rock.  (Assumptions would have to allow for a unit down at Station 2 & 3, I would assume)    Flow Capacity Info for a 4"" Auto Adjust Turbine Meter:  Pressure               Max Flow Rate 600#                                  19,920 mscfd      700#                                  23,540 mscfd 800#                                  27,310 mscfd 900#                                  31,200 mscfd The flowing capacity between the various pressures can be interpolated  I hope this answered some of your questions.  It might be a good idea to have a quick conference call with representatives from Planning, System Ops, Marketing, Engineering and Operations to discuss the details........

"At our meeting Thurs 7/19 with SouthWest Gas, Tom Armstrong informed us that SWG is the property and mineral rights holder for this salt dome north of the TW line near Kingman.  SWG is completing a feasibility and engineering analysis on developing the potential gas storage site.  I indicated that TW / Enron would welcome an opportunity to work with SWG in developing the storage field and Tom was very receptive to the idea.  SWG refers to the project as their Pataya or Red Lake storage field.  The project would be 12 bcf net of pad gas, turn 12x per year, with 300mm/d deliverability.  Phase I of 6 bcf may be operational by late 2003.  Tom and I agreed to stay in touch on the project.

Well I kind of forgot about it for a few weeks and once I got to checking there are some salt domes in the Kingman area.  They are located about 10 miles North of Kingman and word is that El Paso had looked into developing these domes several years ago but never did anything but look.  I'm under the impression that the area is still privately owned but I'm not certain.  Anyhow, just thought we would pass this along and if this is something of interest or if you need more information let us know....  Oh yea, Transwesterns pipeline is just South of Kingman, Az.

"Kevin, I apologize for not getting back to you sooner as I have been out of  touch for the last week.  I read John's message to you and agree with him  that we should develop a formal plan to address how we will generate public  support and address any future environmental concerns before they jump up and  bite us.  As you may know, Flagstaff is one of those areas where there is  much environmental support to keep the area as pristine as possible and there  does exist a number of environmental groups which use this as their agenda to  keep development to a minimum.  I will forward to you a memo from David  Roensch, team advisor in the Flagstaff area, of an article he found providing  the active participation of the environmental groups in the Flagstaff area.   Ive done some cusory inquiries as to land status and have polled the Bureau  of Land Management, State of Arizona,  State Historic Preservation Office and  the Forest Service which is the major landowner between Flagstaff and  Phoenix.  I have not heard back from all of agencies as yet, but will let you  know if there are any glaring environmental concerns or if there  appears to  be trouble on the horizon.   John and I have briefly traded thoughts on this  project and we would  like to take a more proactive approach  ""up front"" with  regard to public participation and input prior to breaking ground.  Its hard  to deal with public issues when construction is underway.   As for the $$$$$ for the environmental studies, you are correct in assuming  that the existing portion of the project from Bloomfield to Flagstaff will  require very little capital, as long as we limit and ensure our construction  activities to the existing right of way.  Proceeding south from Flagstaff to  Phoenix is where the initial expenditures will be the greatest.  Once the  pipeline corridor is identified and staked, surveys will need to be completed  for the following:   threatened and endangered plants and animals, archeology  surveys for bones, artifacts, relics etc, noise surveys should this portion  of the project require installation of horsepower.  The FERC will require an  EIS (environmental impact statement) and environmental report to be  conducted.  These activities include not only the environemntal issues but  also things like socioeconomics, land use soils, geology etc.  Past  consttruction projects has shown that third party involvement with this  greatly expidites the process (John has eluded to this previously).  Due to  the rough terrain and topography of the land south of Station 2 into Phoenix  makes this project extremely hard to give an approximate dollar amount  for  the environmental baseline surveys and permits to be completed as the entire  proposed right of way (140 miles) from station 2 into Phoenix will need to be  walked and surveyed by several people.  I would rather wait until we can  identify on a map the corridor route and send out proposals for each of the  surveys to be performed on the pipeline prior to giving a $$$$ figure.    However, because you need something for a preliminary budget estimate, I  would recommend an amount of $70,000 to 90,000  for the baseline  environmental work and this might be a little light, in the event the surveys  identify something.......please dont hold me too close to this number as it  is a WAG contingent upon a number of variables that are relatively unclear at  this time.  Having the pipeline corridor identified on a map will greatly  assist in the environmental budgeting for this project.

John     -----Original Message----- From:  Campbell, Larry   Sent: Wednesday, August 01, 2001 6:11 PM To: Shafer, John; Rice, Randy; Hyatt, Kevin Subject: Phone Conversation with TNC  Today I spoke with Jean Calhoun of the Arizona Chapter of The Nature Conservancy about the proposed Sundevil Pipeline Construction Project. She was very cordial and appreciative concerning Transwestern's proactive efforts to contact not only her office but all federal and state agencies  which may have jurisdictional lands impacted by the project.  Although the proposed route of the pipeline corridor has not been firmly established, she did  offer some general, yet valuable information concerning the geographic area which exists south of Flagstaff into roughly northern Phoenix.    The area south of Flagstaff into Phoenix crosses of three major ecological regions identified by the TNC with major biological diversity of plants and animals.  The TNC has completed published studies on two of the regions.  The TNC has requested that should this project be apporved, these publications be used to assist in the environmental studies which will need to be completed prior to construction and approval by FERC.  To the south and east of Flagstaff is a sensitive portfolio consisting of the Verde River which is of ecologic interest due to the abundance of endangered fish and bird species which live in and around the area of the River.   This river could be impacted by the pipeline due to its meandering in a southwesterly direction across Arizona.    I have contacted other state and federal governmental agencies, in addition to the TNC, and all parties have expressed difficulity in assessing the environmental impact of a project of this magnitude without knowing the pipeline corridor route.  Part of this concern is due to the extensive and unique biological diversity of Arizona.  I think we will have a better handle on how we address the environmental concerns and opportunities when this piece of the puzzle is completed and also how much more specific and helpful the agencies assistance will be when identified areas are known.",kevin.hyatt@enron.com,john.shafer@enron.com,FW: Phone Conversation with TNC,2001-08-02 05:37:07-07:00,received

To the south and east of Flagstaff is a sensitive portfolio consisting of the Verde River which is of ecologic interest due to the abundance of endangered fish and bird species which live in and around the area of the River.

"Kevin,   I'm sorry, Kevin.  I didn't realize the report was that long!  Here is a little synopsis.  I hope this helps you.  I haven't had time to read the report yet, but if I see a better summary come out, I'll send it your way.  Lorna  CEC Blames Overtaxed In-State Gas System for High Prices  Confirming what the state's energy crisis made abundantly clear months ago, the California Energy Commission (CEC) staff last week released its final draft report on the state's natural gas infrastructure, concluding that it is constrained and has caused higher-than-average wholesale gas prices, particularly in the southern half of the state. But the report did not totally rule out market manipulation as a culprit.  It concludes that a combination of infrastructure shortcomings and possible market manipulation has to the higher natural gas prices in California. ""Market participants may have manipulated prices even higher than justified by existing infrastructure bottlenecks, but it is the inability of gas customers to rely on competition between gas suppliers that contributed to higher prices in California,"" the report stated.  Among a half dozen recommended steps the state can take to help bolster initiatives already under way by utilities and merchant energy suppliers, said the CEC report, which will go to the five-member commission for approval Aug. 22. It stressed encouraging the development of more ""independent"" gas storage facilities, and taking steps to more fully ""optimize"" storage, including an increase in its use by large end-users.  As a backdrop to the study's conclusions, the CEC report noted that both upgrades of in-state infrastructure and interstate pipeline capacity are needed to meet ""growing demand in California and throughout the West."" If the current proposed interstate pipeline expansions don't come online as scheduled, the CEC report said other state actions would be necessary, although it did not spell out what those might be.  For the future, the report said that the CEC will track more closely storage levels and natural gas prices because they are ""key indicators"" of how extensive problems might be at any given time in the state's natural gas infrastructure.  The other steps recommended for action are: 1) encouraging more in-state natural gas production (the state legislature already has proposed a new law to provide incentives); 2) setting new ""design criteria and reliability standards"" for the state's gas system to reflect what the CEC calls ""the changing nature of natural gas demand, especially for electric generators;"" 3) establishing integrated planning of the state's pipeline and storage facilities; and 4) developing a ""natural gas curtailment scheme"" emphasizing efficiency and optimizing gas use in times of shortages.  The 111-page report, ""Natural Gas Infrastructure Issues,"" prepared by the CEC Electricity and Natural Gas Committee for final adoption of the five-member politically appointed commission, assessed the state gas industry from the perspective of supply, pipeline capacity (both inter- and intrastate) and storage, with the added elements of the recent historically severe drought in the Pacific Northwest and the in-state pipeline constraints at the California-Arizona border.  As part of the proposed implementation, the report recommends that the CEC work more closely with the California Public Utilities Commission to develop a new curtailment policy that is ""fair and at the same time promotes the efficient use of natural gas"" during shortage periods. It also proposes that the CEC this fall conduct a workshop to determine ways to have non-core, large energy-intensive customers better optimize their use of natural gas storage.      -----Original Message----- From:  Hyatt, Kevin   Sent: Tuesday, August 14, 2001 7:52 AM To: Brennan, Lorna Subject: RE: Draft Copy of CEC's Final Report on California Infrastructure  can i have the Reader's Digest condensed version please!!!!!!   -----Original Message----- From:  Brennan, Lorna   Sent: Monday, August 13, 2001 10:54 AM To: Chavez, Gabriel; Dowd, Stephen; Gadd, Eric; Hyatt, Kevin; Millar, John; Ratner, Michael; Taylor, Gina; Hass, Glen; Loeffler, Michael; Stanton, Lon; Wilson, Rob; Harris, Steven; Donoho, Lindy; Goradia, Pallavi; Lindberg, Lorraine; Lohman, TK; Lokay, Michelle; Moore, Jan; Watson, Kimberly; Huber, Lee; Pryor, Tony Subject: Draft Copy of CEC's Final Report on California Infrastructure   << File: cec.infrastructure.pdf >> ",kevin.hyatt@enron.com,lorna.brennan@enron.com,RE: Draft Copy of CEC's Final Report on California Infrastructure,2001-08-14 08:54:10-07:00,received

Let me know if you have questions. kh   As part of the study, a 30-acre site, located on a thick, naturally occurring salt deposit, is being evaluated to determine if it has the potential to support an underground cavern storage facility. The property is located in an industrial area near the intersection of Dysart Road and Glendale Avenue, near Luke Air Force Base.

It delighted this old teacher's heart and mind.  Twenty of the upperclassmen who pride themselves on doing the ""upper level"" activities of the project were here over the weekend for a campfire/hotdog roast and planning session.  They are fired up to get started.  Their youth and enthusiasm has kept me young all these years. Many of the kids shown in the Bugle pictures were here in my backyard.  They will be delighted to hear that the article touched your heart.     Yes, I lead a busy life, but I am never too busy to talk to people like you who have the same devotion to conservation and youth.  I look forward to speaking with you via the phone.  Students report on Tuesday for their first day.  Tomorrow I will be getting my indoor classroom ready but I shall be home by 4:00 PM EST. Are you located in Texas also?  This may be coincidental since I am about to embark upon a Texas campaign, sending information to 300 Project Wild trained high school teachers.      I promise to call soon.  Thank you for energizing this old teacher and sending her back to school on a positive note.  The upperclassmen do some pretty sophisticated writing and speaking.  One of the girls who went to the Dakotas with me in August, just answered a man's email today concerning the donation of an item.  For the fun of it, I am attaching the answer she sent out just today FYI along with a letter the group sent to other habitat schools before school dismissed.

Even though we had received a verbal approval formt he Navajo Nation that endangered species would not be a concern by the Nation, the EPA felt otherwise.  This means that they wont give us a permit until we do a survey for plants and animals.  Because ENSR was on the list of contractors approved by the Navajo Nation, they were given the opportunity.  As you know, I have been working with Scott Patti on this and we have worked it through.  All that is left is to get the ENSR renewal permit application approved by the Nation and ENSR is off and running to do the surveys.

For simplicity, we will add this as a new task for the Red Rock Expansion project.  The FT.

With El Paso having done 5 studies on different allocation scenarios, shippers requested four more, showing seasonalization impacts and the difference between CD and Full Requirements shipper Coincidental and Non Coincidental Peaks.    Though there were some FR vs. CD shippers discussions, they did not reflect the battle we see going on in the two complaints filed this summer by  the TX, NM and AZ FR shippers and Aera Energy (CD shippers).  There was also no mention of converting FR shippers to CD service.  The primary issue here ended up being procedural, with the decision still up in the air if this should be set for hearing or a merits decision from the Commission (or settlement, though that seems very likely -- merits decision is the most likely case).  Also never mentioned were the CD and FR complainants proposals that El Paso dedicate currently proposed expansions to existing shippers or requiring mainline system expansion for existing service (RP01-484 and 486).

"Overall, the results from Thursday's open season on our Sun Devil Project were very favorable (see below).  Contract terms ranged from two to sixteen years.  San Juan  84% subscribed at targeted transport rate Phoenix  97% subscribed at nearly targeted transport rate Cal Border 77% subscribed at 61% of targeted transport rate  We obviously have some work to do on the California piece but overall, the market interest supports our efforts to move forward with all due haste to the next level.  With that in mind, we'll begin working on the next steps below:  Next steps-   - Finalize Level A hydraulic study (9/7) - Prepare Level B estimate  (9/30)  - Schedule on-site ROW reviews (9/10) - Schedule briefing session with FERC in September - Issue press release on open season results (week of 9/3) - Mobilize commercial teams to firm up contracts (week of 9/3)  For now, please regard this memo as highly confidential.  We appreciate everyone's support and hard effort thus far--  now the real fun begins!  Look for more info to follow soon and regularly scheduled project update meetings to begin in September.

"   -----Original Message----- From:  Taylor, Gina   Sent: Wednesday, September 05, 2001 11:17 AM To: Hyatt, Kevin Subject: Additional Questions from Eric  Hi Kevin!  Eric thought we might get the questions below.  Can you provide answers to these questions?  Thanks or your help, Gina  PS - the capitol of Arizona is Phoenix.  QUESTIONS THAT NEED TO BE ANSWERED  How much new gas is being produced in the Rocky Mountain and San Juan gas supply basins? [Hyatt, Kevin]   San Juan Basin production peaked in 1999 at 4.3 Bcf/day and is expected to decline by 2.4% year for the next 10 years.  However, over the same 10 year forcast period, 6500 new wells are scheduled to start producing.  In addition, current Rockies production is expected to average 250 MMcf/d in 2001 growing to 570 MMcfd by 2009.     What gas-fired electric generation projects will be served by Sun Devil? [Hyatt, Kevin]    There are a number of power plants currently being developed in the Phoenix area.  We are evaluating which projects make the most economic sense to serve.   Kinder Morgan and El Paso are proposing pipeline projects to serve Arizona and California.  Why do we need another pipeline? [Hyatt, Kevin]    The KM Sonoran project proposes to serve the California border and eventually the San Francisco area, not southwest Arizona.  El Paso's proposed expansion is not expected to be enough to meet the growing demands of the Southwest including Phoenix, Southern California, and Baja California.  Gas prices are collapsing in the Permian basin.  How competitive are new gas supplies from the Rocky Mountain and San Juan basins? [Hyatt, Kevin]  Gas production in the Rockies and San Juan basin has been on the increase but there has not been enough pipeline capacity to move the gas to market.  This capacity bottleneck has had the effect of depressing prices in the San Juan basin.  Historically, San Juan prices have been a few pennies to as much as fifty-cents below Permian gas prices.  As recently as Jan. 2001, San Juan gas was nearly $2.00 less than Permian.   Why are so many power projects being developed in Phoenix?  How necessary is all this new power generation capacity?  What markets will it serve? [Hyatt, Kevin]  The Southwest U.S., inlcuding the Phoenix area, has experienced an increase in population and therefore energy demand.  Over the last several years, power reserve margins (the available power supply in excess of demand) have been shrinking from a high of 22% to less than 8%.  This reserve margin decline, coupled with a drought-induced decrease in available hydro power supplies from the Northwest, have created a need for new electric power plant generation capacity.  Because of the availability of high voltage transmission capacity from the Palo Verde area, it was natural for developers to site plants near these lines to move power into Phoenix and Southern California.   The economy is not nearly as strong now as it was last year.  Why do we need more pipelines and power plants? [Hyatt, Kevin]   Existing pipe capacity to the Phoenix and So. California areas is not sufficient to meet EXISTING demands, let alone the demand created by the new power plants under construction.  There are more power plants planned for the Phoenix area, but with the economy slowing down, those projects may be somewhat delayed.

"Kevin: Thanks for the information and 5000 feet of halite if it is one uniform bed is certainly similar to Gulf Coast salt domal opportunities.   If you decide to move forward with this effort, issues of water can be evaluated based upon Arizona rules and regulations for fresh water use and salt water disposal.  I have spoken with Morgan regarding a  Fall 2001 Meeting, 7-10 October, 2001, Albuquerque, NM, USA of the Solution Mining Research Institute which might have some information regarding developing salt storage in Arizona.

[Hyatt, Kevin]   Bedded  What is the thickness of the salt layer at the development site? [Hyatt, Kevin]   over 5000 feet  What is the chemistry of the salt, i.e. is the salt halite, gypsum/anhydrite calcium sulfate), sodium sulfate [Hyatt, Kevin]   95 -99% halite  Has any drilling been done at the site, coring, rock mechanics evaluation? [Hyatt, Kevin]     Are any geological reports available for the site? [Hyatt, Kevin]    Test wells have been drilled.  I'm not confident I can get report copies.  What restrictions exist (rules and regulations) regarding storage development in Arizona? [Hyatt, Kevin]   water & water disposal  What is the availability for water to solution mine the a cavern? [Hyatt, Kevin]   water is available, disposal of the brine solution will be an issue   Just a few thoughts, I apologize that I cannot be with you on Wed. and if I need to travel to Arizona to meet with technical staff, I certainly can make arrangements after my trip to Wichita next week.  Regards,  Maurice  [Hyatt, Kevin]   The storage cavern will be built in 3 phases, 3.3 Bcf working gas per phase, 330mmcfd withdrawal, 165mmcfd injection 30 day / 12 turn capability.  Compression will likely be 8-9000 hp per cavern (electric units).  Leaching time will be 1-2 years.  Brine disposal test scheduled for November.  There is a Morton Salt  plant adjacent to the cavern site.  Morton will likely take some of the brine, but not enough (too much salt will depress the maket price for the commodity).  First cavern to be available late 2004 / early 2005, 2nd cavern late 2006.",kevin.hyatt@enron.com,maurice.gilbert@enron.com,RE: Salt storage,2001-09-26 08:03:45-07:00,received

Toby, if it was a posting, it would have gone up in late December or the first few days of January.  Please verify whether we did any open season posting advertising that space (which included Dec. 01 space and calendar '02 and '03 space).

This list includes all power plants including coal, natural gas,  wind, etc that we have identified.  Would you mind having someone checking  off which of the power plants most likely would be directly served by  Transwestern Pipeline?   If you have other affliates that will serve some of the power plants or if  you are aware of other plants, please include them.   This is a part of the integrated planning we are under taking.  Our  NARG model and the Electricty Analysis Office's models are now tuned  to include power plants that maybe directly served by interstate power  lines.  We provide forecasted natual gas prices by pipeline designation to  the Electricty Analysis Office.     By having generation plants grouped by pipeline the EAO can provide back to  us natural gas demand for electricity generation by intertate pipeline.      By this process the EAO gets gas prices for modeling the electricity market  and we get gas generation demand to model natual gas pipelines.   We are not in a rush to get this information so take your time.  If  you need a date to shoot for then mid Novemeber, say Friday the 16th.   Thanks for your help.

The conference will be held in St. Louis, MO March 19-21, 2002.  Website is www.electricpowerexpo.com/ep2002/cfp.html  One of our proposed speaking topics is ""Changing Gas Quality Specs""  and the impact to today's turbines which are supposedly much more sensitive to gas specs than older generation units.  Another potential topic is ""Pressure Reliability"" dealing with the impact to gen units with varying fuel pressures.  I'm looking for an expert at GE Power Systems who would be willing to give a 15-30 minute presentation on either of these topics on the afternoon of March 20, 2002.  They would be speaking with 2-3 other presenters and then participate in a Q&A session afterward.    If you have someone who may be interested, please let me know and I can send them a formal invitation or just have them call me direct.  Thanks for the help!

"Sun Devil:  Sonoran Pipeline -  Calls to various levels of Kinder-Morgan management have elicited no response.  Sources indicate their project is still moving forward but is having ""marketing issues"". ROW - A large diameter water line that serves Palo Verde runs from West Phoenix to the nuclear plant.  One thought was to use the ROW to install the gas line and reach the new generation plants in the area.   However, AZ Public Service indicated that the water line is constantly being replaced due to corrosion and repair work may interfere with any other line in the same easement. Cost estimate - Current fully-loaded cost estimate (including interest, overheads, ROW, etc.) is $680mm based on a reduced scale project of 500,000 MMBtu/d capacity to Phoenix.  Various deal structures are being analyzed to present several pricing options to the market.  Likely minimum term will be 20 years based on the cost. Marketing -  Duke - Met 10/25.  They have a need for 40,000 - 120,000 MMBtu/d and would likely take capacity on Sun Devil at a ""competitive"" rate.  Preparing rate  offerings for their review 11/5.  AZ Public Service -  Met 10/24.  They are very interested in the project and would commit today if they were given an economic out based on unfavorable  outcome of El Paso / FERC full requirements proceeding.  Working to develop an MOU with out clause if they fund the early EIS work.  Sempra - No response yet.  Southwest Gas - Still interested in the project but unwilling to commit due to El Paso full requirements issue.  They are however interested in doing a JV to  utilize their Phoenix lateral to enable the Sun Devil project to tie into the El Paso south system.  Panda Energy - Meeting set in Dallas on 11/2.  Panda has the capability to be the anchor shipper for the project.  Preparing detailed supply basin study for management review. El Paso / FERC  - waiting on response from Regulatory to review recently submitted comments.  Shippers indicate some decision likely from FERC as early as Dec 2001 or as late as March 2002.   Copper Eagle Gas Storage - Open season for the proposed West Phoenix storage facility began 10/15 and was to close 10/24 but was extended an additional week for market participants.","eric.gadd@enron.com, susan.wadle@enron.com",kevin.hyatt@enron.com,weekly update 10/26,2001-10-26 14:39:58-07:00,sent

I figure we'll get to Parker, Colorado the afternoon of Sun 11/11 and unload the truck on Monday.    If you're still looking to rack up some flight miles, would you want to meet me in Parker (just south of Denver) and fly me back to Houston.

Rocky had DeJuan's ankle under his armpit and then Rocky rolled over after they were both lying on the ground (can you say Dirty)?  The OU quarterbacks took a beating too!

" Kevin, we have not yet had the opportunity to meet as I have not been able to make it to the Committee meetings as Carrie had set-up. Taking a look at the Agenda, I can probably help with items 5 or 6 and would be happy to develop and deliver a presentation or would ensure that a senior representative from Enbridge would do that. My natural tendency (with my current position in Northern Pipeline Development) would be towards the Agenda Item No. 5 (New Supply  Sources), but I probably could find a good resource within Enbridge to present some views and thinking on the Infrastructure De-bottlenecking item.

For those of you I haven't met personnally, my name is Kevin Hyatt.  I am currently chairing the Natural Gas Infrastructure subcommittee for the Electric Power Conference 2002 to be held in March. You are receiving this email because you have previously expressed an interest in serving on the committee.  Attached below is the current subcommittee track agenda with the 4 sessions and each session's speaking topics.  The track and topics were developed over the last 3 months with various inputs from committee members and the Trade Fair Group staff.  Our current challenge is finding speakers for items 1, 6, and 15 (highlighted in red).  If you move your cursor over the topic, the comment box will appear outlining in a little better detail what info we are trying to present for the conference attendees.  I am working on lining up several speakers but as of yet have only confirmed one from Calpine.  What I need each of you to do is review the agenda, think about who you may know who would be a good speaker for the topic, then call them to see if they are interested.  Speeches should last no more than 30 minutes with a Q&A period afterward.  If possible, please email or call me with your results by Friday 10/26. Interested speakers will receive a formal invitation from the Trade Fair Group confirming their attendance.  Thanks for your help.

"To calculate maximum hourly allowable volumes the daily firm volume (Maximum Daily Quantity, or MDQ) in the contract is multiplied by the hourly per cent.  If the per cent is not shown in the contract, then the tariff rate of 6% is used.  Assuming 1000 MDQ, at 6% is:  1000 * .06 = 60 per hour, or a daily rate of 60 * 24 = 1440  So at any time the customer can flow at a rate of 1440 but cannot exceed 1000 for the day.  An individual delivery point cannot usually drastically affect the mainlines, but they can affect smaller laterals.  Consequently, any lateral for this customer would be designed to deliver 1440 per hour.  Shorthand for the daily rate is .06 * 24 = 1.44.     Multiplying any MDQ by 1.44 gets the daily rate, assuming the max hour is at 6%.",kevin.hyatt@enron.com,buzz.smith@enron.com,Maximum Hourly Flow,2001-11-01 13:47:04-08:00,received

"Kevin--  As we discussed yesterday, Panda Energy International, Inc. and TECO Energy, Inc. (Tampa Electric) have formed a partnership to build, own, and operate a 2300 Mw gas-fired electric generation plant located in Maricopa County, Arizona, southwest of Phoenix.  The partnership may be called ""Panda Gila River L.P.""  Here are some of the details as we know them:  All building/ air permits received, construction has commenced  Financing closed 6/04/01 (oversubscribed by 56%)  $2.2 bn loan ($1.7bn 5 yr. bullet loan and $500mm equity bridge)  Financing led by Citibank and Societe Generale  50% of power output sold under long term contracts, 50% on spot market  What we want to know is:  How did the banks get comfortable on the financing if only 25% of the gas pipeline transport capacity is under contract? (And right now there is only one pipeline capable of serving the plant's needs) How did the banks get comfortable with only 50% of the power output sold under long term contracts?  What happens after the bullet loan comes due-- are the operators taking interest rate risk and hoping to refinance at a lower rate in year 5?  Any information you can provide on the above would be very helpful.  We are scheduled to meet with Panda in Dallas on Tuesday 11/6. thanks for the help.

"   -----Original Message----- From:  Smith, Buzz   Sent: Thursday, November 01, 2001 3:47 PM To: Hyatt, Kevin Cc: Alters, Dennis Subject: Maximum Hourly Flow  To calculate maximum hourly allowable volumes the daily firm volume (Maximum Daily Quantity, or MDQ) in the contract is multiplied by the hourly per cent.  If the per cent is not shown in the contract, then the tariff rate of 6% is used.  Assuming 1000 MDQ, at 6% is:  1000 * .06 = 60 per hour, or a daily rate of 60 * 24 = 1440  So at any time the customer can flow at a rate of 1440 but cannot exceed 1000 for the day.

"Hi Harvey--   As we discussed, I'm chairman of the Natural Gas Infrastructure subcommittee for the Electric Power 2002 conference.  The conference will be held in St. Louis, MO March 19-21, 2002.  Website is www.electricpowerexpo.com/ep2002/cfp.html.  Primary attendees are electric power plant developers, builders, operators, and equipment suppliers.  One of our proposed speaking topics is ""LNG - a new role in North American supply."" A concern among power generators has been the lack of domestic gas supply and pipeline infrastructure to serve growing gas-fired electric generation needs.  The Committee feels LNG can and will play a more a prominent supply role in the near future.  I'm looking for an LNG expert who would be willing to give a 15-30 minute presentation on the morning of March 20, 2002, 10 - 11:30am.  They would be speaking with 2-3 other presenters and then participate in a Q&A session afterward.

"Kevin,  I talked with Larry Black with Southwest Gas Corp. today.  I had called him to inquire about the possibility to getting more market in the Las Vegas area.  He said that they have for quite sometime tried to come up with a way to expand their system to add new customs but could never justify it.  Larry said he would welcome the opportunity to explore a way to expand their system into Las Vegas.  Do you think that there is a way we could compete with Kern River in Las Vega or find a way to take advantage of the capacity Kern River has available from Las Vegas into Kern Mojave Pipeline?    Larry said that he met with you and Lorraine Lindberg about 10 days ago to talk about the Sun Devil Project and he thinks that Steve Harris and Lorraine will be meeting in Las Vegas with SWG in the near future.  If we or they come up with any ideas, maybe it could be discussed then.  Steve",kevin.hyatt@enron.com,v.dickerson@enron.com,SW Pipeline Corp.,2001-11-09 14:15:08-08:00,received
"Kevin,  Steve Harris reported that SW Gas wants to sign up for the remaining 12,400/d of Redrock expansion capacity.  They are talking about 14-15 cents for 10-15 years.  Also, they are interested in capacity expansions to Las Vegas.  This will reduce the Sun Devil capx, which we should include in the economic modeling.    In progressing discussions with anchor shippers, we should consider some additional rate design features- Capx/ROE incentives, eg if we build the project for $911 MM, we earn a nominal return, say 9% while if we come in at <$800 MM, we earn 14-15% Fuel tracker - - - this takes money out of the deal for us but probably makes the pricing more transparent.   -----Original Message----- From:  Hyatt, Kevin   Sent: Thursday, November 08, 2001 5:37 PM To: Centilli, James; Junus, David Cc: Gadd, Eric Subject: SFV Rate Design for Sun Devil Importance: High   James & David --  Can the two of you coordinate a revenue model for Sun Devil that incorporates a Straight - Fixed Variable rate design along the following parameters using 15, 20 and 25 year terms:  San Juan utilization: 85% of 780,000/MMBtu/d Mainline: 85% utilization of 810,000/MMBtu/d Phoenix lateral: 75% utilization of 500,000 MMBtu/d  Also, prepare some ROE sensitivities if the above utilization falls by 10% and rises by 10%.

"   -----Original Message----- From:  Mahoney, Peggy   Sent: Monday, November 19, 2001 10:30 AM To: All EES@ENRON Subject: What Enron Did Right  A great editorial in the Wall Street Journal today.  Manager's Journal: What Enron Did Right By Samuel Bodily and Robert Bruner  11/19/2001 The Wall Street Journal A20 (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)    This is a rough era for American business icons. Subject to the vagaries of age (Jack Welch), product failure (Ford/Firestone tires), competition (Lucent, AT&T), technology (Hewlett-Packard and Compaq), and dot-bomb bubbles (CMGI), managers and their firms remind us that being an icon is risky business. The latest example is Enron, whose fall from grace has resulted in a proposed fire sale to Dynegy.     Once considered one of the country's most innovative companies, Enron became a pariah due to lack of transparency about its deals and the odor of conflicts of interest. The journalistic accounts of Enron's struggles drip with schadenfreude, hinting that its innovations and achievements were all a mirage.    We hold no brief regarding the legal or ethical issues under investigation. We agree that more transparency about potential conflicts of interest is needed. High profitability does not justify breaking the law or ethical norms. But no matter how the current issues resolve themselves or what fresh revelations emerge, Enron has created an enormous legacy of good ideas that have enduring value.      -- Deregulation and market competition. Enron envisioned gas and electric power industries in the U.S. where prices are set in an open market of bidding by customers, and where suppliers can freely choose to enter or exit. Enron was the leader in pioneering this business.     Market competition in energy is now the dominant model in the U.S., and is spreading to Europe, Latin America, and Asia. The winners have been consumers, who have paid lower prices, and investors, who have seen competition force the power suppliers to become much more efficient. The contrary experience of California, the poster child of those who would re-regulate the power industry, is an example of not enough deregulation.      -- Innovation and the ""de-integration"" of power contracts. Under the old regulated model of delivering gas and electricity, customers were offered a one-size-fits-all contract. For many customers, this system was inflexible and inefficient, like telling a small gardener that you can only buy manure by the truckload. Enron pioneered contracts that could be tailored to the exact needs of the customer.     To do this, Enron unbundled the classic power contract into its constituent parts, starting with price and volume, location, time, etc., and offered customers choices on each one. Again, consumers won. Enron's investors did too, because Enron earned the surplus typically reaped by inventors. Arguably, Enron is the embodiment of what economist Joseph Schumpeter called the ""process of Creative Destruction."" But creative destroyers are not necessarily likable, pleasant folks, which may be part of Enron's problem today.      -- Minimization of transaction costs and frictions. Enron extended the logic of de-integration to other industries. An integrated paper company, for instance, owns forests, mills, pulp factories, and paper plants in what amounts to a very big bet that the paper company can run all those disparate activities better than smaller, specialized firms. Enron argued that integrated firms and industries are riddled with inefficiencies stemming from bureaucracy and the captive nature of ""customers"" and ""suppliers."" Enron envisioned creating free markets for components within the integrated chain on the bet that the free-market terms would be better than those of the internal operations. The development of free-market benchmarks for the terms by which divisions of integrated firms do business with each other is very healthy for the economy.      -- Exploiting the optionality in networks. In the old regulated environment, natural gas would be supplied to a customer through a single dedicated pipeline. Enron envisioned a network by which gas could be supplied from a number of possible sources, opening the customer to the benefits of competition, and the supplier to the flexibility of alternative sourcing strategies. Enron benefited from controlling switches on the network, so that they could nimbly route the molecules or electrons from the best source at any moment in time to the best use, and choose when and where to convert molecules to electrons. This policy, picked up by others in the industry, created tremendous value for both customers and suppliers.      -- Rigorous risk assessment. The strategy of tailored contracts could easily have broken the firm in the absence of a clear understanding of the trading risks that the firm assumed, and of very strong internal controls. Enron pioneered risk assessment and control systems that we judge to be among the best anywhere. Particularly with the advent of Enron Online, where Enron made new positions valued at over $4 billion each day, it became essential to have up-to-the-second information on company-wide positions, prices and ability to deliver.     The unexpected bad news from Enron has little to do with trading losses by the firm, but with fears among trading partners about Enron's ability to finance its trading activity. In a world where contracts and trading portfolios are too complex to explain in a sound bite, counterparties look to a thick equity base for assurance. It was the erosion in equity, rather than trading risk, that destroyed the firm.      -- A culture of urgency, innovation and high expectations. Enron's corporate culture was the biggest surprise of all. The Hollywood stereotype of a utility company is bureaucratic, hierarchical, formal, slow, and full of excuses. And the stodgy images of a gas pipeline company -- Enron only 15 years ago -- is even duller and slower. Enron became bumptious, impatient, lean, fast, innovative, and demanding. It bred speed and innovation by giving its professionals unusual freedom to start new businesses, create markets, and transfer within the firm.     Success was rewarded with ample compensation and fast promotion, and an open-office design fostered brainstorming. The firm's organization and culture was by all accounts not a safe haven for those who believe the role of a large corporation is to fulfill entitlements for jobs. This was a lightning rod for the firm's detractors. And yet, it could serve as a model for more hide-bound enterprises to emulate.     Enron was a prolific source of compelling new ideas about the transformation of American business. It created a ruckus in once-quiet corners of the business economy. It rewrote the rules of competition in almost every area in which it did business. It thrived on volatility.     The proposed sale of Enron to Dynegy risks the loss of a major R&D establishment, especially given Dynegy's track record as a second mover following Enron's lead. Beyond what is likely to be a difficult and time-consuming antitrust review, Dynegy's greater challenge will be to find a way to make Enron's spirit of innovation its own. Or so we all should hope, because prosperity depends on the ability of firms to reinvent themselves and remake their industries.     ---     Messrs.

Cc: Gadd, Eric Subject: Panda Energy Importance: High  Kevin--  As we discussed yesterday, Panda Energy International, Inc. and TECO Energy, Inc. (Tampa Electric) have formed a partnership to build, own, and operate a 2300 Mw gas-fired electric generation plant located in Maricopa County, Arizona, southwest of Phoenix.  The partnership may be called ""Panda Gila River L.P.""  Here are some of the details as we know them:  All building/ air permits received, construction has commenced  Financing closed 6/04/01 (oversubscribed by 56%)  $2.2 bn loan ($1.7bn 5 yr. bullet loan and $500mm equity bridge)  Financing led by Citibank and Societe Generale  50% of power output sold under long term contracts, 50% on spot market  What we want to know is:  How did the banks get comfortable on the financing if only 25% of the gas pipeline transport capacity is under contract? (And right now there is only one pipeline capable of serving the plant's needs) How did the banks get comfortable with only 50% of the power output sold under long term contracts?  What happens after the bullet loan comes due-- are the operators taking interest rate risk and hoping to refinance at a lower rate in year 5?  Any information you can provide on the above would be very helpful.  We are scheduled to meet with Panda in Dallas on Tuesday 11/6. thanks for the help.

"Kevin,  Here's some info on Gila Bend - - - please use with discretion.   -----Original Message----- From:  Young, Steve   Sent: Wednesday, November 21, 2001 4:43 PM To: Gadd, Eric Cc: McCarty, Danny Subject: Gila Bend (TECO-Panda deals)  Sensitivity: Confidential  Eric:  I spoke earlier today with the banker who led the TECO-Panda financing for Societe Generale (lead arranger with Citi on the $2.2 bill. merchant project financing).  Following is a summary of the call with healthy amount of detail since it may be some time before we have a chance to visit.  Due to confidentialities, Jim could only go so far on some details, so you'll note a number of gaps; however, this should cover many of your questions.  Call upon return after the holiday and we can discuss further.  Also attached - after notes - is an article that should capture many of the financing details.  Given other demands, I've not yet read the article so duplication between the notes and article is inevitable.  A word of caution - PFI details are good but not always accurate so rely principally on the call notes.  I also asked for portions of the Offering Memo. but am doubtful on receiving this.  Distribute further as you see fit.  Summary of Call This was a merchant financing with both projects (Phoenix and El Dorado, Arkansas) cross-collateralized and x-defaulted - so treated as a single financing.   Approx. 2250 MW per site for total of 4500 MW (with 4 separate units per site). Sources of funding - Total of $2.8 Bill. ($2.2 Bill in debt and $600 MM in funded equity).  Apparently all of the $600 MM equity was funded at close June 01' [further confirmation is needed].  Of the $2.2 Bill. in debt, $1.7 Bill. was non-recourse and $500 MM was an equity bridge, with recourse to partners.  However, lenders looked principally to TECO's credit backed by several guaranty of equity bridge and fronting of the $600 MM in funded equity. Partnership - 50/50 in all respects (ie. vote and economics).  However, TECO must have some preferential rights (eg. cash flows etc..) given their substantial commits on the deal.   Term of debt - 2 yrs. construct facility plus 3 yr. mini-perm with bullet at maturity (approx. 8% amortized at maturity).  Five years is the market for merchant deals.  Amortization is 18 yr. mortgage style.  144 A expected form of permanent take-out of term debt.   Leverage - 60% financed by term debt, but approx. 50% debt financed when adding all ancillary facilities and other commits (ie. working capital, letters of credit etc..).  Jim kept details to minimum but further info. is needed here. Key Ratio was debt service coverage.  Base Case assumed an average DSCR of 3.40X and Min. of 2.40X with cash trapped at 1.75X.  Did not get detail on whether DSCR was both historical and forward looking, but suspect there was some kind of forward test.  Project finance banks typically expect 3.25 to 4.25 DSCR on merchant finance deals. Leverage, DSCR and structure in general was done based on what is generally required to gain investment grade rating from agencies when permanent take-out is sought.  Additional rating agency requirements can be found on Moody's and S&P web sites.   TECO also will act as operator.  TECO was clearly crucial to deal and at least Soc. Gen. had done prior deals with them (not sure about Citi).  Panda brought TECO into the deals.  Although Panda was a known quantity, Soc. Gen. had no direct project history with them. Fuel and Power Off take - Lenders looked to extensive an Energy Management Program analysis.  The EMP presumed (by C.O.D.):  50% of fuel and power would be under firm contract, 25% of each would be covered by seasonal swing contracts and remaining 25% would remain merchant.  Intention is a complete match (term and volumes) for fuel and power contracts.  Agency agreements were signed with Noble (1yr. contract) on fuel supply mgt. and Aquilla (2 yr. contract) for managing power sales.  Each buys in name of the projects.  TECO is responsible for overall energy mgt. and coordination between Noble and Aquilla.  Jim said EOD is triggered if fuel and power agreements are not signed in line with E.M. Program by C.O.D.  Lenders got comfortable with lack of fuel and power contracts due to substantial equity commitment (approx. $1.1 Bill.). Consultants were Pace for fuel supply and overall energy management and RW Beck for power market eval. Fuel Transport - Much of medium term contracted at close (mix of firm and interruptible capacity) out to 7 yrs.  Lenders looked to new and released capacity to fill non-contracted needs.         -----Original Message----- From:  Young, Steve   Sent: 01 November 2001 22:45 To: Gadd, Eric Subject: RE: Gila Bend Sensitivity: Confidential  Will continue to dig.  Thanks for the greater detail on the questions.  I don't expect much but will let you know if anything notable comes of the call.    SY   -----Original Message----- From:  Gadd, Eric   Sent: 01 November 2001 18:35 To: Young, Steve Subject: RE: Gila Bend Sensitivity: Confidential  Thanks for the quick response.  The objective at ETS is to arrange a long term gas transportation agreement with the Gila Bend project.  We estimate their requirements to be 386,000 MMBtus/day and understand that El Paso has agreed to provide 100,000 MMBtus/day.  Gila Bend is one of several potential strategic shippers for our project and we are extremely interested in the credit quality of their project, recourse to parents, etc.  Principle risks + mitigants to understand: Gas supply arrangements Gas transportation arrangements Financing arrangements, sources of funds Power off-take arrangements Who is the Operator? Ownership structure, decision-making, etc. Financial recourse to parents   -----Original Message----- From:  Young, Steve   Sent: Thursday, November 01, 2001 5:37 PM To: Gadd, Eric Subject: Gila Bend  I spoke with the project bankers at one of the lead banks (principal underwriters) here in town.  They are scheduling a call for me with the banker who lead the deal on their side.  I will be asking about fuel supply issues, key risks, terms etc.  Forward any additional questions you have and/or provide more specific questions of fuel etc.. and I'll give it a go.  I also asked for the Offering Memo., which will be near impossible to get due to confidentiality issues but will let you know how it goes.  Let's visit about you attending as well.

" Sorry, Kevin.  I thought I had copied you on this.   -----Original Message----- From:  Dickerson, Steve V   Sent: Friday, November 16, 2001 1:15 PM To: Kilmer III, Robert Subject: Sun Devil/Sonoran Pipeline Importance: High  Rob,  I need your expert advice before conducting further negotiations with Kinder Morgan (KM).  As you may be aware, the Sun Devil project parallels the Transwestern (TW) system to Flagstaff, AZ and will then turn south and parallel a El Paso lateral into Phoenix.  KM has made a proposal to provide services to TW under a ""lease transaction"" for that portion of the pipeline from San Juan, NM to Flagstaff.  The KM proposal offers two obvious advantages: i)  It would allow TW to lower its capital cost to construct the total system, and ii) It would lower the fuel allocated to Sun Devil by TW. There also may be ways to further reduce the tariff proposed to Sun Devil by KM, if TW can provide some of the operations and administration services for KM.  We have been negotiating with Shippers for a fee that would yield a minimum rate of return based upon our proposal to build and own the entire system.  However, the KM proposal could allow us an opportunity to save on fuel, operating, administrative and capital costs, thus possibly achieving better project returns, if TW is able to capture revenues from these savings. We would like to explore assessing the Sun Devil Shippers an allocated fuel rate and other fees commensurate with TW's current rate structure.  Will FERC regulations permit us to do these things?  Should the Sun Devil Pipeline be part of TW or should it be under some other corporate structure to capture revenues?  Does the lease transaction give TW an accounting or tax benefit?  I have attached the KM proposal for your perusal.  Please keep it confidential.  Thank you for your help.

"Steve, below is a partial answer to most of your questions.  Can we set a time for Wednesday afternoon 12/5 to talk?  thanks   Max Hourly Quantity:  we are reviewing capability to deliver the MHQ in a 16 hr block.  Doesn't appear to be any problem.  What will be the plant's complete hourly capability?  Contract Rate:  will be a negotiated rate (eliminates rate risk for Gila).  The rate design is currently one-part (no differentiation between reservation and commodity).  The rate does not include AGA / GRI surcharges or fuel.  It covers a minimal return on the project's capital cost plus the ongoing O&M.  Fuel Rate:  TW does not track and adjust for actual fuel percentages.  Fuel was settled with shippers in the 1996 rate case; the offer to Panda is consistent with the current tariff.  Delivery Term:  as the term gets shorter, the rate by necessity, goes up to cover the return hurdles.  Services:  delivery pressure at the Panda / EPNG interconnect should be a minimum 750 #  Capacity of the lateral from Copper Eagle to EPNG will be 500,000 Dth/d.  Alternative rec/del combinations:  Our thought here was if Panda is willing to commit to taking capacity in the project, then TW would give you all the necessary flexibility to move gas to other destinations at the Contract rate.  For instance, Panda would be paying a one-part rate for delivery to the plant.  If for some reason, plant demand was reduced, then you would have all the flexibility to move gas to alternative markets.    Backhaul:  the 50,000/day would be a guarantee.  Daily imbalances, short notice start up/ shut down:  We have to plan for the worst case scenario and assume there is no storage.  With this in mind, TW will have some flexibility just due to the size of the project (36"" pipe and 750 - 900 # pressure) but this will depend on what other shippers are doing.

We plan to loop the existing San Juan lateral and mainline systems, plus build a new lateral from Flagstaff to Phoenix, AZ.  The project also includes several compressor additions.  We are negotiating with several large gas-fired electric generators in the Phoenix area to take capacity on the new project.  One of our current challenges is how to finance the project with the lowest cost of capital; one structure we are considering is a prepay.  Ideally, the customer would prepay for a portion of his transport up front, once the project goes in service.  All the prepaid contracts together would cover a majority of the initial construction cost ($911mm).  The question to you is:  1) if the customer prepays the transport contract, does TW have to pay the tax on the funds when they're received?  2) is there a way to structure around paying the tax in year one, maybe using some deferred tax liability basis?   If TW has to pay a tax on the funds, and we collect from the customer a gross-up for tax purposes, then my feeling is the pre-pay structure will be too expensive.  Please let me know your thoughts at your earliest convenience.  thanks Kevin Hyatt x35559",kevin.hyatt@enron.com,robert.guthrie@enron.com,RE: Sun Devil Pre-paid contracts,2001-12-10 09:23:23-08:00,received

" You asked me to research the following question: what is the value at risk to TW if we lower the fuel rate to Sun Devil shippers.  I assumed we would only lower the rate to Phoenix shippers (500,000/day).  If we lower their fuel from 4.75% to 3.75%, based on a $2.50 gas price, the opportunity lost to TW is $4.56mm per annum.    System wide, once Sun Devil comes in service, every quarter point reduction in TW fuel = $4.6mm in lost revenue assuming a $2.50 gas price.    Again, system wide once SD comes in service, if we wanted to target an equivalent fuel revenue in 2005 to the fuel revenue before SD in 2003, our required tariff fuel rate would need to be 3.26%.  Remember, we are increasing the total system thruput from 1.2 Bcf/d up to 2.02 Bcf/d AND lowering the overall system fuel consumption.  This has a double positive impact to the fuel calculation.    So, the point is, we should be willing to negotiate a fuel rate with SD shippers and anything above 3.26% is gravy compared to where we are today.    Note time of email.

"Good morning, Kevin!  My name is Mark Putnam and I am contacting you on behalf of our company, EULAN Corporation.  I read the Houston Chronicle article on Enron Kids yesterday and I must say I was very impressed. EULAN is a business analysis and documentation firm who worked for Enron for over a year. I myself spent a year on site working with some of Enron's people--all bright and motivated people--and I have been greatly disturbed by the recent events that are transpiring. All of the folks that I had the chance to work with are good people, and I hate to see anything affect them negatively, especially during the holidays.  I wanted to let you know about a particular service that EULAN offers to non-profit organizations. Grant writing is a service that often times NPOs do not have the time or expertise to look into. EULAN's grant writers offer experience, knowledge, and the time that Enron Kids' personnel may not have. I know that the program's future is in question, and would like to discuss how we can help.  I'm sure you're quite busy with the holiday's right now, but feel free to reply to this email address or give me a call at 713-962-0907. I would be happy to discuss the possibilities available to you or maybe set a meeting for after the holidays.  We look forward to hearing from you!

Sun Devil Pipeline Project  Marketing -- Meetings scheduled for week of 1/7 with power generators Salt River Project and AZ Public Service in Phoenix.

Engineering - is exploring options to reduce compressor costs and overall project costs.  Their goal is $100 million in reductions.  Will regroup 1/18 to review  potential reduction areas weighed against operational flexibility and volume.  Storage - we are exploring ways to offer a limited firm Park N Ride service on the new project; this would help compete against the proposed salt dome storage and may garner a larger market share for Sun Devil.

"Hi Steve and Bob, Happy New Year!!  Steve, based on our meeting in Houston, I met with our engineering and operations folks to discuss the possibility of putting together a new firm (or limited firm) Park N Ride storage service on the pipeline project.  Everyone agreed it is likely doable under certain conditions not the least of which is FERC approval.  The question I have for you is: how much volume and for how long a period?  For example, on any given day, assuming there is no Copper Eagle storage available, it will likely be easier to borrow (ride) gas off the system than to park gas on it.  I think this was your greater concern.    In your ideal world, how much volume would you like to be able to pull off Sun Devil say if your MDQ was 100,000?  Would you want an additional 25,000/day, more or less? and for how long?  Also, how much would you want to Park on the system and for how long?  For purposes of evaluation, assume the cost would be significantly less than a storage option.  If you give me some parameters, we will build a service offering that meets your needs as close as possible.    I will be out of the office on Friday 1/4 but look forward to hearing from you early next week.

"FYI--Meant to include you in the original distribution.   Thought you might find several sections of interest, especially Chapter 3 which includes data on gas-fired electric generating plants.  gh   -----Original Message----- From:  Hass, Glen   Sent: Friday, January 04, 2002 10:59 AM To: Kilmer III, Robert; Lokey, Teb; Lichtenwalter, Blair; Rapp, Bill; McCarty, Danny; Donoho, Lindy; Harris, Steven; Lindberg, Lorraine; Lohman, TK; Lokay, Michelle; McConnell, Mark; Watson, Kimberly; Y'barbo, Paul Subject: CPUC Infrastructure Report  As reported in Gas Daily today, the CPUC has issued a report assessing the state's gas infrastructure of the three major utilities in California.  Their conclusion is that the natural gas transportation and storage systems are adequate to provide seasonally reliable amounts of competitively priced natural gas to residential, commercial, industrial and electric generation customers.  Therefore they recommend that the Power Authority should not finance any new natural gas projects.  Other conclusions: conservation will reduce demand on the infrastructure, improved coordination between electric and gas operations can enhance reliability, and the CPUC should continue to evaluate the need for gas infrastructure expansions.

"Sun Devil Pipeline Project  Marketing -- At our Phoenix meeting, Salt River Project (SRP), the nation's 3rd largest public utility, announced an open season for a new 10 Bcf underground gas storage project just north of Kingman, Arizona.  The project's scope includes a pipe for taking gas from the Kern River system near Las Vegas, delivering to storage, then re-delivering the volume via interconnects with Transwestern, El Paso's north system, plus a new lateral going south reach El Paso near Wenden, AZ.  SRP's partners include Allegheny Energy and Sempra Energy Resources.  There is an opportunity here to combine the project benefits of Sun Devil with the pipeline proposed for the storage facility.  We will pursue this at the open house meeting hosted by SRP next week.  SRP expects regulatory approval in late 2003; the open season runs until February 8, 2002.  --  Met with APS to discuss peaking capability and the possibility of firm Park N Ride services to compete with their storage alternative at Copper Eagle.  The current western gas market has taken much of their urgency out of pursuing underground storage in Phoenix at this time.  We offered to give APS a contract ""out"" up until we file our FERC application if they would agree to reimburse us for the EIS costs.  We are preparing a written offer to be delivered next week.    --  Panda Energy:  expect a response to our market proposal during the week of 1/14.  We are formulating a proposal to offer firm Park N Ride services based on the project's hydraulic capability.  Engineering -  a revised project scope has been submitted to reduce compressor and looping costs.  The goal is $100 million in reductions.  Will regroup 1/18 to review  potential reduction areas weighed against operational flexibility and volume.  FERC and El Paso Full Requirements Contracts - The discussion of the Strawman settlement proposal submitted by SRP to FERC did not make it on FERC's January agenda.  At our meeting this week, APS did not put much faith in the Strawman making much forward progress.

Although you'd have to be a CPA or finance-type to appreciate fully the depth of the apparent deception and subtlety of the accounting methods mentioned in her letter, I'm struck by Ms. Watkin's candor, and how she offers a truthful assessment of the landscape and even a prescription for how Enron might claw its way back from this brinksmanship.  Unfortunately, it now appears this letter came ""too little, too late,"" and in any event, went unheeded.   Suffice it to say this whole debacle makes me sick and a little ashamed for having been associated (by employment) with the perpetrators of this farce.  Although the gas pipeline group I worked for apparently never took part in these shenanigans (we made our money the old fashioned way -- we earned it), as Ms. Watkins says, my ""Enron work history will now be worth nothing on my resume.""   Hard lessons have been learned by everyone, and the repercussions will be felt for years to come.  I saw this quote today in Restructuring Today and thought it was poignant:   What's important:  Beyond the many other issues -- including the appropriateness of time in an upscale correctional facility for people we have considered business friends -- what really matters is that the checks and balances our society has created for the world of commerce failed miserably.  It would be shocking if Auther Andersen survives as an auditor of anything.  Even so, our system needs radical improvement.    <http://abcnews.go.com/sections/pdf/layletter020115.pdf>",pavenditti@yahoo.com,kevin.hyatt@enron.com,FW: Link to Sherron Watkins letter,2002-01-16 08:37:50-08:00,sent

"   -----Original Message----- From:  Enron Office Of The Chairman   Sent: Wednesday, January 23, 2002 8:10 PM To: DL-GA-all_enron_worldwide1 Subject: Message from Ken Lay  Earlier today, I stepped down as Enron's Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer.  This decision was reached in cooperation with Enron's Board and the Creditor Committee and is effective immediately.  To emerge from bankruptcy, Enron needs a CEO who can focus 100 percent of his or her efforts on rebuilding the company.  Unfortunately, with multiple inquiries and investigations that require my immediate attention, at this time I am unable to fully concentrate on what is most important to Enron's stakeholders - preserving value for our creditors and our dedicated employees.  The Creditor Committee has begun a search for a restructuring specialist to serve as interim CEO to help the company emerge from bankruptcy.  This individual will join Enron's remaining management team to direct the company's ongoing operations.  I truly believe Enron can and will survive.  I will remain a Director of the Board to help see that it does.  During my time at Enron, I have witnessed tremendous change and opportunity.  I have seen people rigorously grow and maintain one of the world's most efficient and safest gas pipeline networks; I have seen people dedicate themselves to a cause that became a passion - the opening of energy markets; I have observed smart people come together as a team to build creative solutions like EnronOnline; and I have watched people tirelessly give of themselves to help their fellow employees and those in the community.  Regardless of what has happened, I am proud of so much of what we were able to accomplish here.  Thank you for your contributions to the company and for the inspiration you have been to me over the years.

Facility >UCU Jan 31 at 15:20    ( BW)(MO-AQUILA)(UCU) Aquila Set to Develop Arizona Gas Storage Facility   Business Editors   KANSAS CITY, Mo.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Jan. 31, 2002--Aquila, the wholly owned subsidiary of UtiliCorp United (NYSE: UCU), announced today that it has purchased the Red Lake Storage Project from Southwest Gas Corporation.   The purchase includes 36,000 acres approximately 30 miles north of Kingman, Arizona, and the rights to develop a salt cavern storage facility. Along with the land, Aquila purchased the water and mineral rights necessary to develop the facility.   The facility will have a gas storage capacity of 12 billion cubic feet (Bcf). The first phase of the facility, with a storage capacity of 6 Bcf, is expected to be in operation by the fourth quarter of 2003, with the full 12 Bcf planned for the fourth quarter of 2004. The facility will connect to pipelines operated by El Paso Natural Gas Pipeline and Transwestern Pipeline Company. Aquila anticipates beginning an open season for the facility within the next seven to ten days. In an open season period a company seeks storages commitments from potential clients.   ""This facility fits with our strategy to build or acquire assets that enable us to provide clients with the energy they need when they encounter dramatic increases in demand,"" said Ed Mills, president and chief operating officer of Aquila.   The facility is positioned to serve Arizona power plants, as well as other facilities in Nevada and California. There are approximately 60 gas-fired power plants in Arizona, representing one of the largest single concentrations of such facilities in the United States   ""Southwest Gas Corporation is pleased to see the Red Lakes Storage Project being developed,"" said Ed Zub, executive vice president of Southwest Gas Corporation. ""Development of this project will benefit the states of Arizona and Nevada where Southwest Gas Corporation serves more than 1.1 million customers.""   Aquila currently owns one of the largest independent storage facilities in the southwest, a 21 Bcf facility in Katy, Texas. The company is also currently completing the acquisition of a storage facility near Lodi, California, which will provide gas to the frequently energy-short cities in northern California. With the addition of the Red Lake Storage Project, Aquila will be one of the largest independent storage providers for power plants and local gas distribution companies in the Southwest.   Based in Kansas City, Aquila is a leading wholesaler of natural gas, power and coal in North America and provider of risk management services. Aquila also provides wholesale energy and risk management services in the United Kingdom, Germany and Scandinavia. Aquila is wholly owned by Kansas City-based UtiliCorp United, an international energy company with 4 million customers across the U.S. and in Canada, the United Kingdom, New Zealand and Australia.

" Marketing  --  Red Lake / (Pataya) Storage  - per the press release, Aquila has purchased 100% of this project being developed by SouthWest Gas.  The proposed 12 Bcf facility, located 30 miles north of Kingman, Arizona near the terminus of TW, will begin its open season the week Feb. 4.  They anticipate tying into both TW and El Paso.  We are exploring options with Aquila to tie in the Sun Devil project plus a new compressor at Kingman, AZ.  The compressor will help Aquila buck TW's line pressure plus facilitate pressure requirements at the California border for TW.  --  Drafting new marketing proposals to both APS and Panda based on the lowered facility costs.     Engineering -  New facility costs are estimated at $831 million and include an additional lateral to serve the APS Red Hawk plant.  Capacity to Phoenix will be 750,000 MMBtu/d with only 30,000/d available for Cal Border.  This is a $100 million improvement versus our original scenario.  The improvements are based on reduced pipe looping to serve Cal Border plus reduced or eliminated compressor stations.  The benefit is reflected in a lower initial capital cost plus lower annual operating expenses.  Rates to Phoenix are estimated at $0.45/MMBtu on a 20 year term with a project salvage value of less than $200mm at the end of the initial term.

"I just spoke with Curt Brechtel from APS this morning.  I had called him last week asking for feedback related to our latest Sun Devil offer to them.  He reviewed our offer with Tom Carlson.  Tom has 2 issues (listed by priority):  1) Enron credit rating and where the pipelines stand with the current financial situation.   Do we have a timeline wherein the pipes (specifically TW) will have its own credit rating?  2) Full requirements contract settlement at FERC   APS still has no idea where this process will lead as far as their volume requirements are concerned.

"   **********************************              Time To Use Your Draft     **********************************  Presidents' Day weekend is a great time to buy a car  The approaching holiday is the perfect time to use your E-LOAN check draft to buy a car.  Save money by combining President's day dealer sales with E-LOAN's low loan rates.  Use the following tips to ensure that you get the best deal possible:  1.  Do your research - Research your car's invoice price and MSRP before you visit the dealer.  Click here for more information. <a href="" http://eloan.rsc03.net/servlet/cc4?LsgEWCB*rLOpgEoSHmmQLgkhgEJht*z*UA "">  2.  Talk to the Internet Sales Manager - Dealing directly with the ISM can often help you negotiate  the best price for your car.   3.  Determine your monthly payment - You can affect your monthly payment by adjusting the term  of your loan. Use E-LOAN's auto payment calculator to design a payment structure that works for you.  <a href="" http://eloan.rsc03.net/servlet/cc4?LsgEWCB*rLOpgEoSHmmQLgkhgEJht*z*VA "">  4.  Maximize your trade-in - Sell your existing car yourself to maximize its value. If you do trade it in,  clean and repair your car to enhance its appeal.   5.  Determine your down payment - Down payment is a matter of preference. However, thanks to your low E-LOAN rate your cash may be better used elsewhere. Use Manufacturer Rebates and  Cash Back Incentives to reduce the amount you have to finance.   Remember, using your E-LOAN check draft is easy. Once you've negotiated the price for your car, simply fill out and sign the draft and provide the required documentation to the Internet Sales Manager.  Then drive away in your new car!  If you have any questions about your loan please feel free to call our toll free number 1-888-E-LOAN-22!

"***** NEW Documents Available From CAEM Free of Charge *****   The Center for the Advancement of Energy Markets (CAEM) is pleased to announce the availability of two ground-breaking documents -- ""The Role of the Federal Government in Distributed Energy"" and ""The Role of the Default Provider in Restructured Energy Markets"" -- that are available free of charge.  To access the documents, visit us at our web site -- www.caem.org     After over 6 months of intensive work by CAEM's Distributed Energy Task Force, CAEM is releasing a comprehensive report on the ""THE ROLE OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IN DISTRIBUTED ENERGY"" prepared by Nat Treadway, a CAEM Senior Research Fellow, and Ed Reid, CAEM's Senior Technology Fellow.     The report describes the major Federal government activities that encourage or hamper the commercialization of distributed energy (DE) and recommends changes that could allow DE to play a more significant role as a choice among competing energy services.  The overarching conclusion of the report is that unless the Federal government takes affirmative steps to promote DE, the existing policies, regulations, and business practices will continue to hamper its development.  The report makes a number of recommendations that will be important to policymakers at both the federal and state levels of government.  This 70-page report is a must read for stakeholders interested in distributed energy.     A white paper on ""THE ROLE OF THE DEFAULT PROVIDER IN RESTRUCTURING ENERGY MARKETS"" was prepared by Ron Sutherland, a CAEM Scholar, as part of CAEM's DISCO of the Future Forum.     The paper offers an insightful analysis and critique of the current models utilized by states to offer default service.  The conclusions are summarized at the end of the paper, but the main result is noted here. Each state implicitly adopts a model of competition in its electricity and gas markets.  This model then influences (if not determines) the choice of default provider.  The commonly accepted model of competition permits the local utility to remain a competitor in the merchant function, where the utility is likely to be the default provider.  In the restructuring efforts of those few states where the utility exits the merchant function, an energy supply company is likely to be the default provider.  Various risks, inefficiencies or non-competitive elements do not result from the choice of default provider, but from other elements in the transition process.  Price caps are the major factor contributing to risks and inefficiencies where the utility or an independent energy provider is the default provider.  That is, it is not the default service provider framework, per se, that is responsible for the risks. The purpose of this study is descriptive not prescriptive, however a tentative suggestion is offered.  Few customers will require default service if energy service providers have incentives to offer service at pricing and other terms that cover costs.  If the need for default service occurs, customers will most likely obtain service if the default provider can offer service at pricing and other terms that cover costs.

"Sun Devil Marketing  --  Met with Panda Energy and Tampa Electric officials and discussed the latest transport proposal.  The pricing and term were well received.  We have forwarded to Panda an outline of the credit terms TW will need as well as supply contacts and points available to them in the San Juan basin.  We are also evaluating a reverse-tilt transport offer to provide them with a lower rate in the early years, but the rate may not be enough to provide adequate coverage ratios for the pipeline project.  -- Arizona Public Service - APS responded this week to our latest offer.  Their concerns were (1) TW credit in the face of the current Enron bankruptcy, and (2) our volume offer of 200,000/day in light of the current El Paso full requirements debate.  As for credit, we forwarded to APS the current update on TW's efforts with the various rating agencies and our timeline for getting a new rating established.  For volume, APS may be willing to sign up for less volume and forgo the ""out"" clause, but this puts more of the early development risk on TW for capital required to file the FERC application.  -- Project Engineering - with Doug Cebryk's resignation, the Sun Devil project has been forwarded to Arnold Eisenstein.","eric.gadd@enron.com, susan.wadle@enron.com",kevin.hyatt@enron.com,weekly update 2/15,2002-02-14 13:48:58-08:00,sent

"TW currently owns a section of pipe called the Gomez lateral located south of TW's West Texas #2 compressor station.  The lateral is approximately 35 miles long and is a 20-inch diameter pipeline.  The Gomez lateral is currently not in service and is filled with sweet gas.  Per Field Operations personnel, the last time the line was used was October 31, 2000.    Pioneer Gas Pipeline is an intratstate gathering and transmission company.  Pioneer has expressed a written interest in acquiring the lateral from TW for $2 million.  Current book value on the line is ______________ .

"    Development of Sonoran Pipeline Project Halted  02/15/2002  PR Newswire  (Copyright (c) 2002, PR Newswire)  HOUSTON, Feb. 15 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Kinder Morgan Energy Partners, L.P. (NYSE: KMP) and Calpine Corporation (NYSE: CPN) today announced the termination of the proposed Sonoran Pipeline project. The Sonoran Pipeline was unable to secure sufficient binding commitments to make a successful project given market conditions. Securing firm transportation agreements was a stipulation that executives of both companies initially stated was necessary before development of the project could begin. Neither company has spent significant dollars on the proposed development of the pipeline and it was not expected to begin service until 2004.  Both KMP and Calpine will continue to evaluate other opportunities to serve the growing California market.  Phase I of the proposed Sonoran Pipeline would have extended from the Blanco Hub and terminated near Needles and Topock, Calif., with the possibility of a second phase extending into northern California.  Based in San Jose, Calif., Calpine Corporation is an independent power company that is dedicated to providing customers with clean, efficient, natural gas-fired power generation. It generates and markets power, through plants it develops, owns and operates, in 29 states in the United States, three provinces in Canada and in the United Kingdom. Calpine also is the world's largest producer of renewable geothermal energy, and it owns 1.3 trillion cubic feet equivalent of proved natural gas reserves in Canada and the United States. The company was founded in 1984 and is publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol CPN. For more information about Calpine, visit its website at www.calpine.com .  Kinder Morgan Energy Partners, L. P. is the nation's largest pipeline master limited partnership with an enterprise value of approximately $9 billion. KMP owns and operates more than 20,000 miles of pipelines and over 70 terminals. Its pipelines transport more than two million barrels per day of gasoline and other petroleum products and up to 4.3 billion cubic feet per day of natural gas. Its terminals handle over 50 million tons of coal and other bulk materials annually and have a liquids storage capacity of more than 53 million barrels for petroleum products and chemicals. KMP is also the leading provider in the U.S. of CO2, which is used in enhanced oil recovery projects.

We are also evaluating a reverse-tilt transport offer to provide them with a lower rate in the early years, but the rate may not be enough to provide adequate coverage ratios for the pipeline project.  -- Arizona Public Service - APS responded this week to our latest offer.  Their concerns were (1) TW credit in the face of the current Enron bankruptcy, and (2) our volume offer of 200,000/day in light of the current El Paso full requirements debate.  As for credit, we forwarded to APS the current update on TW's efforts with the various rating agencies and our timeline for getting a new rating established.  For volume, APS may be willing to sign up for less volume and forgo the ""out"" clause, but this puts more of the early development risk on TW for capital required to file the FERC application.  -- Project Engineering - with Doug Cebryk's resignation, the Sun Devil project has been forwarded to Arnold Eisenstein.",bruce.tuttle@enron.com,kevin.hyatt@enron.com,FW: weekly update 2/15,2002-02-19 07:01:25-08:00,sent

Gina  Development of Sonoran Pipeline Project Halted  02/15/2002  PR Newswire  (Copyright (c) 2002, PR Newswire)  HOUSTON, Feb. 15 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Kinder Morgan Energy Partners, L.P. (NYSE: KMP) and Calpine Corporation (NYSE: CPN) today announced the termination of the proposed Sonoran Pipeline project. The Sonoran Pipeline was unable to secure sufficient binding commitments to make a successful project given market conditions. Securing firm transportation agreements was a stipulation that executives of both companies initially stated was necessary before development of the project could begin. Neither company has spent significant dollars on the proposed development of the pipeline and it was not expected to begin service until 2004.  Both KMP and Calpine will continue to evaluate other opportunities to serve the growing California market.  Phase I of the proposed Sonoran Pipeline would have extended from the Blanco Hub and terminated near Needles and Topock, Calif., with the possibility of a second phase extending into northern California.  Based in San Jose, Calif., Calpine Corporation is an independent power company that is dedicated to providing customers with clean, efficient, natural gas-fired power generation. It generates and markets power, through plants it develops, owns and operates, in 29 states in the United States, three provinces in Canada and in the United Kingdom. Calpine also is the world's largest producer of renewable geothermal energy, and it owns 1.3 trillion cubic feet equivalent of proved natural gas reserves in Canada and the United States. The company was founded in 1984 and is publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol CPN. For more information about Calpine, visit its website at www.calpine.com .  Kinder Morgan Energy Partners, L. P. is the nation's largest pipeline master limited partnership with an enterprise value of approximately $9 billion. KMP owns and operates more than 20,000 miles of pipelines and over 70 terminals. Its pipelines transport more than two million barrels per day of gasoline and other petroleum products and up to 4.3 billion cubic feet per day of natural gas. Its terminals handle over 50 million tons of coal and other bulk materials annually and have a liquids storage capacity of more than 53 million barrels for petroleum products and chemicals. KMP is also the leading provider in the U.S. of CO2, which is used in enhanced oil recovery projects. ",michelle.lokay@enron.com,kevin.hyatt@enron.com,FW: Article,2002-02-19 08:40:52-08:00,sent

"Economics:  Pioneer has offered $2mm for pipe that has a current book value of $533,000.  Replacement value of the pipe is roughly $26.8mm.  Potential Buyers: Sid Richardson has previously expressed an interest in the lateral.  Other area gathering companies include Duke, El Paso, and Western Gas Resources.  I've contacted Kim Watson about getting Richardson engaged.  I'll use the TW marketing Team to make contacts at the other companies.    Pioneer has executed the confidentiality agreement.

The lateral is approximately 35 miles long and is a 20-inch diameter pipeline.  The Gomez lateral is currently not in service and is filled with sweet gas.  Per Field Operations personnel, the last time the line was used was October 31, 2000.    Pioneer Gas Pipeline is an intratstate gathering and transmission company.  Pioneer has expressed a written interest in acquiring the lateral from TW for $2 million.  Current book value on the line is ______________ .  TW could file with FERC for abandonment of the pipe (and sale) under the existing blanket authority if:  1) no IT gas has flowed for the 12 months prior to effective date of the sale or;  2) no FT shipper has a firm receipt or delivery point on the lateral for the 12 months prior...If an FT shipper does have a valid contract on the lateral, then we would need to get the shipper to amend his contract to effectuate the sale.   Items to Verify:  1) Identify any entity currently having firm receipt or delivery rights on the Gomez lateral  2) Determine volume of gas in pipe and associated value for sale (field ops is checking)   Opportunities for TW: By Pioneer puchasing and integrating the lateral into their system, they can effectuate incremental supply deliveries into TW.  This would reduce the amount of gas necessary for TW to transport south of WT-2 (via displacement) and make more supply available for deliveries going west.

"FYI--Didn't know if you were tracking this plant, but thought you find the = ACC decision of interest.  gh     COMMISSION APPROVES BOWIE POWER PROJECT  Requires Use of Solor Technology &=  Groundwater Monitoring Program=09 PHOENIX - In a decision yesterday, the Arizona Corporation Commission appro= ved the Bowie Power Station proposed for eastern Cochise County in southeas= tern Arizona. The project, to be constructed in two 500-megawatt phases, is=  a water-cooled power plant using a maximum of 6,000 acre-feet of groundwat= er per year when both units are operating continuously at full output. Sout= hWestern Power Group II is the project developer. The approval requires Sou= thWestern to install solar technology when they begin building the second p= ower block. This is the first merchant power plant that is required to inco= rporate solar technology as a core part of the total project. Merchant powe= r plants supply power to the wholesale market as opposed to power plants bu= ilt by a utility with the primary objective of serving its own customers. D= uring Tuesday's meeting, the Commission accepted the 22 restrictions placed=  on the project by the Arizona Power Plant and Transmission Line Siting Com= mittee. After hearing from several representatives of the Bowie and Willcox=  communities, the Commissioners approved an amendment offered by Commission= er Spitzer. The Spitzer amendment specifically addresses concerns by nearby=  pistachio farmers that groundwater pumping could affect the surrounding wa= ter table. Summary of the Spitzer Amendment: The amendment requires SouthWe= stern Power Group II to establish and pay for a groundwater monitoring prog= ram that meets Arizona Department of Water Resources criteria. Once the pro= ject is operating, the SouthWestern will have to establish and make annual = contributions of $100,000 to a Groundwater Impact Mitigation Fund until the=  fund reaches a balance of $500,000. Any business or individual who can pro= ve, through successful arbitration, that groundwater pumping has caused pro= perty or economic damage will be able to submit a claim for reimbursement. = SouthWestern will be required to maintain a total balance of $500,000 in th= e fund. Status reports on the program are to be filed with the Town of Bowi= e, the Pistachio Pass Irrigation District and the Cochise County Board of S= upervisors. The Groundwater Impact Mitigation Fund must be maintained for t= hree years after the plant ceases operation and is decommissioned. Commissi= oner Marc Spitzer said the amendment was prudent considering that the lasti= ng impact of the power project. ""I proposed this amendment to answer the co= ncerns of the pistachio farmers and the irrigation district,"" Commissioner = Marc Spitzer said. ""Although we heard testimony that the power plant's grou= ndwater needs would be less than if the land were farmed, I don't think you=  can be too careful. We're making decisions that could affect an economical= ly depressed area for generations to come."" Other Environmental Conditions:=  Twenty-two conditions were imposed by the Arizona Power Plant and Transmis= sion Line Siting Committee. They include: ? Establishment of a monitoring p= roject and mitigation fund for ground subsidence and earth fissure monitori= ng. Subsidence is a potential side effect of groundwater pumping. Cracks, f= issures or dips can form in the surface of the earth because the water deep=  underground that provided physical support is no longer there. ? Contribut= ions to the Bowie Fire District to enable it to acquire an additional emerg= ency services vehicle as well as funding of emergency response and hazardou= s materials training for firefighters. ? Making arrangements with local law=  enforcement and the Cochise County Sheriff because the project will involv= e an increase in traffic and may result in the need for emergency responses=  by local law enforcement. This was an amendment sponsored by Commissioner = Jim Irvin. ? Prior to construction of the facility, SouthWestern must provi= de the Commission with a technical study showing that sufficient transmissi= on capacity exists to accommodate the output of the plant and the effect of=  its output on reliable operation of the electric grid. ? Conditions requir= ing compliance with air and water quality standards imposed by the Arizona = Department of Environmental Quality and the Arizona Department of Water Res= ources. Additionally, the applicant will have to participate in and comply = with all standards for safe, reliable power delivery. ""I was pleased to sup= port this project, in part because it includes solar technology as a key co= mponent of the whole project. The level of support from the local community=  was also impressive. Les Thompson, Chairman of the Cochise County Board of=  Supervisors indicated that Bowie has one of the highest tax rates of any A= rizona community,"" Chairman Bill Mundell explained. ""The residents and busi= ness people were very excited about the tax and economic development benefi= ts of having the power plant in their community. Additionally, the project = will bring several hundred construction jobs to Bowie and Willcox and, ulti= mately, the 30 or 40 people needed to run the plant."" Commissioner Irvin vo= ted in favor of the project, saying: ""I do believe the need for this projec= t was established in the record. Further, I believe the project is in the p= ublic interest and meets the balancing test."" He was referring to the sitin= g statute that requires the Commission ""to balance, in the broad public int= erest, the need for an adequate, economical and reliable supply of electric=  power with the desire to minimize the effect thereof on the environment an= d ecology of this state.""

Sout= hWestern Power Group II is the project developer. The approval requires Sou= thWestern to install solar technology when they begin building the second p= ower block. This is the first merchant power plant that is required to inco= rporate solar technology as a core part of the total project. Merchant powe= r plants supply power to the wholesale market as opposed to power plants bu= ilt by a utility with the primary objective of serving its own customers. D= uring Tuesday's meeting, the Commission accepted the 22 restrictions placed=  on the project by the Arizona Power Plant and Transmission Line Siting Com= mittee. After hearing from several representatives of the Bowie and Willcox=  communities, the Commissioners approved an amendment offered by Commission= er Spitzer. The Spitzer amendment specifically addresses concerns by nearby=  pistachio farmers that groundwater pumping could affect the surrounding wa= ter table. Summary of the Spitzer Amendment: The amendment requires SouthWe= stern Power Group II to establish and pay for a groundwater monitoring prog= ram that meets Arizona Department of Water Resources criteria. Once the pro= ject is operating, the SouthWestern will have to establish and make annual = contributions of $100,000 to a Groundwater Impact Mitigation Fund until the=  fund reaches a balance of $500,000. Any business or individual who can pro= ve, through successful arbitration, that groundwater pumping has caused pro= perty or economic damage will be able to submit a claim for reimbursement. = SouthWestern will be required to maintain a total balance of $500,000 in th= e fund. Status reports on the program are to be filed with the Town of Bowi= e, the Pistachio Pass Irrigation District and the Cochise County Board of S= upervisors. The Groundwater Impact Mitigation Fund must be maintained for t= hree years after the plant ceases operation and is decommissioned. Commissi= oner Marc Spitzer said the amendment was prudent considering that the lasti= ng impact of the power project. ""I proposed this amendment to answer the co= ncerns of the pistachio farmers and the irrigation district,"" Commissioner = Marc Spitzer said. ""Although we heard testimony that the power plant's grou= ndwater needs would be less than if the land were farmed, I don't think you=  can be too careful. We're making decisions that could affect an economical= ly depressed area for generations to come."" Other Environmental Conditions:=  Twenty-two conditions were imposed by the Arizona Power Plant and Transmis= sion Line Siting Committee. They include: ? Establishment of a monitoring p= roject and mitigation fund for ground subsidence and earth fissure monitori= ng. Subsidence is a potential side effect of groundwater pumping. Cracks, f= issures or dips can form in the surface of the earth because the water deep=  underground that provided physical support is no longer there. ? Contribut= ions to the Bowie Fire District to enable it to acquire an additional emerg= ency services vehicle as well as funding of emergency response and hazardou= s materials training for firefighters. ? Making arrangements with local law=  enforcement and the Cochise County Sheriff because the project will involv= e an increase in traffic and may result in the need for emergency responses=  by local law enforcement. This was an amendment sponsored by Commissioner = Jim Irvin. ? Prior to construction of the facility, SouthWestern must provi= de the Commission with a technical study showing that sufficient transmissi= on capacity exists to accommodate the output of the plant and the effect of=  its output on reliable operation of the electric grid. ? Conditions requir= ing compliance with air and water quality standards imposed by the Arizona = Department of Environmental Quality and the Arizona Department of Water Res= ources. Additionally, the applicant will have to participate in and comply = with all standards for safe, reliable power delivery. ""I was pleased to sup= port this project, in part because it includes solar technology as a key co= mponent of the whole project. The level of support from the local community=  was also impressive. Les Thompson, Chairman of the Cochise County Board of=  Supervisors indicated that Bowie has one of the highest tax rates of any A= rizona community,"" Chairman Bill Mundell explained. ""The residents and busi= ness people were very excited about the tax and economic development benefi= ts of having the power plant in their community. Additionally, the project = will bring several hundred construction jobs to Bowie and Willcox and, ulti= mately, the 30 or 40 people needed to run the plant."" Commissioner Irvin vo= ted in favor of the project, saying: ""I do believe the need for this projec= t was established in the record. Further, I believe the project is in the p= ublic interest and meets the balancing test."" He was referring to the sitin= g statute that requires the Commission ""to balance, in the broad public int= erest, the need for an adequate, economical and reliable supply of electric=  power with the desire to minimize the effect thereof on the environment an= d ecology of this state.""

"   -----Original Message----- From:  McConnell, Mark   Sent: Monday, March 04, 2002 3:07 PM To: Hyatt, Kevin; Judy and Jim McConnell (E-mail) Subject: New Uniforms for the other Big Red   http://www.journalstar.com/nebraska?story_id=5830&past=  Brace yourselves, Nebraska football fans. The Huskers will feature a different look this coming season.  No, Nebraska isn't switching to a pass-oriented attack.  The Huskers, however, are in the midst of a significant change in uniform style.  Although the details have yet to be finalized, the planned modifications will be the most extreme in several years.  ""It'll be the most significant change since I've been here,"" said Nebraska assistant equipment manager Mike Mason, who has been with the Huskers since 1988.  Said Nebraska Coach Frank Solich: ""There are certainly some noticeable changes, but the players seem to like the idea. And if you look around at pro and college teams, you see some changes.""  In Nebraska's case, Mason said, the most significant modifications will be in its road uniforms. The Huskers will wear white jerseys with a red strip around the collar and a red spandex insert - or gusset - down the sides.  Mason said adidas - which has had a partnership with Nebraska to provide the Huskers with uniforms, shoes, etc., since the mid-1990s - would prefer the Huskers wear white pants with a 4-inch red stripe down the sides for both home and away contests (NU typically wears white pants with red jerseys at home and red pants with white jerseys on the road). But several players, Mason said, have expressed interest in wearing red pants with red jerseys for home games.  ""This isn't over yet,"" Mason said of the decision-making process.  Some Nebraska fans may wince at the thought of a red-on-red combination.  The last time the Huskers trotted onto the field at Memorial Stadium with that color scheme was in November 1986 for a game against nemesis Oklahoma. NU lost 20-17.  The new home jerseys would be red with white piping down both sides of the red spandex insert.  Solich said any remaining changes will probably be minor and will be subject to a vote of the team's Unity Council, made up of representatives from each position.  Examples of the new uniforms are hanging in Nebraska's equipment room near the Husker locker room at Memorial Stadium. Because they're not the final versions, Solich requested they not be photographed.  Solich said adidas representatives approached Husker officials in December about possible alterations, as is the case most every year. Although Solich discussed the changes with his assistant coaches, he mostly left the style decisions to the players, he said.  ""It'll certainly be different, but the colors will still be red and white - there will be no third color - and there will be no change whatsoever in the helmets,"" said Solich, who last season guided Nebraska to an 11-2 record in his fourth season as head coach. ""Some things we just won't mess with.""  Pat Logsdon, Nebraska's director of football operations, likes the new uniforms. ""I think they're nice-looking, and the guys love them,"" she said.  Mason, though, was less enthusiastic.  ""I'm not sure the fans will like it,"" he said. ""I don't necessarily like it.""  Added Solich, ""Some fans don't ever want any change. Some do.""  The planned changes might come as a surprise to some fans, considering the importance Nebraska typically places on tradition. The new uniforms would be a departure from the simplicity in dress exhibited by such storied programs as Penn State, Notre Dame, Oklahoma and Alabama, to name a few.  ""I think the uniforms we had were fine,"" Solich said. ""I think our coaches felt that way, too. But you always want to be open to change, especially if the players feel like they'd like to make a change - as long as it doesn't totally back away from Nebraska's tradition.""

"  Two boys are playing football at a park in Norman, Oklahoma when one of the boys is suddenly attacked by a crazed Rottweiler.  Thinking quickly, the other boy takes a stick and shoves it under the dog's collar, twists it, and breaks the dog's neck, thus saving his friend.    A sports reporter who was strolling by sees the incident and rushes over to interview the boy.  He tells the boy he's going to write the story and says, ""I'll title it 'Young Sooner Fan Saves Friend From Vicious Animal'.""  ""But I'm not a Sooner fan.""  the little hero replies.  ""Sorry, since we're in Norman Oklahoma, I just assumed you were,"" says the reporter and he starts writing again. He asks ""How does 'Cowboy Fan Rescues Friend From Horrific Attack' sound?""

"    Subject: Why did the chicken cross the road?   A new updated version.....   -----  KINDERGARTEN TEACHER: To get to the other side.  PLATO: For the greater good.  ARISTOTLE: It is the nature of chickens to cross roads.  KARL MARX: It was a historical inevitability.  CAPTAIN JAMES T. KIRK: To boldly go where no chicken has gone before.  DR. TIMOTHY LEARY: Because that's the only trip the establishment would let it take.  SADDAM HUSSEIN: This was an unprovoked act of rebellion. We were justified in dropping 50 tons of nerve gas on it.  RONALD REAGAN: I forgot.  HIPPOCRATES: Because of an excess of phlegm in its pancreas.  ANDERSEN CONSULTING: Deregulation of the chicken's side of the road was a threatening dominant market position. The chicken was faced with significant challenges to create and develop the competencies required for the newly competitive market.  Andersen Consulting, in a partnering relationship with the client, helped the chicken by rethinking its physical distribution strategy and implementation processes. Using the Poultry Integration Model(PIM), Andersen helped the chicken use its skills, methodologies, knowledge, capital and experiences to align the chicken's people, processes and technology in support of its overall strategy within a Program Management framework.  Andersen Consulting convened a diverse cross-spectrum of road analysts and best chickens along with Anderson consultants with deep skills in the transportation industry to engage in a two-day itinerary of meetings in order to leverage their personal knowledge capital, both tacit and explicit, and to enable them to synergize with each other in order to achieve the implicit goals of delivering and successfully architecting and implementing an enterprise-wide value framework across the continuum of poultry cross-median processes. The meeting was held in a park-like setting, enabling and creating an impactful environment which was strategically based, industry-focused, and built upon a consistent, clear and unified market message and aligned with the chicken's mission,vision, and core values.  This was conducive towards the creation of a total business integration solution. In summary, Andersen Consulting helped the chicken manage change to become more successful.  LOUIS FARRAKHAN: The road, you see, represents the black man. The chicken crossed the black man in order to trample him and keep him down.  DR. MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR.: I envision a world where all chickens will be free to cross roads without having their motives called into question.  MOSES: And God came down from the Heavens, and He said unto the chicken, ""Thou shalt cross the road."" And the chicken crossed the road, and there was much rejoicing.  FOX MULDER: You saw it cross the road with your own Eyes. How many more chickens have to cross the road before you believe it?  RICHARD NIXON: The chicken did not cross the road. I repeat, the chicken did NOT cross the road.  MACHIAVELLI: The point is that the chicken crossed the road. Who cares why? The end of crossing the road justifies whatever motive there was.  JERRY SEINFELD: Why does anyone cross a road? I mean, why doesn't anyone ever think to ask, ""What the heck was this chicken doing walking around all over the place, anyway?""  SIGMUND FREUD: The fact that you are at all concerned that the chicken crossed the road reveals your underlying sexual insecurity.  BILL GATES: I will soon release the new Chicken Office 2002, which will not only cross roads, but will lay eggs, file your important documents, and balance your checkbook.  OLIVER STONE: The question is not, ""Why did the chicken cross the road? ""Rather, it is, ""Who was crossing the road at the same time, whom we overlooked in our haste to observe the chicken crossing?""  CHARLES DARWIN: Chickens, over great periods of time, have been naturally selected and evolved over time in such a way that they are now genetically endowed with the capabilities required to cross roads.  ALBERT EINSTEIN: Whether the chicken crossed the road or the road moved beneath the chicken depends upon your frame of reference.  BUDDHA: Asking this question denies your own chicken nature.  RALPH WALDO EMERSON: The chicken did not cross the road. It transcended it.  COLONEL SANDERS: I missed one.  BILL CLINTON : I did not, repeat, did not have sexual relations with the chicken.",scott_struble@nas.adp.com,kevin.hyatt@enron.com,you can appreciate this,2002-03-05 12:17:34-08:00,sent

I was wondering if there had been any discussions with either pipeline  about the impact of adding this interconnection. I know that may be a loaded  questions, but based on historic flows, in order to guarantee firm deliveries  from that receipt point, a shipper would have to move its primary receipt point  to the Red Lake interconnection (from say San Juan or East of Thoreau areas on  TW) or negotiate alternate arrangements with the pipelines.

"Following up on our conversation re: Red Lake storage  assuming only a Phoenix lateral gets built off TW, no mainline or SJ expansion:  Capital cost is estimated at $304mm.  A fully subscribed rate on volume of 750,000/d to get a 15% ROR would be $.152/MMBtu (with zero fuel retention).  If we assume a more gradual volume ramping up, beginning with 50% load factor in year 1 climbing to 100% in year 8, the target transport rate would need to be $.248 (closer to my ""top of the head"" $.30 we discussed yesterday).  Both of these scenarios assume 80/20 Debt/equity and a salvage value in year 20 of the project equal to 1/3 of the capital cost.  Also, regarding the Kern River expansion, what might the likelihood be of Mojave receiving Kern gas and backhauling to TW for delivery into Aquila Red Lake?  If the Kern volume of 700,000 (out of 900,000 capacity) doesn't go to Calif end-users, I think Mojave will have a somewhat stranded segment from Cal border to the Kern interconnect.  We could then take this gas and haul it to Phoenix.

"Sun Devil Project   Kern River - Williams announced a definitive agreement to sell it's Kern River pipeline system to Midwest gas and power utility MidAmerican Energy.  The sale includes the 900,000 MMBtu/d expansion project from Opal, WY to Southern California.  Last week, FERC gave Kern a positive preliminary determination on the non-environmental aspects of the expansion.  Now that the project's financing hurdles are apparently overcome, we expect FERC to approve the project shortly and construction will commence.     Assuming Kern delivers 700,000/d of 900,000 capacity into Southern California (200,000 would stay in Utah or Nevada markets), and the only other large California expansion is a 500,000 MMBtu/d lateral to serve Sempra's Baja California power plant, there may be an opportunity for TW to backhaul Opal gas to various Arizona markets.  If a Sun Devil lateral to Phoenix were constructed as a first phase, this could potentially reduce some of the effect of the negative price impact at the California border.         Bowie Power Plant - contact was made with the plant's developers in Arizona this week.  After a positive ACC decision, they are moving quickly to get the necessary air permits.  RW Beck in Denver is the consultant for the plant's fuel requirements.  No determination has been made thus far on where (or how) the gas will reach the plant.   Panda Energy - the confidentiality agreement was executed so Panda will begin sharing projected plant operating data with TW.  Gomez Lateral  Initial review of the line's property easements indicate no obstacles or restrictions in transferring the line to a new owner.

Warren could end up owning a big chunk of WPL when it's over.   kh  -----Original Message----- From: Fawcett, Jeffery [mailto:JFawcett@Sempra.com] Sent: Friday, March 08, 2002 3:12 PM To: Lindberg, Lorraine; 'sslindberg@duke-energy.com'; 'skatz@sempratrading.com'; Huckabee, Phyllis; 'jdasovich@ubswenergy.com'; Hyatt, Kevin; 'mbaldwin@igservices.com' Subject: Kern River deal    Wow ... this is huge!   I've met with executives of Mid-American Energy in the context of doing my Fiber Links business and I didn't come away too terribly impressed.  It's undeniable that Warren Buffet and his chief lieutenant, David Sokol, both have a reputation for finding ways to make money, but this deal seems almost inexplicable when searching for a unique competency of Mid-American that would lead to increased earnings for Kern River.  Any other scuttlebutt about this deal out there in the gas world?    Jeff   p.s.  While at Mojave, Rob Foss and I both worked with Bob Sluder when he was just a gas control/operations puke like the rest of us.  He's apparently done quite well at KRGT.   Williams to sell Kern River for nearly $1B  Beleaguered gas marketer and pipeline operator Williams said Thursday it has agreed  to sell its Kern River Gas Transmission pipeline to MidAmerican Energy Holdings  for nearly $1 billion.  MidAmerican, a unit of investor Warren Buffet's Berkshire Hathaway, will pay  Williams $450 million in cash and assume $510 million of Williams' debt in order to  acquire Kern River. The deal, part of Williams' ongoing effort to strengthen its balance  sheet, is set to close by March 31 assuming regulatory approvals. Williams said selling  the Kern River system will save the company about $1.26 billion in capital expenses  over the next 18 months.  MidAmerican, meanwhile, said it will proceed with a major expansion of the pipeline,  which currently has a capacity of 835,000 Mcf/day and extends 926 miles from Opal,  Wyo., to California's San Joaquin Valley. Built in 1992, it is a key route for shipping Rocky  Mountain gas to markets in the western United States, particularly Southern California.  The expansion project, due to be completed in May 2003, will more than double  the pipeline's capacity to 1.7 Bcf/day, according to a filing Williams submitted to  FERC in August. The value of the pipeline once it is expanded will exceed $2 billion,  MidAmerican said in a release.  ""We are extremely pleased to be acquiring the Kern River Gas Transmission, which  we view as one of the finest natural gas pipeline assets in North America,"" said David  Sokol, MidAmerican's chairman and CEO. Upon completion of the sale, Kern River will  become a subsidiary of MidAmerican. Bob Sluder, senior vice president and general man-ager  of Williams' Kern River and Northwest systems, will become president of the new  MidAmerican subsidiary.  As for Williams, ""We are taking this decisive step to strengthen our balance sheet to  meet the more conservative requirements of the rating agencies, which now require com-panies  like Williams to reduce debt and increase cash flow to maintain an investment-grade  credit rating,"" President and CEO Steve Malcolm said. ""The sale of our Kern River sys-tem  is an important building block in achieving the financial flexibility to expand our busi-nesses  now and in the future.""  Williams has been under pressure from investors and rating agencies since the Tulsa-based  company delayed the release of its 2001 earnings to iron out debt issues related to  the troubled Williams Communications Group subsidiary, which it spun off last year. Ear-lier  this week, Williams said it had reached a deal with investors to refinance $1.4 billion  of WGC-related debt (GD 3/5).  Williams' stock price has taken a beating due to the WGC debt issues as well as the  heightened scrutiny of U.S. energy merchant companies in the wake of Enron's bankrupt-cy  in December (GD 12/4).  In releasing its earnings Thursday, Williams reported a 2001 net loss of $477.7 mil-lion,  or 95?/share, compared with net earnings of $524.3 million or $1.17/share in 2000.  The 2001 loss includes pre-tax charges of $2.05 billion relating to WGC.  WGC said income from continuing operations for 2001 was $835.4 million, compared  with $965.4 million a year earlier. The total WCG-related charges of $2.05 billion repre-sents  80% of the total WCG-related guarantees and payment obligations, and the deferred  payment for services provided to WCG, Williams said.  Also Thursday, Williams said it will raise $275 million through the sale of 9.875% cumu-lative  convertible preferred stock to MEHC Investment, a subsidiary of MidAmerican Energy  Holdings. MEHC will acquire 1.46 million shares of the security at a price of $187.50/share,  with each share of the security convertible into 10 shares of Williams' stock. The deal is expect-ed  to close by March 31 and goes hand in hand with the Kern River transaction.  MidAmerican, headquartered in Des Moines, Iowa, is a privately owned energy  provider with 10,000 employees. It provides gas and power to approximately 5 million  customers.   Jeffery C.

However, as part of the required conversion, Staff recommends that the existing settlement rate structure be maintained and that FT2 FR rate schedule (for a capped amount of small customers) be maintained to protect a very few small customers.

"      Martha Stewart's Tips for Arkansans    GENERAL:  1. Never take a beer to a job interview 2. Always identify people in your yard before shooting at them. 3. It's considered tacky to take a cooler to church. 4. If you have to vacuum the bed, it is time to change the sheets. 5. Even if you're certain that you are included in the will, it is still considered rude to drive the U-Haul to the funeral home.   DINING OUT:  1. When decanting wine from the box, make sure that you tilt the paper cup and pour slowly so as not to ""bruise"" the fruit of the vine. 2. If drinking directly from the bottle, always hold it with your hands.   ENTERTAINING IN YOUR HOME:  1. A centerpiece for the table should never be anything prepared by a taxidermist. 2. Do not allow the dog to eat at the table, no matter how good his manners are.   PERSONAL HYGIENE:  1. While ears need to be cleaned regularly, this is a job that should done in private, using one's OWN truck keys. 2. Even if you live alone, deodorant is not a waste of good money. 3. Use of proper toiletries can only delay bathing for a few days. 4. Dirt and grease under the fingernails is a social no-no, as they tend to detract from a woman's jewelry and alter the taste of finger foods.   DATING (Outside the Family):  1. Always offer to bait your date's hook, especially on the first date. 2. Be assertive, let her know you're interested: ""I've been wanting to go out with you since I read that stuff on the bathroom wall two years ago"". 3. Establish, with her parents what time, she is expected back. Some will say 10:00 PM., others might say ""Monday."" If the latter is the answer, it is the man's responsibility to get her to school on time.   THEATER ETIQUETTE:  1. Crying babies should be taken to the lobby and picked up immediately after the movie has ended. 2. Refrain from talking to characters on the screen. Tests have proven they can't hear you.   WEDDINGS:  1. Livestock, usually, is a poor choice for a wedding gift. 2. Kissing the bride for more than 5 seconds may get you shot. 3. For the groom, at least, rent a tux. A leisure suit with a cummerbund and a clean bowling shirt can create a tacky appearance. 4. Though uncomfortable, say ""yes"" to socks and shoes for that special occasion.   DRIVING ETIQUETTE:  1. Dim your headlights for approaching vehicles, even if the gun is loaded and the deer is in sight. 2. When approaching a four-way stop, the vehicle with the largest tires does not always have the right of way. 3. Never tow another car using panty hose and duct tape. 4. When sending your wife down the road with a gas can, it is impolite to ask her to bring back beer too.

The theory is that drinking beer makes men turn into women.  To test the theory, 100 men were each fed 6 pints of beer within a one-hour period.  It was then observed that 100% of the men gained weight, talked excessively without making sense, became overly emotional, couldn't drive, failed to think rationally, argued over nothing, had to sit down to pee, couldn't perform sexually, and refused to apologize when wrong.

The Staff Recommendation is not yet available.  Summary  As noted in yesterday's email, Staff is recommending the following general principles: -  The Commission convert El Paso's Full Requirements service (FR) to Contract Demand service (CD) - Allocation of CD be based on the greater of (1) a shipper's billing determinants from the 1996 settlement, or (2) coincidental peak (a shipper's own usage) based on demand on Sept. 12, 2001 - The Commission assign specific receipt point rights to shippers based on El Paso's proposed 20 pooling point configuration - A technical conference be convened, that may include attendance by the Commissioners, on the Staff recommendations  Background  Staff recounted the issue on El Paso's system, including the question to be decided by the Commission: has El Paso's FR service become unjust and unreasonable?  Staff believes it has, and explains that it is within the Commission's jurisdiction to allocate El Paso's capacity in order to:       (1) restore system flexibility       (2) end uncertainty (in the form of pro rata capacity cuts) of firm delivery       (3) ensure full & fair utilization of El Paso's system  According to Staff's presentation, the problems on El Paso's system are due to changes in system load since the pipeline's 1996 settlement.  A major increase in CD load and the sale of all unsubscribed capacity since 1996 (which was nearly one half unsold at that time) has changed the operations and capacity availability on El Paso, resulting in frequent capacity constraints on the system.  This problem is aggravated by the settlement's resultant rate freeze, which impedes any economic incentive for El Paso to expand or upgrade its system.  Recommendations (Bob Petrocelli presenting)  Staff recommends that the Commission convert FR to CD, while maintaining (1) the existing rate structure from the 1996 settlement, and 2) a small amount of FT-2 FR contracts (for small customers, such as municipalities), with an overall cap on the rate schedule.  This will ""balance the interests of all shippers and restore firm service on the El Paso system.""  Also, it will send the proper price signals for system expansions.  In comments on this and related proceedings, shippers have recommended four allocation methods for the converted CD:       (1) 1996 settlement bid determinants       (2) system peak (coincidental demand)       (3) individual peak (non-coincidental demand)       (4) some combo of the above  Staff recommends utilizing the greater of #1 or #2 (using Sept. 12, 2001, as benchmark demand day).  This reflects current usage mitigated by the settlement capacity contracts.  Staff also recommends the Commission assign specific receipt point rights, using El Paso's proposed expanded 20 pool system [in this proposal, El Paso narrows its current six pools in three basin areas to 20 geographic pools]. As support of this recommendation, Staff noted:       (1) it is consistent with the Commission's one-time delivery point allocation in BR/Amoco/Topock complaint case       (2) gives certainty for supply to all shippers       (3) enhances the tradeability of capacity       (4) eliminates daily pro rata curtailments in the basin  Commissioners' Discussion  Pat Wood:  He noted that 10-year settlements are far too prospective and will never be approved by him.  Whether the Staff recommendation is the best fix is the question that will be explored in the technical conference. Chairman Wood also asked how the economic incentive to expand will be different -- Staff answered that in 1995 the settlement's intent was to keep the system viable at all, and changes are needed to move to next step. Wood also noted that ""this wouldn't have happened if El Paso had complied with Order 636 -- it's a lesson on the power side that we not carve out exceptions.""  Nora Brownell:  Brownell asked questions about the current infrastructure, how the takeaway capacity at Topock is being handled, and if this addresses future capacity needs.  Staff responded that this is ""an economic fix to the current disincentives for El Paso expansions,"" and that there are proposals out there to address future capacity and takeaway needs.  Bill Massey: Stated that the current situation is ""intolerable"" and that Staff's presentation persuaded him that their plan is reasonable because ""bold Commission action is necessary here.""  Linda Breathitt:  She asked if there are any other interstate pipelines using FR service, and was told no, only some intrastate municipalities still utilize FR on a commodity demand basis.

"Sun Devil Project   Panda Energy - We are analyzing the pro-forma operating information for the plant submitted to us by Panda this week.  Still waiting on pro-forma information from AZ Public Service.   El Paso full requirements / FERC Settlement - FERC staff proposed a settlement that would convert the FR shippers on El Paso to Contract Demand (CD).  The proposed settlement ""will restore some certainty to firm-service obligations while providing incentives for El Paso to add significant increments of new capacity to its system.""  The proposed settlement will now move to a technical conference.  Chairman Pat Wood also said noted the market should not look to see any more 10 year settlements as the period is too long and markets move too quickly.   The impact of the above for Sun Devil is as follows:  FERC is sending price signals to the market and enabling El Paso to expand its system to meet demand (which under the previous settlement, EP was unable to do).  The project that meets the market demand with the best economics will win.   Kern River - The Federal Trade Commission approved the sale of Kern River Pipeline from Williams to MidAmerican Energy.

Richard said if the FERC staff recommendation for F/R is accepted, it will leave SWG in the position of needing a ""substantial"" amount of new transport capacity.  As for Phoenix ROW, they are looking at possibly taking the 8-inch line out of service and conveying it to us for Sun Devil in exchange for transport capacity on the project.  Their ROW varies in  type and width plus some is single use.  If they traded the line segment to us, we could use the existing ROW and just replace the line.

El Paso has two types of firm customers, which are CD (contract demand) and=  FR (full requirements) customers. FR customers are allowed to schedule an = amount up to their full meter capacity as long as capacity is available. Ho= wever, FR customers pay El Paso a fixed reservation charge and  volumes exc= eeding FR quantities are billed El Paso's usage rate. FR customer loads hav= e increased rapidly in the last few years as growth in the states east of C= alifornia has surged. With these increased loads the FR customers have been=  getting a tremendous deal since they pay only the usage charge on incremen= tal volumes exceeding their FR quantities. FR customers argue that they are=  entitled to this benefit since they bargained for it in EL Paso's last rat= e proceeding. El Paso's last settlement was similar to TW's in that custome= rs agreed to certain benefits in exchange for paying higher rates to resolv= e capacity turnback issues. The FR customer's good deal is a problem becaus= e 1) FR customer's increased volumes have led to capacity prorations making=  it more difficult for other shippers to get cheaper San Juan gas, 2) these=  prorations in conjunction with the scheduling cycles make it difficult for=  shippers to get scheduled, 3) El Paso has no financial incentive to expand=  because the FR customers will use the capacity and pay only the usage rate= , and 4) the FR customers ability to take gas has prevented El Paso from of= fering services such as park and loan and storage service that other custom= ers want. Absent FERC action, FR customers will retain the benefits of the = settlement until El Paso's next rate case in 2006.  The Commission is threatening to initiate a Section 5 proceeding to address=  capacity allocation issues on El Paso and has directed Staff to convene a = technical conference next month to address these issues (see March 18, 2002=  Inside FERC).  The conference probably won't occur until at least late Apr= il because El Paso is bogged down in their market abuse proceeding.","blair.lichtenwalter@enron.com, teb.lokey@enron.com, robert.kilmer@enron.com,   eric.gadd@enron.com, steven.harris@enron.com",kevin.hyatt@enron.com,RE: El Paso Full Requirements Customers,2002-03-22 05:56:29-08:00,sent
