First, the good news.  The DPUC issued a final compliance decision (attached)  Thursday approving the ENA prices and removing the draft language that would  have released special contract customers.  The bad news is that we are falling behind in finalizing the agreements with  UI.  Mostly this is due to unavailability of some of the UI personnel.  The  one business issue that is causing a bit of concern on their end is a fear  that they have promised us too much in the way of an option on their nuclear  generation.  In any event, they have already made the commitments in our  binding MOU.  This issue is not a deal breaker but it is contributing to the  delay.  Right now we are scheduled to meet with them in NY Tuesday the 14th  through Thursday the 16th.  As a result, I can not be in Houston on the 15th  as planned.  I am, however, still trying to make it for the 16th.  Perhaps we  can reschedule our meeting sometime on the 16th.  Fallon and I are meeting at  8:30 on the 17th to discuss the project also.

"   From:  Cynthia Sandherr                           01/11/2000 05:16 PM    Rick:  Per your request, please find the one page description of how the  Washington D.C. office prioritizes both human and financial resources while  fitting within the Enron budget process.   I have attached our 1999  activities report which illustrates the process described below.    Congress operates in a two year cycle while the Administration operates in a  four or eight year cycle.  Thus, it is necessary for our prioritization to  focus on the long term.  Within the context of the Congressional and  Administration's Calendars, our office determines and communicates doable  priorities based upon the environment in which we operate.  In addition, we  actively work behind the scenes and commit resources to affect and change  this environment.   On an annual basis, we communicate federal legislative and global  opportunities which we believe affect our operations via briefings to Steve  Kean, who along with our assistance, submits our proposed goals to the Enron  Management Committee,  Global CEO's , individual operating company heads and  heads of key divisions.  Many dialogues and briefings occur resulting in goal  adjustments and additions.  During this dialogue, we advise on possible new  corporate strategies based upon political realities and communicate necessary  resources required in order to achieve the legislative successes.    Once this vetting process is complete (December-January timeframe), and the  Management Committee prioritizes the federal Corporate goals, we submit our  budget and assure this budget directly correlates to the necessary resources  (both human and financial) detailed and allocated to meet these priorities.   (Note:  the budget process usually occurs in the August-October timeframe).   On the financial side, we keep current as to the rates and the expertise  available on the market, as well as, track potential conflicts of interest.    It's our job to know our environment and to lay out strategy.  On an annual  basis, we adjust our resources which can include dropping some issues,  reassigning personnel, hiring or letting go necessary outside counsel, etc.    We remain mindful that in order to achieve legislative success, it is  necessary to follow long-term planning so as to allow for us to build  credibility, keep important political relationships viable and, ultimately,  place us in the best possible political position to achieve success.   Our budget does its best to recognize that the Congressional process can be  unpredictable and that Congress reacts to fast occurring events and public  reaction.   It is rare when we have not foreseen some form of a potential  issue; thus, we always operate within budget.  An example of a contingency  issue would be India setting off a nuclear device, a possibility we had  accounted for yet could not possibly exactly predict nor could we predict the  fall-out and precise Corporate impact.  However,we were still able to budget  for possible permutations for such an occurrence and make adjustments as  needed in order to meet our goals and stay within our budget.  Based upon the  experience of the people in our office, we have been very successful in  anticipating these type of occurrences.  Our report details our 1999 results and projects Enron priorities for 2000  although neither the President's State of the Union address which outlines  the Executive Branch's legislative agenda for 2000 nor the Republican  Congressional response and 2000 Congressional legislative agenda has as of  yet been delivered nor finalized.

Doug headed the Washington office of IBM until he retired a few years  ago, then joined Carla Hills firm and two years ago became Secretary General  of the BIAC. During his Washington service for IBM he headed up the Trade  Committee of the United States Council for International Business to which we  have long been a member.   Doug and I discussed the promotion of energy services and he had several  suggestions which I found to be excellent. He is a top level person who  recommends policy to the OECD. He suggested that he would like to organize a  meeting with you briefing OECD ministers and senior staff on business plans  of today, changes in the market place and what is necessary to advance a  business in today's atmosphere. Doug believes that having such a high level  briefing advances the cause of business and competitive policies which is the  priority of the OECD.  He also called my attention to the OECD Forum 2000 to be held June 26-28 in  Paris. Doug has offered to contact Dennis Lamb, another former Washingtonian  in the diplomatic service who is arranging the program and if you are  available he would ask that you be a primetime speaker. It covers the type of  issues that you addressed at the WTO in Seatlle and the World Economic Forum  in Davos.  (I would dearly love to have a few minutes briefing from you on  your Davos appearances).  I think these presentations at the OECD, one a private luncheon with  Ministers that Doug thinks would be an informal presentation and the  possibility of a slot on the June 26-28 program would be excellent for our  cause and hope that your schedule either in June or later can accommodate  this opportunity.  Joe  PS: Doug and his eco-staff director Ms. Hanne Rosenbaum (she knows and has  worked with John Palmisano) told me that one of their main themes this year  is eco-efficiency which seems to fit our Enron goals.

Let me know if you would like any  additional information, or if would would like me to put this into memo  form.    Argentine law imposes a stamp tax on written contracts.  In the past several  years, the provincial governments of several of the provinces have, in an  effort to raise desperately needed revenues, adopted a new and broader  interpretation of the tax's application.  These provinces--Rio Negro,  Neuquen, and Santa Cruz--have sought to apply this interpretation  retroactively, resulting in the imposition of staggering assessments.  For  TGS, the Enron company (40% owned) most affected, the assessments total $153  million in taxes, $172 million in interest, and $208 million in fines.  (See  attached chart for breakdown).  To date, court challenges to the taxes have been unsuccessful.  TGS has  pending before the Argentine federal Supreme Court an application to declare  the taxes unconstitutional and unlawful, but the Court has, as yet, not  acted.  Meanwhile, the provinces are free to attempt to collect the taxes, by  levy if necessary.    The federal government has, in documents filed in another case, expressed the  view that the imposition of stamp taxes in the manner folowed by the  provinces is illegal.  Energas has also expressed its view that the taxes are  illegal.  The federal Supreme Court, however, has recently denied an  application (filed by another company) to enjoin collection of the taxes.     On November 23, 1999, Enron notified the federal government that it regarded  the imposition of these taxes as in violation of the Bilateral Investment  Treaty between Argentina and the U.S.  Since that notification,  representatives of Enron and the government have held several meetings.   Substantive discussions, however, have not yet begun.  The Treaty mandates a  six-month cooling off period before arbitration can be initiated.  If the  negotiations with the government are unsuccessful, Enron intends to file an  arbitration with the International Center for the Settlement of Investment  Disputes (ICSID) in Washington, D.C.  By way of information, Endesa currently  has an arbitration underway at ICSID challenging the taxes, presumably under  a BIT between Spain or Chile and Argentina.

"Terry was acting with full coordination from Jose.  The problem was this:  Daly insisted someone speak on behalf of the group to the press (and  designated Terry to be the one); Terry did not have the updated information  that we were about to meet with the government officials and deliver a  slightly different message (i.e. that we needed to know if the government  planned to really open Petrobras or not -- the implication being that we  would work within either decision but we needed to know one way or the  other); Terry was simply not in possession of this information and no one had  given it to him (probably because they had no reason to assume that Terry  would be thrust in front of the press); moreover, it's hard to see how Terry  could have taken such a position publicly anyway.  By my eyes Terry did the  best he could and we had an unavoidable communications bust.

The Key message for the trip, in regards to energy, should be:   ""Achieve regional integration, based on the principles of open access,  greater reliance on competition and customer choice rather than regulated  monopolies""  The vision is that a customer in any of the countries will have choices  ""several competing providers""; ""different service options"", and the providers  will have the flexibility and agility to assemble an attractive package by  combining transactions  with other suppliers and customers.  This approach  maximizes the utilization of the existing infrastructure (reduces idle or  redundant facilities) and gives customers the ability to more closely tailor  their energy purchases to the their needs.  There are barriers to achieve this vision. It is in the interest of the  governments to work in a common protocol to progress rapidly.  Development of infrastructure .- Still not well developed. Needs to attract  project financing. At this stage, the customers have few alternatives.  Government policy should be to allow access above and beyond what was  initially contracted to justify the financing. Terms of financing have to be  honored. Long term, competing facilities (pipelines, refineries, transmission  lines, power plants) will be fighting for customers.  Threat. Control of these facilities: Petrobras through the BBPL; YPF in  Argentina   Cross-border Licensing.- Very time consuming, bureaucratic delays to grant,  export, import, re-export permitting.  Present regime cannot accommodate  the  rapid transaction scenario which will be required to support real integration.  Cuiaba Power plant,- As of today we have not received all the permits. Latest  issue is the Bolivian-Argentina border dispute due to YPF denial to  accommodate a transaction of Bolivian gas into Argentina.  Operationally, the plant will receive daily instructions from Brasilia. The  gas supply from Argentina/Bolivia, including spot market transaction  has to  be nominated within 48 hours notice.  There are no mechanisms to change  quickly the approved volumes.  Commercial entities need to be given the opportunity to export/import to  aggregate the requirements of different suppliers various customers.  Taxation.- Transfer taxes (i.e. receipt taxes ,stamp taxes) for each step  down the chain needs to be eliminated for commercial entities, particularly  for export transactions.  These commercial entities buy pieces of the services on behalf of the  ultimate customer (act as their agent) and package the final offer. The  objective to  reduce the cost of the product, which would not be met by  adding a further taxable event. There should not be  more, nor any less taxes  because of the services of the middle company, except for the larger amount  of income taxes generated by increase commercial activity.   Money Transfers.-  Central Bank Controls to authorize the transfer of  currency needs to be made more agile. Currently these procedures are very  time consuming and cumbersome (Brazil -- I am not as familiar with the other  countries)  This is affecting us in Cuiaba. The Central Bank has not approved the gas  contract, specifically the Take-or-pay provision that has a one-year make up  period. They want a longer make-up period, but that was negotiated with YPF  as part of the larger agreement. YPF may agree but at a higher price. The  Central Bank does not want to send US$ out of the country, so they view TOP  as a devise of paying for a commodity never received. So they are meddling in  contract negotiations.    Below are other notes  Thanks  Jose      Terence H Thorn 02/09/2000 09:22 AM To: Jose Bestard/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT cc: Richard Shapiro@EES   Subject: Trade Mission  I have forwarded to you the final schedule of meetings for Daly's trade  mission.  I am very comfortable with issues for Argentina and think we need  to focus mainly on the stamp tax issue.  Secondly, I would raise the issue of  open access pipelines, especially allowing Bolivian gas to flow to  Argentina.  The question I have on this latter issue is whether this is a  matter of changing the law, changing policy or pressuring YPF to allow the  gas to flow on it's section of pipe which I understand is not under the  jurisdiction of Enargas. What can the government do?  JB.- I am not familiar with the genesis of this situation, how these  pipelines escaped the jurisdiction of the regulator.  If it is determined  that they are not part of the regulated pipeline network, in time a bypass  pipeline may be built. But an immediate solution needs to be developed.  In Brazil, I am not sure what to raise.  On Monday we have meetings with the  Minister of Development, Industry and Commerce and the Secretary of Energy  and Mines.  What do I need to have Daly raise with them in private?  Myself  in public? or the Minister of External Affairs?  JB.- For background, the Brazilians have rising concerns of the rising  dollarization of their economy, ""desnacionaliza?ao"". Their concern is not the  US$, it is control. It is that the Old-boys network in Brazil  Government/Industry, has been disturbed by the New-boys taking control of  high visibility sectors, Banking, telecommunications, energy.    Malan, Finance is criticized by the clique that wants the government to be  active in direct investment and support of big projects. Complaints about BNDES (Brazilian development bank) lending to foreigners for  privatization (Recent AES incident) Tourinho, Mines and Energy-- pushing a new privatization model -- sale of  stock at the market, not sale of control to a given company. This allows the  existing management to stay in place.  If it is the Secretary of Energy, Carraro, his big mission is to coordinate  the developement of emergengy thermal plants. Big Picture Governement Porgram  -- Petrobras provides that gas;  Eletrobras buys and remarkets the electric  energy;  BNDES provides the financing  --- All within the family.  Foreign companies will not play by the rules of the old network. Enron has  been actively complaining about the gas policy under Petrobras control.  The One Issue I would raise is the lack of competition in the gas sector.  Petrobras control of the BBPL and national gas. There cannot be true  competition in the energy sector because the marginal power plants, price  setters, gas power plants.  As a note, there was a commitment with the World Bank to sell the part of 51%  control of the Brazilian part of the BBPL pipeline. What Petrobras is doing  is locking-up the capacity long term, and building a second pipeline.   Of equal importance is our meeting with the Sao Paulo Governor.  What issues  do we have or what do you want me to say to him regarding our assets in this  area.  Even if it's to compliment on something, that's fine.  JB.- The State of Sao Paulo, Mario Covas team are to be congratulated by the  skillful manner that they have conducted the gradual privatization of energy  sector.  Covas is very influential. His current battle deals with tax reforms  in Brazil. He is fighting a system of tax-preferences in other states to  attract industries, which ultimately creates a Federal burden and  consequently a Sao Paulo burden.  The Petrobras control issue of the gas sector should have resonance.  I assume we have no key issues in Chile at this time.    JB.- There may be some but I a blissfully unaware of them. I would be  interested on what you pick up  Thanks.    ---------------------- Forwarded by Jose Bestard/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT on  02/15/2000 01:45 PM ---------------------------   Denise M Macedo 02/15/2000 06:50 AM To: Jose Bestard/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT, James M  Bannantine/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT, Diomedes  Christodoulou/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT cc:    Subject: Gazeta Mercantil - Terry Thorn  Hi guys,  1.

O executivo norte-americano lembra que a ?decis?o do governo brasileiro de estabelecer um pre?o ?nico para o g?s ?natural em todo o pa?s , um claro exemplo de medidas que devem ter seus dias ?contados. 'Ficamos confusos ao saber de tal decis?o'. Terrence Thorn acredita ?que um monop?lio estatal pode ser negativo . concorrncia e que a  privatiza??o  da Petrobras ter? que ocorrer um dia. Para ele, o processo de privatiza??o de energia no Brasil vem sendo conduzido  de forma eficaz, 'mas o Pa?s ainda n?o concluiu o projeto de desregulamenta??o  (liberalizar o pre?o do g?s natural, por exemplo) e h? muito trabalho pela  frente'. Segundo Thorn, as empresas estrangeiras de energia podem oferecer  servi?os  inovadores para o setor. 'O problema , que o mercado n?o est? preparado'. Ele defende que as novas  fases da desregulamenta??o do setor energ,tico no Pa?s sejam debatidas por  toda  a sociedade. O interesse dos norte-americanos pelo setor p""de ser visto na pr?pria  composi??o da miss?o de empres?rios ao Brasil. Das 20 empresas que viajaram  com  Daley, dez eram do setor de energia.

"Rick,  Aside from what you already know on the Enron de Mexico ENA regulatory and  commercial front (in documents that I gave you), I am also supporting  HydroMod and EBS in their efforts to materialize business oportunities in  Mexico.  Attached you will find activity reports on these matters.  Enron de Mexico has also taken an active  role in the Bufete Industrial deal  with EE&CC although I do not have anything to do with that.  Nevertheless, I  should say that the One Enron approach is at work in the Mexico City office.    Apparently very soon EBS is going to sublet some space in our MX City office  and get someone on the ground permanently.

What impact would such a description of ""energy services"" have in a country where the government retains a monopoly over the ownership and provision of energy?  ""The United States welcomes and supports the efforts of countries that are privatizing and deregulating their energy and energy services sectors.  It believes such actions are in all parties' economic interests.  However, as part of WTO negotiations on energy services, we seek neither to require governments to privatize ownership of energy resources or the provision of energy or to break up existing monopolies.  Our goals are market access commitments and a regulatory framework that ensure that energy services firms are able to compete with all suppliers in the provision of energy services on a fair, non-discriminatory basis, under a timely, transparent and independent regulatory framework, including access to transmission and distribution networks.  We want to ensure that where monopolies exist, that they do not abuse that position.""

Per Jim's request for the database.  (I don't know if you want to put the= =20 values that Kevin is giving into the database). =20   (1)  Completed the negotiations and FERC filing of the Next Hour Market=20 scheduling proposal.  When implemented, scheduled for June 2000, this will= =20 provide one stop shopping for next hour business.  Ties OASIS and TAGGING= =20 together into one request.  Also if a tranmission provider cuts the=20 transmission the PSE only pays for his actual use versus what he originally= =20 scheduled. This will speed up the ability to schedule the next hour=20 non-firm.  This order is an important recognition by FERC that its OATT did= =20 not cover hourly, which we complained about alot at FERC's hotline last=20 summer.   2)  Successful in obtaining the release of all ISN (system information) to= =20 marketers in the WSCC region.  This was an individual effort by Dick that h= as=20 been benificial for our traders in the WEST.  Successfully prevented the WS= CC=20 Operating Committee from taking action that would have reversed this effort= . =20   3)  Assisted in getting the initial control areas in SERC approved last ye= ar=20 and preventing ATC changes this year and OC changes that would have negated= =20 the Control Area effort.   4)  Dick served as Co CHAIR of the ISO committee that put the SPP contract= =20 in place that eliminated MW mile pricing in SPP and will serve as the basis= =20 for SPP's RTO.  =20   5) Dick was appointed to the NERC Control Area Task Force which was formed= =20 as a result of our the success of the Enron Control Areas in TVA and have s= o=20 far been successful in keeping this effort so that it is non punitive.  Thi= s=20 has turned into a very positive process that may result in a new=20 configuration of the NERC relibiability effort.   (6) Dick's made comments to ENTERGY that helped push Entergy into filing= =20 their new scheduling procedure (ultimate source and sink) with FERC.  This= =20 was initially going to be implemented unilaterally March 1 without a FERC= =20 filing and Enron would have been forced into an after the fact complaint=20 situation at FERC where we are not allowed to get damages that we would hav= e=20 incurred in the meantime (See Comm. Massey's concurrence in Aquila v. Enter= gy=20 about the lack of incentive to file complaints).  Kevin Presto said that=20 winning the protest at FERC (due 4/12) would be worth $100 MM.   (7)  On 2/2, TECO revised its proposed generator imbalance charge from=20 minute by minute to hourly accountability (notably, TECO revised its propos= al=20 before FERC issued an order based on the EPSA protest herein.) We worked wi= th=20 EPSA to file an EPSA protest to TECO=01,s proposal.  We didn=01,t like TECO= 's=20 proposal but had commercial concerns about filing a protest in our own name= =20 (since Enron is working with TECO on a project).   We were able to get EPSA= =20 to protest this issue in TECO's initial filing.  Enron is planning to site= =20 generation in Florida, but we don't have the value on this win yet.               (8)  FERC issued a NOPR on January 28 proposing to revise the= =20 way it assesses annual charges to public utilities.  Enron, along with=20 several other participants (Dynegy, Koch, APX, Citizens, NP Energy, Sonat a= nd=20 Williams), filed a petition for rulemaking with FERC in August, 1998,=20 requesting FERC to revise its methodology for assessing annual charges,=20 arguing that FERC's current system of assessing annual charges on sales for= =20 resale of power discourages trading, impedes reliance on competitive market= s=20 for power, and could create competitive advantages for utilities over new= =20 power marketers entering the market.  We proposed that FERC either assess i= ts=20 costs on transmission only, or reallocate the amounts that it collects=20 through sales transactions versus transmission transactions.  Although FERC= =20 does not grant our petition and in fact dismisses it as moot, the petition= =20 served its purpose.  In the NOPR, FERC notes that because most of its time is spent on=20 transmission issues (a point that we made in the Petition), it is appropria= te=20 to assess costs only on the MWh of electric energy transmitted in interstat= e=20 commerce by public utilities.  Under the current assessment system, FERC=20 divides its costs between transmission and sales.  Now FERC is proposing to= =20 collect its costs solely through transmission.  FERC justifies this change= =20 because it spends most of its time on transmission issues, and because=20 transmission providers can collect the fees through transmission charges=20 assessed to users of the grid.  FERC proposes to asses its costs to 1)=20 unbundled wholesale transmission; 2) unbundled retail transmission; and 3)= =20 bundled wholesale power sales.  Bundled native load transactions will=20 apparently avoid assessments of any FERC-related costs; however, EPSA and= =20 Enron are protesting this issue at FERC.  (Jim Steffes has been working on = a=20 calculation of additional value.)   (9)  Interconnection Policy =01) Utilizing EPSA efforts, including Sarah's= =20 meeting with FERC, we got the policy statement we urged FERC to put forth (= in=20 the forum we suggested, i.e., an existing proceeding) in the Tennessee Powe= r=20 order where FERC said interconnection procedures should follow the pro form= a=20 tariff, including that a generator doesn't have to request transmission and= =20 interconnection at the same time.  We worked with EPSA to draft the ""Model""= =20 interconnection agreement that EPSA filed at FERC in the Entergy=20 interconnection proposal.   (10)  AEP/CSW order =01) approved the merger but accepted intervenors=01,= =20 testimony showing market power and conditioned merger on an independent=20 calculation of ATC postings (which we proposed) and independent market=20 monitor soon after the merger occurs with RTO participation by 12/15/01. = =20 Kevin Presto said the independent ATC calculation is worth $20 MM to Enron.=  =20 (Note: we are going to propose MAIN instead of SPP, which AEP chose.).  Kev= in=20 said that AEP's ATC calculation can trump all interfaces in ECAR, so this h= as=20 a positive effect not just on AEP, but on all of ECAR.   (11) MAPP =01) FERC further order on refunds.  MAPP refused to refund moni= es=20 that it was unable to collect from a non-jurisdictional member transmission= =20 owner, NPPD.  EPMI filed a protest to MAPP=01,s refund report, arguing that=  MAPP=20 was ordered to make full refunds and it violated that order.  FERC agreed= =20 with Enron and rejected MAPP=01,s refund report.  FERC said MAPP must refun= d the=20 full amount to transmission customers, whether or not it was able to collec= t=20 that money from NPPD.  Results in another $50,000 of refunds for EPMI.

He said that when he spoke to Jade at the end of last week about her investigation, she said that her recommendation had gone up the line to the front office, that she did not need any additional information and that unless her superiors wanted additional information, that she did not expect to need anything more from us.   I think this means that Jade will likely just let the 30 day waiting period expire unless someone up the line from her raises questions or issues (which it doesn't seem as if she expects).  Furthering this interpretation is that fact that, according to Brian, Jade is out of the office this week, so it would be difficult for her to begin drafting a second request.   Brian said he is supposed to talk to Jade on a conference call later today about another matter, and he will see if she will provide any more definitive information.

(This deal I believe was struck in the context of various other issues  pending among the legislature, governor and municipal league).  Late  yesterday, Senate Leader DeGrow came out in support of an amendment to  exclude schools (elementary, secondary, community colleges, universities,  etc...) from the local franchise for purposes of aggregation -- thus  upsetting the status quo which had been agreed to by the Governor and  Municipal League.  Senator DeGrow was firm in his support and said that in  order for the Senate to agree to House changes, this language had to be  added.  Well, the language was not added in the House --- due to overall  confusion.  So, we are going to talk with Senator DeGrow this morning to urge  him to go forward with the Senate agreeing to the House changes in the bill  and to consider the schools amendment in the context of exempting all  Alternative Electric Suppliers from local franchise requirements.  A bill or  amendment to this effect can be handled during the September session.   Customer groups are also going to do the same thing.  The Govenror supports  our position on this issue and we believe we have the momentum to get this  done when the legislature comes back in September.    Roy and I are available today if you have any questions.  You can reach Roy  at 630-654-6472. I can be reached this morning at 614-306-4359 and this  afternoon at 614-760-7472.

"Update:  Senator Phil Gramm placed a hold on the S. 2071 late, late last  evening in order to preserve his options to serve on the Conference with a  broader House bill version.  The Senate should go out for the July 4th recess  this evening so consideration of this bill on the Senate floor will be  deferred until their return the week of July 10th.  Senators Gramm and  Schumer also intend to introduce their electricity restructuring bill this  evening.

Thus, this bill is likely to  be passed by the  Senate and referred to the House under unanimous consent late this evening or  tomorrow at the latest.  This provides a Conference vehicle with the House.   Senator Gramm intends to hold his PUHCA bill from Senate floor consideration  until the House acts.  During the week of July 10th, the House plans full Commerce Committee mark-up  of H.R. 2944, the Subcommittee passed bill, with the exception of striking  the section 101 Transmission language and replacing it with something along  the lines of the Chairman Bliley's transmission draft sent to you last  Friday.  As you recall, Enron opposes the H.R. 2944 Section 101 transmission  language but supports the Bliley draft language.  Thus, this is a positive  development.  Drafting continues with Subcommittee Chairman Barton willing to  accept the Bliley transmission language provided he gains some flexibility in  terms of a state grievance body and some additional means for state rate  setting influence.  Perhaps a directed rulemaking would address his concerns.   We are deeply involved in the lobbying and drafting of this agreement and  hope to have late tomorrow a copy of a Bliley/Barton letter sent to all their  Committee members confirming the agreement to work together to pass  legislation this year.

ADRD legal counsel has apparently discussed this with the  Registrar of Regulations and it is not expected that there will be any  problem.  Larry may have to have a discussion on Monday morning directly with  the Registrar to answer questions respecting why this is necessary and what  it needs to be done on an expedited basis.  Apparently, even expedited it  will take a week for the registration process such that the ADRD intends to  send a notice to all bidders on Monday that it has received approval for the  PPAs to be registered as a regulation and that such registration will not  likely be effective after the PPA auction has commenced.   2) He has spoken with the Executive Director of the AEUB, Bob Heggie, who has  indicated that he intends to recommend to the Chairman of the AEUB on Monday  morning that the AEUB issue an AEUB Order accepting the 26  errata/clarifications identified by PWC on June 2000 and the subsequent  errata/clarifications that have been identified since.  Apparently PWC will  have this letter done on Monday and I expect it will include the FRDT and  PRDT issue. I believe all of the following outstanding errata/clarifications have now  been addressed to Enron's satisfaction:  (a) NPV in the RBPA; (b) parasitic load (c) change in law - more profitable (d) clarification of FCR (e) FRDT and PRDT (Article C7).

Duke Energy Offers Governor Davis Solutions to California's Power Supply  Shortfall        Committing to Deliver 3,000 Megawatts of New Supply to California                And a Five-Year Fixed Price Supply Contract      HOUSTON AND MOSS LANDING, Calif., July 31 /PRNewswire/ -- Duke Energy North America (DENA) today offered to California Governor Gray Davis specific solutions to address the state's electricity supply shortage proposing to deliver 3,000 megawatts of new supply through the construction of generation facilities.  In addition, DENA proposed a five-year, fixed-price supply contract to incumbent utilities to address the immediate concern with volatile electricity prices.     ""California's high electricity prices during peak-demand periods result from insufficient supply to meet the demand,"" said Jim Donnell, president and chief executive officer of DENA.  ""In the past ten years, no significant new power generation facilities have been built in California.  During the same period, peak demand has risen more than 10,000 megawatts.  This combination has caused the state's reserve margin to fall to less than 2 percent, which necessarily results in higher prices and abnormal volatility.""     Under current procedures, it takes in excess of four years to deliver new power generation in California.  To add substantial incremental generating capacity to California, DENA proposed Governor Davis use his existing authority under the California Emergency Services Act to streamline the permitting process to facilitate the rapid construction of environmentally friendly generation by 2001.  DENA also asked the governor to use his current authority to allow California utilities to enter into bilateral contracts with energy providers, so they could better manage their exposure to high energy prices.     To help solve the state's supply shortfall, DENA said it remained committed to adding substantial generation in California.  Within two months and upon receiving final regulatory approvals, the company will begin construction on 1,000 megawatts at its Moss Landing facility.  The expansion of the current 1,478-megawatt facility will be in commercial operation by summer 2002.  And, with an expedited permitting process, DENA could deploy its available resources to construct an additional 500 megawatts for commercial operation in 2001 and 1,500 megawatts for 2002.     To address the concern associated with the high energy prices experienced this year, DENA offered to provide up to 2,000 megawatts of electricity to the incumbent utilities at $50 per megawatt-hour for a five-year period beginning Sept. 1, 2000.  This would mitigate the exposure to price spikes, for a reasonable time period during which additional generation resources can be built.     ""DENA is committed to help bring electricity price stability for the citizens of California through these proposals,"" Donnell said.  ""We are confident that our expertise in building and operating power generation facilities can help resolve the supply crisis.""

The overriding  consideration should be to give OPIC operating flexibility to work with us in  accomplishing our financing objectives without a lot of scrutiny from others  around Washington that might be interested in getting political benefit from  putting OPIC's political management on the hot seat.  We will be meeting with  OPIC shortly after the announcement to set out the reasons why nothing much  has changed. Our objective I think around Washington should be to quietly  inform our friends and other critical players so that no one is surprised by  learning of the shift and no one considers it to be a big deal.  So I would  propose that after meeting with OPIC we make the rounds and talk to our  contacts at State, DOE, Treasury, the Executive Directors at the World Bank  and the IDB, EXIM and the other agencies as well as the appropriate staffers  on the Hill that might have cause to comment on OPIC's decisions.  In each  case we should be laying out the arguments why this transaction makes sense  and why in the end nothing much has changed.  Hope this helps.

Therefore, could  I prevail on you to provide me with a list of the names and titles of those  from the aforementioned groups who we should consider sending a letter to  inform them of the transaction.  I assume it would be the U.S. Executive  Director, of World Bank and IDB, plus OPIC President.  You know better than  me, so I'll stand by.  Your input will be included in a workbook we are  developing for a major communications rollout plan--both internal and  external.

"Rick,   As I understand it, you wanted our wish list of what we would like (within  the confines of Enron).  Here's my wish list:  1.  The business units within Enron are very segmented and that can prevent  the cross-pollination of solutions for customers.  For example, if we could  put together a program that linked commodity sales for a variety of customer  sizes of load with load control devices and the offering of curtailable  products, it would create a mechanism to 1) provide savings/income to  customers during peak periods, 2)make power available to Enron during peak  periods for resale and 3) help modulate the potential for outages and  insufficient capacity.   The packaging of other energy efficiency services  could also be considered in conjunction with this.  2. Coupled with and also apart from suggestion #1 above, Enron should  increase its marketing of renewable products.  By doing so it would 1)work in  hand with a curtailable program, by freeing up generation during a hot peak  day - if photovoltaics are used, 2)enhance Enron's image in the community,  3)serve a market niche.  3.  Have the opportunity to add two more wishes.  4. Coupled with and apart from suggestions #1 and 2 above, Enron should focus  more on distributed generation alternatives which can 1) provide significant  savings to customers since in many states stranded costs are not assessed on  DG, 2) can be used as a source of energy during a peak period by paying the  customer a premium to curtail and make the power available to Enron to sell  on the market 3) help offset the problem of delivering power into a  constrained control area where there is dg power we can tap into.  5. Create a forum within government affairs to collectively brainstorm and  develop strategies to implement the needs of Enron's business units.  Clear  identification of the goals and problem solving not only provide good  solutions through the contribution of diverse viewpoints, but it is also an  excellent learning experience for all participants as a clearer understanding  of the goals emerge.  Also, participants can take with them a better  understanding of what may be achievable, while others may  pick up ideas that  can be reshaped and used in their jurisdictions.    I hope this is in line with what you were looking for.  If not, please let me  know and I'll ask for three more wishes.

He called on FERC to expedite their investigation of the market and to provide for consumer rebates if FERC cannot conclude that California prices are ""just and reasonable.""  Below are my notes from the press conference.  Attached is the Governor's press release.  Karen Edson  Notes from Gov. Davis=01, Press Conference:   Opening Statement Record hot temperatures; lack of supply; price manipulation have created th= e crisis. Electricity is the life blood of the State's economy. He (the Governor) has responded with several recent steps. Among them is his request that the AG & FERC examine price manipulation  1st Point He is calling on the CPUC to establish a price stability rate for consumers and business. His intent is to reduce rates to $55-$65/mo. for next year or two.  (This point was unclear.  Did he mean rates, bills, or what?) Customers need predictable, reliable, affordable rates  2nd Point The Governor called on President Clinton and Chairman Hoecker to expedite a= n investigation of the unconscionable rates being charged by out-of-state generators to California utilities The Governor wants FERC to make evidentiary findings that rates are just an= d reasonable.  If FERC can=01,t make such findings, he wants them to require consumer rebates.  (This portion of his comments is not reflected in the attached press release.  It is taken right from the script of Senator Steve Peace.)  3rd Point Believes deregulation will work. Generators must be held responsible.  When gouging and extorting; you must pay the price.

"Rick:  unfortunately, the stand alone reliability legislation DOES have a  ""reasonable chance of passing.""  To block this possibility, we are pursuing  two strategies simultaneously.  #1 the Stakeholder letter with the message  that the bill does little for reliability and provides no real political  inoculation so should not be passed; and #2 the lack of consensus on the  technical language contained within the bill makes passage problematic.  If  the bill were to be able to move, the bill must be considered ""consensus""  otherwise it  will pose political problems for the Calendar.  Today, there is  still lack of bill consensus.  We should consider a strategy of asking for  reasonable legislative provisions beyond the current language which would  improve the bill (and continue to keep true consensus from occurring.)  Of  course, we cannot be obvious on this approach.    Part of the reason I was pushing to get one or our CEO's to play golf with  Congressman Tauzin on the 22nd is he is the key Member pushing the House  Leadership to pass the stand-alone bill now to ""politically inoculate  Republicans.""  As the likely new House Commerce Committee Chairman; he  carries sway.  Another approach would be for us to call Entergy to give  Congressman Tauzin the same message.

Lee said that  senior-level negotiations led by Secretary Summers were initiated last week  between the CFTC and SEC and that progress was being made on the single stock  futures issue (the major issue postponing movement of the legislation).    As you know, the House completed committee work on HR 4541 before it  recessed.  The bill will now is pending before the Rules Committee where  differences will be worked out between the three different Committee versions  (Agriculture, Commerce, and Banking).  The Senate Agriculture Committee  passed out the Senate version in July.  However, the bill is not moving  quickly in the Senate due to Senator Phil Gramm's desire to see significant  changes made to the legislation (not directly related to our energy  language). Last week at the Republican Convention, I asked the Senator about  the bill and he said they were working on it, but much needs to be changed  for his support.  More telling perhaps, were Wendy Gramm's comments that she  would rather the current bill die if a better bill can be passed next year.   What this means is that we must, at the least, remove Senator Gramm's  opposition to the bill to move the process and more importantly seek to gain  his support of the legislation.  Lee Sachs message was just that.  I told Lee that we shared his desire to  move the legislation as long as it contains a full exclusion for all  non-agriculture commodities (including metals).  He said that we would have a  difficult time defending the metals provision politically. But, Lee said  ""we  would not find Treasury opposition to the House Commerce Committee language""  (which includes favourable language on energy and metals).   This is a  positive development, because it isolates the CFTC from its key defenders and  I hope ensures no veto threat on our issues.  However, I do not expect  Treasury to be vocal in support of our position.  It is clear that  Congressional leaders and the Administration want to get this bill done this  year and there remains a good opportunity for enactment.  However, with less than 20 or so legislative days left, we need Senator Gramm  to engage.  A call from Ken Lay in the next two weeks to Senator Gramm could  be an impetus for Gramm to move his staff to resolve the differences.  Gramm  needs to fully understand how helpful the bill is to Enron.  Let me know your  thoughts on this approach.   I am prepared to assist in coordinating the call  and drafting the talking points for a Ken Lay/Sen. Gramm call.

"Congressman DeLay is with us.....but with the demise of Speaker Gingrich, the  role of Committee Chairman has been reinstated.  Thus, this to-be Chairman is  going straight to the Speaker which poses both a political and House Rules  conundrum.  Of course, we are also going to the Speaker, the Majority Leader,  etc.  But it becomes the ""pet rock"" game where one Member respects another  Member's ""pet rock"" so that Member respects his ""pet rock.""  The one  outstanding pressure point we retain is lame-duck Chairman Bliley who is on  our side yet his relationship with the Leadership is poor while Congressman  Tauzin's remains stellar.  You might recall that Congressman Tauzin switched  parties with the price tag being many bennies and ""secret deals"" from  Leadership.  As of today, Congressman Barton is also on our side (but with  the death of his brother, his mother's open heart surgery, his wife's breast  cancer scare, etc.) we have not gotten him to refocus on approaching  Congressman Tauzin yet.

"As the individual responsible within Enron Corp. for coordinating the  analysis of regulatory transfer restriction issues in the above-referenced  project, I wanted to give each of you a brief update, but more importantly,  ask for your help in ensuring, as we move closer to the signing date, that we  are fully coordinated on these issues and are prepared to act in a consistent  and coordinated fashion across the regions as quickly as possible.  Over the last several weeks, the regional general counsel offices, V&E (Bill  Weiland), Skadden and myself have been talking to local counsel across the  regions to make sure that we fully understand all of the regulatory transfer  issues and that we also fully understand the implications of the regulatory  transfer restrictions in the context of the ""ABC"" deal structure.  We have  now largely completed that process and the conclusions reached during that  process have been memorialized in various documents, including the ""ABC  Matrix"" that many, if not all of you, have seen.  All that is remaining is  confirmation on a South Korean competition agency issue and the completion of  the analysis relative to the Wind assets in Europe regarding EU competition  agency issues. Those two items should be completed by early next week.  We  have also recently begun the process of preparing documents that will be  necessary for the approval of the transfer of Elektro in Brazil...which  brings me to the second issue, coordination and preparation.  Having reached a critical juncture with the completition of virtually all of  the regulatory analysis, the next step is to plan for the announcement of the  transaction...more specifically, ensuring that regulatory/governmental  communication assignments for both pre and post announcement are fully agreed  upon and understood by all... and that the process of drafting the necessary  requests for regulatory approval documents is agreed upon and begun as soon  as possible.  To ensure that this all happens in a timely manner and with  quality, I would like to request that one individual from each operating  region and company be assigned as the point person so that I can have a  single individual within each operating unit to go to that has the authority  to put together the comprehensive regulatory transfer plan and the  responsibility for assuring the execution of the plan, both during the  periods of time leading up to signing and announcement and during the  transition period leading up to closing.  I would respectfully ask that the  names of these individuals be communicated to me by close of business  Wednesday, August 16, 2000 to provide us sufficient time to address the work  that lies before us.

"  Ginger , please circulate this list rather than the earlier  one.                               TOP 10 PRIORITIES                                     1.  Alberta Power Purchase Agreements -  If Enron Canada is  successful in the PPA auction, Enron Canada will have a very long position in  the Alberta wholesale market; continued risk mitigation efforts, advocacy of   good transmission and distribution tariffs,  and development of rules for  Plan ""B"" ( for those units that received no bids) will be  critical.                                   2.  Continued support for   ongoing commercial transactions other than the PPAs and help in  identification of where commercial opportunities are. (An example of the  latter, work  with commercial people to analyze how recent initiative re  transmission tariff and wholesale market design in Ontario enhance  opportunities for ""Power by the Hour"" and other distributed generation  projects.)                              3. Ontario Electricity Market Opening  - work to avoid further delay in market opening and advise on the development  of procedures and practices for the new market. (As an example of the latter,  working with traders in Toronto and Houston to understand mechanisms for  interregional trade and transmission rights, and the commercial   opportunities that exist.)                                  4. Enhancement of  wholesale market design in Alberta and Ontario.                               5. Assist Enron Canada and EES Canada  in better understanding rules  applicable   to wholesale and retail transactions in Ontario and  Alberta.                     6. Alberta Natrural Gas  Unbundling.                                  7. Renewed focus on potential  for restructuring of power markets in British Columbia in the event that the  New Democrats (socialists) are defeated and replaced  by a Liberal   (pro-business) government in the province.                                 RECOMMENDATIONS TO MAKE GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS MORE  EFFECTIVE                                              1. Encourage  government affairs staff based outside of Houston to make periodic visits to  Houston to meet with Houston based group and to meet with commercial groups  in Houston. (In our case this would include  Calgary).                               2. Replace or supplement the large  group meetings with smaller meetings/seminars in which smaller groups can  focus on issues of particular interest or enhance their understanding of a  particular issue.  Seminars would be more in depth than what is possible in  current group meeting format.                        3. Continue to enhance  the information retrieval system so it  is easier to locate useful material  (i.e. submissions, filings, etc.).                        4. Continue to  emphasize to the commercial group  (at all levels) the value to Enron of   involving  government affairs in every major transaction  (value enhancing,  risk mitigating) -  this should become the practice rather than the  exception.

However, if the experience in  overseas deregulating electricity markets where price increases and spikes  have occurred is any precedent, we will need to have some more down-to-earth  responses to a some of the potentially inflammatory issues facing the  politicians:     1. When the prices spike, who reaps the windfall? Who sells that most  expensive 1% of the kwh? Is it a careful planner or a lucky speculator or  market manipulator? Someone is making a bunch of money off the screwed up  system. Who is it, and why is that OK?     2. We do not allow people to inflate water prices to consumers in times  of drought, or food prices in times of hurricanes or floods. Even gasoline  price increases in periods of high demand are within 20%-30% of the base, not  2,5,10 or 100 times the average like spot electric prices. The issue isn't  whether the system is broken or not or how bad partial regulation is or how  much demand has increased versus supply. Thes will be seen as ""ivory tower""  discussions. The populist political issue is, until the problem is fixed, why  should some shrewd big electric company or middleman be allowed to profit off  the misfortune of consumers who did not cause the problem? Why should anyone  be allowed to profiteer by selling at multiples above their generation cost?     3. The hedges, fixed price contracts and other de facto insurance against  volatility that Enron or others offer could be seen as a symptom of the  problem rather than the solution.  Enron could be seen as at best a band aid  and at worst an opportunist made possible only by a broken system - - -sort  of like the guys who ran the old style protection rackets, or Colombian  ""security consultants"" who ""guard "" pipelines from the threats their guerilla  afiliates create, or  political risk insurance that you shouldn't really need  if the host country wasn't so screwed up. Don't worry about high crime in  your neighborhood -  - - just hire an off-duty policeman.   Who needed these  new electricity risk management products in the old days before deregulation?       We have to be able to answer these types of questions at the level of the  ordinary citizen, not merely have the correct long-term competitive market  solution, or the forces of ignorance and re-regulation will gain momentum.  Are we sure we shouldn't back a temporary peak hour price cap  until the  regulatory problems we're all familiar with are worked out, to avoid a much  worse long term rollback?. - - -DLH    Steven J Kean@EES 08/14/2000 05:42 PM Sent by: Maureen McVicker@EES To: Executive Committee cc: Gavin Dillingham/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT, Joseph P  Hirl/AP/ENRON@ENRON, Jeannie Mandelker/HOU/ECT@ECT, Nicholas  O'Day/AP/Enron@Enron, Mark Schroeder/LON/ECT@ECT, Richard  Shapiro/HOU/EES@EES, James D Steffes/HOU/EES@EES   Subject: Talking Points re ""reregulation"" in California  As I promised this morning at the executive committee meeting, below are some  talking points for your use.  Overall message:  the market is working, regulation is not.  In California, peak demand rose by 10% over the last 4 years while new  capacity grew by only 2%.  But, as you would expect, the market responded by  proposing 8,000MW of new generation - - more than enough to offset the peak  demand growth.  The regulatory process, at both the state and local level,  has failed to site this new generation.  The problem is regulation, not  deregulation.  When San Diego customers began experiencing the effects of higher prices,  Enron responded with a fixed price which would have shielded San Diego  customers from price volatility and provided prices below their current  summer levels (Enron's price was about $55/MWH).  After publication of  Enron's offer, nine other companies made offers.  Again, the market responded  where regulation failed.  San Diego has not accepted any of these offers  because of regulatory/legislative restrictions on its ability to buy outside  of the PX (i.e. the spot market).  In markets where siting is easier, suppliers have moved to build additional  generation.  Enron built 3 plants in response to the 1998 price spikes.   Those plants were planned, sited and built in less that 12 months - - in time  for the summer of 1999.  Where regulatory hurdles are lower, the market  responds.  The solution to current pricing and reliability issues is more competition  not reregulation.  Policy makers should:  Open the transmission grid so that power can get from where it is to where it  is needed.  Expedite interconnection of new generation.  Expedite siting of new facilities.  Give customers a choice, so that they have better access to demand side  solutions.   Also attached is a more detailed discussion of California, prepared by Jeff  Dasovich of our San Francisco office.

"I have forwarded separately GA top 10 goals for EES.  While there will be  need for refinement and additional discussion, I would like to see us start  now to develop strategies for these goals.  Below I've suggested people in  our organization who could serve as ""issue leaders""  who could take on the  task of more fully defining the goal, developing the strategy, and developing  the metric by which performance is measured.  I would work with these people  and do whatever necessary to coordinate, direct, etc.   Are you ok with this approach and with the designated leads?  (Suggested  leads are shown on the last page)  I think many of these goals are also good  categories to state previous results.    For example, one of the goals we should move on quickly (which you have  mentioned to me) and which is listed as #10 is the ""improve communication"".   We could do this initially through the monthly newsletter and perhaps a  client survey which measures EES Mgmt.'s satisfaction with GA.  I would think  and like if someone with some PR pizazz could take these and run with them.   The newsletter should look professional and, I think, be a joint publication  with EES (which I've talked to Peggy Mahoney about). It would be great if the  first edition could be out in a couple ow weeks.  All of the other goals pretty much have a similar story - some immediate need  which needs a lot of attention.

"Robert Michaels is proposing a consultant study looking at the California  electricity chaos (see attached).  It is roughly a $100,000 study before  printing and distribution costs with a delivery date of December 1.  The  study would also involve Ken Malloy's Center for the Advancement of Energy  Markets.  I think Robert would do a good job but raise these issues:  1) This is expensive.  It is at consultant rates and is not an academic study  where a think tank can get the professors to do something at less cost  2) Malloy is pretty heavy into this at a cost of $14,400 of about 40% of  Michaels.  His NARUC connections are very important, and we would want him on  the popularization side, but this is too much.  3) The study might need a co-author with lots of academic credibility to join  Robert as good as he is.  I'm glad that we have this proposal--it will force us to think about what we  want, who does it, and how it should be distributed.  We should also think  about how much industry money we could gather to fund such an effort (it  should be large given the stakes).

Ellen Wolf (of Tabors  Caramanis) and I created this presentation building on previous presentations  by Tim Belden and Dave Parquet.  In the presentation and the meeting we made  the following points: There isn't much FERC can do because the cause of the price spikes is not in  the wholesale market.  We discouraged FERC from taking any action that would  hurt the vibrant wholesale market in the California and the rest of the West  as well. High prices logically resulted from scarcity and if the Commission does  anything it should (1) investigate whether market power was being exercised  by any party and, (2) if necessary to protect the market (while still  incenting needed generation) establish a price cap at a scarcity rent level  equal to the price at which loads were willing to interrupt.   The IOUs have not properly prepared for the risk of high prices caused by  scarcity.  They have failed to hedge and have underscheduled their load,  therefore having to fill a large percentage of their load at ISO real time  prices.  My analogy was that this was like day trading your retirement fund  as an asset allocation scheme. The market would function better if more information was provided to the  market. The Commission should do whatever it can to incent participation by load. To see the presentation, detach, save, and view in Powerpoint.  When you do,  you will find there are many ""hidden"" slides that were not part of the oral  presentation but were provided to Staff in hard copy for additional  information.  According to the head of the investigation (Scott Miller), the staff got alot  more out of this meeting than Staff's previous meetings with the IOUs and the  generators.  Based on the numerous phone calls I've been getting, the Staff  is looking into the data we provided.    I have also attached a revised version of the presentation that Tim sent to  Scott Miller on Friday.  Tim's version conveys the same message but takes a  different approach to conveying the message.  On Friday, Tim talked to Scott  and answered some additional questions.  Tim said that Enron is in favor of  eliminating the mandatory PX buying requirement and would like the IOUs to be  able to buy from Enron Online.  He also explained more fully the existence of  scarcity .     ",steven.kean@enron.com,richard.shapiro@enron.com,FERC Presentation on California/West Wholesale Market,2000-09-01 03:54:00-07:00,sent

The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.  ?  ? SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) - Legislation meant to ease the burden of power rate  spikes in Southern California and help avert future energy shortages in the  state were signed into law Wednesday by Gov. Gray Davis.  One measure spreads energy price increases over several years, and the other  speeds the approval process for new power plants. Davis deferred action on a  third, politically delicate bill, which would use taxpayer money to defray  the costs of rate increases in excess of 10 percent.  ?   ""This is not the last step we have to take to solve this problem, but it's a  very important first step,"" the Democrat said.  Opponents said the governor was approving merely a stop-gap solution for the  state's energy crisis.  ""It is a quick political fix that puts on layaway today's high energy costs  until 2003 or 2004,"" said Doug Kline, a spokesman for San Diego Gas and  Electric. ""The law is designed to get the politicians past the next  election.""  Both measures would take effect immediately if they receive endorsement from  the Public Utilities Commission, which meets Thursday, the governor's office  said.  San Diego residents have seen their electric bills soar since rates were  deregulated in June. Deregulation was meant to lower prices, but demand for  electricity has outstripped supply because of a growing population, a booming  high-tech economy, and less power available from neighboring states that  haven't deregulated.  The utility commission last month cut rates for most San Diego residents by  43 percent in response to outcry over rising prices.  Under the first measure, rates for residential users would be capped at 6.5  cents per kilowatt hour, dropping the average monthly residential utility  bill from $120 to $68. Customers would receive rebates for energy use for  which they were charged more than 6.5 cents per kilowatt hour after June 1.  The measure seeks to avert causing San Diego Gas and Electric losses, but the  company said customers would face rate hikes in 2003 or 2004 to make up for  projected losses of $839 million stemming from the new law.

Greg Clarking reports on how to get better rates using the Internet. Greg Clarking reporting: Helene Baldizzone, a New York City artist, was growing increasingly concerned about rising electricity costs, so she signed up with start-up electricity retailer SmartEnergy.com. Helene Baldizzone (SmartEnergy.com Customer):  I thought, OK, well, let's try somebody else because the bills had been going up little by little every month with ConEdison.  So I thought, well, I have nothing to lose at this point. Clarking:  Baldizzone is happy with SmartEnergy where she has locked in a rate of 8.3 cents per kilowatt hour.  She was paying as much as 13.3 cents per kilowatt hour before switching.  SmartEnergy says its goal is to let consumers take advantage of the sometimes confusing options created by deregulation of the energy industry. Gautam Chandra (President/CEO, SmartEnergy.com):  What we are doing is taking that confusion away by being the agents for the customer in terms of looking at the best prices, locking in the best prices for them. Clarking:  SmartEnergy, currently available in New York City, will be available in all twenty-four deregulated states within the next few months. There are a number of electricity suppliers in each of the deregulated states and consumers can save a lot of money by doing a little research. Rick Cowles (Energyland.com):  Don't sit back and just hang in there and wait and see what's going to happen a year or two down the road because you're going to find that electric rates have definitely changed in a year or two and it may not be to your advantage. Clarking:  To find out what energy options are available in your area, you can call your state's public utility commission or click on to Energyland.com for a complete list of energy suppliers and their rates. Cowles:  Right now, consumers are kind of in a unique position where they do have the ability to go in and see some immediate savings. Baldizzone:  It's easy.  But I like especially saving the money.  It's better in my pocket. Clarking:  That's Your Money.

Energy Is Hot By Christopher Edmonds  Special to TheStreet.com 9/20/00 12:47 PM ET  URL: http://www.thestreet.com/comment/christopheredmonds/1088836.html HOUSTON -- Up and to the right.  That could be the theme of the eighth annual Dain Rauscher Wessels energy  conference this week in America's self-proclaimed oil capital. Between the  whispers in the hallways and the bullish presentations from an overflowing  barrel of oil, gas and power companies, you might think you were in the  corridors of some Silicon Valley conference of yesteryear.  But, no, this is all about energy, and energy is hot. With oil hanging around  $37 per barrel and natural gas solidly above $5 per million BTU, oil, gas and  power stocks have caught fire. To illustrate, take a look at the chart of the  Philadelphia Stock Exchange Oil Service Sector Index, or OSX:   Up and to the right. And, a great deal of the price gain is rational. As the  price of the commodities increases, profits follow. That should mean positive  earnings from a plethora of oil and gas companies.  While new Securities and Exchange Commission regulations have stifled the  more explicit (now illicit) preannouncements at conferences like this,  regulations can't cap all the enthusiasm from rising commodity prices. For  example, Kenneth Lay, chairman of energy powerhouse Enron (ENE:NYSE), said at  the conference he is very comfortable with analysts' estimates, hinting the  numbers are conservative. ""We should meet or exceed analysts' expectations  for the quarter and the year.""  Others followed suit. Bradley Fischer, president of CMS Energy Oil and Gas  (CMS:NYSE), (profiled here earlier ), said his company will post ""record  production and record income this year,"" because the fundamentals of the oil  and gas business are as good as they have been in his career. ""I've been in  this business 28 years. The first 10 were good and the last 18 have been  difficult. Now, I'm looking for the good times to roll.""  And this from Diana Naylor, senior vice president at independent power  producer Calpine (CPN:NYSE), when reacting to analysts' estimates in the  coming year. ""We look to be making that number and look to increase that  [guidance on earnings] shortly.""  Even the oil drillers and equipment companies are celebrating. Nabors  Industries (NBR:AMEX), owner of the largest land-drilling fleet, thinks  analysts are significantly underestimating its potential. Dain Rauscher  estimates Nabors will earn 83 cents per share this year and $1.65 next year  -- numbers Chairman and CEO Eugene Isenberg called conservative. He presented  calculations suggesting the company could earn $3.27 in the middle of the oil  cycle and has the ability to earn $6.81 in the coming years. ""The probability  of this happening is very high,"" he said.  All because of $37 per barrel oil and $5 gas? While there is little question  that third- and fourth-quarter earnings should be strong, there is growing  concern that the oil and gas stock rally has been overdone. Not only have  stocks tracked the rise in commodity prices but the once-beleaguered sector  has also seen earnings multiples expand significantly.  That is a warning sign to at least one analyst. While the going is good, the  rapid price rise isn't sustainable. Oil stocks stocks ""will peak in the next  several weeks and trade sideways, probably for the rest of the year,"" said  Jim Wicklund, head of energy research at Dain Rauscher, adding that there may  be added selling pressure as funds try to lock in gains before the end of the  year. ""Stock [price pressure] will also be impacted by portfolio managers'  bonus structure.""  And Wicklund warned that what he sees as the inevitable moderation in oil  prices will put pressure on the stocks into the new year. ""Right or wrong,  stock prices are slaves to commodity prices.""  If Wicklund is correct, the next move could be down and to the left.  The Peoples Court One of the clever and unique features of the Dain Rauscher Wessels energy  conference is the annual investor poll. This year, nearly 400 investors  responded to the on-site survey and, while the results aren't scientific,  they are likely instructive.  Power to the People - Investors Speak Dain Rauscher Wessels Energy Conference Survey Results Prediction for price of oil (per barrel) on 12/31/2000$32.70 Prediction for price of oil (per barrel) on 12/31/200127.70 Average price of oil in 200128.80 Price of Natural Gas (per MM BTU)  on 12/31/20005.50 Price of Natural Gas (per MM BTU)  on 12/31/20014.60 Closing Price of Oil Stock Index  (OSX) on 12/31/2000137.90 Closing Price of Oil Stock Index  (OSX) on 12/31/2001147.00 Will the OSX outperform the S&P 500 in 2000Yes - 93.7%, No - 6.3% Will the OSX outperform the  S&P 500 in 2001Yes - 67.7%, No - 32.3%  Favorite Merger PartnersChevron with Texaco, Unocal  or Phillips - 35% Top Energy Stocks for the Next YearKey Energy, ExxonMobil, Enron  Presidential Straw PollBush 53%, Gore 47% Source: Dain Rauscher Wessels Investors see oil prices moderating a little between now and December and  further into next year. However, survey participants do not see the same  pattern for natural gas, with estimates for gas prices remaining well above  $4.50 through next year.  And what may at first appear to be good news for George W. Bush probably  isn't. A six-point lead looks nice, but remember -- we're on his home turf,  Texas, among his brethren in the oil business.

They are not rate-based, and have no guaranteed return paid for=20 directly by retail customers (except perhaps to the extent that a utility= =20 signs a deal to purchase capacity and/or energy from the merchant.)  Plus, = I=20 think the utilities are incentivized under the current vertically integrate= d=20 structure to benefit their own merchant plants or their utility plants (les= s=20 supply).  ? TENNESSEE POWER ORDER ON INTERCONNECTION POLICY -- FERC issued an order o= n=20 3/15/00 clearly expressing its policy on interconnection issues.  The order= =20 is significant because it was issued in large part due to the lobbying=20 efforts of EPMI and other generator members through Enron's membership in t= he=20 Electric Power Supply Association (""EPSA""). =20  In mid-January, EPSA arranged all-day meetings for Sarah Novosel (Enron) an= d=20 other EPSA members to meet with the FERC Commissioners and staff to discuss= =20 interconnection issues.  Fourteen EPSA member-companies were represented at= =20 these meetings, and we expressed to the Commissioners and FERC staff the=20 problems we are facing in our efforts to successfully negotiate=20 interconnection agreements with utilities.  We urged the Commission to, at = a=20 minimum, develop procedures that will make requesting and negotiating=20 interconnection agreements less time consuming and more even-handed.  The= =20 Commission had assumed that the procedures laid out in the pro forma tariff= =20 for requesting transmission service also applied to requests for=20 interconnection, and they were surprised to learn that most utilities do no= t=20 abide by the procedures for interconnection requests. =20  In the Tenn. Power order (that dealt with a complaint filed by Tennessee=20 Power Co. against Central Illinois, which FERC dismissed), FERC clarifies= =20 that the pro forma tariff procedures established for transmission requests= =20 apply equally to interconnection requests.  Furthermore, FERC states that a= =20 utility may not require a generator to submit a request for transmission=20 service along with its request for interconnection service, stating that=20 these are separate services and should be treated separately by the utility= . =20 (Many generators have found that utilities are requiring them to submit=20 transmission requests at the time they submit interconnection requests, and= =20 then the utility insists on performing costly and time-consuming system=20 impact studies for the transmission service, even if the generator does not= =20 want the transmission service).  By applying the pro forma tariff procedure= s=20 to interconnection requests and by requiring utilities to accept=20 interconnection requests without transmission service requests, FERC is=20 eliminating many of the roadblocks currently encountered by generators in= =20 attempting to obtain interconnection from utilities.  FERC also states that= =20 if the parties to an interconnection agreement fail to agree on the rates,= =20 terms or conditions of the interconnection, the transmission customer may= =20 direct the utility to file within 30 days an unexecuted agreement with FERC= . =20 FERC will then have 60 days to determine the just and reasonable rates, ter= ms=20 and conditions for the interconnection service. =20  During the FERC agenda meeting on 3/15, Commissioner Massey was very please= d=20 with the order and congratulated his colleagues on providing the industry= =20 with needed guidance.  Commissioner Massey then encouraged utilities to eac= h=20 develop their own standard interconnection agreement that applies to all=20 generators requesting interconnection service, and he also encouraged the= =20 industry to work together to develop an industry-wide pro forma=20 interconnection agreement.  EPMI has been working with EPSA on a pro forma= =20 interconnection agreement, so Commissioner Massey's comments could encourag= e=20 the utility sector to begin negotiating an industry-wide standardized=20 agreement.  However, even without a standardized agreement, we hoped that= =20 FERC's order will help remove many of the obstacles currently used by=20 utilities to delay (sometimes indefinitely) the citing of new generation.  ? TECO HOURLY IMBALANCE FILING -- TECO made a FERC filing to require minute= =20 by minute balancing for generators that interconnect to the transmission=20 system.  EPMI protested through EPSA and asked for hourly balancing.  Befor= e=20 an order was issued (somewhat unprecedented behavior before FERC), TECO=20 withdrew its minute filing and refiled for hourly imbalance calculations. = =20  At this time, FERC has not accepted requests by EPSA and others to create = a=20 ""standard"" generator imbalance schedule for the OATT.  FERC has said it wou= ld=20 review the filings on a case by case basis.  FERC has not required utilitie= s=20 to file imbalance schedules -- it ""encourages"" them to do so.  At this time= ,=20 only Entergy, SOCO, TECO and several other utilities have filed imbalance= =20 provisions as amendments to their OATTs.  Most utilities require this to be= =20 ""negotiated"" (not much room for negotiation) in the interconnection=20 agreements.  While FERC requires interconnection agreements to be filed at FERC and the= y=20 can be filed ""unsigned,"" and then protested, this can be an impractical=20 solution when building a peaker in less than one year, such as Enron has=20 done.  A merchant power producer is more likely to move the project to a mo= re=20 friendly utility forum or accept some provisions that may be somewhat onero= us=20 in order to site and build the plant for summer start dates.  ? ENTERGY INTERCONNECTION FILING =01) On 3/1/00, Entergy filed a proposed= =20 interconnection policy and procedure at FERC.  EPMI protested various aspec= ts=20 and we assisted EPSA on its protest.  Before the order was issued (again=20 fairly unprecedented), Entergy agreed to make certain changes to its propos= ed=20 interconnection procedure and interconnection agreement in response to=20 protests.  (Entergy asked FERC to delay an order until it could make this= =20 filing.)=20  Entergy agreed to change:  Defines ""required"" system upgrades as those required to simply interconnect= . =20 (EPMI and EPSA issue).  (""Required"" are those such as resulting from the=20 Short Circuit/Breaker Rating Analysis and Transient Stability Analysis--lik= e=20 circuit breakers, relaying devices, system protection equipment.)  Customers are not required to supply reactive power except when ""in service= ""=20 (did not go as far as EPMI argued -- that we should not be required to=20 provide it or should receive the cost of our liquidated damages if we have = to=20 cut our deal.  Entergy said it will pass through amounts it receives.)  Adopted EPMI's proposed ""Emergency"" language that loss of Entergy's=20 generation and inability to meet its load requirements is not an Emergency.  Agreed that Entergy cannot interrupt generator for ""non-emergencies"" except= =20 when ""complying with reliability protocols or procedures established by NER= C=20 or SERC or reg. agency (EPMI issue).  Changed force majeure language to match OATT.  Entergy also states that it will not include generators in Short=20 Circuit/Breaker Analysis and Transient Stability Analysis until an=20 interconnection agreement is signed, although the generation projects will= =20 remain in the queue.  This can cause the costs to vary from the 1st estimat= e=20 to time of actual interconnection.  On 5/18/00, FERC issued an order accepting Entergy's pro forma=20 interconnection agreement (""IA"") and procedures subject to modification.  A= s=20 I mentioned above, Entergy had adopted some of EPMI's suggestion (in EPMI's= =20 comments), including limiting emergencies to not include Entergy's loss of= =20 generation.  All transmission must be separately arranged through OASIS -- it is not=20 included with an interconnection request. Entergy's interconnection policy will apply to generators that will serve= =20 wholesale, as well as unbundled retail. Dismisses EPSA's call for a ""model"" and approves Entergy's pro forma=20 interconnection agreement, subject to modification.((The Commission stated= =20 ""EPSA, Dynegy, and PG&E argue that the Commission should initiate a generic= =20 proceeding or industry collaborative to address interconnection=20 concerns....The Commission declines at this time to issue a policy statemen= t=20 or convene a industry collarboration to establish standardized IPs=20 (Interconnection Procedures) and IAs (Interconnection Agreements).  With=20 respect to IPs, the Commission's recent findings in Tenn. Power amplify the= =20 Commission's findings in Order No. 888, which established standard procedur= es=20 for obtaining transmission service.  It is our belief that no additional=20 standardized procedures are necessary at this time.  We do, however,=20 encourage utilities to do as Entergy has done here and revise their OATTs t= o=20 include procedures for requesting interconnection services and the criteria= =20 for evaluating those requests.  Because an RTO will administer its pro form= a=20 tariff, it is our hope that compliance with our RTO rulemaking will elimina= te=20 concerns about interconnection procedures."" at p. 10.) Agreed with EPMI that billing disputes should be placed in escrow, not paid= =20 to Entergy subject to refund (FERC said that the IA should conform to other= =20 aspects of the Order No. 888 tariff--for example, Entergy and customer are= =20 responsible for their own negligence). Holds that all other terms of the Order No. 888 pro forma tariff apply to t= he=20 IA, even if  the IA does not repeat all those provisions. Clarifies Tenn. Power case that if a generator connects first and another= =20 generator subsequently connects in the same local area and the grid cannot= =20 accommodate ""receipt"" of power without expansion, the new generator must pa= y=20 costs of expansion. Entergy is required to revise IA to make distinction as to which provisions= =20 are pure ""interconnection"" and which are applicable when=20 transmission/delivery is also requested (on OASIS). Entergy is required to attempt to complete the interconnection studies in a= =20 specific timeline (60 days for 1st iteration --system impact), and to provi= de=20 a statement that Entergy will notify applicant of any delay with an=20 explanation for the delay (Entergy had included no timelines). If applicant and Entergy cannot agree on IA terms, Entergy must file the=20 unexecuted agreement at FERC for FERC to decide. Approves Entergy's credits for ""optional"" upgrades (required to transport= =20 power away from the plant), but requires Entergy to file an explanation of= =20 how the credits work. Entergy will only include prior queued interconnection requests in subseque= nt=20 studies once they have signed an interconnection agreement (to show more=20 intent to actually complete the project).  This does not mean that failure = to=20 execute an IA results in removal from the queue, just that the generator ma= y=20 be subject to different actual interconnection costs when it connects.  Thi= s=20 is a risk that FERC says is inherent in interconnection.  Entergy will also= =20 post its queue on OASIS. Reactive power must only be supplied when generator is operating. Per EPMI=01,s comments, Entergy cannot keep the initial $10,000 deposit, un= less=20 actual costs are $10,000 or greater (generator must pay actual costs of=20 studies). Per EPMI's comments, Entergy must pay for energy taken during an emergency= =20 (or explain why that is inappropriate). Per EPMI's comments, Entergy must explain the requirement that the generato= r=20 pays for subsequent changes to Entergy's transmission system.   ComEd Interconnection procedures -- On 3/6/00, ComEd filed interconnection= =20 procedures.  Enron's comments were included in EPSA's protest on the=20 following issues. Proposed procedures:  1.  Submit valid request to interconnect (include # of generating units,=20 proposed max MW capacity and MVA, specific location, operational date).  Da= te=20 and time of receipt by ComEd establishes queue position.  This info will be= =20 posted on OASIS within 15 days (without listing the applicant's name).  2.  Within 30 days of the request, LOI will be tendered.  Applicant has 30= =20 days to respond or lose queue position.  LOI authorizes commencement of=20 engineering work.  3.  Within 45 days of LOI, ComEd will perform an Interconnection Study with=  a=20 project diagram.  Study assumes interconnection of all ""competing"" requests= =20 (that ask for a location that affects your interconnection costs) that have= =20 prior queue dates.  4.  Within 30 of receiving the interconnection study, Applicant must decide= =20 whether to proceed.  5.  After Applicant decides to proceed, Applicant may have a maximum of 90= =20 days for a ROFR against lower priority requests and to begin negotiating an= =20 Interconnection Agreement.  Although somewhat unclear, if there is a=20 ""competing"" request, Applicant must exercise its ROFR within 15 days by=20 notifying ComEd of the desire to begin negotiating an interconnection=20 agreement.  If Applicant doesn't negotiate an IA-- lose queue spot.  6.  Once IA negotiations begin, Applicant has 90 days to execute it (or=20 submit dispute to arbitration).  7.  Before ComEd does inititates construction or installation of facilities= ,=20 IA must be executed.  (if generator is to come on line in < 1 year, ComEd= =20 will negotiate an agreement (with appropriate financial safeguards) to=20 proceed before execution of the IA.)  8.  ComEd will include ""reasonable milestones"" that must be met in order to= =20 maintain queue position.  My specific comments for comment:  Some items are unclear.  (1) Whether the ""Decision"" to proceed is made in= =20 writing (which it should be); (2) The entire ROFR procedure (does it become=  a=20 race to see who executes an IA faster?) The 90 day IA execution period is now inconsistent with FERC's new statemen= t=20 in Tenn. Power  (30 days). If ComEd won't start work until after the IA is executed, then the 30 days= =20 needs to be adhered to (otherwise, the timetable seems too long before work= =20 begins). Milestones need to be specified (the current proposal contains ""may"" includ= e=20 milestones, and ""may"" include the following...)  Also, ComEd wants to=20 ""reasonably extend"" the milestones.  This must be done on a=20 non-discriminatory basis. ComEd allows itself 45 days to complete the Interconnection Study and this= =20 can be extended in ComEd's ""sole judgment.""  I disagree and think it should= =20 only be extended if ComEd provides a reasonable explanation to FERC (simila= r=20 to the pro forma procedures now in section 19.3 re: system impact studies).  On 4/26/00, FERC issued an order that again declined to initiate a generic= =20 interconnection proceeding, but ""encouraged"" utilities to revise OATTs to= =20 include interconnection procedures.  FERC also stated that the timelines in= =20 the OATT for transmission system impact studies (60 days) and facilities=20 studies (60 days) are applicable to interconnection studies and that ComEd = is=20 required to provide an explanation for any delays past these deadlines.  FE= RC=20 required ComEd to change some other procedures identified by the EPSA prote= st.   ? FERC ORDER ON AEP=01,S INTERCONNECTION POLICY =01) On 6/29, FERC issued a= n order=20 on AEP's proposed interconnection procedures.  EPMI participated in comment= s=20 through EPSA.  While FERC largely reiterated its recent orders on Tenn Powe= r=20 and Entergy interconnection procedure, there are several items of interest:  AEP said that it had a backlog of interconnection requests and needed more= =20 than 60 days to complete the System Impact Study.  FERC held that AEP must= =20 commit to completing the SIS within 60 days (consistent with the pro forma= =20 tariff), but if AEP determines it needs more than 60 days, it is required t= o=20 notify the customer with the reasons for the delay.  FERC further stated, ""= We=20 expect AEP to dedicate sufficient resources to these interconnection reques= ts=20 to eliminate its backlog.""  FERC rejected AEP's proposal to only provide transmission credits for ""firm= ""=20 transmission (to a customer that is required to pay for system upgrades). = =20 FERC said credits must apply to firm PTP, non-firm PTP, or network.  Allows AEP discretion on hiring third party contractors (since AEP would ha= ve=20 to spend time educating the third party contractors); however, FERC=20 reiterates that AEP must eliminate its backlog.   ? SPP Interconnection procedures  -- In 7/00, SPP filed clarifications to i= ts=20 interconnection procedures recently filed at FERC.  EPMI participated in=20 EPSA's protest that the System Impact Study should be completed in 60 days= =20 (or SPP should provide an explanation for the delay), instead of the 90 day= s=20 requested by SPP.  SPP has agreed to this change (which is also consistent= =20 with FERC's recent order on AEP's interconnection procedures.)  Also, it=20 appeared that SPP wanted the Interconnection Agreement to be executed withi= n=20 15 days, which is close to physically impossible, especially when SPP has n= o=20 pro forma IA.  SPP agreed to 60 days.   CP&L interconnection procedures -- Most recently, CP&L filed interconnecti= on=20 procedures that ask for a 90 day study period despite the FERC orders in AE= P=20 and SPP stating that the deadlines are 60 days.  EPSA protested with yet=20 another appeal to FERC to standardize these procedures.  FERC has not issue= d=20 an order. =20   The lack of standardized procedures has become problematic in just the few= =20 months since Entergy's procedures were filed.  We are required to constantl= y=20 monitor the notices for any procedures that have been filed, then check eac= h=20 one carefully to determine how it deviates from the Commission's orders in= =20 other cases.  The utilities are not required to point this out in their=20 filings (ie, no redlining from an OATT, which is required in transmission= =20 OATT changes.)

My lack of enthusiasm for our WTO  initiative, I know, has hardly been masked, but, frankly, what is contained  in the incoming letter, below, I find quite disconcerting.  I have argued  that in our key markets, e.g., Europe, Japan, etc. (I am assuming we do not  need it in the USA, even today) the WTO initiative, i.e., liberalisation of  energy siervices, would be of little value by the time it was implemented.  I  had, apparently mistakenly, at least assumed that liberalisation of energy  siervices at a minimum meant third-party access to transmission networks.  If  not, then what the heck are we doing in this fight.  BUT, as you will see  from the incoming, below, when Paul Hennemeyer, of my team here in London,  joined Joe and Bob Fisher in Geneva to do a presentation on liberalisation of  energy services in WTO, it provoked a letter, to which Joe responded, saying  that the US Energy Services Coalition has NEVER taken a position on thrid  party access, and it is doubtful they could agree to such a position (Joe  agreed, and said this was just an Enron company position!).  You can probably  guess my position on this, but I thought I would forward this to you for your  information, and, if warranted, follow up, as the conversations we have had  have never led me to believe that either of you thought we were pursuing a  WTO initiative which did NOT involve third party access.   thanks  mcs   ---------------------- Forwarded by Mark Schroeder/LON/ECT on 24/10/2000  16:03 --------------------------- From: Tom Briggs@ENRON on 24/10/2000 06:49 CST To: Mark Schroeder/LON/ECT@ECT, Paul Hennemeyer/LON/ECT@ECT cc:    Subject: RE: Energy Services  Mark and Paul:   It seems that Paul's enthustastic and brilliant presentation  may have upset a few people.

I am confident that the WTO representatives were better informed and enlightened by the presentations given by the ESC. I am sure they were also struck, as was I, by Paul's enthusiastic explanation of the range of innovative energy services offered by Enron. What sparked my concern was the reference to access to energy networks.  Personally, I do not and, more importantly, nor does OGP take a position on TPA in the EU, to which you refer in your communication. Even more so in the context of the WTO, because it has never been discussed. I surmise though, that other ESC members would have similar  reservations. My concerns were heightened by questions on the subject raised by one or two of our interlocutors. This part of the discussion then broadened somewhat and included information about a court case in Germany to overcome entrenched opposition to TPA by certain network operator(s). I know not whom.  I believe it would be a pity if the broader aspects of energy services, supported generally by the ESC became subsumed by a debate on TPA , to either nationally or privately owned networks, to which some WTO governments outside Europe and the United States, maybe opposed.  While I detected concerns about this in the questions asked, I don't think that the baby was thrown away with the bath-water. It is my view, however, that the ESC should be cautious about raising an issue which some governments  may perceive to be outside what they think is a more reasonable agenda, and to which, rightly or wrongly, they have antipathy.  My concern is that this may then  be used to forestall  the worthy and, perhaps, more achievable objectives of  the ESC to include  the wide range of services advocated, in the main, by Paul and by the others who presented.  I  most certainly have a positive view on the value of your work and I hope this helps.  I am not sure at this point whether I will be available to join you in London but I am planning to attend the  conference on November 27 and I look forward to meeting you and Bob once again.

From your response regarding the comment in Geneva, I am not feeling that I  addressed the specifics of your concern so at the risk of prolonging the  pain I'll make another stab at a response. If the concern centers on  liberalization of transmission access for electricity and natural gas, I  would respond that we want to see the EU electricity and natural gas  directives fully implemented. The EU had asked member countries to fully  implement transmission access and it is being accomplished in a phased in  approach. Some member countries are doing it in a way that makes energy  services possible, some to a less degree and so far, France has not adopted  the implementing legislation which is a subject of concern to the EU.   The opening up of markets to the maximum degree possible is a broad goal of  the Energy Services Coalition recognizing that this is a position that has  to be negotiated. We have not recommended any specific regulatory system or  regime.   If I am still missing your concern, please bear with me and bring me in  closer to any concern that you may have.

"I think paul has a number of good suggestions here.  I think that tying  rankings to clear objectives does not reflect the fluidity of our charge,  though, and will lead to expectations which may not be met.  I also feel  strongly that the ranking needs to be a relative one -- I would go to a pure  number system.  We are going to need to assess at each PRC whether the  organization is strong (in which case I think it's ok to have a  disproportionate number of high ratings) or whether the organization has  weaknesses that force us to grade tougher.  You don't get that in an absolute  system with preset expectations.  I think your group in particular has done a  good job of emphasizing team work ( and punishing those who don't play well)  so we need not create a competitive or jockeying environment so long as that  emphasis is communicated explicitly.  I agree with Paul's points about giving clear, specific feed back (though I  don't think we can give a clear target for what one must accomplish to be  superior).  I also like the idea of the abbreviated mid year PRC to deal with  those we need to counsel more vigorously.  I'm not sure we can get away with  it but I am willing to give it a shot.  I think Paul is to be complimented for taking time to focus on the larger  organizational issues .... very vice presidential of him... no overstepping  of bounds ... quite the contrary.

I  worked with Mark this year on CEA reform but   I had not originally listed him since our dealings were on an issue not  assigned to me yet referred to me in my colleague's absence.    Rick, I understand system mistakes occur but I remain concerned that I am  being singled out and that I received no prior notification of changed  policy.

In my first attempt to input them in the system, I  hesitated including you for the simple reason that I'm certain you have  countless other reviews to do already, and, frankly, I feel that you're an  integral part of my review whether you're formally on the list or not.  When  I went back to make my final additions to the list, the systerm was already  closed--Paul had approved the first round, which I guess shuts it down.    It's likely not appropriate for reviews to happen outside the system, but I  wanted to let you know that, from my perspective, it would be great to  receive from you.  I'd value it a lot.  And I think we've worked closely  enough together over the last year for you to have a basis for reviewing me.   But again, I'm of the view that irrespective of the list, you partake in my  review of necessity, and I don't want to add any additional burdens to an  already loaded schedule.

IEP will be stressing the importance of the contracts as part of the solution for next summer. Several IEP members have offered (and have continued to offer) long-term fixed contracts at terms under the current retail rate freeze.  We will indicate that the utilities have been hesitant to enter into these contracts due to the uncertain nature of the CPUC.  We will point out that several different independent entities have agreed that long-term contracts are one of the key solutions and that the PUC should act immediately to set a benchmark and in so doing eliminate the reasonableness review that is the main barrier for IOU's not entering into large long-term fixed contracts.  IEP is also currently working to include other market participants in the Press Conference.  We would like as many IEP participants as possible at the conference to show that there are several companies who continue to be serious about long-term fixed price contracts. We have already received a couple of responses and if you are interested please let me know ASAP-no later than noon Wednesday- as we are sending out an advisory on Monday.

IEP will be stressing the importance of the contracts as part of the solution for next summer. Several IEP members have offered (and have continued to offer) long-term fixed contracts at terms under the current retail rate freeze.  We will indicate that the utilities have been hesitant to enter into these contracts due to the uncertain nature of the CPUC.  We will point out that several different independent entities have agreed that long-term contracts are one of the key solutions and that the PUC should act immediately to set a benchmark and in so doing eliminate the reasonableness review that is the main barrier for IOU's not entering into large long-term fixed contracts.  IEP is also currently working to include other market participants in the Press Conference.  We would like as many IEP participants as possible at the conference to show that there are several companies who continue to be serious about long-term fixed price contracts. We have already received a couple of responses and if you are interested please let me know ASAP-no later than noon Wednesday- as we are sending out an advisory on Monday.  Thank you for your attention to this matter.

"If there is a deal shaping up, it's happening by and large through the  auspices of IEP.  We've thus far decided to maintain an arm's length  relationship with IEP, choosing not to get too close to the generators.  If  we want to influence any deal they cut, we'll need to assess how closely  aligned/associated with them we want to be.  Further we distance ourselves,  less likely we'll be cut in.    That said, Sue and I have been participating in IEP's (interminable)  conference calls and actively weighing in to influence what they do.  There  was considerable discussion on the last call about developing some sort of  ""price cap"" proposal that could form the basis of a deal, but no discussion  whatsoever regarding refunds of any kind.  There were differences of opinion  about the benefits of doing a deal on a cap----Williams is dead set against  it, Dynegy & Reliant seemed considerably more pliable.    We reminded folks that there are many other things apart from caps that  California could do to ""fix"" the problem (e.g., site plants, forward  contracts, retail market, core/noncore split, etc.), which might obviate the  need for caps altogether.  We also recognized the political nature of the  situation and expressed a willingness to discuss a cap that might be  acceptable, but pointed out our general concerns with caps.  That last meeting provided the impetus for the 28th press conference, at  which (hopefully) a large number of stakeholders with urge the Governor and  the PUC to get off the dime and do something concrete that can help---develop  a rational policy for forward contracting by the IOUs and abandon the ""PUC as  counterparty"" policy that currently exists.  Again, haven't heard a peep about any deal on refunds.  Will check around,  though.

I called Smutney last week re this press conference and declined.  I said  that the idea is fine and we support it, but Enron does not want to  participate in a press conference with other generators on this topic.  2. I just talked to Rob Lamkin of Southern who indicated that ten companies  have gotten letters from Gov Davis addressed to ""Dear CEO of Energy  Company.""  Letter was to invite these companies to attend a meeting on  Monday, December 1 in LA.  Agenda and issues to follow, but Rob thought it  had to do with the Gov's plan for CA due 12/1.  Meeting will not be with  Davis, but with his staff.  Southern is deciding who to send.  Reliant will  send John Stout and Curtis Keebler.  Williams got a letter, but no info re  their rep.

I called Smutney last week re this press conference and declined.  I said  that the idea is fine and we support it, but Enron does not want to  participate in a press conference with other generators on this topic.  2. I just talked to Rob Lamkin of Southern who indicated that ten companies  have gotten letters from Gov Davis addressed to ""Dear CEO of Energy  Company.""  Letter was to invite these companies to attend a meeting on  Monday, December 1 in LA.  Agenda and issues to follow, but Rob thought it  had to do with the Gov's plan for CA due 12/1.  Meeting will not be with  Davis, but with his staff.  Southern is deciding who to send.  Reliant will  send John Stout and Curtis Keebler.  Williams got a letter, but no info re  their rep.

Robert Hemstock@ECT 11/26/2000 01:19 AM To: Richard Shapiro/NA/Enron@Enron cc: Aleck Dadson/TOR/ECT@ECT   Subject: Update - Proposed Alberta Power Pool Rule Changes  Rick,  You will recall Steve Kean participated in a conference call on Nov 14 with  John Lavorato et al to discuss emergency Pool Rule changes that the Power  Pool intended to implement in two days.  We developed a 5 point action plan  to deal with the proposed Power Pool rule changes that would have a  significant impact on the value of Enron's PPA investment in Alberta.     By way of update to Steve, you may wish to brief him that: 1) It appears the  Power Pool will not proceed with the rule change designed to exclude  importers from setting pool price.  They will proceed with dispatch risk rule  changes but we have given input on those too and I am optimistic that Enron  will be able to live with these rule changes, the final wording of which we  should see on Monday, 2) We  have set up a meeting with the Minister of  Resource Development (you, Rob Milnthorp and I will attend) on December 11 to  encourage the Alberta Government to stay the course, and 3) This week we will  finalize our ""Lessons from other Jurisdictions"" document (that Steve sent me  materials to include in) and will provide it to the Alberta Government and  Power Pool and then follow up with them.     ---------------------- Forwarded by Robert Hemstock/CAL/ECT on 11/25/2000  11:52 PM ---------------------------   Robert Hemstock 11/25/2000 11:53 PM To: Rob Milnthorp/CAL/ECT@ECT, Derek Davies/CAL/ECT@ECT, John  Zufferli/CAL/ECT@ECT, Peter Keohane/CAL/ECT@ECT, Tim Belden/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: aleck.trawick@blakes.com, dpef@blakes.com, Aleck Dadson/TOR/ECT@ECT  Subject: Update - Proposed Alberta Power Pool Rule Changes  The attached memo provides an update on the status of the Power Pool's  further consideration of the proposed rule changes.  In summary, it appears  the Pool will not proceed with the proposal to exclude import offers from  setting pool price but will recommend a rule that reduces ability of  suppliers to become price takers on volumes that were originally priced too  high to clear the merit order.

They made the following points:  The Governor is personally spending a great deal of time on electricity=20 issues (and is forcing them to spend their time on it as well). The Governor recognizes that part of the problem is a supply shortage, but= =20 they put special emphasis on the view that in addition to supply shortfalls= ,=20 a big part of the problem is a ""dysfunctional market"" -- a thinly veiled=20 reference to price manipulation by people sitting in the room. The Governor's view is that all participants (regulators, utilities,=20 customers and generators) must ""behave responsibly"". Everyone must ""share the pain"". The legislative battles are likely to start as soon as the legislature=20 returns next week, and the Governor will be putting forth several legislati= ve=20 proposals in the next couple of weeks. While staff went out of its way to say that the list of proposals (in the= =20 attached e-mail) were unofficial and for discussion purposes only, it was= =20 fairly clear that they defined much of what the governor plans to propose.  The meeting was not very encouraging nor did it provide much in the way of= =20 new information.  The IEP group was on message, making the usual arguments= =20 about the need for forward contracting, expedited generation and transmissi= on=20 siting, a real retail market to promote demand side responses, etc.  The=20 staff is clearly focussed on forward contracting as part of the solution bu= t=20 remains committed to the idea that generators have to cough up some money a= nd=20 remain subject to rate caps, possible restrictions on sales outside the sta= te=20 (at least at peak times), etc.  One approach they appear to be toying with = is=20 a ""share the pain"" proposal which would have utilities absorbing some of th= e=20 deferred costs and consumers absorbing some of the deferred costs in the fo= rm=20 of higher rates.  That leaves generators ... who they might want to either= =20 agree to some refunds or provide power at lower going-forward prices.  The staff says that they remain open to proposed solutions, but the Davis= =20 administration appears unwilling to spend any political capital to fix the= =20 problem. =20  I think we are in for a lengthy legislative and PUC fight.  We should, as= =20 always, provide consistent and reasonable solutions.  I think we should=20 prepare a document for distribution to staff, legislators (and anyone else)= =20 that takes the factual background and proposed solutions we have put forwar= d=20 (eg in Belden's presentation and the Seabron Adamson whitepaper) and wraps= =20 them in a more political context.  In other words, we have already=20 articulated the right answers; we now need to put a political rationale=20 around our proposals -- a set of arguments which responds directly to the= =20 political opposition those answers are likely to encounter.  Jeff will foll= ow=20 up with one of the staff members in particular (Kari Dohn) and I would=20 suggest that Jeff and Sandi work together on putting the necessary politica= l=20 rhetoric around the solutions we have proposed.     =09Jeff Dasovich =09Sent by: Jeff Dasovich =0911/22/2000 04:00 PM =09=09=20 =09=09 To: skean@enron.com, Richard Shapiro/NA/Enron@Enron, Paul=20 Kaufman/PDX/ECT@ECT, Sandra McCubbin/NA/Enron@Enron, Mona L=20 Petrochko/NA/Enron@Enron, Susan J Mara/NA/Enron@ENRON, Joe=20 Hartsoe/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Mary Hain/HOU/ECT@ECT, Sarah=20 Novosel/Corp/Enron@ENRON, mpalmer@enron.com, Karen Denne/Corp/Enron@ENRON,= =20 Alan Comnes/PDX/ECT@ECT =09=09 cc:=20 =09=09 Subject: Options the Governor's Considering  Steve:  FYI.

Even having been at the meeting, reading Steve's assessment of it was very useful.  I certainly concur on the idea of pulling a short document together; could you forward whatever is developed to Sally and me, so we'll be in the loop on that?  Thanks. Spoke with Kari Dohn last night.  She actually had to drop out of going with Gray Davis to the Vicente Fox inauguration in Mexico City to stay behind and work on electricity issues--that's how consumed they are by the whole thing. Lots obviously happening every day out there--and on the FERC front.  Jeff D. obviously is an extremely capable person to be following that closely.   I think Jeff and Kari will have a very productive meeting next Wed.--not to say she is in a position to overrule others with different perspectives and agendas, but she is smart, a good listener, and was very impressed with Steve and Jeff last Monday, so really does want to hear more on what Enron thinks should and can be done to address all of the issues.  And she also understands this is not just sophisticated technical advice; it also has a political sophistication to it. Anyway, thanks again, and look forward to being in touch regularly on this and other matters.

They made the following points:       The Governor is personally spending a great deal of time on      electricity issues (and is forcing them to spend their time on it as      well).      The Governor recognizes that part of the problem is a supply shortage,      but they put special emphasis on the view that in addition to supply      shortfalls, a big part of the problem is a ""dysfunctional market"" -- a      thinly veiled reference to price manipulation by people sitting in the      room.      The Governor's view is that all participants (regulators, utilities,      customers and generators) must ""behave responsibly"".      Everyone must ""share the pain"".      The legislative battles are likely to start as soon as the legislature      returns next week, and the Governor will be putting forth several      legislative proposals in the next couple of weeks.      While staff went out of its way to say that the list of proposals (in      the attached e-mail) were unofficial and for discussion purposes only,      it was fairly clear that they defined much of what the governor plans      to propose.  The meeting was not very encouraging nor did it provide much in the way of new information.  The IEP group was on message, making the usual arguments about the need for forward contracting, expedited generation and transmission siting, a real retail market to promote demand side responses, etc.  The staff is clearly focussed on forward contracting as part of the solution but remains committed to the idea that generators have to cough up some money and remain subject to rate caps, possible restrictions on sales outside the state (at least at peak times), etc.  One approach they appear to be toying with is a ""share the pain"" proposal which would have utilities absorbing some of the deferred costs and consumers absorbing some of the deferred costs in the form of higher rates.  That leaves generators ... who they might want to either agree to some refunds or provide power at lower going-forward prices.  The staff says that they remain open to proposed solutions, but the Davis administration appears unwilling to spend any political capital to fix the problem.  I think we are in for a lengthy legislative and PUC fight.  We should, as always, provide consistent and reasonable solutions.  I think we should prepare a document for distribution to staff, legislators (and anyone else) that takes the factual background and proposed solutions we have put forward (eg in Belden's presentation and the Seabron Adamson whitepaper) and wraps them in a more political context.  In other words, we have already articulated the right answers; we now need to put a political rationale around our proposals -- a set of arguments which responds directly to the political opposition those answers are likely to encounter. Jeff will follow up with one of the staff members in particular (Kari Dohn) and I would suggest that Jeff and Sandi work together on putting the necessary political rhetoric around the solutions we have proposed.

Best, Jeff  **************************************************************************** ****************************************  Several  IEP  companies  have been invited to a meeting with the Governor's staff next Monday, November 27th.   The following are some options, which the Governor's office is considering. IEP  is doing some preliminary research on some of these topics.  IEP would like  to arrange a teleconference call around noon on Monday, November 27th to  discuss  the  Governor's  meeting.  Please advise us as to whether your have been invited, and who you are sending.   California's  electricity supply situation has two inter-related problems ? (1) high wholesale electricity costs, and (2) marginally adequate supply of generation  ?  both  have  combined  to  create  a  dysfunctional wholesale electricity market.  The goals should be:        To  assure reliable electricity to California consumers for the lowest reasonable cost.   o    Consider requiring that all in-state generation be sold in state. o    Consider re-asserting state authority over the operation, maintenance and safety practices of all in-state generating facilities' for public health and safety purposes. o    Consider developing a state power authority to build generation and own/operate transmission. o    Consider requiring utilities both to retain existing and to build new generation. o    Consider providing utilities with authority to stabilize retail prices to be paid by consumers through development of an energy portfolio that reduces exposure to spot markets, including contracting forward for much more of their unmet power needs. o    Consider extending consumer rate freeze. o    Consider centralizing power plant dispatch like the other ISOs in the rest of the country. o    Consider eliminating the ISO and assigning its functions to either a state or private entity that can acquire the transmission facilities, and control the electricity transmission grid (MUNIs have proposed this). o    Consider sponsoring/supporting legislation to change the ISO and PX boards to increase accountability. o    Expand energy conservation programs focused both on immediate peak demand reduction and on longer term, broader-based programs. o    Aggressively work to site new generation and transmission facilities, to streamline permitting, and to develop renewable resources. o    Call for/sponsor federal FERC reform legislation that would: o    Impose a regional price cap that varies by time of day and year; o    Set requirements for FERC to use its retroactive refund authority; o    Improve FERC enforcement over price gouging practices; o    Affirm the role of states to protect their customers from unjust prices. o    Pressure the FERC to do its job to (1) bring about responsible seller behavior in wholesale electric markets through price controls and other market interventions as necessary, and (2) provide refunds to affected consumers. ----- Forwarded by Jeff Dasovich/NA/Enron on 11/22/2000 03:44 PM -----                        Susan J Mara                                           To:     ""CHUDSON"" <carol@iepa.com>                      11/22/2000           cc:     ""Andy Brown \(E-mail\)"" <abb@eslawfirm.com>, chudson@iepa.com,                         03:05 PM             ""Curtis Kebler \(E-mail\)"" <curtis_l_kebler@reliantenergy.com>, ""Delaney                                            Hunter \(E-mail\)"" <dhunter@smithandkempton.com>, ""Greg Blue \(E-mail\)""                                            <gtbl@dynegy.com>, ""Jack Pigott \(E-mail\)"" <jackp@calpine.com>, ""Jeff                                              Dasovich \(E-mail\)"" <jdasovic@enron.com>, ""Joe Ronan \(E-mail\)""                                                   <joer@calpine.com>, ""John Stout \(E-mail\)""                                                                         <John_H_Stout@reliantenergy.com>, jparker@HMOT.com, ""Katie Kaplan                                                   \(E-mail\)"" <kaplan@iepa.com>, kelly@hnks.com, ""Kelly Norton \(E-mail\)""                                            <knorton@mcnallytemple.com>, ""Lynn Lednicky \(E-mail\)""                                                             <lale@dynegy.com>, marie_moretti@msn.com, mrmonagan@aol.com, ""Bob                                                   Weisenmiller \(E-mail\)"" <rbw@mrwassoc.com>, ""Bob Escalante \(E-mail\)""                                             <rescalante@riobravo-gm.com>, ""Rob Lamkin \(E-mail\)""                                                               <rllamkin@seiworldwide.com>, ""Jan Smutny-Jones \(E-mail\)""                                                          <smutny@iepa.com>, ""Steven Kelly \(E-mail\)"" <steven@iepa.com>, ""Susan J                                            Mara \(E-mail\)"" <Susan_J_Mara@enron.com>, ""McNally Temple Assn.

Bob Foster said Edison is very close to declaring bankruptcy.  He said maybe it would be the best thing if the Federal court were involved anyway because he was not having much influence on policy discussions and legislative decisions.  An hour and a half discussion with Steve Peace can be summarized as follows:     1.  He believes Enron has done a masterful job of manipulating the market.     2.  He believes it may not be too late for Enron, specifically Ken Lay, to use the Federal government to stabilize the market.  Lay's influence with Bush could set up a system with true competition (perhaps publicly-owned generation could be a competitor) and fair and just prices.     3.  Peace himself will not be a major player in energy solutions. He'll be in Puerta Vallarta with his wife for half of January to prove the point.     4.  He suggests having Jim Brulte, Senate Minority Leader and Bush campaigner, get involved to promote a proactive solution which includes Ken Lay and President Bush.  (I'm calling Brulte today to get a reaction)     5.  He believes there is a good chance that the Sempra, Edison and PG&E go into bankruptcy.  Ultimately that would be very bad for Enron for a variety of reasons which I could not follow and/or retain.  The Director of the Department of Consumer Affairs said her office received a call yesterday afternoon from the Governor's office directing them, and all other state agencies, to turn off all computers by 4:00 p.m.  The Governor wanted to light the capitol Xmas tree and was concerned there would be too much drain on the power system.  He didn't want to be accused of adding to the electricity shortage, so the trade off was no state compputers would be used while the tree was lit.  The tree was turned off after half an hour.  Sandi has this morning's Sacramento Bee article which described the incident in somewhat different detail.

CC list suppressed...  December 13, 2000  Energy Price Volatility May Hurt Utilities' Credit  By REBECCA SMITH Staff Reporter of THE WALL STREET JOURNAL  Recent volatility in wholesale energy markets is undermining the credit ratings and may eventually crimp the borrowing ability of some of the nation's biggest utilities, long regarded in the credit markets as some of the safest bets around.  It is the worst out West, where the price of power to be delivered Wednesday hit a new high of $1,182 per megawatt hour on California's state-sanctioned auction, a benchmark for the entire region. That compares with $30 a year ago.  But even utilities in the East, such as GPU Inc. of Parsippany, N.J., and Consolidated Edison of New York, also are at risk because they are paying higher prices than ever for spot-market electricity purchases and aren't always able to pass along that cost to their customers.  As an indication of just how bad things are getting, Moody's Investors Service Tuesday put Seattle City Light on ""negative outlook,"" even though it is one of the lowest-cost generators in the nation. There hasn't been much rain in the Northwest this year and the city-owned utility has been forced to go to the wholesale market this month to buy 100 to 200 megawatts of electricity each day. That isn't much energy, but with prices that have gone as high as $1,000 per megawatt hour this week, compared with the $24 per megawatt hour that the municipal utility pays for power from the federal hydroelectric system, costs add up fast. The utility, which issued $100 million in bonds this week, is raising rates 10%, effective Jan. 1, and will keep the rate increase in effect as long as it takes to dig its way out.  ""Prices are at absurd levels,"" says Seattle City Light Superintendent Gary Zarker. ""I know others are looking at significant rate increases too.""  Credit-rating agencies say they are going through their utility portfolios and separating those with exposure to wholesale markets from those that have enough in-house generation to meet customer demand. Then they are trying to figure out which of the ones that are forced to buy on the spot market will be allowed to pass on higher costs and which ones won't.  ""You have the makings of a credit crunch when utilities are required to buy power but aren't allowed to pass the cost through,"" says Steven Fetter, managing director of the global power unit at Fitch, the New York credit-rating agency.  That is exactly the position California's biggest investor-owned utilities are in. Southern California Edison Co., a unit of Edison International, and Pacific Gas and Electric Co., a unit of PG&E Corp., have incurred deficits in excess of $7 billion buying power on the open market since June and were forced to pay higher rates and offer unprecedented guarantees to investors when they last issued bonds.  While they are still making money from the power plants they own, it is nowhere near enough to make up for the shortfall. Credit ratings of both utilities were lowered this week.  Blown the Lid Off  There is no cost relief in sight. California's grid operator last week lifted a price cap for power it buys each hour to keep supply matched with demand. That helped reliability because more generators came forward and offered energy through an orderly market, instead of waiting for harried engineers to call them at the last minute trying to strike a deal.  But it has really blown the lid off prices in the West. The average cost of power sold in the day-ahead market jumped from $250 a megawatt hour last week to $611 on Monday, $904 Tuesday and to $1,182 for power to be delivered Wednesday.  This has a huge impact because it applies to roughly two-thirds of the power consumed in the state and influences prices elsewhere. The situation differs markedly from Eastern markets where only a small proportion of the power consumed comes out of a daily spot market because most utilities have long-term power-purchase contracts that supply most of their needs.  Some of the utilities in the Northwest being slammed by high prices will be in the position of selling power back in May or June, provided there is enough spring-thaw runoff to give them surplus hydropower.  Financial Pain  But utility managers worry it won't be enough to cancel out the financial pain they are currently suffering.  Distribution utilities that deliver the power that others generate were regarded as the safest part of the utility business only a few months ago. Wall Street assigned them the lowest valuations because they face regulated rates of return.  ""Sadly, we now see they chose the part of the business with a lower upside potential and higher risk,"" Mr. Fetter, of Fitch, says.

So there are legal votes that should be counted but can't be.  Q: Oh. Does this have something to do with states' rights? Don't conservatives love that?  A: Generally yes. These five justices have held that the federal government has no business telling a sovereign state university it can't steal trade secrets just because such stealing is prohibited by law. Nor does the federal government have any business telling a state that it should bar guns in schools. Nor can the federal government use the equal protection clause to force states to take measures to stop violence against women.  Q: Is there an exception in this case?  A: Yes, the Gore exception. States have no rights to have their own state elections when it can result in Gore being elected President. This decision is limited to only this situation.  Q: C'mon. The Supremes didn't really say that. You're exaggerating.  A: Nope. They held ""Our consideration is limited to the present circumstances, or the problem of equal protection in election processes generally presents many complexities.""  Q: What complexities?  A: They don't say.  Q: I'll bet I know the reason. I heard Jim Baker say this. The votes can't be counted because the Florida Supreme Court ""changed the rules of the election after it was held."" Right?  A. Dead wrong. The US Supreme Court made clear that the Florida Supreme Court did not change the rules of the election. But the US Supreme Court found the failure of the Florida Court to change the rules was wrong.  Q: Huh?  A: The Legislature declared that the only legal standard for counting vote is ""clear intent of the voter."" The Florida Court was condemned for not adopting a clearer standard.  Q: I thought the Florida Court was not allowed to change the Legislature's law after the election.  A: Right.  Q: So what's the problem?  A: They should have. The US Supreme Court said the Florida Supreme Court should have ""adopt[ed] adequate statewide standards for determining what is a legal vote""  Q: I thought only the Legislature could ""adopt"" new law.  A: Right.  Q: So if the Court had adopted new standards, I thought it would have been overturned.  A: Right. You're catching on.  Q: If the Court had adopted new standards, it would have been overturned for changing the rules. And if it didn't, it's overturned for not changing the rules. That means that no matter what the Florida Supreme Court did, legal votes could never be counted.  A: Right. Next question.  Q: Wait, wait. I thought the problem was ""equal protection,"" that some counties counted votes differently from others. Isn't that a problem?  A: It sure is. Across the nation, we vote in a hodgepodge of systems. Some, like the optical-scanners in largely Republican-leaning counties record 99.7% of the votes. Some, like the punchcard systems in largely Democratic-leaning counties record only 97% of the votes. So approximately 3% of Democratic votes are thrown in the trash can.  Q: Aha! That's a severe equal-protection problem!!!  A: No it's not. The Supreme Court wasn't worried about the 3% of Democratic ballots thrown in the trashcan in Florida. That ""complexity"" was not a problem.  Q: Was it the butterfly ballots that violated Florida law and tricked more than 20,000 Democrats to vote for Buchanan or Gore and Buchanan.  A: Nope. The Supreme Court has no problem believing that Buchanan got his highest, best support in a precinct consisting of a Jewish old age home with Holocaust survivors, who apparently have changed their mind about Hitler.  Q: Yikes. So what was the serious equal protection problem?  A: The problem was neither the butterfly ballot nor the 3% of Democrats (largely African-American) disenfranchised. The problem is that somewhat less than .005% of the ballots may have been determined under slightly different standards because judges sworn to uphold the law and doing their best to accomplish the legislative mandate of ""clear intent of the voter"" may have a slightly opinion about the voter's intent.  Q: Hmmm. OK, so if those votes are thrown out, you can still count the votes where everyone agrees the voter's intent is clear?  A: Nope.  Q: Why not?  A: No time.  Q: No time to count legal votes where everyone, even Republicans, agree the intent is clear? Why not?  A: Because December 12 was yesterday.  Q: Is December 12 a deadline for counting votes?  A: No. January 6 is the deadline. In 1960, Hawaii's votes weren't counted until January 4.  Q: So why is December 12 important?  A: December 12 is a deadline by which Congress can't challenge the results.  Q: What does the Congressional role have to do with the Supreme Court?  A: Nothing.  Q: But I thought ---  A: The Florida Supreme Court had earlier held it would like to complete its work by December 12 to make things easier for Congress. The United States Supreme Court is trying to help the Florida Supreme Court out by forcing the Florida court to abide by a deadline that everyone agrees is not binding.  Q: But I thought the Florida Court was going to just barely have the votes counted by December 12.  A: They would have made it, but the five conservative justices stopped the recount last Saturday.  Q: Why?  A: Justice Scalia said some of the counts may not be legal.  Q: So why not separate the votes into piles, indentations for Gore, hanging chads for Bush, votes that everyone agrees went to one candidate or the other so that we know exactly how Florida voted before determining who won? Then, if some ballots (say, indentations) have to be thrown out, the American people will know right away who won Florida.  A. Great idea! The US Supreme Court rejected it. They held that such counts would likely to produce election results showing Gore won and Gore's winning would cause ""public acceptance"" and that would ""cast[] a cloud"" over Bush's ""legitimacy"" that would harm ""democratic stability.""  Q: In other words, if America knows the truth that Gore won, they won't accept the US Supreme Court overturning Gore's victory?  A: Yes.  Q: Is that a legal reason to stop recounts? or a political one?  A: Let's just say in all of American history and all of American law, this reason has no basis in law. But that doesn't stop the five conservatives from creating new law out of thin air.  Q: Aren't these conservative justices against judicial activism?  A: Yes, when liberal judges are perceived to have done it.  Q: Well, if the December 12 deadline is not binding, why not count the votes?  A: The US Supreme Court, after admitting the December 12 deadline is not binding, set December 12 as a binding deadline at 10 p.m. on December 12.  Q: Didn't the US Supreme Court condemn the Florida Supreme Court for arbitrarily setting a deadline?  A: Yes.  Q: But, but --  A: Not to worry. The US Supreme Court does not have to follow laws it sets for other courts.  Q: So who caused Florida to miss the December 12 deadline?  A: The Bush lawyers who first went to court to stop the recount, the rent-a-mob in Miami that got paid Florida vacations for intimidating officials, and the US Supreme Court for stopping the recount  Q: So who is punished for this behavior?  A: Gore, of course.  Q: Tell me this: Florida's laws are unconstitutional?  A: Yes  Q: And the laws of 50 states that allow votes to be cast or counted differently are unconstitutional?  A: Yes. And 33 states have the ""clear intent of the voter"" standard that the US Supreme Court found was illegal in Florida  Q: Then why aren't the results of 33 states thrown out?  A: Um. Because---um---..the Supreme Court doesn't say---  Q: But if Florida's certification includes counts expressly declared by the US Supreme Court to be unconstitutional, we don't know who really won the election there, right?  A: Right. Though a careful analysis by the Miami Herald shows Gore won Florida by about 20,000 votes (excluding the butterfly ballot errors)  Q: So, what do we do, have a re-vote? throw out the entire state? count under a single uniform standard?  A: No. We just don't count the votes that favor Gore.  Q: That's completely bizarre! That sounds like rank political favoritism! Did the justices have any financial interest in the case?  A: Scalia's two sons are both lawyers working for Bush. Thomas's wife is collecting applications for people who want to work in the Bush administration.  Q: Why didn't they recuse themselves?  A: If either had recused himself, the vote would be 4-4, and the Florida Supreme Court decision allowing recounts would have been affirmed.  Q: I can't believe the justices acted in such a blatantly political way.  A: Read the opinions for yourself: http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/supremecourt/00-949_dec12.pdf (December 9 stay stopping the recount) http://www.supremecourtus.gov/opinions/00pdf/00-949.pdf (December 12 opinion)  Q: So what are the consequences of this?  A: The guy who got the most votes in the US and in Florida and under our Constitution (Al Gore) will lose to America's second choice who won the all important 5-4 Supreme Court vote.  Q: I thought in a democracy, the guy with the most votes wins.  A: True, in a democracy. But America is not a democracy. In America in 2000, the guy with the most US Supreme Court votes wins.  Q: So what will happen to the Supreme Court when Bush becomes President?  A: He will appoint more justices in the mode of Thomas and Scalia to ensure that the will of the people is less and less respected. Soon lawless justices may constitute 6-3 or even 7-2 on the court.  Q: Is there any way to stop this?  A: YES. No federal judge can be confirmed without a vote in the Senate. It takes 60 votes to break a filibuster. If only 41 of the 50 Democratic Senators stand up to Bush and his Supremes and say that they will not approve a single judge appointed by him until a President can be democratically elected in 2004, the judicial reign of terror can end....and one day we can hope to return to the rule of law.  Q: What do I do now?  A: Email this to everyone you know, and write or call your senator, reminding him that Gore beat Bush by several hundred thousand votes (three times Kennedy's margin over Nixon) and that you believe that VOTERS rather than JUDGES should determine who wins an election by counting every vote. And to protect our judiciary from overturning the will of the people, you want them to confirm NO NEW JUDGES until 2004 when a president is finally chosen by most of the American people.  Mark H.

The purpose of the Act is to eliminate  unnecessary regulation of commodity futures exchanges and other entities  falling within the  coverage of the Commodities Exchange Act (""CEA"") and the  provide legal certainty with regard to certain futures and derivatives  transactions.  By enacting such changes, Congress intends to promote product  innovation and to enhance the competitive position of US financial markets.  Certain provisions of the Act open the door for Enron's further product  innovation and growth.  Specifically, the Act provides important legal  certainty for energy and other transactions occuring both on an  over-the-counter (OTC) bilateral basis and on multilateral electronic trading  platforms.  Enron was a leading advocate of passage of this legislation.  Bilateral Transactions  Under the Act, bilateral transactions in all commodities (other than  agriculture commodities) that do not occur on trading facility (i.e. not on a  multi-party exchange) are exempt from most provisions of the CEA as long as  the transactions are entered solely between ""eligible contract  participants""(i.e. persons and certain legal entities satisfying capital  thresholds and other requirements under the Act).  This provision essentially  codifies and expands existing CFTC exemptions for swaps and forward  contracts, thereby eliminating a degree of legal ambiguity that has  frustrated product innovation and growth.    Multilateral Transactions  In addition, the Act creates a broad exemption for any agreement, contract or  transaction in commodities (other than agriculture commodities) so long as  they the transactions are between ""eligible commercial participants"", are  entered into on a ""principle-to-principle basis"" and that take place on a  multi-party ""electronic facility"".  This exemption could facilitate expansion  of EnronOnline to allow for multi-party transactions, however certain legal  requirements will have to be met.  Other Transactions  The Act also creates a broad exclusion for a number of commodities that are  of interest to Enron, including ""credit risk measure"" commodities and weather  derivatives .  Again, the derivative transaction exclusion will have to meet  certain legal thresholds.  This legislation has been over six years in the making and the collective  support of many Enron employees has been crucial.  Thank you to all that have  contributed to the passage on this important legislation.  We will have a  more through legal summary of this legislation in the near future.

It seems like  it was a very long time ago that we worked together on the PECO deal, doesn't  it?  I look forward to doing the panel with you at the Utility M&A Symposium in NY  on Monday, January 29, 2001.  Our panel is set for around 4:00 that  afternoon.  I'll get off a brochure to you, but the panel will discuss price  volatility and what strategies there may be for dealing with it.  I thought  it would be great if you could address the California situation and your  thoughts on why it occurred and what the causes are and perhaps what remedial  measures should be undertaken.  Your thoughts on price caps and the ""hard""  and ""soft"" nature of the various approaches would also be on interest.  I  think people would also have a keen interest in the differences between CA  and other markets, such as PA and perhaps the soon to open Texas market.   I'll follow up with more info as the time gets closer, but you probably may  want to think of a talk in the 25 minute range or so.  I will let the EXNET  (the seminar sponsor) know of your participation.  As you may also know, LeBoeuf sponsors a dinner that evening at LeCirque for  our energy industry clients.  It is usually a good time and many of your  compatriots, including Steve Kean, have attended in the past.  If you can  possibly make it, that would be great.

Gore. Can you explain it to me?  A: Sure. I'm a lawyer. I read it. It says Bush wins, even if Gore got the most votes.  Q: But wait a second. The US Supreme Court has to give a reason, right?  A: Right.  Q: So Bush wins because hand-counts are illegal?  A: Oh no. Six of the justices (two-thirds majority) believed the hand-counts were legal and should be done.  Q: Oh. So the justices did not believe that the hand-counts would find any legal ballots?  A. Nope. The five conservative justices clearly held (and all nine justices agreed) ""that punch card balloting machines can produce an unfortunate number of ballots which are not punched in a clean, complete way by the voter."" So there are legal votes that should be counted but can't be.  Q: Oh. Does this have something to do with states' rights? Don't conservatives love that?  A: Generally yes.

Because---um---..the Supreme Court doesn't say---  Q: But if Florida's certification includes counts expressly declared by the US Supreme Court to be unconstitutional, we don't know who really won the election there, right?  A: Right. Though a careful analysis by the Miami Herald shows Gore won Florida by about 20,000 votes (excluding the butterfly ballot errors)  Q: So, what do we do, have a re-vote? throw out the entire state? count under a single uniform standard?  A: No. We just don't count the votes that favor Gore.  Q: That's completely bizarre! That sounds like rank political favoritism! Did the justices have any financial interest in the case?  A: Scalia's two sons are both lawyers working for Bush. Thomas's wife is collecting applications for people who want to work in the Bush administration.  Q: Why didn't they recuse themselves?  A: If either had recused himself, the vote would be 4-4, and the Florida Supreme Court decision allowing recounts would have been affirmed.  Q: I can't believe the justices acted in such a blatantly political way.  A: Read the opinions for yourself: http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/supremecourt/00-949_dec12.pdf (December 9 stay stopping the recount) http://www.supremecourtus.gov/opinions/00pdf/00-949.pdf (December 12 opinion)  Q: So what are the consequences of this?  A: The guy who got the most votes in the US and in Florida and under our Constitution (Al Gore) will lose to America's second choice who won the all important 5-4 Supreme Court vote.  Q: I thought in a democracy, the guy with the most votes wins.  A: True, in a democracy. But America is not a democracy. In America in 2000, the guy with the most US Supreme Court votes wins.  Q: So what will happen to the Supreme Court when Bush becomes President?  A: He will appoint more justices in the mode of Thomas and Scalia to ensure that the will of the people is less and less respected. Soon lawless justices may constitute 6-3 or even 7-2 on the court.  Q: Is there any way to stop this?  A: YES. No federal judge can be confirmed without a vote in the Senate. It takes 60 votes to break a filibuster. If only 41 of the 50 Democratic Senators stand up to Bush and his Supremes and say that they will not approve a single judge appointed by him until a President can be democratically elected in 2004, the judicial reign of terror can end....and one day we can hope to return to the rule of law.  Q: What do I do now?  A: Email this to everyone you know, and write or call your senator, reminding him that Gore beat Bush by several hundred thousand votes (three times Kennedy's margin over Nixon) and that you believe that VOTERS rather than JUDGES should determine who wins an election by counting every vote. And to protect our judiciary from overturning the will of the people, you want them to confirm NO NEW JUDGES until 2004 when a president is finally chosen by most of the American people.  Mark H.

Three key changes: They clarified that the surcharge applies to Direct Access customers (but the  entire ""rate freeze"" structure remains intact for now). The Commission reversed itself and chose not to adopt TURN's ""netting out"" of  gen revenues and CTC collections, and said instead that the Commission will  consider it as an option in the next phase (a move likely made in order to  lower chances of a successful utility appeal). The Commission added to the decision language saying that it will study the  pros/cons of securitizating the utilities' power purchase costs.  They will  submit a report on the issue to the Governor and Legislature. On this last point, wire reports are rampant about the possibility that  legislation will be introduced as early as today proposing to securitize the  utilties' power purchase costs.  This action has reportedly been the result  of discussions that occured through the night between the governor's office,  the utilities and the ratings agencies in reponse to the fact that the  decision issued by the PUC falls well short of what's needed to keep the IOUs  credit worthy and solvent.  As a result of those wires stories, the  utilities' stock has come back (Edison was down as low as 6.25 and is  currently at 10 7/8; PG&E was at 8 7/8 and is currently at 11 7/8).  We're  working with Sandi McCubbin, who heads-up our legislative activities in  California, to get more info and will report back. The hearing was dominated by highly charged anti-generator, anti-marketer  rhetoric, which is likely to play a prominent role in the press accounts.   Only FERC was demonized more. Each of the Commissioners, including the most recent ""interim"" appointee,   made strong statements regarding the undesirability of utility bankruptcy. The Commission left open the possibility of ""doing more"" at their next  meeting (two weeks from today), which means the negotiations with the  utilities and ratings agencies are likely to continue. And if an agreement is  reached, it could end up on the next agenda.

Your thoughts on price caps and the ""hard""  and ""soft"" nature of the various approaches would also be on interest.

It is usually a good time and many of your  compatriots, including Steve Kean, have attended in the past.  If you can  possibly make it, that would be great.

As  reported earlier, Secretary Abraham and FERC Chairman Hebert will be  testifying at the beginning of the hearing.  Enron would be asked to join a  panel of eight which includes invited witnesses of:  SoCalEd, PG&E, SMUD,  LAWDP, Calpine, Williams and Reliant.  Should Enron accept, EPSA would have  four witnesses on this panel of eight.  When I spoke to Andrew, he said the Committee was more interested in hearing  Enron's testimony on markets, long term contracts, risk management, etc.   than the generation and new power plant construction viewpoints likely to be  offered by the other EPSA witnesses.  He believes this will complement what  the Administration witnesses will say.  Believe it or not, recently, Chairman  Murkowski has made some progress in moving towards supporting Enron's open  access electricity  transmission position, although his draft legislation is  silent on this issue.  Our testimony on the importance of open access for  reliability purposes (""reliability"" would be the tie-in to discuss this issue  in relation to the draft legislation) plus on the need for consistency with  the other existing open access provisions in the Murkowski draft bill  could  provide an excellent platform for Enron to inform many Congressional members  about California, markets and deregulation needs (the Murkowski draft bill  was sent to you earlier and is to be introduced February 5th or 6th.)    Steve, earlier you had asked for the opportunity to do a Hill staff briefing  on California to reach a larger audience with our messages.  I believe this  would provide an excellent opportunity to achieve this goal.  If you would  like, either at a breakfast prior to or in the afternoon after, we could also  do a Press Club briefing and/or arrange to have a room on the Hill (perhaps  on the House side) to invite staffers for additional briefings (and include  the other EPSA witnesses.)  In the alternative, if this hearing date does not work in your schedule,  the  other EPSA witnesses could make some of our points for us.  However, these  points might be somewhat diluted given these witnesses' other priorities.  As  always, you (Jeff and Ken) make a fabulous witness.  Please advise.

No, seriously, we are alarmed. Because history teaches us that whatever   happens to California -- smog, road rage, tofu, coffee that is mainly air,  cell  phones, the belief that abdominal muscles are attractive, Shirley  MacLaine,  people taking in-line skating seriously, grandmothers sporting new  and  flagrantly inappropriate bosoms -- eventually happens to the rest of the  nation.  Thus it is vital that we analyze the California electricity shortage  and see if  we can develop a workable solution before we become bored and  change the  subject.    Our first question is: What, exactly, is electricity? When we look in our   Microsoft Encarta encyclopedia, we see that ""electricity"" is defined  as a  ""class of physical phenomena resulting from the existence of charge  and from  the interaction of charges."" What does this mean, in lay-person's  terms?    It means that whoever wrote the Microsoft Encarta encyclopedia is a big, fat   dope. Because we know from our junior-high-school science training that   electricity is actually a fast-moving herd of electrons, which are tiny   one-celled animals that can survive in almost any environment except inside  a  double-A battery, where they die within minutes.    Electrons are formed when clouds rub together and become excited. This was   proved in the famous experiment wherein Benjamin Franklin flew a kite during  a  thunderstorm and was almost killed. Encouraged by this success, Franklin  went on  to conduct many more electrical experiments, including rolling a  hoop in a  thunderstorm, playing hopscotch in a thunderstorm and doing  somersaults in a  thunderstorm.    Finally one night he was caught wearing only a bonnet and playing Mister   Pooter Rides the Pony in a thunderstorm, leaving the authorities with no  choice  but to arrest him and make him ambassador to France.  Nevertheless,  Franklin had proved an important scientific point, which is  that electricity  originates inside clouds. There it forms into lightning, which  is attracted  to the earth by golfers.    After entering the ground, the electricity hardens into coal, which, when  dug  up by power companies and burned in big ovens called ""generators,""   turns back into electricity, which is sent in the form of ""volts""  (also  known as ""watts,"" or ""rpm"" for short) through special  wires with birds  sitting on them to consumers' homes, where it is transformed by  TV sets into  commercials for beer, which passes through the consumers and back  into the  ground, thus completing what is known as a ""circuit.""    But enough technical talk. The problem is that California is running out of   electricity. The situation is so bad that in some hospitals, they don't have   enough electricity to power those electric-shock paddles that get people's   hearts started again; instead, the doctors and nurses have to hold hands,  scuff  their feet across the carpet in unison, then shout ""CLEAR!"" as they   touch the patient's chest.    Who is responsible for California's electricity shortage? You could blame  the  power companies; or you could blame environmental wackos; or you could  blame the  entertainment industry, which uses more than 750 billion watts of  electricity  per day just to blow-dry the hair of the cast of Dawson's Creek;  or you  could blame (why not?) the Firestone tire company. But you would be  wrong.  Because obviously the real cause of the California electricity  shortage is:  college students.    I base this statement on widespread observation of my son, who is a college   student, and who personally consumes more electricity than Belgium. If my son  is  in a room, then every electrical device within 200 yards of that room --  every  light, computer, television, stereo, video game, microwave oven, etc.  -- will be  running. My son doesn't even have to turn the devices on; they  activate  themselves spontaneously in response to his presence.    Now take my son and multiply him by the number of college students in   California, which according to my research is (EDITOR: Please insert number  of  college students in California) and you see my point, which is (EDITOR:  Please  insert my point).    The question is: What can the rest of us do to help our fellow  countrypersons  in California? The answer is that we can send them our spare  electricity. Just  imagine what would happen if all the households in this  great and generous  nation got out their extension cords and connected them  together, forming a  giant electrical ""chain of helping"" across the fruited  plain to the  Golden State! Millions of people would be turned into generous  smoking lumps of  carbon, that's what. So maybe we should go with Plan B.  This involves building a  really, really, really big kite.

"Yes.  We talked this morning, and I am pleased with the results.  We talked  about integrating our offices fully.  We agreed that I would put together an  office seat assignment chart, which would move John and his folks into our  section of the office.  This will allow  us to more fully integrate our  activities on a daily if not hourly means.  We also talked about how John and  Tom should think about our involvement on international issues.  Our basic  framework, which will need further definition, is to consolidate Joe Hillings  activities into John's  and Tom's portfolios.  By that I see John handling  project based activity and Tom predominantly handling international  legislative issues.  There will of course be overlap but I think the friction  we have seen in the office to date should be mitigated with this approach.   Tom has a very full plate, and even with our new hires, I do not see Tom's  domestic (such as energy and commodities) activities dropping off that much.   This too should lessen friction.  John and I also talked about consolidating  our budgets.  I explained to him how that has worked to date with Joe  Hartsoe's group.  John and I also discussed our outside counsel in the  international arena, including McLarty.  John thought Mac could be very  helpful to us and that we can better focus Mac's assignments.   We also  discussed that I planned to end or multilaterize the Hills Co. engagement at  the end of March.  I am prepared to recommend that we either terminate the  engagement or ask other members of the coaltion to pay an equal share of the  cost, thus potentially our cost to a $2/3K level per month from its current  level of $20K.

"Admittedly , ERCOT was handled poorly from a pleading submission perspective,  but there is a legitimate discussion going on within the company that , at  the very least,  will result in a more flexible approach to market structure  and , perhaps( this is my preference) will result in a sharpening and  refocusing of our positions that will acknowledge the necessity for an  ""LMP""-like approach in real-time to achieve sufficient depth of liquidity.(  with a keen focus on developing forward markets in transmission rights).

Enron has  decided to withdraw the filings we made in ERCOT. Our position on the ERCOT  market structure is being reviewed.    Enron continually goes through a process of reviewing its policies to make  sure they are consistent with our business needs.  I can tell you that there  are some strong supporters of Hogan's policies INSIDE Enron now and these  supporters are finding an ear.    Currently, we are reviewing the positions we are taking on market structure  in ERCOT and the east.  We have to ensure we are practical -- from a business  point of view -- and not being just religious about our views.  Probably the  number one concern of the business people is the ability to have a deep,  liquid market for trading.  I believe that much of the discussion has focused  on the ways in which we can achieve such a market.    After our review of ERCOT, Enron may indeed support a PJM-like structure for  the real-time market, but the filings we make will likely not imply that this  approach be implemented everywhere.  I expect that we will be free to support  different approaches in different parts of the country, depending on the  evolution of the markets in each location.  What does this mean for our position in California?  So far, nothing.  We are  standing firm on our California position, supporting the ISO and  stakeholder-approved approach for congestion management, and do not have any  plans to make new proposals. Further, we have the support of the Traders on  this.  Please feel free to call with any concerns. Believe me, I'm having just as  hard of a time working through this as you all are.

It is all the work of Ron McNamara, a key Enron person in the ERCOT and the Eastern ISO markets. In fact Enron is bringing next week to the PUCT hearings in Texas no other than Bill Hogan himself.

am very pleased to announce the following promotions that became effective  February 1, 2001.   Steve Montovano - Sr. Director to Vice President: Steve, as regional head for  the Eastern Seaboard area, has developed a very effective team that has  brought a very commercially focused approach to their efforts in that region.  Steve and his team have developed a model approach to transactional support  and origination that has made them an integral part of the commercial teams  that work in his region. Steve's efforts have been recognized by all,  particularly his commercial counterparts in the region.  Jeff Dasovich - Director to Sr. Director: As part of the Western States team,  Jeff has helped to coordinate Enron's actions in response to California's  energy crisis.  Throughout this crisis he has worked closely with Enron  Energy Services, Enron North America and senior management of the company in  a way that fully reflects Enron's core values.  He has provided and continues  to provide leadership on complex issues involving business and litigation  risk.  Jeff has also provided tremendous value to the business units on a  number of transactions arising from the crisis.   Steve Walton - Director to Sr. Director:  Steve, as part of the group within  Government Affairs focusing on wholesale market issues, has provided  extraordinary leadership with respect to the development of RTO's in the  Western United States.  Steve's insights and experiences have also proven to  be invaluable in the group's national efforts.  Lisa Yoho - Director to Sr. Director: Lisa has been a valuable member of the  Eastern Seaboard team and , more recently has assumed responsibility for  Enron Global Markets and Enron Networks. Lisa has been an integral team  member in trying to establish a market for secondary rail transportation  capacity and in helping to launch the company's efforts into  the  agricultural commodity business. In  these and many other efforts in which  Lisa has been involved, Lisa has consistently demonstrated substantive  leadership and excellence.  Donna Fulton - Manager to Director:  Donna joined Governmental Affairs this  past summer, and has made excellent contributions to our RTO efforts, the  sale of Portland General, and various commercial endeavors ranging from gas  matters to licensing of a hydroelectric project in California.  Her extensive  experience before the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has proven  invaluable to the Office.    Lara Leibman - Manager to Director:   Lara consistently has produced very  high quality work across a number of industries and issues.  Most recently,  she has developed both regulatory and technical knowledge on issues related  to developing a secondary market for wireless spectrum.  This has enabled her  to provide a valuable leadership role while working closely with her  commercial counterparts in this and other areas.  Charles Yeung - Manger to Director:  Charles has been a key player in  promoting changes to North American Electric Reliability Council (NERC)  operating policies that affect the East Trading Desk.  His understanding of  the NERC policies and leadership role in NERC committees and working groups  has been essential to successfully advocating meeting the needs of Enron.  Allison Navin -  Legislative Coordinator to Manager.  Allison has been  responsible for the research and tracking of key issues and legislation in  the Washington, DC office as well as coordinating briefing and informational  materials and has done an outstanding job  in the execution of all of her  resposibilities.

This they cannot do.  California has a substantial investment in  units located in Nevada, Arizona, New Mexico and Utah.  The lights would go  out in California if they opened the ties.  In the 1970's there was a hue and  cry over loop flow, with California claiming that it was being injured by  others, particularly by the interior systems trading practices, however they  never considered opening the ties, because the benefits of interconnection  were so large that the ""cost"" of loop flow was far exceeded by the value of  regional trade, i.e., they are economically interdependent.   If such a foolish thing were done and California full ""closed its doors"" by  opening its ties, cost would go up in the Northwest, in California and all  the rest of the Western System.  There are ""gains for trade"" which accrue to  all parties from interconnection.  The trade is more complicated than just  summer/winter peaks (seasonal load diversity) there is also seasonal resource  diversity (Spring run off effects) and finally there opportunity to  capitalize on storage vs base load thermal operations.  I will address the  last point first to illustrate the complexity of the trading patterns.   The interior west (Montana, Wyoming, Utah, Arizona and New Mexico) has large  amount of base load coal plants.  As load drops off in those areas, the  energy flows to the coast to back off peaking plants and to back off hydro.   The reduction of hydro production allows night time reservoir refill which  can be used to meet peak load in the Northwest and California.  This can be  seen in the attached file, which contains a set of plots for hourly flow on  the Pacific DC Intertie Jun97, Dec 97, Jun 98, Dec 98, Jun 99, Dec 99,  Jun00.  In these plots the clear day/night exchange of energy can be seen,  especially in the Jun00 plot when sales are being made to California in the  day and to the Northwest at night.  This day to night storage exchange  benefits lowers costs for everyone.   On top of this daily/weekly cycle, there is the seasonal shift in load  diversity you noted.  For the Northwest, its peak load occurs when energy  production is the lowest -- during the winter.  As a stand alone system, the  Pacific Northwest (i.e., the Columbia Drainage area) is energy constrained.   The hydro in that area does not produce enough energy to meet annual needs.   There is plenty of generating capacity to meet any peak, but not enough to  total water flow.  Energy imports from Wyoming and Montana (e.g. Colstrip and  Bridger) are required to allow the Pacific Northwest to meet its annual  energy requirement.  With these energy inputs from the coal fields, the  seasonal water budget can be arranged to get the most value out of the hydro  system, although fish, navigation, irrigation, etc. impose an increasing  number of constraints.  Energy imports from in the winter from the South help  to meet this energy balance during the winter so water can be reserved until  the snow pack is better know in early Spring.  Some of the sales to the  Northwest from California during the winter are a result of displacement from  Desert Southwest energy moving through California and then up the Interties  to the Northwest.     Finally, the Spring run off/fish flush when production on the river is at a  maximum and load in the Northwest is down.  The sale of these surpluses paid  for the Pacific Intertie lines and remain important to the entire system.   Much system maintenance of base load units has been historically been planned  to take advantage of this factor.  Again both California and the Northwest  benefit from this trade.     In all cases, the parties would be worse off if the ties were open and  everyone was on their own.  The Northwest may be capacity long, but it is  typically energy short, even in flush hydro years.  The winter energy imports  from the South hold Northwest costs down just as spring run off sales to the  South lower energy costs in California.  California cannot craft a solo  solution that ignores the rest of the West.  It is probably hard to decide  who would be worst off if California ""closed its doors"".  It is only clear  that total cost would rise in both California and the rest of the West from  which it divorced itself.   I hope this rambling response comes at the question you raise.

I understand that the good 'ol utility system was often  operated with little regard for basic economic principles, but there's  something in this that seems very odd and difficult to assess, and it seems  to always be tied to this notion that ""California is a net importer, even in  the winter.""  I'm going to start with the economics and then let folks  describe why it seemingly doesn't apply in Western electricity markets.  Just about every theory of economics and trade would lead to one conclusion:   If California closes it's doors the other Western states will pay higher  prices for power and/or face increased threats to reliability.  I'm  struggling to try to determine why these basic principles aren't applicable  to Western power markets.  I understand that the PNW is a very complex place  and that the reasons could be embedded in the arcane structure that has  developed over the years.  To keep it simple (though not necessarily accurate), I've confined the  analysis to a world in which only the PNW and California exist.  The basic situation: The PNW peaks in the winter; California peaks in the  summer.  Let's take two scenarios:  1)  The West, less California, is so awash in electricity that even in its  peak--the Winter--it still has power to send to California, i.e., it has so  overbuilt it's system that it has persistent surpluses to sell to California.  Irrespective, there have (to my limited knowledge) always been sales from CA  to the PNW during the winter, when the PNW is peaking. The only conclusion that one can make, assuming that the PNW is awash in  electricity, is that the PNW takes the power in California because it makes  economic sense to do so. That is, during the winter peaking months, it must  be cheaper on the margin for the PNW to buy from California rather than  produce itself.  Otherwise, it's difficult to understand why it would buy  from California during this month, particularly if they're long.  As such, at  a minimum, the PNW's electric bill will necessarily increase if California  closes its doors.  2) Neither the PNW , nor California, has indigenous capacity to meet peaking  load.  Therefore, the PNW must buy California's power during its peaking  summer period, and California must buy power during it's summer peaking  period.  In this case, not only will the PNW's bill go up if California  closes its doors, the lights are likely to go because they'll be short power.  I realize that this is a simplistic model, and that there could be other  legitimate economic factors driving the flows out of California to the PNW  (e.g., transmission costs).  And again, I also realize that economics may not  have traditionally been a driver in the industry.  But I thought it might be  useful to get a common framework in place as a starting point for the  question that Jim asks.  With that, I'll pose the question (understanding the simplicity of the model  set forth above):  Given that California sends power north--even if the PNW  is long---how can California closing it doors not increase the PNW's cost of  power?  Best, Jeff     James D Steffes  02/28/2001 08:05 AM       To: Alan Comnes/PDX/ECT@ECT    cc: Jeff Dasovich/NA/Enron@Enron, Mary Hain/HOU/ECT@ECT, Steve  Walton/HOU/ECT@ECT, Susan J Mara/NA/Enron@Enron    Subject: Re: Cost of Protectionism  It seems to me that this information leads one to conclude that the value of  an open transmission network is that California does not have to build 5,000  MW of power plant (4,500 MW max input + 10%) in state.  In other words, if  California were to disconnect from the grid, someone would have to build  additional power plants in-state.  The cost to California consumers is therefore the annual carrying cost of 10  500 MW plants (made even more expensive after California expropriates the  current fleet of merchant generation).  From the perspective of the remainder of the West, the question still remains  - if California does go it alone, what is the economic impact?  Other than  legal arguments about Interstate Commerce, why should the Federal Government  want to continue to pursue open acess?  This is the hard question that we  need to answer.

Here are some things to consider.  We can talk more and I welcome Sue Mara or  Steve Walton's input:  California is a net importer so any restraint of trade would risk the state  being able to meet its own demand.  See attached slides that show PNW-CA  trade.  Even in the winter, power on a net basis flows south.  Limiting open access would primarily act to hold in-state generators hostage.  this will kill incentives for new investment  If the ISO's proposal for market power mitigation are any guide of where a  protectionist ISO would go:  in-state generators would be required to sell forward or lose their market  based rate certificates  load serving entities would be required to contract forward for load and a  reserve margin.     This is costly: it will lead to centralized planning solutions to  reliability rather than more efficient market     outcomes  Artifical notions of ""just and reasonable"" rates (on top of unreasonable  reserve requirements) would lead to severe   reliability problems.  (In other  words, if Steve Peace has his way, the imports into the state will drop  off     signficanly)  There is no reason the state would be more effective at expanding the grid  (e.g., Path 15) than the current system.  (Although, admittedly the current  system has flaws.  The CAISO was set up with little thought to transmission  expansion planning.  Other RTOs are not repeating this mistake.).

"Rick,  Barbara and Kerry are traveling to Missouri tommorrow to negotiate with  Ameren.  This bill which will be an industrial buy-through only (due to  complications with Constitutional Amendments in Missouri involving a  requirement for a referendum for any tax law changes).   The bill applies to  industrials greater than 1 MW in Ameren and 2 MW everywhere else.  In  speaking to EES, they want us to try and get the threshold reduced to 500kw  to 1mw.  ENA wants load following in order to sell blocks of power to large  industrials.  In addition, there are a host of other issues, including,  insufficient regulatory review for shifting generation into a genco, no code  of conduct for that genco and Illinois-styled stranded cost recovery.  Kerry  and Barbara have a tough assignment to get anything here.  We thought it  would be best to see how these negotiations go before formulating what kind  of message we would like Ken Lay to deliver if he is willing.  To make  matters worse, the industrial group has already caved on the bill.

Laurie Knight 03/15/2001 10:56 AM To: Steven J Kean/NA/Enron@Enron, Richard Shapiro/NA/Enron@Enron cc: Janine Migden/NA/Enron@Enron, Harry Kingerski/NA/Enron@Enron, James D  Steffes/NA/Enron@Enron   Subject: Missouri Legislation and Request for Assistance from Ken Lay   FROM: BARBARA HUETER  KERRY STROUP   The Missouri Senate Commerce and Environment Committee is expected to pass  Sub.SB455 when it returns from spring break during the week of March 26th or  the following week.  Senate President Pro Tem Peter Kinder introduced the  bill for AmerenUE.  AmerenUE is controlling the process. We must go through  Ameren for changes - and they are not very willing to concede.    We would like to arrange for Ken Lay to call Senator Kinder to express  Enron's concerns about the bill (market structure, lack of benefits for  customers).  Our local lobbyist, Roy Cagle, could let Senator Kinder know  that Ken Lay would like to speak with him and arrange an appropriate time for  the call to take place.  It would be most helpful if the call could take  place by March 26th.  Senator Kinder graduated from the U of Missouri-Columbia in the 1970's.  He  was a member of the same fraternity as Ken Lay.  Peter also met Ken at the  Republican Convention last summer -- and seemed very excited about it.  Also,  being a Republican, Peter seems very impressed by Ken Lay's relationship with  the President.  We think this is a good opportunity for Enron to gain some  leverage over Ameren via Senator Kinder.  Kerry and I are analyzing the various drafts and suggestions for changes to  the bill.  We are working with numerous other stakeholders  -- so the actual  contents of the deal/bill are in constant flux.  We would prepare a briefing  for Mr. Lay but would wish to do so closer to the time of the call so that  Mr. Lay will have the  most up-to-date information.  In a nutshell -- the bill allows a utility to spin off generation assets to a  genco at historic net book value.  The utility would then sign a PPA with the  genco to provide for the full requirements of its captive customers as well  as eligible customers who have not chosen an alternative supplier.  Customers  over 1MW in Ameren's service territory and those over 2MW in other service  territories (munis and coops excluded) would be able to arrange buy-through  type arrangements with registered suppliers. The bill does not contain  adequate transmission access language, a code of conduct, appropriate  unbundling language nor does it address a host of other market structure  issues that are key to developing robust competition.

"Rick -    I've printed the budget report for your cost center.    The cost center report indicates that the budget for outside services if  8,685,000 so we will need to talk to Elizabeth or someone in accounting why  that number is not 9,000,000.    The cost center report indicates that we have spent 1,137,638.34 for outside  services which leaves a variance to budget of 7,547,361.66 available.    The RCR Budget Report indicates that we have approved 2,235,071 year to  date.  If you take the amount spent for outside services plus the amount  approved to date for RCR's the total equals 3,372,709.34.  If you take the  3,372,709.34 less budget the variance is 5,312,290.66 available.  That  assumes that the approved to date RCR will all be spent in 2001 and does not  account for what has been spent to date for RCR costs.  The budget report for your cost center indicates that actuals year to date  equal 4,951,697.40 compared to an annual budget of 21,437,591 leaves a  variance of 16,485,893.60 available for the year.

Gray Davis is searching for answers to California's energy crisis,  he also has been polling voters about potential solutions and trying to  convince ""opinion leaders"" that he is taking decisive action.  Interviews with Davis' pollster, lawmakers and those on the receiving end of  the publicity campaign offer a glimpse into the tight link between policy and  politics as the governor negotiates a way out of the power crunch. Recently, as independent polls showed that 3 in 4 Californians believe the  crisis is the state's No. 1 problem, Davis backed a bill that could lead to  electricity rate increases after saying for months that he opposed them.  Last week, the governor's office sent a statement titled ""Meeting the Energy  Challenge"" to nearly 2,000 ""opinion leaders and decision- makers,"" touting  Davis' record and refuting the claims of critics that he has been too slow to  act.  Fortuna Union High School District Superintendent Dennis Hanson, whose  Humboldt County office received one of the faxes, was offended by what he saw  as an attempt to manipulate him.  ""Making it political provides no solutions,"" said an angry Hanson, whose  district is preparing for a utility bill that is potentially $50,000 higher  this school year. ""The unwillingness of anybody to take responsibility  boggles my mind.""  Davis' aides insist that the governor isn't preoccupied with the views of  voters despite his political operation polling Californians on the energy  issue since last summer. Some critics suggest that Davis' fear of a public  backlash has exacerbated his usual cautiousness and contributed to the energy  crisis.  ""That's ridiculous,"" said Davis pollster Paul Maslin. ""We do a lot less  polling than anybody understands. For significant periods of this entire  issue, there has not been polling going on. It's a far cry from (the)  perception from recent White Houses where everything must be polled.""  The surveys of Californians, which are paid for by Davis' political campaign,  help frame issues and determine factors such as the public's willingness to  conserve, Maslin said. The responses are not used to guide intricate policy  decisions, he said.  At the same time, however, Maslin explained that his polling shows residents  clearly don't want electricity service left to the vagaries of the free  market; they want some kind of government command of the system; and they're  willing to trade some rate increases for greater certainty.  ""If you had to boil it down, they want greater control here somehow,"" Maslin  said. ""I think the governor and the Legislature would be well served to  listen to that right now.""  In fact, recent proposals by the governor and the Legislature -- such as the  state's $10 billion purchase of long-term power or a state takeover of the  utility transmission system -- show they are addressing such concerns.  Political analysts say Davis' polling reflects a pervasive reliance by  politicians at all levels of government on public opinion -- a focus that is  not helpful when confronting a highly technical matter like energy policy.  Indeed, Davis is not alone. Democratic Assembly leaders recently used their  own poll numbers to convince colleagues to spend $400 million in taxpayer  money to buy electricity.  Polls are crude instruments that pose simplistic questions to people who are  often uneducated about the issues, said Professor Barbara O'Connor, director  of the Institute for the Study of Politics and Media at California State  University, Sacramento.  ""I think it's the absence of leadership when politicians base their behavior  on what people think of them,"" O'Connor said.  The state GOP might agree. The party bucked the desires of Republican  legislative leaders and aired radio commercials last week criticizing Davis'  leadership on the crisis. The ads began running yesterday in the Bay Area. At  least one Republican had asked the party to discontinue the ads.  So far, Maslin said Californians are not blaming Davis for the power  problems, because they see it as caused by deregulation legislation passed in  1996, when Republican Gov. Pete Wilson was in office.  ""The way they view the current governor and the Legislature is: 'Fix it,' ""  he said. "" 'We're not blaming you because we understand it didn't happen on  your watch, but get us out of this mess.' ""  As the state's chief executive, Davis has been criticized by industry  executives, analysts, lawmakers and regulators for his wariness.  In contrast, the statement Davis officials faxed last week to police and fire  chiefs, heads of school districts, municipal officials and the like, praised  his ""bold, decisive leadership.""  Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio described the fax as a tool for public  education.  ""It's just information. It's not political at all,"" Maviglio said. ""This is  part of a continuing effort the governor's office has done to inform the  community about the governor's actions and policies. It was first used during  the education proposals last year.""  Outraged utility executives, meanwhile, said the governor's fax wrongly  blamed them for not being more proactive.  ""I'm appalled by reading such a statement,"" said Harold Ray, executive vice  president of Southern California Edison Co.  Ray was particularly irked by a passage about long-term contracts between the  state's major utilities and power providers. The governor's fax claimed that  since Davis appointed Loretta Lynch president of the state's Public Utilities  Commission last March 22, the PUC has approved every request from the  utilities for authority to sign long-term contracts ""in a timely fashion.""  Ray claims that signing contracts directly with generators instead of through  a state-run exchange could have saved his company about $1 billion.  On Aug. 3, the commission ostensibly gave the utilities authority to sign  such contracts, but Edison and Pacific Gas and Electric Co. executives say  the regulators refused to approve contracts or to provide guidelines for  them.  The commission's energy division is supervised by Lynch. She told The  Chronicle that the utilities should simply have acted without guidance from  commission staff.  Democratic Assemblyman Dennis Cardoza, chair of the Rules Committee, said he  believes that the PUC has contributed to energy market dysfunction in recent  years.  Cardoza, however, praised Davis for now aggressively pursuing new generating  plants in California, and said any spin control will likely be irrelevant in  the end because results will be what matters.  ""I don't think any amount of damage control is going to fix things if we  don't get control of this,"" said Cardoza. ""If we're able to solve the  problem, we get kudos. If we don't, we get dinged.""   PHOTO; Caption: Gov.

NEWS Californians Cast a Cold Eye At Power Crisis, Polls Find / Shortages join  education as top concern Katherine Seligman Chronicle Staff Writer  01/18/2001 The San Francisco Chronicle FINAL A11 (Copyright 2001)  Yes, the energy crisis is serious, but most Californians see it as a plot by  power companies seeking to jack up utility bills, according to the latest  energy poll by the Field Institute.  The poll released today found Californians growing more dubious about the  roots of the so-called crisis. More than half of those surveyed, 57 percent,  said the shortage amounts to an attempt to raise rates, rather than an  emergency born purely from lack of generating sources or from increased  demand. Real or fabricated, the public is overwhelmingly concerned about the crisis  and is staying tuned to news of blackouts and energy grids (both the Field  Poll and one from the Public Policy Institute of California show almost  everyone is following the news).  In fact, the energy shortage has joined education as a top concern for  Californians, according to the Public Policy Institute poll, also released  today. That poll reveals that almost 75 percent of Californians say energy is  ""a big problem"" and only about half of those polled think economic good times  are ahead -- a drop from 72 percent in August.  And state residents are mad at just about everyone for the energy situation  and the looming shortages.  ""The public is in a pretty foul mood,"" said Mark DiCamillo of the Field Poll.  ""They blame just about everybody. . . . The public is pretty cynical about  how we got to this situation.""  When asked who's to blame for the situation, about three-quarters of those in  the Field Poll pointed the finger at failure to build new power plants, the  state's private utility companies and the state Public Utilities Commission.  More than 60 percent blamed the federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the  state Legislature, activist groups that blocked new plant construction and an  increase in industrial energy use.  Gov. Gray Davis, however, came out on top of the electrical heap, with only  43 percent blaming him for the current situation. Fifty- three percent blamed  his predecessor, Pete Wilson.  Most respondents said they take at least somewhat seriously the potential for  utility company bankruptcy and with it the threat of blackouts. When it comes  to solving the problem, most want the state government to step in and become  a middleman, buying electricity for the utility companies, the Field Poll  found.  Davis has argued that the state can get better prices because of its good  credit rating. The electricity would then be sold to the power companies.  In order to fix the problem, most Californians, 61 percent, think the state  should go back to regulating the energy industry. Only 30 percent of those in  the Field Poll said they think the crisis can be solved without  re-regulation.  In the Public Policy Institute's poll, only 37 percent advocated  re-regulation, with 32 percent favoring the construction of more power plants  and 20 percent leaning toward more conservation.  Although they are deeply concerned about the energy shortage, most  Californians responded in the Field Poll that they don't want air quality  standards relaxed to produce more electricity. Only 32 percent thought that  solution was satisfactory.  But when asked if air quality standards should be relaxed in some areas to  get older plants functioning and to speed approval of new plants,  Californians were more divided. Almost half, 47 percent, approved of that  strategy. Forty-six percent opposed it.  The energy problems don't bode well for the state, according to those  surveyed by the Public Policy Institute. Eighty-two percent said they thought  the issue will damage the state's economy in the next few years, with more  than half saying it will hurt the economy ""a great deal.""  ""Californians are deeply worried about the implications of this crisis for  the state economy and their own pocketbooks,"" said the institute's survey  director, Mark Baldassare. ""Right now, they are still holding out hope, but  their optimism, as well as the political fortunes of state leaders, may  suffer if they fail to see some action soon.""  The private nonpartisan research institute conducted its survey Jan. 2-8, by  phoning 2,011 residents. The Field Poll surveyed 1,001 Californians Jan.  12-16.  ------------------------------------------------------------------  ------------CHART: FIELD POLL / CALIFORNIA ENERGY-- How serious is the  state's electricity situation?Statewide: Very serious 58% Somewhat serious  31% Not serious 9% No opinion 2%Customer served by:PG&E Very serious 60%  Somewhat serious 31% Not serious 7% No opinion 2%S.

In order to reduce Enron's non-market risks ( e.g. legal, credit  and regulatory) in the volatile commodity markets in California or any ""  future California"", we propose the following changes:  1.    Mandatory Uniform Set-Off Provisions in All Trading Contracts for All  Commodities -- set-off language varies commodity by commodity in trading  contracts.  Set-off is one of the most critical tools available to Enron in a  major default situation and it is critical to have set-off language and to  have it be uniform commodity to commodity so that Enron can get the best  advantage from set-off and not just the least common denominator.  2.     Master Netting Agreements For Appropriate Counterparties With Multiple  Masters With Significant Opposite Exposures -- where it is necessary to have  multiple masters with a counterparty, a ""bridge"" should be put in place  between the masters whenever there is significant opposite exposures under  the two or more masters.  3.     Merge EPMI into ENA -- power trades are done through EPMI.  Merging  EPMI into ENA and conducting power trades through ENA is much more efficient  from both a credit and legal point of view.  4.     No Automatic Termination for a Bankruptcy Event -- in the PGE/SCE  situation, it should be the non-defaulting party's (Enron in this case)  option to terminate rather than an automatic termination on ""inability to pay  debts as they become due"".  Let me know if you have any other proposed changes to our trading contracts  or entities through which we conduct our trading.  I believe these changes  will (i) improve efficiency, (ii) reduce risks, (iii) develop the opportunity  to do more business with certain counterparties and (iv) substantially  improve Enron's position in the next California type market.  The long range  goal is to conduct as much as possible of the trading business through a  single entity and a single or limited number of standardized agreements.

Kerry Stroup 03/30/2001 05:03 PM To: Richard Shapiro/NA/Enron@Enron, James D Steffes/NA/Enron@Enron cc: Janine Migden/NA/Enron@Enron   Subject: Missouri genco bill issues and a proposed strategy  (from Barbara and Kerry)  Ameren UE has been successful in developing political support for a bill that  would permit each Missouri IOU to transfer its generation assets to a genco  at net book value.  The genco would enter into a five-year term purchased  power arrangement with the utility, with subsequent minimum three-year term  renewals.  Each utility transferring its generation assets would be required  to establish a ""dedicated supply"" tariff for large customers, who could elect  to obtain energy from alternative suppliers in a buy-through arrangement.   Alternative suppliers would be required to sell dedicated supply to the  utility in a wholesale transaction; the utility would transport the power to  the large customers, who, from an operational perspective, remain native load  customers of the utility.    The Senate Commerce and Environment Committee has passed the bill, which will  be considered by the Senate sometime in the next several weeks.  If the  Senate passes the bill, the debate will resume in the House.  Legislators are  interested in moving the bill because they believe it will improve  reliability of supply in Missouri.  Ameren UE has postponed building  generation, and will require an additional 800 MW for next summer.  In the  wake of the California situation, the legislative interest is not in  providing a competitive discipline to the marketplace.  Ameren has promoted a  genco structure as necessary for mitigating the investment community's  concern over regulatory risk associated with building new generation  facilities under traditional rate of return regulation.  There are a number of problems with the bill. From a retail aspect, it will  be difficult if not impossible to compete for large customers, who will be  able to procure power from the utility at FERC established cost-based rates  that are currently below market.  In its present form the bill does not  include meaningful code of conduct provisions, and it permits the utility to  enter into billing and metering ""experiments"" in which customers can be  aggregated and sold utility services at unregulated rates.  Although the bill  requires that rates for utilities establishing gencos must be reestablished  in rate cases within twelve months prior to  the transfer of generation  assets, it is unclear the extent to which rates will be unbundled.  Finally,  alternative generation suppliers and their customers would be subject to  balancing charges, which render physical transactions untenable at this time.   From the wholesale perspective, the bill is unacceptable because incremental  resources required to serve Missouri retail load are not required to be  competitively procured.  An earlier version of the bill would have permitted  competitive procurement of additional generation sources at the utility's  discretion, but was removed at the request of the Missouri PSC staff, who are  sensitive to the legislature's focus on the issue of reliability.  The bill is sponsored by President Pro-Tem Peter Kinder, who in the past  introduced comprehensive legislation that required competitive procurement  for customers not choosing alternative supply sources.  Although Senator  Kinder told Barbara and Roy Cagle that he would support passage of a bill  this year, he does not appear to be taking an active interest in the details  of the legislation.  Senator Kinder belonged to the same fraternity at the University of Missouri  as Ken Lay, though they didn't attend college together.  Senator Kinder has  voiced his admiration of Ken Lay, and met him at the Republican Convention  this year.  It might be possible to persuade Senator Kinder to improve the  bill, if Ken Lay were to communicate personally with him.  We recommend that Senator Kinder be persuaded to alter the bill to require  competitive procurement for incremental generation resources.  On the basis  of our discussions with EES and ENA, it appears that taking steps to address  retail market structure problems will not put us in a position to compete  effectively for large customers in the short and mid term.         Barbara and I will prepare briefing materials for Ken Lay, if you wish to  proceed in this fashion.  Please advise.

"Rick. Let's pause and reflect on this bullet. Do we want to argue for that?  This is going to start another Federal/State rights war!! and I do not  believe this is going to help much and would require legislation.  Federal siting and permitting authority must be expanded to allow for the  construction of new transmission and generation facilities.  Maybe in some less populated states, or for sitting facilities in the middle  of no-where this is not a problem, but my experience in Florida is that the  sitting process is very much intertwined with property rights and ROW  acquisition, ultimately relying on condemnation.  To get there, in Florida  there is a process  to establish that there was a ""public need"" that required  government action.   At FPL we relied on the process to obtain an eventual  outcome where there was the force-of- law [of the greater public good to be  able to obtain the ROW].  This was crucial for the  Transmission ROW for all  lines greater than 240 KV. (Many more individual owners and 100% needed to  complete the connection within the selected route).   The sitting process for  the generation site was not as controversial, because we acquired  (or held  rights to) sites which had been pre-screened to avoid controversy; but,   obviously a permit for a generation site is useless if you can't get the  power into the grid, thus you need the Transmission ROW.  Part of the process involved providing options/ and costs, community  involvement, etc.  - which ultimately resulted in a ""choice""  determined to  have been ""prudently"" undertaken, ( Longer much costly line, part  underground, etc,)  In every case, there were ""not in my back-yard"" arguments, at times disguised  as an EMF issue. Also, in every case, the authorities knew that they had to  select one option, or make one on their own. Not selecting one meant that  there would be power shortages and they would have to answer to the people  impacted, the local voters.    Under the regulatory framework, where there will be concurrent filings for  competing projects, the determination of ""public need"" will be more difficult  to acertain.

This has been confirmed  after receiving input from Enron management in legal, commercial, and  government affairs.   One concern was that a future PGE sale would be in some way be impacted if  Jim Doty were to recuse himself given his relationship with Enron. All agree  he would recuse himself, which we knew when he was retained, and that the  impact would be minimal.  Another concern, was the Washington media reported  that Doty had in some way alienated Sen. or Mrs. Gramm, it was reported back  to me that is not the case and the Gramm's do not oppose the Doty nomination.  The SEC nomination process is still moving rather slow and that no candidate  has pulled in front, according to our DC consultants.   The letter states Enron's broad support for Doty's nomination. It does not  advocate any particular policy position or issue.    << File: SECAPP3.doc >>      ",richard.shapiro@enron.com,chris.long@enron.com,SEC Chair Letter Address,2001-04-11 07:31:00-07:00,received

I am certainly involved in the domestic portion of the project, lobbying and  educating Venezuelan authorities on its benefits in particular, and the  benefits of an open and transparent market in general. I am working closely  with Emilio Vicens and Guido Caranti who are leading the development of the  project. The three of us have written extensive comments to regulations, have  met on several opportunities with the regulator and with the Ministry of  Energy and Mines (MEM), making significant progress on this front, such as  allowing to create a working group to study the project in detail. The actual  creation is still pending, but we will bring this issue during a meeting  scheduled this week.  Politics surrounding this project are complicated. PDVSA has traditionally  imposed its views on MEM, who rubberstamped all its decisions. With the  Chavez Administration, things have changed dramatically, almost paralizing  every PDVSA initiative. Since PDVSA is the one that really needs to obtain  the permit to supply the gas, PDVSA was ""in charge"" of dealing with MEM.  Given this environment, and once the commercial terms with PDVSA were in  place, Enron decided (of course, with PDVSA's approval) to be proactive,  starting a demonstration tour of the project to capture MEM's and the  regulator's interests.   Moreover, the initiative to involve the USG started with a conversation that  Joe Hillings and I had during the GA meeting at the Woodlands. He requested a  one pager summarizing the project to be presented to the USG for its  inclusion in Bush's agenda, during the meeting that Chavez and Bush would  have during the Free Trade Agreement of the Americas Summit in Canada this  month. Lisa Yoho got involved later, and then Tom Briggs and his DC team. I  participated in the drafting of a previous document to the one you attached.  The US embassy has been informed, but perhaps kept on the side because we are  affraid that its involvement might backfire. The relationsahip between the  USG and Venezuela have been antagonistic due to OPEC's policies, and the  political leftist leaning of the Chavez Administration. We are selling this  project as a Venezuelan project, that will advance Venezuelan interests (more  than US interests), and so far has worked. I don't mean that the effort to  include this project in Bush's agenda will have the same fate, because the US  Embassy deals at lower levels and the message doesn't get to Chavez, who is  the real sponsor of the project. Lower levels, except people at PDVSA-Gas,  are in a neutral to slight opposition stance (recent changes in MEM and PDVSA  might have aligned these interests).

"Rick - Over the weekend we agreed to terms with PSE&G on a gas case  requestiung the transfer of pipeline capacity contracts.  In return for our  support, we obtained the following:  Two three year gas storage deals with ENA;  Three year Capacity Management, when Residential customers move to market  prices, (probably within two-three years);  5% Basic Generation Service when BGS market opens 8/02.  ENA is currently valueing the gas deals, however, my guess is they are worth  approximately $3-5 million.  The cap mgt deal will be worth approximately  $25-30 million, whiule the BGS will be a liitle difficullt to quantify at  this point.  There was also a general understanding with Steve Teitleman,  President PSEG Genco, to increase the business between ENA and PS, both in  power and gas.    I will forward the LOI when it is signed, probably within a few days.  As  always please call if you wish to discuss the details.

The results for day-ahead clearing markets have been bid gaming to  influence price in the day-ahead market.  In PJM and NY-ISO parties submit  false load and generation schedules in set price (most often this is a low  ball load estimate),then later the true load is scheduled.  I think there is  less of a problem with the hour-ahead market since the opportunity to submit  a false bid to set price and then replace it later is very limited if not  nonexistent.    >>> Unbalance Schedules   The general direction we are going for Eastern ISO's is to allow unbalance  schedules in the real-time market.  Tim indicated a few weeks ago that he  still wants this feature.  Normally there would be no imbalance penalties,  however, when reserve margins are so slim that the system's security is in  jeopardy, penalties would be triggered.  The result is that parties can  choose to use the real-time market or they can choose bilateral schedules or  a combination.  They are not compelled to do either.  As long as reserves are  adequate, then why should we care.  >>> Unit Commitment   Although not on your list, I think the primary problems that the Day-Ahead  Market is trying to solve is unit commitment.  While this may be the intended  purpose, it hasn't worked very well.  Centralized unit commitment would  address the problem, but then the operator decisions have a large impact on  prices without having any consequences.  We need a proposal for making sure  that resources will be on line and that the operator knows they will be in  place.  A possible approach may be as follows (as suggested by Mike Roan):  The Operator publishes its expected real-time price for the next 48 hours  based on information supplied by generators regarding their availability and  bid price (one part) and the ISO's estimate of hourly loads.  The estimates  roll forward every hour to that a continuous two day outlook is provided to  all market participants.  The Operator provides the demand/supply curves to  the market so everyone has the same information. As units are committed and load forecast is adjusted, the estimate of  real-time prices changes, providing signals for units to use in deciding to  commit units.  As expected price rises, more units are committed and price  goes down. At a given point in time, such as 4 hours ahead of real-time, the Operator  locks units in as committed.  If there are inadequate units committed, it  pays to add capacity (call contracts).  If not enough is voluntarily bid, the  Operator orders units on under emergency rules contained in  interconnection/integration agreements with the generators.  The cost of the call contracts or of units ordered on is included in the cost  of imbalance energy in real-time for the hours for which those costs were  incurred.  This procedure is a continuous bid type of approach, which provides signals  and information to the market.  It or some other procedure like it is needed  to address the Operators concerns that it will be able to operate the system  and to deal with the overly conservative tendencies of a not-for-profit ISO.

Give me or Sue Mara your comments and then we can turn it into message points  for  media / advocacy folks.  In addition to reviewing the plan, I listened in to part of a stakeholder  call that occured Friday 10 a.m. PST.  DRAFT MESSAGE POINTS:  With limited exceptions, the plan does nothing to increase supply or decrease  demand.  It primarily addresses costs and market ""stability""  INTERESTING QUOTES:   ""Over the edge into cost based regulation"" Duke Power  Although the plan provides for cost control and for improving market  ""stability"" (whatever that means), the ISO staffer (Byron Wortz) who  presented the study admitted it ""Will do nothing to increase supply this  summer""  A staffer, Lorenzo,  stated (paraphrased)"" all out of state suppliers are  cost of service based and do not need to recieve market based rates  ON SPECIFICS  The Ugly:  Resource-specific cost based bid caps (RSBC or bid caps):  cost of service  regulation that disincent supply The ISO will hold in-state resources hostage--cuts any exports when reserves  fall below a stated critera  Imports can only participate as price takers.  Thus if the highest-cost  in-state resource is below the opportunity cost of power, needed imports will  not come in:  >>this will decrease supply!!  >> Staffer stated ISO hopes to sign ""longer term deals"" if necessary to  secure out-of-state power but acknowledged the proposal needs more work.  The Bad:  The ISO is considering pay as bid, which is complex and does not increase  supply.  However, on the call they said they are leaing to a single price  auction.  However, with bid caps the market will still be distorted.  The Good?:  The ISO wll implement an hourly day-ahead and hour-ahead market, essentially  filling  a void created by the PX's demise.  >>( Enron has strongly advocated market seperation in the past but do we  want to consider supporting a day ahead market?)  Market separation rules (MSR).  ISO is leaning towards option 2 in which SCs  submit bundled schedules but that market seperation would be suspended after  congestion process is conducted; i.e., final schedules may be imbalanced.  >>What do we think of this? .

"Rick - As requested, please find attached my proposed budget reductions for  the remainder of this year.  Total reductions equal $168,000, which includes  $35,000 of the Tabors TCC rcr which was originally approved for $75,000.   I  also made a small cut in Travel of $10,000, but would be uneasy cutting  anymore since we were very thin to begin with in this area  I have however  reiterated to all of my staff, myself included, to spend each dollar as  prudently as we can.  At this point I am not recommending any reductions in  Staff, however, if things get real tight I may need to revisit the need for  Teri Miller in the Concord office.  Looking to the end of the year, I estimate the need for the following:  Florida - Retain Katz Kutter for the period July-December at $10,000 per  month.  Current agreement is $20,000 per month but ends in June 01.  Tabors New York/New England Support - Current rcr approved through April at  $31,000 permonth combined.  I expect that we can cut that to $20,000 per  month and will be putting in an rcr this week.    I hope this is all we need to cut!  Please advise if we need to discuss  further.

The PUC is looking for consultants who can provide information in the following areas:  1.    Impact of power outages on chemical processes 2.      Impact of power outages on biomedical processes.  3.    Impact of power outages at public events (and who understands current regulations with regard to ballparks).  The PUC is seeking to bypass the state contracting procedures and finalize contracts within the next few weeks.  They asked ORC for names of consultants with expertise in the above areas.  When ORC volunteered that power outages can have a significant impact on manufacturing operations as well, they thanked us for sharing but they are interested in direct impacts on health or safety.  If you have any suggestions for the PUC, please provide them to me ASAP; the PUC requested a response by April 16, 2001.  Thank you.      -- Elizabeth A.

"I may be too late, because I took a couple of days of vacation, but I will  still respond.  I think with adjustments and broadening, there should be a  proposal that Enron and Reliant could both support.    1.  Under Reliant's plan, the customer is selling a call option for  interruption, rather than a block of energy. This means the customer is not  planning ahead to shift production, but waiting for the call to be  exercised.  This doesn't do much for forward planning and it makes it  difficult for an industry to plan ahead.  Some customers who cannot live with  an interruption on call, can nevertheless move production on a planned basis  to another day, another factory, or even give up production for a period.    The best outcome is for the customer to be able to bid for either sale of a  preplanned block of energy or sale an interruptible call option.  This is the  broadening of the proposal I suggest.  2.  WSCC is the WRONG the absolutely WRONG place for the market to be  organized.  They have no experience or infrastructure for handling market  activity.  WSCC runs in terror whenever an economic issue is raised.  The  utilities have way to much voting power.  The list goes on.  Under WSCC the  proposal will be talked to death.  You need someone with infrastructure to  run a market.  Why limit this to one market or marketer.  The key is getting  the state tariff riders in place, then the utilities can place the orders  with whatever vendor offers the best price.  If a neutral site for posting is  needed, use APX or maybe even the WSPP bulletin board.  This centralization  in a single market is not helpful.

Read the  questions Sterba was asked at: www.scientech.com      [IMAGE]  [IMAGE] April 20, 2001  Deal for SCE's Transmission Assets Appears Dead on Arrival  by Will McNamara  Director, Electric Industry Analysis  [News item from Reuters] California Gov. Gray Davis' billion dollar plan to  save utility Southern California Edison (SCE) from bankruptcy is in deep  trouble and could be rejected by legislators. Legislative sources said the  governor was having so much trouble gathering support for his plan that he  could not find anyone to sponsor a bill. One Assembly official called the SCE  bailout plan ""the most unpopular piece of legislation in years.""   Analysis: Even when this deal was announced as an ""agreement in principle""  some 50 days ago, it seemed too far-fetched to be possible. The only party  that clearly seems to benefit from the agreement forged between Gov. Davis  and SCE is the cash-strapped utility. California energy customers appear to  get the short end of an expensive stick, while the state seemingly gains  nothing of value beyond what could amount to a whole new set of  administrative problems. Thus, despite the hype with which Gov. Davis  announced this rescue plan for SCE, California legislators-both Republicans  and Democrats-are saying  ""not so fast"" and appear to be collectively opposed  to the plan as it currently stands. As it becomes apparent that the  California Legislature will not approve this plan, the general consensus is  that Gov. Davis' offer to SCE is simply a financial bailout for the utility  that provides no benefit to California residents.   For background on the details of Gov. Davis' rescue plan for SCE, please  reference my IssueAlert from 4/11/01. In a nutshell, the state of California  agreed to buy SCE's 12,000-mile transmission grid, which covers much of the  southern half of the state, for $2.76 billion, 2.3 times the system's book  value. SCE would be allowed to use the proceeds to pay off its existing debt,  restoring it to financial stability.  Both the California Legislature and the  CPUC need to approve this deal by Aug. 15 or else the agreement is  terminated.   In the highly politicized climate under which the California energy crisis  has unfolded, it is imperative to understand the agendas that each  stakeholder possesses. For instance, keep in mind that Gov. Davis' political  career has been severely damaged by the state's energy crisis, and the fact  that Pacific Gas & Electric Co., California's largest utility company,  declared bankruptcy has only further tainted the governor's standing. Perhaps  more than any other goal, Davis wants to keep SCE from also filing for  Chapter 11 protection. In addition, Davis believes he will be better able to  solve the crisis if he assumes control over the state's transmission grid  (much like the state has assumed the role of a power purchasing agent).  Normally, a measure supported by the Democratic governor could be easily  approved by California's Democrat-controlled legislature. However, the energy  issue has divided support for Davis even within his own party. Consequently,  the governor needs the support of both Republicans and Democrats in order to  see his rescue plan for SCE pass.    For its part, there was very little reason why SCE should not have agreed to  the governor's terms. From multiple standpoints, the utility gains enormously  from the governor's offer, while at the same time it avoids lengthy and  costly bankruptcy proceedings. Under the agreement, SCE gains a method for  pulling itself out of debt, via rate increases that probably would be  implemented over the next 15 years. Further, its parent company Edison  International gets to hold on to a reported $4.8 billion that SCE has  provided to the corporate operation since 1997. (The exception to this is a  $400 million tax refund that Edison International would give back to SCE).  While Davis referred to his plan as a  ""good, balanced deal,"" some consumer  groups have charged that SCE ""has taken the governor to the cleaners.""   Meanwhile, California customers clearly lose in the deal because they would  be forced to ultimately pay for the $2.76 billion that the state needs to buy  the transmission assets. The state would purchase the lines with bonds that  would be paid off by transmission fees charged to SCE customers. It is  presently not clear whether or not those fees, which are already part of  monthly bills, would be sufficient; therefore, it is likely that rates would  be increased to support the purchase. In addition, the subtext of the deal is  that customers would ultimately pay to drive down SCE's debt, which was  accumulated as a result of unrestricted wholesale power costs charged by  generators. Consequently, California customers would bear the responsibility  for prices that FERC has at times deemed ""unjust and unreasonable.""   Ultimately, however, it is the California Legislature and CPUC that will have  the authority to approve the agreement between Gov. Davis and SCE. These two  agencies must ultimately decide if the plan is good or bad, and weigh the  impact for various stakeholders. Presently, the legislature in particular is  finding that there are many questionable aspects about the plan. For  instance, what value would there be in the California government owning only  one portion of the state's interconnected transmission system? PGOCorp. has  walked away from the negotiating table and has expressed little interest in  selling its transmission lines to the state. No agreement with Sempra Energy  (parent of San Diego Gas & Electric) has been reached either. Thus, if the  Gov. Davis / SCE agreement is approved, the state of California would gain  ownership rights to only a portion of the overall transmission system in the  state. Many legislators challenge the value of this, especially when it is  considered that most of the congestion that leads to higher prices within the  state is concentrated along PG&E's portion of the grid. The counter-argument  to this point is that, now that its utility is in bankruptcy proceedings,  PGOmay not have the choice of whether or not to sell its transmission assets  to the state. The bankruptcy judge would make this decision. Thus, some  argue, the state may have a better chance of obtaining PG&E's transmission  assets if it can first complete a deal with SCE.    The second fundamental problem is that causing California legislators to turn  their back on the governor's plan is what some have referred to as an  ""obscene bailout"" for SCE and its parent company. Some reportedly believe  that Gov. Davis rushed into an overly generous offer for SCE out of anxiety  caused by the breakdown in his communications with PG&E. As noted, the $2.76  billion offer for SCE's assets is about 2.3 times their book value, so many  legislators are having difficulty reconciling what appears to be an  inappropriate price tag (and, once again, a cost that taxpayers and  ratepayers would ultimately have to absorb). Currently, SCE customers pay a  FERC-approved transmission rate based upon a cost-plus formula. If the state  pays 2.3 times book value, it would equate to ratepayers paying two times  over for those same transmission lines. In addition, some legislators,  including former Democratic allies of Gov. Davis, have suggested that SCE  should be forced to enter bankruptcy as Pacific Gas & Electric Co. has done.  Naturally, legislators will approach the issue with their constituents in  mind, knowing that they will be accountable for how they vote on this plan.  Looking at the issue from a customer perspective, one could argue that SCE  declaring bankruptcy would create less financial hardship for California  customers than bailing out the utility and increasing rates. This will be a  major political challenge for California legislators to resolve if the  governor's plan becomes sponsored as a bill.   If I pull out my crystal ball and be so bold as to make projections in this  case, I would predict that there is little chance that Gov. Davis' rescue  plan for SCE will pass in its current form. The energy crisis in California  has become so politicized that legislators will be very reticent to approve  any measure that resembles a financial bailout for one of the utilities,  especially without obtaining something of value for the state in return. It  is Gov. Davis' personal agenda to obtain control over the state's  transmission assets, but I don't see this as being a priority for other  California lawmakers. Thus, the deal will be a tough sell unless some new  development occurs that puts owning SCE's transmission assets in the state's  best interest. Considering the many headaches associated with this business,  and the fact that the state has no expertise in this area, I don't see this  occurring. Consequently, the game is by no means over for SCE and its  potential for bankruptcy does not appear to have decreased to any large  extent. One large California utility is already in bankruptcy court. We could  be only days or weeks away from seeing SCE head in that direction as well.

The Interlata relief bill that will be introduced on Monday  or Tuesday by Congressmen Tauzin and Dingell will be nearly identical to last  year's bill, H.R. 2420.  Tauzin will hold a full committee hearing on the  bill next Wednesday with invited witnesses to include Verizon, Covad, Highway  One (a DSL carrier in NY) and McLeod.  We aren't aware of any administration  types being invited, i.e. Powell or someone from NTIA.  A subcommittee markup  will likely be scheduled for the following week, with the full committee  mark-up to occur sometime before Memorial Day, depending on what is happening  in the Committee with regards to the California situation.  On the Senate side, we are hearing that Senator Sam Brownback will  reintroduce his RBOC legislation from last year which is more of a RBOC  friendly bill than Tauzin's in that RBOCs would no longer be subject to  Federal requirements concerning facilities and equipment carriage of advanced  communications services.  We understand that Brownback intends to introduce  his legislation sometime before Memorial Day but that he is actively seeking  a Democratic co-sponsor, something that he was not able to do last Congress  either.  Opponents of the bill are working the Senate side to ensure he does  not find an ally.  We understand that Tauzin has kept in close contact with  his fellow Louisianan Senator John Breaux on the goings-on in the House and  that Breaux may be willing to help move things along in the Senate, however  as Scott stated previously, Senator McCain, as we know, is likely not to take  an active position on the legislation.  Senators Hollings (Ranking Member of  the Commerce Committee), Senator Stevens and Senator Lott are all said to be  against moving forward with any form of 271 relief.  Despite all of the  Senate activity, the bottom line is that Scott's assessment is accurate - we  don't see anything moving out of the Senate this year.

Billy Tauzin, Chairman of the  House Commerce Committee, is expected to introduce legislation on 4/23 to  enable ILECs to provide interLATA data services without opening their local  networks to competitors.  The bill would allow the Bells to transmit data  across local market boundaries and also allow the RBOCs to deploy  high-capacity facilities without having to lease or resell them as UNEs. Rep.  John Dingell, the Commerce Committee ranking member will be a co-sponser.  This bill last Congress had over 200 co-sponsors and made it to committee  mark-up, but was stifled by then-Commerce Chairman Tom Bliley and supporters  of AT&T.  This year, Tauzin is expected to push it through his committee  vigorously and it may come to the House floor for a vote.  However, the  Senate seems unlikely to take this up in a serious way this year due to Sen.  McCain's reluctance to follow Rep. Tauzin's agenda and Sen. Hollings' solid  support of AT&T.  We expect this legislation to create a lot of noise this  year, but not move through the Senate until next year if at all.

"The Texas statute allows for full collection of stranded costs with a final  determination of stranded costs in 2004 and interim collection in 2002 and  2003 based on a Commission estimate.  The Commission bases its estimate of  stranded costs on the ECOM (Excess Costs Over Market) Model.  The ECOM model  computes the difference between the revenues a utility would receive in a  regulated environment versus the revenues a utility would receive if it sold  all of its generation at market prices (the market price in the ECOM Model is  based on a Combined Cycle Combustion Turbine).   In 1998 the Commission estimated more than $4 Billion in stranded costs based  on the ECOM Model.  Because stranded costs are the difference between the  market value and the book value of utility generating assets, the Commission  ordered utilities to ""mitigate"" stranded costs by increasing depreciation of  generating assets.  The accelerated depreciation, came from two sources:   1. Redirected depreciation -- Utilities were allowed to defer depreciation  of their wires assets and increase depreciation on generating assets; and,  2. Application of Excess Earnings -- instead of decreasing utility rates the  Commission set a cap on earnings and directed the utilities to apply any  earnings above the cap to depreciating generating assets.  Because of the unexpected rise in natural gas prices the market price in the  ECOM model rose significantly above the weighted average price of the  regulated side which is weighted by coal and nuclear.  This caused the 2001  estimate of stranded costs to be severely negative.  Even more negative than  the amounts of redirected depreciation and application of excess earnings.  Enron argued at the Commission that because the estimate of stranded cost was  negative the accelerated depreciation was unnecessary.  Consequently, we  argued that the money spent on mitigation should be used to reduce wires  rates.  The utilities argued that they should keep mitigation until the final  determination of stranded costs in 2004.  The Commission ruled in Enron's  favor.    Sylvester Turner filed H.B. 2107 to address this situation, however, rather  than simply reducing wires charges, the bill as filed would reduce utility  rates making it more difficult to compete.  We are working to amend the bill  so that the credit for redirected depreciation and excess earnings goes only  to reducing wires rates and that any negative stranded costs beyond that  amount would be refunded directly to ratepayers.",richard.shapiro@enron.com,jean.ryall@enron.com,Summary of HB 2107,2001-04-23 18:34:00-07:00,received

"The PUCT ruled today that the utilities' excess earnings balance will be  credited to the wires...amortized over 7 years with 7.5% interest beginning  Jan 1, 2002.  (Trueup was not until 2004).  Utilities are unhappy however,  this is the direction the commission had indicated they were heading a few  weeks ago.  The excess earnings total over $6 billion dollars (new numbers  came out today).    I visited with Rep. Turner today after the commission's ruling, AECT set up a  meeting with him to cut a deal.  Our commitment with Turner is that he will  not harm the headroom created in SB 7 and subsequent PUCT decisions.  Turner  was not completely happy with the commission's order because he was hoping  for a larger refund check to rate payers.  Our amendment to HB 2107 (which  refunds the excess earnings to the wires) is in line with the commission's  decision.  When we signed on board with Turner, he said that if we stood with  him, he would protect our interest.  Thank you for letting us get on board  with him.  The IOUs are trying to cut a deal with him and because we stood  with him...our interest should come first (as he has stated).   During the HB 2107 committee hearing in March, Baker (TXU)  indicated that  excess earnings should be returned to the wires (in 2004 trueup).  (I am  getting the transcript of that hearing in the morning to confirm my memory).    In a hearing on Nov 8, 2000 at the PUCT, Shaeffer ( Reliant) testified ""We  believe that if we overrecover stranded investment, that we're going to  refund the dollars down to the book value"".  Of course he meant during the  2004 trueup, however, with the overcollection reaching $6 billion - and with  today's commission ruling - a refund of the overcollection before 2004 is  inevitable.    Chairman Wolens (off the record) indicated today that HB 2107 would go to  conference.  I think it is safe to infer he thinks the bill will pass the  House and move to the Senate.  Turner has worked the Black Caucus, Hispanic  Caucus and the Democratic Caucus.    Rep. Counts (West Texas Conservative D) stood with Turner at the press  conference along with Rep. Bailey and Rep. Hodge...each of them advocated for  a refund of the overcollection.  (At the press conference Turner stated that  he would drop his bill and wait until the 2004 trueup if the utilities would  agree to keep everyone's lights on until the 2004 trueup.) The bill is likely  to be heard on the House floor next Tuesday.  I did not provide comments/quotes to Fort Worth Star Telegram...they were  told I was at the Capitol at a hearing.  I am working on a formal statement  and gathering the support of other market participants with our interest to  sign on.  I will run that by you before anything goes out.   Thus far, Enron, Calpine, New Energy, Strategic,  and Excelon are willing to  publically support our amendment to HB 2107.  (Others are supporting it but  won't come out of the closet because they fear the utilities.) We are talking  to Shell on Friday.  (They got confused and are supporting the bill as  filed...which hurts headroom...they like our amendment but want to talk  Friday before supporting it.)

Only other comment:  I'm not sure that, technically/contractually, we entered  into transactions with the PX (in the same way that I don't think that folks  enter into transactions with NYMEX).  (See opening line of last paragraph.)    We have exposure to thePX based on our commercial activity that took place  through the PX, and that exposure depends on how the PX /FERC decide  particular issues.  In short, we have transactions with the utilities, and  exposure to the PX based on transactions that we entered into with other  counter parties via the PX market mechanism.  That said, seems to me that,  for the purposes of the disclosure, the language is fine---just want to raise  the flag. Might be useful to run it by Richard Sanders.  Hope this helps.

I'm preparing a full list of all the English-speaking trade journals  for your perusal, but in the meantime I thought I'd make a few suggestion of  how we can help you with this task.  1.  In my view, some of the most accurate and insightful coverage comes from  the FT Energy special publications unit.  They cover the whole of Europe  through a number of different titles.  Enron Europe has an online group  subscription to this series so I am arranging for you to receive a password  so you can access this site.  Most of the publications come out twice a month.  2.  My group is responsible for media monitoring in Europe.   The material  comes from a variety of sources and it is quite a challenge to process and  distribute it effectively.   I suggest that we put you on the distribution  list for all material that either specifically mentions Enron or that relates  to regulatory matters in Europe.    3.  We have a number of different PR companies working for us in our markets  around Europe and they generally provide media monitoring as well but this is  not normally translated into English unless there is something significant.   I suggest that we include you in the circulation for those pieces.   We also cover Japan, Australia and the Middle East from here.  Japan.   I guess Nick O'Day will send material to you direct.  We have a  daily translation service of headlines and significant longer pieces from our  PR agency in Tokyo. Australia.  I will send you what we get, but things are fairly quiet there at  present.  I know that Mark Schroeder was in dialogue with Paul Quilkey about  the status of Government Affairs but I don't believe the issue was resolved.   I would like to talk to you separately about this issue at some point, if you  have a minute. Middle East.  I am still trying to get on the circulation list for media  coverage as we effect the transition from John Ambler's group.  I plan to  talk to John about this when he surfaces from handling DPC issues next week.   In my experience, the key publication for this area is MEED - the Middle East  Energy Digest.  4.   I will send you a full list of English-speaking trades and highlight the  ones which I think you will find most useful.   I believe quite a few of them  are now available online.  Please let me know if I can help with anything else and perhaps we can get  together for lunch on your next visit.

California has gotten itself in a pickle partially because they have always looked at the market wrong - as California alone when it is really the West. It is like looking at the market for new automobiles ""West of the Mississippi"" - a pretty meaningless concept as cars are produced on either side of that artificial boundary, and are freely bought and sold across it. When you get the market definition wrong it is almost impossible to make head or tails of any situation - which the Cal ISO and Gray Davis's office have in fact failed to do.  The current proposal will generally fail - the market will just clear outside California. It only acts as a form of price discrimination against the California generators, who will then presumably sue for restraint of interstate commerce. There is no way there are going voluntarily to agree to be ""Participating Generators"" in the Cal ISO's scheme. So the entire market will become ""OOM"".  I think if the leadership had not been so abysmal on this there could have been a rational deal between the CA gov't and the generators that would have solved the basic problem, kept the lights on and minimized the economic damage to the California economy and the state's bond rating. But it hasn't happened, and Moody's now ranks California debt at 49th of the 50 states, only notch above Louisiana. This is going to cost California's citizens billions for years to come in higher borrowing costs, even for the normal expenditure of government such as highways and schools. Time for a timeout, and to regroup. Even the old regulatory process at the CPUC wasn't this bad...  Speak to you next week.

"Rick, do you have any concerns with the attached position I propose to take  here in Alberta? ---------------------- Forwarded by Robert Hemstock/CAL/ECT on 04/27/2001  08:23 AM ---------------------------          From:  Robert Hemstock                           04/26/2001 04:56 PM    To: Aleck Dadson/TOR/ECT@ECT, Harry Kingerski/NA/Enron@Enron, James D  Steffes/NA/Enron@Enron cc: Patrick Keene/NA/Enron@Enron, Susan M Landwehr/NA/Enron@Enron, Daniel  Allegretti/NA/Enron@Enron  Subject: Proposed Enron Canada Advocacy Position on Gas Utility Hedging  As I have previously advised, there is an AEUB hearing scheduled to commence  next week in Alberta that will address the issue of Atco Gas hedging the  price of its default supply offering to customers in Alberta.  I am trying to  finalize my instructions to our counsel on the position Enron Canada will  advocate in relation to utility hedging of default gas supply.   Atco is the primary gas utility in Alberta serving in excess of 90% of the  natural gas customers in the province.   Based on the terminology that was  recently used by Dan Allegretti and Sue Landwehr in their memo to Dave  Delainey of April 13, 2001 's I would describe the Alberta gas market as an  ""open access jurisdiction"" as Atco has existing transportation rates that  allow ""core customers"" (residential, commercial, and institutional consumers)  to purchase the commodity directly from a retailer.     For the purpose of this hearing it is beyond the AEUB's jurisdiction to  replace Atco as the default service provider by mandating the selection of  one or more default service providers through a competitive bidding process.   Also, in separate hearings the AEUB will be considering the issues of: 1)  more complete unbundling,  and 2) the treatment of natural gas production  assets that are presently subsidizing Atco's gas costs.    Given that Enron is in the process of reconsidering its position on utility  hedging and, more particularly, we have a vision of EES ""sleeving"" products  to customers through the regulated utility, I thought I better brief you on  the position I would like to advance in relation to Atco Gas being mandated  to hedge default supply for its core customers:   Atco should not be directed by the Board to use financial hedging to fix the  price of natural gas supply to its core default customers as this could  impede the development of the competitive retail market and/or delay entry of  new retail participants the development of a competitive and functional retail market is in the  interests of core customers.  With the entry of new retailers will come a  variety of new commodity pricing and term offerings  the pace of entry on new retail market participants should not be a function  of what will ultimately prove to be favorable or unfavorable hedging  decisions made by the incumbent default supplier (i.e. unfavorable hedging  decisions may actually accelate the development of a retail market subject to  this being impeded by the introduction of exit fees to mitigate the stranded  costs that may result from poor hedging decisions and subsequent customers  exercising choice).   it is adminstratively cumbersome and difficult for the Board to approve  hedged rates as it would have an obligation to assess and make determinations  respecting Atco hedging decisions.   commodity price choices should be made by the customer who will be subject to  the risks and benefits of this decision.  The decision should not be made on  behalf of all default customers by their default service provider the Board should focus its attention on the following two issues rather than  on mandating hedging: 1) directing more frequent (rather than seasonal)  default service commodity rate adjustments so Atco's actual monthly gas costs  are more closely reflected in its default service rates; 2) the upcoming  unbundling proceeding where the Board should ensure that unbundling  principles are adopted that will result in Atco's default supply commodity  costs not being subsidized by improperly functionalized costs from other  distribution business functions.  I apologize for the short notice but your advice on whether my position is  okay would be appreciated by tomorrow.

This is the presentation that the Brattle Group---a consulting group= =20 that Edison has long used on gas issues in California---gave last week to t= he=20 legislative committee investigating wholesale gas prices at the California= =20 Border.  The day following this presentation (which was followed by a=20 presentation by the California PUC's FERC lawyer), the committee called El= =20 Paso and Dynegy to respond to Brattle's and the CPUC FERC lawyer's=20 presentations.  Also attached is the best synopsis of the hearing that I've= =20 seen in the press.  Best, Jeff ***************************************************************************= *** **************************************************** Competing evidence clouds Calif. investigation  Prompted in part by the California Public Utilities Commission, the=20 California Assembly has been scrutinizing the role that interstate pipelines have played in the= =20 state=01,s current energy crisis. In the efforts to find a smoking gun, legislators have leane= d=20 heavily on a report prepared by The Brattle Group, a consultancy commissioned by utility= =20 Southern California Edison to dig up evidence of market power abuse.  But the state=01,s biggest transporter of gas to California -- El Paso Natu= ral=20 Gas -- is not ready to take the rap. The pipeline has commissioned its own study, which i= t=20 recently presented as evidence that it has not circumvented any laws or regulation.  As reported in both the trade press and national media, SoCal Ed and the CP= UC=20 are pointing the finger of blame at El Paso for alleged manipulation of California borde= r=20 prices through affiliate deals and capacity hoarding. And exhibit A in their case against = El=20 Paso is The Brattle Group=01,s study of the California market.  Richard Zeiger, a spokesman for Assembly Member Darrell Steinberg, chairman= =20 of the California Assembly Judiciary Committee, told Gas Daily that The Brattle=20 Group=01,s market study proved that the surge in gas prices at the California border was not= =20 caused by normal market forces (GD 4/20). His remarks followed an oversight hearing during= =20 which Assembly members questioned Dynegy and El Paso officials about their involvement in= =20 the California market.  El Paso presented a different version of events to the Assembly. In a repor= t=20 presented to legislators, a research group hired by El Paso concluded that a convergence= =20 of factors, not a conspiracy, caused the price run-up.  Lukens Consulting Group, a Houston-based consultancy, was retained by El Pa= so=20 to conduct work on several fronts. In its study of the California market, Lukens=20 concluded that the increasing convergence of the gas and electricity businesses was one of the= =20 main culprits in the California gas price imbroglio.  Assemblyman John Campbell, a Republican member of the oversight committee,= =20 said he ""didn=01,t see any smoking gun"" in either report.  ""We had our committee hearing, and we certainly had a lot on the Brattle=20 Study and a little on the Lukens study. To some degree, I=01,m not sure that the California=20 legislature is the best place to adjudicate the differences between these two studies,"" Campbell=20 said. ""I believe FERC is looking at this situation "" and it would seem to me that that=01,s the= =20 appropriate place.""  Campbell said that the CPUC had been prodding the California legislature to= =20 give support to its claims of market power abuse by pipelines. ""It=01,s being pushed=20 basically by the Public Utilities Commission here, which believes that there was collusion"" by=20 pipeline companies to push up gas prices in California, he said.  The CPUC, Campbell suggested, sought satisfaction before the California=20 assembly when it had failed on the federal level: ""There=01,s a concerted effort, not jus= t on=20 natural gas but on other things here in California, for entities and organizations here to point the= =20 finger elsewhere for the problems that we=01,re having in this state and I think you=01,re seein= g some=20 of that with the public utilities commission.""  Whether either report wins over the public incensed by high natural gas=20 prices is a different matter entirely. In the meanwhile, the dueling California market studies se= em=20 to have taken on a life of their own.  The Brattle Group Study, for instance, has become the center of a heavily= =20 litigated effort to force FERC to compel the release of market data by California market=20 participants. Following on a request by SoCal Ed, which said it needed additional data to round out= =20 The Brattle Group report, FERC Chief ALJ Curtis Wagner issued subpoenas to the other three=20 major pipelines that serve the state as well as to Sempra Energy Trading.  Several parties resisted FERC=01,s call for market information, saying the= =20 requested data contained commercially sensitive information. FERC allowed the discovery=20 process to move forward but only after attaching strict data protection rules restricting= =20 access to evidence (GD 4/23).  Critics of the pipeline industry have already suffered one setback in their= =20 case. The commission recently dismissed the CPUC=01,s claim that El Paso rigged the auction of a= =20 large block of pipeline capacity in favor of affiliate El Paso Merchant Energy. In=20 addressing the California Assembly, representatives of Dynegy said that FERC=01,s recent ruling on th= e=20 California border controversy obviated the need for more investigation.  The controversy, however, is far from over. FERC last month also ordered a= =20 hearing into whether El Paso Natural Gas and its affiliates manipulated capacity to driv= e=20 up the price of gas delivered into California (GD 3/29). That hearing is likely to take place= =20 this summer. (RP00- 241, et al.)

However, questions have arisen as to the calculation of the proxy price when  a stage 1, 2 or 3 emergency is called.  In initial discussions with FERC  staff, we have determined that the price mitigation will work as follows:  For the following day, the ISO will publish at 8 a.m. an average of the daily  prices published in Gas Daily for all California delivery points, as well as  emissions costs.  The emissions costs will be calculated by the ISO using the  Cantor Fitzgerald Environmental Brokerage Service.  The marginal unit will  then be determined via the single price auction in the hour, and the ISO will  then take the previously submitted and confidential heat rate data and  multiply it by the posted average gas price and emissions costs for that hour  to determine the market clearing price.  The ISO will not be calculating an  estimated market-clearing price in advance.

I believe that more strongly than ever, given the new markets we= =20 are entering, the enhanced focus of the company on markets and regions arou= nd=20 the world that best fit with our core competencies, and the phenomenal grow= th=20 of the company, perhaps best evidenced by the earnings report of the first= =20 quarter.  But, there are challenges as well: California, and its regional a= nd=20 global implications, and the general market conditions that have brought ou= r=20 stock price well off its recent highs.  With respect to each of these and= =20 other challenges, there are invariably opportunities: for example, the=20 enhanced opportunity for the FERC to finish the job of opening wholesale=20 electricity markets in the context of California; and, in the context of a= =20 lower stock price, a recognition that accelerated growth in earnings will= =20 bring the stock price to new highs in the not too distant future.  One way= =20 that earnings can grow beyond Wall Street expectations is by bringing a bit= =20 more discipline to how all of us spend money at Enron.  We in Government=20 Affairs can point to many efforts and processes that have been designed to= =20 instill that spending and resource allocation discipline in the last few=20 years.  We have always done our part, but there is always more that can be= =20 done.  To increase earnings and, correspondingly, the stock price, I recently met= =20 with various Government Affairs group heads to discuss ways Government=20 Affairs can do things better and more cost effectively.  We looked at group= =20 travel costs, outside services, and other budget items.  Attached for your= =20 review and use is a copy of a new Travel Policy and new Cell Phone Policy,= =20 which I believe, will ensure consistency across the group and deliver cost= =20 savings.

"PER VOICEMAIL. ---------------------- Forwarded by Richard Shapiro/NA/Enron on 04/27/2001 = 07:04 AM ---------------------------  Subject:=09FERC's 4/26/01 Order on California Price Mitigation  =20  If you read Ray Alvarez's summary from yesterday evening, open the attached=  Word document and read only the changes that we made to the summary since = receiving the final order, which was issued this afternoon.  Alan Comnes  =20  The full order is available at: http://www.ferc.fed.us/electric/bulkpower.h= tm  SUMMARY OF FERC'S ORDER ESTABLISHING PROSPECTIVE MITIGATION AND MONITORING PLAN FOR THE CALIF= ORNIA WHOLESALE ELECTRIC MARKETS AND ESTABLISHING AN INVESTIGATION OF PUBLI= C UTILITY RATES IN WHOLESALE WESTERN ENERGY MARKETS (Issued April 26, 2001)  Effective Date -- Price mitigation is effective May 29, 2001.  (ISO needs t= o have its day-ahead proxy price ready on 5/28)  Physical Withholding -- To prevent physical withholding, the plan will requ= ire sellers with PGA's to offer all their available power in real time to t= he extent not scheduled in bilateral trade.  All California generators, eve= n those not subject to FERC price regulation, will be required to sell into=  the ISO's real time market as a condition of their use of the ISO's inters= tate transmission lines. Hydroelectric facilities will be exempted. (This r= equirement to provide power is for all hours (24/7) for 1yr)=20  Price Mitigation - The plan will establish a single market clearing price a= uction for the real time market.  During Stage 1, 2 and 3 emergencies in th= e ISO's real time market, each generator (other than hydro) with a particip= ating generator agreement is required to offer all available power and bid = its marginal cost based on the generator's heat curve, emission rates, gas = costs and emission costs, plus $2/MWh for O&M.  The gas cost will be the av= erage daily cost of gas for all delivery points in California; emissions ar= e to be based on Cantor Fitzgerald Environmental Brokerage Services.  The I= SO will publish by 8:00 am, the gas and emission figures to be used for the=  next day in any hour where an emergency is declared. These figures (for th= e next day) will be based on the prior day's Gas Daily and Cantor Fitzgeral= d data. A single market clearing price is determined in real time for all g= enerators.  Highest bid sets the clearing price.  Each gas-fired generator = must file with FERC and the ISO within 5 days, on a confidential basis, hea= t and emission rates for each generating unit.  The ISO will use these rate= s to calculate a marginal cost for each generator, including maintenance an= d operating costs.  Generators that submit bids at or below the market clea= ring price will not be subject to refund liability.  (Although the followin= g qualification is made: ""However, all public utility rates will be subject=  to refund for violations of the conditions imposed on market-based rates, = discussed infra.""  Presumably this has to do with anomalous bidding behavio= r.)  In the event a generator submits a bid higher than the proxy price, th= e generator must, within 7 days of the end of each month, file a report wit= h FERC and the ISO justifying its price.  FERC explicitly acknowledges that=  some units may have gas costs that exceed the ""all delivery point"" index i= t has adopted. FERC has 60 days to review/act.  No opportunity costs in rea= l time.  Marketers are not held to any generator cost standard but must be = prepared to justify bid at purchased cost based on specific purchases or po= rtfolio with no opportunity cost. =20  Underscheduling Penalites -- FERC acknowledges that the there is a pending = request to revoke the current underscheduling penalty but indicates that it=  is still in place.  Thus, although it may be advantageous to wait to buy p= ower in R/T at capped prices, doing so may make the scheduling coordinator = subject to the currently effective $100/MWh penalty.  See p. 20 of the FERC=  order.  New Generation --  New generation is NOT exempted from the Commission's pri= ce mitigation measures.   Demand Response -- Beginning June 1, only public utility load serving entit= ies must submit demand side bids to curtail load and identify the load to b= e curtailed under those bids.  FERC is attempting to make the demand curve = more price responsive.  (This requirement is in effect for all hours (24/7)= ) =20  Outages -- PGA generators will coordinate planned outages and report forced=  outages The ISO is required to make a tariff filing within 15 days of the = order proposing a mechanism for coordination and control of outages, includ= ing periodic reports to the Commission.  Term - Order expires one year from date of issuance.  RTO Filing - California ISO and two Utilities must make RTO filing by June = 1 or Order lapses with no further effect.  The RTO filing is to be consiste= nt with the characteristics and functions in Order No. 2000.  ISO Reporting - On September 14, 2001, ISO must file a status report on how=  things are working and how much generation has been built.  Comments are d= ue in 15 days.  Quarterly reports thereafter.  Revocation of Market Based Rate Authority and Refunds - The market based ra= te authority of all public utilities is conditioned on (1) no physical with= hold of capacity, and (2) no inappropriate bidding behavior.  Inappropriate=  bidding behavior includes bidding unrelated to known characteristics of th= e generation unit or without an input cost basis or bidding not based on un= it behavior.  An increased bid based on increased demand could apparently b= e inappropriate.  In addition, ""hockey stick"" bids are expressly prohibited=  (i.e.  bidding 95% at marginal cost and 5% at a much higher level).  Other=  prohibited bidding practices identified include: pricing a single unit muc= h higher than other units in a supplier portfolio and changes in bids due t= o increased scarcity rather than changes in generator costs.  West-Wide Section 206 Investigation  - Opens a section 206 investigation co= ncerning the J&R of wholesale power in the WSCC other than sales to the CAI= SO market.    FERC requests comments on the scope and nature of price mitig= ation.  However its proposal is that refund conditions apply only in real t= ime (markets for power less than 24 hours in advance of R/T) spot markets w= hen contingency within a control area falls below 7% within a control area.=     FERC is attempting to mirror the rules applied in California.  Comments=  are due in 10 days on the 206 investigations.  Although it is still formul= ating its price mitigation plan for the non-California PNW, the FERC sets t= he refund effective date is 60 days from publication of the Order.  NOx Limits in California --  Must sell requirements do not apply if a unit = is prohibited from running by law.  However, it appears that incurring fine= s does not overcome the must sell requirement- just include the fines as pa= rt of the price bid.  Also if NOx is limited, may seek to show that generat= ion would have been sold elsewhere or at different times for determining pr= ice. =20  Surcharge to pay past amount due -- Comments are due in 30 days on (1) whet= her FERC should require the ISO to surcharge parties for payment into an es= crow account to pay past costs and (2) the effect this surcharge would have=  on the PG&E bankruptcy filing. =20  Treatment of the CAISO's Market Stabilization Plan (MSP). The FERC rejects = the CAISO's MSP saying that FERC's plan for market mitigation is sufficient= .  It expressly rejects CAISO's plan to create a day-ahead and hour-ahead e= nergy markets are expressly reject and tells CAISO to stop actions to imple= ment software changes to effectuate such markets.  Unfortunately, it does n= ot expressly reject CAISO's plan to cut exports.  In general, no mention wa= s made as to issue of exports of power from California although the stateme= nt that CAISO must become a real RTO would support the notion that CAISO mu= st honor firm schedules on its system..=20  Recap of Dates Identified in the Order ?=09Issue date: 4/26/01 ?=09Heat rate emission filing from generators due: 5 days (5/1/01) ?=09Comments due on WSCC-wide price mitigation: 10 days (5/6/01) ?=09ISO Tariff filing due: 15 days (5/11/01) ?=09Comments on ISO Tariff due: 5 days thereafter (5/16/01) ?=09Comments on whether Commission should allow a premium to recover unpaid=  generator bills: 5/30/01 ?=09Effective date of proxy prices: 5/29/01 ?=09Demand responsive bids from load serving entities: 6/1/01 ?=09Refund effective date begins:  60 days after publishing in Federal Regi= ster (late June?) ?=09First ISO quarterly report: 9/14/01 ?=09Comments on first ISO quarterly report: 15 days thereafter (9/29/01) ?=09Plan terminates: 4/26/02  RA  & GAC      <Embedded StdOleLink>","louise.kitchen@enron.com, greg.whalley@enron.com, john.lavorato@enron.com,   mark.frevert@enron.com",richard.shapiro@enron.com,FERC's 4/26/01 Order on California Price Mitigation,2001-04-27 10:05:00-07:00,sent

However, questions have arisen as to the calculation of the proxy price when a stage 1, 2 or 3 emergency is called.  In initial discussions with FERC staff, we have determined that the price mitigation will work as follows:  For the following day, the ISO will publish at 8 a.m. an average of the daily prices published in Gas Daily for all California delivery points, as well as emissions costs.  The emissions costs will be calculated by the ISO using the Cantor Fitzgerald Environmental Brokerage Service.  The marginal unit will then be determined via the single price auction in the hour, and the ISO will then take the previously submitted and confidential heat rate data and multiply it by the posted average gas price and emissions costs for that hour to determine the market clearing price.  The ISO will not be calculating an estimated market-clearing price in advance.

"FYI ---------------------- Forwarded by Nicholas O'Day/AP/Enron on 05/01/2001  10:56 AM ---------------------------   Nicholas O'Day 04/30/2001 12:01 PM To: John Sherriff cc:    Subject: EPower Regulatory situation  John, after two preliminary meetings with EPower project managers on  regulatory issues and several discussions with Carey, it is clear that a lot  of work needs to be done on the regulatory front for EPower. For a start, we  need to go back and address the fundamentals:  the implications of Japan's deregulating market on forward power prices  the permits required for construction and operation of power plants and  related facilities, and the time needed  to obtain those permits  the ability to access the transmission network at the preferred sites in a  timely and cost effective manner  Over the next few weeks, I will be undertaking a comprehensive regulatory  review and will develop a lobbying strategy to address each of the barriers  to timely development of EnCom's projects. Having said that, there is a real  possibility that the permitting process cannot be shortened within an  acceptable time frame, or that an assessment of forward power prices suggests  that under certain scenarios it would be uneconomical to proceed with  development of one or more of the projects.  Forward Power Prices. EPower is currently using a projected forward power  price for 2007 and beyond based on the price paid by TEPCO to IPPs in  1995/96. Deregulation is inevitable in Japan and international experience  suggests that a period of significantly lower wholesale power prices will  likely follow, particularly given that Japan is likely to be in generation  surplus until at least 2010.  Permitting. EPower has indicated that it recently discovered that the  permitting process for Aomori project will take 7 years to complete, without  a significant lobbying effort. Prior to that, EPower believed that permitting  would take 3 years. Again, EPower based the 3 year permitting estimate on the  estimates of bidders in the 1995/ 96 IPP program. However, most of the IPP  proposals involved repowering of existing plants which reduced the permitting  time. In addition, the IPP program commenced prior to the introduction of the  current environmental laws.      Transmission Access. EPower has said that Chugoku Electric advised them that  it will take approximately 10 years and in the order of US$200m to connect  the proposed Ube plant to the transmission system. In addition, we have  preliminary indications that Tohoku Electric are looking at a similar time  frame to connect the Aomori project to the grid.  We have already started to address the transmission access issue. EPower  acknowledges that it needs a better understanding of the dynamics of the  transmission system to address in a meaningful way the concerns raised by the  utilities on connection to the transmission system. Both EPower and Enron  Japan have sufficient primary information on the transmission system for  David Mason in the London office to develop a dynamic model. Armed with the  information from the model, together with a more thorough understanding of  the rules of connection to the transmission system, we aim to be in a  position to negotiate in a more meaningful way with the relevant utilities.  Project Valuation. These issues have a direct bearing on what I understand  EnCom's value proposition to be - to take first mover advantage in Japan to  build, own and operate power plants in Japan more efficiently than the  incumbents. After almost twenty months operating in Japan, it may be timely  for EnCom to review this proposition.  I have proposed to Carey that in conjunction with the regulatory review that  he arrange for a reassessment of Encom's projects using a robust and  objective approach with input from  Ariga (Domestic plant development),  Andy  Foote/ Ed Cattigan (International plant development) and Jane McBride  (legal). As part of that reassessment, I have suggested that EPower price the  typical risks associated with project development  - financing, construction,  commodity, operating, market, legal, regulatory and political risk with a  view to making a financial assessment of each project on a best case, worst  case and mid case scenario.   The aim is to lay all the development risks out now so that we can make an  informed decision on projects and quickly assess the implications of events  as they arise through the course of project development.  John, it would be good to talk about these issues prior to the EPower  conference call on Wednesday. Today is a holiday in Japan, but feel free to  contact me at home or alternatively, I will be in the office Tuesday.

"FYI - This is something a little different for me.  I discussed these  opportunities to Duran last month and they appear to have some juice.

Driving  out to Brookhaven, LI, to meet with Steve and me was really beyond the call  of duty.  Your efforts there and in Connecticut gave me a very good initial  idea of the opportunities we may have in these two locations.  My first pass look at the New Britain and Waterbury sites in Connecticut  suggest that they will certainly be permittable.  The support from the local  municipalities and the Governor which you described is encouraging.  My next  step on these sites is to get an indication internally as to how interested  Enron is, strategically and financially, in Connecticut power.  I know that  you want a statement of interest fairly quickly from us, so you can offer the  opportunities to other developers if we decline.  The Brookhaven site on Long Island also looks interesting, and we have  already stated our interest in New York power.  The good news and the bad  news of this site is that AEP controls a 20-acre site a half mile away from  it.  The good part  is that AEP has already initially identified the gas,  power, and water interconnections for this area, and shown that a power plant  is environmentally low impact here.  The bad news is that a second plant now  might exceed LIPA's and the local communities capacity for power.  My next  steps are to informally identify the transmission constraints.  I have  already talked to Dan Staines about this, and Monday we tentatively decided  to seek a meeting with Steve's contact at KeySpan the week of May 16th when  I'm back in New York.  Finally, we discussed hypothetically what The Vince Group's interest would be  in these sites, should we decide to pursue any of them.  You would be most  interested in being retained as the local facilitator for these projects,  which Steve agrees you are very capable of doing, with a success payment to  you upon deal closure, to reimburse you for bringing these sites to us.  I  will investigate internally if this is workable.  Tony, thank you again for your time and interest.  I will get back to you as  I complete my initial investigations in the next two weeks on these three  sites.

AES Suspends Brazil Investments US-based power company AES Corp. has put on hold plans to invest between US$2 billion and US$2.5 billion on energy projects in Brazil, alleging that= =20 the government=01,s policy on pricing is jeopardizing its operations. AES President Dennis Bakke, on a brief visit to Brazil, said the company suspended indefinitely its plans to build as many as 10 thermoelectric powe= r plants. Bakke criticized Brazil's electricity sector regulator Aneel for maintainin= g=20 an energy policy that charged what Bakke said were ``unrealistically low price= s=20 for consumers,'' forcing AES to carry the burden of rising costs. He said investments would remain on hold until the government came up with a solution. AES has already invested US$6 billion in Brazil, primarily in electricity projects, making it one of the country's top private foreign investors.  Energy Blackouts To Begin June 1 The government announced Tuesday that it will begin a policy of programmed blackouts starting June 1 as part of its energy rationing plan. Mines and Energy Ministry officials had at first hoped to delay any blackou= ts until August, concentrating first on a program to induce consumers to reduc= e energy use. The critical level of reservoirs in the country=01,s main=20 hydroelectric plants, however, forced Tuesday=01,s decision to accelerate the blackouts w= hich=20 will last until the end of November when the rainy season begins. The blackouts will occur in the Southeast, Central-West and Northeast regio= ns of the country. At the same time the government will introduce a program=20 providing incentives to consumers to reduce their energy use. The goal of the plan is= =20 to lower electricity consumption by 20%. Although the general outline of the rationing plan was announced Tuesday, t= he details have yet to be worked out due to differences between the government ministers who compose the National Energy Policy Council (CNPE). A new meeting of CNPE was set for May 23 by which time it is hoped that an agreem= ent will have been reached on how to implement the plan. The initial proposal from Mines and Energy was for a 15% reduction for industry, 20% for residences and between 18% and 20% for commerce. The ministries of finance, planning and development, however, asked for more ti= me=20 to consider the impact of the energy cuts. The principal concern among government officials is with the impact on the economy of the proposed blackouts. According to a study to be released toda= y=20 by the Get?lio Vargas Foundation, a 20% energy cut would slow economic growth = by 1.5% of gross domestic product and would have a direct impact on 850,000 jo= bs. Production costs for industry would rise 1.5%, government tax receipts woul= d decline by R$6.6 billion (US$2.9 billion) and Brazil=01,s trade deficit wou= ld=20 increase by US$1.6 billion, according to the study. The study=01,s authors also said= =20 there was no guarantee that the effects of the program would be limited to this year. Business leaders reacted with apprehension to the prospect of obligatory blackouts. Most defended a policy of separate reduction goals for each=20 industrial sector, sparing industries that depend heavily on electricity. The S?o Paul= o=20 State Federation of Industries (Fiesp) said that sectors who are major consumers = of energy such as steel should be exempted from any rationing. While details were lacking in the government=01,s plan, officials said that=  the administration of the energy cuts would be placed in the hands of local=20 utilities which would determine the locations and schedules for daily blackouts.=20 According to national energy secretary Afonso Henriques, a 20% reduction in consumpti= on would amount to a cut of six hours a day.

However, there are also some opportunities here, namely supporting Paul  Hennemeyer on a part time basis.

New York, May 8 (Bloomberg) -- Creditors of PG&E Corp.'s bankrupt Pacific Gas & Electric utility unit may be able to grab assets of PG&E National Energy Group, a subsidiary the parent had intended to insulate, PG&E told the Securities and Exchange Commission.      By February this year, PG&E had restructured National Energy Group hoping to isolate the new unit's assets. The structure allowed National Energy Group to get a separate credit rating and borrow funds without affecting other units.      In its filing, PG&E said creditors may try to link payments between the utility and the parent to $349 million in capital contributions that PG&E made to National Energy Group in 2000, including $250 million transferred in the fourth quarter. National Energy Group's investment grade credit ratings, which were affirmed following Pacific Gas's April 6 bankruptcy, were based on the assumption that the new structure insulated the assets.      ``Bankruptcy law is designed to scrutinize the transactions between the company and those with inside influence that took place before the bankruptcy filing,'' Elizabeth Warren, a Harvard Law School professor, said prior to the filing. ``You do that so creditors can be compensated.''      On Feb. 20, Moody's Investors Service gave the National Energy Group an investment grade long-term rating of ``Baa2.'' The ratings company said the company's legal structure and independent financing strategy protect it from PG&E creditors that may attempt to force a consolidation or bankruptcy.                      Insolvent Transfers       Under the federal bankruptcy laws, when a company that's insolvent transfers assets to a parent and gets less than fair value, the bankruptcy court can unwind the transaction. The court can also undo asset transfers intended either to defraud creditors.      PG&E said it couldn't assure that fraudulent transfer claims in Pacific Gas's Chapter 11 case wouldn't be successful. If any such claims do succeed, they may have a significantly adverse impact, the company said. PG&E said it thinks Pacific Gas was solvent when it made payments to the parent and that creditors hadn't been defrauded.      In some circumstances, bankruptcy judges can undo corporate restructurings. In this case, National Energy Group's assets could be lumped with its parent's and used to pay off creditors.      PG&E said such a combination of assets, known as substantive consolidation, ``is an exception rather than the rule.''      Another risk is the possibility that California regulators may try and rescind payments that PG&E made to National Energy Group, the parent said in the filing.      The California Public Utilities Commission began an investigation of intercompany payments between all parts of the PG&E corporate structure on April 3.      The filing disclosed that National Energy Group has more than $2.22 billion of short- and long-term debt, including debt to its parent, as of Dec. 31.      PG&E owns all the stock of the National Energy Group, which it used as collateral for a $1 billion loan arranged by General Electric Capital Corp. and Lehman Commercial Paper Inc. If PG&E defaults on the loan, control of the company would move to the creditors, which may cause a default under certain obligations of the National Energy Group, the filing said.  --Liz Goldenberg in New York (212) 893-3940 or lgoldenberg@bloomberg.net, and Jeff St.Onge in Wilmington, Delaware, (302) 984-3362 or jstonge@bloomberg.net, through the San Francisco newsroom, (415) 912-2980/gcb  Story illustration: For a graph of the Bloomberg PowerMatch Trading Index of Northern California power prices, see {PMATNPSP <Index> GP D <GO>}.

Re: Centralized unit commitment and your concerns.  A few things to think about. Here are a few options:  1) Have the ISO do it (you can also have ""bid-zero"" bilaterals if you want but the basic mechanism is the same). This effectively gives you PJM, New York, etc.  2) You can have the traded flowgates approach, with the flowgate rights needed to schedule. That way you get the right plants on in the right places, in theory at least. This might be interesting as a future development, but as we have previously agreed it is way too untested for us= e now.  3) You can have the transmission rights (e.g flow rights a la Alliance) be purely financial hedges (similar in some ways to FTRs), but you don't need the flow right to schedule a transaction. This is the way that a bunch of the RTOs seem to be going (e.g. Alliance). But this still leaves you needin= g a way to create that feasible schedule. You can get feasibility by RT through the LMP but my sense is that the RTO needs to make sure there is enough capacity ready so that reliability can be protected. The problem of the financial-only flowgate method in my book is that it doesn't meet one o= f the key characteristics of a workable market - e.g. it doesn't really solve the problem of congestion while there is time to do anything about it (e.g. bring more plants online other than a few CTs, hydros, etc.). The RTO will need some way to handle this problem, or else handle large volumes of MWh b= y OOM calls at its discretion. I don't think we like that.  I was talking with some people about Alliance on Monday and they seem to have sort of lost track of the ball, at least in my book. They are now talking about an alternative method for dealing with day-ahead congestion. This would effectively take the form of the re-dispatch type process used i= n California. My view is that this sounds pretty clumsy, adds a lot of complication, and will be great fun for the big generators in Alliance. Under this system I want to be AEP - the 600 pound gorilla of the region. And it is still effectvely centralized - the ISO takes in inc/dec bids and broadcasts out prices, calculated by the OPF model. It has all of the elements of LMP, just done more than once. If I am a big intergrated generator/load utility with market power I can repeat the old games of creating congestion by my scheduling in a constrained area and then getting paid to unwind it.  So I think we have some basic questions to address next week on the call. I just want to make sure we get an RTO model that can be made to work without too much duct tape and bailing wire. If we want to jump off the centralized unit commitment train we may need to go back and consider all of the economic angles quite carefully. I am generally sympathetic to the decentralized commitment idea but I also want to make sure we don't end up with a muddle.

France and Belgium (Bruno Gaillard + 0.5 * Research Assistant) now join  Netherlands under Peter Styles to capitalise on previous PS involvement in  those countries. 2. Brussels-based continental gas resource Brendan Devlin (who may now not  join) has been split in 2 : one London-based resource under Doug Wood working  on continental gas and one Brussels-based resource under Peter Styles as  second base on EU. 3. Andreas Wagner (Enron Wind) affiliated with Paul Hennemeyer pro tem.  because of linkage on German environmental issues. 4. Jan Haizmann (currently EBS regulatory) may become freed up from Far  Eastern broadband to assist on German and EU competition issues. 5. Correction of minor errors : Frankfurt manager, assistants, other  appointments in the pipeline omitted in previous version.  Space allocation  Professional staff will integrate with commercial teams in a combination of  permanent desks / hot desks.  The immediate requirement is for 6 desks in  Richard's area and 5 in Eric's.  This will increase as G&R Affairs vacancies  are filled.  We'll provide detail to relevant assistants.  To free up maximum number of desks on 1st floor, some space could be reserved  on 5th floor next to PR for other G&RA requirements (assistants, govt affairs  library, extensive paper files, hot desks at peak times / ""quiet desks"" for  reviewing legislation, licences etc).  This can be reduced over time to the  extent library can be digitized and assistants found space among commercial  groups.  Alternatively, if space pressures on 1st floor are increasing, G&RA  staff can regroup on 5th floor and free up desks on 1st for commercial staff,  as before.  Precise requirements will be worked out with Toby Knight.   ",richard.shapiro@enron.com,paul.hennemeyer@enron.com,Gov & Reg Affairs organisation and space,2001-05-09 12:27:00-07:00,received

We have three big cases working during the summer and fall. Constellation is doing their retail/wholesale separation into two separate companies. Pepco and Conectiv are merging. Pepco's divestiture sharing will be much messier than we thought because we believe they are overcounting their transition cost (which subtracts from the share of the plant sale proceeds going to customers) by quite a few millions of dollars. All that and the ongoing workgroup process I need to get going on universal service and other low-income issues will keep us busy.

Thanks, Lisa ----- Forwarded by Lisa Yoho/NA/Enron on 05/08/2001 10:44 AM -----   BHafner@PGFM.com  05/07/2001 03:32 PM        To: Lisa.Yoho@enron.com, dan.lyons@enron.com    cc: rbelanger@pgfm.com, lyang@PGFM.com    Subject: Importer of Record  Lisa and Dan (and Tim):  Dick Belanger and I talked about the importer of record question we discussed in this morning's telephone call.   For a trading company such as Enron, that is importing products made by other companies, there is not much advantage to being importer of record.  The one legal advantage is that the importer of record can challenge actions taken by the US Customs Service, such as misclassification or valuation issues.   There do not appear to be other legal rights that Enron would sacrifice by not being importer of record.    However, the issue may not be whether Enron should be the importer of record, but whether it can avoid being importer of record.  Particularly in today's steel market, other parties may not be willing to be importer of record for exactly the reason Stelco indicated -- no one wants to expose themselves to the possibility of antidumping duties.   Thus, although Enron could structure a deal in which, for example, Stelco sold to Enron Canada, and Enron sold the steel to a US customer, with that customer acting as importer of record, with the possibility of a o201 investigation and/or AD/CVD cases lurking on the horizon, the customer may not be willing to expose itself to the possibility of future AD/CVD duties, and hence would be unwilling to act as importer of record.      If Enron can find someone else who is willing to act as importer of record, you would protect yourself better by structuring the deal that way.   The question is whether you can find someone to be importer of record.  Feel free to call if you have any questions.

In terms of who the Mayor should meet with while he is in Houston, I feel we  should ask a senior representative of the company to host him on a tour of  the trading floor.

The Directorate General for Competition of the European Commission (DG COMP) recently said it has been investigating several long-term take-or-pay contracts for over a year to make sure that destination clauses fall in line with European Union (EU)  competition laws.  * The abolition of territorial restriction clauses would be a prelude to more widespread renegotiation of long-term take-or-pay contracts and would bring genuine competition in European gas markets.  * In parallel with the pressure from the competition authorities, new commercial opportunities appear to be opening up, notably in the  Mediterranean, bringing further pressure to bear on the destination clauses.   **end**  Follow the URL above for the complete report.

"As discussed with you last week, Governor Pataki is holding a fundraiser for  his reelection campaign in Houston on Monday, June 4th. (His current terrm  expires in 2002.) According to the fundraiser organizing this event,  Elizabeth Blakemore (713-526-3399), there will be a reception from 5-6:30  p.m. at the home of Judy and Jack Holmes in River Oaks, followed by a dinner  at 7 for approximately 20 people at a location to be determined. Governor  Perry will be attending the reception, but not the dinner. All proceeds from  the fundraiser will go to the Pataki campaign. Tickets to the dinner are  $5,000.00 per person.  When I spoke with Blakemore last week, she indicated that the event was being  chaired by Bill Wise from El Paso, but she was willing to figure out a way to  get Ken or Jeff equal billing. She indicated that they do not yet have a  location for the dinner and suggested that it might be hosted in Ken or  Jeff's home. She also suggested that if we were willing to commit to $25,000,  we should be given co-chair status and would check with Pataki's office to  confirm that. I spoke with Blakemore today (5/11) and she confirmed that we  would definitely be given co-chair status for a $25k contribution. (She noted  that there may in fact be one or two others as well.)   I recommend that we co-host the event. As Rick correctly noted, we don't have  much of a relationship with Pataki, and this would give us a chance to begin  to establish closer ties with him. As you may be aware, NY law limits  corporate donations to NY candidates in any one year to $5,000.00 in the  aggregate. However, every individual corporation is allowed to make a  separate $5,000.00 contribution.   For the time being, I asked Blakemore to use me as her contact person. But it  makes sense to get her hooked up with someone in Houston. Let me know how you  want to proceed.",richard.shapiro@enron.com,howard.fromer@enron.com,Houston Fundraiser for Gov.

"Rick:  Regarding this call tomorrow: are you going to be on this?  I gather from Jim there is a lot of worry about saying anything about how the unit commitment process works (if it is in a centralized fashion). That's fine, but I just wanted to get your own views on this. I wrote this in response to the idea that we were looking for something quick and effective to put in ASAP. The closer the parallels to working markets (e.g. PJM) the better. That to me means following the PJM model fairly closely, and not diverging into other tracks on the RTO process. However, I see how people like Sue Mara are going to be very upset about this.  We can develop some other options (and they are being proposed in many of the RTO debates around the country), but I don't want us to end up advocating things that either won't work, are very complicated to design and implement (e.g. the California system, with re-dispatch iterations etc.), or just plain don't make sense. I guess the next question is how to present this to Steve Kean.  Anyway, as tomorrow's call seems to be controversial it might be useful to have a chat first.

The rates are not much  lower than what we filed for, and represent a very significant increase over  the previous rates.  The tariff methodology and revised regulations, put into  effect by the Supreme Decree, were followed to the letter by the regulator  despite political pressure to arbitrarily keep rates down.  The deliverables  here were to (1) obtain a tariff methodology via Supreme Decree that would  make the company finance-able / rescue it from dire financial straits and (2)  file a rate case and prosecute it to obtain hard rates in accordance with the  tariff methodology.  This second deliverable has now been completed.   Transredes has had a bond issue pending since last year due to the  uncertainty about rates; it is my understanding that the financial market  loved the ruling and that Transredes sold $40 million worth of bonds in about  5 minutes!  This ruling should also significantly increase Transredes's  market value, relative to Enron's efforts to sell its interest in the company.  ---------------------- Forwarded by Ray Alvarez/NA/Enron on 05/14/2001 11:38  AM ---------------------------  Doug Farmer 05/11/2001 06:09 PM  To: Peter E Weidler/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT,  Hansvander.klink@shell.com.br, Hans.h.vanderklink@si.shell.com cc: Jan van den Berg/TRANSREDES@TRANSREDES, John  Naphan/TRANSREDES@TRANSREDES, Cyro Camacho/TRANSREDES@TRANSREDES, Pedro  Elio/TRANSREDES@TRANSREDES, Fernando Gonzalez/TRANSREDES@TRANSREDES   Subject: Tariffs Approved  Gentlemen,  I am delighted to report that SIRESE approved substantial increases in TR's  tariffs consistent with the Law and Regulation.  The details are :-       Existing Tariff SIRESE Approved % Increase TR/CLHB Proposed TR/CLHB %  Increase  Gas Export (including surcharges)  $0.18  $0.2205  22.5%  $0.26 (excluding  RG)  44.4% Liquids Domestic    $1.05  $2.46  134.3%  $3.25    209.5% Liquids Export     $1.55  $2.31  49%  $3.35    116.1%  CLHB's tariffs were also approved as follows $1.19  $2.20  84.9%  $3.528     196.5%  As you can see we did substantially better than CLHB (comparable with our  liquids domestic) !!  We will get a detailed report on the assumptions used by SIRESE to reach  their conclusions on Monday, but our inteligence suggests the following :-  1. Export gas volumes increased to 100% TR capacity, and 100% GSA + Cuiaba 2  assumed for SDA and TEMIN purposes 2. RG Compresion project deleted 3. Interest rate reduced to 10 or 10.5 % i.e. the rate in our bond issue 4. Liquids expansion in the South reduced 5. Some continuity of service CAPEX reduced 6. Unknown OPEX reduction and maybe a change to the OPEX allocation between  concesions 7. OCC in service date slipped from 2003 to 2004. 8. Debt/Equity assumption changed from 60/40 to 70/30  Our strategy to respond to each of these points is as follows :-  1. Volumes.  Covered by 8% rule, we can blete but can expect little back  here.  Clearly we will appeal if volumes exceed installed capacity in the  short term i.e. 2002/2003. 2. RG Compression - not worth fighting for since we don't even have the  support of BG 3. Interest Rate - We'll get this back when we do a tariff  revision and  actual rates are used.  When we get the detail we will appeal if Jan feels we  have concrete grounds i.e. commision costs etc. are omited. 4. Liquids Expansion in the South.  Here we intend to do a detailed analysis  of exactly what has been deleted and as a result what liquids/gas production  will be shut in.  If possible all assumptions to be agreed with the affected  producers (PB, BG, Vintage and Chaco).  We will then write to those  producers(copy SIRESE , VMEH etc.) stating that on their recommendation the  project scope was reduced by SIRESE.  We will give them an estimate of the  lost liquids/gas production (in both volume and cash terms) resultant from  this decision.  We will tell them that since they proposed these reductions  we have no intention of appealing them but invite them to appeal. 5. Continuity of Service Capex.  We need to see the detail here.  We will  take the moral high ground and be absolutely clear that we are not prepared  to compromise our safety and environmental standards.  We need to see exactly  what has been removed, but my thought is that if that means we are unable to  provide some services (e.g. LPG transportation) or the continued operation of  some liquids laterals, we should write to those producers affected suggesting  that if they wish these services to be continued they need to appeal the  decision.  Again since this is Capex we will get it back in the end on tariff  revisions as long as the expenditure is approved on an annual basis in the  SIRESE budget process. 6. OPEX - need to see the detail on Monday. 7. OCC - will not appeal - we need to do a detailed study to develop an OCC  strategy. 8. Debt/Equity ratio.  Strictly speaking what has been done is in accordance  with the Law/Regulation - the regulation says the maximum allowed equity is  40%.  However, we have very strong grounds to appeal since : a) we are  currently miles away from 60/40 let alone 70/30, b) we can only borrow for  CAPEX (as per bond issue and the policy of all/most banks/lending  institutions) with the case presented in the rate case if we borrow to cover  100% of CAPEX we can easily demonstrate that we are still miles away from  60/40.  We intend to fight this one very hard using all the  external/independant help we can get.  As you are all aware our big exposure with the rate case was that the much  needed substantial increase in liquids tariffs would not be approved and we  would be subjected to some form of arbitary cut.  This has not happened  SIRESE has now approved and hence owns these substantial increases.  Having  got the big hike our job is now to claw back as much as we can from the above  strategy in the full knowledge that the results of these efforts will be much  smaller and hence managable increases.  Attached is an analysis of the individual impacts on the tariff of the above  points and the corporate model using the new tariff with our volume  assumptions (i.e. the worst case).

These estimates are for Enron budgetary purposes only, and do not represent a commitment or a ""not to exceed"" figure for Goodin, MacBride.  The actual fees incurred may exceed these estimates, and GMSRD will bill Enron on a hourly fee basis, as opposed to the retainer mechanism used in the first part of this year.  1.  Direct access legislation:   This involves working on a continuing series of bills related to direct access.  I cannot estimate a specific amount for the entire legislative project, it depends on how long it takes for the legislature to enact significant direct access legislation.   My best estimate is $8,000 per month, or $24,000 over three months.  The estimate would increase if direct access is still at issue in the session's last month--August.  As of May 11, 2001, we have recorded approximately $3000 in billings related to direct access in this month.  2. Improved powerplant siting and increased emission offset legislation:   $15,000 over three months, more if the final legislative solution is delayed until August.  We have recorded approximately $1,000 in billings related to this area this month (through May 11, 2001).  3. Windfall profits tax bill:  This project required additional upfront legal research regarding the constitutionality of the proposed tax.  We have billed legal fees for approximately $4000 in May, 2001, up through May 11. My best estimate is $18,000 over three months of session, more if the bill is still alive in August.  4. Global settlement/Edison MOU/Plan B legislation:   This project covers the gamut of comprehensive legislative proposals to address the energy crisis, including a proposal by the Governor, legislation to approve the Edison MOU or an alternative plan which does not involve purchase of the Edison transmission system, commonly referred to as ""Plan B"".  As explained by Paul Kaufman, this work is expected to involve less work in the near term, and more as the legislation actually moved forward in the future. Trying to average this increasing level of work over time is difficult, but I am estimating $15,000 over the next three months, more if the package is still being enacted in August.  We have recorded approximately $2000 in billings on this issue through May 11, 2001 this month.  Please contact me if you have any questions regarding any of the above.  We are pleased to have the opportunity to be of service to Enron, and look forward to continuing this relationship.

"Rick, thanks for the note. I will be in touch with you and Stefan Diescher on  this. The issue I have been faced with, however, is  simply this: I am covering power and gas for three countries on my own. The  demands on my time have been enormous and I have given Viviana as much of my time as possible. Indeed, at the last PRC, there was  significant pressure to place her in the ""has issues"" category and I resisted on the grounds that she needed more time to find her stride.  We have had a number of long meetings where I have noted in detail what my expectations are and provided her with suggestions on how  to improve. This has included helping her outline a research paper how to write a slide presentation, what research sources to go to, how to  extract information from people on the phone. In a better world I would spend more time with her to bring her along, but I am horribly  stretched and need a researcher who is more effective to help me get the job done. I have also gotten other feedback (including from the  head of the Frankfurt office) that has been rather negative. My view is that rather than prolong the mutual agony, we should begin the  process of managing her out and helping her secure more appropriate employment outside the firm.

My comments more or less in the order of your spreadsheet:  - Manager for German speaking countries; my view is that though we may feel  dispirited by lack of recruitment success and have resolved to get short term  help to Paul in the shape of some time from Jan Haizmann, we should not  abandon trying to fill the position. While we may identify an analyst or  associate capable of taking a G&RA rotation on Germany, the level at which  such a person could operate and the potential period of availability may be  severe constraints. I'm sure the other three of us will be willing to  reinforce Paul H's exposure to the demanding recruitment process. Sophie had  some creative ideas for sourcing.  - Brendan Devlin; he started today. Doug and I have agreed that pro tem he  does about two thirds continental gas and one third EU other businesses/  topics. Action was for you or Sophie to check on his documentation, let Doug  and me see his contract and see whether Brendan has filled in and submitted  medical questionnaire.  - Wilke and Charman; I think Doug and I regard them as C&EE candidates not  continental gas. I hope Doug will anyway co-ordinate our reversion to each of  them post-interview with you. He knows my views.   - Manager for EU; this position does not necessarily have to be located in  Brussels and is as much pan-European in nature as strictly EU; need to fill  it will depend partly on Brendan's future balance of work, partly on Nailia  Dindarova's development, and partly on evolving demands on us from  continental power, industrial and global markets, a prospective renewables  business, NetWorks etc. I am interested in evaluating candidates as they pop  up, but concerted recruitment effort and precise job description on hold.  - Unmentioned issues: Jan Haizmann's PRC process formalities and David  Gonzalez' future with us need to be resolved (former faster than latter!)  Also I forgot to mention on Monday that we have found a temoporary research  assistant for Teun van Biert: Mabel Pigmans; I have asked him to call you  about her contract - it will probably be best arranged under Dutch law as a  service agreement through one of our law firms there.

Lisa ----- Forwarded by Lisa Yoho/NA/Enron on 05/17/2001 11:24 AM -----   Chris Long  05/17/2001 10:54 AM        To: Linda Robertson/NA/Enron@ENRON, Lisa Yoho/NA/Enron@Enron    cc:     Subject: Rockefeller on Steel   No. 96  Thursday May 17, 2001 Page A-25   ISSN 1523-567X  Regulation, Law & Economics    International Trade Rockefeller Asks Senate Finance to Act Against Steel Imports Under Section 201  Sen. John D. Rockefeller (D-W.Va.) said May 16 that he has asked the Senate  Finance Committee to take action that could prompt the United States to  restrict imports of steel from other countries--a move likely to be supported  by the second-ranking Republican on the committee but opposed by its  chairman.  Saying he is running out of patience with the Bush administration,  Rockefellor told reporters he has asked the committee to urge the U.S.  International Trade Commission to begin an investigation into the cause of  rising steel imports, which could result in President Bush's temporarily  imposing import restrictions against the European Union, Japan, South Korea,  and other countries under Section 201 of the 1974 Trade Act.  ""I've written the Finance Committee,"" he said, ""asking for the initiation of  a Section 201.""  Earlier this month, Rockefeller wrote President Bush asking him to initiate  an ITC investigation under Section 201, noting that several U.S. steel  companies had reported substantial losses in the first quarter of this year.  ""I am writing to let you know that we are in a do-or-die situation,""  Rockefeller wrote. ""Failure to act now will be deadly. ...[T]he only  immediate relief for the steel crisis is for you to initiate action under  Section 201.""  Rockefeller said May 16 he also plans to introduce broader legislation May 17  aimed at providing relief to the U.S. steel industry. He did not rule out  eventually attaching the measure to the tax bill now working its way through  Congress but said, ""Let me get it introduced first.""   Bush Nominee Notes Possible Action  Earlier May 16, President Bush's nominee for a deputy U.S. trade  representative slot, Peter Allgeier, said at a confirmation hearing of the  Senate Finance Committee that the Bush administration was looking ""very, very  seriously"" at possible action under Section 201.  ""I would like to assure you that [the administration is] looking very, very  seriously at the issue of a possible 201 as part of our response to a very  urgent problem,"" Allgeier said.  U.S. Trade Representative Robert B. Zoellick has provided members of Congress  with similar assurances on several occasions since taking office earlier this  year. On May 10, for instance, he told a House Appropriations subcommittee  that a decision on possible Section 201 safeguard action should be made  ""within a matter of months or sooner.""  For his part, Sen. Charles F. Grassley (R-Iowa), who chairs the committee,  said he would be ""reluctant"" to support committee action on the issue.  ""I would be reluctant to do that,"" he said. ""I think our committee ought to  be seen as honest brokers in that effort.""  Grassley told reporters he has been approached by ""outside interests"" that  have urged him to back a committee request to the ITC on steel imports.  ""My message to them has been to work through the administration or file your  own private action,"" he said.  Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah), ranking Republican on the committee, said he  would ""probably"" support Rockefeller's plan for the committee to  ""self-initiate"" action under Section 201.  ""I don't want to be unfair to other countries,"" Hatch told reporters, ""but I  sure as heck don't want them to be unfair to us either. ... I want the  administration to be on notice that we're watching them.""   Senate Letter on AD, CVD Laws  Grassley, meanwhile, told reporters he did not sign the letter from 61  senators to President Bush earlier this month saying they will oppose any  international trade agreement that would weaken U.S. laws aimed at protecting  the U.S. market from unfair imports or unexpected import surges because a  ""worldwide discussion"" of antidumping practices, for instance, ""would benefit  the United States more than it would benefit other countries.""  He said he opposes efforts being made by some members of Congress to require  the Bush administration to ensure that U.S. antidumping and countervailing  duty laws were ""off the table"" in multilateral trade negotiations under the  World Trade Organization.  ""I don't think we have anything to fear having it on the table,"" Grassley  said.  Some countries, such as South Korea and Japan, argue that U.S. trade laws  have been used for protectionist purposes and have proposed revisiting the  issue in the WTO.  Allgeier, meanwhile, said that U.S. trade laws actually promote trade  liberalization.  ""American manufacturers, farmers, and workers will feel more confident with  trade negotiations if they feel that they have recourse to address these  unfair trade practices by our trading partners,"" he said. ""And so we do not  have any intention of weakening U.S. trade remedy laws in our negotiations.""  Allgeier said that the United States cannot prevent other countries from  bringing up the issue in trade talks.   Little Progress Made on TPA  Grassley also told reporters May 16 he hopes that the Senate Finance  Committee will be able to consider and approve legislation next month to  renew the president's trade promotion authority, formerly known as ""fast  track."" But he said that little progress has been made in discussions between  his staff and the staff of Sen. Max S. Baucus (D-Mont.), the ranking Democrat  on the committee, particularly concerning the contentious issue of labor and  environmental protection in the context of trade agreements.  ""Our staffs have been talking on a very regular basis,"" Grassley said, ""but  that's not to say that there's been progress made.""  He said, however, he was still hopeful that the legislation could be cleared  by the end of June, then approved by the full Senate before the next  ministerial meeting of the World Trade Organization, scheduled to be held in  Qatar Nov. 9-13.  Also testifying at the Finance Committee hearing on May 16, President Bush's  nominee for U.S. ambassador to the WTO, Linnet F. Deily, said that if  confirmed, she plans to begin meeting immediately with representatives of  other WTO member countries in Geneva-- ""hoping to build relationships based  on trust and candor.""  ""I look forward to working with other WTO members to try and find common  ground or reconcile our disparate positions, while always representing the  strength of the U.S. position,"" she said. ""I would like to understand other  perspectives while being a forceful advocate for our U.S. positions.""   By Gary G.

"Rick: IPPNY's new Executive Director, Gavin Donahue, has personally solicited  each of IPPNY's Board members for a contribution to IPPNY's PAC, which has a  balance of $1,000. Donahue came to IPPNY last month from a very senior  position in the Pataki administration (#2 person at the State Dept of  Environmental Conservation and part of the Governor's inner circle), and can  be extremely helpful to us as we pursue some project development  opportunities in the State. I thought it was important to cultivate a  relationship with Donahue and given that we have made similar contributions  to IPPNY in prior years (most recently in 1997 or 98 I think), spoke to Steve  Montovano about this request. Steve agreed that it made sense and could be  funded out of the $5k budgeted for NY. Based on that conversation, I've  already spoken to Donahue and indicated that we would contribute something.  While I recognize that IPPNY is largely dominated by the generators, we do  have some influence as a Board member and by virtue of just being Enron. I  would not like to see us squander our ""first impressions"" with Donahue and  undermine his new credibility as an organization head by denying him the  funds to allow him to appear as a player in the political fund-raising  circuit.

"Steve Kean and I believe quite strongly, within a four peer group structure,  that we need to allocate somewhere between 30 and 50 percent of Gov't./ public  Affairs out of commercial support into specialized technical- there is a clear divide between individuals in the Gov't/public  Affairs groups  who are managing significant risk for the company and having a significant and  direct impact on commercial activities/ net income( these individuals should be moved to specialized technical)....and others who are performing a less strategic function( who should remain in the commercial support category). With that said, it is probably not necessary to undertake this effort for  mid-year PRC purposes since we are probably moving to a three peer stucture where that split could be achieved (for year-end purposes where the compensation impact would be felt). If we stay with the four group stucture, I intend to push hard for the remapping of Gov't Affairs by year-end.     On a completely seperate issue, I continue to be  very concerned about the impact of the ""preferred"" distribution  relative to the bottom category for "" commercial support"" groups(I'm not implying this is'nt an issue for commercial groups- I just don't have the same ability to assess the impact there)....the concern, simply stated,  is that  it may be entirely  counterproductive to force individuals who are not performance problems  into a category that has significant implications for their careers here at Enron, particularly after going thru the past year where many of the non-performers in my group and others  were moved out of the company- the replacement costs for moving good performers out of the company for the sake of a ""preferred"" distribution are quite high...and that is even before you begin  to assess the incalcuable damage to morale that will invariably occour.

This mapping is intended to illustrate from a functional view point where each activity was placed at Year End 2000 VP PRC.  We were considering moving to a 3 Peer Group Structure however it as agreed at the last PRC Committee Meeting  to stay with the current structure since the data had been cleaned and everyone felt generally comfortable where most activities had been placed with the exception of just  2 or 3. It was agreed that we should concentrate on resolving these rather than undertaking an organization wide remapping excercise to consolidate to 3 Peer Groups. All functions/activities within the business units should now be reflected on the acttached.   The actions points from this excercise are:  1 to review and agree the attached mapping   2    consider and comment on highlighted groups that we have discussed in previous PRC meetings and ask for your comments or objections to moving them  as indicated on the attachment.  3 invite your comments or questions on any other function that you consider questionable or requiring further explanation.        Please return your comments to David Oxley by Friday May 25.        To have this discussion now will save lengthy discussions in the final VP/MD PRC Meetings.

"Here's my list:  UK Power.  Address flaws in NETA through inter alia modifications to the  Balancing and Settlement Code.

Stella Chan and Pat Keene are currently streamlining the process of providing  Government and Regulatory support to URM (Utility Risk Management) to include: Curve validation Process,  Quantifying of Regulatory Risks/Change,  Coordination of Strategy Development, and  Coordination of Strategy Implementation.   A description of these functions are as follows: Curve Validation Process:  This process aims at reviewing, and validating,  every 90 days, the regulatory inputs of: a) the largest 60 curves in Enron's  books, and b) the new deals that are under approval during the review  period.  The curve validation process is currently in progress and  GA  personnel in Houston and the regions are already  involved.   Quantification of Regulatory Risks/Change:  This process aims at quantifying  dollars terms--the impact of the change in the regulatory inputs on a  specific position.  The model is now in place, and test is in progress.  This  process will involve initiation by GA regional personnel (also possibly by  URM) with potential regulatory changes that may impact EES positions.  The  quantification exercise will be done jointly by URM and GA.    Coordination of Strategy Development:  The outcome of curve validation and  quantification of regulatory risks--functions 1, and 2 above--will likely  call for a group of regulatory measures and action items. The function of  Stella and Pat is to coordinate and facilitate strategy sessions in  association with the owner of the curve in URM, and her/his counterparts in  Midwest/Midsouth, Atlantic Seaboard, the Western Region, and Texas & Oklahoma  Ercot, and SPP.   The strategy sessions shall come up with suggested action  items, probability of success, and likely associate costs for  implementation.  Stella and Pat shall be responsible for seeking the buy-off,  and approval, of  the strategy from URM and securing the needed budget, if  necessary. Coordination of Strategy Implementation:  Once the strategy is approved, it  shall enter the implementation stage.  The role of Stella and Pat is to  coordinate between URM requests/positions and their counterparts in the  regions.  As the case now, they shall continue supporting the regions in the  implementation as needed.     To facilitate these functions Stella and Pat shall emulate the coverage lines  of the URM.  Stella shall coordinate the Eastern Region, while Pat shall  coordinate the Western Region.  These regions do not follow the conventional  wisdom, and need to be specifically defined.  They are:  Eastern Region:  ME, NH, VT, NY, MA, RI, CT, NJ, PA, MD,  DE, VA, WV, NC,  SC, GA, AL, TE, KY, and FL.   Western Region:  The remaining states (including OH in the east).   From the Regional perspective, the process will naturally be overseen by the  Regional Managers (i.e., Steve, Janine, Jean, and Paul), meanwhile, Harry  shall oversee it from Houston side.  The process, however, is designed to be  as autonomous as possible and shall make the least possible demand on the  time and work load of the regional managers (usually in the final sprint for  approvals).

"Rick  As you know, the energy sector is facing several challenges: MAE  intervention, rationing, drafting a new market agreement and the like. It is  all happening as we speak.  In my capacity of President of the Brazilian Association of Energy Traders, I  have defended correct economic  signals, have a functioning MAE, keeping  market rules stable, creating wholesale and retail competition, honoring  contract sanctity, and the like. More importantly, that rationing should not  be an excuse for ""revoking"" supply and demand  Those are not ideologic positions only. They represent, in my view, the best  interest for Enron in the short, medium and long terms.  We have already  agreed on that in a recent Enron executive commitee. That means, I am in fact  wearing Abraceel hat to defend Enron's best interests.  Just two examples on how those principles are linked to our interest (among  many others)  a) By defending contract sanctity, we defended Elektro's contractual position  on Annex V, which sets a formula on how financial contracts  decline during  rationing. Simulations have indicated that our long position, even during the  deepest rationing will offset loss of revenues. On the contraty, w/o Annex V  loss of EBITDA may be US$ 60 million in 2001  b) By defending the integrity of MAE, spot prices and the like, we are paving  the road for Eletrobolt's success.  Needless to say, Abraceel message has been  consistent ""across the board"".  For example, if one believes on markets, we have to defend the use of market  signals (economic incentives/penalties) during rationing. And prices to  allocate a scarce resource. Also, as a corollary, no intervention in spot  prices, which will, in turn, make our Eletrobolt merchant plant feasible.  I feel very comfortable in defending Enron's interests and wearing my  Abraceel hat. There is a positive synergy.  However, Orlando is the President of ABRADEE, the Brazilian Association of  Distributors. The interests of ABRADEE are not always the interests of free  market (seldom are); nor they are the interests of Enron. For example,  ABRADEE as a group, criticizes the government for changing MAE governance;  they wanted rolling black-outs instead of economic signals; they advocate  caps on spot and the like.   Needless to say, there is a [potential] crash here, with some internal  reverberations.  Today,  the government announced the  rationing plan. It is based on quotas  with an overlay of economic signals (tied to wholesale prices). This is  consistent with markets and what ABRACEEL has been saying on and on. However,  ABRADEE wanted rolling black-outs.  (paving the road for eliminating MAE  rules and setting caps on spot to avoid exposures)  Guess what happened? Orlando is being pressured by his peers to criticize the  plan and kill it. I am convinced that the government made the right decision  (and we helped influence it)  The subject has received a lot of press coverage on TV, radio and other  media. Abraceel has been viewed as one of the champions of market forces.  Last Tuesday, I was invited to express our views to the ""Minister of the  Rationing"" and I think I was quite persuasive in showing that there is  elasticity in demand, MAE should work asap, intervention was necessary,  government should refrain from the temptation to set caps on spot, etc. Most  of those statements where contrary to what Abradee had stated in the very  same meeting. The plan the Government announced today embeds several elements  of market forces. It was a sudden shift from the plan announced a few days  ago, where market signals were completely neglected. (CERA has recently  referred to it as a ""step away from market forces""). And it was indeed.  Internally, we have been managing this tension in a productive way for Enron.  However, the situation is getting more complicated, as tension increases.  Orlando is getting a little uncomfortable because his peers perceive Luiz  Maurer as someone against the interest of the distribution business.  In sum, there is an internal issue going on. I do not want to be a trouble  maker. However, I feel that we have now a window of opportunities to make  things work. (or at least to try to) Our relationship with ANEEL and with the  powerful Ministry of Rationing has been excellent. I feel we should take  advantage of it and put a stick on the ground. That is our culture.    I think that spending too much time and energy in building consensus among  different stakeholders is not going to lead us anywhere (beside, we know that  we do not want markets). That is what we have been doing at COEX in the last  two years, with no material results. We have remained silent in key issues  waiting for this consensus to happen. This has been the case for the market  intervention. The market is misinterpreting our views. For example, there was  a  press article today, stating that Enron, together with AES, were  dominating COEX and are trying to revert the situation back to the old regime  (stakeholder board). What a gross misinterpretation of our views !!  Informativo Regulatorio #  3 has conveyed  the opposite message and it has  inspired ANEEL to start fixing the mess !! They gave us the credit. We are  still silent on our view, waiting for  consensus to happen.   May be I am in too much of a hurry, because I am leaving soon. But I feel  that we have a window of opportunity to make things happen (or at least  knowing that they are not going to happen any time soon). And we are not  taking advantage of it.  I am not expecting any immediate action from you. Just for you to be aware on  what is going on and  share some concerns.  If you have any comments or any   advise, please let me know.  I have even considered to resign Abraceel  leadership to avoid future internal conflicts.

"Rick  I was in Zurich on Friday and had an interesting discussion with Mauro  Renggli - head of our office there. The discussion and suggestions (below) were wholly at Mauro's instigation.  Over the past several months, Viviana has been tracking development in the  Swiss market and providing updates etc. to Mauro and his  team. He seems quite pleased with the work she is performing for him and has  asked if I would be supportive of Viviana transferring to  the Zurich office for 3+ months to work with his team. I told him I would  think about it. From my perspective, this may be a very useful step: 1) It allows her to get closer to a market she is already tracking for  reg. affairs and which is headed for some important developments ove the coming 6 months, 2) she is already a known and appreciated quantity  there, and 3) most importantly, she would be able to  work more closely with the small team there and perhaps get some of the  additional support and guidance that I have not been able to  provide.

FERC   I think that you should intervene and possibly take an active role for a  number of reasons.  Only if Enron were to win outright in the S.Ct. would  petitioners' challenge in Arizona become moot.  But as we have always  cautioned, the likelihood of overturning FERC and getting an S. Ct. decision  putting all transmission on the OATT remains a long shot.  It is more likely  that FERC will be affirmed and the DC Circuit's deference to FERC will remain  as to what it must be unbundled.  In that scenario, it will be important to  Enron that the Arizona precedent be upheld against challenge.  Specifically,  that precedent is that once retail choice is implemented, all transmission  becomes unbundled and subject to the OATT, even if later bundled in a default  standard offer.   Absent legislation, this precedent and the lackadaisical   RTOs are the only apparent vehicles for expanding open-access in the near  term.  For these reasons, Enron should intervene at minimal cost and monitor how  well FERC defends itself.  If FERC does a good job, that will be the end of  its.  However, if FERC does a poor job, Enron should then consider filing a  supporting brief.  ",richard.shapiro@enron.com,christi.nicolay@enron.com,Arizona Public Service v.

In general my assumptions and thoughts are as follows....  a) Medium term, we need to move in the direction of having local nationals -  instead of AngloSaxons - as our  lead face deep in the Germanic regulatory arena.  Styles & Hennemeyer will,  no doubt, continue to have  significant leadership roles; but, there is no substitute for locals. b) As the markets get more liquid, especially as clearer national and  regulatory bodies become established, the  opportunity for RegAffairs value add increases - not decreases.  Greater  liquidity and transparency will   increase the relative importance of transmission conditions. c) Market concentration is a big problem and will get much bigger.  This will  occupy a lot of time over the next few  years. d) Inevitably, some of the people we hire will go commercial, others will not  work-out and others will leave Enron.  If we try for 6 to 8, we will be lucky to get 3 or 4 by year end.  Of that,  we will be lucky if 2 or 3 are successful  RegAffairs people 2 years later.  It takes 2 years to grow our own top  quality professional.  We are behind. e) The gas market has only begun to move.  After a two year fight in that  market we will then have to content with  gas/power convergence which will introduce yet a new set of concentration  and transmission and plant siting  issues. f) Historically, our RegAffairs people have been our most effective  communicators in the public arena including  the media.  As liquidity increases, the pressure to do deals will grow  exponentially on commercial leads with  the result that they will step further and further away from the public  communicatioins arena.  But, particularly  in Europe, we will continue for a long time to need to maintain a certain  level of public profile.  Best done by  a RegAffairs person rather than someone who should be out doing a deal.  I will call later this morning.  Thanks.

In November 1998 the PSC concluded BellSouth had met the local  exchange market-opening mandates in section 271 of the federal  Telecommunications Act of 1996.  BellSouth yesterday submitted  third-party test results of its Georgia operation support system  and proposed performance-measurement and penalty plans.   BellSouth asked the PSC to reaffirm that it has met the Act's  market-opening requirements.  Compliance with section 271's 14-point ""competitive checklist"" is  a prerequisite for FCC authorization to provide in-region  interLATA service.  The FCC must consult with the U.S. Department  of Justice and relevant state regulators before ruling on the  applications.  (Docket no. 97-AD-321)  ______________________________________________________  FLORIDA -- Broward County repeals 'open-access' requirement  Broward County, Fla.'s County Commission yesterday voted to  repeal an ordinance that had required cable TV franchisees to  offer unaffiliated Internet service providers ""open access"" to  their cable modem platforms.  The vote puts the final nail in the  coffin for one of the earliest open-access initiatives.  In 1999, Broward became the second county in the U.S. to adopt an  open-access requirement following the lead of authorities in the  Portland, Ore., area.  (7/14/99)  A federal district judge in  Miami, however, ruled last year that Broward's ordinance violated  cable TV companies' rights to free speech and expression.  In  ""Comcast Cablevision of Broward County et al. v. Broward County""  (case no. 99-6934-Civ), Judge Donald M. Middlebrooks was the  first to rely on the First Amendment in nixing a locality's open- access ordinance.  While the county's appeal of that ruling was pending before the  U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit (Atlanta), the cable  TV companies filed a claim seeking attorneys' fees from the  county, said Terry Bienstock, a Miami attorney with The Bienstock  Law Firm, P.A., who represented the cable TV companies.  Both sides agreed to a settlement under which the parties would  drop their legal claims if the board voted to repeal the  ordinance, Anitra Lanczi, Broward's assistant county attorney,  told TR.  That agreement prompted yesterday's vote, she said.  ______________________________________________________  CALIFORNIA -- Pacific Bell to report on CLEC operational issues  Public Utilities Commissioner Geoffrey Brown has directed Pacific  Bell to file by May 29 an updated list of operational problems  recently raised by competitive local exchange carriers (CLECs).   On April 4-5 Mr. Brown convened a hearing to examine more than 50  systematic operational problems the CLECs had identified  concerning ordering, provisioning, post-provisioning, and  multifaceted issues.  During the hearings and the following six days, Pacific Bell and  the CLECs met to resolve as many issues as possible.  During an  April 12 hearing, Pacific Bell presented a status report, which  set task-completion dates for certain outstanding issues.    Mr. Brown said he wanted Pacific Bell to update the summary  regularly to allow the staff to monitor the progress.  The May 29  summary will identify which issues have been resolved and  highlight issues affecting more than one CLEC.  Comments on the  summary will be due June 11.  The staff will compile a final  summary of the issues by June 21.    After June 21, and until further notice, Pacific Bell must submit  a monthly updated issues/action log highlighting the issues that  were listed in the staff's June 21 final summary.    The order also directs the staff to inform Mr. Brown by Aug. 3 of  any progress made toward resolving problems regarding database  and documentation, installation trouble, and missed due dates.   The largest number of joint CLEC problems fell under those three  areas.  The staff also will advise Mr. Brown by Jan. 4, 2002, as  to what extent the other issues in the June 21 summary have been  resolved.  (Rulemaking nos. 93-04-003 and 95-04-043,  Investigation nos. 93-04-002 and 95-04-044)  ______________________________________________________  NEW MEXICO -- PRC to reconsider area code decision  The Public Regulation Commission has voted unanimously to  reconsider its decision ordering a ""split"" to relieve number  exhaustion in the ""505"" area code.  The commission is drafting an  order today that will include a schedule for hearings on the  matter, a PRC staff member told TR.  A group of businesses, citizens, and governmental entities  calling itself ""The '505' Coalition,"" asked the PRC to reconsider  the order.  (5/18/01)  The coalition is disappointed with the  PRC's decision to assign the new ""957"" area code to the most  populated areas of the state--Albuquerque, Santa Fe, and Los  Alamos.  The coalition said the PRC violated state law by allowing newly  sworn in Commissioner Rory McMinn, who hadn't participated in any  of the public hearings or meetings in the case to cast the  deciding vote in the matter.  According to the coalition, state  law (section 8-8-18 NMSA 1978) requires the recusal of a PRC  commissioner or hearing examiner in any case in which the  individual is unable to make a fair decision.  The coalition said  that, according to PRC records, Mr. McMinn or his staff never  reviewed the case's file.  ______________________________________________________  MASSACHUSETTS -- DTE to defer DSL cost issues  Two Department of Telecommunications and Energy hearing officers  have granted Verizon Massachusetts' request to defer  consideration of two digital subscriber line (DSL) cost issues.   Verizon asked the officers to delay establishing final rates for  conditioning of loops that meet Carrier Service Area standards  and final rates for line sharing collocation augment application  and engineering services.  Verizon said it would be more efficient to address the two issues  in the DTE's comprehensive TELRIC (total-element long-run  incremental cost) docket.  The items are the final issues  remaining in the DTE's 1998 advanced services rate investigation.  Covad Communications Co. opposed Verizon's request.  Covad said  removing the issues to the TELRIC docket would deprive the  parties of the extensive record on loop conditioning costs  developed in the advanced service docket.  Covad also said the  move would ""entail unnecessary time and expense.""  The DTE hearing officers said that the collocation and line  sharing costs are within the scope of the TELRIC docket and that  any matter contained in the advanced service docket would be  available to the parties in the TELRIC docket.  The officers also  noted that the rates proposed by Verizon in the TELRIC docket for  the two DSL items are lower than the interim rates set in the  advanced service docket.  Verizon will have to begin offering the lower proposed rates  immediately, subject to true-up when the TELRIC docket is  concluded.  (Docket no. D.T.E. 98-57, Phase III)  ______________________________________________________  ARIZONA -- ACC approves price hike  The Corporation Commission has adopted a settlement that  increases Southwestern Telephone Co.'s business and residential  rates, sets a 9% rate of return, and increases the company's  revenue by $20,000.  Southwestern, the commission staff, and the  Residential Utility Consumer Office (RUCO) were parties to the  settlement.  Southwestern originally asked for a 9.96% rate of return, based  on a $3.9 million fair-value rate base (FVRB).  The commission  staff and the RUCO proposed their own rates of return and FVRBs,  and the three parties worked together on a settlement.  The  agreement adopted the staff's proposed FVRB of $4.1 million.  The settlement will raise residential rates by 25 cents to $11.25  and will raise business rates by 90 cents to $24.90.   Southwestern serves about 4,600 access lines in the Quartzsite  and Salome exchanges.  (Docket no. T-01072B-00-0379)  ______________________________________________________  FLORIDA -- NeuStar to release 'growth code' to BellSouth  The Public Service Commission has ordered North American  Numbering Plan administrator NeuStar, Inc., to release a ""growth  code"" to BellSouth Telecommunications, Inc., for the Magnolio- ORLDFLMADS1 switch in the Orlando rate center.  BellSouth requested a growth code to meet a customer's request  for 2,500 consecutive DID (direct inward dial) numbers in an NXX  with a four as the last digit (NX4).  NeuStar denied BellSouth's  request because the company hadn't met the rate center months-to- exhaust (MTE) criteria required to obtain a growth code.  To  qualify for a growth code, carriers must have no more than a six- month inventory of telephone numbers in the rate center.   BellSouth appealed NeuStar's decision to the PSC.  The commission said the MTE criteria create a disadvantage for  carriers with multiple-switch rate centers.  One switch in a such  a center may be near exhaust while the average MTE for the rate  center is above six months, the PSC said.  When NeuStar denied  BellSouth's code request, the MTE for the Magnolia-ORLDFLMADS1  switch was four months.  (Docket no. 010309-TL)  ______________________________________________________  NORTH CAROLINA -- Commission sets number-pooling schedule  The Utilities Commission has ordered Telcordia Technologies,  Inc., to implement 1,000-number block pooling in the ""919"" area  code by Oct. 26.  Number pooling will postpone ""for as long as  possible"" the activation of the ""984"" overlay for the ""919"" area  code and the introduction of mandatory 10-digit dialing, the  commission said.  (Docket no. P-100, Sub 137)  ______________________________________________________  CALIFORNIA -- PUC to mull advice letter procedures  A Public Utilities Commission administrative law judge has asked  interested parties to comment on whether a hearing should be held  to discuss various proposals to change the advice letter process.   Regulated companies usually file advice letters to make routine  tariff changes.  According to the ALJ, a consequence of the proliferation of the  telecom industry is that the PUC's ""procedures for different  types of telecommunications advice letters also have proliferated  rapidly, sometimes even on a utility-specific basis.""  He said  the goal of this proceeding was to unify and simplify existing  procedures, which are scattered over many decisions and  resolutions.  The ALJ said some parties have asked the commission to retain  certain advice letter procedures, but they disagreed about which  ones should be kept.  The ALJ has asked interested parties to  respond by June 14 to his questions about advice letter  procedures that are inconsistent with the commission's general or  telecom rules.  Commenting parties also must discuss whether and  why they think a hearing would be warranted.  (Rulemaking no. 98- 07-038, Rulemaking for purposes of revising General Order 96-A  regarding informal filings at the Commission)  ______________________________________________________  ALABAMA -- Rule would revise reporting requirements  The Public Service Commission has asked for comments by June 25  on a proposed rule that would require long distance carriers to  identify, for informational purposes, their interstate long  distance per-minute rates in their tariffs.  The proposed rule  also would require carriers to identify the product name, per- minute rates, minimum monthly charges, and billing increments  applicable to intrastate long distance calling plans ""within the  same section under which the service is described in the tariff.""  The new rule would help the PSC respond to customer complaints,  the PSC said.  ""Rates associated with the [intrastate long  distance] plan such as the minimum monthly charge, call duration,  billing increments, etc., may not be found in the same general  area of the tariff as the rate schedule,"" the PSC said.  (Docket  no. 15957)  ______________________________________________________  NEBRASKA -- Gov. Johanns mulls fiber-optics bill  The Legislature has passed and sent to Gov. Mike Johanns (R.)  legislation to prohibit governmental agencies or political  subdivisions from providing telecom service for a fee or from  becoming certified as contract or common telecom carriers.   (3/23/01)  The measure would allow governmental agencies or  political agencies to own, sell, and lease dark fiber.  The  Public Service Commission would have to approve the lease price  and profit distribution for governmental bodies leasing dark  fiber.  Sens. Curt Bromm (Ind., District 23) and Bob Wickersham (Ind.,  District 49) introduced LB 827. ______________________________________________________  WISCONSIN -- New coalition seeks reliable telecom service  A coalition of Ameritech-Wisconsin customers and competitors has  formed to ""fight for affordable and reliable telephone service.""   The Wisconsin CALLS coalition includes the American Association  of Retired Persons, the Citizens' Utility Board, the Wisconsin  Merchants Federation, the Wisconsin Realtors' Association, the  Wisconsin Apartment Association, and AT&T Corp. as members.  The coalition supports a legislative reform initiative to (1)  establish specific service standards and penalties for poor  service by Ameritech, (2) permit customers and competitors to sue  Ameritech directly when it violates the law, (3) prohibit  Ameritech from double charging customers and developers for  connecting new real estate developments to the network, (4)  impose measure to increase local competition, and (5) order  structural separation of Ameritech.  Doug Johnson, senior vice president and general counsel for the  Wisconsin Merchants Federation, said, ""Our members depend upon  the reliability and affordability of the local telecommunications  system.  In the past year they have suffered major economic  damage as a result of loss of service, slow response time, and  high prices for basic service.  And since there is little or no  local phone competition, our members have no alternatives.""  ______________________________________________________  ILLINOIS -- CUB urges commission to order Ameritech rate cut  The Citizens Utility Board yesterday renewed its call for the  Commerce Commission to reduce Ameritech-Illinois' rates by $957  million.  CUB was responding to a recommendation by two hearing  examiners against including any revenue reduction when renewing  the company's alternative regulation plan.  (5/22/01)  A review of Ameritech's finances conducted by CUB and other  consumer agencies found that the company ""has underreported its  revenues and overstated its expenses to mask its true earnings  and ward off any rate reduction.""  When the company's books are  adjusted for those discrepencies, CUB said, the study shows rates  should be reduced by $957 million, a decrease that would save the  typical customer $120 a year.  CUB Executive Director Martin Cohen said, ""The hearing examines  ignored all the evidence showing that Ameritech's rates are  excessive.  But we've seen the ICC overrule their hearing  examiners on many occasions.  We look forward to arguing our case  directly to the ICC in the coming weeks.""  The ICC is scheduled to rule on the hearing examiners' proposed  order in July, according to CUB.  ______________________________________________________  DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA -- PSC adopts service-termination rules  The Public Service Commission has adopted rules governing service  termination by competitive local exchange carriers.  The rules,  which were first adopted on an emergency basis in March, also  modify existing regulations on tariff reviews, certification, and  annual reviews.  (3/30/01)  The rules will take effect when they are posted in the D.C.  Register.  (Formal case no. 892, Approval of Competitive Local  Exchange Carriers to Provide Telecommunications Services in the  District Order no. 12000)  ______________________________________________________  DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA -- PSC wants comment on subloop UNEs  The Public Service Commission has asked for comments by May 29  identifying subloop elements that Verizon Washington DC, Inc.,  must include in unbundled network element (UNE) cost studies due  July 16.  (5/2/01)   The PSC said Verizon and AT&T Corp. disagree as to whether a loop  concentrator is a subloop element, which must be unbundled.   Verizon argued that it isn't and that the FCC requires it to  unbundle only two subloop elements--the loop distribution and the  loop feeder.  The PSC said, ""Verizon is incorrect in asserting that the FCC  only included two subloop elements as UNEs; in fact the FCC  requires all subloop elements to be unbundled.""  The problem, the  PSC said, is that there isn't a list of subloop elements.   Although AT&T argued that the loop concentrator qualifies, ""AT&T  didn't define the term or explain its function,"" the PSC said.  Once parties provide a list defining each subloop element and  explaining their functions, the PSC will set a final list of  elements.  Verizon will have to provide costs for those elements  in its UNE cost studies.  (Order no. 12004, Formal case no. 962,  In the Matter of the Implementation of the District of Columbia  Telecommunications Competition Act of 1996 and Implementation of  the Telecommunications Act of 1996)  ______________________________________________________  VERMONT -- PSB orders number pooling  The Public Service Board has ordered telecom carriers to begin  1,000-number block pooling by May 1, 2002.  The PSB said although  its single area code, ""802,"" isn't in immediate danger, it still  may be susceptible to premature number exhaust.    The board noted a recent request for 98 central office codes  advanced 802's projected exhaust date from 2011 to 2007.  The PSB  said two more similar requests would exhaust the available number  supply completely.  The board plans to select an interim number-pooling administrator  within two months.  The PSB said it would establish a cost- recovery mechanism before pooling begins and appointed a hearing  officer to oversee the docket.  (Docket no. 6505, Investigation  into Area Code Relief for the State of Vermont)  ______________________________________________________  TEXAS -- WorldCom objects to SW Bell listing increase  WorldCom, Inc., has asked the Public Utility Commission to reject  Southwestern Bell Telephone Co.'s tariff increasing its directory  assistance (DA) listing rates.  In an informational tariff  filing, SW Bell increased its wholesale DA listing rates from  0.11 cents to 4 cents per initial listing.  Informational tariffs  take effect soon after filing, unless a party objects to it.  The PUC set cost-based rates for SW Bell's wholesale DA listings  in separate dockets.  SW Bell said its DA listings should be made  available at ""market-based"" rates consistent with the FCC's Feb.  17, 2000, unbundled network elements (UNEs) order.    WorldCom said the PUC's cost-based rates are permitted by the  FCC's directory listings and UNEs orders.  (Docket no. 24142)  ______________________________________________________  KANSAS -- SW Bell to reprint directory  Because of a publishing error, Southwestern Bell Telephone Co.  omitted about 20,000 residential and business listings from its  Shawnee Mission directory, which includes listings for Overland  Park.  SW Bell has distributed more than 200,000 copies of the  directory to customers in eastern Johnson County.  It plans to  redistribute corrected directories ""as soon as possible,"" a SW  Bell spokesperson told TR.  ______________________________________________________  VIRGINIA -- New '434' area code debuts June 1  North American Numbering Plan administrator, NeuStar, Inc., has  assigned ""434"" to the area carved from the ""804"" area code last  year.  The State Corporation Commission ordered the change in  December 2000 when it opted for a ""split""/""overlay"" combination  plan to relieve the impending number shortage in the 804 area.   (12/4/01)  The 434 code will be launched June 1, marking the beginning of a  seven-and-a-half month permissive-dialing period.  Mandatory use  of the new code will begin Jan. 15, 2002.  The 434 code will  serve areas to the south and west of the Greater Richmond area,  including the cities of Charlottesville, Danville, and Lynchburg.  The 804 area code will continue to serve the Greater Richmond  area, as well as the town of West Point and communities on the  upper and middle peninsulas.  Verizon Virginia, Inc., said the  change will have no effect on rates or local calling areas.  ______________________________________________________  OREGON -- PUC opens certificate-transfer rulemaking  The Public Utility Commission yesterday opened a rulemaking on  transferring to other carriers certificates of authority to  provide telecom service, a PUC staff member told TR.  The  commission doesn't have any rules on this issue.  (5/21/01)  The staff already has drafted a proposal based on the existing  requirements for obtaining a certificate.  The proposal would  require both parties to a transaction to file a joint  application.  According to the staff, this would ensure that both  parties concur with the specifics of the transfer.  The transfer applications also would be considered on an  expedited basis.  The draft rules would abolish the proposed  order and exceptions process in these cases, eliminating 36 days  from the proceeding.  The commission scheduled a July 23 workshop and a Sept. 24  hearing to receive input on the proposed rule.  (Docket no.

Mary Panzer (R., West  Bend) yesterday announced that they are introducing legislation  to protect consumers from unsolicited e-mail advertising, known  as ""spam.""  Under AB 416, a person would have to include the  letters ""ADV"" at the beginning of the message to indicate to the  receiver that the e-mail is an advertisement.  E-mail advertisements also would have to include a toll-free  number or return e-mail address so the recipients could respond  and ask to have their e-mail addresses removed from the  distribution list.  ______________________________________________________  GEORGIA -- Teleport offers credits for term commitments  Teleport Communications Atlanta, Inc., is offering a $2,500  equipment credit to business customers who order a new T-1 and  sign a three-year agreement.  Teleport also is offering a one- month credit of monthly recurring charges to T-1 customers who  commit to bill at least $500 in combined local and intraLATA  (local access and transport area) service per month and sign a  one-year term agreement.  The promotions apply to customers who order service between June  1 and Dec. 31.  ______________________________________________________  MICHIGAN -- Companies launch Internet services in Detroit  Qwest Communications International, Inc., today announced that  it's offering digital subscriber line Internet connections to  Detroit area businesses.  The service reaches almost 60% of the  area's small business market.  In the second quarter, the company  plans to initiate service via a local fiber network in Detroit to  provide customers with direct access to its high-speed global  broadband Internet network at speeds up to 10 gigabits per  second.  Also today, Focal Communications Corp. announced that it recently  launched its Internet eXchange service in Detroit.  The service  allows customers to bypass Internet bottlenecks by offering  direct access to multiple global backbone providers, Focal said.  ______________________________________________________  DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA -- PSC cancels service-quality meeting  The Public Service Commission has cancelled the June 5 meeting of  its Local Exchange Carrier Quality-of-Service Working Group.   Group member Verizon District of Columbia, Inc., earlier this  month said the working group wouldn't be able to make May  deadlines for submitting a draft performance-assurance plan and a  report summarizing lost-order trouble tickets.  The PSC established new due dates for the group's reports.  The  draft performance assurance plan is due June 8, the lost-order  trouble ticket report is due June 22, and a draft performance  metric change management plan is due July 6.  The PSC said its  staff would reschedule the June 5 meeting ""at a time that is  convenient to the working group members.""

I know Peter supposedly has this marked in  his diary for cancellation on the day it comes due, and you may well decide  that that is the appropriate course of action, but at least wanted to pass  this along, because I think any decision to cancel needs your objective  evaluation, something I think is lacking in Peter's judgment (how you can  decide to cancel without having seen the man's work, plus I do not think  Peter appreciates/understands the value, nor the nuances, of the argument  that you need a contracts market and retail competition, otherwise he would  support this work, since it bears directly on the Acceleration Directives  that he is supposed to be pushing in Brussels!).

"Rick,  Some comments from Nick are attached below.  Nick's first comment reflects a general concern I had about the paper which  was it's treatment of imbalance settlement.  I would see this as one of the  essential elements of market design.  I've always felt that the  physical/financial distinction was slightly artificial because even with  ""physical"" contracts, power systems must have a means for cash settlement of  imbalances (in the absence of universal controls which limit actual takes to  contract volumes).  However, the paper does not really pick this up and in  section 3.1 implies that cash settlement might only be ""feasible"" in some  market structures.  I would have added imbalance settlement to section 2.1  which describes the fundamentals required for any market.  It would also help  to draw a brighter distinction between spot markets and imbalance settlement.  At the same time I would have dropped the mention of ""binding market rules""  from 2.1.  I'd see this as a subset of the need for an ISO to take over the  operation of the system in real time rather than as a separate fundamental  principle.  It's also not made clear in what sense these commitments are  binding.  Are they binding in a financial sense (in which case they are  covered by imbalance settlement) or somehow physically (either this is  unfeasible since units trip etc or it requires some form of balancing penalty  which is ruled out later in the paper).  I felt that the paper also compounded issues such as LMP's/transmission  rights with other non-locational elements of market design, this makes it  difficult to follow in places.  It would be clearer to have the locational  elements addressed separately as an adjunct to the basic principles.  Centralised unit commitment is put up as an element of the model proposed.   As Nick hints at below, we wouldn't see this as an essential element of  market design.  Under NETA, individual participants commit their own units  with the SO only taking over full control at 3.5 hours out.  Even with  centralised commitment, I'm not convinced that simple bidding would be  superior to multi-part bids.  Much here depends on timescales, eg, a  day-ahead market with simple bids is more exposed to allocative inefficienc  than a continuous hourly market with simple bids.  Simple bidding was often  proposed for the Pool, but I think a single daily big would have increased  prices if two-shifting generators had not been able to reflect their start-up  and no-load costs separately.  (These elements were also gamed, although this  game eroded as competition increased.)  Specific UK sensitivities which you may want to finesse in the paper:  ? we've consistently opposed locational pricing because of our Teesside  positions.  Publicly we've argued that the proposals do not provide good  economic signals over sufficiently long time-periods to enhance allocative  efficiency and that the transactions costs outweigh any possible efficiency  gains (constraints only cost about o20m pa here).  Despite arguing our  commercial position, I'm quite happy with this approach and am genuinely  sceptical about the benefits of locational pricing in the UK.  This position  would of course change in much larger, sparse and less-interconnected  networks such as exist in parts of the US. ? Our fall back position is that any locational pricing scheme in the UK must  preserve pre-existing implied rights for generators, ie, grandfathering.  I  recognise that this can be a barrier to competition in some networks with  imcumbent market power, but I don't think that this is as big an issue in the  UK (where competition already exists) as it is on the Contintent and in the  US.  Hope these help, let me know if you want to discuss further.  Paul   -----Original Message----- From:  Elms, Nick   Sent: 22 May 2001 14:29 To: Dawson, Paul Subject: Frontier Economics' Whitepaper  Paul,  Here's some comments on Frontier's whitepaper. Do you want to discuss them?   Section 3.1 The distinction between cash and physical settlement of forward contracts is  blurred. Under NETA contract settlement is achieved by contract notification  to Elexon. Even then a party doesn't need to deliver on the contract - it  could cash out at the imbalance price. However, in practice NETA is more  similar to physical settlement since imbalance price volatility means Parties  try to avoid imbalances.   Section 4.1.1 Decentralised commitment doesn't require parties to trade physical  transmission contracts.  LMPs would also allow decentralised commitment.  It  is difficult to imagine an efficient dispatch resulting from flowgate trading  unless there are few transmission constraints and hence few flowgates.   Simplified flowgates is the same as zonal LMPs.  Interim model (section 5) 1) It will be difficult to impose a single RTO design on the multitude of  jurisdictions in the US - because of the private stakes in the industry. 2) The proposed day-ahead market need not be run by the ISO.  It's not a unit  commitment since it may not result in a feasible unit commitment, and even if  it did Parties may deviate through imbalance trading.  Rather, day-ahead  trading could be left to the market to develop.  Generators would self commit  based on their own forecasts of spot prices for the following day and parties  could hedge their positions through day ahead contracts trading.  These  day-ahead energy contract markets would be based at hubs - leaving parties  with basis risk between the hub and their location.  Parties require some  means of heging the basis risk - financial transmission rights is a  possibility.  Competitive framework (section 6) 1) Demand side response reduces generators' market power.  Forward  contracting mitigates the effect of market power on both generators and  consumers, particularly the impact of short term market power. This may be an  argument for using HHIs to measure market power. 2) A move towards regulatory intervention every time the supply/demand  imbalance became tight would add to regulatory risk.  And it may deter new  entrants if such intervention prevents prices from rising. 3) With full retail competition there is no need to regulate suppliers'  forward contracting since suppliers can only pass on their competitive costs  to customers.  Non-eligible customers create a problem.  What price should  these customers pay?  It is difficult to regulate a supplier's contracts and  to somehow split its contract costs between eligible and non-eligible  customers.  This is why a spot price pass-through is suggested.  Financial  institutions would be free to provide hedging contracts to consumers. Those  institutions would in turn have financial contracts with generators.  An  alternative is incentive regulation of suppliers of non-eligible customers.   To avoid the california problem the regulator would need to limit the  supplier's downside and upside risk.

"Sue Nord, Sr. Director Government Affairs 713 345-4196  ----- Forwarded by Sue Nord/NA/Enron on 05/24/2001 04:53 PM -----   Scott Bolton@ENRON COMMUNICATIONS  05/23/2001 08:47 PM        To: Sue Nord/NA/Enron@Enron    cc: Stephen D Burns/Corp/Enron@Enron    Subject: Summary of Evil RBOC Campaign  Sue, per our discussion earlier, I wanted to outline the latest on  Tauzin/Dingell and the UNE proceeding at the FCC.  Over the past 2 days,  Steve and I met with the staff of Sen. Wyden, Sen. Cantwell, Rep. Largent,  Rep. Markey, and with Rep. Boucher.  Additionally, we attended an RGA forum  on ""broadband deployment"" presented by Verizon and ATT, and  met with reps  from Comptel.  We also spent some time (off the clock) with Aileen and  Johnathan Hintzman w/ KDW.  From all of these sources, we came up with the  following observations/takeaways:  The RBOCs have a very expensive, sophisticated campaign in place to reduce  access to their high-speed networks (it is now generally accepted that this  is the main thrust of their effort - not sec.271 relief for data), This campaign has several facets - the Tauzin/Dingell bill, UNE Petition at  the FCC, delay/refusal of UNE provisioning to CLECs.  The campaign's main  themes are that the '96 Act was only to open local networks for voice  competition, regulatory relief is needed for telcos to compete w/ cable  monopolies, CLEC business plans are unsound unless they are facilities-based,  and only use UNEs as a transitional method of entry, Both the UNE Petition and the T/D Bill would effectively prevent the  unbundling of ILEC network elements that are classified as ""High-speed"" or  ""broadband"" - meaning wholesale access to any UNE beyond narrowband voice  facilities would be denied. Tauzin/Dingell is now on referral to the House Judiciary Cmte.  Judiciary has  a relative short time to examine the bill (they were only referred the 271  provision, not the whole legislation) and will then report the bill out with  or without amendment, According to Rep. Boucher, the anti-trust language of the Cannon/Conyers  amendment (which would make unbundling/interconnection complaints against  ILECs an automatic anti-trust violation) will not likely survive a full cmte  vote and he believes the bill will go back to Commerce with little change, Rep. Largent's office told us that they have not developed a floor strategy  yet to attempt to defeat T/D when it gets to the full House, but they expect  the final vote to be bitter and very close (probably in favor). Our meetings with the Senate suggested that they are not likely to take up  T/D.  We believe that is still the case, especially in a Democrat-controlled  Senate (which should be determined very soon).  This would make Sen.  Hollings, an ATT ally, Commerce chairman, On the regulatory side, Comptel and KDW were both taking the UNE Petition  very seriously, Neither Steve nor I are confident that Comptel will carry a very effective  argument this time - they are pursuing economic and network data that, in the  end, will not make a convincing argument and will not have significant buy-in  from other Comptel members.  Their focus on backbone network maps, IRUs, and  deconstructing the USTA competition report is not constructive, KDW is leading a group of small CLECs and has invited our participation.  I  think that we should participate in the effort but hold off in determining  whether to file our comments with them or separately until we have a better  feel for the focus of their argument and if we can provide a unique  perspective,  Based on the above, Steve and I have developed this prognosis:  T/D will likely fail to move in the Senate, though the RBOCs may try some  different tactics than in the House. Failing a legislative remedy, the RBOCs full energies will then focus on the  FCC. It is very difficult to say how the new commission will rule on the various  regulatory proceedings there.  However, Congress can send strong cues to the  commission and opportunities to push back the RBOCs will be available,  especially if T/D fails in a big way. The threat that these attempts by the RBOCs pose to EBS is paramount.   Considering that the RBOCs will likely continue to gain 271 approvals in the  states, the ability to have below special-access pricing for local  connectivity will mean the success or failure of bandwidth trading, since  there would be no way to compete with the Bells on end-to-end bandwidth  services.  I hope this is helpful as you prepare your download to Ken/Kevin/Jim.  Please  let Steve or I know if you have any questions or would like additional follow  up on any of these points.

I had also talked to him a few weeks ago about the same.    In  addition, I've had several conversations with Joe Bill Watkins, an attorney  in Austin who is working with the Greater Houston Community to find an  ""independent thinker"" for this job.     I recommend that we support Oliver Pennington.   It's clear from our  conversations that he doesn't know much about the rail industry (he was  inquiring about the difference between the STB's and the FRA's role in  regulating the industry), but he appears to be -- and from all accounts,  would be-- a fair-minded regulator.   He said he wants to ""make a  difference"", and would not be afraid to shake things up to make that  happen.     As Chris suggests, we should not support the names being floated in the  industry.   Bratten is a railroad sympathizer in shippers' clothing.    While  Alice Turnquist is a good friend of Susan Lent (our lobbyist from Akin Gump),  she is very close to Union Pacific.   Of all the rails, UP is the most  resistant to change, and has a very well organized, very effective government  affairs team in Washington.     Besides Linda Morgan's spot, there is a second spot that will be open when  Clyburn departs (his term has already expired).  I would also recommend that  we interview Mark Palmer's friend (I cannot recall her  name) for this  position.   She has excellent transportation experience, lives in Washington,  and may be willing to step out to make much-needed changes to the  industry.    We tried to reach her last week, but she was out of town for the  holiday weekend.   I will follow up with Mark on this.

The three names most often  mentioned for the new Surface Transportation Board Chairman are Dwayne  Ackerly (trucking company executive from Nebraska), John Bratten (National  Grain and Feed Association Rail Committee Chair, also from Nebraska), and  Alice Turnquist (former House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee  Chair).  The railroads are not interested in the structural changes we would like to  implement in the market and they have had a difficult time understanding the  benefits of a secondary market in rail.  While the persons named above would  be better than the current Chair, we are reluctant to support their  nominations because of their close ties with the railroads (Union Pacific  especially).  We think the ideal candidate for the job would be a fresh  thinker that understands rail issues, but is not beholden to the railroads.  One name that has been mentioned is Texas attorney Oliver Pennington.  Lisa  and I spoke to Mr. Pennington about the job and he is more interested in an  SEC position, but is willing to examine the STB Chair.  We have confirmed  that Mr. Pennington would be open to our rail proposal and would manage the  STB as a consensus builder with all interested parties.  Mr. Pennington has  his resume and other supporting documentation at the White House for both the  SEC and STB positions.   Attached is Mr. Pennington's resume.

Luiz,  Generally an excellent job.    I would make a stronger point of the fact that many technical experts (us  included) believe that cost-of-defecit should be multi-tiered, and that even  the first tier should be higher.  I also wouldn't concede that changing the  cost of defecit is a change of the rules.  Nevertheless, leaving it where it  is probably the best compromise between true market incentives and political  pressures.  I would also strengthen the arguments supporting the MAE: e.g. there is no  substitute for an efficient central clearing mechanism with accurate price  signals, credit integrity, and timely cash settlement.  I WOULD NOT make the  resolution of Angra II a pre-condition for the continuing well-being of the  MAE.   Let's just get the market working now (e.g. governance,  penalties/guaranties, accounting) on an ongoing basis; I think that the issue  of Angra II can be treated separately.

Last Friday, Patricia Arce, (Mario Arce's daughter and a full time  ASMAE  employee) was expressing her [distorted] views  to the press on why  generating companies should not abide by Annex V. She was not speaking on  behalf of ASMAE: however, she was probably reflecting ASMAE view.   I did not mean to shoot the messenger, but I could not refrain myself from  expressing an opposite opinion.  There are two problems in Patricia's view:  1) She is not supposed to express any views on contracts. MAE should only  settle contracts, but never attempt to arbitrate or solve bilateral contract  disputes. The lack of clarity on this point is the sole responsible for MAE's  frustrated attempt to solve the Angra II - Furnas conflict in the last 6  months.  Informativo Regulat?rio # 4 explores the issue in more detail.  2) She was dead wrong. Quite na<ve arguments.     A few arguments why Gs should indeed abide by Annex V (we may use externally,  as you see fit)  1) Gs were forced to sign Initial Contracts.  * So what? It is a regulated contract by nature, as so many others, such as  CUST, CUSD, CCT, CCD. Does it mean that parties signing those other  agreements should not abide by their clauses?  2) Gs and Ds did not have chance to negotiate terms and conditions  * So what? I asked Patricia why should any agent sign the Market Agreement  without any chance to negotiate its terms (it is by definition an adhesion  contract). Does it mean that agents should not abide by the MAE Agreement  provisions? Guess what the answer was? None  3) Some Gs did not sign Annex V - e.g. Furnas, which [apparently] disobeyed  Annel's instructions (as per Law 9.648/98)  *  This is serious  *  That means that in addition to not be bound by Contract, those Gs do not  want to abide by Law? No response  4) Some companies do not have Annex V  * So what? Discussion is about Annex V  * Those companies should follow specific provisions on their supply contracts  6) Ttariff (energy price) was not subject to negotiation as part of the  Initial Contracts - therefore, they were not able to price the risk  represented by Annex V  *  So what?  *  Many contracts have regulated prices. All use of system contracts have  regulated prices.  *  Furthermore, the privatized generators had chance to price the Annex V  risk. Why giving them a windfall now? (Since it is a zero sum game, a  windfall for generators is tantamount to a loss to distributors)  7) Annex V was not designed to deal with rationing: it was designed to  mitigate hydrological risks due to central dispatch  * Wrong  *  ERM (Mecanismo de Realoca??o de Energia) was the mechanism put in place  to deal with risks deriving from a central dispatch in a hyper tight pool  operation  *  Annex V was indeed designed to deal with rationing. It is called ""dry  period relief"" clause. It was proposed by the generators and approved by  Annel. The spot price is a ""proxy"" for the depth of rationing. One should not  evoke rationing.   I think it is advisable to have a strong legal opinion on how Annex V is  ""bullet proof"". In the meantime, let me share my views:   * There is very limited room for negotiation whatsoever on Annex V and on  the [ridiculous] proposal made by generators that merchant plants should  collect part in cash and part of their sales in [junk] bonds. We should make  this clear at the outset.    *  We should make Minister Patente realize  that Mario Arce's proposal is  non-sense. Changing established contracts or setting caps on spot prices  is  a bad precedent. No bail out for the ones who did mitigate perfectly known  risks. A cap on spot is equivalent to what the Central Bank did for Makra and  Fonte-Cindam (and became a public scandal) .  If we do want to create a  market , we need to have responsible contracting. Irresponsible contracting  should not be forgiven. If we do it, we will create a bad precedent and a  poor environment for contracting. We have to show Minister Parente that  irresponsible contracting has to be penalized at market rates (no caps on  spot). Irreponsible contracting will not expand capacity. Breaching contracts  will create an uncertain environment for new PPAs. Crisis will get worse and  worse.   *  Generators should have the burden of proof.  In the meantime, Annex V is  effective and should be enforceable   * Regarding California case, as mentioned by Mario Arce: It is a totally  different situation. In California D/Cs were not allowed to contract. In  Brazil they were strongly encouraged. Generators who signed Annex V could  also have hedged their residual risks on Annex V.They did not. They acted  irresponsibly. They second-guessed regulations. They did not help in  expanding capacity. They knew goverment will bail them out and revoke Annex  V.    *  The argument ""no one should lose, no one should gain"" during rationing is  inconsistent with market signals. Some one has to lose, some one has to gain  by definition. And [hopefully] someone has to go bankrupt. This will be a  great lesson. People will start taking market signals more seriously.  Otherwise, there will never be expansion and there will never be a market.   *  We have to be as transparent as possible.  Finally, I suggest Enron to write a position paper on our own view on Annex V  and caps on spot and deliver it to Minister Parente early this week.   I volunteer to prepare a first draft, if you guys agree it is a good idea.

I hope you are enjoying the challenge of running Enron in the midst of all the excitement and change in the energy industry.  I want to bring to your attention an issue that affects me quite directly in my new role as CEO of TransElect, an independent electric transmission company.  I think it also affects Enron in a very significant way.  The National Grid has applied to the FERC for a declaratory order that would permit the Grid to operate the Alliance RTO (this is a Midwest RTO that includes AEP, Exelon, DTE, CMS, First Energy and Dominion).  I believe quite strongly that FERC should deny this petition because the Grid is a significant owner of both distribution and generation assets in the Northeast (New England Electric and Niagara Mohawk).  It is a very small step from this decision to one that would allow Southern to operate GridSouth, or one that would allow Entergy to operate the Florida RTO in exchange for FP&L operating the Entergy RTO.  As a matter of National policy, transmission operators should be independent of either the wholesale or retail electric markets.  As a business issue, many transmission owners are reluctant to divest of transmission because they retain hope that their transmission can be used to protect above market native generation.  How would you like to try shipping power into the Northeast with the Grid, a major retail supplier and a significant generator, controlling access to the market?  I think it is important that the FERC give the Grid a ""no"" on the request for permission.  It is even more important that the issue be decided by the ""new FERC"".  There is a disturbing indication that the outgoing chairman might okay this request on his way out the door.  I urge you to intervene as a way to both slow down the freight train and as a way to get the right answer out of FERC.  If you or your General Counsel would like more information, give me a call at 503 636-7134, or call my General Counsel, Al Statman, at 202 393-1200.  Thanks for considering the issue, and best wishes for continued success.

"Rick,  Jane Wilson leaving is a loss to us professionally as well as to me  personally. I will really miss Jane. I would like to speak with you about  regulatory coverage. One relatively quick thing I would like to have happen  is to get Amr Ibrahim out here for a few weeks. I'm thinking about perhaps  overlapping with Jane for one full week before she leaves (he would be here  on Monday, June 11) and have him remain for 2 full weeks after Jane is gone.   Primary purpose in having Amr here is to oversee transition from Jane to our  local team on the ground, who Jane has trained. Plus Amr can evaluate our  regulatory needs and ensure that we have the right quality and number of  people. Obviously, we are in a wind-down mode in India, but this will take  several months (perhaps up to a year), and there will be a number of  legal/regulatory matters to deal with. Finally, I would feel comfortable if  you had someone on ground here, such as Amr,  for a while serving as your  eyes and ears, so that you can be comfortable that regulatory affairs are  being handled properly.  I suggest Amr because he is well known out here, he has done a very good job  and is well respected. If you would prefer someone else come out in this  interim period, let's discuss that. I will admit that I do not have any idea  what Amr is working on right now so I don't know his time availability.  I recommend we speak on Thursday or Friday morning. I have phone calls on  Thursday from about 8:30am Houston time until 10:30 am Houston time. On  Friday, I have calls from 8:30 am to 9:30 am. If we could speak either before  this or after that, that would be fine.

After consideration of currents events we believe this in an opportune  moment for you to resign as President of Abraceel and turn over the reigns to  your successor.    Two reasons.  First,  the President's position in Abraceel is one that you  could not fill from Houston and given your imminent departure you need time  to advise your Board and plan for an orderly transition; secondly, as  President of Abraceel, you are called by the press to make public statements  to defend the position of power marketers in general. This is why we wanted  you in that role in the first place, but due to the current circumstances  that has become a temporary liability.  When you speak to the Press, you are mostly identified by the informed sector  leaders as Enron, no matter how thoroughly you try to clarify that  you are  speaking as President of Abraceel. In the meantime,  Orlando is in the middle  of intensive negotiations with the government members and some of your recent  comments have been untimely, in that it makes it appear, in public, that the  Crisis Management Group issue leader, in insensitive to the power marketers  (read Enron) position, thus undercutting his leverage. That also puts you in  an awkward position, because as President of the organization you are not  serving the membership by not engaging in the public debate.  But this does not mean that you are not still fully engaged in the battle!.  Your prediction that the ""policy makers"" are taking decisions that will hurt  the market may come true, and if so, we Enron, will come out fighting.    In the mean time,  we will be needing your background and knowledge to move  our viewpoints through the open doors that have been presented to us in the  negotiations.   Rick Shapiro has committed your assistance to the region as long as it is  needed. Joe and Orlando would have wished that the clock could be stopped and  you physical departure be postponed. But they are well aware that it is not  fair to you and your family to postpone the move. We will work something out  so that you can provide assistance from the USA.

With the ""DC office"" appearing only in supporting roles on reports like  these, Rick and Steve Kean are going to continue to have the impression that  we exist to schedule meetings and execute plans formulated by others.  You  know this is a sensitive point for me personally, but beyond that, it is  important to my career development that I be seen as taking more of a lead.   I suppose Allison would feel the same way once she becomes more comfortable  and familiar with the issues.  Therefore, two requests.    Would you consider listing Allison and me as individuals, not as ""DC Office""?  Also -- and here I may be pushing it --  as you and I have discussed a couple  of times, am I taking the lead in the cable issue?  What about the BLM  issue?  I always appear to Rick and Steve to be supporting Scott on these  initiatives.  In my own twisted mind, I think of myself as having more of a  leadership role.  Sorry to continue to be ultra sensitive about this.  But frankly (just  between the two of us, please) since we've just brought on 2 new Senior  Directors in the past month (knocking me a couple of rungs down the seniority  ladder in one fell swoop), I am trying to increase my visibility ... and  maybe claim a little more credit for issues that I have before.

"I've arranged 2 meeting in Paris on with EFET- France re gas issues. The  agenda will include our take on what is going on in the US and French Gas  issues. I have a feeling unfortunately that this meeting will not be well  attended as we set it up farley late. Caroline Lambinon from Dalkia (French  ESP with EDF, Vivendli ownership) is the only person that has responded.   The second meeting is with the French regulator. Again the opportunity to  meet with them is based on the Cal experience. Michel Massoni will be present  with others yet to be determined.   Massoni is the director for the  department in charge of  relations with Third Parties. I will forward you  more information on the French market.

Note  that these papers were produced in December of 2000 and mid-Feb 2001  respectively. Notable changes since then include.  A relatively competitively priced conversion service (H-Cal to L-Cal gas) at  TaiseniSres has been but in place  The balancing regime has been improved and penalties are now indexed to  Zeebrugge (x 1.5 or x -0.5) Access conditions to LNG have been published Flexibility services are offered by GdF- Supply. The terms and conditions up  to now had been onerous. Recent talks between Didier and a customer suggest  that they have been wildly improved but this still needs to analysed by us. Transit tariffs have been published but is also restricted to a  year-long.  The regulator is seriously considering changing the tariff structure from a  distance related structure to a entry/exit type structure. The first hearing on the law (directive transposition) at the parliament has  been delayed from spring 2001 to summer 2002. Regulated tariffs will not  likely be put in place until 2003.

"Background  The Continental European electricity market is developing from an integrate= d=20 monopoly business to a competitive market. A segment of electricity users n= ow=20 have the right to choose their supplier from a range of marketers. The=20 emergence of new marketers and generators has created the demand for price= =20 risk management solutions and has encouraged the development of a traded=20 wholesale market. Following the adoption of the EU Electricity Directive in= =20 December 1996, member states were obliged to transpose the directive into= =20 national legislation opening electricity markets to competition by February= =20 1999.  The directive sets out a three-tiered approach to the liberalisation of=20 electricity supply markets. Stage one entered into effect on 19 February=20 1997, and calls for the opening of 22% of national markets, based on the=20 average community share of electricity consumed by end customers using more= =20 than 40 GWh per year. The degree of opening will increase over six years by= =20 lowering the community consumption threshold to 20 GWh in 2000 (27% market= =20 opening) and to 9 GWh in 2003 (32-33% market opening). Distributor access i= s=20 a matter for each member state. The implementation of a new directive,=20 expected in 2002, will improve the conditions for a liberalized market.  At present, the level of compliance with the directive varies between membe= r=20 states. The EU countries farthest along the process of liberalisation are= =20 Germany, Austria, Spain and the Netherlands. Switzerland, although it is no= t=20 an EU member state, is integral to market developments. France, although=20 having chosen to comply with the minimum requirements of the directive, has= =20 proven to open up their market more than expected.   =20  Current Market  EDF is the dominant electricity producer in France, the largest power=20 producer in the world with 475TWh generated in 2000,  and the largest=20 exporter in Europe (net exports reached 71 TWh in 2000).  Power generation = in=20 France is mainly nuclear (70%), but also hydro (20%), while conventional=20 thermal generation represents 10%. EDF is a vertically integrated company= =20 with services and products in generation (92%), supply (?%), transmission a= nd=20 distribution (95%). Finally, this historical supplier is a State Entity; th= e=20 French State owns EDF=01,s capital.  A few Independent Power Producers (IPP= ) are=20 also active in the market, such as Snet (6.4TWh, coal-fired), and CNR (16TW= h,=20 hydro). Other smaller IPPs are commercially active but most must sell their= =20 production to EDF under a regulated tariff.=20  More than 100 distribution companies are active through a concession regime= =20 in their local distribution area. Few, however, are of a significant size= =20 (less than a dozen have sales of over 400 GWhs), or have eligible customers= =20 in their concession areas.  The French System Operator (RTE) was created on 1 July 2000 and is a=20 sub-division of EDF, although it is unbundled in terms of management and=20 accounting. A postage stamp tariff has been implemented under the=20 transitional regime, which varies according to the voltage used and is base= d=20 on a matrix (Summer/Winter, Peak/Off-Peak).

The establishment of= =20 balancing responsibility contracts has created the basic conditions for an= =20 effective power trading market in France, and this through the exchange of= =20 blocks from one perimeter to another.

Several application decrees still have to be passed, including=20 transportation tariffs on the electric grid to eligible customers. The=20 current threshold for eligibility is 16GWh (net of auto-consumption) per ye= ar=20 and per site, and represents about 600 eligible clients and 1,200 sites.=20 Eligibility for distribution companies is currently limited to the eligible= =20 consumption of customers located in their concession areas. The French powe= r=20 market is effectively open to some competition, and about 60 eligible=20 industrials have so far switched totally or partly from the historical=20 supplier. The eligibility threshold will be reduced to 9GWh per site by=20 direct application of the EU Directive by Feb. 2003, as the French governme= nt=20 declined a quicker opening of the power market.  The two main authorities, which oversee the industry, are the CRE (Commissi= on=20 de Regulation de l'Electricit,) is the official regulatory body and the=20 ministry of industry. The CRE is responsible to insure that RTE provides fo= r=20 non-discriminatory access on to the grid and will be issuing transportation= =20 tariffs.

On the remaining borders, capacity is currently=20 allocated on a first-come-first served basis rule, and congestion fees are= =20 levied at the margin, which favours long-term contracts and historical=20 players. In addition, there is currently some lack of transparency with=20 regards to RTE real-time data on the capacity available/used for exports an= d=20 imports. However an intra-day market is now effective for transits, imports= =20 and exports.  The first come first serve allocation rule on border capacity= =20 is likely to be changed by end 2001.

Your comments are appreciated.  Thanks  Pierre   Updated May 2001.  1)Background  France is the second largest country in Europe with 58 million inhabitants.= =20 EdF, who was the monopolistic producer, is the largest power producer in th= e=20 world with 475TWh generated in 2000, thanks to nuclear production. The=20 historical supplier, who is at the same time the largest exporter of power = in=20 Europe (net exports reached 71TWh in 2000), is a direct emanation from the= =20 French State, who owns EdF capital. Power generation in France is mainly=20 nuclear (70%), but also hydro (20%), while conventional thermal generation= =20 represents 10%. EdF owns 92% of power generation, and 95% of distribution.= =20  A few Independent Power Producers (IPP) are also active in the market, such= =20 as Snet (6.4TWh, coal-fired), and CNR (16TWh, hydro). Other small IPPs sell= =20 their production to EdF under a regulated tariff. There has been significan= t=20 development of cogeneration projects since 1997. There is now 3,500MW of=20 installed capacity, thanks to the legal obligation for EdF to purchase powe= r=20 generated from cogeneration units at a preferable (is ""preferable"" the=20 correct word??)   tariff. In the view of the transposition of  the EU=20 Electricity Directive into French law, this purchase obligation ceased to= =20 apply for new large projects (over 12MW) from 1st Jan. 1999. More than 100 distribution companies are active through a concession regime= =20 in their local distribution area. Few, however, are of a significant size= =20 (less than a dozen have sales of over 400 GWhs), or have eligible customers= =20 in their concession area.  2) Regulatory Environment  The French Electricity law was passed on 10 February 2000, implementing=20 regulated third party access (TPA) in France under a transitional regime. T= he=20 law was approved one year late, failing to meet the required EU deadline.= =20 Dozens  [""Dozens""  - I would replace this with ""Several"")  of application= =20 decrees still have to be passed, including tariffs to eligible industrials.= =20 The French power market is open to competition, however. About 60 eligible= =20 industrials have so far switched totally or partly from the historical=20 supplier. Current threshold for eligibility is 16GWh (net of=20 auto-consumption) per year and per site, representing about 600 eligible=20 clients and 1,200 sites. The eligibility threshold will be reduced to 9GWh= =20 per site by direct application of the EU Directive in Feb. 2003, as the=20 French government declined a quicker opening of the power market.  Eligibility of distribution companies is limited to the eligible consumptio= n=20 of customers located in their concession area. =20 A three-year framework contract ( e.g., by way of a Master Agreement with a= =20 minimum term of three years) is required for eligible customers, but=20 eligibles are free to deal for shorter maturity transactions within such a= =20 three year contractual framework. =20  New IPPs have to be authorised through auctions or through direct decision= =20 from the Ministry of Industry, which is the main route for authorisation.= =20 Authorised IPPs in France are limited by Decree to trading buy for resale t= o=20 eligible customers a volume equivalent to 20% of the installed capacity,=20 including long term contracts. Trading is currently defined as the conditio= ns=20 of power purchase for resale to eligible customers. These Trading=20 restrictions, however, do not apply to ECTRL, as we are not registered in= =20 France. IPPs are free to sell and export power.  The French System Operator (RTE) was created on 1 July 2000 and is a=20 sub-division of EdF, although it is unbundled in terms of management and=20 accounting. A postage stamp tariff was implemented under the transitional= =20 regime, which varies according to the voltage used,and which is based on a= =20 matrix (Summer/Winter, Peak/OffPeak). Users have to contract transmission u= p=20 to the maximum capacity that they will use. RTE purchases excess capacity= =20 available through transmission contracts at fixed prices, which represents= =20 about half of the market price. Imbalances are settled under a published=20 tariff, which introduces high charges for imbalances beyond a 10% tolerance= =20 level and 5MW. Although the criteria for eligibility is per site, and=20 eligible customers have to contract transmission for each site, RTE has=20 created programme responsible contracts (contrats de Responsable=20 d'Equilibre), which allow the aggregation of imbalance charges for differen= t=20 eligible sites within an equilibrium perimeter defined with RTE.  Eligible customers, who are physically connected to the Grid, have to=20 contract for transmission vis-.-vis RTE (Contrat Made). Traders, such as=20 ECTRL, are not required to have such a transmission contract, as they do no= t=20 consume the power they purchase. Only a programme responsible contract=20 coupled with grid access contracts (import, export, and/or transit) are=20 required by RTE. =20  A new Decree is expected to be passed by Summer 2001, setting up new=20 conditions for transmission, transits and exports under a permanent regime.= =20 It is likely that this new tariff will implement a 1/3 injection-2/3 delive= ry=20 calculation factor. Imports, which are allocated on a pro-rata basis, are= =20 free of transmission charges. =20  Programme responsible contracts have established the basis of trading in=20 France through the exchange of blocs from one perimeter to another.  Enron= =20 Capital & Trade Resources Limited (""ECTRL"")  is programme responsible in=20 France. Cross border capacity is currently allocated on a first-come-first= =20 served basis rule by RTE, and congestion fees are levied at the margin, whi= ch=20 favours long term contracts and does not give equal treatment to all player= s.=20 In addition, there is currently some lack of transparency with regards to R= TE=20 real-time data on the capacity available/used for exports and imports.

In addition, the CRE is=20 likely to request RTE to release additional data in the months to come.  = =20  The CRE (Commission de Regulation de l'Electricite) is the offical regulato= ry=20 body, which mainly covers TPA and tariff issues, while IPP licenses and=20 eligibility issues are covered by the Ministry of Industry.      =20       =20 3) Business Opportunity  Although we are currently under a transitional regime in France, the abilit= y=20 to trade power already exists. Optimisation can be found through real-time= =20 arbitrage between the flexibility of the industrial process, market prices= =20 and optional structures. The establishment of programme responsible contrac= ts=20 has created the basic conditions for an effective power trading market in= =20 France.

Register for the auction and receipt of the IM asap.  Bruno could you  please discuss with Mark and put together our registration document.  I  assume that ECTRL meets the criteria of a trader ""registered"" in an EU member  state?  Does not appear to be any need to deal with credit support or other  regulatory ""qualifiers"" such as balancing agreements as yet.  Mark - agree?   Bruno - could you please take care of sending this registration letter (agree  with Pierre who should act as principal contact). ? Establish once and for all the role of Trustee and CRE in the process of  approving capacity release phasing, auction process for each phase and  product specifications AND understand how the ""consultation"" process will  work once we have the IM.  Hence need to discuss with MTF, then Trustee and  CRE asap ie in June if possible.  Preferably before we meet again with  PWC/Roth....  In addition to Pierre's comments, the PIM also states that strike prices at  least are subject to Trustee review but a number of areas need to be  questioned.  ? Capacity Release Phasing.  PIM confirms the 5 year period of the remdey but  also says a review can be requested after 3 years.  Bruno - you need to  review the remedy doc, but I do not see how a 2 year phasing of capacity  release complies with the remedy (at least in spirit).  We would suggest  there is no impediment to offering the FULL remedy in a single phase.  If  theere is insufficient demand they can always have a fall back position to  release unsold capacity on a 6 monthly or annual basis through the 5 year  period.  The current proposal is no more than EdF trying to minimise capacity  release and/or extract max value (can't blame them for trying but it is not  what we want or what remedy requires).  EdF's only real argument is that  phasing will allow more new suppliers to enter at a later date as eligiblity  threshold drops in France.  However, since eligible demand already exceeds  total capacity release this would limit development of competition to  existing eligibles.  As a minimum the release programme for all capacity  should be clearly defined up front; not at the whim of EdF.  Peter - thoughts  on this and how, in context of remedy, we can argue for accelerated single  phase auction (with possible reauctioning of unsold capacity over 5 years)? ? Auction Process : qualifying criteria likely to be more defined in IM; but  no obvious problems here.  I am less sure about nature of auction process.   We obviously need to think it through more, but why not just have a simple  process based on single sealed bids (or an electronic bid process).  The use  of price ""clock"" controlled by the auctioneer may allow a reserve price to be  set which is clearly not the intent of the remedy - this should be set at  zero for all product groups not subjectively ""to ensure excess demand"" but  only for certain groups! ? Product Specs : need to understand what if anything can be changed here.   Strikes seem to be subject to Trustee approval, but we need to understand  what else can be influenced eg within day flex.  Since we have already  covered this in previous submissions to MTF, EdF etc this should be easy to  identify as we go forward.  Any comments?

LONDON, May 31 (Reuters) - French utility Electricite de France (EdF)  announced on Thursday details of its first auction to sell electricity  production capacity to competitors. EdF was required by the EU Commission in  February to give access to some of its generation capacity as a condition for  EU approval of its purchase of a 25 percent stake in German utility EnBW. In the next two years, EdF will auction a total of 6,000 megawatts which  include 1,000 MW of peak capacity sold at a price of 26 euros per megawatt  hour (MWh) and 4,000 MW of baseload at a price of eight euros/MWh. In addition, 1,000 MW of cogeneration production capacity will be made  available. Production from cogeneration plants is bought by EdF from smaller  producers under long-term contracts. ""With such contracts, electricity suppliers and traders will be able to have  electricity without the technical and operational risks of running a power  plant,"" said EdF in a statement. The price for cogeneration capacity will be made public a few weeks before  the auction as it depends on gas price movements, EdF said. The auction will take place in several tranches, the first one starting in  September, when 200 MW of peak capacity will be auctioned, 800 MW of baseload  and 190 MW of cogeneration. The whole 6,000 MW should be sold by October 2003. EdF, which has a 94 percent share of the French generation market, has a  total installed capacity of 103,500 MW.   -----Original Message----- From:  Dindarova, Nailia   Sent: 31 May 2001 17:20 To: Gaillard, Bruno; Philip Davies/LON/ECT@ENRON Subject: EdF capacity auctions & other EU news  FYI see attached ---------------------- Forwarded by Nailia Dindarova/LON/ECT on 31/05/2001  17:07 ---------------------------   << OLE Object: Picture (Device Independent Bitmap) >>  ""Sandra James"" <Sandra_James@electricity.org.uk> on 31/05/2001 17:11:51 To: <david.love@british-energy.com>, <rob.plaskitt@british-energy.com>,  <shercock@compuserve.com>, <jgreen3@edisonmission.com>, ""Gwyn Dolben""  <Gwyn_Dolben@electricity.org.uk>, <KHanks@enron.com>,  <Nailia.Dindarova@enron.com>, <Peter.Styles@enron.com>,  <mwedg90@entergy.com>, <alison.cole@innogy.com>, <DAVID.TOLLEY@innogy.com>,  <peter.heffer@magnox.co.uk>, <ALAN.CLARK@natpower.com>,  <David.Burnett@nie.co.uk>, <Gordon.Dunlop@nie.co.uk>, <Chris.Price@pgen.com>,  <david.densley@scottish-southern.co.uk>, <shamblyn@seeboard.com>,  <Brian.Samuel@txu-europe.com>, <Phil.Hardy@txu-europe.com>,  <andy.papageorgi@uk.ngrid.com>, <christine.brown@uk.ngrid.com>,  <judith.ward@uk.ngrid.com>, <louise.petchell@uk.ngrid.com>,  <michael.metcalfe@uk.ngrid.com>, <James.Sheward@uuplc.co.uk>,  <Arthur.Probert@yeg.co.uk>, <gail.antrobus@yeg.co.uk>,  <Gail.Silcock@yeg.co.uk>, <joanne.bridge@yeg.co.uk> cc:    Subject: EdF capacity auctions & other EU news   Dear All  Please see attached news items from this afternoon, including details of  EdF's sale of capacity.

"Hi Rick,  I don't know.   Steve never did call that afternoon to discuss the leadership  issue.  (My comment to him will be that I would welcome him stepping into a  leadership role on these issues, but that he needs to step up to the plate.   This means being able to do Hill meetings on his own, being willing to step  back and re-evaluate our strategies from time to time, and looking beyond  Scott for policy and technical guidance).  I'm also planning to make some general comments to the group as a whole at  our EBS GA meeting in Colorado next week.  I think I need to talk about  individual versus group efforts.  The issues circling in my mind at the  moment are:  People need to realize that individual success does not happen independently  of the success of our group as a whole. This means that every person in our group needs to be able and willing to  work constructively will every other individual in our group.  No exceptions. Decisions about who attends meetings, whether with the FCC, Congressional  members and staff, or EBS executives will be determined according to  the  nature and purpose of the meeting.  That means that sometimes I step aside  for you or Linda or Steve Kean, and that sometimes one person in my group  steps aside for another.  Individual success in not measured by the meetings  that you attend.  It's measured by our effectiveness in achieving our agenda.  Anything else you can suggest that will help make clear to people that they  are focusing on the wrong issues and that this will have a serious negative  impact on their performance reviews.  I really would like to get beyond this point as quickly as possible.  Please  let me know if you ever think I'm wasting too much of your time with these  petty issues.  How's London?  Wayne and Zal have had a series of travel complications, so  I'm the only one in Argentina so far.  I had a very good day of meetings with  our lawyer yesterday.  We've rescheduled meetings with the Argentine  regulators for Wednesday afternoon, so that Wayne and Zal will be able to  make them.  This means only one day in Sao Paolo and one day in Brasilia, but  from all that  I've heard that's not a bad thing.  Talk to you soon.

I'm  not sure if she's done this yet and I didn't want to presume anything.  If it  works better to list your names individually I am happy to do that.

With the ""DC office"" appearing only in supporting roles on reports like  these, Rick and Steve Kean are going to continue to have the impression that  we exist to schedule meetings and execute plans formulated by others.  You  know this is a sensitive point for me personally, but beyond that, it is  important to my career development that I be seen as taking more of a lead.   I suppose Allison would feel the same way once she becomes more comfortable  and familiar with the issues.  Therefore, two requests.    Would you consider listing Allison and me as individuals, not as ""DC Office""?  Also -- and here I may be pushing it --  as you and I have discussed a couple  of times, am I taking the lead in the cable issue?  What about the BLM  issue?  I always appear to Rick and Steve to be supporting Scott on these  initiatives.  In my own twisted mind, I think of myself as having more of a  leadership role.  Sorry to continue to be ultra sensitive about this.  But frankly (just  between the two of us, please) since we've just brought on 2 new Senior  Directors in the past month (knocking me a couple of rungs down the seniority  ladder in one fell swoop), I am trying to increase my visibility ... and  maybe claim a little more credit for issues that I have before.

The Premier's office later denied he had used the word. But several Liberal and New Democrat MPP said they had heard him clearly,  despite the clamour from both sides of the legislature that erupted with Mr.  Phillips's attacks on the Premier. NDP deputy leader Frances Lankin described the incident. ""I am going to quote  the Premier. As he sat down he muttered 'And you are an asshole,' speaking of  Gerry Phillips."" She was one of several MPPs who immediately demanded that the Premier  withdraw the remark, as parliamentary procedure requires of any impolite  comment uttered on the floor of the legislature. Rick Bartolucci, Liberal MPP from Sudbury, had a similar recollection. ""He  clearly said, looking down but towards Gerry, 'You're an asshole.' "" The remark was not picked up by the microphones, as the one on Mr. Harris's  desk apparently was turned off. Attorney-General David Young was speaking at  the time, responding to Mr. Phillips's question. Nor was the remark recorded by the legislature's Hansard. Speaker Gary Carr said he did not hear it and noted that there had been a  general tumult in the legislature at the time that made it difficult to hear  any specific comments. Mr. Phillips's questions about Mr. Harris's role in ordering an end to a  native protest at Ipperwash Provincial Park, which resulted in the shooting  of Dudley George six years ago, generally result in outcries from MPPs on  both sides of the legislature. A statement from the Premier's Office disputed the opposition MPPs'  assertions that Mr. Harris had used profanity in referring to Mr. Phillips. ""The Premier has the utmost respect for the legislature and his fellow MPPs  on both sides of the House,"" it said. ""The allegation is false."" Government House Leader Janet Ecker defended the Premier. ""I didn't hear the remark. What I do know is many times members on all sides  of the House get a little heated up in debate. And everyone has said  something in that legislature that, on reflection, they perhaps wished they  hadn't said."" Last month, she was displeased when Liberal House Leader Dwight Duncan  accused her of throwing ""a hissy fit"" in the legislature. Opposition MPPs said the fact the Premier would use such language shows he  senses the damage a public inquiry about the shooting of the unarmed native  protester could do to his reputation. Mr. Phillips, who said he heard the remark but refused to repeat it,  commented: ""It's tragic. This situation involves a very serious matter. And  the Premier has chosen to try the personal attacks instead of trying to deal  with the issue."" The veteran Liberal MPP added: ""I've come to expect it from him now. . . .  It's completely in character for him. Maybe he thinks he can bully people and  get away with it. But I won't be bullied and most people won't be bullied."" Mr. Phillips had been asking the Premier why he is attempting to bankrupt Mr.  George's family by forcing them to proceed with a civil suit to uncover Mr.  Harris's role in the shooting.

"Rick:     As background to this meeting, I wanted to provide you  with my understanding  of the CFTC's current regulations:  Because EOL is a ""bilateral"" trading platform (one-to-many), the platform is  currently exempt from CFTC regulation, with the exception of the CFTC's  anti-fraud and anti-manipulation laws.     With the passage of the CFMA, energy derivatives are exempt from CFTC  regulation, except for certain minimum requirements.   While the CFTC can no  longer dictate how we structure energy swaps, we can only do business with  ""eligible contract (or swap) participants.""   Eligible contract/swap  participants must meet a net worth test of $1m (for business entities).  The  same net worth test applies to energy options (the CFMA eliminated the  ""physical handling"" requirement, which required participants to be in the  physical business before entering into energy option transactions).     In my non-legal opinion, the CFTC has jurisdiction over EOL as a bilateral  trading platform, and over financial transactions (whether or not they are  transacted through EOL, over the phone, etc.).   This jurisdiction would be  limited as discussed above.        Thanks.

As you are all probably aware, FERC staff will be conducting a visit to Enron  next Monday to discuss EOL and electronic trading's role in the energy  markets.   Dave Forester, Kevin Presto, and Phillip Allen will be giving  presentations about the EOL platform, power trading, and gas trading,  respectively.  In preparing for the meetings, the issue of which agency, CFTC or FERC,  regulates the EOL platform and any energy related financial products sold by  Enron (everyone agreed that physical deals through EOL were FERC  jurisdictional) came up.  It is unclear about Enron's current position.  While there is a strong case  that both the EOL platform and any energy related financial products are  regulated by the CFTC, some people believed that Enron had previously  informed FERC that they were the ""appropriate"" agency for the energy related  financial products.  We do not intend to make an issue of this topic with the FERC staff on  Monday, but rather wanted to make sure that everyone was on the same page  going forward.  Please let me know if we need to have a meeting to bring this to closure.  Jim  ",richard.shapiro@enron.com,lisa.yoho@enron.com,Re: EOL Regulation - CFTC or FERC?,2001-06-07 01:56:00-07:00,received

I am  awaiting material from Houston to complete the piece on  NYC.                         One piece that I think needs to be added to the  detailed briefing note is an overview of Enron's current commercial position  in Ontario - i.e. the renegotiation of the BE contract and the likelihood of  pursuing a retail initiative.  You will see where I have left space for that  piece, hoping that you could draft it.                     I have endeavoured  in the outline of the speaking points to focus on what we know the key  issues/concerns for  the government are at this stage.                      I  have asked Sasha Jacob to provide us with profiles of Harris, Wilson,  Purchase and Hubert to include in the final briefing package.                         I have prepared the material on the assumption that the best use of  the meeting time (likely 45 minutes with Harris and 60 minutes with Wilson et  al)  is: a)  to make  the  case for proceeding with market opening this Fall  if the IMO and OEB reports re market readiness are positive;  b) to provide  Harris et al with our perspective on developments in the U.S. (particularly  New York and California) about which the government may have continuing  concerns; and c) to ask Harris what we can do to help the gov't move forward  to a market opening this year.                              Rick Shapiro left  me a voice mail indicating that Lavorato and he had spoken about the visit  and the supporting material. The agreement  between the two of them is  evidently  that  Rob, you and I are  all to be comfortable with the briefing  material before sending it to John, who will then review it and propose any  changes he feels are necessary before it is forwarded to Ken  Lay.

"You have been sent this message from lisa.yoho@enron.com as a courtesy of the  Washington Post (http://www.washingtonpost.com). FYI. To view the entire  article, go to  http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A32756-2001Jun6.html Steel  Lobbyists Gain the Edge In persuading President Bush, a self-proclaimed free trader, to take steps  this week aimed at restricting imports of steel, lobbyists for the U.S. steel  industry used the threat that thousands of retired steelworkers in key states  would lose their health insurance if their companies closed.  The specter of an uprising by steel retirees, who substantially outnumber  active steelworkers, provided a potent political argument for the industry's  case that Bush should take drastic action to protect U.S. steel companies  from a worldwide glut even at the cost of tarnishing his free-trade image.  The argument was advanced by two top Republican lobbyists, Edward W.  Gillespie and Vin Weber, each of whom has been receiving $45,0! 00! a month from an industry-union coalition called Stand Up for Steel.  The coalition scored a smashing victory Tuesday, when Bush announced that his  administration will file a case with the U.S. International Trade Commission  seeking to win authority to set quotas on steel imports. And although many  factors went into the White House's decision, industry sources and other  participants pointed to the concerns raised by Gillespie and Weber as a  classic demonstration of how a highly motivated constituency can sway an  administration that barely won the electoral college and lost the popular  vote.  ""From a political perspective, this was not a hard case to make to a  government as closely divided as this one is,"" said Weber, a former  congressman, in an interview. Eighteen steel companies are ""in one stage or  another of bankruptcy. All those retirees are facing loss of benefits.""  Only about 150,000 people now work in U.S. steel facilities, but at some of  the biggest integrated steel! ma! kers -- which are in the worst trouble financially -- there are about six  retirees for every active worker. (The total number of retirees is slightly  more than 300,000, according to industry officials).  Adding to the political punch behind the Gillespie-Weber argument was the  fact that many of these retirees live in Rust Belt states that were hotly  contested in the last presidential election, including Pennsylvania,  Illinois, Ohio and West Virginia. The most fiercely contested state of all --  Florida -- is among the top eight states  in number of retirees.  A lobbyist who worked against the steel industry, Lewis Leibowitz of the law  firm Hogan & Hartson, ruefully gave credit to his opponents' political skill.  Leibowitz represents the Consumer Industry Trade Action Coalition, which  consists of companies that favor free trade on the grounds that import  competition helps keep costs low.  ""They did a lot, obviously,"" Leibowitz said, referring to Gillespie and  Weber. ""This is an! i! ndustry that has something like 160,000 workers, and the market [value] of  all the companies is smaller than that of Amazon.com, and they've turned this  town upside down. So my hat is off to them.""  The administration took other considerations into account, to be sure,  including the need to win support from steel state Democrats for  congressional authority to negotiate new trade agreements.  Jim Dyke, a spokesman for Commerce Secretary Donald L. Evans, asserted that  his boss was particularly moved by the pleas of union leaders who recalled  how their companies had shed workers and restructured in the 1980s only to  find themselves devastated anew by imports. Foreign steel shipments, which  account for about 20 percent of the U.S. market, reached record levels after  financial crises in Asia, Russia and Brazil in the late 1990s.  ""Factories are closing, and people are losing their jobs, because there's not  a level playing field,"" Dyke said, repeating the administration's argument! t! hat a major reason for the oversupply of steel on world markets is the  subsidies that many foreign countries provided when they established their  national industries. ""This fits in with the president's free-trade strategy.""  Capitalizing on the administration's decision, Evans joined in a news  conference/rally yesterday with such top labor leaders as John Sweeney,  president of the AFL-CIO, and Leo Gerard, president of the United  Steelworkers of America, both of whom backed Democrat Al Gore in the 2000  presidential race.  ""You can trust that we will be with you every step of the way until the  problem is fixed,"" Evans told the cheering crowd, which was reminded by other  speakers that the Clinton administration had balked at filing a case like the  one Bush intends to bring before the International Trade Commission. (The  Clinton administration, along with a number of industry lawyers, feared  losing the case at the time, but industry experts said another factor was the  staunch fr! ee! -trade stance of the Treasury Department.)  The Bush administration itself has balked at taking action that would  directly protect the benefits of steel retirees. The steelworkers union has  called for the government to create a fund that would help cover these   ""legacy costs,"" but administration officials said their moves to block  imports should help protect benefits by aiding the industry's revival.  The White House will now have to contend with the ire of U.S. trading  partners, which have reacted with a mixture of indignation and restraint.  Long Tong Yu, China's top trade official, told a news conference at a trade  meeting in Zhouzhuang yesterday that although ""China is concerned with any  protectionist practices or measures,""  it would wait to see whether the U.S.  action conformed with the rules of the World Trade Organization.  Akira Chihaya, president of Nippon Steel Corp. and the head of Japan's Iron  and Steel Federation, lashed out at the United States, saying he fears! t! he administration's move ""will encourage protectionism, which has been  spreading globally.""  But U.S. steel industry sources were crowing over the importance of a  professed free-trade president putting his imprimatur on an ambitious  initiative to save the industry. ""He must be choking, but he wants to win  elections,"" one industry official said.  <em>Correspondent Clay Chandler in Shanghai contributed to this report.</em>    ",richard.shapiro@enron.com,register@washingtonpost.com,A washingtonpost.com article from lisa.yoho@enron.com,2001-06-07 10:41:00-07:00,received

"FYI - column by Peter Foster of the National Post in today's paper.  Comes to  the defence of Enron and Ken Lay.   Eric Thode has been very helpful to Peter  and it has paid off. Also, I met with the Progressive Conservative Party  Advisory Committee on Energy  (a committee of non-elected party activists)  and they are preparing a report endorsing a Fall 2001 opening.  Economics 90210  Peter Foster National Post Dumb ol' Dubya. President Bush and his administration have been taken to task  this week by U.S. liberal economists and media sophisticates for being so  naive as to suggest that California's problems won't be solved by price  controls. That, sniffed last Sunday's New York Times, was just ""Econ 101.""  What the President needed was a lesson in Econ 90210, presented by the  Department of Sarah Polley-Sci. The bad news for Californians is that the shift of power to the democrats in  the federal Senate means that price controls become more likely, and with  them more blackouts. Meanwhile, the real causes of the California crisis -- a  screwed-up deregulation process exacerbated by environmentalist opposition to  new state power plants -- are buried beneath screams about gouging and  profiteering, and calls for an anti-corporate witch hunt. The call for price caps has allegedly been boosted by the support of a ""gang  of ten"" economists including Alfred Kahn, ""the architect of airline  deregulation under President Carter."" But price caps don't work. As President  Bush noted after meeting California Governor Gray Davis last week, ""[P]rice  caps do nothing to reduce demand and they do nothing to increase supply.""  However, according to another liberal economist, Princeton's Paul Krugman, we  shouldn't worry about prices because this summer will see blackouts anyway,  and in the longer term, new supplies are on the way via new plants, whose  arrival will somehow be magically impervious to the prospect of controls. Apart from being terrible economics, Mr. Krugman's attitude is even more  objectionable politics. At least he is frank about the reasoning behind his  support for price caps. They are intended to keep money out of the hands of  power suppliers. Meanwhile, he pursues the conceit -- disproven time and time  again -- that prices can be fine-tuned by bureaucrats to a level that will be  ""just enough"" to call forth the right amount of new power. ""Nobody,"" he  writes, ""has proposed capping prices at a level that would prevent power  producers from making extraordinarily high profits; why should this reduce  the power supply?"" Mr. Krugman suggests that students who go beyond naive old Econ 101 learn  that ""strictly speaking, the standard argument against price controls applies  only to competitive industry. A price ceiling imposed on a monopolist need  not cause a shortage; indeed, price controls on a monopolist can actually  lead to higher output."" This happens when the guy in the top hat throws up  his hands and says ""No point in me holding out for higher prices now that you  clever wonks have capped them, so just come in and take what you want. And  which way is it to the airport?"" Professor Krugman does have the good grace to note that ""That's not an  argument you want to use too often."" In fact, the argument is dangerous  nonsense. There is no ""monopoly"" supplier of energy to California (although  many state politicians have called for a government takeover of the  ""commanding heights"" of electricity generation, . la Lenin). Moreover, both  the economic and political arguments against price caps remain as valid as  ever. Price spikes require a buyer as well as a seller. To hold down prices  means that there will be excess demand and that constrained supply will have  to be allocated among competing uses by politicians and bureaucrats -- as it  was under the system of natural gas price and transportation controls that  brought the United States to crisis back in 1977. Meanwhile, the impact of  such essentially arbitrary controls goes well beyond their immediate skewing  of market signals. They damage the entire investment climate by raising the  spectre of further whimsical intervention, and by establishing an effective  ceiling to profitability without any corresponding limits to losses, except  for those with political pull. Professor Krugman asserts that ""generating  capacity is being added so quickly that the industry will soon face a glut.""  If that happens, we may be sure that Mr. Krugman will not be calling for  price supports. Mr. Krugman has been a leader among the baying pack that suggests that  California's problems are all due to market ""manipulation"" by big energy  suppliers. He concludes his display of economic obfuscation with the snide  assertion that President Bush's ""knee-jerk ideologue"" advisers may be ""so  close personally to energy industry executives that they believe that  whatever is good for Enron is good for America."" The presence in California  of Enron, the world's largest energy trader, has increased supplies to the  state, but according to California's attorney general, democrat Bill Lockyer,  Enron's head, Kenneth Lay, should be sent to jail. After all, he did raise  campaign funds for George Bush. And price caps and jail for business  executives somehow go together nicely.",richard.shapiro@enron.com,aleck.dadson@enron.com,Re: Ken Lay/John Lavorato Briefing Material,2001-06-08 02:01:00-07:00,received

Three  points:                               a) I am not sure what paper the IMO  Board  members may be referring to.  It could be the briefing note re Moving  Forward to Market Opening, the briefing note Satisfying the Government's Four  Guiding Principles, or the piece on resource adequacy and pricing that  Garrett Tripp prepared and that he and I have been delivering to senior  people in the government and elsewhere.  I attach those three papers in  electronic format.                          b) The briefing notes  above (and  the material we are preparing for Ken Lay and John Lavorato) address the  Pickering A point.  The suggestion that market opening is tied to Pickering  A  doesn't surprise me but is at odds with what Judy Hubert has been telling  stakeholders recently.  In any event, it is commonly thought that the  government may think that Pickering A will improve reliability and stabilize  prices.  There may, in fact,  be another reason.  One of our contacts in the  Premier's Office has indicated  that  Farlinger had told Harris that  waiting  until the return of Pickering was important from the perspective of OPG's  financial position.  On reflection, Garrett Tripp and I think that the  concern  likely relates to OPG's obligations under the MPMA - the concern may  be a)  that OPG may not be able to claim ""force majeure"" in respect of the  Pickering A delay in order to reduce their rebate obligations  ( definition  of ""force majeure""  in sec. 2(c) may not be broad enough) or b) that, even if  OPG  can claim ""force majeure"",  the predetermined ""force majeure replacement  cost"" fixed  at the time the MPMA was completed in 1999 may be too low to  offset the cost to OPG of securing replacement power in 2001-2002.   In other  words, OPG is asking the government to  intervene  in market  development/market opening to protect OPG from the terms  of the deal (maybe,  from OPG's perspective, now a ""bad deal"") that OPG made in 1999.  We should  discuss whether Lay and Lavorato can make this point to Harris (without  compromising our source).                       c) With respect to Foward  Markets , I think we have to distinguish between  a binding hour ahead  and  day ahead market which we may want to have the IMO run (assuming that this  will facilitate  and standardize trading among the Northeast ISOs - which is  a key objective in the East), but anything beyond that they should stay away  from.  I will speak to Rob Hemstock and to the folks in Houston who have been  working so hard on the RTO development in the Northeast.  Did  any material  get circulated as to what they want to do re forward markets?  In any event,  I think we should have a demo of Enron Online in Toronto for the IMO Board  and OEB.          `                                     Rob Milnthorp/ENRON@enronXgate  06/08/2001 12:11 PM        To: Aleck Dadson/TOR/ECT@ECT, Paul Devries/TOR/ECT@ECT    cc: Robert Hemstock/ENRON@enronXgate    Subject: IMO Meeting Highlights  Some Brief Highlights from the 06/07/01 IMO Meeting:   - Market opening, without question, is now tied to the bringing back of the  1st pickering unit. Govt is clearly not thinking november but the good news  is that they have made some statements locking them into may/02. We should  have our own intelligence re Pickering return but Boland told me that March  was highly probable.   - A number of positive comments re Aleck's paper from board members - Aleck  I'm not sure which paper they are referring to - can i get a copy.   - Forward Market development - IMO ""wants to make this happen"". Assessing  two candidates. I told the IMO that this is not their mandate and that a  conditional forward market exists currently and an unconditional forward  market will exist when we have a unconditional market opening date. I talked  re Alberta and indicated that the Alberta sponsored forward market was a joke  (WattEx) and that Enron and others had done 100's of forward market  transactions and the Enron has a visible forward market 24/7. ACTION - We  need to develop a position paper on why this should be left to the market  place and not some regulated central agency. The IMO should be concerned with  creating the right environment to promote an efficient forward market (ie  information disclosure, etc). OPG would support this position - we may want  to co-author the paper. I believe Hemstock/Davies did some work on this  already re Alberta. Let's discuss further.

Following the adoption of the EU Electricity Directive in= =20 December 1996, member states were obliged to transpose the directive into= =20 national legislation opening electricity markets to competition by February= =20 1999.  The directive sets out a three-tiered approach to the liberalisation of=20 electricity supply markets. Stage one entered into effect on 19 February=20 1997, and calls for the opening of 22% of national markets, based on the=20 average community share of electricity consumed by end customers using more= =20 than 40 GWh per year. The degree of opening will increase over six years by= =20 lowering the community consumption threshold to 20 GWh in 2000 (27% market= =20 opening) and to 9 GWh in 2003 (32-33% market opening).

Bruno  Updated May 2001.  Background  The Continental European electricity market is developing from an integrate= d=20 monopoly business to a competitive market. A segment of electricity users n= ow=20 have the right to choose their supplier from a range of marketers. The=20 emergence of new marketers and generators has created the demand for price= =20 risk management solutions and has encouraged the development of a traded=20 wholesale market. Following the adoption of the EU Electricity Directive in= =20 December 1996, member states were obliged to transpose the directive into= =20 national legislation opening electricity markets to competition by February= =20 1999.  The directive sets out a three-tiered approach to the liberalisation of=20 electricity supply markets. Stage one entered into effect on 19 February=20 1997, and calls for the opening of 22% of national markets, based on the=20 average community share of electricity consumed by end customers using more= =20 than 40 GWh per year. The degree of opening will increase over six years by= =20 lowering the community consumption threshold to 20 GWh in 2000 (27% market= =20 opening) and to 9 GWh in 2003 (32-33% market opening). Distributor access i= s=20 a matter for each member state. The implementation of a new directive,=20 expected in 2002, will improve the conditions for a liberalized market.  At present, the level of compliance with the directive varies between membe= r=20 states. The EU countries farthest along the process of liberalisation are= =20 Germany, Austria, Spain and the Netherlands. Switzerland, although it is no= t=20 an EU member state, is integral to market developments. France, although=20 having chosen to comply with the minimum requirements of the directive, has= =20 proven to open up their market more than expected.   =20  Current Market  EDF is the dominant electricity producer in France, the largest power=20 producer in the world with 475TWh generated in 2000,  and the largest=20 exporter in Europe (net exports reached 71 TWh in 2000).  Power generation = in=20 France is mainly nuclear (70%), but also hydro (20%), while conventional=20 thermal generation represents 10%. EDF is a vertically integrated company= =20 with services and products in generation (92%), supply (?%), transmission a= nd=20 distribution (95%). Finally, this historical supplier is a State Entity; th= e=20 French State owns EDF=01,s capital.  A few Independent Power Producers (IPP= ) are=20 also active in the market, such as Snet (6.4TWh, coal-fired), and CNR (16TW= h,=20 hydro). Other smaller IPPs are commercially active but most must sell their= =20 production to EDF under a regulated tariff.=20  More than 100 distribution companies are active through a concession regime= =20 in their local distribution area. Few, however, are of a significant size= =20 (less than a dozen have sales of over 400 GWhs), or have eligible customers= =20 in their concession areas.  The French System Operator (RTE) was created on 1 July 2000 and is a=20 sub-division of EDF, although it is unbundled in terms of management and=20 accounting. A postage stamp tariff has been implemented under the=20 transitional regime, which varies according to the voltage used and is base= d=20 on a matrix (Summer/Winter, Peak/Off-Peak). Users have to contract for thei= r=20 maximum transmission capacity. Imbalances are settled under a published=20 tariff, which introduces high charges for imbalances beyond a 10% tolerance= =20 level and 5MW.=20  A three-year framework contract (e.g., by way of a Master Agreement with a= =20 minimum term of three years) is required for eligible customers, but=20 eligibles are free to deal for shorter maturity transactions within such a= =20 three-year contractual framework. =20  Although the criteria for eligibility is per site, and eligible customers= =20 have to contract transmission for each site, RTE has created balancing=20 responsibility contracts (contrats de Responsable d'Equilibre) which compel= s=20 the aggregation of imbalance charges for different eligible sites within an= =20 equilibrium perimeter defined with RTE. Imbalances are settled under a=20 published tariff which charges a heavy penalty for any imbalance beyond a 1= 0%=20 tolerance level or 5MW.=20  Even though we are currently under a transitional regime in France, the=20 ability to trade power already exists. Optimisation can be found through=20 real-time arbitrage offered by the flexibility of the industrial process, t= he=20 availability of market prices and optional structures. The establishment of= =20 balancing responsibility contracts has created the basic conditions for an= =20 effective power trading market in France, and this through the exchange of= =20 blocks from one perimeter to another. Blocs are only exchangeable on=20 day-ahead bases but intra-day procedures are expected to be implemented. Al= l=20 transactions are currently based on bilateral physical contracts.=20  The establishment of this framework has contributed to an increasing number= =20 of players for trading, imports, exports and transit; we are confident that= =20 the French power market will develop rapidly.     Enron Capital & Trade=20 Resources Limited (""ECTRL"") is a balancing responsible actor in France and= =20 closed the first physical power transaction in France early 2000, and was t= he=20 very first new entrant to trade power (buy/sell) in France late 2000.   =20  Future Developments  << OLE Object: Picture (Metafile) >>=20 France's size and geographical position will make it a natural hub for=20 trading on the Continent. It is Europe's second largest electricity market,= =20 with net consumption (including industrial on-site consumption) totalling= =20 over 400 TWh in 1999. The increase of physical trading, envisaged capacity= =20 release by EDF, and creation of future market mechanism will contribute to= =20 the further development of the market.  Both a balancing market and a spot exchange market are expected to be=20 implemented by end 2001. Players in the balancing market will propose put a= nd=20 call options, exercised by RTE according to its own portfolio of contacts= =20 (producer, consumer) and providing it with physical balancing capacity. The= =20 balancing market will also show referenced market prices for balancing=20 services. =20 Some of the spot market volume is expected to be operated by ParisBourse.= =20 However, due to the dominant position of EDF, the limited number of active= =20 IPPs, existing restrictions for trading for authorised producers in France,= =20 and the lack of transparency with regard to current rules for allocation of= =20 cross-border capacity and attribution of congestion costs, we believe that= =20 the conditions for the creation of an effective spot power market in France= =20 are not yet fully met.=20  Recently, the European Commission has asked EDF to auction 6,000MW of virtu= al=20 capacity through VPP auctions starting in September 2001, representing abou= t=20 30% of the market for French eligible industrials This will further=20 contribute to increase liquidity.=20  Regulatory Environment  << OLE Object: Picture (Metafile) >>=20 The goal of Directive 96/92/EC concerning the internal market in electricit= y=20 is to obtain a cheaper but secure electricity supply by introducing and=20 gradually expanding competition while maintaining industry competitiveness = in=20 the face of price decreases.

Your comments are appreciated.  Thanks  Pierre   Updated May 2001.  1)Background  France is the second largest country in Europe with 58 million inhabitants.= =20 EdF, who was the monopolistic producer, is the largest power producer in th= e=20 world with 475TWh generated in 2000, thanks to nuclear production. The=20 historical supplier, who is at the same time the largest exporter of power = in=20 Europe (net exports reached 71TWh in 2000), is a direct emanation from the= =20 French State, who owns EdF capital. Power generation in France is mainly=20 nuclear (70%), but also hydro (20%), while conventional thermal generation= =20 represents 10%. EdF owns 92% of power generation, and 95% of distribution.= =20  A few Independent Power Producers (IPP) are also active in the market, such= =20 as Snet (6.4TWh, coal-fired), and CNR (16TWh, hydro). Other small IPPs sell= =20 their production to EdF under a regulated tariff. There has been significan= t=20 development of cogeneration projects since 1997. There is now 3,500MW of=20 installed capacity, thanks to the legal obligation for EdF to purchase powe= r=20 generated from cogeneration units at a preferable (is ""preferable"" the=20 correct word??)   tariff. In the view of the transposition of  the EU=20 Electricity Directive into French law, this purchase obligation ceased to= =20 apply for new large projects (over 12MW) from 1st Jan. 1999. More than 100 distribution companies are active through a concession regime= =20 in their local distribution area. Few, however, are of a significant size= =20 (less than a dozen have sales of over 400 GWhs), or have eligible customers= =20 in their concession area.  2) Regulatory Environment  The French Electricity law was passed on 10 February 2000, implementing=20 regulated third party access (TPA) in France under a transitional regime. T= he=20 law was approved one year late, failing to meet the required EU deadline.= =20 Dozens  [""Dozens""  - I would replace this with ""Several"")  of application= =20 decrees still have to be passed, including tariffs to eligible industrials.= =20 The French power market is open to competition, however. About 60 eligible= =20 industrials have so far switched totally or partly from the historical=20 supplier. Current threshold for eligibility is 16GWh (net of=20 auto-consumption) per year and per site, representing about 600 eligible=20 clients and 1,200 sites. The eligibility threshold will be reduced to 9GWh= =20 per site by direct application of the EU Directive in Feb. 2003, as the=20 French government declined a quicker opening of the power market.  Eligibility of distribution companies is limited to the eligible consumptio= n=20 of customers located in their concession area. =20 A three-year framework contract ( e.g., by way of a Master Agreement with a= =20 minimum term of three years) is required for eligible customers, but=20 eligibles are free to deal for shorter maturity transactions within such a= =20 three year contractual framework. =20  New IPPs have to be authorised through auctions or through direct decision= =20 from the Ministry of Industry, which is the main route for authorisation.= =20 Authorised IPPs in France are limited by Decree to trading buy for resale t= o=20 eligible customers a volume equivalent to 20% of the installed capacity,=20 including long term contracts. Trading is currently defined as the conditio= ns=20 of power purchase for resale to eligible customers. These Trading=20 restrictions, however, do not apply to ECTRL, as we are not registered in= =20 France. IPPs are free to sell and export power.  The French System Operator (RTE) was created on 1 July 2000 and is a=20 sub-division of EdF, although it is unbundled in terms of management and=20 accounting. A postage stamp tariff was implemented under the transitional= =20 regime, which varies according to the voltage used,and which is based on a= =20 matrix (Summer/Winter, Peak/OffPeak). Users have to contract transmission u= p=20 to the maximum capacity that they will use. RTE purchases excess capacity= =20 available through transmission contracts at fixed prices, which represents= =20 about half of the market price. Imbalances are settled under a published=20 tariff, which introduces high charges for imbalances beyond a 10% tolerance= =20 level and 5MW. Although the criteria for eligibility is per site, and=20 eligible customers have to contract transmission for each site, RTE has=20 created programme responsible contracts (contrats de Responsable=20 d'Equilibre), which allow the aggregation of imbalance charges for differen= t=20 eligible sites within an equilibrium perimeter defined with RTE.

ECTRL has actively been lobbying in order to have fa= ir=20 and transparent rules implemented for every player in the market and has=20 actively contributed for a spot market to take place.  However, thanks to an increasing number of players in France for trading,= =20 imports, exports and transit, we are confident that the French power market= =20 will develop rapidly.        =20  5) The Gas Market Situation  A transitional regime was implemented on 10 August 2000 by direct applicati= on=20 of the EU Directive, thus establishing regulated TPA for sites whose=20 consumption is over 25 million cubic meters p.a. The eligibility threshold= =20 will be reduced to 15million cubic meters in 2003, and 5 million cubic mete= rs=20 in 2008. No gas law has been passed yet (forecasted mid 2002), and its is= =20 expected that the transitional regime for gas in France will last until end= =20 2002. A zonal/distance-related tariff was disclosed published on 13 July 20= 00=20 by GdF-Transportation. A permanent entry/exit tariff structure is likely to= =20 be developed for 2003.  Charges  for imbalances are expensive, and access t= o=20 storage is restricted. GdF-Trading, however, has published conditions for= =20 balancing services.=20 There is only one trading Hub for France located at the French/Belgian bord= er=20 (Blaregnies/TaisniSres). Due to the distance-related nature of the=20 transportation tariff, competitive TPA is limited to eligible sites which a= re=20 located not too far (less than about 250Km) from the French/Belgian border.= =20 The main imports into France are for high cal gas, and GdF has published th= e=20 conditions for high cal/low cal gas swaps. As there is not yet a  [new??] gas law in France ( a Projet de Loi was=20 approved on 17th May 2000) transposing the EU Gas Directive into domestic= =20 legislation, the Regulatory Commission has not been appointed to-date , and= =20 the official regulatory body remains the Ministry of Industry.   =20 Although current conditions do not facilitate full requirement supply to=20 customers from new entrants, it is already possible to optimise gas supply= =20 through import of blocs for part or full supply.

We would suggest=20 there is no impediment to offering the FULL remedy in a single phase.  If= =20 theere is insufficient demand they can always have a fall back position to= =20 release unsold capacity on a 6 monthly or annual basis through the 5 year= =20 period.  The current proposal is no more than EdF trying to minimise capaci= ty=20 release and/or extract max value (can't blame them for trying but it is not= =20 what we want or what remedy requires).  EdF's only real argument is that=20 phasing will allow more new suppliers to enter at a later date as eligiblit= y=20 threshold drops in France.  However, since eligible demand already exceeds= =20 total capacity release this would limit development of competition to=20 existing eligibles.

"Rick:  This is a brief on the situation on the ground here based on observations and  short talks with the various colleagues in India Team.  I do have a meeting  with Wade tomorrow (June 13th) to understand his requests of support from  GA.  While I do not expect much,  I shall communicate to Wade the standing  policy of GA, namely, ""GA shall provide the required support"".   Notwithstanding this mandate, I shall communicate it in a manner to give  Houston the final say.     In the context of regulatory support, there two important areas for GA  contribution; they are: a) Dealing with the regulatory commission (MERC), and  b) third party sales.  It is likely that India shall need a week per month,  most conducted from Houston but may include a visit to Bombay.   The feeling here is that the company wants to terminate the PPA, and exit  India (but see point 5 below).  It is the understanding that there are teams  in London that are going through the reevaluation of assets in anticipation  to transfer them to MSEB as per the contract (MSEB has to agree on the  valuation which shall be a lengthy and an adversarial process).  It is  noteworthy that the transfer of these assets will not take place on market  basis, but rather on accounting basis.   As most chips are on terminating the contracts and exiting as the likely  route (around 60%), renegotiation is not discussed much (hastily added  however, renegotiation is the tacit direction of the lenders as communicated  in Singapore the other day in the lenders' meeting; they also want ENRON to  complete phase II which we are refusing).   If renegotiation is to take place, its crux will be the reduction in energy  and capacity costs to both phases and finding off-taker to Phase II (1400 MW  kit and caboodle).  NTPC, or PTC are the likely parties to assume such  responsibility.  Of course, we are trying to avoid any commercial risks  associated with marketing this power.  Whether we accept it or not, every  issue related to dispatch and transmission must be minutely determined and  solved.   The decision making process here is entirely dependent on Houston highest  level; that is directly from RMcDonald, and JS.  The fact that both of them  did not visit India and see for themselves how things are has been mentioned  as a minus point.  Perhaps this point should be communicated to them.   As mentioned above, GA contribution could be in two areas, namely dealing the  regulatory commission (MERC), and third party sales.  Starting with the  later, third party sales, it is perhaps the most important point in the  renegotiation as it shall increase the commercial value of our commitment  (incidentally, Enron's commitment in the project is between $0.65 and $0.825  billion--with B--depending on what to include and exclude).  Ironing the  issues for third party sales is clearly more valuable in the case of  renegotiation, but can also add value when assets are reevaluated and there  is a disagreement and some sort of market parameters are added.  As for  dealing with MERC,  it an ongoing basis particularly that MERC is seeking to  expand its jurisdiction in favor MSEB at every through of the dice.    I shall keep you posted with progress, meanwhile, please let me know if you  have any questions and/or advise.

Dean  was identified by Bill Hawkins as a key voice on the  electricity file.  He is someone I have been trying to see for two months.   He was very impressed by Garrett's presentation.  His comments were as  follows:  a) the mood in gov't is changing; b)  the  political environment  several months ago (California, high gas prices, and complaining industrials)  made it very difficult for the gov't to be making a decision at that time  to  move forward with market opening; c) Enron's message  has been getting  through"" very effectively"" (his words) ; and d) the political environment has  moderated considerably: the differences from California are understood, gas  prices have come off, and Pickering is evidently  on track.   He emphasized  that the gov't's announcement on April  23 was ""by"" May 2002.

As per Lavo, he wants 5 simple/straightforward and concise messages that we  can get accross to Harris. It needs to be short, to the point, concise, and  simple. By cc to Paul, Lavo is looking for our first draft TODAY (you and  Aleck need to agree on the speaking points - I provided you with my comments  already).   One further Item re the IMO Meeting that I didnt have time to communcicate to  you - At one point in the meeting Guolding stated that if one industrial or  one muni is not ready - the market will not open. I lost my mind, and told  him that if that is the case, I need to resign as this is a complete waste of  time and the market will never open if our CEO is telling the marketplace  that one rinky-dink muni can hold the entire market opening hostage. Without  doubt, it was the most frustrating/disappointing statement I've seen  Guolding/Baillie make - I'm sure Houghton was basking in all his glory after  that. I almost want to write a letter specific to guoulding and cc'd to  Baillie underlining who ridiculous a position this is for the CEO of the IMO  to be taking.      -----Original Message----- From:  Dadson, Aleck   Sent: Friday, June 08, 2001 11:32 AM To: Milnthorp, Rob Cc: Devries, Paul; Hemstock, Robert Subject: Re: IMO Meeting Highlights  This message came back to me (too big) - I am resending and will send  garrett's paper separately.  __________________  Rob, thanks for the comments from the IMO Board meeting.  Three  points:                               a) I am not sure what paper the IMO  Board  members may be referring to.  It could be the briefing note re Moving  Forward to Market Opening, the briefing note Satisfying the Government's Four  Guiding Principles, or the piece on resource adequacy and pricing that  Garrett Tripp prepared and that he and I have been delivering to senior  people in the government and elsewhere.  I attach those three papers in  electronic format.                          b) The briefing notes  above (and  the material we are preparing for Ken Lay and John Lavorato) address the  Pickering A point.  The suggestion that market opening is tied to Pickering  A  doesn't surprise me but is at odds with what Judy Hubert has been telling  stakeholders recently.  In any event, it is commonly thought that the  government may think that Pickering A will improve reliability and stabilize  prices.  There may, in fact,  be another reason.  One of our contacts in the  Premier's Office has indicated  that  Farlinger had told Harris that  waiting  until the return of Pickering was important from the perspective of OPG's  financial position.  On reflection, Garrett Tripp and I think that the  concern  likely relates to OPG's obligations under the MPMA - the concern may  be a)  that OPG may not be able to claim ""force majeure"" in respect of the  Pickering A delay in order to reduce their rebate obligations  ( definition  of ""force majeure""  in sec. 2(c) may not be broad enough) or b) that, even if  OPG  can claim ""force majeure"",  the predetermined ""force majeure replacement  cost"" fixed  at the time the MPMA was completed in 1999 may be too low to  offset the cost to OPG of securing replacement power in 2001-2002.   In other  words, OPG is asking the government to  intervene  in market  development/market opening to protect OPG from the terms  of the deal (maybe,  from OPG's perspective, now a ""bad deal"") that OPG made in 1999.  We should  discuss whether Lay and Lavorato can make this point to Harris (without  compromising our source).                       c) With respect to Foward  Markets , I think we have to distinguish between  a binding hour ahead  and  day ahead market which we may want to have the IMO run (assuming that this  will facilitate  and standardize trading among the Northeast ISOs - which is  a key objective in the East), but anything beyond that they should stay away  from.  I will speak to Rob Hemstock and to the folks in Houston who have been  working so hard on the RTO development in the Northeast.  Did  any material  get circulated as to what they want to do re forward markets?  In any event,  I think we should have a demo of Enron Online in Toronto for the IMO Board  and OEB.          `       << File: Market Opening Doc. feb 26 .doc >>  <<  File: Satisfying the Government's Four Guiding Principles.doc  >>                                 Rob Milnthorp/ENRON@enronXgate 06/08/2001 12:11 PM     To: Aleck  Dadson/TOR/ECT@ECT, Paul Devries/TOR/ECT@ECT  cc: Robert  Hemstock/ENRON@enronXgate  Subject: IMO Meeting Highlights   Some Brief Highlights from the 06/07/01 IMO Meeting:   - Market opening, without question, is now tied to the bringing back of the  1st pickering unit. Govt is clearly not thinking november but the good news  is that they have made some statements locking them into may/02. We should  have our own intelligence re Pickering return but Boland told me that March  was highly probable.   - A number of positive comments re Aleck's paper from board members - Aleck  I'm not sure which paper they are referring to - can i get a copy.   - Forward Market development - IMO ""wants to make this happen"". Assessing  two candidates. I told the IMO that this is not their mandate and that a  conditional forward market exists currently and an unconditional forward  market will exist when we have a unconditional market opening date. I talked  re Alberta and indicated that the Alberta sponsored forward market was a joke  (WattEx) and that Enron and others had done 100's of forward market  transactions and the Enron has a visible forward market 24/7. ACTION - We  need to develop a position paper on why this should be left to the market  place and not some regulated central agency. The IMO should be concerned with  creating the right environment to promote an efficient forward market (ie  information disclosure, etc). OPG would support this position - we may want  to co-author the paper. I believe Hemstock/Davies did some work on this  already re Alberta. Let's discuss further.

"Rick: I hope that all is well.  It was very nice to talk to you this morning.  The purpose of this note is to keep you abreast of progress in determining  the GA  needs for India, and seek your opinion for the best reply for Wade.   I look forward for your comments and advise.  Best regards  AI  Here are the salient features: Meeting with Wade: The meeting with Wade indicated that he is open to suggestions to what needs  to be done on the regulatory front.  He indicated that if GA sees, and  agrees, he would be happy to finance-on a semi full time basis--such support  from Houston.  His major concern is to satisfy himself that: a) all what  needs to be done on the GA front is being done, b) manage and maintain an  effective team (i.e., those currently employed in Bombay and Delhi Offices)  just in case of need.  He mentioned that  he is not going to be ""penny wise  and pound foolish"" given the $850 million at stake.  I informed him that  Houston shall advise on the best approach as soon as taking stock is  complete, and generally speaking, shall also deliver on what is needed.  GA Needs in India: The regulatory/government affairs needs in India are in the following five  areas:  a)  Third party Sales (basically for phase II output),  b)  Dealing with the Regulatory Commission,  c)  Dealing with MSEB (the customer),  e)  Government of India, and  f)  EBS.   The volume and intensity of work, however, shall differ with the following  scenarios, namely:  a) Enron/DPC intends to exit through arbitration, b)  Enron/DPC intends to renegotiate the contract, and c) Undetermined as of  yet.  Here is an assessment of this work load under the two former scenarios:          Arbitration  Renegotiation Third party Sales (basically for phase II output),   low/medium  high Dealing with the Regulatory Commission,    medium  high Dealing with MSEB (the customer),    medium  high Government of India, and      high   high EBS.         medium  medium  It is surprising to mention that most colleagues here say that Enron/DPC  seems to be taking the arbitration route, although that renegotiation (in the  sense of renegotiate, stabilize, then take hit on equity and exit), is the  best way.  It is more surprising, however, that no one can speak with any  degree of certainty on where the ship is going.  In this context, a  risk-averse person shall take the ""undetermined scenario"" as equal to  ""renegotiation"", while a risk-taker shall take the ""undetermined"""" as equal  to arbitration.    Personal: It is clear that the current personal here shall need support from Houston in  the ""renegotiation"" scenario on a semi full time basis.  Short of that,  a  visit every 6 weeks may  be adequate as the current team here will be working  under legal/commercial.    Suggested Approach: Continue understanding the details of the outstanding regulatory tasks for  the coming 3 to 4 days.  If the above opinion is still the same, then the  suggested communication to Wade (preferably from you) is ""if there is  renegotiation, then GA shall send the required person/persons on a semi-full  time basis, if arbitration, then GA shall be available on as needed basis"".    Caveat: It is not clear what does RMcDonald wants to see on the ground to tilt the  suggested approach above one way or another.    ----- Forwarded by Amr Ibrahim/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT on 06/15/2001 05:57 AM -----   Amr Ibrahim  06/12/2001 06:54 AM        To: Richard Shapiro/NA/Enron@Enron    cc: James D Steffes/NA/Enron@Enron    Subject: India - Progress Report One  Rick:  This is a brief on the situation on the ground here based on observations and  short talks with the various colleagues in India Team.  I do have a meeting  with Wade tomorrow (June 13th) to understand his requests of support from  GA.  While I do not expect much,  I shall communicate to Wade the standing  policy of GA, namely, ""GA shall provide the required support"".   Notwithstanding this mandate, I shall communicate it in a manner to give  Houston the final say.     In the context of regulatory support, there two important areas for GA  contribution; they are: a) Dealing with the regulatory commission (MERC), and  b) third party sales.  It is likely that India shall need a week per month,  most conducted from Houston but may include a visit to Bombay.   The feeling here is that the company wants to terminate the PPA, and exit  India (but see point 5 below).  It is the understanding that there are teams  in London that are going through the reevaluation of assets in anticipation  to transfer them to MSEB as per the contract (MSEB has to agree on the  valuation which shall be a lengthy and an adversarial process).  It is  noteworthy that the transfer of these assets will not take place on market  basis, but rather on accounting basis.   As most chips are on terminating the contracts and exiting as the likely  route (around 60%), renegotiation is not discussed much (hastily added  however, renegotiation is the tacit direction of the lenders as communicated  in Singapore the other day in the lenders' meeting; they also want ENRON to  complete phase II which we are refusing).   If renegotiation is to take place, its crux will be the reduction in energy  and capacity costs to both phases and finding off-taker to Phase II (1400 MW  kit and caboodle).  NTPC, or PTC are the likely parties to assume such  responsibility.  Of course, we are trying to avoid any commercial risks  associated with marketing this power.  Whether we accept it or not, every  issue related to dispatch and transmission must be minutely determined and  solved.   The decision making process here is entirely dependent on Houston highest  level; that is directly from RMcDonald, and JS.  The fact that both of them  did not visit India and see for themselves how things are has been mentioned  as a minus point.  Perhaps this point should be communicated to them.   As mentioned above, GA contribution could be in two areas, namely dealing the  regulatory commission (MERC), and third party sales.  Starting with the  later, third party sales, it is perhaps the most important point in the  renegotiation as it shall increase the commercial value of our commitment  (incidentally, Enron's commitment in the project is between $0.65 and $0.825  billion--with B--depending on what to include and exclude).  Ironing the  issues for third party sales is clearly more valuable in the case of  renegotiation, but can also add value when assets are reevaluated and there  is a disagreement and some sort of market parameters are added.  As for  dealing with MERC,  it an ongoing basis particularly that MERC is seeking to  expand its jurisdiction in favor MSEB at every through of the dice.    I shall keep you posted with progress, meanwhile, please let me know if you  have any questions and/or advise.

The biggest political  fear of the gov't going forward is that  consumers will see a big jump in prices once the market opens.  For  instance,  that fear underlies  the suggestion that  market opening should  await the return to service of the first Pickering A unit.  - the idea (right  or wrong)  is that Pickering will provide  greater reliability and price  stability. The biggest fear  of the  government - based on our discussions  with the politicians and their advisors  - is  the prospect of headlines in  the Toronto Star et al about high prices in the IMO markets, whether or not a  rebate is ultimately payable down the road. They saw the problems that  high  prices posed for Klein earlier this year and are fearful of being caught in  the same position. The Harris gov't is far more vulnerable than Klein  ever  was.   We are concerned that it  is not an adequate answer to the gov't's  political concerns  to say that high prices will simply increase the cashflow  to the government's own coffers (via OPG) to be redistributed at some later  date to  Ontario electricity consumers.  Remember that, in any event,  the  MPMA rebate is calculated on the basis of annual revenues and that estimates  are that consumers may not see an MPMA  payout until six months after the end  of the year.  Our own extensive analysis and our own forward curves for  Ontario indicate that significant price increases  (compared to the new OPG  bulk power rate of $48 MWh ) are unlikely.  This is a reassuring assessment  and we think it is important to share that view with gov't.   We can't rely  entirely on the existence of the mitigants; we have to address the underlying  concern about price spikes and high prices.  We think we have a good story to  tell in that regard.

He mentioned that  he is not going to be ""penny wise  and pound foolish"" given the $850 million at stake.  I informed him that  Houston shall advise on the best approach as soon as taking stock is  complete, and generally speaking, shall also deliver on what is needed.  GA Needs in India: The regulatory/government affairs needs in India are in the following five  areas:  a)  Third party Sales (basically for phase II output),  b)  Dealing with the Regulatory Commission,  c)  Dealing with MSEB (the customer),  e)  Government of India, and  f)  EBS.   The volume and intensity of work, however, shall differ with the following  scenarios, namely:  a) Enron/DPC intends to exit through arbitration, b)  Enron/DPC intends to renegotiate the contract, and c) Undetermined as of  yet.  Here is an assessment of this work load under the two former scenarios:          Arbitration  Renegotiation Third party Sales (basically for phase II output),   low/medium  high Dealing with the Regulatory Commission,    medium  high Dealing with MSEB (the customer),    medium  high Government of India, and      high   high EBS.         medium  medium  It is surprising to mention that most colleagues here say that Enron/DPC  seems to be taking the arbitration route, although that renegotiation (in the  sense of renegotiate, stabilize, then take hit on equity and exit), is the  best way.  It is more surprising, however, that no one can speak with any  degree of certainty on where the ship is going.  In this context, a  risk-averse person shall take the ""undetermined scenario"" as equal to  ""renegotiation"", while a risk-taker shall take the ""undetermined"""" as equal  to arbitration.    Personal: It is clear that the current personal here shall need support from Houston in  the ""renegotiation"" scenario on a semi full time basis.  Short of that,  a  visit every 6 weeks may  be adequate as the current team here will be working  under legal/commercial.    Suggested Approach: Continue understanding the details of the outstanding regulatory tasks for  the coming 3 to 4 days.  If the above opinion is still the same, then the  suggested communication to Wade (preferably from you) is ""if there is  renegotiation, then GA shall send the required person/persons on a semi-full  time basis, if arbitration, then GA shall be available on as needed basis"".    Caveat: It is not clear what does RMcDonald wants to see on the ground to tilt the  suggested approach above one way or another.    ----- Forwarded by Amr Ibrahim/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT on 06/15/2001 05:57 AM -----   Amr Ibrahim  06/12/2001 06:54 AM        To: Richard Shapiro/NA/Enron@Enron    cc: James D Steffes/NA/Enron@Enron    Subject: India - Progress Report One  Rick:  This is a brief on the situation on the ground here based on observations and  short talks with the various colleagues in India Team.  I do have a meeting  with Wade tomorrow (June 13th) to understand his requests of support from  GA.  While I do not expect much,  I shall communicate to Wade the standing  policy of GA, namely, ""GA shall provide the required support"".   Notwithstanding this mandate, I shall communicate it in a manner to give  Houston the final say.     In the context of regulatory support, there two important areas for GA  contribution; they are: a) Dealing with the regulatory commission (MERC), and  b) third party sales.  It is likely that India shall need a week per month,  most conducted from Houston but may include a visit to Bombay.   The feeling here is that the company wants to terminate the PPA, and exit  India (but see point 5 below).  It is the understanding that there are teams  in London that are going through the reevaluation of assets in anticipation  to transfer them to MSEB as per the contract (MSEB has to agree on the  valuation which shall be a lengthy and an adversarial process).  It is  noteworthy that the transfer of these assets will not take place on market  basis, but rather on accounting basis.   As most chips are on terminating the contracts and exiting as the likely  route (around 60%), renegotiation is not discussed much (hastily added  however, renegotiation is the tacit direction of the lenders as communicated  in Singapore the other day in the lenders' meeting; they also want ENRON to  complete phase II which we are refusing).   If renegotiation is to take place, its crux will be the reduction in energy  and capacity costs to both phases and finding off-taker to Phase II (1400 MW  kit and caboodle).  NTPC, or PTC are the likely parties to assume such  responsibility.  Of course, we are trying to avoid any commercial risks  associated with marketing this power.  Whether we accept it or not, every  issue related to dispatch and transmission must be minutely determined and  solved.   The decision making process here is entirely dependent on Houston highest  level; that is directly from RMcDonald, and JS.  The fact that both of them  did not visit India and see for themselves how things are has been mentioned  as a minus point.  Perhaps this point should be communicated to them.   As mentioned above, GA contribution could be in two areas, namely dealing the  regulatory commission (MERC), and third party sales.  Starting with the  later, third party sales, it is perhaps the most important point in the  renegotiation as it shall increase the commercial value of our commitment  (incidentally, Enron's commitment in the project is between $0.65 and $0.825  billion--with B--depending on what to include and exclude).  Ironing the  issues for third party sales is clearly more valuable in the case of  renegotiation, but can also add value when assets are reevaluated and there  is a disagreement and some sort of market parameters are added.  As for  dealing with MERC,  it an ongoing basis particularly that MERC is seeking to  expand its jurisdiction in favor MSEB at every through of the dice.    I shall keep you posted with progress, meanwhile, please let me know if you  have any questions and/or advise.

Re: PACE presentation ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?12:27 PM         David, here are some observations in response to your questions: a) You are correct that we would expect Ontario-based generators to pursue economic export opportunities in the connected US markets but we stress that the economics of such exports will be affected not only by the comparative generation costs, but also the cost of Hydro One's export and wheeling tariff, the IMO uplift and related charges charged to all load (including exports), transmission costs in the connected market, and any congestion costs arising in the event that the intertie between Ontario and the connected market is congested. ?Everything else being equal, this means that on average, power will trade within Ontario at a discount to prices in the U S connected markets. b) With respect to volatility, it has to be conceded that electricity is the most volatile of commodities. Having said that, the period of most serious volatility is the summer months. Moreover, we think it can be fairly said that volatility and price swings are moderating in the Eastern Interconnect largely as a consequence of the decrease in fuel costs (i.e. natural gas prices) ?and extensive new generation build - PIRA estimates that in Summer 2001 the year to year increase in ?available generation resources in the Eastern Interconnect is about 30,000MW. This all adds up to increased price stability. ? Again, my colleague, Garrett Tripp, and I would be ready to meet with your group at any time to go over these questions and our analysis in more detail. ?Give me a call if you would like to meet to discuss these points. ? 416 865 3707. ?Regards, Aleck      ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? david.matthews@cgc.en ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?bridge.com ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?

Re: PACE presentation        Thanks for the report. ?It helped to validate the PACE conclusion that there is sufficient supply to open the market without precipitating another California.   The report mentions that imports would not set the MCP in Ontario and that energy savings would be possible even if peak market demand was met by imports, while in another section it concludes that Ontario could rely on higher-priced imports to meet demand. ? The first two points seem to contradict the results from the IMO test runs, which indicate that the US markets will set the clearing price in Ontario 90 percent of the time, putting upward pressure on electricity prices in our market. ?If prices are higher in the adjacent markets, Ontario generators can be expected to export power to the more lucrative markets rather than bidding into the Ontario market, resulting in higher prices for Ontario since prices are determined on the margin. ?Price volatility and extreme price swings were also identified as concerns by MEUs.

Everything else being equal, this means that on average, power will trade within Ontario at a discount to prices in the U S connected markets. b) With respect to volatility, it has to be conceded that electricity is the most volatile of commodities. Having said that, the period of most serious volatility is the summer months. Moreover, we think it can be fairly said that volatility and price swings are moderating in the Eastern Interconnect largely as a consequence of the decrease in fuel costs (i.e. natural gas prices)  and extensive new generation build - PIRA estimates that in Summer 2001 the year to year increase in  available generation resources in the Eastern Interconnect is about 30,000MW. This all adds up to increased price stability.   Again, my colleague, Garrett Tripp, and I would be ready to meet with your group at any time to go over these questions and our analysis in more detail.  Give me a call if you would like to meet to discuss these points.   416 865 3707.

It helped to validate the PACE conclusion that there is sufficient supply to open the market without precipitating another California.   The report mentions that imports would not set the MCP in Ontario and that energy savings would be possible even if peak market demand was met by imports, while in another section it concludes that Ontario could rely on higher-priced imports to meet demand.   The first two points seem to contradict the results from the IMO test runs, which indicate that the US markets will set the clearing price in Ontario 90 percent of the time, putting upward pressure on electricity prices in our market.  If prices are higher in the adjacent markets, Ontario generators can be expected to export power to the more lucrative markets rather than bidding into the Ontario market, resulting in higher prices for Ontario since prices are determined on the margin.  Price volatility and extreme price swings were also identified as concerns by MEUs.   Were any of these concerns addressed in your presentation and are there any comments you can share?

"Some interesting feedback on Enron's entry into the steel market.   Hope  you're enjoying your vacation.  Lisa ----- Forwarded by Lisa Yoho/NA/Enron on 06/21/2001 11:20 AM -----   Thomas Sfikas/ENRON@enronXgate  06/21/2001 11:04 AM        To: Steel Distribution@Enron    cc: Jeffrey McMahon/ENRON@enronXgate, Raymond Bowen/ENRON@enronXgate    Subject: Steel Stradegies Conference - NYC 06/20/01  Yesterday, during the Panel V discussion, ""Why Have Steel Middlemen Gone From  The Most Threatened To Best Positioned"", we got some direct feedback on the  perception of Enron in the marketplace. The participants were, Fred Lamesh  CEO of Trademarked Inc., Michael Siegel, CEO of Olympic Steel, Bud Siegel,  CEO of Russell Metals, and Wilfred von Bulow, CEO of Ferrostaal Inc.; the  moderator was Peter Marcus, Managing Partners of World Steel Dynamics. Each  participant gave a brief speech about their respective companies which was  followed by a Q&A session. The first mention of Enron was during Michael  Siegal's speech in which he mentioned that Olympic Steel had ""sold material  to Enron"" and that ""Enron has recognized that steel is a commodity and for  many countries represents currency.""  Michael was clearly proud of his  transactions with Enron and agreed with our view of steel as a commodity. The real feedback came during the Q&A. Peter Marcus posted the following  question to the panelists. ""What about Enron? With their plan of entering the  market with a number of hubs across the country, stocking material, with  large scale distribution on a ""spot"" basis. Will this business model work? Do  they offer any real value or not?""  Following are the respective responses as best I can reiterate from my notes  ( please don't quote me on this): Fred Lamesh, TradeArbed: ""The concept is too new to make a judgment yet on  credibility. Enron has certainly been successful in the past and should not  be discounted. I question their ability to procure material at competitive  enough levels to make this a profitable venture but there may be some value  in their delivery of financial instruments."" Michael Siegal, Olympic Steel: ""Enron certainly has the financial means to  withstand a ""break even"" business to support their financial instruments. At  this point, we view them as just another entity in the market and until we  can evaluate their performance, it is difficult to determine value. I am  concerned though that they will prop up under capitalized distributors and  allow them to operate despite mismanagement. One interesting and unique  concept that they are trying to bring to the industry though is the idea that  a contract is a contract, with liquidated damages for non performance. That  would certainly be change (sporadic laughter among the crowd)."" Bud Siegel, Russell Metals: ""I addressed the Enron question last night during  dinner and was told that I was abusive to the young lady from Enron (Tammy, I  later understood that you had a less than cordial conversation with Bud the  previous evening). I am calling Enron the ""Hunts of the steel business"" with  their idea of buying up the market. The whole concept is like Swiss cheese.  You can not put up depots, buy from steel mills, and expect to sell the same  steel to distributors cheaper than the mills themselves. The logistical  expenses alone guarantee failure. You can not be everything to everyone.  Considering the current state of under financing in this industry, they will  inevitably end up financing bankrupt people and take credit hits. Without  immediate success, Enron has been known to exist markets quickly in the past,  and I believe they will be gone within the year.""(some sporadic applause)    Wilfried von Bulow, Ferrostaal: ""Right now they are just another additional  player in the market. They will certainly have an impact but it would not be  pragmatic to make a judgment yet on their ability to succeed. Let's watch it  and see if there is any value to what they are trying to bring to the market."" It appears to me that the focus on Enron in the market right now continues to  be more on the physical aspects of what we are doing and not enough emphasis  or credibility is being given to the financial tools we are bringing. It is  obviously very easy to poke holes in a concept of trading large volumes of  physical steel on a ""spot"" basis through the set up of physical hubs around  the country. In the end, the only way we will be successful will be by  bringing liquidity to our index through financial instruments. We need to  focus more on educating customers about our financial tools, developing our  curve, and bringing players to the market.

It was very nice to talk to you this morning.  The purpose of this note is to keep you abreast of progress in determining  the GA  needs for India, and seek your opinion for the best reply for Wade.   I look forward for your comments and advise.  Best regards  AI  Here are the salient features: Meeting with Wade: The meeting with Wade indicated that he is open to suggestions to what needs  to be done on the regulatory front.  He indicated that if GA sees, and  agrees, he would be happy to finance-on a semi full time basis--such support  from Houston.  His major concern is to satisfy himself that: a) all what  needs to be done on the GA front is being done, b) manage and maintain an  effective team (i.e., those currently employed in Bombay and Delhi Offices)  just in case of need.  He mentioned that  he is not going to be ""penny wise  and pound foolish"" given the $850 million at stake.  I informed him that  Houston shall advise on the best approach as soon as taking stock is  complete, and generally speaking, shall also deliver on what is needed.  GA Needs in India: The regulatory/government affairs needs in India are in the following five  areas:  a)  Third party Sales (basically for phase II output),  b)  Dealing with the Regulatory Commission,  c)  Dealing with MSEB (the customer),  e)  Government of India, and  f)  EBS.   The volume and intensity of work, however, shall differ with the following  scenarios, namely:  a) Enron/DPC intends to exit through arbitration, b)  Enron/DPC intends to renegotiate the contract, and c) Undetermined as of  yet.  Here is an assessment of this work load under the two former scenarios:          Arbitration  Renegotiation Third party Sales (basically for phase II output),   low/medium  high Dealing with the Regulatory Commission,    medium  high Dealing with MSEB (the customer),    medium  high Government of India, and      high   high EBS.         medium  medium  It is surprising to mention that most colleagues here say that Enron/DPC  seems to be taking the arbitration route, although that renegotiation (in the  sense of renegotiate, stabilize, then take hit on equity and exit), is the  best way.  It is more surprising, however, that no one can speak with any  degree of certainty on where the ship is going.  In this context, a  risk-averse person shall take the ""undetermined scenario"" as equal to  ""renegotiation"", while a risk-taker shall take the ""undetermined"""" as equal  to arbitration.    Personal: It is clear that the current personal here shall need support from Houston in  the ""renegotiation"" scenario on a semi full time basis.  Short of that,  a  visit every 6 weeks may  be adequate as the current team here will be working  under legal/commercial.    Suggested Approach: Continue understanding the details of the outstanding regulatory tasks for  the coming 3 to 4 days.  If the above opinion is still the same, then the  suggested communication to Wade (preferably from you) is ""if there is  renegotiation, then GA shall send the required person/persons on a semi-full  time basis, if arbitration, then GA shall be available on as needed basis"".    Caveat: It is not clear what does RMcDonald wants to see on the ground to tilt the  suggested approach above one way or another.    ----- Forwarded by Amr Ibrahim/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT on 06/15/2001 05:57 AM -----   Amr Ibrahim  06/12/2001 06:54 AM        To: Richard Shapiro/NA/Enron@Enron    cc: James D Steffes/NA/Enron@Enron    Subject: India - Progress Report One  Rick:  This is a brief on the situation on the ground here based on observations and  short talks with the various colleagues in India Team.  I do have a meeting  with Wade tomorrow (June 13th) to understand his requests of support from  GA.  While I do not expect much,  I shall communicate to Wade the standing  policy of GA, namely, ""GA shall provide the required support"".   Notwithstanding this mandate, I shall communicate it in a manner to give  Houston the final say.     In the context of regulatory support, there two important areas for GA  contribution; they are: a) Dealing with the regulatory commission (MERC), and  b) third party sales.  It is likely that India shall need a week per month,  most conducted from Houston but may include a visit to Bombay.   The feeling here is that the company wants to terminate the PPA, and exit  India (but see point 5 below).  It is the understanding that there are teams  in London that are going through the reevaluation of assets in anticipation  to transfer them to MSEB as per the contract (MSEB has to agree on the  valuation which shall be a lengthy and an adversarial process).  It is  noteworthy that the transfer of these assets will not take place on market  basis, but rather on accounting basis.   As most chips are on terminating the contracts and exiting as the likely  route (around 60%), renegotiation is not discussed much (hastily added  however, renegotiation is the tacit direction of the lenders as communicated  in Singapore the other day in the lenders' meeting; they also want ENRON to  complete phase II which we are refusing).   If renegotiation is to take place, its crux will be the reduction in energy  and capacity costs to both phases and finding off-taker to Phase II (1400 MW  kit and caboodle).  NTPC, or PTC are the likely parties to assume such  responsibility.  Of course, we are trying to avoid any commercial risks  associated with marketing this power.  Whether we accept it or not, every  issue related to dispatch and transmission must be minutely determined and  solved.   The decision making process here is entirely dependent on Houston highest  level; that is directly from RMcDonald, and JS.  The fact that both of them  did not visit India and see for themselves how things are has been mentioned  as a minus point.  Perhaps this point should be communicated to them.   As mentioned above, GA contribution could be in two areas, namely dealing the  regulatory commission (MERC), and third party sales.  Starting with the  later, third party sales, it is perhaps the most important point in the  renegotiation as it shall increase the commercial value of our commitment  (incidentally, Enron's commitment in the project is between $0.65 and $0.825  billion--with B--depending on what to include and exclude).  Ironing the  issues for third party sales is clearly more valuable in the case of  renegotiation, but can also add value when assets are reevaluated and there  is a disagreement and some sort of market parameters are added.  As for  dealing with MERC,  it an ongoing basis particularly that MERC is seeking to  expand its jurisdiction in favor MSEB at every through of the dice.

In my view, the concept would not/could  not  go forward and be implemented unless it had the support of OPG.  The  question we should talk through  is how do we best try to get that support  from OPG.                                        With respect to point 2, I  think we should be careful about being  too encouraged by Wilson's  /Purchase's comments  to Lay/Lavorato on June 19 that if positive reports are  delivered by the IMO and OEB in September, the gov't  will be hard pressed  not to move forward.  My concern is that Wilson and Purchase may feel  comfortable saying this precisely because they are expecting a negative  report from the OEB (or at least one that they can interpret as being  negative). I agree with you that the likelihood of the IMO delivering a  positive report is very good. The likelihood of a positive report from the  OEB is far less certain. The key issues  at the OEB/retail level are EBT, LDC  access to the data they need from HydroOne, completion of LDC CIS systems,   the gov't's interest in an industry resolution of  customer duplications  prior to market opening in order to avoid mass confusion in the initial  period of the market, the  state of customer education, and a contingency  plan to accommodate those who are not ready.                                -  with respect to EBT, I think the best we can do is get onside quickly with  our  EBT hub of choice  and work with them on perceived difficulties   with  LDCs, etc.  Ellis, Marryott and I are going to make a recommendation to Paul  next week on our preferred EBT hub.                          -with respect to  the info from HydroOne, I  have already raised this issue with the OEB and  the IMO. The OEB and the IMO subsequently met with   HydroOne and the MEA in  an effort to resolve this issue.  My understanding, until yesterday's  discussion with Conway, was that the issue was resolved  and the information  was now flowing to the LDCs. Paul, Garrett  and I are meeting senior HydroOne  execs (including Rod Taylor) on Monday re       resource adequacy issues and  we can press this with them as well.                               - with  respect to the CIS issue, there is not much we can do since most  LDCs  already have a CIS vendor; but my understanding is that at least   one CIS  vendor has backed out of its commitments to a number of LDCs recently (per  David MacFadden) and perhaps we can get a vendor   to move in quickly to fill  that gap. I will raise this with Marryott to see what may be feasible at this  stage.                           - with respect to the customer duplication  issue, I have already met with the senior people at Direct (last week)  to  discuss this issue with them and to  propose a resolution that would see the  retailers involved retaining a third party  (such as E&Y)  to assess the  degree of overlap and whether   there was an acceptable solution to any  problem. Direct is convinced that the degree of duplication is not high.   Direct is talking to Onsource   and Toronto about this.  I am checking with  our staff in the UK about whether there was a similar issue when the UK  market opened and, if so, how it was  resolved.  .                                      -with respect to customer education, I  and Dick Perdue (Direct's advisor) have contacted TransAlta, OPG, HydroOne,  Onsource, Enersource,   and Toronto about funding a  Province- wide consumer  education initiative over the summer.  We are meeting next week to discuss  this idea    further.  This could require a financial commitment from Enron  of  up to $200,000.                              - with respect to the  contingency plan to deal with those LDCs who are not ready, the OEB is  already on side in recognizing the need for a contingency  plan - it will  likely be very simple: the IMO  would send a bill to the LDC each month and  the LDC would bill customers at some fixed rate, with a deferral  account).  The key  issue will be how many LDCs (in terms of numbers and size)  are not  ready and what is the minimum number of LDCs that   the OEB/gov't is looking  for to be ready. This is an issue we will have to talk to the MEST about as  well as the OEB , since ultimately the    decision of whether enough LDCs are  ready will be a political one.                             These are the  OEB/retail focussed things we are doing.  On the  larger political front, I  have several  ideas about some things  I would like to do that I can discuss  with you and Paul.

It was very nice to talk to you this morning.  The purpose of this note is to keep you abreast of progress in determining the GA  needs for India, and seek your opinion for the best reply for Wade.  I look forward for your comments and advise.  Best regards  AI  Here are the salient features: Meeting with Wade: The meeting with Wade indicated that he is open to suggestions to what needs to be done on the regulatory front.  He indicated that if GA sees, and agrees, he would be happy to finance-on a semi full time basis--such support from Houston.  His major concern is to satisfy himself that: a) all what needs to be done on the GA front is being done, b) manage and maintain an effective team (i.e., those currently employed in Bombay and Delhi Offices) just in case of need.  He mentioned that  he is not going to be ""penny wise and pound foolish"" given the $850 million at stake.  I informed him that Houston shall advise on the best approach as soon as taking stock is complete, and generally speaking, shall also deliver on what is needed.  GA Needs in India: The regulatory/government affairs needs in India are in the following five areas:  a)  Third party Sales (basically for phase II output),  b)  Dealing with the Regulatory Commission,  c)  Dealing with MSEB (the customer),  e)  Government of India, and  f)  EBS.   The volume and intensity of work, however, shall differ with the following scenarios, namely:  a) Enron/DPC intends to exit through arbitration, b) Enron/DPC intends to renegotiate the contract, and c) Undetermined as of yet.  Here is an assessment of this work load under the two former scenarios:          Arbitration  Renegotiation Third party Sales (basically for phase II output),   low/medium  high Dealing with the Regulatory Commission,    medium  high Dealing with MSEB (the customer),    medium  high Government of India, and      high   high EBS.         medium  medium  It is surprising to mention that most colleagues here say that Enron/DPC seems to be taking the arbitration route, although that renegotiation (in the sense of renegotiate, stabilize, then take hit on equity and exit), is the best way.  It is more surprising, however, that no one can speak with any degree of certainty on where the ship is going.  In this context, a risk-averse person shall take the ""undetermined scenario"" as equal to ""renegotiation"", while a risk-taker shall take the ""undetermined"""" as equal to arbitration.    Personal: It is clear that the current personal here shall need support from Houston in the ""renegotiation"" scenario on a semi full time basis.  Short of that,  a visit every 6 weeks may  be adequate as the current team here will be working under legal/commercial.    Suggested Approach: Continue understanding the details of the outstanding regulatory tasks for the coming 3 to 4 days.  If the above opinion is still the same, then the suggested communication to Wade (preferably from you) is ""if there is renegotiation, then GA shall send the required person/persons on a semi-full time basis, if arbitration, then GA shall be available on as needed basis"".    Caveat: It is not clear what does RMcDonald wants to see on the ground to tilt the suggested approach above one way or another.    ----- Forwarded by Amr Ibrahim/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT on 06/15/2001 05:57 AM -----    Amr Ibrahim 06/12/2001 06:54 AM     To: Richard Shapiro/NA/Enron@Enron  cc: James D Steffes/NA/Enron@Enron  Subject: India - Progress Report One    Rick:  This is a brief on the situation on the ground here based on observations and short talks with the various colleagues in India Team.  I do have a meeting with Wade tomorrow (June 13th) to understand his requests of support from GA.  While I do not expect much,  I shall communicate to Wade the standing policy of GA, namely, ""GA shall provide the required support"".  Notwithstanding this mandate, I shall communicate it in a manner to give Houston the final say.     In the context of regulatory support, there two important areas for GA contribution; they are: a) Dealing with the regulatory commission (MERC), and b) third party sales.  It is likely that India shall need a week per month, most conducted from Houston but may include a visit to Bombay.

Rick - I just got a call from Ian Fletcher, head of the Utilities Regulation  unit at the UK Department of Trade and Industry.  He reports to Anna Walker,  the Director General of Energy at the DTI.  Ian also knows Paul, and I am  sure that he only called me because he now knew of my US location.  Anyway,  here is what he asked:  They have a highly regarded junior civil servant,  Edward Barker (Paul and I have both met him, and rate him high), who is  getting married, and wants to locate to Los Angeles for a year while his  fiance/wife completes a Ph.D. at some school there.  The UK DTI will keep  paying him, so he is effectively free to us.  They want a relevant job/work  experience for him.  Ian does not know about his willingness to commute  during the week from San Francisco to LA (I told Ian we were receptive to  these kinds of things, if all else worked out), but will check.  I think it  would be good for Enron (Paul D. may have views on this), not only for  endearing Enron to key relationships at DTI, but exposing a UK civil servant  to the transparency of our regulation, US-style, cannot hurt either, as that  is something Paul is on a long march to improve in the UK.  I would think  challenging research, attendance at settlement conferences, some memo  writing, etc. would be sufficient (actually, that would be a bit below the  policy-formation role he now occupies), but do you have any thoughts?

It is indeed quite an encouraging read. Whereas  the press release sent out before (attached here below as well) suggested  that the Commission ""would consider"" adopting its own Directive under the  provisions of Art. 86 (para 3), the minutes seem to go a step further and  imply that the Commissions regards it as a next action for itself if the  Council and the Parliament delay the adoption of the acceleration proposal.  The text also emphasizes that the Commission's legislation will still have to  be subject to the ""obligations of services of general economic interest"",  which could of course have a negative impact on the content of the actual  Directive.

The official has also indicated that the document seeks to push for the adoption of the Commission proposals for the completion of the energy internal market which will allow to put an end to the current distortions. According to the press release the Commission intends to apply the Treaty's competition rules in the energy sector and would consider to adopt Decisions or Directive itself to address possible distortions of competition resulting from different levels of liberalisation.

"This was an article written in response to the piece by Prof Krugman in the  New York Times several weeks ago. I know that Foster spent some time on the  phone with Steve and Mark before writing the article.  ----- Forwarded by Aleck Dadson/TOR/ECT on 06/26/2001 08:40 AM -----   Dan Dorland  06/08/2001 08:54 AM        To: Paul Devries/TOR/ECT@ECT, Jan Wilson/TOR/ECT@ECT, Jeff Borg/TOR/ECT@ECT,  Dave Ellis/TOR/ECT@ECT, Aleck Dadson/TOR/ECT@ECT, Garrett Tripp/TOR/ECT@ECT    cc:     Subject: Economics 90210      Economics 90210  Peter Foster National Post Dumb ol' Dubya. President Bush and his administration have been taken to task  this week by U.S. liberal economists and media sophisticates for being so  naive as to suggest that California's problems won't be solved by price  controls. That, sniffed last Sunday's New York Times, was just ""Econ 101.""  What the President needed was a lesson in Econ 90210, presented by the  Department of Sarah Polley-Sci. The bad news for Californians is that the shift of power to the democrats in  the federal Senate means that price controls become more likely, and with  them more blackouts. Meanwhile, the real causes of the California crisis -- a  screwed-up deregulation process exacerbated by environmentalist opposition to  new state power plants -- are buried beneath screams about gouging and  profiteering, and calls for an anti-corporate witch hunt. The call for price caps has allegedly been boosted by the support of a ""gang  of ten"" economists including Alfred Kahn, ""the architect of airline  deregulation under President Carter."" But price caps don't work. As President  Bush noted after meeting California Governor Gray Davis last week, ""[P]rice  caps do nothing to reduce demand and they do nothing to increase supply.""  However, according to another liberal economist, Princeton's Paul Krugman, we  shouldn't worry about prices because this summer will see blackouts anyway,  and in the longer term, new supplies are on the way via new plants, whose  arrival will somehow be magically impervious to the prospect of controls. Apart from being terrible economics, Mr. Krugman's attitude is even more  objectionable politics. At least he is frank about the reasoning behind his  support for price caps. They are intended to keep money out of the hands of  power suppliers. Meanwhile, he pursues the conceit -- disproven time and time  again -- that prices can be fine-tuned by bureaucrats to a level that will be  ""just enough"" to call forth the right amount of new power. ""Nobody,"" he  writes, ""has proposed capping prices at a level that would prevent power  producers from making extraordinarily high profits; why should this reduce  the power supply?"" Mr. Krugman suggests that students who go beyond naive old Econ 101 learn  that ""strictly speaking, the standard argument against price controls applies  only to competitive industry. A price ceiling imposed on a monopolist need  not cause a shortage; indeed, price controls on a monopolist can actually  lead to higher output."" This happens when the guy in the top hat throws up  his hands and says ""No point in me holding out for higher prices now that you  clever wonks have capped them, so just come in and take what you want. And  which way is it to the airport?"" Professor Krugman does have the good grace to note that ""That's not an  argument you want to use too often."" In fact, the argument is dangerous  nonsense. There is no ""monopoly"" supplier of energy to California (although  many state politicians have called for a government takeover of the  ""commanding heights"" of electricity generation, . la Lenin). Moreover, both  the economic and political arguments against price caps remain as valid as  ever. Price spikes require a buyer as well as a seller. To hold down prices  means that there will be excess demand and that constrained supply will have  to be allocated among competing uses by politicians and bureaucrats -- as it  was under the system of natural gas price and transportation controls that  brought the United States to crisis back in 1977. Meanwhile, the impact of  such essentially arbitrary controls goes well beyond their immediate skewing  of market signals. They damage the entire investment climate by raising the  spectre of further whimsical intervention, and by establishing an effective  ceiling to profitability without any corresponding limits to losses, except  for those with political pull. Professor Krugman asserts that ""generating  capacity is being added so quickly that the industry will soon face a glut.""  If that happens, we may be sure that Mr. Krugman will not be calling for  price supports. Mr. Krugman has been a leader among the baying pack that suggests that  California's problems are all due to market ""manipulation"" by big energy  suppliers. He concludes his display of economic obfuscation with the snide  assertion that President Bush's ""knee-jerk ideologue"" advisers may be ""so  close personally to energy industry executives that they believe that  whatever is good for Enron is good for America."" The presence in California  of Enron, the world's largest energy trader, has increased supplies to the  state, but according to California's attorney general, democrat Bill Lockyer,  Enron's head, Kenneth Lay, should be sent to jail. After all, he did raise  campaign funds for George Bush. And price caps and jail for business  executives somehow go together nicely.

He will be speaking  for 50 minutes and then the floor will be open for discussion.

We are expecting comments from Europe regarding the talking points by  tomorrow morning.

It was then suggested that the effective date should be subsequent to whatever date a decision is issued.  Watson responded indicating agreement but pointing out that it was Wood, not Bilas, who was suspending DA and that Serizawa needed to respond.  Serizawa's only response was to remind me that the email was an ex parte contact and needed to be filed, which I already knew, of course.

"Dear Mr Shapiro   I'm e-mailing you at the suggestion of Paul Dawson in London. My colleague  Ian Fletcher has discussed with Mark Schroeder and Paul the possibility of  arranging a secondment to Enron from my current post at the UK Government's  Department of Trade & Industry (DTI).   I am hoping to arrange a suitable posting to start late September 2001 and to  last around two years. I would optimally like to be based in or around Los  Angeles (so that I can live with my wife who will be in LA for the next two  years) but understand that for Enron San Francisco is likely to be the  closest location with any openings.  I attach a copy of my CV which outlines my experience, skills and  achievements to date. You will see that I have already established a  successful and varied career in the public sector - most recently in the  energy sector. At this point I am looking for an opportunity to acquire real  commercial experience using the skills I've already proved, whilst building  up new ones.   My colleague Maureen Verrall +44 (0) 20 7215 8022 manages the DTI's  secondment team and would be able to talk through the practical and financial  details.  Would it be possible for us to have a phone conversation at some point in the  next few days? My direct office number is +44 (0) 20 7215 0237 or I could  call you if that would be more convenient.

In general my assumptions and thoughts are as follows....  a) Medium term, we need to move in the direction of having local nationals -  instead of AngloSaxons - as our  lead face deep in the Germanic regulatory arena.  Styles & Hennemeyer will,  no doubt, continue to have  significant leadership roles; but, there is no substitute for locals. b) As the markets get more liquid, especially as clearer national and  regulatory bodies become established, the  opportunity for RegAffairs value add increases - not decreases.  Greater  liquidity and transparency will   increase the relative importance of transmission conditions. c) Market concentration is a big problem and will get much bigger.  This will  occupy a lot of time over the next few  years. d) Inevitably, some of the people we hire will go commercial, others will not  work-out and others will leave Enron.  If we try for 6 to 8, we will be lucky to get 3 or 4 by year end.  Of that,  we will be lucky if 2 or 3 are successful  RegAffairs people 2 years later.  It takes 2 years to grow our own top  quality professional.  We are behind. e) The gas market has only begun to move.  After a two year fight in that  market we will then have to content with  gas/power convergence which will introduce yet a new set of concentration  and transmission and plant siting  issues. f) Historically, our RegAffairs people have been our most effective  communicators in the public arena including  the media.  As liquidity increases, the pressure to do deals will grow  exponentially on commercial leads with  the result that they will step further and further away from the public  communicatioins arena.  But, particularly  in Europe, we will continue for a long time to need to maintain a certain  level of public profile.  Best done by  a RegAffairs person rather than someone who should be out doing a deal.  I will call later this morning.  Thanks.

"Paul - thanks for forwarding.  Rick I don't know if this is material for Steve's meeting, but may be of interest  to you anyway. Given our increasing confidence that the Arcos capacity isssue is settled,  John Sheriff & Michael Brown indicated that they may consider another  regulatory battle in Europe, possibly on gas, and have asked Paul Hennemeyer  & me to draw up a list of possible complaints.  As you know, Germany is  probably our biggest problem area, but that may not mean this is the battle  we want to fight first. Significantly, the European Commission is losing patience with Germany.  I  attended the European Gas Regulatory Forum in Madrid this week (consists of  delegates from member states gas regulators, ministries, the Commission and  groups representing Gas Transmission Enterprises, consumer groups, offshore  gas producers, incumbent suppliers, European Federation of Energy Traders.   The representative from the German ministry was unbelievably outspoken about  refusing to agree that consensus had been reached on anything, and supported  GTE's refusal to publish any information on available capacity, transparent  terms of access.  They also refused to recognise that the Council of European  Energy Regulators might have any authority over Germany as they had chosen to  go down a different route.  Political patience is clearly running out and the  Commission is considering how they might use powers under Article 86 to  progress either the proposed acceleratino directive or a new directive on  information disclosure, in spite of Germany.  (Brendan says they have already  used these powers in telecomms).

Worth a look  Link to the DWR Contracts.   http://www.sco.ca.gov/power_page/contract_info.htm  Ban   An interesting article too:  Connell: Power cost twice Davis' figure  July 6, 2001  By JOHN HOWARD The Orange County Register  SACRAMENTO -- The average cost of electricity purchased under $43 billion of  worth of state contracts is actually more than double the amount reported by  Gov. Gray Davis' administration, state Controller Kathleen Connell said  Thursday.  Connell said her staff's analysis put the per-megawatt average at $170,  compared with $69 to $79 estimated by Davis.  Connell stopped short of suggesting that the higher cost could drive another  increase in rates, although consumer groups said the higher amount likely  would require some future increase.  The controller, who writes the state's checks, said her figures assume fixed  prices for natural gas over the duration of the contracts, which range from a  few months to 20 years.  The administration, noting that nearly half its contracts are pegged to the  fluctuating market price of natural gas, said costs on many of the contracts  would decline over time.  Consumer groups were skeptical of the administration's numbers.  ""You could cut these numbers in various ways and make different averages,  long-range or short-range contracts, peak power or nonpeak, and probably  either average could be defended mathematically,"" said Nettie Hoge of The  Utility Reform Network. ""We can't tell you whether it's $69 or $170 - the  contracts are very convoluted and complex.""

The purpose of the meeting was to brief us on their activities and their gameplan for trying to find a solution for California.  Here's a summary of the meeting.  Please keep confidential.  Work will be done over the weekend to put the core/noncore proposal in legislative language.  (We will be in the room.) Work done by the ""Plan B"" group in the Assembly (Joe Dutra and Joe Nation) will also be put into legislative language over the weekend. Because no proposal is ""comprehensive,"" a complete legislative package will be created from the various pieces that have been worked on thus far (i.e., core/noncore, ""Plan B,"" Edison MOU) In addition, there are Republican demands that Hertzberg will need to address (e.g., end the litigation) in order to achieve bi-partison support, which is what Hertzberg's shooting for.  To move the legislation, the plan is to establish a ""conference committee,"" comprised of an equal number of Democrats and Republicans. The committe would begin work on Monday and would attempt to finish putting a comprehensive bill together, vote it out of the Legislature and send it to the Governor for signing by Monday, July 16th. July 16th is the deadline because that is the date that the PUC will issue its proposed decision regarding, among other things, how DWR's revenue requirement will be put into rates, whether Direct Access needs to be suspended, etc. The PUC is issuing the draft on the 16th in order to give everyone 30 days to review and comment before the Commission votes on a final order on August 15th.  (The PUC will actually issue a ""thought piece"" on Monday the 9th and will use reactions to the ""thought piece"" to craft the develop the proposed decision it plans to issue on the 16th.) All of this is still up in the air, however.  As of right now, the leader of the Senate (Burton) has not agreed to Hertzberg's gameplan and the Republicans, while interested, have not yet committed to join the process.           <Embedded StdOleLink> <Embedded StdOleLink>",richard.shapiro@enron.com,jeff.dasovich@enron.com,Re: California Update--Legislative Push Underway,2001-07-06 19:01:00-07:00,received

Assemblyman Bill Leonard's most recent e-newsletter contained the following information.  I think it is very interesting to consider in light of the present energy situation in California and the comments of our present Governor.  Regards, Curt  ---------------------------------------------   ***Who Really Powers California?*** Governor Davis has made no secret that he believes that swashbuckling, cattle rustling, energy barons from Texas are to blame for our energy crisis.  While Texas power companies make for good bad guys in the Governor's transparent Kabuki theater of blame, Leonard Letter readers may be interested to see who really provides power to Californians.  The following list illustrates what percentage of our power supply each group of generators provides. (Editor's note: these percentages have been rounded up resulting in slightly more than 100%)  18%- Pacific Gas and Electric (California) 15%- Southern California Edison (California) 11%- Imported power from the Northwest (including Canada) 10%- Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (California) 10%- Imported power from the Southwest 7%- State and Federal Agencies 6%- AES power company 5%- Municipal Utilities and Irrigation Districts 5%- Reliant power company 4%- Duke power company 4%- Southern power company 4%- Dynegy power company 1%- Sacramento Municipal Utility District (California) 1%- Calpine power company 1%- San Diego Gas and Electric (California)   It should be noted that of this list, only Dynegy and Reliant are from Texas.  These two companies represent a total of 9% of California's energy portfolio.  By comparison, Georgia-based Southern (Mirant), Virginia's AES, and North Carolina's Duke Energy, have a 14% share of our energy portfolio.  This list does not focus on who is gaming the market.  However, every provider listed benefited from skyrocketing energy prices.  In trying to identify those power producers who used market power to ring up high profits on Californians, we should include ALL power producers in our investigations.  State and federal agencies, independent power companies, utilities, municipal utilities, and even local irrigation districts could all be guilty of gouging consumers.  Davis's focusing on only those companies from Texas does everyone in this state a disservice and is a misrepresentation of fact.  ------------------------------  Curt Pringle Curt Pringle & Assoc. 2532 Dupont Drive Irvine, CA 92612  (949) 474-4090 (949) 474-4082 fax  ","steven.kean@enron.com, james.steffes@enron.com, jeff.dasovich@enron.com,   susan.mara@enron.com",richard.shapiro@enron.com,FW: where does our energy come from?,2001-07-10 00:52:00-07:00,sent

If the economic and political environment gets calmer, these rules  will be an important step in the power deregulation process an will allow us  to reach some of the goals set for the regulatory group for this year.  Goal 1- Eliminate or Increase fuel declaration caps: there will not be more  fuel declarations but price declarations (Section 1, Resolution 135). The  rules do not mention any cap for price declarations.  Goal 2 - Daily fuel declaration: The 6 month fuel declaration was replaced by  a daily price declaration (Section 1, Resolution 135).  Goal 3 - Reduce or eliminate the obligation to physically back up agreements  with end users or LDCs: According to the interpretation of AGEERA (Gencos  Association) we would have been gotten also this objective and marketers may  already buy or sell spot as long as the contract with the customer does not  have supply guarantee (Section 5, Resolution 135). It is not clear in the  rule wich is the condition for marketers to buy or sell spot.  Now the Secretariat of Energy must issue its own Resolution to amend the  technical Procedures in line with these rules. From the text of Resolution  135 (sections 3 c, 5 and considerations) there would be a good probability to  reach other two goals through the Secretariat of Energy rule: Reduce minimum term for Output & Demand Marketing Agreements to one month Eliminate or reduce to 1 MW the threshold for Output Marketing Agreements  Amr and I are asisting Buenos Aires Ofice to analize the new rules to  eventually submit comments to the Secretariat of Energy.

On June 26 the Minister of Infrastructure issued  Resolution 135/01 setting forth  the guidelines for the future regulation of  the Decree.   The Secretariat of Energy's resolution that will regulate the Decree will be  effective as from September 1, 2001. All agents of the electric sector will  be invited to comment the terms of regulatory decree, although such comments  will be used for informational purposes and will not bind the Secretariat of  Energy to make any changes whatsoever to its original document.    Although Decree No 804/01 is effective as from today, there are doubts in the  industry as to whether it will be abolished in the future by Congress.  The  reason for this uncertainty is that such Decree was issued within the  framework of the Competitivity Law, by which Congress delegated to the  Executive Branch its  powers to legislate  specifically on changes required  to transform the economy.  Although this Decree and the changes it fosters  indirectly affect the economy, since the law it amends is not purely  ""economical"", it may be questioned.  There is no term within which Congress  may exercise this right.   Please find a summary of the relevant changes below.  Generators Remuneration: Forward Market: freely negotiated Spot Market:  only payment of ""hourly spot price"" at each node. Hourly Spot Price: determined by price offers based on demand and  transportation constraints   Daily Declarations The day before the daily dispatch, each Generator shall:  declare its price offers for each  peak, shoulder and valley hour at its  node;  declare its maximum operating limits and minimum available capacity;   offer all of its available capacity.  Calculation of Hourly Spot Price ""HSP"" HSP shall be calculated by the OED according to procedure to be determined by  the Secretariat of Energy, not based on marginal costs as it is today. Prices shall be calculated at each node before the initiation of each day. At the end of each day prices shall be recalculated based off real operations  on the system.  Spot Market Generators and Marketers shall be paid on an hourly basis according to the  volume of energy delivered at the node, which shall be valued at the HSP. If distributors, large users and/or marketers enter into supply contracts  then to clear transactions on the spot market , the OED shall consider that  the sellers (Marketers/Generators) assume their clients payment obligations  before the market. On spot market transactions, Generators shall not receive payments for any  other concept.  Forward Market Generators and Marketers may enter into contracts with distributors,  marketers and large users at freely negotiated prices and terms.  Marketers Are now considered agents of the electric sector. May enter into forward contracts and/or carry our purchase and sale  transactions on the spot market at the node HSP. Must declare their offer and demand at each node of the system. Their obligations shall be similar to those of Generators and Distributors  when they transact at the MEM.  Congestion Rights   Right to receive profits resulting from the difference in energy prices  between two nodes related to the link and the capacity charge of the relevant  transmission system. In the case of:  Existing transportation lines under concession, these rights belong to the  State, which will sell them under a public offering called by the   Secretariat of Energy. Existing transportation lines carried out by an independent transporter shall  belong to such transporter. New transportation lines, shall belong to the owner of the same.  Expansions Sole Risk Investment Expansions: Open to anyone who is interested; will  require technical and environmental certification of the ENRE and license  from the                 Secretariat of  Energy.  System Reliability Expansions:  Shall be built by awardee of public tender.  Distributors Have to satisfy all demand of users within their area that have the choice of  independently contracting their supply in the  MEM; Distributors may offer  contracting options with or without supply guaranty; these contracts shall be  considered special contracts When they contract their demand with Generators and/or Marketers, the general  terms of the contracts as well as the procedure for selecting suppliers will  be subject to guidelines established by the Secretariat of Energy; In order for the price under these contracts to be passed through to their  end users tariffs, the relation between the term of the contracts and the  volume purchased must comply with a chart that basically states that the  greater the term of the contract, the lesser the percentage of contracted  energy. In any case, the total amount of energy contracted can not be in excess of  the total demand of users that can't transact on the MEM.  Forced Dispatch Distributors may request forced dispatch of certain units; The Distributor that requests forced dispatch is responsible for payment of  the same, Secretariat of Energy to control if forced dispatch costs are  reasonable. Such price shall not be transferred to end users and shall not be taken into  account to calculate the HSP.       ---------------------- Forwarded by Richard Shapiro/NA/Enron on 07/10/2001  04:48 PM ---------------------------   Jose Bestard@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT 07/07/2001 06:57 PM To: Luiz Maurer/SA/Enron@Enron cc: Richard Shapiro@Enron   Subject: Cuiaba Issues - July 6 situation-  Luiz.

It was signed early  afternoon and sent to Eletrobras.  The Eletrobras Diretoria had not followed this issue closely and need legal  clearance. Furnas and the Ministry (Perazzo) called to give it priority. Late  at night we received word that the ""parecer"" (opinion) was ready and that it  the Anex would  signed by Eletrobras next Monday and entered into their Board  meeting next Tuesday.  Petrobras sent us the letter we asked but took out of their version a key  word ""only"". ""Only"" refers that they will not go after us for non-payment if  Furnas does not pay. In the letter they also stated that they will commence  the loading operation -- at their own risk - Saturday. This was requested by  Perazzo to save logistical time because it takes three days to get to Cuiaba  from the refinery.   [Advised Laine of the situation to check Monday how many trucks were loaded  and  in transit]  We contacted Perazzo through Sergio Assad to get his word that there would  not be a last minute hitch; otherwise, we may have to refuse to take the  diesel and would create a BIG PR problem for all.  Topic III - Consent Package (Opinions, Aditivo, Consent) Furnas came in with the list of issues they wanted to discuss. I instead  insisted that we treat this meeting as a continuation of the MME meeting and  follow the Agenda  by looking at the Consent document package -- actually go  over the text -  that they find objectionable, and,  if it the text had a  direct link with any of their issues, we would discuss and examine the  relative positions.   What they told me is what they have told me before, that some of the issues  have nothing to do with the Consent but they want it as a condition to agree  to the package. Which is fine to me, because it will make it clear to the  government what we have been saying --- they want to change the deal. In  Furnas' defense, I need to add that they feel they have been handed a bad  contract  and they want regulatory relief, which it has been granted, on a  case-by-case basis, in other deals. So part of their strategy is to force  MME, or Aneel to provide some tariff relief.  I asked them to list out  the key issues with the Consent-  Old-- a) the 90  days additional time (Furnas), b) The guarantee substitution at the time of  privatization, c) the lenders involvement on contract changes ""we do not want  to go to Washington to negotiate"" - Newer - d) giving up their right to ask  Aneel to ""homologar"", ratify; rather than ""registrar"" contract changes [big  risk for us] . I believe the have more direct issues.   We go back to Rio Monday (another holiday down the drain) ..and Tuesday to  complete the list -- Topic II -- Regulatory conflicts  Jose             ",steven.kean@enron.com,richard.shapiro@enron.com,Regulatory Affairs events,2001-07-10 09:48:00-07:00,sent

Assemblyman Bill Leonard's most recent e-newsletter contained the following information.  I think it is very interesting to consider in light of the present energy situation in California and the comments of our present Governor.  Regards, Curt  ---------------------------------------------   ***Who Really Powers California?*** Governor Davis has made no secret that he believes that swashbuckling, cattle rustling, energy barons from Texas are to blame for our energy crisis.  While Texas power companies make for good bad guys in the Governor's transparent Kabuki theater of blame, Leonard Letter readers may be interested to see who really provides power to Californians.  The following list illustrates what percentage of our power supply each group of generators provides. (Editor's note: these percentages have been rounded up resulting in slightly more than 100%)  18%- Pacific Gas and Electric (California) 15%- Southern California Edison (California) 11%- Imported power from the Northwest (including Canada) 10%- Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (California) 10%- Imported power from the Southwest 7%- State and Federal Agencies 6%- AES power company 5%- Municipal Utilities and Irrigation Districts 5%- Reliant power company 4%- Duke power company 4%- Southern power company 4%- Dynegy power company 1%- Sacramento Municipal Utility District (California) 1%- Calpine power company 1%- San Diego Gas and Electric (California)   It should be noted that of this list, only Dynegy and Reliant are from Texas.  These two companies represent a total of 9% of California's energy portfolio.  By comparison, Georgia-based Southern (Mirant), Virginia's AES, and North Carolina's Duke Energy, have a 14% share of our energy portfolio.  This list does not focus on who is gaming the market.  However, every provider listed benefited from skyrocketing energy prices.  In trying to identify those power producers who used market power to ring up high profits on Californians, we should include ALL power producers in our investigations.  State and federal agencies, independent power companies, utilities, municipal utilities, and even local irrigation districts could all be guilty of gouging consumers.  Davis's focusing on only those companies from Texas does everyone in this state a disservice and is a misrepresentation of fact.  ------------------------------  Curt Pringle Curt Pringle & Assoc. 2532 Dupont Drive Irvine, CA 92612  (949) 474-4090 (949) 474-4082 fax  ","steven.kean@enron.com, james.steffes@enron.com, jeff.dasovich@enron.com,   susan.mara@enron.com",richard.shapiro@enron.com,FW: where does our energy come from?,2001-07-10 10:52:00-07:00,sent
"Rick  Tks for the interest. Here it goes.  As I said, this is an interesting and important case study to follow. I  personally do not believe that the association of distributors is going to  strongly stand against this decline in Initial Contracts. Afterall, there are  a monopsony for this ""cheap"" energy, totally creating a non level playing  field after 2003.  Please keep in mind that 2003 is one of our hopes to have  a decent business in Brazil.

Luiz Maurer 07/10/2001 10:47 AM To: Richard Shapiro/NA/Enron@Enron cc:    Subject: Good news - Re: Carta ELETROBOLT  Rick  Some good news. Kish is getting more involved. Orlando more confident to  express our (Enron's views). Those letters are just the tip of the iceberg, though.  Another  good subject for us to follow up closely is the Bill of Law 2905. It  proposes several changes to the electric sector. Inter alia, there is a  proposal to keep bulk energy prices regulated after 2003, when the initial  contracts start expiring. This is detrimental to Enron as it t will delay the  implementation of a real wholesale market. Keeping most of the energy  regulated will certainly have spillover effects on the unregulated business.  We have already discussed this subject internally. We all agree that this  proposal is bad for Enron. However, it may be good for Abradee, as the  distribution companies will be the only buyers of the cheap, regulated energy  after 2003. Needless to say, they will likely support it.  Some of our collegues are anxious and screaming that Enron should put a stick  on the ground. Right before I left, I prepared a simple ""white paper"" to us  to use internally and externally. It shows that maintaining energy regulated  is bad for competition and for expansion. Enron has been silent on this  issue.  If necessary, I can get this translated, It is really important. My  concern is that Enron will try to look for consensus and we will not be as  assertive as we should.    You may want to probe this issue with our top managers in South America,  at  some points in the future.

We shold say  something like we believe in the ""A"" market and applaud the governments  efforts to date, but we remain frustrated by what we view as unnecessary  restrictions on purchase and sale of certificates.  We shold then list the  changes we would make.  Then we should go on to state that we are puzzled as to the difference  between energy represented by certificates and energy produced by  Eletrobolt.  After all, an electron is an electron.  Why not collapse the  markets together?  Certifcates can settle at the MAE and merchant plants can  sell industrials the power they need above their meta on bilateral basis.  Starting with Eletrobolt, adding ""A"" market, and poining out how similar they  truly are produces what I think is a great flow and a great argument.

If the economic and political environment gets calmer, these rules will be an important step in the power deregulation process an will allow us to reach some of the goals set for the regulatory group for this year.  Goal 1- Eliminate or Increase fuel declaration caps: there will not be more fuel declarations but price declarations (Section 1, Resolution 135). The rules do not mention any cap for price declarations.  Goal 2 - Daily fuel declaration: The 6 month fuel declaration was replaced by a daily price declaration (Section 1, Resolution 135).  Goal 3 - Reduce or eliminate the obligation to physically back up agreements with end users or LDCs: According to the interpretation of AGEERA (Gencos Association) we would have been gotten also this objective and marketers may already buy or sell spot as long as the contract with the customer does not have supply guarantee (Section 5, Resolution 135). It is not clear in the rule wich is the condition for marketers to buy or sell spot.  Now the Secretariat of Energy must issue its own Resolution to amend the technical Procedures in line with these rules. From the text of Resolution 135 (sections 3 c, 5 and considerations) there would be a good probability to reach other two goals through the Secretariat of Energy rule: Reduce minimum term for Output & Demand Marketing Agreements to one month Eliminate or reduce to 1 MW the threshold for Output Marketing Agreements  Amr and I are asisting Buenos Aires Ofice to analize the new rules to eventually submit comments to the Secretariat of Energy. Attached is the document with the regulatory goals.

On June 26 the Minister of Infrastructure issued Resolution 135/01 setting forth  the guidelines for the future regulation of the Decree.   The Secretariat of Energy's resolution that will regulate the Decree will be effective as from September 1, 2001. All agents of the electric sector will be invited to comment the terms of regulatory decree, although such comments will be used for informational purposes and will not bind the Secretariat of Energy to make any changes whatsoever to its original document.    Although Decree N? 804/01 is effective as from today, there are doubts in the industry as to whether it will be abolished in the future by Congress.  The reason for this uncertainty is that such Decree was issued within the framework of the Competitivity Law, by which Congress delegated to the Executive Branch its  powers to legislate  specifically on changes required to transform the economy.  Although this Decree and the changes it fosters indirectly affect the economy, since the law it amends is not purely ""economical"", it may be questioned.  There is no term within which Congress may exercise this right.   Please find a summary of the relevant changes below.  Generators Remuneration: Forward Market: freely negotiated Spot Market:  only payment of ""hourly spot price"" at each node. Hourly Spot Price: determined by price offers based on demand and transportation constraints   Daily Declarations The day before the daily dispatch, each Generator shall:  declare its price offers for each  peak, shoulder and valley hour at its node;  declare its maximum operating limits and minimum available capacity;   offer all of its available capacity.  Calculation of Hourly Spot Price ""HSP"" HSP shall be calculated by the OED according to procedure to be determined by the Secretariat of Energy, not based on marginal costs as it is today. Prices shall be calculated at each node before the initiation of each day. At the end of each day prices shall be recalculated based off real operations on the system.  Spot Market Generators and Marketers shall be paid on an hourly basis according to the volume of energy delivered at the node, which shall be valued at the HSP. If distributors, large users and/or marketers enter into supply contracts then to clear transactions on the spot market , the OED shall consider that the sellers (Marketers/Generators) assume their clients payment obligations before the market. On spot market transactions, Generators shall not receive payments for any other concept.  Forward Market Generators and Marketers may enter into contracts with distributors, marketers and large users at freely negotiated prices and terms.  Marketers Are now considered agents of the electric sector. May enter into forward contracts and/or carry our purchase and sale transactions on the spot market at the node HSP. Must declare their offer and demand at each node of the system. Their obligations shall be similar to those of Generators and Distributors when they transact at the MEM.  Congestion Rights   Right to receive profits resulting from the difference in energy prices between two nodes related to the link and the capacity charge of the relevant transmission system. In the case of:  Existing transportation lines under concession, these rights belong to the State, which will sell them under a public offering called by the  Secretariat of Energy. Existing transportation lines carried out by an independent transporter shall belong to such transporter. New transportation lines, shall belong to the owner of the same.  Expansions Sole Risk Investment Expansions: Open to anyone who is interested; will require technical and environmental certification of the ENRE and license from the                 Secretariat of  Energy.  System Reliability Expansions:  Shall be built by awardee of public tender.  Distributors Have to satisfy all demand of users within their area that have the choice of independently contracting their supply in the  MEM; Distributors may offer contracting options with or without supply guaranty; these contracts shall be considered special contracts When they contract their demand with Generators and/or Marketers, the general terms of the contracts as well as the procedure for selecting suppliers will be subject to guidelines established by the Secretariat of Energy; In order for the price under these contracts to be passed through to their end users tariffs, the relation between the term of the contracts and the volume purchased must comply with a chart that basically states that the greater the term of the contract, the lesser the percentage of contracted energy. In any case, the total amount of energy contracted can not be in excess of the total demand of users that can't transact on the MEM.  Forced Dispatch Distributors may request forced dispatch of certain units; The Distributor that requests forced dispatch is responsible for payment of the same, Secretariat of Energy to control if forced dispatch costs are reasonable. Such price shall not be transferred to end users and shall not be taken into account to calculate the HSP.       ---------------------- Forwarded by Richard Shapiro/NA/Enron on 07/10/2001 04:48 PM ---------------------------   Jose Bestard@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT 07/07/2001 06:57 PM To: Luiz Maurer/SA/Enron@Enron cc: Richard Shapiro@Enron   Subject: Cuiaba Issues - July 6 situation-  Luiz.

It was signed early afternoon and sent to Eletrobras.  The Eletrobras Diretoria had not followed this issue closely and need legal clearance. Furnas and the Ministry (Perazzo) called to give it priority. Late at night we received word that the ""parecer"" (opinion) was ready and that it the Anex would  signed by Eletrobras next Monday and entered into their Board meeting next Tuesday.  Petrobras sent us the letter we asked but took out of their version a key word ""only"". ""Only"" refers that they will not go after us for non-payment if Furnas does not pay. In the letter they also stated that they will commence the loading operation -- at their own risk - Saturday. This was requested by Perazzo to save logistical time because it takes three days to get to Cuiaba from the refinery.   [Advised Laine of the situation to check Monday how many trucks were loaded and  in transit]  We contacted Perazzo through Sergio Assad to get his word that there would not be a last minute hitch; otherwise, we may have to refuse to take the diesel and would create a BIG PR problem for all.  Topic III - Consent Package (Opinions, Aditivo, Consent) Furnas came in with the list of issues they wanted to discuss. I instead insisted that we treat this meeting as a continuation of the MME meeting and follow the Agenda  by looking at the Consent document package -- actually go over the text -  that they find objectionable, and,  if it the text had a direct link with any of their issues, we would discuss and examine the relative positions.   What they told me is what they have told me before, that some of the issues have nothing to do with the Consent but they want it as a condition to agree to the package. Which is fine to me, because it will make it clear to the government what we have been saying --- they want to change the deal. In Furnas' defense, I need to add that they feel they have been handed a bad contract  and they want regulatory relief, which it has been granted, on a case-by-case basis, in other deals. So part of their strategy is to force MME, or Aneel to provide some tariff relief.  I asked them to list out  the key issues with the Consent-  Old-- a) the 90 days additional time (Furnas), b) The guarantee substitution at the time of privatization, c) the lenders involvement on contract changes ""we do not want to go to Washington to negotiate"" - Newer - d) giving up their right to ask Aneel to ""homologar"", ratify; rather than ""registrar"" contract changes [big risk for us] . I believe the have more direct issues.   We go back to Rio Monday (another holiday down the drain) ..and Tuesday to complete the list -- Topic II -- Regulatory conflicts  Jose             ",steven.kean@enron.com,richard.shapiro@enron.com,Regulatory Affairs events,2001-07-10 19:48:00-07:00,sent

"I assume the issue is TGS (instead of CGS) I will call you after sending this mail. Below is a small analysis related to the convertibility Law and TGS.=20   1. Argentina Convertibility Law No 23,928.  The Convertibility Law passed on March 1991 determined the following: ? Established a fixed exchange rate between the dollar and the national=20 currency (1 dollar =3D 10,000 Australes, latter defined as equal to 1 peso) ? The Central Bank (Argentine Federal Reserve) must permanently have=20 international reserves (dollars, gold, other currencies) available to back= =20 100% of the monetary base. The Central Bank must sell all required dollars = at=20 the fixed exchange rate. ? It is forbidden any price adjustment clause by an index. ? For all transactions agreed upon before the Law, prices could not be larg= er=20 than the contractual price, adjusted by the exchange rate variation plus 12= %=20 a year (section 9). This section affected contracts in force. ? The Convertibility Law was just amended on June 22nd 2001 by the Law 2544= 5,=20 to equal 1 peso to the simple average of 1 dollar and 1 euro. Anyway,=20 according to its section 2, the new Convertibility rule will only be in for= ce=20 once the price market of 1 dollar is equal to 1 euro (to avoid a surprise= =20 devaluation).  2. Legal requirements for a devaluation  To modify the exchange rate before 1 dollar =3D 1 euro, it would be necessa= ry=20 to abolish or amend again the Convertibility Law. In such regards, the Congress would have to abolish the Convertibility Law = or=20 keep the Convertibility at a different exchange rate.=20 Although in principle a devaluation should not affect contracts with prices= =20 set in dollars, even the Convertibility Law has affected contracts that wer= e=20 in force. So, there is a certain risk that a new eventual amendment of the=20 Convertibility Law could affect contracts in force. In fact I think there is a higher risk of the government breaching the=20 contracts or defaulting debt payments than devaluating the currency by=20 surprise.  3. Impact on TGS Since the privatization rules establish that TGS=01, rates are in dollars, = a=20 devaluation that respects contracts in force should not have a significant= =20 impact on TGS financial results.

"Rick:  I guess you will have been reasonably pleased with the Commissions July 12th Orders on the RTOs. It seems to be going down the same basic road we have been discussing.  I guess there will now be a relatively short process to outline each of the proposed mega-RTOs. While the Northeast RTO is most pinned down, the others seem well up in the air. The Southeast RTO in particular seems to be flailing a bit.  If you or any of your folks were keen I am very interested in the SE RTO and Western RTO in particular. As they move beyond the usual groups of utility guys sitting around a table it might be a good time to throw some economic reality into the picture. Could be method for presenting some of the thinking of the policy paper to the world?  Hope you had a good trip to London.

"Rick, as I mentioned to you last week, I would like you to help to organise  the visit of two italian officials this summer. The first one is  - Mauro Formaggio (Director of Gas at the Italian Gas and Power Regulatory  Authority)  I have a very good relationship with him and we have helped him in the past  re. UK Gas Grid Code and other issues regarding gas TPA. He is now working on  the TPA rules applicable to the Italian gas market, and he is asking if he  could meet someone in Enron to understand more about the general operation of  a big pipeline (despatching operation, commercial scheduling of transmission,  nomination, balancing and allocation, as well as to the infomation that the  pipeline gives to the general public and to regulatory authorities). Please,  see this e-mail below. He has not yet decided the dates, but he is aiming at  last week of August, for 1/2 days.   I would suggest you could put me in touch with someone in our organisation  who could help on this, and I would co-ordinate Formaggio's meeting.   Alfredo, I'm scheduling a visit to the USA on the practice of TPA. in the month of August. The aspects I'm considering are: - how OBAs are organized and how they are applied, - the operation of hubs, - the balancing penalties, - the trading of capacity - the general operation of a (big) pipeline - the general operation of a state pipeline, and of a LDC - the operation of a shipper Please let me know whether you deem it feasible also a meeting with your american colleagues on any of these items. --- In the meantime I have arranged for a visit to a major shipper and trader, in  Atlanta (on the access as it is seen and done by a shipper, on many pipelines  and storages), and to another major shipper and producer in Houston (on the  relationship with FERC and other regulatory authorities, as well as on the  access practice). A visit to a major pipeline would fit well in this framework. To my opinion,  Northern would be all right. It should act as a model to what could also be  arranged, with time, by big transmission operator(s) in our country. It could  refer to the dispatching operation, and to the commercial scheduling of  transmission, to the nomination, balancing and allocation, as well as to the  infomation that the pipeline gives to the general public and to regulatory  authorities. If possible, two days would be a proper duration. I think you can consider me a relatively well informed person, so there would  be no need of formal presentations. The opportunity to see real operations  and to discuss with experts would be all right.  In the past, when I was in Snam, I took the opportunity of keeping in touch  with the developments in the Usa. So, I already have a relatively good  general knowledge of the american system. Last time was some years ago, when  I visited Transcanada, in Calgary, for a week (focusing on nomination and  balancing). Among the pipelines I visited in the course of earlier years,  there were EL Paso, PG&E, Northwestern and also Northern for a short visit. Going to Omaha would not be a problem for me. As for the period, it would be in the second half of August (because with  september there would be a very heavy workload to do, here in Milano). Thank you and best regards Mauro   Dear Alfredo, I'm finalizig this week the program for a visit in the USA for and updte on TPA practice, there. Among of meetings I'm going to arrange, it would be of interest a visit at a major pipeline. Northern seems to me a good example. Would you envisage it as a possible example for me? I would discuss the organization of dispatching, see the nomination and balancing operation, the allocation of measurement, and other major aspects of TPA implementation (including OBAs with interconnecting pipelines) for transmission and storage. I'm considering the end of August for such a visit. Owing to the extent of the subjects, maybe two days would be appropriate.

"After our discussion at lunch last Thursday, I think I need more advice from  you on how to deal with the sort of intervention you can see below!! I tried  really hard to cover all the bases on this initiative, nearly all face to  face. Then Paul H didn't turn up at the staff meeting on Monday and I get the  e-mailed questions you see below (when he could have come to chat to me about  it.) I will of course try to smooth over things verbally with Paul, but if  this is what happens when I ""give up"" 30% of the time of a direct report to  benefit her career development and the company's biz. priorities, you will  understand some frustration on my part at our current arrangements!!   ---------------------- Forwarded by Peter Styles/LON/ECT on 17/07/2001 20:37  ---------------------------   Peter Styles 17/07/2001 20:19 To: Paul Hennemeyer/Enron@EUEnronXGate @ ENRON cc: Doug Wood/Enron@EUEnronXGate@ENRON, Paul Dawson/Enron@EUEnronXGate@ENRON   Subject: Nailia's opportunity to work more on the trading floor    I have made no formal request to HR for housing, Paul. As you know, I have  agreed with Eric Shaw, Paul Mead, Paul Dawson and Alfredo Huertas that Nailia  will spend c. 30% of her time in the next six months working on Italian reg.  issues, and that to facilitate that role and to help her get better exposure  to commercial teams on EU issues too, she will spend on average three days a  week over that period on the trading floor, next to the Italian team. (We  announced all of this in the staff meeting yesterday.)    Her travel to London tends to be weekly already, and is done on a very  reasonable Eurostar youth fare basis. I think the budget question then is  simply: Is it more efficient for the company to pay for a hotel room two,  three or four nights a week or to allow Nailia to take a cheap flat share?  The latter may well work out better, especially taking into account the  flexibility it will allow. I am told Tara Rozen has a suggestion. Let's see  the comparison; then I agree the four of us should judge together. I'll keep  you informed. Give me a call if you have any other concerns about any aspect  of the arrangements.  Peter.

If the Legislature does get the budget done and recesses without addressing  the energy issues, then decision-making on some key issues---Direct Access in  particular---will fall back in the PUC's lap. (The Legislature is scheduled  to be out until August 20th.) The PUC has scheduled a vote on whether to suspend DA, the rate agreement  with DWR, DWR's rev. req. and other issues on August 23rd. PUC President Loretta Lynch has said that she wants to issue a proposed  decision on these issues sometime between now and the first week of August. As Jim points out, we continue to try to hammer out favorable outcomes for  Direct Access and cost allocation in both forums----the Legislature and the  PUC.

Looks like  the only thing that is going to happen will be a Budget without anything on  energy restructuring (could continue to change).  There will be some additional negotiating on SBX2 78 over the recess.  Enron  is looking for a way into those discussions (Jeff Dasovich).  We will try to  push good language on DA dates and assignment of Utility and CDWR costs.  On another note, CDWR has announced its revenue requirements going forward.  The numbers are significantly less than had previously been expected (due to  lower costs for spot market purchases).  The end result, if their figures are  correct, is that the March 27 3c/kwh increase would be sufficient going  forward (we are trying to validate).  The key is that now the Retained  Generation proceedings will determine if any more $ is needed from retail  customers.

This largely represents TURN's proposal.  The Senate also passed a budget and has since adjourned until August 20.  The Assembly had been considering two MOUs, ABX 82 (Keeley) and ABX 50 (Wright).  Both bills had difficulty attracting a majority of votes given their different approaches to dealing with SCE.  ABX 82 for example, had large users picking up most of the tab for SCE's undercollection whereas ABX 50 split those charges among all users.  Both bills provided for some type of direct access and ABX 82 also provided for a purchase of the transmission system.  In light of the difficulty in passing either bill, it appears as if the Assembly will shelve both proposals today in order to amend SBX 78 over the summer break.  An internal legislative working group may be formed to draft amendments but this has not been confirmed.  Large users have begun drafting extensive amendments recognizing that in its current form SBX 78 has very little to offer.  The Assembly will try to pass the final portion of the budget today and recess until August 20.

" Rick  In general, I think there is significant and increaing demand for regulatory services, particularly on the Continent. The attached list should give you some idea of my current and planned activities. Markets remain under-developed and there are still  signficant battles to be fought to establlish the appropriate framework for our business.   A few thoughts for your pending budget discussions  1. I believe we have already given back a considerable sum. (in excess of $ 2 mn) 2. We have been husbanding some resources to fight big continental battles and now have the green light to  move ahead on some on these. 3. We remain at about 2/3rds of the level in terms of head count that we had planned to be at this time, and this despite rising demand from our clients.  4. We have lost and only partially  replaced several regulatory staff over the past year (Tom Briggs, Philip Davies, Kyran Hanks, Stephen Jones, Chris Day, Fiona Grant) 5. I believe any further cuts would start to have real effect on our ability to deliver. 6. If Michael insists then we must also agree on clear reduction of our regulatory effort and have buy-in from Eric and Richard on this. 7. Letting PAs go is a false economy and should not be done.

This is THE story out here today.  Given the repugnant things that  Maviglio has said about Enron over the past several months, it will be very  interesting to see whether he'll be able to withstand the fact that all the  time that he was saying those things, he owned our stock.  Gee, couldn't  happen to a nicer guy.  Best, Jeff  In addition, all this buzz about conflicts with traders and Calpine could put  in jeopardy the state's contracts with Calpine, which may, in the end, be a  very good thing for Direct Access. Davis spokesman under fire for stock  By Amy Chance and Dale Kasler Bee Staff Writers (Published July 31, 2001)  Davis administration spokesman Steve Maviglio acknowledged Monday that he  bought stock in Calpine Corp. in June, at a time when the company was  announcing a breakthrough in its bid to build a controversial San Jose power  plant.  His disclosure came several days after Gov. Gray Davis dismissed five state  power purchasers for owning stock in the company and drew new complaints that  Davis administration officials may have improperly mixed their private  finances and their public roles.  Maviglio, now acting as interim communications director for the  administration, said he put in an ""open"" order for Calpine stock May 31,  agreeing to buy 300 shares once the stock hit a certain price.  He said that threshold was met June 20, the day after an action by the  Federal Energy Regulatory Commission brought down ""all energy stock prices  across the board.""  Maviglio said he bought the stock for his individual retirement account, and  it has since declined in value. Under terms of the open order, he said, he  had no control over the exact date of purchase.  Maviglio touted the company in his role as spokesman to the governor in a  story published June 27 in The Bee. He said Monday that he was simply  responding to a reporter's question about the company's positive reputation.  ""They have made a clear commitment to invest in California's future,""  Maviglio said at the time. ""Their pricing has been far more reasonable than  any other generator.""  In the interview, Maviglio also contrasted Calpine and Texas-based  generators. He said Calpine ""took a different tack from the Joe Bobs of the  world,"" an apparent reference to Joe Bob Perkins, a senior executive with  Reliant Energy Inc. of Houston.  Maviglio acknowledged the stock ownership several days after the  administration ended its relationship with several energy consultants who  held stock in energy companies, including Calpine.  Under pressure from Secretary of State Bill Jones, a Republican who hopes to  challenge Davis for governor next year, the Davis administration has spent  several weeks scrambling to answer questions about the stock holdings and  potential conflicts of its consultants and energy traders.  Jones said Monday that Maviglio should be fired.  ""These actions are unethical, unconscionable, unacceptable, and heads should  roll,"" he said in a statement. He said the Democratic governor should direct  all of his staff to immediately file updated conflict-of-interest statements  to reflect current holdings.  Jones, who last week asked the Securities and Exchange Commission to  investigate administration consultants for insider trading, also said the  probe should be expanded ""to include all of the governor's staff.""  Federal law and SEC regulations forbid anyone from trading stocks while  possessing ""insider information"" -- relevant facts not available to the  public, according to the SEC. Violations can bring lawsuits and criminal  prosecution.  Michael Prozan, a Menlo Park lawyer and expert on insider trading, said the  prohibition against it originally focused on halting company executives from  profiting from news before it was disclosed publicly.  But the laws have been broadened to include others besides company employees.  Investment bankers, lawyers and journalists have been snared by  insider-trading crackdowns.  Davis' office was instrumental earlier this year in paving the way for  removing barriers to construction of a Calpine plant in San Jose. On May 30,  after opposing the project for years, San Jose Mayor Ron Gonzales announced  he had negotiated an agreement addressing his concerns and agreed to support  construction.  His action came after Davis in April endorsed the plant's construction and as  the state Energy Commission threatened to approve it over local objections.  On June 20, the company announced it had won tentative state approval to  build the plant.  Maviglio said he buys many stocks and that Enron Corp. and Calpine are the  only energy generators among them. He owns 100 shares of Enron stock, which  he purchased in 1996.  ""I deal with hundreds of California companies just about every day, and this  was one that I saw that looked like a good investment based on public  knowledge,"" he said. ""I read six newspapers a day or more, and I know what's  going on in the world. If there's a standard that I can't invest in something  that I have general public knowledge of, then I wouldn't have any stocks at  all.""  Maviglio said that the ""open"" order he placed meant that he could not have  used inside information to make his stock purchase.  ""Had I had specific knowledge about a contract being signed or what actually  happened in the office of the mayor of San Jose ... that would have been  unrelated,"" Maviglio said. ""There was no timing-based sequence to it.""  Calpine stock, despite the company's considerable success, has slipped in  recent weeks because of general investor anxiety about the California energy  crisis.  The stock, which trades on the New York Stock Exchange, closed at $49.30 on  May 31, the day Maviglio says he placed the purchase order. The order was  executed as the stock dipped below $40 on June 20, closing that day at  $39.85.  The day before, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission announced a  price-control plan that investors believed was damaging to generators'  profits. On Monday, the stock closed at $37.13.  Last week, the Davis administration stopped doing business with five energy  traders under contract with the administration after Maviglio said  administration lawyers ""came to the determination that there are possible  violations of the law or close to it.""  ""It's not a crime to own energy stock,"" Maviglio said Monday. ""The difference  with these traders is they're making governmental decisions. They're  committing the state's resources by spending money to buy power.""  Jim Knox, director of California Common Cause, said he believes the  Governor's Office made critical errors while hiring staff to purchase energy  for the state.  ""Had the Governor's Office gone to the trouble to have these people fill  statements of economic interest, as they were required to do by law, they  should have known this before they were hired and they shouldn't have been  hired,"" Knox said.

I saw the briefing book upon his arrival for the visit and the Ambassador had heavily underlined it.  I also spoke with him about the issue at length during our drive down to Buffalo.  In other words, the Ambassador is thoroughly briefed on the matter.  I also took the opportunity at the evening reception following the Board of Trade breakfast on June 28 (your Garrett Tripp was at the breakfast) to speak with Pennsylvania Governor Tom Ridge about his providing moral support to Premier Harris on moving ahead with the market opening. Ridge spoke to the Board of Trade about his state's positive market opening experience.  Governor Ridge said he would make the point to Premier Harris at the earliest opportunity. Another interesting development was that the PAC's Commissioner during the successful Pennsylvania opening -- a Mr. Quain, is now in private consulting practice.  It would seem reasonable for the OEB to spend some money to hire Mr. Quain to review their progress so far and perhaps make some helpful suggestions.   Unfortunately, the Premier was not available for a meeting with the Ambassador (Walkerton testimony was a day away) during that June visit.

This is a useful analysis.  I sympathize with your comments re: quality, but I'm afraid you will see similar weaknesses in the work of other firms.  Your question about financially settled transactions is on point.  Can you draft a question that would close that loop? That way, we can avoid this problem going forward.    Your summary did leave me with a couple of questions:  1. Does the advice indicate which PRC agency will regulate futures trading?  2. Is the advice on liquid fuels adequate for physically settled transactions (aside from the dumping issue)?  If not, how can the initial memo be improved to prevent that in the future?  3. Are you comfortable that Enron could trade derivatives if the gambling question is resolved, or is it too vague to rely on at all?  4. Can you offer an opinion on the insolvency/netting advice?  5.

I am going to leave early and stay home tomorrow to recover (Doctor's orders).    I have reviewed the due diligence completed by the local counsel in China in 1997.  Below you will find a summary of the due diligence as well as my opinion of its reliability and its applicability to trading other physical commodities.    To reiterate a point made the the local counsel, the PRC government is taking strict control over financial futures, which includes transactions traded through a trading exchange.  Therefore, derivative transactions in this due diligence does not include financial futures.  China trade regime is very non-transparent.  There are still substantial trade barriers in place to consider.  Import barriers, and opaque and inconsistent legal system and limitations on market access combine to make it difficult for foreign firms to do business in China.     Summary  First of all, the due diligence composed by the local counsel is quite difficult to follow, even when guided by an index.  The organization of the due diligence needs work.  It also bothers me that the local counsel does not seem to commit to some of their answers (e.g., ""We do not think..."").  My feeling is that as Chinese nationals, these attorneys should be very familiar with their own laws and confident with their advice to foreigners.  Furthermore, the position that the local counsel takes on this due diligence comes from a strict legal standpoint.  They do not seem to take into consideration the side of the corporation (i.e. Enron).  The questions that keeps popping into my mind are: 1) whether or not the various laws and ordinances regulating the petroleum business in China apply if the transactions are financially settled only and 2) Will the Chinese Court conclude that a derivaties contract constitutes a gambling contract?  Also, the local counsel should have addressed the various laws for commodity products transactions.  The local counsel should have applied the Commodities Exchange Law, Financial Futures Transaction Law, Bank and Securities Laws, Foreign Exchange Foreign Trade Law, Law on Consignment and other Issues of Foreign Transactions in Foreign Commodity Markets and Insurance Business Law as well as any articles related to physical trading, licensing, banking, activies, facilities, market prohibitions, gambling and insurance regulations.   Finally, noticeable absent from the due diligence is any mention of anti-dumping measures.

"Rick:  As per our discussion this morning, please find attached the general description for Risk Analytics & Fundamentals Group.     I welcome any question and/or suggestion.    Best regards  AI 3-3037  Risk Analytics & Fundamentals Group  This Group has three largely inter-related functions.  They are:    1) Risk Analytics: The primary purpose of this new group is to provide workable, tested, and cost-effective processes to identify, quantify, mitigate, and/or manage regulatory risks embedded in Enron's businesses.  The immediate objectives of the group are:  i) Establish, test, and implement methodologies for identifying, quantifying, and mitigating/management of the regulatory Risks in URM in North America.   ii)  Establish, test, and implement methodologies for identifying, quantifying, and mitigating/management of the regulatory Risks in the relevant activities for EWS in North America.  Extend the system to Europe. iii) Provide, test and implement methodologies for identifying, quantifying, and mitigating/management of the regulatory risks in the three most important commodities in EGM, and EIM (Coal, Steel, and Forest Products).  Extend the system to Europe, if applicable.  Finally, the Group should periodically aggregate the risk findings in the different business units in a single report for communication and resource allocation purposes by GA Management.     2) Fundamentals:  The secondary purpose of the group is to initiate the Regulatory Fundamentals Section.  Its purpose is to provide analyzed regulatory information to commercial/regulatory data that should enhance the range of the products and services that GA is providing to the different commercial teams.  Examples of such regulatory/commercial data include interstate electricity sales and prices, availability of transmission capacity on different interties, demand and supply analysis on the appropriate customer level,?etc.    The Fundamentals section should also work as a powerhouse for GA Support Services (GASS) to provide in-depth analysis of regulatory problems/issues.  It should assist GASS in providing consulting services to the different commercial teams in issues related to risk measurements and mitigations.    The immediate objective of this activity is: i) Establish, test, and run systems for regulatory fundamentals in EWS (Gas and Electric).  3) International Regulatory Support: The third purpose of the group is to provide Regulatory Support to Enron's Assets, and commercial positions, in Venezuela, Argentina, Brazil, and India on ad-hoc basis to identify the operational regulatory risks.

As I'm sure Tim has told you, we have devoted a significant amount of time over the past few months on projects designed to promote Weather products:    State-by-state matrix:  Masha has put together a state-by-state summary of regulatory / utility activity with respect to hedging in general, and weather hedging specifically.  This matrix shows the mindset of the regulators and utilities for each of the states.   Are regulators encouraging hedging?  are they allowing passthrough of costs?  are they addressing weather in any fashion?  You'll find the answers to these questions - and more - in Masha's matrix.  This will hopefully help you to target and prioritize origination opportunities.  Risk Management White Paper:   Government Affairs has developed a ""white paper"" which talks about the benefits of hedging and risk management, which we will use in the states to advocate market-based solutions to price and weather risk management.    Georgia Power Case:   Harry Kingerski and I will be developing testimony in the Georgia Power case which will recommend that the Commission reject Georgia Power's performance-based weather proposal, and will advocate that the Commission require Georgia Power to utilize weather derivative products provided by Enron and others.   Our hope is that we will create a precedent for these types of products in other states as well.   We would like to meet with your group to walk through each of these projects, and to help identify origination opportunities with LDCs and electric utilities.

"Rick, as you are likely aware, Ontario market opening has once again been pushed back with March 2002 likely the earliest possible start. From a strategic standpoint, you will recall that we decided to align our interests with the outcome of the OEB/IMO readiness report due out in September. Our regulatory position was that it was highly likely that the outcome of this report would be positive and by supporting this initiative it would push the government to immediately open the market (likely November 2001). In the interim however, the OEB has unilaterally deferred market opening to 2002 with the deferral of stage 2 of the self-certification process from August to December.

"Did you see this?    confrontation at kids' school By MIRIAM A. GARCIA Copyright 2001 Houston Chronicle State Rep. Garnet Coleman, D-Houston, was arrested Monday and charged with misdemeanor assault after a confrontation with the president of his children's school. Coleman, 39, is accused of assaulting Harsh Kumar, 46, the president of the Montessori School of Downtown & Medical Center at 4510 Caroline, according to Houston Police Department spokeswoman Sylvia Trevino. Police arrested Coleman about 5:30 p.m. after an argument over the recent dismissal of Coleman's son's teacher, police said. Coleman said he and his wife went to the school to discuss the dismissals of three teachers. ""He told me to get out of his building and started disrespecting my wife,"" Coleman said. ""I've just never been treated so badly in my life. I overreacted and pushed him back into the couch, and he started yelling at me and I started yelling at him."" Coleman, who has been the state representative from District 147 since 1992, said he was tired after returning from a trip to Israel the day before and had been frustrated all day because the air conditioning in his office was out. ""I was wrong, but at the same time he disrespected my wife. And I was tired and had jet lag, and, quite honestly, my wife and kids are all I have,"" Coleman said. Kumar disputed Coleman's version, saying he was pushed twice and hit in the face four times during the argument. ""I didn't disrespect him,"" Kumar said. ""I was very shocked when he started yelling at me, and I had to run away from him."" Coleman said his wife had asked the administration to warn her of any teaching changes because they wanted their children to keep the teacher they'd had since starting at the school. His 9-year-old son has had the same teacher since he was 2, Coleman said, and his 6-year-old daughter has attended the school for three years. ""They go year-round and are there from 7:30 (a.m.) to 6 p.m., 52 weeks a year,"" Coleman said. ""These are the people we trust our kids with."" Kumar said the couple also expressed concern because the teachers are black, as is Coleman. ""We decided not to renew the contracts for two of them, and the other teacher decided to go on her own,"" Kumar said. ""Coincidentally, the two women that replaced them are black.""

"Rick, here are my comments:  There was never any alternative on the table but to align ourselves with the IMO/OEB Market Readiness Plan.  It was never going to be possible to open the market without sufficient technical readiness on the part of the central institutions in the market - the IMO and the distributors.  We could not reasonably expect the Government to open the market if the primary regulator - i.e. the OEB -  was saying that the distributors were not ready. Anyone who thinks otherwise is dreaming. We were instrumental in getting the OEB to adopt the  ""aggressive"" timetable that they did.  The distributors see us as being the main party pushing for tighter timelines etc. (And don't like us for it). There was little we could do (subject to what I  say several bullets below) to effect readiness other than pushing for the OEB to enforce timelines.  Contrary to what Rob says, at no time was it our position that it was highly likely that the OEB report would be positive. See the bottom of the first page of our briefing note for Lavorato and Lay (attached) where we express uncertainty regarding distributor readiness.  Certainly our public position on readiness was upbeat - precisely so we could press our other positions re pricing, Pickering, etc.  Those arguments would have been irrelevant if there was no prospect of sufficient technical readiness. Our whole objective since April has been to keep November 2001 alive as prospect - so long as there was sufficient technical readiness (a factor over which we had little control).   Just so you know,several months ago,  I raised the possibility of pushing for a split wholesale/retail opening and was told not to do so - because of the adverse commercial implications re the British Energy contract renegotiation. .  In any event, I think sticking with a single market opening is the correct approach - because it puts the stronger institution - the IMO - in the position of having a strong interest in pushing/pulling the weaker one - the OEB - along.  Just so you know, several months ago, I raised the possibility of Enron Canada investing more resources in developing or securing from otherssuppliers  CIS systems etc. that could be made available to the distributors to get them ready.  This was dismissed.  My expectation for several weeks (prior to the OEB report) was that the report would involve some delay (length uncertain) in retail market readiness.  Paul and others were advised.   My understanding is that the IMO and IMO Board of Directors were informed of the OEB report the day or two before it was issued.  Milnthorp made it clear to me that he was afraid of telling Lavorato and left it to me to do so (via the material for Harris). I our conversation, Milly blamed the Chair of the IMO Board for caving in.  He never expressed the views set forth in his memo to you.  Also, it is worth noting that the OEB report took the government - both the Ministry and the Premier's Office - by complete surprise. Having said all this, I have to say that Paul has been fully supportive and nothing herein should be read as a criticism of him.         -----Original Message----- From:  Shapiro, Richard   Sent: Tuesday, August 07, 2001 2:30 PM To: Dadson, Aleck Subject: FW: Ontario Market Opening      -----Original Message----- From:  Milnthorp, Rob   Sent: Tuesday, August 07, 2001 11:45 AM To: Shapiro, Richard Subject: Ontario Market Opening   Rick, as you are likely aware, Ontario market opening has once again been pushed back with March 2002 likely the earliest possible start.

"Hello! Rick,  Yesterday the Mexican Electric Congress successfully concluded. It was a very good event because we had the opportunity to know the ideas and thoughts from the different sectors that integrates the electric industry.   Some of the participants were: The Secretary and Undersecretary of Energy  The Programming Sub director of the Federal Electricity Commission or CFE The General Director of Central Light and Power Company or LFC Pemex Gas Petroqu?mica B?sica or PGPB The Chairman of the Energy Regulatory Commission The Energy Regulatory Commissioner of France General Electric (technology, Gas and steam turbines) ICA Fluor Daniel, and Iconsa (Construction companies) The Chairman of the Mexican Association of Electric Energy or AMEE ITAM (academic institution) The Head of the Investment Promotion Unit of the Secretariat of Energy Specialized Legal Bureaus Inter-American Development Bank Under secretary of Planning of the Secretariat of Energy Wartsila North America Inc. The General Director of Transalta The Chairman of Enron  Protego, Investment and financing bureau. The Associate Director of the Cambridge Energy Research Associates for LATAM The Chairman of the Mexican Association of Natural Gas The participation of the four main political parties of Mexico, PRI, PAN, PRD and the PVEM.   Here are some of the conclusions of the event:  - The structure of the electric industry has to be changed to ensure the supply for the upcoming years. In several presentations the participants mentioned that electricity demand has overcome the economic growth, due to this situation Mexico requires a strong expansion of the electric system, an expansion that needs a lot of investments and where the state companies do not generate sufficient resources to support this expansion and their maintenance.   - All agreed that rates are unreal and need to be restructured and also review the subsidies structure.  - Another concern is the availability of the natural gas because almost all the new plants are combined cycle plants that use natural gas and the problem is that Mexico has reserves but not the money to subtract it. Related to this issue Dr. Jaime Alatorre, mentioned that the Congress needs to give open access to the private investment to both markets the natural gas and the electric market.  - A fundamental reform of the legal system. - The creation of a competitive electricity market with effective and transparent regulation to incite investment and the determination of prices under the responsibility of the market operator. - The IPP structure will not satisfy the electricity demand for the next years, Mexico needs other structures to meet demand. - Current assets will not be privatized.  The final part of the event was very interesting due to the debate between the political parties representatives, because they have different ideas on how to solve the situation and the problem will be to get a resolution between those ideas at the Congress. PRI - they don?t want to change the structure, because they think Mexico has a good electrical performance and does not have to follow the privatization model or worldwide trends, because privatization does not guarantee the solution of the Mexican electricity problems. PRD - they recognize that the electric sector has problems that need to be solve giving the state companies the sufficient autonomy. They do not want to modify the legal system. PVEM - they are open to change the structure of the energy industry.  PAN - they are open to change the structure of the energy industry.   Enron, besides the presentation of Dr. Jaime Alatorre, was named in various presentations in relation with the Vitro project in Monterrey. I think it was a good opportunity for us to participate in this kind of events, where we can share our ideas and show the interest of Enron to solve the challenge of the reorganization of the Mexican electric system.

"Rick:  Please find attached the first cut of the suggested structure.  Honestly, this was a surprisingly difficult task.   The first cut, page one, is close to what is currently on the ground making the regions reporting to the head of the ""Electricity & Gas"".  The regions shall be divided-temporarily-into ""wholesale"" and ""retail"" by ISO regions.  This is because the skill set between ""wholesale"", and ""retail"" are different, and some time is required for them to converge (perhaps, 6 to 9 months) into one group.        However, this suggestion does not address two concerns, namely,: 1. How to bring Federal Government Affairs to focus on Electricity & Gas needs (mainly FERC). 2. How to address the regional needs of Global Markets and EBS.  The second suggestion, addresses the first point by dividing Federal Government Affairs into two sections.  One section-mainly political relationship management-remains as suggested in slide one, taking FERC Government Affairs and put it under ""Energy Business"".  This avoids ""dotting reporting lines"" phenomenon which-in my opinion- is less effective.     Of course, Energy Business can bring the suggested components into one block of skill pool very similar to a consultancy model.  In which case, the entire group, as in slide three, will be inside one box, possibly making the implementation easier among the whole group.  The components of the box (i.e., the skill set required), however, will be the same as in slide 2.  The consulting structure can also address the regional needs of Global Markets and EBS, which are not envisaged to be substantial.

The purpose of naming a team leader woul= d be to provide more consistent leadership for the group on a day-to-day ba= sis, principally on personnel issues, but also to ensure that a consistent = policy approach is being taken across the Government Affairs group on issue= s that affect the company.  I know that John is ambivalent about naming suc= h a team leader, but I thought that I would make the case once again, and, = hopefully in a more compelling manner so we can move forward with this idea= .  First, it is important to say what the designation of a team leader would n= ot do.  It would not, in my estimation, change the nature of the reporting = relationships that we currently have relative to Eric Shaw, Richard Lewis a= nd myself.  Peter Styles and Paul Hennemeyer will continue to report to Eri= c Shaw and myself, and Paul Dawson and Doug Wood would continue to report t= o Richard Lewis and myself.   Second, as the unchanged nature of the report= ing relationships indicate, this change is in no way intended to diminish t= he role of Eric and/or Richard relative to the management of the Government=  Affairs group, but merely to ensure that someone is tending to personnel, = administrative and group management issues on a daily basis.  Third, by nam= ing a team leader within the Government Affairs group, I am not attempting,=  in any way, to step back from the role that I personally have taken on rel= ative to the group - I will continue to provide strategic guidance (where I=  can) and also will continue to ensure that the Enron Europe Government Aff= airs group is fully integrated within the global government affairs functio= n so that the Europe group is the beneficiary of knowledge and information = that is developed around the world within the government affairs function.  The intent of designating a team leader, as already stated, is merely to en= sure that issues related to the administration of the group, consistency of=  external advocacy, and personnel issues are handled on a timely and effect= ive basis.  While I believe there have been many benefits from the current = organizational structure, one of the significant and increasingly more noti= ceable negatives has been that there has not always been a consistent and f= air approach to the handling of personnel issues within the group (notwiths= tanding my best efforts to deal with these issues from a distance).  This h= as resulted in, what I consider to be, the sub-optimal handling of at least=  one employee who is in the process of being terminated, as well as inconsi= stent messaging to many of the junior people within the group in terms of w= hat their career opportunities are within the larger government affairs fun= ction in Europe (which, in turn, has created issues of morale).  These issu= es, in my mind, are of sufficient concern that, if left unaddressed, the gr= oup's ability to sustain a record of providing excellent support throughout=  the organization may, in time, be in jeopardy.  I am confident that, by na= ming a team leader, we will retain virtually all of the benefits of the col= lective leadership approach that are embodied in the current structure, chi= ef among them,  greater participation from both Eric and Richard on an ongo= ing basis.  What we will gain, however, by the designation of a team leader= , is increased and sustained attention to the issues that I have already me= ntioned. =20  The person that I believe is best suited for this team leadership role is P= aul Dawson. =20 My observations, relative to Paul, are that he understands the needs of the=  individuals within the group and will do everything that he can to ensure = that personnel issues are handled in a fair and expeditious manner.  In add= ition, Paul has a very sound grasp of many, if not all, of the issues facin= g Enron Europe and will provide, I believe, consistent leadership on substa= nce as well as on personnel and administrative issues.  It is also my expec= tation that Doug Wood, who has assumed many of the administrative responsib= ilities, e.g., budget, will continue to assist Paul in that capacity and th= at both Peter Styles and Paul Hennemeyer will also continue to participate = in a leadership role along with Paul Dawson and Doug.

On Monday, Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretian raised the Canadian softwood lumber issue with President Bush in the form of a veiled threat to withhold gas and oil (or perhaps pipeline projects) in response to the US measures against Canadian lumber.  While keeping trade open between the US and Canada is clearly in the best economic interests of both countries, this illustrates the threat that retaliation holds and the political nature of these decisions.  ? Previously the lack of Canada's political momentum was blamed on the lack of domestic pressure.  Since the scenario has changed with a 19.31% countervailing duty (CVD) imposed the volume appears to be increasing.  ? Canada's first response to the CVD determination was to announce that it would bring the dispute over the CVD on softwood lumber to the World Trade Organization (WTO).  No doubt that this will proceed; however, the WTO process takes years to reach final resolution and the duties remain in effect while the case runs its course.  ? On the US front, the Department of Commerce (DOC) agreed to align the decision deadlines of the final determinations - CVD and anti-dumping (AD) - meaning that the CVD final decision is delayed to match the AD final decision.  With all the extensions that are allowed - and that are expected in order to review the volumes of casework - the final decisions may not be released until sometime in February 2002. (FYI - the AD preliminary deadline in Sept. 24, but may be delayed)  ? Thus, any changes to come in the near term depend on political will.

"   -----Original Message----- From:  Alvarez, Ray   Sent: Thursday, August 23, 2001 11:44 AM To: Robertson, Linda; Steffes, James D.; Comnes, Alan; 'gfergus@brobeck.com'; 'adsmith@brobeck.com'; 'dwatkiss@bracepatt.com'; 'skelley@bracepatt.com'; Novosel, Sarah Subject: CA Proceeding; exposure; netting of purchases & sales; offset of receivables  I called a meeting among Linda Robertson, Gary Fergus, Amanda Smith and RA yesterday evening to compare notes on the status of the captioned matters and determine what activities we would need to undertake going forward.  The following matters were discussed:  1. Refund exposure / netting of purchases and sales 2. Receivable from ISO related to business conducted in various trade months 3. Receivable from PX related to business conducted in various trade months 4. Receivable related to the underscheduling penalty 5. Receivable related to the negative CTC  1. Regarding the first matter, Gary reviewed with us the initial numbers on California exposure relating to our sales in the ISO and PX markets, and our purchases in those markets which may potentially be used to offset this exposure.  We discussed the need to update this study in view of the new data recently provided by the ISO in the proceeding.  Gary will work with Charles River to move forward on this.  The new exposure/netting numbers should be available either at the end of this week, or the middle of next week, due to demands on Charles River related to a Monday filing deadline in the Pac NW proceeding.  A ""block forward"" issue related to our accounting for sales and purchases, and involving the inclusion of price data related to non-physical, swap transactions, will also be analyzed by Charles River to determine its effect on the numbers that are being generated by the ISO and its impact on our refund exposure.    2. I shared information related to money owed us by the ISO for business conducted in various trade months, developed with the help of Kit Blair.  This info takes the form of a certification by the chief financial officer of the ISO as to the correctness of various attached information, schedules and invoices generated by ISO and related to these various trade months.  Kit advises as of yesterday that we are owed $42,891,411 by the ISO.  3. Information was also shared with regard to amounts owed us by the PX for business conducted in various trade months.  This info took the form of an EPMI account summary on PX letterhead and an overview spread sheet (with accompanying backup data) apparently provided by ISO.  The contact person on this matter is Chris Stokley.  I do not have confirmation on an up to date figure yet from Chris, but my prior notes indicate that this receivable is approximately $8MM.  4. I also shared information on money due us by virtue of the underscheduling penalty mechanism.  Again, Kit Blair provided me this info, which consists of an ISO generated notice and schedule which indicates that EPMI is owed $33,838,246.08  5. Finally, I shared a spread sheet obtained from Wanda Curry, as to the magnitude of the negative CTC receivable.  The deliverables coming out of the meeting were for Gary and Amanda to take the lead in updating and developing the foregoing items into evidentiary proof/affidavits suitable for use in the proceeding, coordinating with us, Dan Watkiss / Shelby Kelley and the various contacts.  A listing of the contacts to be made and potential affiants/witnesses follows:   Contact for amounts owed us by ISO-  Kit Blair, Staff Trading Supt. Contact for amounts owed us by PX-  Chris Stokley, Associate Affiant for the info developed above- Murray O'Neil, Sr. Director Trading Supt.   Contact and affiant for negative CTC-  Wanda Curry, VP Risk Management Offset of purchases and sales-  Undefined; possibilities- Jan Acton, Seabron Adamson,        internal person?  I am available for the remainder of the week to help coordinate Gary and Amanda's communication with these contacts.  Alan Comes will be the primary coordinator next week during my absence; although I will be reachable on my cell should the need arise.

"Looks good to go.   -----Original Message----- From:  Dasovich, Jeff   Sent: Friday, August 24, 2001 4:12 PM To: Shapiro, Richard Subject: Message Points for Discussion with Bilas  The ""rate agreement"" between the California PUC and DWR is a monumental decision that will affect California ratepayers and the economy for decades. Virtually every stakeholder has complained about DWR's refusal to provide the information necessary to assess the validity of DWR's assessment of what it's ""rate requirement"" is. Absent a ""rate agreement"" that provides for public scrutiny at the Public Utilities Commission, there will be no public scrutiny of DWR's revenue requirement and no accountability applied to DWR's actions. The stakes are simply too high--$43 billion of contracts--to let that happen. There is ample time for 1) California to issue the bonds AND 2) the Commission to engage in the deliberation necessary to ensure that a) DWR provides the information necessary to assess its TRUE revenue requirement, b) DWR's actions are subject to public scrutiny now and going forward.

Last Saturday afternoon, when GT 11 was being taken off-line after what appeared as a very successful gas commissioning run, it encountered an abnormal response. They opened the Turbine today an showed severe damage. We do not know how long it may be out of service but it may be approximately three months.  The incident occurred while the turbine  was under Siemens custody during a commissioning event.  John Guidry will be discussing the Technology Assurance Agreement with Cliff Rankin to understand how it applies to the particular circunstances.  John Guidy will alert Dick Vincent to get our insurance personnel involved and perform our own investigation.  Orlando Gonzalez has a 9:00 AM meeting with Parente tomorrow about other issues, we will take the opportunity to inform him.  This is a significant event for the Lender's conference that we have scheduled Tuesday. The insurance protection question will be very pertinent.  I will communicate with Furnas management and the Ministry of Mines and Energy. I am sure that during the course of the day there will be more questions, including the press. We will discuss this tomorrow.   Caution. We need to be factual in our communications. There will be a human temptation to assign blame to someone (Siemens). We know what happened, we need to know why it happened, to determine what was the root-cause of the failure and how it may be avoided, and this may take weeks to determine, or never precisely determined.  From a PPA perspective, the Aditivo 4 that we just executed can cover the situation. The average output derived  from GT 11, drops to zero, the availability factor for this output will be considered 100% for future calculations. We will loose the revenue.

Last Saturday afternoon, when GT 11 was being taken off-line after what appeared as a very successful gas commissioning run, it encountered an abnormal response. They opened the Turbine today an showed severe damage. We do not know how long it may be out of service but it may be approximately three months.  The incident occurred while the turbine  was under Siemens custody during a commissioning event.  John Guidry will be discussing the Technology Assurance Agreement with Cliff Rankin to understand how it applies to the particular circunstances.  John Guidy will alert Dick Vincent to get our insurance personnel involved and perform our own investigation.  Orlando Gonzalez has a 9:00 AM meeting with Parente tomorrow about other issues, we will take the opportunity to inform him.  This is a significant event for the Lender's conference that we have scheduled Tuesday. The insurance protection question will be very pertinent.  I will communicate with Furnas management and the Ministry of Mines and Energy. I am sure that during the course of the day there will be more questions, including the press. We will discuss this tomorrow.   Caution. We need to be factual in our communications. There will be a human temptation to assign blame to someone (Siemens). We know what happened, we need to know why it happened, to determine what was the root-cause of the failure and how it may be avoided, and this may take weeks to determine, or never precisely determined.  From a PPA perspective, the Aditivo 4 that we just executed can cover the situation. The average output derived  from GT 11, drops to zero, the availability factor for this output will be considered 100% for future calculations. We will loose the revenue. Furnas will have market exposure for this parcel, which is very significant.

Subject: As the CAISO Turns:  CAISO involved in scam with CDWR to purchase excess power from CDWR's long-term contracts  Everyone,  This is hot news showing that the CAISO/CDWR relationship is even more cozy than we thought.  I am not sure how to best use this information, but this scam needs to be brought to the public's and FERC's attention.  1.  According to two sources, the CAISO is helping to bail Gov. Davis out of his high-priced CDWR long-term power contracts by purchasing CDWR's excess energy as an ""Out Of Market"" purchase---instead of purchasing real-time energy from the CAISO's Supplemental Energy auction as required by the CAISO Tariff.  The costs of purchasing this high-cost power is being charged to Scheduling Coordinators who are largely unaware of the CAISO's surreptitious transactions.  2.  This sweetheart deal violates the CAISO Tariff, which requires the CAISO to buy energy from its Supplemental Energy (Real-Time) auction first.  CAISO Tariff, Dispatch Protocol section 8.6.2 (d).  Only after the CAISO has used up the Supplemental Energy  bids, can the CAISO buy Out Of Market (""OOM"") energy.  If the CAISO were following the Tariff, CDWR's excess energy would be treated as an uninstructed deviation and CDWR would be paid the clearing price for Supplemental Energy---which is often as low as $0.00.  Therefore, under the Tariff the CAISO could have paid CDWR the same price paid to other SCs, but instead is buying it at a price agreeable to CDWR.    3.  By ignoring Supplemental Energy bids in favor of CDWR power, the CAISO is able to manipulate the price it pays for energy in the Supplemental Energy market.  Low CAISO demand for Supplemental Energy drives down prices.  The clearing price for Supplemental Energy has often been as low as $0.00.  Therefore, the CAISO gets to keep all excess energy on the grid for free.  If CDWR was not getting preferential treatment, its energy would be treated as excess energy, and it would get little or nothing for it.  4.  While there is no evidence that Gov. Davis has directed the CAISO to buy from CDWR first, this behavior clearly benefits Davis.  Absent the CAISO's purchases of CDWR's excess energy, CDWR would be forced to sell its energy at a huge loss in the open market (just like many other suppliers).  The media has been been making hay out of Davis's strategy of buying high and selling low.  Therefore, Davis and CDWR benefit by being able to offset some of their losses under the long-term contracts.  Of course, they are only able to offset their losses through a back-door deal with the CAISO.  5.  The costs of this expensive CDWR power are being passed through to unwitting Scheduling Coordinators who, frequently seeing 10-minute Ex Post prices of $0.00, expect that the cost of imbalance energy will be close to $0.00.  These SCs are in for a big surprise.  According to one source at Sierra Pacific, the CAISO charged him as much as $400/MWh for imbalance energy.  (Where is the price mitigation here?)  6.  Who benefits under this scam?  Davis and CDWR.  Who loses under this scam?  In-state generators who are currently obligated to sell to the CAISO; Scheduling Coordinators who overgenerate or that have negative imbalances; consumers who end up paying higher prices for energy.  7.  Sources:  Our client representative from the CAISO has confirmed this practice and ""the Friday Burrito,"" an industry insider publication mentioned it also.  8.  Here is the quote from the Friday Burrito:  ""There is another problem that is being introduced by the long-term contracts. The ISO is utilizing the DWR contracts as Out of Market (OOM) calls, thereby forcing the contract energy into the grid ahead of the supplemental energy bids in the balancing energy ex post (BEEP) market. As one of our faithful observers told me, ""The ISO will be billing some DRW/CERS long-term contracts to SCs as OOM energy. This has been confirmed by the ISO. This means there is no real-time price transparency. We may see an hourly ex-post price of, say, $15, but this will bear no resemblance to the eventual Real-Time settlement price. There is no way to estimate what the OOM charge was as the ISO doesn't post that information. The implication is that parties buying real-time energy will wait 90 days before theyhave any idea of the price. This sort of price uncertainty is completely contrary to the FERC's goals of creating open, transparent markets.""  9.

(Legal) Cc: DL-Portland Volume Mgmt Subject: 487 Revelation  Steve,  Here is a summary of what we have learned regarding how the CAISO is handling 487.  Kent at Sierra Power inquired to me why he was being charged 487, (487 is the charge code the CAISO uses when it has to go out of market, and purchase power that exceeds $150.00/mwh, 481 is the charge code they use to credit it back), for the same hours and intervals that both the INC and DEC prices were zero.  This was obviously very peculiar and nobody in VM knew the answer. So Caroline posed the question to Keoni at the CAISO.  His response was this:  that the CAISO is charging 487 regardless of the INC and DEC prices, to cover the forward market contracts signed by CDWR and CERS.  In effect, they are ignoring their tariff that states they are supposed to purchase power at the lowest price, and are in effect trying to recover costs for CDWR and CERS.     -Kit",j..kean@enron.com,richard.shapiro@enron.com,FW: As the CAISO Turns:  CAISO involved in scam with CDWR to  purchase excess power from CDWR's long-term contracts,2001-08-27 07:55:22-07:00,sent

Subject: As the CAISO Turns:  CAISO involved in scam with CDWR to purchase excess power from CDWR's long-term contracts  Everyone,  This is hot news showing that the CAISO/CDWR relationship is even more cozy than we thought.  I am not sure how to best use this information, but this scam needs to be brought to the public's and FERC's attention.  1.  According to two sources, the CAISO is helping to bail Gov. Davis out of his high-priced CDWR long-term power contracts by purchasing CDWR's excess energy as an ""Out Of Market"" purchase---instead of purchasing real-time energy from the CAISO's Supplemental Energy auction as required by the CAISO Tariff.  The costs of purchasing this high-cost power is being charged to Scheduling Coordinators who are largely unaware of the CAISO's surreptitious transactions.  2.  This sweetheart deal violates the CAISO Tariff, which requires the CAISO to buy energy from its Supplemental Energy (Real-Time) auction first.  CAISO Tariff, Dispatch Protocol section 8.6.2 (d).  Only after the CAISO has used up the Supplemental Energy  bids, can the CAISO buy Out Of Market (""OOM"") energy.  If the CAISO were following the Tariff, CDWR's excess energy would be treated as an uninstructed deviation and CDWR would be paid the clearing price for Supplemental Energy---which is often as low as $0.00.  Therefore, under the Tariff the CAISO could have paid CDWR the same price paid to other SCs, but instead is buying it at a price agreeable to CDWR.    3.  By ignoring Supplemental Energy bids in favor of CDWR power, the CAISO is able to manipulate the price it pays for energy in the Supplemental Energy market.  Low CAISO demand for Supplemental Energy drives down prices.  The clearing price for Supplemental Energy has often been as low as $0.00.  Therefore, the CAISO gets to keep all excess energy on the grid for free.  If CDWR was not getting preferential treatment, its energy would be treated as excess energy, and it would get little or nothing for it.  4.  While there is no evidence that Gov. Davis has directed the CAISO to buy from CDWR first, this behavior clearly benefits Davis.  Absent the CAISO's purchases of CDWR's excess energy, CDWR would be forced to sell its energy at a huge loss in the open market (just like many other suppliers).  The media has been been making hay out of Davis's strategy of buying high and selling low.  Therefore, Davis and CDWR benefit by being able to offset some of their losses under the long-term contracts.  Of course, they are only able to offset their losses through a back-door deal with the CAISO.  5.  The costs of this expensive CDWR power are being passed through to unwitting Scheduling Coordinators who, frequently seeing 10-minute Ex Post prices of $0.00, expect that the cost of imbalance energy will be close to $0.00.  These SCs are in for a big surprise.  According to one source at Sierra Pacific, the CAISO charged him as much as $400/MWh for imbalance energy.  (Where is the price mitigation here?)  6.  Who benefits under this scam?  Davis and CDWR.  Who loses under this scam?  In-state generators who are currently obligated to sell to the CAISO; Scheduling Coordinators who overgenerate or that have negative imbalances; consumers who end up paying higher prices for energy.  7.  Sources:  Our client representative from the CAISO has confirmed this practice and ""the Friday Burrito,"" an industry insider publication mentioned it also.  8.  Here is the quote from the Friday Burrito:  ""There is another problem that is being introduced by the long-term contracts. The ISO is utilizing the DWR contracts as Out of Market (OOM) calls, thereby forcing the contract energy into the grid ahead of the supplemental energy bids in the balancing energy ex post (BEEP) market. As one of our faithful observers told me, ""The ISO will be billing some DRW/CERS long-term contracts to SCs as OOM energy. This has been confirmed by the ISO. This means there is no real-time price transparency. We may see an hourly ex-post price of, say, $15, but this will bear no resemblance to the eventual Real-Time settlement price. There is no way to estimate what the OOM charge was as the ISO doesn't post that information. The implication is that parties buying real-time energy will wait 90 days before theyhave any idea of the price. This sort of price uncertainty is completely contrary to the FERC's goals of creating open, transparent markets.""  9.

(Legal) Cc: DL-Portland Volume Mgmt Subject: 487 Revelation  Steve,  Here is a summary of what we have learned regarding how the CAISO is handling 487.  Kent at Sierra Power inquired to me why he was being charged 487, (487 is the charge code the CAISO uses when it has to go out of market, and purchase power that exceeds $150.00/mwh, 481 is the charge code they use to credit it back), for the same hours and intervals that both the INC and DEC prices were zero.  This was obviously very peculiar and nobody in VM knew the answer. So Caroline posed the question to Keoni at the CAISO.  His response was this:  that the CAISO is charging 487 regardless of the INC and DEC prices, to cover the forward market contracts signed by CDWR and CERS.  In effect, they are ignoring their tariff that states they are supposed to purchase power at the lowest price, and are in effect trying to recover costs for CDWR and CERS.     -Kit","pat.shortridge@enron.com, jeff.dasovich@enron.com, linda.robertson@enron.com",richard.shapiro@enron.com,RE: As the CAISO Turns:  CAISO involved in scam with CDWR to  purchase excess power from CDWR's long-term contracts,2001-08-28 06:52:39-07:00,sent

"Rick, Please find below a news article by Reuters on the visit that Venezuela's foreign Minister, Luis Alfonso Davila, is paying to USG officials. In it is clearly reflected the tension of the Venezuelan Government towards the US: is its main customer for its main product so they need the US desperately, and on the other hand the rejection to the ""neoliberal"" capitalist system that the US represents, together with the embargo to Cuba issue. Regards, ALF  USA: Venezuelan minister seeks better ties with U.S.  08/27/2001  Reuters English News Service  (C) Reuters Limited 2001.   WASHINGTON, Aug 27 (Reuters) - Venezuelan Foreign Minister Luis Alfonso Davila said on Monday his country wants closer ties to the United States, but he opened his visit to Washington with a scathing attack on foreign and economic policies supported by the United States. ""There is a new religious dogma: neoliberalism. It asks us to bow submissively before globalization,"" Davila said in a speech at the Organization of American States after arriving in Washington from a visit to Havana. He said a ""perverse"" economic globalization, driven by a desire to accumulate wealth, was undermining peoples' cultural identities and leaving poor nations with large debts. The protest movement against globalization, which began in Seattle and flared up in violence in Quebec and Genoa this year, had prompted a rethinking of the world economy, he said. Davila also criticized the U.S. economic embargo against Cuba's Communist government, to which Venezuela has drawn close since President Hugo Chavez, a former military officer, was elected in 1998.  But Davila, who will meet on Tuesday with President George W. Bush's top adviser on Latin America, John Maisto, said Venezuela 's populist government wanted to improve its ties with the United States, its main oil market. He said Venezuela had opened its doors to foreign investment and had remained a trustworthy oil supplier, while supporting higher but stable prices for crude oil. ""Our government considers the United States to be a friend. We want to deepen our relations. They can be improved,"" Davila told reporters after his speech. Davila said Venezuela had offered to help the United States avoid an energy crisis. Venezuela , one of the United States' four top suppliers, has the largest oil reserves outside the Middle East. Chavez, who led a coup attempt in 1992, was elected with widespread popular support on a mandate to clean up corruption in Venezuela . He has annoyed Washington by criticizing U.S. policies in Latin America, mainly U.S. military aid to fight the drug war in neighboring Colombia, and by visiting Iraq and Libya to strengthen OPEC, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.

Weg"" <hweg@pgwlaw.com> 08/28/01 09:35PM >>> I have not heard back from all members of the Unofficial Committee regarding my email dated August 27, 2001 with respect to the proposal to contact the Governor and Legislators regarding the pending legislation on SCE.  Some have suggested that the message needs to be stronger and others have suggested that the message is too strong.  Our Ex Officio members BPA and WAPA want it to be clear that they are not involved in any way with addressing the state government on this or other issues.  As you know, I want very much to reach as broad of a consensus on this action as is possible, and to protect the interests of all members.  Virtually all members agree that a bankruptcy case for or litigation against SCE would probably not be a good thing and we do not want to advocate for bankruptcy or litigation.  After all, the Unofficial Committee was organized to provide a different approach generally.  The purpose of contacting the Governor and the Legislature is to let them know that the legislation they are now considering, which leaves SCE about $1 billion short on the proposed financing to pay creditors, may cause some other sellers to take precipitous action in filing an involuntary petitition or initiating litigation or arbitration that could delay or prevent the financing at even the lower $2.9 billion level, which will adversly affect SCE and all creditors generally. We should point out that not all sellers are in agreement on what action will be taken. The message is not intended to threaten anything and it is not necessarily designed to stop legislation altogether, only legislation that might actually make the situation worse for all sellers and SCE.  The tone of the presentation, if we make one, will be low key, non threatening, and in the spirit of helping the legislature and the Governor design a package that will avoid the bankruptcy, litigation and other alternatives that others might be forced to consider if the bill is passed, leaving the energy sellers out in the cold.  If there remain some members of the Committee that are not willing to be associated with the message outlined above, then I propose that we give such members the alternative of remaining members of the Unofficial Committee and allowing us, if asked, to identify any such members that prefer not to be a part of the message although they want to support an approach that avoids litigation and bankruptcy for SCE.  I understand that the LADWP and Coral Power would like this approach adopted.  As I explained in my prior email, it has been suggested that the proposed bill that leaves SCE short by a billion dollars will likely pass after Labor Day and before the Sept 14 adjournment.  That is why timing is important. Those of you that have not responed, please respond.  Those of you that were concerned that the message was unclear, please review this email and consider or reconsider your positions, as the case may be.  As of right now, there are only 11 votes: 9 in favor and 2 against.  The polls are still open so please let me know your position.  You should be aware that the City of Glendale notified me that it determined that actual or potential conflicts of interest with the Unofficial Committee required it to resign from the Unofficial Committee.","paul.kaufman@enron.com, jeff.dasovich@enron.com, d..steffes@enron.com",richard.shapiro@enron.com,RE: RE:New Unofficial Committee Contacting Decision Makers,2001-08-31 11:40:25-07:00,sent

Having a more junior person, such as Nalia, supporting EBS after the 1st of the year probably makes sense.  I think she would need some time working alongside Jan to get familiar with our issues.  She also may need to be able to pull Jan in from time to time to help with meetings where it is useful to have a more senior person.  From my conversations with Jan, I think he would be very willing to do this. ? I think it would be best for Jan to report to Peter or Paul Hennemeyer since most of his time will be spent on European energy issues.  It would be hard for Mona to assess his effectiveness in that role.  If he is already spending at least half of his time on those issues (which I think he is), then it probably makes sense to make that change now.    How's the Blue Tower Benini?

At that point we may feel Jan Haizmann could move to 75% or 100% energy related work (compared with 50% right now.) Jan's own preference would be to do so. He has a better grasp than most in our group of the pan-European and EU policy dynamics, and is rapidly mastering the energy network transmission specifics.  Jan thinks main future developments of interest on telecoms and e-commerce regulation/ policy fronts will be at EC level. He has suggested Nailia could play a useful role at a more junior level from 1/02. That woud have implications for both her EC related energy work and her current 30% allocation to Italian energy. I can also help out in relation to EBS of course, subject to our resource squeeze in the wake of Brendan's departure.  In the meantime I understand Sue is due to move to a different role in Houston, and that Mona Petronko in San Francisco may take the lead on North American EBS reg. affairs.

To be perfectly blunt, ISO is breaching many provisions of its tariff and FERC just stands by and watches.  Here are the top 5.  1.  governance -- has NEVER complied with the FERC rulings going back to the beginning in 1998 to be independent of state influence  -- as of Jan 2002, the CA ISO has been under the complete control of the Governor  2.  creditworthiness -- has been under FERC orders to have a creditworthy counterparty for EVERY transaction in its markets.  The CA Dept of Water resources said it would be that counterparty. DWR is also getting wads of money from the retail customers (via daily wire transfers by the utilities). Yet the ISO has only paid about 8% of the money it owes suppliers -- where's the money?  3.  illegal dispatching -- story by Jason Leopold a few days ago said that the ISO had ordered Southern CA Edison to reduce its baseload Mohave coal plant so it could buy expensive power from DWR -- this is something we've suspected but have had difficulty getting data on.  4.  out-of-market calls (OOM) -- ISO is obligated to use the least expensive power from its market to meet load.  If not enough power is available and reliability is threatened, then the ISO can go out-of-market"" and pay whatever it takes -- i.e. is not limited by the price cap -- to keep the lights on.  We believe that the ISO is doing this even when loads of cheap power is available in the market.  The ISO is going out and buyuing very expensive power from DWR -- this covers up DWR's bad contracts AND spreads the costs to all parties (not just DWR and the investor-owned utilities).  Further, DWR can create the ISO emergency and the need to make OOM calls in the first place simply by failing to schedule sufficient power to meet its load (even though it is swimming in excess power).  How sick is that?  5.  secrecy and lack of information -- this has always been an issue but since the takeover by the Governor it is even more difficult to get information and less data are appearing on the ISO's web site for public review. I predict this will continue to head downhill.  Feel free to call with questions.  I can go on for hours like this.

""I am pleased to announce some organisational changes to the European Government and Regulatory Affairs Group.

Paul will report directly to myself and will be strongly supported by the other senior members of the team: Doug Wood (Continental Gas), Peter Styles (EU and Continental Power) and Paul Hennemeyer (German speaking countries).  Richard Lewis and Eric Shaw will continue to work closely with the group with Rick Shapiro continuing to provide the team with strategic guidance to ensure that the European Government Affairs group is fully integrated within the global government affairs function.  I believe these changes will enable us to maintain Enron's leadership in regulatory efforts to broaden the markets available to us, to capitalise on regulatory changes and to continue the group's major contribution to our commercial success in the UK and Continental Europe  etc  Michael Brown""  Hope this is OK for a general announcement - not sure there is much more to say to the wider audience without dwelling on justifications and the finer points of how the respective responsibilities will pan out.

"Here it is!!  This is the new GTC that we've been working on with Legal and commercial.  It's getting closer to a final product.  FYI.  Lisa   -----Original Message----- From:  Van Hooser, Steve   Sent: Friday, September 07, 2001 10:07 AM To: Hoang, Charlie; Shivers, Lynn; Brooks, Erica; Hunter, Nicole; Saltiel, Robert; Saltiel, Robert; Crane, Bob; Malcolm, Rodney; Holzer, Eric; Comeaux, Clinton; Epstein, Jay; Hamilton, Daniel; Davis, Del; Mccrory, Ian; Lipsett, Roy; Daniel, John; Battaglia, Tim; Wright, Glenn; Hermans, Greg; O'Donnell, Kevin; McKone, Tim; Curry, Ken; Rajaram, Aparna; Yoho, Lisa; Huson, Margaret; Sweeney, Kevin; Castleman, Kent; Davis, Frank L.; Marshall, David; Hanson, Kristen J.; Moscoso, Michael E.; Wood, Shelly; McElroy, Braden; Glassford, David; Murray, Julia; Del vecchio, Peter; Stoler, Lou; Lindeman, Cheryl; Lyons, Dan; Griffin, Vanessa; Korkmas, Deb; George, Carolyn; 'bhafner@pgfm.com'; Seade, Jerry; Clark, Morris; Munslow, Peter Subject: New GTC (General Terms and Conditions) for use with EIM physical transactions  As some of you know, I have been promising that Legal would be rolling out a GTC for use in documenting EIM physical commodity transactions that are not governed by Master Purchase Sale Agreements or longer term Agreements.  Well, its finally ready to roll out, just in time for your light weekend reading!!  Currently the Steel Group confirms short term deals using a 12 page GTC and the Forest Products Group confirms deals using a 1 1/2 page GTC.  The attached unified form GTC represents a compromise between Steel and Forest Product; that is, its length is a miniscule 5 1/2 pages (excluding the Claims Procedure Appendices).  Aside for shrinking the Steel GTC and lengthening the Forest Products GTC, the new EIM GTC addressed parties' contracting rights if a Trade Event involving the imposition of trade duties or import/export restrictions messes up the economics of a Transaction.  As you all know, imports of Steel and Lumber into the U.S. are very sensitive issues that the Commerce Department, President and Congress are currently assessing and will act on within the next 5 months.  Legal has taken feedback and used it to craft a bilateral arrangement that acknowledges the effect of Trade Events.  Please let us know if this bilateral approach works for you.    The new EIM GTC addresses, in greater detail, how parties must proceed making claims as to defective products (i.e., a Defect Claim).  While I have received helpful suggestions from Del Davis and John Daniel, this area is the one that varies the most widely between Steel and Forest Products (as well as within the various commodities offered by such Groups).  Therefore it is the area that needs the most input and work from logistics, insurance and others that deal with these types of problems.  Keep in mind that any solutions you make should have a bilateral slant to them, as EIM will be both a Buyer and a Seller.  Too hard a position taken either way will come back to haunt us.  But please give me your input in this area--the pertinent sections are 6.1(c) and the 2 Appendices attached at the end.  If we need more specialized Appendices for other Commodities, please provide me details for same.  Legal would like the Documentation Group to make a mass mailing of the new EIM GTC to all current and former customers next week and start using the new GTC late next week, if possible.  I remain available to take your comments, typo fixes, suggested changes, deletions, additions, etc. with the goal of finalizing this document by the end of the day next Tuesday.  Please help me to meet that deadline by reviewing the attached as soon as possible.  Finally, I will be forwarding a Short Form (1 page) Confirmation that Steel and Forest Products will be able to use once the new EIM GTC is implemented.  We'll be able to abbreviate the Confirmation because all the FCPA, Governing Law, Assignment and non-deal terms will already be built into the GTC.

"I'm starting to get concerned about this.  A) I didn't pick the time.  B) I talked to Sue on Friday and she will be out of Church at 10 AM PDT and on the call shortly thereafter. Sue seemed more concerned about having a call at all then on the time.  If she expressed a view that the time was set up so that she couldn't be on the call, I'd like to discuss, since that didn't factor in at all.  As you know, having gone through Sandi, I'm extremely sensitive to inter-group relations.  If you feel there are issues that we should discuss, I'd really like to do it.  I react very strongly to any view that I am intentionally doing anything to get in Sue's---or others---way.  From my perspective, I feel strongly that I haven't behaved that way, and don't in any way intend to.  I simply have no desire to ""compete"" with colleagues, Sue in particular.  There aren't enough people to do all the work, and there's plenty of tasks, recognition, blame, etc. to go around.  These are extremely challenging times and we won't get anywhere unless it's truly a team effort.  I know that the SF office has a history of challenges with respect to California leadership. I have no interest in returning to the very un-teamlike atmosphere that existed previously, particularly since the atmosphere has changed so positively in the past few months.  For a variety of reasons, I have been asked to take on alot of tasks over the past year. I've tried very hard to perform well, while at the same time working hard with Paul and Sue to advance a significantly more healthy, inclusive, open and collegial working environment in California and the West.    I care alot of course about your perceptions, and if you have the preception that relations in the office is becoming an issue, I'd like to confront it head on.  And if Sue is expressing any concerns about how things are going generally---which she expresses to me from time to time---I'd like to sit down with you and Sue to discuss, if you think that would be useful.  Forgive the lengthy note, but having just gotten through the experience with Sandi, I'm not anxious to repeat, in any shape or form.  Talk to you at noon your time.

"   I am pleased to announce an organisational change within the European Government and Regulatory Affairs Group that will become effective immediately.  Paul Dawson will assume a leadership role for government and regulatory affairs across continental Europe in addition to his current UK responibilities.   Paul will report directly to myself and Rick Shapiro and will be strongly supported by the other senior members of the team: Doug Wood (Continental Gas), Peter Styles (EU and Continental Power) and Paul Hennemeyer (German speaking countries).  Richard Lewis and Eric Shaw will continue to work closely with the group along with Rick Shapiro who will continue to provide the team with strategic guidance to ensure that the European Government Affairs group is fully integrated within the global government affairs function.  I believe these changes will enable us to maintain Enron's leadership in regulatory efforts to broaden the markets available to us, to capitalise on regulatory changes and to continue the group's major contribution to our commercial success in the UK and Continental Europe.

"Rick,   I'm sending you an initial list of observations/frustrations related to the RTO effort that are going to need to be addressed very soon if we're going to be successful.    Public Affairs needs to get engaged in this effort.  Jim and Christi have set high expectations for how we deal with RTOs in the media.  Mark has designated Meredith P as the point person in Houston.  She is interested and getting up to speed.  Pat - while probably very capable - is slow to respond to deliverables and his prep work isn't up to par.  My gut feeling is to designate Meredith and let me and Sue work directly with her on this.  I need someone who is consistently available and who will meet the deadlines I set. The Northeast group needs to engage.  I have no idea what meetings have been set up with regulators or what feedback people are hearing.  Everyone else (Dan Staines, Marchris, John Shelk, Sue Landwehr, Janine, Christi, Sarah, are all totally engaged).  The Northeast needs to be more of a team player in this effort.

It doesn't seem to be moving however.  I've asked for updates/timeframe when we can get LIVELINK up and running for our RTO effort (I want an RTO calendar, a place for internal and external documents, filings, etc) and am not sure what's going on with it.

"Don't worry about Elizabeth and the LIVELINK piece.  She's been sick and has been focused on the budget meeting with Ken.  Once the meeting takes place (tomorrow) she told me that LIVELINK for RTOs is her #1 priority.  I'm hoping that by next week we'll have a place for all of our work.     In terms of the Northeast.  My first suggestion is to make the RTO effort a priority topic at your next Direct Report Meeting.  You'll need to emphasize the importance of communication feeding into Sue Nord and myself - consistent communication - not just when people feel like it.  Also should emphasize the reasoning behind having a strategic/political management group...and thus it calls for some new behavior on everyone's part.  People shouldn't be working in a box, they need to be encouraged to refer to the RTO org chart and remember our goal.  Our success on RTOs is dependent on everyone's action.  It's like a puzzle, if there is a piece missing it isn't complete.   I spoke with Meredith tonight.  Mark seems to be okay with coordinating with Quinn Gillespie now (which pleases me).  Meredith is the lead - she will be who I go to for all RTO public affairs efforts nationally.  Pat and QG will be her support team.  She wants to go and meet with QG and talk strategy in the next couple of weeks so I will coordinate that for us and keep you looped in.

"Rick,  Aleck and I have recently discussed the prospect of adding another individu= al to our Canadian team based in Calgary and Aleck invited me to prepare a = description of the need and our circumstances for your review.  =20  I understand Derek Davies and Rob Milnthorp spoke to John Lavorato about th= e need for additional support for our PPA exposure last week. They tell me = that John agreed with them that we need additional transmission rate design=  experience in-house in Calgary given we are exposed through our PPA positi= on to considerable transmission rate risk.  From Derek's and Rob's perspect= ive, the dedication of an additional individual to assist in managing outst= anding transmission rate related matters that have not yet been addressed (= and other issues that impact the value of our PPA) could be conservatively = quantified as in excess of $Cdn 80 million over the 20 year life of the PPA= .  While this person does not necessarily have to be in the Government Affa= irs Group, my sense is that our group would be a much better fit than havin= g the person join our commercial group.=20  Background  The Alberta Conservatives were re-elected with a significant majority in Ma= rch 2001 and is now in the early years of a new four year mandate.  The new=  Minister of Energy has reaffirmed the vision and commitment of the Alberta=  Government to electricity restructuring which started to a limited degree = in 1996 with the deregulation of generation and the creation of a power poo= l and transmission administrator.  Effective Jan 1, 2001 the formerly regul= ated generation was sold in the form of Power Purchase Arrangements and ret= ail customer choice for all classes of electricity customers was introduced= . =20  In late August 2000 Enron Canada purchased the 705 MW Sundance B PPA in the=  PPA Auction for an up front price of $Cdn 300 million and assumption of th= e fixed and variable costs over the 20 year (starting Jan 1, 2001) remainin= g base life of units 3 and 4 of the Sundance B Power Plant of approximately=  $Cdn 2 billion.  The Sundance Power Plant is owned by TransAlta Corporatio= n and located west of Edmonton in central Alberta. =20  In Q2 2001 Enron Canada launched Enron Direct in Alberta which is a retail = supplier of natural gas and electricity whose initial target market is comm= ercial customers of all sizes.  Enron Direct recently began operating in On= tario and will initially serve the same market segment as the Alberta opera= tion.  Enron Direct's initial business plan does not involve serving reside= ntial customers but it is expected that Enron Direct will expand its target=  market to include these customers within 1-2 years.=20  Current Government Affairs Coverage  Fino Tiberi joined the Government Affairs team on May 15, 2001 and his focu= s has been on dealing with market design and implementation issues that imp= act the risk profile and profitability of Enron Direct's retail electricity=  and gas business in Alberta.  In particular, the Alberta electricity retai= l market is in the very early stages of development and the first 9 months = of operation have revealed some significant design flaws in the initial set= tlement process that have implications for Enron Direct.  In addition, othe= r issues need to be addressed such as: exit fees, unreasonable distribution=  tariffs, lack of oversight of municipal utilities.  The government has ind= icated that one of its top priorities is address the problems with the pres= ent retail market design.  Fino has also had some limited involvement in su= pporting Enron Direct's retail initiative in Ontario and has recently began=  investigating the current status of the retail gas market in BC with a vie= w to advising Enron Direct on the requirements for entry and the market des= ign issues that must be addressed. =20  It is reasonable to assess the task of influencing retail market design and=  providing information/support to Enron Direct's commercial staff in Albert= a and Ontario as requiring Fino's full time attention for the next 2 years.  Since Fino's arrival, my focus has primarily been on providing input and co= mments to the Alberta Government, Power Pool of Alberta, Transmission Admin= istrator and AEUB on wholesale electricity matters and to a lesser extent s= ome retail gas matters (unbundling, code of conduct).  In addition, I have = been working closely with the Enron Canada commercial and legal groups on n= umerous issues that impact the value of, or relate to commercial opportunit= ies arising out of, the Sundance B PPA position.  This includes issues such=  as: Alberta Government approval to split the Sundance B PPA into two small= er PPAs for resale by Enron Canada, treatment of the unsold PPAs, transmiss= ion congestion issues, transmission tariff issues, energy import/export rul= es, power pool rule changes.  Transmission issues are of particular interes= t to Enron given Alberta's unique transmission rate design regime under whi= ch suppliers in Alberta pay 50% of the transmission revenue requirement.  M= any of these issues are complex and in many cases the implications of their=  outcome impact Enron Canada's Sundance PPA position by millions of dollars= .

T= his has worked, but it is clear that given the scope, complexity, and numbe= r of the issues in Alberta that we must be involved in given the value at r= isk of our Sundance PPA position, it can reasonably be concluded that the c= ost of these resources over the next two years will far exceed the cost of = a full time Director level Government Affairs staff member familiar with th= e Alberta electricity market design and more specifically the Power Pool an= d Transmission Administrator designs (including the TA's rates and tariff).=   In addition, these consultants are much less accessible to our commercial=  staff than a full-time employee.  =20  I anticipate the most substantial changes in the Alberta electricity market=  design will occur over the next 2 years as this is the period during which=  the Government itself, and via pressure on the institutions it oversees (A= EUB, Power Pool, TA), will implement changes with a view to then leaving a = period of two full years prior to the next provincial election for the mark= et to respond.

Randy is c= apable of providing immediate and valuable advice and input in the developm= ent of Enron Canada's participation in the transmission related matters tha= t could impact Enron Canada, including the STS Rate Schedule issue (the hea= ring will resume on Nov 19).  His technical background and experience along=  with his long term involvement in various Alberta electricity market issue= s would be of significant and immediate benefit to Enron Canada's commercia= l group.  Derek Davies has had some limited dealings with Randy (and has wa= tched Randy as one of EAL's witnesses at the STS hearing) and has been impr= essed with his knowledge and expertise. =20  Randy called me recently to advise that he was interested in leaving ESBI a= nd thought Enron would be a challenging and interesting place to work.  He = advised that the current salary (including bonus) for a person of his level=  at ESBI is between $Cdn 120,000 - 140,000.  If the position is approved, I=  would propose we not proceed through the normal recruiting process but rat= her immediately have Randy meet firstly with Aleck and I, then with Derek D= avies, Rob Milnthorp and myself, and then with Rick Shapiro, Harry Kingersk= i, Jim Steffes (in person or by video conference) Aleck and I.

Widespread but only partial news coverage was given recently to a remarkable editorial broadcast from Toronto by Gordon Sinclair, a Canadian television commentator. What follows is the full text of his broadcast.  ""This Canadian thinks it is time to speak up for the Americans as the most generous and possibly the least appreciated people on all the earth. Germany, Japan and, to a lesser extent, Britain and Italy were lifted out of the debris of war by the Americans who poured in billions of dollars and forgave other billions in debts. None of these countries is today paying even the interest on its remaining debts to the United States.  When France was in danger of collapsing in 1956, it was the Americans who propped it up, and their reward was to be insulted and swindled on the streets of Paris. I was there. I saw it.  When earthquakes hit distant cities, it is the United States that hurries in to help. This spring, 59 American communities were flattened by tornadoes. Nobody helped.  The Marshall Plan and the Truman Policy pumped billions of dollars into discouraged countries. Now newspapers in those countries are writing about the decadent, warmongering Americans.  I'd like to see just one of those countries that is gloating over the erosion of the United States dollar build its own airplane. Does any other country in the world have a plane to equal the Boeing Jumbo Jet, the Lockheed Tri-Star, or the Douglas DC10? If so, why don't they fly them? Why do all the International lines except Russia fly American Planes?  Why does no other land on earth even consider putting a man or woman on the moon? You talk about Japanese technocracy, and you get radios. You talk about German technocracy, and you get automobiles. You talk about American technocracy, and you find men on the moon - not once, but several times - and safely home again.  You talk about scandals, and the Americans put theirs right in the store window for everybody to look at. Even their draft-dodgers are not pursued and hounded. They are here on our streets, and most of them, unless they are breaking Canadian laws, are getting American dollars from ma and pa at home to spend here.  When the railways of France, Germany and India were breaking down through age, it was the Americans who rebuilt them.  When the Pennsylvania Railroad and the New York Central went broke, nobody loaned them an old caboose. Both are still broke.  I can name you 5000 times when the Americans raced to the help of other people in trouble. Can you name me even one time when someone else raced to the Americans in trouble? I don't think there was outside help even during the San Francisco earthquake.  Our neighbors have faced it alone, and I'm one Canadian who is damned tired of hearing them get kicked around. They will come out of this thing with their flag high. And when they do, they are entitled to thumb their nose at the lands that are gloating over their present troubles. I hope Canada is not one of those.""

Although not unexpected, but still disappointing, the Judge endorses the market design proposal of the New York and New England ISOs.  This market design proposal encompasses a long, drawn out process for discussing what the Northeast market should look like (minimum 12 months) before work begins to develop the new RTO.  The target implementation date of the ISOs is November, 2004, but the proposal clearly states that this time frame is ""subject to extension"" if new design requirements are introduced.  We believe the true intent of the ISOs is to delay indefinitely this process in order to retain the three existing ISO structures.  A copy of the Judge's report and the Business Plan are attached.  One good aspect of the Judge's report is that he asks in several areas of the report for Commission guidance.  We too believe this is necessary.  It became quite evident early in the mediation proceeding that we were not going to agree with the New York entities (or the New England ISO) on market design or governance.  We argued that FERC intended the new market design to be primarily the PJM system, with enhancements where possible.  Others, relying on the ambiguity in FERC's orders, argued that FERC really intended to create a new system, using PJM as the platform but pulling heavily from the other two ISOs, regardless of time or complication of creating this new market.  We need FERC direction on this, and the Judge makes this clear.  Background  The Judge's primary goal of this 45-day mediation process was simply to establish a ""business plan"" which lays out how and when a single Northeast RTO will be created.  Enron, along with many other participants, opposed this approach, arguing that we are wasting the 45 days given to us by the Commission.  The Judge acknowledges in his report that there was significant opposition to his approach but he thinks it worked out perfectly.  Although the majority of the Judge's report and the business plan focuses mainly on process for creating the business plan, he does discuss two substantive issues:  market design and governance.  Market Design  At the beginning of the mediation, PJM, NY and NE submitted a joint proposal for forming a single Northeast RTO.  This proposal envisions a time-intensive approached designed to reach agreement by all stakeholders, with an implementation date in 3-4 years (""Option 1-M""of the Business Plan).  This proposal is now supported by the New England and New York ISOs - PJM has its own approach (see below).  The New York transmission owners also submitted a proposal for implementing the new RTO in 3 years (""Option 2-M"" of the Business Plan).   PJM submitted an alternative proposal for creating and implementing a single Northeast RTO with a single day-ahead and real-time energy market by November 2003 (""Option 3-M"" of the Business Plan).    We took the lead in creating a coalition of marketers, generators, PJM TOs, industrials, and other end use customers (The One RTO Coalition) advocating the creation of a single energy market based on PJM's system by December 2002, but no later than May, 2003.  Although we (Enron) believe PJM's November 2003 time frame is too conservative, the coalition supports Option 3-M (PJM's approach) since it achieves the Coalition's goals, albeit on a slower timetable.    As noted above, the Judge endorses Option 1-M, in part because it has a built-in a process for determining ""Best Practices.""  Although PJM also conducted a ""best practices"" analysis, the other ISOs and NY TOs do not agree with PJM's determinations of what practices from their ISOs are ""best practices.""    The Judge acknowledges that support for Option 3-M (the PJM plan) ""far outstrips"" the other options in diversity and extent of stakeholder support.  However, the Judge believes that the PJM option assumes the PJM platform can work in New York and New England, even though there are more generation divestiture and load pocket issues in New York and New England than in PJM.  The Judge states that ""impatience, haste and greed"" should not be permitted to drive the RTO process ""at the expense of sound policy"" and that optimal RTO benefits should not be sacrificed in order to allow some to ""exploit more immediate economic opportunity in a sprint."" See Report, page 18.  Governance  The other substantive issues we have discussed are governance:  interim governance, final governance, board make-up and stakeholder process.  The Judge opted to not endorse any one of the options proposed - instead, he discusses the pros and cons of each option.  Here again, the Judge strongly urges the Commission to provide guidance to the participants on the Commission's preferred governance approach.  The Judge also suggests that a settlement judge may be helpful in assisting stakeholders in finalizing governance procedures.  PJM has stated that in order to meet its deadline of November 2003 (and certainly earlier), PJM has to be in control of the implementation of the new RTO.  PJM proposes that the new board be made up of board members from the existing ISOs:  5 from PJM, 3 from New York, and 2 from New England.  The Board elects a voting CEO (assumed to be Phil Harris if the PJM proposal wins).    NY ISO, New England ISO, NY PSC, NY TOs and New England TOs, along with other entities (primarily those who are afraid to cross New York PSC) all support equal representation on the new Board.  One proposal would have 3 board members from each ISO with a non-voting CEO.  The other proposal would have 3 board members from each ISO with 4 additional board members to be elected by stakeholders.    We support the PJM board make-up proposal to ensure a fast transition to a single Northeast RTO and energy market based on the PJM system.  Post Mediation  The Judge in his report recommends that the Commission issue an order resolving as many of the issues in dispute as possible and then establish further proceedings under the auspice of a settlement judge.    The Judge urges the Commission to not accept comments from participants, but he acknowledges that all participants want an opportunity to comment.  We are working on two sets of comments now, one on our own and one in conjunction with the One RTO Coalition.  We will circulate drafts as soon as they are prepared.  Although we are disappointed that the Judge did not endorse the PJM proposal, we still believe that the Commission is intent on implementing a single northeast RTO as soon as possible and that the PJM proposal provides a well-reasoned (even conservative) approach to reaching that goal.  Therefore, even though the Judge sided with New York, we are hopeful that the Commission will stick to its guns and go with the PJM proposal.  Please call any one of us if you have any questions or would like to discuss the Report.

Ho= wever, since complete consensus was not reached, FERC should provide its de= termination of which of the two models best meets FERC's expectations as a = platform for the SE Power Grid RTO.  This should be done by FERC quickly.  = There should be no further delay.  Regardless of the model, FERC should enc= ourage the collaborative process.  She thinks that this should be done by t= he parties without FERC intervention except to the extent to respond to FER= C orders. (I think FERC staff should be involved or it will get bogged down= ).  Parties should reconvene within 15 days after FERC's order adopting a m= odel and the FERC order should direct the participants (like us) to submit = a joint proposal within 45 days thereafter.  She recommends to FERC that pa= rties be allowed to file comments to FERC within 20 days (however, she reco= mmends against permitting reply comments since they may prove counterproduc= tive to the collaborative nature of the mediation process.)  The Commission=  will then issue an order that can adopt her recommendations, may reject he= r recommendations, or change something.  I would expect that the Commission=  would adopt many of her recommendations, while allowing further mediated-t= ype discussions on some issues (hopefully, FERC will adopt many of our sugg= ested changes).  Judge McCartney then basically describes both proposals of=  the Grid Group and the Southern, etal. group, then provides the stakeholde= r participants' comments (almost verbatim from all submissions to her).

This is good because Enron generally favors the Grid = model.

(2) concerned about cost shiftin= g:  mediation team discussed phase in of rates that the Commission has allo= wed. (3) Concern that SE RTO would preempt state ability to approve asset t= ransfers to RTO and want state retail customers to receive full value for a= ssets.

I think our message for any press discussions tomorrow should focus on the = extremely beneficial aspects of the mediation and the significant ""jump sta= rt"" it gave to the SE RTO process due to the significant role played by Jud= ge McCartney and her team on focusing the discussions.  Furthermore, the in= itial results after 45 days show the majority of participants favoring a ""b= est practices"" PJM/SPP cornerstone type real time spot energy market with L= MP pricing and financial congestion hedges and an RTO with an independent b= oard structure that accommodates a for-profit RTO entity with a significant=  stakeholder advisory process.

If so, details? [Allegretti, Daniel]    Yes.  The DPUC issued a draft decision which declines to fund the project from the Conservation and Load Management Fund.  The decision praises the project in the text but includes a footnote which is critical of the project.  In addition, the DPUC issued a press release which is not helpful in promoting the project.  The decision not to fund out of the C&LM fund was not unexpected.  The chairman of the DPUC has been very supportive, along with Governor Rowland, but has been working offline to fund the project instead from the Renewable Energy Investment Fund.  Although the REIF is a much smaller fund it appears the REIF is able to borrow against future receipts and is willing to do so based in part on their expectation of increased funding next legislative session.  We are meeting with the REIF director next Wednesday to confirm where this stands.  In the mean time we have filed exceptions to the draft decision which goes final tomorrow.  We are told that the offending footnote will be removed but that the decision not to commit the C&LM fund will remain unchanged.  In sum, the project has suffered a very real setback but has not at this time been abandoned by EPMI.

"Rick, Thanks for keep me posted. This is a rumor and only a rumor, but someone very close to Jos? Vicente Rangel, the civilian Defense Minister, told us in Caracas that we should expect good news for the LNG project. The stars seem to be in position for this rumor to be true, though, given Richardson's letter, our conversation with the Governor, and his conversation with the Minister of Energy and Mines. And if true, Richardson will have definitely helped. I'll keep you posted when I have more definite news.

Chavez   FYI  -----Original Message----- From:  Hardy Jr, John   Sent: Wednesday, September 19, 2001 9:47 AM To: Gonzales, Eric; Vicens, Emilio; Gerstandt, Neal; Caranti, Guido Cc: Shapiro, Richard Subject: Discussion with Rep.Ballinger's staffer re meeting with Pres. Chavez    Gents  I spoke to Ted Brennan, staffer for Cong. Ballenger, about the meeting the Congressman had with Pres Chavez.  Brennan stated that Ballenger raised a number of requests from his constituents over the course of the meeting which Chavez either acknowledged without really responding or said he would look into.  The Jose project I understand was not raised directly with the President though it was raised with the AmCham and other parties in the government that the Congressman spoke to.  Brennan commented that the President was preoccupied with the petroleum sector and views oil production as the key to helping the poor.  The President was not inclined, apparently, in this meeting,  to discuss diversification in investment so it was hard for the Congressman to engage him in a discussion about projects outside of the oil sector.  A refinery project was discussed as well as several other oil related projects.  But Brennan's view is that the President does not see as much value in investment outside of the petroleum sector as he does in additional investment in the sector.  Brennan also commented that there is real concern about possible nationalisation of projects in the oil sector.    On a related track, I understand that the Administration's energy bilateral with Venezuela has been pushed back from the 20th into October.  DOE has indicated they have a number of concerns to raise with Chavez about the direction of their energy program, including the government's lack of action on Jose.  So we are clearly on the agenda, and I think probably the number one issue on the gas side.  I strongly recommend we contact the U.S. Ambassador and work with her to speak to the President about Jose.  I do not believe the intervention of private parties will get the project closed, but rather only the weight of the USG will be able to do it at this point.  thanks John    ",richard.shapiro@enron.com,alberto.levy@enron.com,Re: FW: Discussion with Rep.Ballinger's staffer re meeting with  Pres.

"Good e-mail.   -----Original Message----- From:  Steffes, James D.   Sent: Wednesday, September 19, 2001 12:12 PM To: Ryall, Jean; Twiggs, Thane; Keene, Patrick; Lawner, Leslie; Ogenyi, Gloria; Nicolay, Christi L.; Lindberg, Susan Cc: Shapiro, Richard; Noske, Linda J.; Kingerski, Harry Subject: Texas Market Issues  Thanks for the informative phone call this morning.  Having the key issues presented in one place was very helpful.  To follow up on the meeting, the following are action items for the group.  1. December 1 Market Readiness Update Meeting  Thane Twiggs (wholesale) and Nancy Hetrick (retail) will have at this time an understanding of the billing and settlement issues (or not) with their respective areas.  We need to ensure that EES and EPMI are able to get the necessary information to make sure that their bills and settlements are working and that we can bill our retail customers.  I will ask Linda Noske to set up this meeting.  If anyone hears anything else about the market delay, please let Jean Ryall know immediately.  As of right now, it is my impression that we all agree there is no delay scheduled???  2. Congestion Pass thru to EES' Retail Customers  Thane Twiggs, Nancy Hetrick and Jim Steffes will get with EWS and EES counter parties to try and work through the ability of EES passing thru congestion to its customers per the contract language.  I will lead the process of consulting with EES legal.  3. Wholesale Issues (Thane Twiggs)  a. Define workable TCR Product  b. End Balanced Schedule requirement  c. Fix Capacity Auction process, including credit matters d. BENA/OOM/AS e. Settlement & Billing  4. Retail Issues  a. REP - ISO - Utility Interface (Nancy Hetrick) b. Reliant PTB (Pat Keene) c. TXU PTB (Pat Keene) d. Reliant Negative CTC (Pat Keene) e. TXU Negative CTC (Pat Keene) f. EES / EPMI License (Gloria Ogenyi + Nancy Hetrick)  5. Information Flow  All policy statements from anyone within Government Affairs should be first vetted with Jean Ryall to ensure consistency and conformity.  Also, all people on the TO: list above should be included on all e-mail traffic.  I know this may sometimes slow down response to business people, but I think that we can all agree that no one has all the information in this very fast moving environment and unless we have a central clearinghouse we may send the wrong messages.  It is also critical that all commercial people interested in Texas need to hear about the latest.  By having Jean Ryall in the center, she will be able to ensure that no one feels ""cut out"".  The bi-weekly meeting should be held with Jean Ryall as Host to follow these issues in a timely manner.    6. Wholesale Products  Thane Twiggs was going to keep the team apprised of our products and pricing info on a regular basis so we are informed about the market.  Finally, it is critical that everyone work together to get the best results possible for Enron in the Texas market.  This is our ""home"" base - we need to make sure that our business efforts win big.    Thanks for everything ya'll have been doing to achieve this result.

The vast majority of our=20 people -- and indeed, the vast majority of people around the=20 world -- immediately and instinctively saw the terrorist attacks=20 as an unmitigated act of evil, whatever their views on American=20 policies at home or abroad. =20  But on the political fringes of our country, there were some who=20 just as instinctively reached for explanations in which Americans,=20 in the end, were at least partly responsible for our own tragic=20 misfortune. =20  In the current issue of The Nation, Robert Fisk deplores the=20 terrorist attacks, but then all but equates them to a variety of U.S.=20 and Israeli actions: ""the sanctions that have destroyed the lives=20 of perhaps half a million children in Iraq,"" the ""17,500 civilians=20 killed in Israel's 1982 invasion of Lebanon,"" etc., etc.  No, says=20 Fisk, you can't blame anyone else for the September 11 attacks,=20 but ""the malign influence of history and our share in its burden=20 must surely stand in the dark with the suicide bombers.""  This=20 slippery line of reasoning is, of course, being echoed on television=20 each night by a variety of ""Middle East experts"" who begin by=20 deploring the terrorists, but who eventually get around to blaming=20 America for not forcing Israel to cave into Palestinian demands,=20 thus ""angering"" public opinion in Arab and other Islamic countries. =20  On the Right, there was a breathtaking example of ""blame=20 America"" opinion from none other than the Reverends Jerry=20 Falwell and Pat Robertson, on the latter's Christian Broadcasting=20 Network.  Quoth Falwell: ""I really believe that the pagans and the=20 abortionists and the feminists and the gays and the lesbians who=20 are actively trying to make that an alternative lifestyle, the ACLU=20 and the People for the American Way -- all of them who have=20 tried to secularize America -- I point the finger in their face and=20 say, 'You helped this happen.'=05  God continues to lift the curtain=20 and allow the enemies of America to give us probably what we=20 deserve.""  Robertson quickly replied, ""Jerry, that's my feeling."" =20 Perhaps the dozens of conservative politicians and commentators=20 who last year vilified Senator John McCain for calling Falwell and=20 Robertson ""extremists"" owe the Arizona Senator an apology. =20  These sporadic expressions of ""blame America"" sentiment have=20 been relatively rare.  But they are eerily congruent with the rhetoric=20 of terrorists aflame at the alleged arrogance or wickedness of=20 America.  Those on the Left who demonize our Middle East=20 policies or our support for economic globalization, and those on=20 the Right who are convinced that our culture is fatally decadent,=20 should prayerfully reflect on this congruence.

Subject:=09ERCOT Residential/Industrial Service Mix Requirements   Ed,  Residential Obligation Section 39.352(g) of Senate Bill 7 provides that for any REP serving an agg= regate load in excess of 300 MW, 5% of the load must consist of residential=  customers. A REP can fulfil this requirement by: 1. Demonstrating that it directly serves residential load amounting to 5% o= f its total load 2. That another REP serves the residential load on its behalf, or 3. It pays 1 dollar per MWH of required 5% load into the System Benefit Fun= d.  EES can fulfil its obligation by entering into an agreement with New Power=  to serve residential load on its behalf, or can pay the 1$ per MWH penalty= . There is an annual compliance reporting requirement and EES can demonstrate=  compliance if it has an agreement with New Power.  EES Contract, For price to beat customers, the utilities have by Commission rule, the obl= igation to allow customers to come and go without restraint for the 5 year = period conmmencing 1/2/02. The Commission concern may be that Enron will ab= use this provision by gaming the system. The Enron contracts as currently w= ritten are within the rules as approved by the Commission. Until the utilit= ies move to amend the relevant rules, the Commission can only exercise its = displeasure by appropriate oversight and enforcement to determine what cond= uct amounts to abuse and gaming. I think it will ultimately be a question o= f degree and pattern of switching. The onus will be on the affiliated REPs = to prove abuse and gaming. Fundamentally, it is in the best interest of the=  market to allow customers to come and go. Customer mobility is the best cu= stomer protection in a competitive market. Besides, a restraint on customer=  mobility could have a chilling effect on competition as it will increase c= ustomer inertia. The Commission will carefully weigh any course of action t= o insure that they achieve a reasonable balance. For larger than 1MW custom= ers, they can agree to long term contracts and a restriction on their abili= ty to come and go.

Subject: FW: SPOT price reduced from 684 to 336 a few days before Eletrobolt is comissioned  Rick, Jim  For your information   Eletrobolt was inaugurated yesterday. Early this week, the government reduced the spot price from R$ 684/MWh  to 336. This is not only a significant loss to Eletrobolt, but also reduces in half our Annex V financial boost. I think that the decision not to run the plant, as proposed by our folks in Sao Paulo is adequate as a bargaining tool. I offered support to build stronger arguments why it does not make sense to reduce the price to 336. Government is using an argument that the market clearing price in the secondary market for quotas has been much lower thatn 684. In my view, the secondary market for quotas is a biased sample, which reflects the lowest willingness to pay in the demand curve. (the most elastic part of it). Therefore, it should not be used as a proxy for the average cost of rationing.  Sergio will be able to provide more details.

Afinal, o governo ja havia decidido pelos 684 ate o fim do racionamento (como bem diz o Fred, a termica racionamento continua ligada). A gente sabia que cedo ou tarde a tentacao do cap voltaria a baila.   Acho que a decisao da Enron noticiada na imprensa de interromper a producao como forma de pressao e adequada. O unico risco e que se chover muito a janela de oportunidade vai ficando mais estreita e o nosso poder de barganha se dissipa no tempo.  Curiso, mas esperado, ver a serie de rea'coes na imprensa citando a Enron como especuladora (Cascaes) e o absurdo que e o pre'co 684, haja vista o preco ex-post praticado nos leiloes. Para contrapor este ultimo argumento, a meu ver falacioso, e preciso ter em mente que o preco dos leiloes refleta unicamente a disposicao em pagar de uma amostra muito pequena dos consumidores, basicamente os eletro intensivos. A disposicao em pagar, cf estudo recente  da PSR varia de 200 a 13,00 /MWh; os precos dos leiloes refletem apenas o primeiro quartil. Nao da pois para afirmar com base nos precos dos leiloes que o 684 esta errado. O que sim esta errado e termos um valor unico para custo do deficit, quando ele deveria ser patamarizado. Mesmo assim, como o racionamento e linear para todas as classes, faz sentido usar um custo do deficit medio, que obviamente e e sempre sera diferente do pre'co pago nos leiloes por um grupo de consumidores com as menores disposicoes em pagar possivels.  Em se mantendo o 336, ter-se-ia necessariamente que revisar a penalidade dos consumidores residenciais (nas quais o fator de 3:1 guarda rela'cao com preco 684 bem como o bonus, que implica em um custo de deficit de 1000). Divorciar estas coisas (o mercado de atacado do de varejo) era a essencia da proposta do Mauro Arce em maio de 2001, a qual eu qualifiquei de o pior dos tres mundos, e gerou todo o rebu que voces sabem (anexo). ??  ??Avise se posso ajudar em elaborar melhor estes argumentos??LM","b..sanders@enron.com, e..haedicke@enron.com",richard.shapiro@enron.com,FW: SPOT price reduced from 684 to 336 a few days before Eletrobolt  is comissioned,2001-09-26 08:32:47-07:00,sent

TVA had at least six representatives at the meeting.  Four of the TVA representatives gave presentations on the issues being considered by this committee.  These are the main points TVA emphasized:  ? Transmission capacity is a limited resource, and TVA is near the limits of its capacity to handle further capacity ? TVA is very concerned about the implications of the open access rules being discussed as part of the national energy policy ? TVA's customers should be concerned about how changes in the energy industry will affect them  TVA's presentation was loosely structured around the following questions posed by the committee prior to today's meeting.  ? How reliable is TVA's power? ? How much available power does TVA have? ? What is the quality of TVA's power resources? ? What are the forecasts for energy costs? ? What environmental concerns are involved with the location of energy facilities?  As you can see, the questions are very broad, and were essentially a vehicle to allow TVA to crow about its abilities as an electric generator/supplier and to give subtle warnings about the dire consequences that would accompany the proliferation of private energy plants.  January 2001 RFP  TVA was asked whether the interest in Tennessee for merchant power plants was directly related to the RFP issued by TVA in January 2001.  This RFP is for 600 MW to be sold to TVA beginning in 2004.  TVA responded that it was possible that only one plant would be used to provide the 600 MW, and that the dozens of plants being planned in Tennessee would not be selling electricity to TVA.  This led to comments from the committee that most of these plants would not materialize once TVA awarded the RFP.  Incidentally, TVA stated that 80 proposals had been received in response to the RFP, and the companies still on the short list of contenders for the RFP have been notified, although TVA did not disclose the names of the short-listed companies.  TVA added that the company chosen from the RFP would not be required to have the plant fully permitted at the time of the award.  Water supply  TVA was asked if they had studied the impact that these facilities would have on Tennessee's water supply.  TVA said they had not studied this situation (editorial comment: TVA has been the chief public critic of the disastrous amount of water these plants would use.)  TVA did say they had 100 years of records, which they could use to project water flows.  Air quality considerations  TVA spent a great deal of time discussing NOx emissions and admitted that they were responsible for 25% of NOx emissions in Tennessee.  TVA claimed to be going forward with plans to reduce NOx emissions as required by an EPA order issued in 1999.  They said their emissions would be down to 200,000 tons of NOx in 2005, compared to the 530,000 tons emitted in 1996.  They did not mention that they are trying to get negotiate with the EPA for a more favorable level of NOx reductions.  TVA warned that the state should ""look closely"" and ""carefully consider"" the permitting of any new NOx sources because of the NOx reduction requirements being imposed by the EPA.  Transmission issues  TVA has 33,000 MW of transmission capacity.  TVA said use of their transmission capacity has ""skyrocketed"" in the last 3 years.  There were 25,000 transmission transactions on TVA's system in 1997.  There were 250,000 transmissions in 2000.  TVA said they are working hard to protect their current policy requiring power plant owners to absorb the cost of upgrades and connections required when non-TVA power generators use TVA's transmission system.  They acknowledged that the Bush administration energy policy is moving toward a requirement that the cost be ""societized"" i.e., absorbed by ratepayers.  TVA identified the following as ""threats"":  ? Adding generators to the their grid without adequate infrastructure ? Treating their system as an open market before tools to manage the system are available   TVA said its transmission grid is reaching its limits, and it would take a tremendous amount of time and money to build new infrastructure to handle the number of private plants now considering locating in Tennessee.  When asked about plans for this infrastructure, TVA indicated they had done preliminary planning for potential infrastructure upgrades.  TVA said there are over 120 pending requests for interconnection with TVA's transmission system.  ""Protection of Tennessee electric consumers""  TVA said its guidelines for electricity distribution are based on standard practices to ""protect TVA's native base customers"".  They said proposed FERC rules would provide protection for ""other users of the transmission grid"" and lessen the protection for TVA customers.  Conclusion; Future meetings  At the end of the meeting, Environment and Conservation Commissioner Milton Hamilton, who co-chairs this committee, said his department needs expertise on the ""cutting edge environmental and production technology"" that is available for energy plants.  TVA said their Public Policy Institute that would be glad to assist the state with technology issues.  It was not clear whether Commissioner Hamilton accepted this offer or would seek out other disinterested parties for help.  Economic and Community Development Deputy Commissioner, Tony Grande, the committee's other co-chair, said the committee may schedule another meeting after the September 26th public comment meeting to hear from the merchant power companies in a setting similar to the setting of today's meeting.   Gif Thornton and I would like to talk to you at your convenience on Thursday or Friday to discuss whether it would be in Enron's best interest to submit or make public comments at the September 26th meeting.

Some of the key actions are:  DSTAR and RTO West are to be ""married,""  The FERC wants a single western RTO but will wait on making CAISO merge with other western RTOs so that California can ""heal its wounds.""  Every utility needs to declare which RTO it plans to join by 12/1/01 (or possibly 12/15; not sure of date).  Otherwise the utility will lose market-based rates, will be unable to get a merger approved, and will have its transmission rev req. scrutinized. The commission favors 1 market structure applied to the four nationwide RTOs.   It plans on holding a week of workshops and issuing a NOPR to determine this structure.  The goal is to essentially re-issue the Order 888 tariff in a form that encompases the new functions of RTOs.  Although consistent business rules applied to large geographic markets are a good thing, expect this new effort and redefining the RTO to delay ultimate implementation. Although California will be allowed to heal, it is ordering an operational audit of the Calfornia ISO. Separately the FERC indicated the plan to issue a NOPR on market power and market based rates.   Expect new rules and procedure to determine whether a market is sufficiently competitive to allow for market based rates.  Further summary, prepared by Sarah Novosel in our Govt. Affairs DC office, is provided below:  Alan Comnes   The Commission held its first open meeting with Pat Wood as the new Chairman today and discussed many interesting issues.  The following is a summary of the meeting.  The meeting is still going on, and we will provide an addendum to this email updating you on what was discussed this afternoon (regarding market power).  RTOs   Chairman Wood expressed his desire to finish the RTO transition, and that the Commission needs to provide guidance and leadership in order to speed up the RTO transition.  Chairman Wood considers the RTO effort on two tracks:  1) organizational -- what will the RTO organizations look like, and 2) substantive -- once you set up the organizations, what will they do.  Organizational Effort:  Wood stated that this effort has already begun with the July 12 orders and the Northeast and Southeast mediation efforts.  The Commission will be issuing additional orders in the northeast, southeast and Midwest within the next couple of FERC meetings.  Wood also stated that it is time for RTO West and Desert Star to ""marry up,"" meaning, I suppose, that the two should consolidate.  Wood does not think that California can be included in the western RTO yet since it has lingering problems.  Structural Effort:  The Commission will initiate a section 206 proceeding to address market design and structure issues in order to translate the 8 functions established in Order No. 2000 into RTO structures.  To achieve this goal, the Commission is establishing an ""RTO week"" of advanced workshops, from October 15-19, in advance of issuing a NOPR, to address structural issues such as:  congestion management; cost recovery; market monitoring; transmission planning; reliability; transmission rights.  Wood also envisions that the Commission will develop a new pro forma tariff to replace the existing Order No. 888 transmission tariff.  The new tariff will apply to all public utilities and RTOs.  Wood also recognized that some ""sticks"" are needed to entice RTO participation.  Therefore, Wood proposes to have all public utilities come in by December 15, 2001 with a declaration to join an RTO.  If they do not make this declaration, these entities will have their market based rate authority revoked on a prospective basis.  Furthermore, Wood states that if entities do not join RTOs, they should not be authorized to merge their facilities, and that FERC will also look at their rates to determine whether they are still just and reasonable rates compared with rates offered by RTOs.  Wood states that these ""sticks"" provide incentive, but do not mandate, RTO participation.  With regard to the pending requests for rehearing, Wood asked legal staff to figure out how ""FERC can get there.""  In other words, I think Wood is telling them to develop the legal analysis for denying rehearing.  While Commissioner Breathitt is skeptical about some of these RTO proposals, because she was not required to vote on anything today, she only expressed her concern.  Upcoming Dates   October 15-19 -- RTO Workshops  End of October -- further orders on Northeast, Southeast, Midwest RTOs  December 15, 2001 -- all public utilities must commit to an RTO or have their market based rates revoked   Proposed Rule for Standards of Conduct  Within the next few days, FERC will be issuing a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (""NOPR"") on standards of conduct for transmission providers.  As explained at the meeting (we do not have a copy of the NOPR yet), the NOPR will propose to apply standards of conduct uniformly to electric transmission providers and gas pipeline transportation providers similarly.  The NOPR also proposes to broaden the definition of affiliate to include all energy affiliates, not just marketers.  The standards of conduct would not apply to RTOs and transmission providers who are members of an RTO may ask for an exemption from the standards.  The NOPR will also likely include a proposal that the standards apply to transmission-owners' marketing affiliates that are serving native load customers.  As you know, the present standards do not apply to the affiliates of TOs that are only buying and selling power for native load customers.  As the interim general counsel noted, these marketing affiliates can go into the control room and have unrestricted interaction with the TO.    There was some discussion of whether it is necessary to apply the standards to affiliates serving native load.  Staff told the Commissioners that market participants have been complaining for years about this loop hole in the rules.  Pat Wood said they will include the proposal in the NOPR (Breathitt may not support), but if the industry does not support the proposal, FERC will pull it.  We of course will strongly support the proposal.  Provision of Adequate Electrical Capacity (ICAP)  Chairman Wood asked Staff to prepare a presentation on reserves and installed capacity requirements.  Wood noted that the Commission had to issue an order on ICAP in New England during their recess in August, and he is not that familiar with the issues.  Therefore, he asked Staff to prepare a presentation, which they made at the meeting this morning.  The presentation will be made public within the next couple of days.  In sum, Staff seems to believe that some type of ICAP requirement is needed for reliability.    After the presentation, Wood noted that the New England ICAP order has enough wiggle room to allow the Commission to change its mind once the commissioners better understand the issue.  Wood sees that there is a potential conflict between decentralized, competitive markets and the need for sufficient supply (without politically unacceptable, prolonged price spikes).    Commissioner Brownell (from the Pennsylvania PUC) has a better understanding of  ICAP and expressed concerns that ICAP may be an outdated tool that acts as a barrier to entry without any definable benefit to customers.    Realizing that there are many positions on this topic, Chairman Wood said he will publish the Staff report and ask for comments by October 17.  We will definitely submit comments on this and will include everyone in the drafting process.  Sorry this is so long, but a lot happened today.  We will provide a summary of the market power discussion as soon as it is over.  Let us know if you have any questions.

NERC is about as secure as a convenience store at two in the morning.  They have almost no experience dealing with security, either cyber or otherwise. They are using the terrorist attacks on the 11th as a reason to blow the dust off all their old Y2K contingency plans and cash in on people's fears to strengthen their position.  In any case, I would suspect that a large RTO with a significant budget is much more likely to be secure than a dues based NERC. Look at NERC's offices.  They are in a shopping mall.  How secure is that?  Last time I visited, they didn't even have any sort of identity cards or badge system or anything - the whole place was wide open.  Anyone could walk in off the street and shut down a large portion of NERC's infrastructure by just randomly unplugging computers.    Contrast that with places like ISO-NE and NY-ISO, who have significant levels of security in their systems that are extremely sophisticated and complex. Or compare that with the MISO's hardened facility, capable of withstanding an F-4 tornado hit.  You tell me whether NERC or RTOs are going to be more secure.  Dave is right on with his classification of the idea of NIMDA being an attack on the electric utility industry as preposterous.  That's akin to saying that a chain letter is an attack on the banking industry because bank statements come in the mail.  And Dan points out a more valid thing to consider - a terrorist isn't going to attack a tariff desk, market system, or security coordinator; they will attack nuclear units, substations, and other installations that actually matter.     I echo Dave's question - do we want to ""call"" NERC on this issue?  It would be a very simple exercise to point to NERC's many security failings, including some initiatives they are currently sitting on.  Bringing up the right details in the right forums could really undermine their reputation and nip this positioning in the bud.  (By the way - am I the only one who got a kick out of that article pointing out this 3rd grade cleverness of ""NIMDA is ADMIN spelled backwards""?  Gotta love journalists - always trying to find an angle.  Next they'll say that the 60 in ""2600"" refers to the frequency of the interconnection!)

The statements concern NERC's view of the implications of terrorist threats for FERC's "" Four RTO policy"" set forth in its July 12th Order.  The statements also may bear upon the effort to establish a new standards setting organization, particularly the possibility that NERC's responsibilities could be shifted to EISB.  Also attached is an article containing the views of R.J. Rudden Associates, Inc. that discusses the risks associated with centralizing control center operations.  Specifically, NERC representatives informed the press that on September 11 ""the grid was the target of an insidious cyber attack that shut down some facilities...from an information administration standpoint.""  They noted that this resulted in service denials, although it is not clear whether they indicated where or how much.  This event was attributed to the so-called ""NIMBA virus"".  NERC's statements suggest a new strategy to preserve the role they've played not only in security matters, but possibly other aspects pertaining to ""reliability standards.""  They warn against any immediate transition to fewer RTOs as envisioned in FERC's July 12th Order.  Moreover, it is likely that NERC will argue that, given its expertise and experience, recent events make transitioning to a new standards organization (EISB?) ill advised.    It is unclear what, if any, impact all this may have on RTO development, the legislative effort to establish a new reliability standards body or the NERC Board's consideration of pending reform proposals at its October meeting.  However, we can expect security related issues to be included in future discussions of these matters.

"FYI  Today's FERC meeting was a big deal.   Some of the key actions are:  DSTAR and RTO West are to be ""married,""  The FERC wants a single western RTO but will wait on making CAISO merge with other western RTOs so that California can ""heal its wounds.""  Every utility needs to declare which RTO it plans to join by 12/1/01 (or possibly 12/15; not sure of date).  Otherwise the utility will lose market-based rates, will be unable to get a merger approved, and will have its transmission rev req. scrutinized. The commission favors 1 market structure applied to the four nationwide RTOs.   It plans on holding a week of workshops and issuing a NOPR to determine this structure.  The goal is to essentially re-issue the Order 888 tariff in a form that encompases the new functions of RTOs.  Although consistent business rules applied to large geographic markets are a good thing, expect this new effort and redefining the RTO to delay ultimate implementation. Although California will be allowed to heal, it is ordering an operational audit of the Calfornia ISO. Separately the FERC indicated the plan to issue a NOPR on market power and market based rates.   Expect new rules and procedure to determine whether a market is sufficiently competitive to allow for market based rates.  Further summary, prepared by Sarah Novosel in our Govt. Affairs DC office, is provided bel  o   w    The Commission held its first open meeting with Pat Wood as the new Chairman today and discussed many interesting issues.  The following is a summary of the meeting.  The meeting is still going on, and we will provide an addendum to this email updating you on what was discussed this afternoon (regarding market power).  RTOs   Chairman Wood expressed his desire to finish the RTO transition, and that the Commission needs to provide guidance and leadership in order to speed up the RTO transition.  Chairman Wood considers the RTO effort on two tracks:  1) organizational -- what will the RTO organizations look like, and 2) substantive -- once you set up the organizations, what will they do.  Organizational Effort:  Wood stated that this effort has already begun with the July 12 orders and the Northeast and Southeast mediation efforts.  The Commission will be issuing additional orders in the northeast, southeast and Midwest within the next couple of FERC meetings.  Wood also stated that it is time for RTO West and Desert Star to ""marry up,"" meaning, I suppose, that the two should consolidate.  Wood does not think that California can be included in the western RTO yet since it has lingering problems.  Structural Effort:  The Commission will initiate a section 206 proceeding to address market design and structure issues in order to translate the 8 functions established in Order No. 2000 into RTO structures.  To achieve this goal, the Commission is establishing an ""RTO week"" of advanced workshops, from October 15-19, in advance of issuing a NOPR, to address structural issues such as:  congestion management; cost recovery; market monitoring; transmission planning; reliability; transmission rights.  Wood also envisions that the Commission will develop a new pro forma tariff to replace the existing Order No. 888 transmission tariff.  The new tariff will apply to all public utilities and RTOs.  Wood also recognized that some ""sticks"" are needed to entice RTO participation.  Therefore, Wood proposes to have all public utilities come in by December 15, 2001 with a declaration to join an RTO.  If they do not make this declaration, these entities will have their market based rate authority revoked on a prospective basis.  Furthermore, Wood states that if entities do not join RTOs, they should not be authorized to merge their facilities, and that FERC will also look at their rates to determine whether they are still just and reasonable rates compared with rates offered by RTOs.  Wood states that these ""sticks"" provide incentive, but do not mandate, RTO participation.  With regard to the pending requests for rehearing, Wood asked legal staff to figure out how ""FERC can get there.""  In other words, I think Wood is telling them to develop the legal analysis for denying rehearing.  While Commissioner Breathitt is skeptical about some of these RTO proposals, because she was not required to vote on anything today, she only expressed her concern.  Upcoming Dates   October 15-19 -- RTO Workshops  End of October -- further orders on Northeast, Southeast, Midwest RTOs  December 15, 2001 -- all public utilities must commit to an RTO or have their market based rates revoked   Proposed Rule for Standards of Conduct  Within the next few days, FERC will be issuing a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (""NOPR"") on standards of conduct for transmission providers.  As explained at the meeting (we do not have a copy of the NOPR yet), the NOPR will propose to apply standards of conduct uniformly to electric transmission providers and gas pipeline transportation providers similarly.  The NOPR also proposes to broaden the definition of affiliate to include all energy affiliates, not just marketers.

The contracts being negotiated with PDVSA have enough protections for no= n-delivery of gas. As you probably already know, PDVSA has an option to bec= ome a partner in the venture and now we might have this entity and not PDVS= A as a partner, which might be an issue when making cash calls, if the even= t happens. I presume that will be taken care in the JV agreement since this=  is standard practice: in the event of cash calls, for example for an expan= sion, the partner not contributing the cash would be diluted. Of course, we=  would prefer to have PDVSA as a partner because we see them financially mo= re solid. In any event, both are state-owned and both would be responding t= o the same policies set by the MEM.  If things are done the right way, there would be a complete separation betw= een the gas and the oil industry and this would be good for us. To make a f= inal assessment, however, we need a significant amount of information that = is not available yet. We need that information to answer questions such as:=  Who will be the owner of the gas associated with oil production? If it is = the new entity (otherwise it would not make a lot of sense making the separ= ation), then PDVSA's E&P would be required to buy gas at the tariffs set by=  the MEM. If there is a buyer who is willing to pay a higher price, then th= e new entity will make the case that it prefers to sell to that entity. Mor= eover, PDVSA E&P would need to make clear how much gas it needs to sign the=  appropriate contracts, which will force an increase in the efficiency of t= he gas it uses, hopefully increasing the transparency of the sector. Right = now, PDVSA E&P buys gas at a transfer price set internally, probably at pri= ces significantly lower than the tariff. PDVSA E&P is the largest user of g= as in the country, accounting for more than half the consumption.=20  Another question is how the gas owned by the new entity will be priced (if = non-associated gas is priced differently from associated gas)? Will it have=  the autonomy to sign contracts (of course with the blessing of the MEM)? W= ill the terms already negotiated with the Jose LNG be accepted? How much po= litical intervention will the new entity have? Who will stay?=20  So far the only people that have taken actions against the split are the em= ployees themselves because they are concerned about the benefits they enjoy= . There has been some strikes and demonstrations due to the separation.  The main benefit that I see is that it will make the price for E&P explicit= , because we are dealing with two separate companies, and will allow other = parties to search for gas (or its replacement such as Nitrogen, which under=  current plants would be three times the size of our project) and sign cont= racts with PDVSA E&P if that is cheaper. All this assumes an economic ratio= nality that we have not seen in the sector, and therefore nothing might cha= nge. I'll keep you posted with any other developments.

Stephen  09/27 17:25 Venezuela to Create Separate Government Gas Company By Patrick Gordon Caracas, Sept. 27 (Bloomberg) -- Venezuela's Energy and Mines Ministry plan= s to create a state-owned gas company as the country begins a campaign to boost natural gas production. The new company will replace PDVSA Gas, a subsidiary of the state oil company Petroleos de Venezuela SA now in charge of the gas industry, said Luis Vierma, director policy and planning for the Energy and Mines Ministry= . ``Until now gas has always been placed in line behind oil at PDVSA,'' said Vierma. ``We need a company that will focus on gas.'' He added that the as yet unnamed company will start operations before the end of the year. Venezuela has about 147 trillion cubic feet of natural gas reserves, the largest in Latin America and the seventh largest in the world= . Venezuela produced 3.42 billion cubic feet of gas in 2000, compared with 3.= 5 billion a year earlier. The new company is being created as the South American country has increase= d its emphasis on natural gas production. Venezuela sold rights to six natural gas tracts in June, the first time since it nationalized the oil and gas industry in 1975- 1976 that private companies could participate in the exploration and production of natural gas. Critics said the removing natural gas production from PDVSA would be inefficient and increase costs. ``It doesn't make any sense to separate the two businesses,'' said Luis Giusti, former PDVSA president who is now a senior adviser for the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. ``Gas is usually found with oil. That's why it's called the oil and gas industry,'' said Giusti. Venezuela and private companies may invest up to $50 billion over the next 30 years to develop Venezuela's 100 trillion cubic feet of probable offshor= e gas reserves, he said. Exploratory drilling for gas would begin Dec. 15 at the Deltana Platform of= f the eastern coast, said Vierma. Natural gas for November delivery rose 37.1 cents, or 16 percent, to $2.62 per million British thermal units on the New York Mercantile Exchange.  ?2001 Bloomberg L.P. All rights reserved.

"Hello! Rick,  Yesterday, we received a call from the AMEE ( Mexican Association of Electric Power), where Ricardo is the Vice-president of de-regulation and open access, regarding to the six-month?s payment to the AMEE. This payment is for $900 dollars or $9000 pesos.   I just wanted to ask you if we should continue or not our relationship with the AMEE. Last Friday we were invited by the AMME to a working breakfast with Senator Genaro Borrego, where he explained to us his proposal related to the energy sector reform.    Below you will find a brief description of the AMEE. The AMEE was created on February of 1999, after President Ernesto Zedillo sent an initiative to Congress for the restructuring of the Electric Industry. From that moment the intention of the AMEE has been to actively participate in the discussions and of course in the opening of the electric market for the private investment.   This association allows the participation of all of the members of the industry that have interest in promoting the AMEE?s ideas and are willing to contribute with their ideas to the opening of the energy industry. The AMEE is an organism that has had access to privilege information for its analyses from the government authorities and the Congress. In fact, the AMEE is negotiating the best conditions for the opening and de-regulation of the market with them. The AMEE has work teams with the CFE, the CRE (regulatory entity), Pemex, the Secretariat of Energy and with the National Commission for energy savings.  The AMEE has organized working breakfasts with members of the Congress, and co-organizing events like the Power-Mex 2001, co-generation seminars and specialized conferences related to the energy area, etc.  Regards,  Kikumi ",richard.shapiro@enron.com,kikumi.kishigami@enron.com,Six-month's payment AMEE,2001-10-02 19:20:42-07:00,received
" As you know, the Commission last week issued several important notices and papers regarding various policy initiatives that the Commission plans to address over the next few months.  These issues are extremely important to Enron and we have been urging FERC to address and resolve (most) of these issues for many years.  There is now a Commission in charge that looks like it is ready to act, and we need to be ready to respond.    In an effort to coordinate our efforts, we have developed coverage teams to respond to these FERC initiatives.  The Washington advocacy group will also work closely with all of these teams.  If someone is interested in a particular issue and was not included on that team, please feel free to call the Project Lead to have your name added to the team.  All assistance is welcome.  As you will see on the attached chart, many of the deadlines for responding to these initiatives are within the next few weeks, so the teams need to mobilize and establish a game plan for our responses very quickly.  On the attached chart, we have listed in the left column each of the FERC initiatives that will be starting or are currently underway.  A ""Project Lead"" has been named for each initiative.  The Project Lead will be responsible for developing and initiating a game plan for how Enron will respond in the proceeding.  The Team Lead will be contacting each of you within the next couple of days to set up processes and procedures for moving forward.  The team will be responsible for the initial determination of what issues should be addressed, what is the best way for Enron to respond to them, and producing draft comments.  Once draft comments are prepared, the comments will be circulated to a much wider group of Government Affairs and commercial people to ensure that the team has captured all of Enron's important issues.    There is a column of ""Inside Counsel"" and ""Outside Services.""  In some areas, we plan to use outside counsel or consultants and in others we do not.  Where we do not list outside counsel, we will rely on our inside counsel to draft the comments (with significant input from the team members).  Please remember, however, that even if outside services are listed, the RCR process must still be followed.  If applicable, Project Leads should submit the necessary RCR request as soon as possible. The following is a brief description of each proceeding and the Project Lead named for each proceeding:  RTO Meetings and Comments to NOPR:  Sarah Novosel and Christi Nicolay will be the Project Leads in this proceeding.  The RTO meetings will be held in Washington from October 15-19, and we hope to have an executive from Enron make a presentation on one of the panels.  Comments will be submitted to FERC regarding the appropriate market design for RTOs.  This team will also be responsible for these comments.  Standards of Conduct NOPR:  Lisa Yoho will be the Project Lead.  Comments are due in approximately 45 days.  Several issues are raised in this proceeding, including a proposal to apply the standards of conduct to a utility's marketing affiliate buying and selling power to serve native load.  This is a significant action for FERC and we will strongly encourage the Commission to adopt this bold proposal.  ICAP Inquiry:  Christi Nicolay will be the Project Lead.  Chairman Wood has indicated that he is not very familiar with capacity and reserve requirements, whether they are needed, and what impact such requirements have on the market.  Enron has been a strong opponent of ICAP for many years, and we plan to show FERC that ICAP requirements are not needed.  We will submit expert testimony on this issue. California Audit and Westwide Price Cap Mitigation:  Alan Comnes will be the Project Lead.  Commissioner Brownell is leading a FERC audit of the California ISO.  Although we do not have details of what the audit is intended to cover or how expansive it will be, we need to carefully monitor this proceeding and have input into the audit process where possible.  Furthermore, a request for rehearing is pending before the Commission regarding the current price cap mitigation measures.  The Commission implemented these caps in an effort to limit price spikes in California.  California's summer peaking season is over, but the Pacific Northwest's winter peaking season will be starting soon, and the mitigation measures currently in effect could discourage power sellers from selling power to the Northwest, where it will be needed this winter.  This team will be responsible for both of these proceedings. Transmission Constraint and Energy Infrastructure Issues:  Steve Walton is the Project Lead.  FERC staff is studying two significant transmission constraints - California's Path 15 and the Central East Interface in New York  -- and plans to have the study completed later this year.  The Commission plans to forward the study to DOE.  The Commission stated that this is a high priority for it.  In a relating proceeding, the Commission has stated that it will hold four open meetings in different regions of the country to identify energy infrastructure issues.  The team will also oversee the progress in these proceedings. Revised Public Utility Filing Requirements:  Susan Lindberg is the Project Lead.  The Commission has issued a NOPR proposing to require market participants to provide more information than is currently required, including at least seven additional data points per transaction.  This will have a significant administrative burden on Enron and could require the disclosure of commercially sensitive information.  Comments are due on October 5. California Refund Proceeding:  Ray Alvarez is the Project Lead.  The Commission has ordered power sellers to pay refunds for sales made to the California ISO from October 2, 2000 through June 20, 2001, and has established a hearing proceeding to resolve issues of material fact.   Pacific Northwest Refund Proceeding:  Bob Frank is the Project Lead.  The Judge in this proceeding issued an initial decision recently finding that refunds are not warranted in the Pacific Northwest.  Briefs will be filed in response to the decision, and the Commission will review the Judge's order.   Midwest/Alliance RTO Proceeding:  Mike Roan is the Project Lead.  Various filings are pending before the Commission regarding establishment of two RTOs in the Midwest - the Alliance RTO and the Midwest RTO.  Enron is advocating, consistent with the Commission's recent pronouncements, one single RTO in the Midwest.  The Commission is expected to act on these filings shortly.  Proceedings may be ordered. Northeast RTO Proceeding:  Sarah Novosel is the Project Lead.  Mediation to create a single Northeast RTO has concluded and the Judge's report is pending before the Commission.  A Commission order is expected on or before October 31.  Additional proceedings may be ordered. Southeast RTO Proceeding:  Christi Nicolay is the Project Lead.  Mediation to create a single Southeast RTO has concluded and the Judge's report is pending before the Commission.  A Commission order is expected on or before October 31.  Additional proceedings may be ordered.

The statements concern NERC's view of the implications of terrorist threats for FERC's "" Four RTO policy"" set forth in its July 12th Order.  The statements also may bear upon the effort to establish a new standards setting organization, particularly the possibility that NERC's responsibilities could be shifted to EISB.  Also attached is an article containing the views of R.J. Rudden Associates, Inc. that discusses the risks associated with centralizing control center operations.  Specifically, NERC representatives informed the press that on September 11 ""the grid was the target of an insidious cyber attack that shut down some facilities...from an information administration standpoint.""  They noted that this resulted in service denials, although it is not clear whether they indicated where or how much.  This event was attributed to the so-called ""NIMBA virus"".  NERC's statements suggest a new strategy to preserve the role they've played not only in security matters, but possibly other aspects pertaining to ""reliability standards.""  They warn against any immediate transition to fewer RTOs as envisioned in FERC's July 12th Order.  Moreover, it is likely that NERC will argue that, given its expertise and experience, recent events make transitioning to a new standards organization (EISB?) ill advised.  It is unclear what, if any, impact all this may have on RTO development, the legislative effort to establish a new reliability standards body or the NERC Board's consideration of pending reform proposals at its October meeting.  However, we can expect security related issues to be included in future discussions of these matters.

However, if we are to maintain growth levels, we need to focus very closely on our cost base and create more efficiencies in the current round of Enron Corp. budget reviews.  We are analysing much more closely exactly which businesses we derive our earnings from and concentrating our resources on those areas.  We will be taking decisions to put some projects on the ""back burner""and reduce the scope of others.  This will inevitably mean that we need to reduce our headcount both in commercial and commercial support groups as we seek to identify the best mix of skills to keep us on our earnings growth track.  To this end we will be seeking to cut our headcount in Europe by between five and ten percent, but we will aim as far as possible to achieve this through a program of voluntary severance.  Details of this program will be made available by Monday 8th October.  We hope to complete this exercise and communicate the outcome as quickly as possible in October so that everyone knows where they stand.  Please feel free to contact either of us, but also talk to your supervisor about any specific concerns you may have and remember that you can also make use of the LifeWorks confidential counselling service that is available on 0800 169 1920.  We firmly believe that if we work hard together now to achieve these short term goals, we will create a stronger, more flexible team at Enron which will be better placed than ever to grow our business in Europe.

Los cuales se los voya enviar a Rick, pero antes de eso quisiera ver tus comentarios al respecto.  Saludos y que tengas buen viaje a M?xico.  Kikumi   ___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Hello! Rick,  Last week I went to a working breakfast with Senator Genaro Borrego (PRI), where presented his proposal to reform the electric sector.  In his speech he mentioned neither any political party nor the secretary of energy have a definitive model as up today. To solve this situation he has proposed to the other political parties to get together in order to reach a consensus and elaborate a proposal for Congress. So, when this proposal arrives to Congress, it will be quickly approved and will not have the same problems like the fiscal reform, that has not been approved yet. He wants a political reform that is viable.     He started his speech with two questions: 1.- A reform? for what? 2.- Why do we need a reform?  His answers to the first question were: - to ensure the electricity supply in the long term  - Competitive tariffs for the industrial sector - Socially equal residential tariffs. Residential tariffs have an important subsidy that has to be well allocated. Right now the Government is subsiding to whom more     consumes. And this year the total amount of subsidies has reached to $5 billion dollars. This amount has to decrease and be distributed in an appropriate way.  And for the second: - The power sector requires a high level of investment, and the sector does not generate the sufficient resources.  Investment must be public and private. - The lack of investment in the sector has resulted in a serious decline in operational capacity reserves. - CFE performance is inadequate and needs to be an autonomous organism. - The IPP and Pidiregas models have came to an end and they have left an enormous debt to the Government of Mexico.  - The rapid electricity demand growth     In 1999 President Ernesto Zedillo sent an initiative to Congress for the restructuring of the Electric Industry.  This initiative, which proposed the sale of assets was heavily opposed  by unions and left wing parties. The initiative requires a Constitutional amendment which has to be passed with a qualified majority of at least 66.6 % of the votes.    Due to the background of this initiative and the actual composition of Congress, where non of the parties have the majority, his proposal and model is focused in making an amendment to law instead of Constitution. His proposal is based on art. 1 of the Public Service of Electric Power Law, where it mentions that ""It corresponds exclusively to the nation, the generation, the transformation, the distribution and the supply of electric power that has for objective the benefit of the public service"". So, the electric power which its goal is to be a productive input will not be considered as a public service. So, the electricity generated under this purpose will be opened and traded in an open market.   Generation   - 60% private sector and CFE?s subsidiary  (CFE will establish a company where CFE will have the majority, 51%,     Wholesale market        and the rest of the company's common, 49%, will be for sale to              private investment). Its goal is to promote competition. This company, will be capitalized           through the AFOREs (retirement money). In order to use these resources, it will be           necessary to do some changes in the legal system.)       - 40% public service.    To guarantee supply for residential and agriculture sectors.  In case of a failure of the market, CFE will back up the market, and will charge for it.    Transmission: All the participants of the market will pay a fee to CFE (decentralized) for using the network.  Transmission will remain in the  hands of the state. Distribution:  Unbundling and corporatizing distribution and setting up 13 regional distribution companies. These regional companies will have the same     composition, 51% under the hands of the State and the rest will be opened to private sector. In the long term these companies will be     concessions. The concession of these companies will happen after and if in the year 2003 the conditions within Congress are more favorable to send    a Constitutional amendment.  CENACE will be responsible for the system operation (dispatch) as an autonomous public organism. To promote transparency and the correct incentives to the market.  He also mentioned that this model does not represent the final model of his party (PRI), because inside the same PRI there is specially one Senator, Manuel Barlett, whose ideas are totally opposed of looking into a reform in the energy sector.

"Pacific NW Lawmakers Gear Up To Oppose FERC RTO Mandate By Bryan Lee  10/04/2001 Dow Jones Energy Service (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)  OF DOW JONES NEWSWIRES   WASHINGTON -(Dow Jones)- Members of the Pacific Northwest congressional delegation are gearing up in opposition to the U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's mandate for consolidation of power-grid assets in the region. The House Northwest Energy Caucus held an informal hearing late Wednesday to air concerns of utilities and industrial consumers in the region about FERC's effort to establish a regional transmission organization, or RTO.  The lawmakers plan to follow up the hearing with a letter to FERC voicing the concerns, which largely revolve around skepticism that the RTO will result in cost savings for the region's consumers.  FERC shouldn't force an RTO on the region without first conducting a cost-benefit analysis, said Rep. Peter DeFazio, D-Ore., who is spearheading the effort.  Speaking with reporters prior to Wednesday's hearing, DeFazio complained that ""a bunch of bureaucrats"" at FERC are embracing the national power-grid agenda of Enron Corp. (ENE) without assessing the costs and regardless of ""what it does for local reliability.""  DeFazio's complaints were echoed in the testimony presented at Wednesday's hearing.  The region already enjoys an open and competitive transmission network, thanks to the federally owned Bonneville Power Administration, according to hearing testimony expressing concern that RTO West, as the RTO proposed for the region is called, will cost more to implement than it will provide in benefits.  ""We are troubled that RTO West will not achieve any net benefit for end-use consumers in the Northwest,"" the Public Power Council testified. ""Although work is beginning on a cost-benefit study, we are troubled that a transmission system that has served us all well for so long will be disassembled because FERC has announced that RTOs, by definition, are good.""  ""Regional transmission organizations may be necessary to remedy the transmission ills in other regions of the country, but not in the Northwest,"" declared a group of transmission-dependent utilities.  ""The 'balkanization' and isolation of transmission systems that characterize most other regions is simply not present in the Northwest. For this reason, the economic power-side benefits of an RTO will be relatively small,"" said a group of aluminum producers.  Similar cost-benefit concerns have been voiced by state utility regulators in the Eastern U.S. who oppose FERC's effort to consolidate grid assets under large RTOs in the Southeast and Northeast.  'RTO Week'   FERC Chairman Pat Wood III acknowledged the complaints Thursday, adding that he expected to address the concerns of regulators and industry during ""RTO Week"" Oct. 15, when the commission will hold five days of hearings on the commission's RTO mandate.  ""I think I need the decisionmakers at the table. We've had the lawyers in the suits arguing about it for eight years now,"" Wood said at an ""energy community"" forum sponsored by Enron in Arlington, Va.  Wood told Dow Jones Newswires following his remarks at the Enron forum that FERC answered the complaints about the lack of a cost-benefit analysis at its Sept. 26 meeting.  The commission agreed to undertake a comprehensive analysis in support of its claim that RTOs will bring about operational efficiencies that will translate into consumer savings.  Wood also noted a study by Mirant Corp. (MIR), which concluded that combining the three independent system operators in the Northeast into a single RTO would produce $440 million in annual consumer benefits.  During the Enron forum, Edward Meyers, a regulator with the District of Columbia Public Service Commission, urged Wood to seek out the input of affected state regulators.  Meyers noted that he is in the minority among regulators in the region in supporting the Northeast RTO grid-consolidation, while most others oppose the effort as ""economically dangerous.""  Arnetta McRae, chairman of the Delaware Public Service Commission, told Wood that her fellow state regulators aren't so much opposed to grid regionalization but the lack of consultation by FERC.  The state regulators want ""an opportunity to be at the table,"" McRae said. If such a process were offered, there would be a lot less opposition, she predicted.  FERC is reaching out to address the concerns of state regulators, Wood said, adding that he was ""blindsided"" by the opposition among state regulators to FERC's grid-consolidation mandate.  Later in the day, Wood told reporters that ""RTO Week"" will feature an entire hearing devoted to the concerns of state regulators.  At the Enron forum, Wood defended the commission's RTO policy, which calls for carving up the nation's interconnected electricity system under the control of four or five large RTOs, as necessary to jump-start the overly long transition from regulation to competition.  ""This process needs to be goosed,"" said Wood, calling FERC's RTO orders ""an external catalyst"" to get the process moving.  ""If I'm wrong, I'd love to find a better way around that,"" he said.  -By Bryan Lee, Dow Jones Newswires; 202-862-6647; Bryan.Lee@dowjones.com  Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Currently, the allocations in question are being applied to Regulatory Affairs Europe (RA).  I received a message from Greg McMahon regarding the Environment and the Environmental Policy and Compliance cost centers' distribution to RA, but also would like to address the issue of the allocation from my cost center, Managing Dir Gov't Affairs, to RA.  I think all of these cost allocations should be at the Enron Europe level as a company, rather than distributed to the RA group.  Regarding the Environmental groups' allocations - these activities are on behalf of the business units' activities, not on behalf of RA. At least part of the activities are global in nature, and not even attributable to specific regions or countries within Europe. Regarding the Mng Dir Gov't Affairs allocation - these costs reflect a portion of the activity in our DC office with federal legislators and agencies, again on behalf of the business units' activities, not on behalf of RA.  Another issue with the distribution of these costs to RA is the circle created when you allocate to a budget that then gets allocated.  Please let me know your thoughts on this issue.

Rick and I spoke yesterday about this, and we agreed that the EHS charges, as well as the small amount of Corp Gov't Affairs that's allocated to Europe, are more appropriately applied at the business unit level, as it's not the Regulatory Affairs group that actually receives the services.  Additionally, the Regulatory Affairs Europe charges are applied back to the business unit anyway, so it's rather like burying allocations within another allocation.  I've left a message for Mark Lindsey in the Corp. Finance group to find out who we need to talk to in Europe about this issue.  If you have any suggestion as to who would be best to talk to about this I'd appreciate that as well.

I think we need to re-visit the issue, you were a great help last year and I think we understand the allocations more than we ever did.  I've attached the spreadsheet we received and have pulled our figures from. I think it is from Dawn Derr.   << File: Corp Allocations.xls >>  Paul has asked me to write the email in the hope that between us all we can agree if the charges are valid or can be reduced/removed.  Alan I have copied you in as Paul mentioned you were the most appropriate EHS person and if Reg Affairs don't take the charges perhaps your department (Asset Management) can.   These are the EHS charges Reg Affairs are down to take at the moment. From the spreadsheet I could work out that we are paying for 10% Environment and 4% of Policy and Compliance total budgets.  The costs are not large but we are being made to explain all Corporate Allocations to our COO this year in length as to the value we get and what we use it for.                 % of 2002 budget  2002   2001  Government Affairs Environment   10%   $86k   $70k Susan Warthen   Environmental Policy & Compliance     4%   $27k   $76k Jeffrey Keeler Total         $113k   $146k   Rick / Paul / Alan I'd appreciate any comments from you as well as Stephen is expecting me to reach a resolution on this. Thanks a lot. Greg  Here is the description I have of each of the two areas in 2001. (I think I received them both from you.)       Environment My group's support services are more global in nature, rather than providing services to any one unit.  Services include the administration of the corporate EHS web site and regulatory subcsriptions, risk assessment of acquisitions, divestitures  & major capital projects, corprate responsibility initiatives, & performance reporting.  I divided the business unit allocations based on 2001 business growth, maturity of their EHS management systems, and historical use.  Environmental Policy and Compliance Allocation to Enron Europe reflects an estimated 7.5% use of our group's time for FY2001 (revised dollar amount of $75,965).    As directed by Mike Terraso and Steve Kean, we expect to increase our commercial support focus in 2001 towards European and other international wholesale and retail markets, and will be hiring additional staff to focus in this area.   We expect our current North American activities to expand to Europe and other global markets, including:  Providing competitive intelligence (timely information and analysis) to commercial units based on environmental policy/regulation in Europe and worldwide.  Assist commercial groups with analysis of impacts on business and identify business opportunities related to environmental policies.  Subjects include: Global Climate Change -- carbon dioxide/greenhouse gas emission regulation Air quality regulation -- SO2/Acid Rain, NOx, mercury, particulate matter Renewable Energy & Energy Efficiency - renewable mandates, credit/offset trading, environmental disclosure/labeling Industrial/Global Markets - environmental issues facing new Enron markets, i.e. pulp & paper, steel, or existing markets, i.e emissions, coal, weather.  Coordinate advocacy on environmental policy issues worldwide, working closely with government affairs & public affairs units.

We have the potential to add as much value via GovRegAffairs activity on the  continent in the next 12 months as through any commercial activity.  Much of this activity will have to be EU focused.  In  power especially we have gotten almost - not quite all - but almost all that we can hope to get exclusively from national   level work.  (Italy and Spain are of course big exceptions.)  Gas is and always has been much more of a Europe-wide  theme than a national theme.  We will have to carefully manage our public GRA message and approach to take tough  positions without creating unneeded enemies.  We should look for local national allies where possible.  We cannot be the   only voice in any country supporting a major position.  If there are no local forces supporting the position, we need to  find/create some allies.  It cannot be Enron vs. Germany; or, even worse, Enron and EU vs Germany (or Switzerland, or  wherever).  Loss of momentum at this time would be an error; however, focus would be an accomplishment.  Each issue  will need a simultaneous AND co-ordinated EU and local effort.   1) Styles and the EU Office:  I am convinced that Peter Styles is the most important single continent based GRA asset at  this time and for the next 18 to 24 months.  Everyone including me has their own stories about Peter - not all positive.  But he is the right man, at the right time at the right place.  Within the bounds of what is managerially and financially  responsible, it is important to keep the Styles-force working for Enron at the EU level.  Beyond his linguistic skills he  understands absolutely what Enron needs to make money on the continent.  Of course, we should begin thinking about  Peter's EVENTUAL retirement.  We should never allow anyone to be permanently as essential as Peter has become.  BUT, right now he is essential.  2) German GRA Activities:  Permanent resource (100%) should become Jan Haizmann (or however you spell it).  He is  abrupt and offensive to Anglo-Saxons - but then, he is very German - and the directness that some of us have come to  appreciate about the Germans is often mistaken as rudeness by those who have not worked with them much.  I have gotten  consistently positive feed-back from senior German colleagues especially about his performance with senior German  officials such as the head of the Federal Cartel Office.  My understanding is that Haizmann wants to move to Frankfurt.  If  this is true, I would encourage it.  There are no German official offices (other than the Embassy) in London.   We have, I believe, all agreed that Paul Hennemeyer is more of a self-propelled project guy than a team player.  Thus, I   would agree that probably mid- to long-term he should move on within Enron to other Hennemeyer sized projects.  But,  in the immediate future, he has several very important projects going on in German speaking Europe.  Additionally, with  a new more profound emphasis on getting the gas market opened up, with renewed interest in Austria and with the   necessity to engage somewhat in Switzerland (regarding transit), it does not look to me like we should let Paul leave too  quickly.  As a somewhat mentor to Haizmann, passing off relationships in an orderly manner, ensuring that projects do not  fall through the cracks, etc. there is still much for Paul to do. It will be, however, necessary to give him a clear picture of  his future or Enron will lose him entirely.  An open ended ""project boy"" job will not keep Paul indefinitely.  Let's not lose  Paul to Enron even if we have to slowly move him out of Europe.  3) Lars Atenhoefer:  Lars is much in demand by Gregor and others for his unique brand of consulting based commercial work.  I continue to believe that he would be a very powerful less than 50% GRA front-end for Switzerland.  He would be glad to  do that but for the next time will clearly keep his commercial focus.  Switzerland does not/will not justify full-time GRA  support; but, we must get more engaged there.  Less for our Swiss business than for our cross-border business and for  continued grid and water power access.  The liberalisation vote next year will fail if it is held. Everything going on in  Switzerland now by real players is based on the failure of that vote. Important to work with Gregor and Eric to ensure that  Lars continues to see a variety of opportunities in Enron.  His academic and professional preparation is perfect for a GRA  person.  He belongs to Gregor and Eric.  I recommend talking with them about him.  4) Doug Wood:  I do not see a mid- or long-term role for Doug Wood on the continent.  He only speaks English and currently  has little feel for the continent - which is neither American nor Britain.  English only players will ALWAYS fall behind  locals.  In every country where we need to have an impact, the impact MUST be in local language and should be with a  local national.  GRA work is political (i.e., irrational and emotional). Brits are Europeans and Americans are people too   doesn't wash with local politicians.  The fact that some locals are willing to speak English is a trick.  The real business -  particularly regulatory and political business - is always done in local language.  Local GRA people, local country   managers, local lawyers, etc. are not going to suffer an English only player gladly.  Let's be realistic about this.  Doug  Wood has no future on the continent.  5) Research Specialists (and other such creatures):  We should not have such creatures.  That is a go nowhere job and it  attracts go nowhere people.  More seriously, it would be a fantastic place for a direct out of the university eager Analyst  to get an introduction to Enron before hitting a commercial desk.  That will also help ensure that future commercial teams  will better understand the role of GRA.  The continuity argument doesn't wash.  Many commercial Analyst and Associates  rotate leaving continuity problems behind.  I am getting rid of my personal Research Specialist and will farm the work out  in the future to rotating Analysts (watch out Gregor and Eric).  Reg Affairs should get rid of all of their Research Positions.   We must ensure that enough first rotation Analysts are assigned to this task. I have several times in several different   countries seen Analyst level work outsourced to very highly paid consultants simply because GRA didn't have any  resource.  Besides being expensive and wasteful, this costs a would be Analyst a great learning experience.  Perhaps  each commercial country manager and each country specific GRA person should share a research analyst as a first  round rotator.  All of our senior relationship work, etc. would be done much more professionally if that were the case and  our consulting bills would fall.  6) Country Managers:  Each country manager (such as Radmacher, Renggli, a hopefully soon to be new Italian one, etc.)  should be spending a meaningful (ca. 10 to 15%) of their time on GRA activities.  The commercial country manager should  by definition have the best feel in Enron for what we need to do how and with whom in his/her country.  They must be told  that GRA leadership - together with you and the gas and power leadership executives - is part of their job. A new market  manager such as the future Italian country manager should consider GRA leadership an essential part of getting their  market off of the ground.  Any commercial country manager who wants to 100% outsource GRA leadership in his/her  country should be replaced.  Further, this should also reduce the need for too many VP and Sr Director level GRA people  at this time.  7) Italy:  A Spaniard that speaks Italian is a good SHORT-term solution for Italy.  If we successfully hire a new Italian country  manager, he should get heavily involved in this initially.  Eventually, we will need a real-live Italian in Italy but we probably   don't need to look for him/her this quarter.    8) Local Politics, Local Language, Local National:  Should apply to:  Germany, The Netherlands, Austria/Switzerland  (perhaps together, but then done by a German), France(&, perhaps Belgium), Spain, Italy.  I cannot imagine that we need any   resource in former Communist Europe - Poland, Czech Republic, Hungary, Slovak Republic, etc.    I have a lot of much more minor thoughts and suggestions; but, I am going to make this my final and conclusive list of GRA suggestions.  I look forward to working with you in this regard.  Already have engagements in the GRA space in Switzerland and Germany this year and am sure that there are many to come. Congratulations in you new role and best of wishes.  JT",richard.shapiro@enron.com,paul.dawson@enron.com,FW: PERSONAL & CONFIDENTIAL - My Last Thoughts on GRA,2001-10-08 01:16:27-07:00,received

"I have a conference call w/ Jim Fallon on Wednesday and w/ Paul Racicot, Tuesday afternoon (4 p.m. c.d.t.)  I wanted to touch base w/ you on a few issues, before I speak to Jim.  Talk to you tomorrow.  1.  My plan at this point is to continue activity through the end of 2001, assuming no continued funding in 2002. 2.  Need to discuss a graceful exit strategy in DC with legislators and FCC.  (Not sure if there are any plans for any news release relative to EBS, but would want to coordinate a release with meetings in DC) 3.  Continuing to monitor legislation (including Economic Stimulus Bill (Upton Bill)) which includes accelerated depreciation of investments and tax credits for new investment.  Currently doesn't include anything on unbundling, a la Tauzin-Dingel, but we continue to monitor. 4.  Low likelihood of other legislation being passed out of Congress this year dealing with telecom.  We have been laying low in our coalition efforts with other Houston energy companies (i.e. El Paso and Dynegy). 5.  Venable, a law firm in DC, that is representing Verizon, is interested in Enron's participation in its coalition.  We haven't been able to find common ground on issues.  However, last approach indicated that Verizon views Enron's participation as having cache.  I would suggest approaching commercial folks to see if they think they can utilize the leverage of us joining the coalition in exchange for some commercial deal w/ Verizon.  Probably a long-shot, but maybe worth a look.  Problem here is Venable wants to use Enron's name in a public way around DC with lawmakers.  If we have exiting on our minds, doesn't make sense to make a big splash.   6.  SBC has filed for non-dominant status at the FCC for provision of advanced services.  Has the effect of removing SBC from regulatory oversight.  We are seeing what Comptel is doing and determining whether we will join in with their filing or file separately. 7.  Telecommunications Industry Association (TIA) appears to be a new RBOC organization, filed a letter to the Bush Administration asking that access to advanced services not be provided to competitors on an unbundled basis.  Steve Burns has already met w/ Nancy Victory, Telecom Expert for the Administration, giving her the other side of the story.  This is another way of trying to get the Administration to weigh in on the issue. 8. 271 applications-3 BellSouth States (MS, LA, GA) have received state 271 authority, pending FCC review.  SBC has two application pending FCC review (AK and MO).  Qwest has announced its intent to file 7 or 8 applications by end of 1Q02.  We are not active at the state level. 9.  Interconnection agreements.  Hope to have majority of the agreements ready to file by November 01.  A few agreements, CO and NV, may take longer.  Thanks.

My only concern is that we should really try to go for a much shorter time period for Oregon.  I would think about 6 months.  After all, that is NWN's attraction.  Our goal should be to reach CLOSING in 9 months.  Paul, can you talk to Mark and make sure that Sue Ackerman is on board?  Thanks.   -----Original Message----- From:  Kaufman, Paul   Sent: Monday, October 08, 2001 6:38 PM To: Metts, Mark; Uhl, Jessica; Mordaunt, Kristina; Shapiro, Richard Subject: update  Three matters:  1. Conference call with Staff.  Particpants were:  Phil Nyegaard (staff lead for the Enron/PGE merger and currently acting chief of staff); Bryan Conway (lead staff electric techie and staff on the Sierra/PGE transaction); Mark Helman (Staff lead on PGE's rate case and the lead on the Sierra/PGE transaction); Lee Sparling (a lead on a number of gas company cases); and Bonnie Tatum (lead staff gas techie).  The call went well.  Staff was upbeat, interested, but (of course) non-commital.  They asked a number of questions--none of them troubling.     Timing.  They asked when we wanted a OPUC order.  Sue Ackerman suggested 9 months.  Pamela Lesh suggested that we would push for a shorter time frame.  Helman replied that we may be able to get this transaction done quicker, but this transaction presented different issues than past cases.  Helman asked suggested that we may need to propose conditions limiting anti-competitive gas vs. electric practices.   Financing.  Helman asked how NNG will finance the ($1.55 billion) cash portion of the purchse.   Ackerman responded that she would provide detail on the terms and conditions of the CSFB/Merrill financing.     Other Regulatory Review.  Helman asked whether the SEC would be reviewing the financial condition of the holding company.  We responded that the SEC would not be focusing on the financial condition of the holding company as it will be an exempt, intrastate.  I explained the other regulatory processes that would apply to the transaction.  Ackerman noted that the Washington Commission would review, but that we expected the issues to be limited.     Process.  Nyegaard noted that Mark D. and Peggy F. had met with the Commissioners.  He asked whether additional briefing would be necessary.  I responded that our discussions with the Commissioners had been brief and focused on the overall structure of the transaction and process.  I stated that we did not have any numbers at the time or other key details.  We said that we intended to seek a public meeting with the full commission (after our application is filed).  Staff supported a public meeting on the transaction.   They offered to join us in any future private meetings with the Commissioners (!!!!).  We said that we weren't planning any addition private meetings.    2. Other parties   Sue Ackerman spoke with Bob Jenks of CUB yesterday.  Her call followed our unsuccessful attempt to reach him via conference call.  Jenks was interviewed by the Oregonian for today's article.  He questioned NNG's ability to finance the purchase of a larger company.  In his private discussion with Sue, Jenks repeated his concern with NNG's ability to finance the transaction.  The only other concern he raised was NNG's practice of bringing regulatory issues to the legislature.     We were unable to reach ICNU and NWIGU--but left messages with Ken Cannon and Paula Pyron--respectively.  3. Rate Conditions.   We're still working on a variety of proposals for a rate condition.  At this time we are considering a proposal that would mirror NNG's ROE earnings test.   Under this approach, PGE would:  (1) compare actual distribution system related earnings to authorized earnings; (2) create an account which would track the difference between actual and authorized; (3) share a certain portion of the difference between actual and authorized--above 300 basis points.  The sharing would not take place until the next filed rate case.   Under this approach neither PGE nor NNG would commit to a rate freeze.  Parties could drag the utilities into the PUC through a show cause order--however, note that there have not been any show-cause rate cases at the OPUC in recent history.  Fuel savings (resulting from the merer of gas procurement activities) would flow through automatically to ratepayers through NNG's PGA and through PGE's PCA (of its progeny).     PGE is conducting an analysis of this mechanism to determine its impact on earnings.  We will discuss this mechanism with all of you before discussing it further with NNG.    4. FERC Review   We're pushing PGE and NNG to complete the data collection effort for CRA's market power analysis.  A revised schedule for the FERC, SEC, OPUC and WUTC proceedings will be circulated by mid-week.    --end--",j..kean@enron.com,richard.shapiro@enron.com,FW: update,2001-10-09 06:08:43-07:00,sent

Subject: Intellibridge has compiled the following report in response to yo ur request    10  October, 2001 To: James D. Steffes,  Enron From: Enron  Forum Content: Intellibridge has compiled the following report  in response to your request. Request: What  would be the amount of installed capacity of each of the FERC RTOs (assuming  Californiais ultimately in the  Western RTO) and what is the total peak demand in each  area?   Response:   Intellibridge estimates the following peak demand and installed capacity  figures for each of the four proposed FERC RTO regions based on the most recent  complete data available.  Peak load  data sets that were deemed complete and reliable are for 1999. Installed  capacity information is from forecasts made by NERC for 2001.   [IMAGE]    In response to FERC  Order 2000 of 6 January  2000, utilities throughout  the United  Statessubmitted proposals to  form Regional Transmission Organizations (RTOs) for coordinating and controlling  electric power grid systems in their area.   FERC responded to these proposals on 12 July 2001, in a series of orders  that made clear the Commission's vision of four large, regional RTOs making up  U.S. bulk power markets.  FERC said  in these orders, ""We favor the development of one RTO for the Northeast, one RTO  for the Midwest, one RTO for the Southeast, and one RTO for the  West.""   Though the eventual shape and scope of the regional RTOs remains in  question, estimates of capacity and peak demand can be made based on groupings  of North American Electricity Reliability Council (NERC) regional councils or  regional ISOs and bulk power markets.   For the purposes of estimating installed capacity and peak load in these  regions, the following groupings of NERC regional councils and ISOs were assumed  to correspond to the four RTOs proposed by  FERC:   Northeast: ?         PJM ?         ISO-New England ?         New York ISO   Southeast: ?         Southeastern Electric Reliability Council  (SERC) ?         Florida Reliability Coordinating Council  (FRCC)   Midwest: ?         Mid-Continent Area Power Pool (MAPP) ?         Mid-American Interconnected Network, Inc.  (MAIN) ?         Southwest Power Pool (SPP) ?         Eastern Central Area Reliability Coordination Agreement  (ECAR)   West ?         Western Systems Coordinating Council  (WSCC)   Peak Load  Data: FERC  Form 714 hourly load data were used to calculate coincidental peak load for the  Midwest and Southeast RTOs.  FERC's  most recent, complete set of Form 714 data are for year 1999; FERC is still  collecting data for year 2000.  Year  1999 data were consequently used throughout for the sake of consistency.  Peak demand for the Western RTO was  taken as the 1999 annual peak reported by NERC for the WSCC in its year 2000  ""Summer Assessment"".  Coincidental  peak demand for the Northeastern RTO was calculated from 1999 hourly load data  available on the PJM, ISO-New England, and New York ISO web sites.   Installed  Capacity Data: NERC  Electricity Supply & Demand for 2001. While some sets of this data for 2001  are estimates, it can be assumed that the Summer 2001 installed capacity data is  reasonably current. Other estimates can be made available.

From an EPMI standpoint, they are somewhat indifferent to the increase as long as all entities are treated the same and pay the same price.    Guy Sharfman is going to analyse the impact on our books to determine our business interest. Donna Fulton is going to check into the time frame for the proceeding at FERC.  We have already filed an intervention.  The problem in Illinois is that we may face the same problem on transmission that we face with distribution where unbundled customers could pay more for these services than bundled customers.  Thus, in addition to being concerned about our current book, this could adversely affect our ability to attract customers with our new product.  While we do not take on the transmission risk, we still would not be competitive if our transmission rate is higher than what a bundled customer faces.

"I spoke with Craig Glazer (PJM Wash Rep) yesterday afternoon regarding the status of the northeast RTO efforts.  As you may recall, we, along with many other market participants and PJM, advocated a Board makeup for the new Northeast RTO board of 5 PJM Board members, 3 NY board members, and 2 NE board members.  New York and New England are pushing hard for parity - 3 from each board.  PJM is concerned that FERC is going to take the political way out and go with parity.  Our concern with this approach has always been that if all three ISOs are equally represented, progress will not be made in forming the new RTO because the other two ISO board members will retain their bias and preferences for their own ISO sturucture, and development of the northeast RTO will be delayed indefinately.  These three ISOs have been working on the seams issues, through the MOU process, for the past 2 years and absolutely nothing happened -- no progress was made.  FERC recognized this in its July 12 order on mediation.    If FERC does take the political route and order parity on board makeup, then it is imperative that FERC issue a clear, unambiguous order directing that the PJM system be implemented, that not many changes are made to the PJM platform (in the form of ""best practices"" from other ISOs), and that the new Board members' fiduciary duty must be to the new RTO.

That was very positive.  2) The agenda order was changed to allow ample time to discuss the issues.= =20  3) Time and time again it was stated that NERC was running out of time to m= ake the required transition. If not alternatives would be pursued; example = EISB  4) Time and time it was stated that the Goulding task force Recommendations=  should be taken as a package, as a necessary first step.  These include:  1. Committee Representation . The Task Force recommends that the NERC Board=  direct the standing committees to modify the standing committees represent= ation and voting to reflect the Task Force's attached ""Initial Sectors and = Criteria Model."" This Model is based on the Task Force's preference for rep= resentation by ""sector,"" and incorporates the Task Force's general recognit= ion that an RTO sector should be included. The Task Force recognizes that s= ome work remains to be done to refine the definitions of each sector and th= e criteria for belonging, but believes that the Initial Sectors and Criteri= a Model is an appropriate next step and should be taken immediately. Assumi= ng that it may take some months to put in place the details of the new Mode= l, including the new weighted voting procedures, the Task Force recommends = that two ISO/RTO representatives be added immediately to each of the existi= ng standing committees to provide formal representation and a voting role f= or ISOs/RTOs until the Initial Sectors and Criteria Model has been implemen= ted.  2. Committee Participation and Voting . The Task Force recommends open part= icipation in each sector, subject to certain criteria and qualifications. T= he Task Force has evaluated the qualification criteria and voting procedure= s used in several Regions (ERCOT and MAAC), and has incorporated features o= f those procedures into the recommended participation and voting procedures= . Specifically, the Task Force recommends weighted voting by and within eac= h sector, similar to what is done in MAAC.  3. Due Process . The new Organization Standards Process, which will be pres= ented to the Board in October, addresses most due process issues and concer= ns. The Task Force recommends implementing this new process immediately.  4. One-Stop Shop . The Task Force favors having a single organization for d= eveloping Reliability Standards, Market Interface Practices, and Commercial=  Practices. The Task Force believes that NERC has an opportunity to reinven= t itself to become this organization, and should take definitive steps in t= hat direction at its October 2001 Board and Stakeholders Committee meetings= .  5. Funding . The Task Force recommends that steps be taken immediately to d= ecouple the funding of NERC from the Regional Reliability Councils. The Fun= ding Task Group recommendations, adopted by the Board in February 2001, sho= uld be pursued.  6. MIC Role in Standards Approval . The Task Force recommends, as an immedi= ate step to address concerns with the current NERC Standards Approval Proce= ss, and to provide a ""bridge"" until the new Organization Standards process = is implemented, requiring the MIC to vote on all new/proposed NERC Operatin= g Policies and Planning Standards and report results to the Board, includin= g consideration of any minority positions.  5) Lots of discussion about EISB and how NERC may interface with it as a po= ssible alternative.  6) Silence on the issue of ""self regulating organization"" . No one advocati= ng that position.  7) Good opportunity to speak with Trustees one-on-one at dinner.

The customers met for almost 2 hours before the start of the SHC meeting.  = Reps from Enron, Mirant, Dynegy, DENA, APPA and ELCON were present.  All agreed that a unified voice is needed to show strong direction from the=  customer side.  This may mean putting aside some internal positions.  Cust= omers need to show support of the Goulding Task Force recommendations which=  offers a package deal to move NERC forward as a single standards setting o= rganization for both reliability and commercial issues. The Goulding Task F= orce recommendations do fall short of asking for NERC action.  Agenda Item 5 - Scope of NERC over Commercial Issues To ensure unity in appearance, customers agreed to maintain discussions in = front of the Independents at a higher policy level.   Many details are need= ed to get individual entities ""on board"" however, such details should not i= mpede on the ability for customers to show strong support on principles, i.= e.-one-stop-shop, balance of membership, etc.  Therefore, all agreed to kee= p details out of the discussion, i.e.-funding, seats, charter, etc.  The actual SHC discussion was constructive, and persons articulated the nee= d for a package deal to the room. The debate brough the expected concerns o= f the transmission providers to the surface.  TVA (Terry Boston) was most v= ocal about keeping NERC out of the commercial side.   Dominion Resources (G= lenn Ross) supported the customers' position.  PJM (Phil Harris was also su= pportive). =20  Agenda Item 6 - Independence of Security Coordinators Comments made that this is a long standing stalemate at NERC and that NERC = does not have the authourity to require corporate independence. Suggestions=  made to perform better and more audits.  Dave Penn brought up the memo fro= m Roy Thilly.  Need to ask the Board to bring this issue to FERC for resolu= tion.  Good arguments made by customers on need for independence in a new c= ompetitive market structure.  FRCC (Wiley) made arguments that the NERC sho= uld not revamp policies to police the few bad apples.  Should deal directly=  and specifically with the problem.=20  A straw poll was taken of the persons in the room over recommending actions= : 1) NERC should require corporate indepdence and ask FERC to address it. 2) NERC should focus in on the problem Security Coordinators and take speci= fic actions to safeguard independent judgement (audits)  The vote was 21/24.  There were strong comments that this vote was not inte= nded to be an industry representative vote, only to show how split the indu= stry is over this issue.  The meeting adjourned for lunch and the Independents left after the meeting=  reconvened. The SHC agreed to ask the BOT the following:  ?=09Establish a goal/vision to become the one stop shop for development of = wholesale electric industry standards. =20 ?=09Add words that ""we need to go forward from where we are. ?=09Take immediate action to adopt the initial recommendations contained in=  new Board agenda item 22. ?=09Actively solicit cooperation collaboration and support from Canadian an= d US government entities. ?=09Facilitate - jointly with interested trade associations; federal, state=  and provincial regulators, and other stakeholder organizations - an open a= nd inclusive process to achieve consensus on the definitions and attributes=  of the functions necessary for the development of wholesale electric indus= try standards and practices, an on a course of action to institute such cap= abilities. ?=09Interface with state and provincial regulators to address retail operat= ion issues as they affect wholesale operations.

"I have raised these as appropriate items for discussion.  I would prefer not to make these cuts, but I think they are sufficiently in the zone of discretion that we would want to ""stack"" these up against other items under discussion.  The travel reduction mainly reflects the amount budgeted for staff/Member of Congress travel, with nearly one-half of it representing a proposed trip to London.  I think such trips have enormous value, but I also think we have flexibility as to whether they occur, if at all,  in 2002 or '03 or later.  Right now, I am for 2001, about $400,000 under budget.  About $200,000 of that is travel savings.  The amount I have set out for travel reduction in '02 is about the savings I achieved this year.    As for company memberships, $475K has been approved.  In my ""ideal world"" scenario, I requested $423,800.  The reductions I would make would leave me less than scenario two but more than my scenario three request for memberships.  The reductions would be achieved by cutting $100K for the Chamber, which we have agreed to drop.  The other cuts would be $60K for a Telecom Association, we no longer need.  The remaining amount in membership would be achieved through a combination of miscellaneous memberships, $55K of which would be CSI and AEI.   As for contributions, in scenario two I proposed $640K.  Right now $720K has approved in the budget.  I could reduce the $720 to $620 by adhering to the levels contained in scenario two; the additional $20K would be spread out over all  the accounts by reducing them $2 to 5K.    Again, I would prefer to keep the money described herein.  I do think as you look across the full range of government affairs, however, that you would want to have a full picture of potential (but within the zone of reasonableness) savings.  I would not air them but for the extraordinary times in which we find ourselves.  In sum, here is some food for thought.  I will be 100% supportive of whatever you decide.

While it is highly objectionable and our goal is to kill it, to do so we need to respond to requests to be specific about why we don't like it.  One of the more objectionable provisions says that FERC can't change the scope, governance, etc. of any RTO that has been ""approved"" under Order 2000 prior to enactment of the legislation.  If this applies to PJM, the legislation would stop the Northeast-wide RTO in its tracks since several of you and PJM's Phil Harris testified last week that FERC has ""approved"" PJM.  By contrast, committee staff and the section-by-section they distributed on the RTO legislative proposal say that to date FERC has NOT approved any RTOs under Order 2000.  They say that the legislative language would not apply to any RTO as of this date because FERC approvals of PJM, Cal ISO and NePool have been approved under the ""ISO principles"" of Order 888.  Your thoughts on the above would be helpful. Either way, I think we can argue that the provision shows why the Barton proposal is a retrenchment rather than an advancement on RTOs.  If it does not apply to PJM and the others as they contend, there is no good reason to include it other than to ""freeze"" the process at FERC merely by having the legislation pending on the Hill, much less enacted into law.","john.shelk@enron.com, d..steffes@enron.com, l..nicolay@enron.com,   sarah.novosel@enron.com, linda.robertson@enron.com",richard.shapiro@enron.com,RE: RTO Legal Question,2001-10-17 09:12:58-07:00,sent

".. somewhat dependent on who leaves and what gaps are created, but some suggestions -  RTO/wholesale market development, although that area already seems crowded.  transmission rate issues, either from policy perspective (develop in-house talent to displace some of the $500/hr vultures we use) or for specific risk mgmt. needs that are coming up (e.g., Com Ed transmission rate case at FERC and other similar cases we can expect in the future)) specific rate proceedings that need attention (NY unbundling, or types of cases that I've poked around with recently - Georgia Power, Gulf Power, Com Ed  - as they come up) regional support - like Texas retail regulatory issues in support of Jean, if Pat ends up focusing more on other Western states.  I think he could work into any of these areas.  An aside - Alberto and I talked to Frederico Haesler at San Juan gas today and he did say they have made some positive changes in the last year - eliminating some rate classifications and minimizing some rate discounting, which were things recommended before.  He also committed to provide new information to us that would help us help them.  So this is good, although I still would not have us throw a whole lot of time into this.      -----Original Message----- From:  Shapiro, Richard   Sent: Wednesday, October 17, 2001 9:02 AM To: Kingerski, Harry Subject: RE: Decisions..

"Progress?   -----Original Message----- From:  Novosel, Sarah   Sent: Thursday, October 11, 2001 4:46 PM To: Shapiro, Richard; Steffes, James D. Subject: RE: RTO case studies and analysis -- Update  I spoke with Seabrom Adamson and Kevin Wollenus (sp?) about a cost/benefit study.  Seab said that they are not set up to do a detailed modeling analysis, but that Tabors has the programs already set up and could probably do some type of a modeling analysis.  However, we discussed what other type of study we could do, and we came up with a few ideas.  Seab said that there are general benefits to RTO formation:  e.g., transmission expansion (although you still have siting problems, RTOs will build new transmission where it is needed); administrative cost savings; savings from reserve sharing.  We also discussed the arguments of the cheap power states.  For example, many of the southeastern states oppose RTOs because they fear losing their low cost power.  But Seab points out that RTOs do not mean that the states ""lose"" their low cost power.  The PSCs retain their authority to decide whether their utilities can or cannot sell power from their plants to third parties.  The PSCs can prohibit utilities from exporting low cost power if it is needed to serve local retail customers.  Seab thought this response to a potential ""cost"" of RTOs could also be worked into the analysis.  Seab and Kevin are going to give the issue more thought and put together a proposal.  The problem is timing.  Seab has California testimony due on November 6 and he expects to be tied up with that for the next 2 weeks.  If we use the cost/benefit study as part of our NOPR comments (due end of Nov - mid Dec), then he will have enough time.  If we want to present a study before that time (perhaps with comments on RTO week), he will not be able to do the work.  Seab will have a proposal by COB tomorrow or perhaps Monday morning.  I have a call in to Tabors to discuss the same proposal with him.  Larry Ruff is on vacation this week.  He's back on Monday.  We can call him then.  Rick, you also named a few other people:  Charles Stallon, Eric Wolchek, the Brattle Group.  Should I put calls in to these people as well?  Let me know.

"Rick.    We have NOT pursued this aspect from South America.  I do not know if there is anyone in North America looking at this, at least from the perspective of competitive sourcing  to California. This project is in gestation and will take a few years of development, if it is launched.

"Rick -- Sheila Walton is pretty adamant about a couple of things for the meeting tomorrow.  She will be sitting in with me on the phone conversation.  1.  She wants to leave out any indication of giving even an impression, even though we're not using the words, of a ""voluntary"" process.  She recommends the following verbiage for that situation.   We have been working over the past several weeks on finalizing the 2002 budget, and have been tasked to find ways to reduce the 2002 budget.  I have been working very closely with each of my direct reports and the expenses associated with each of the areas, and I feel we have reduced as far as we can on non-personnel related expenses.  However, there is still a need to reduce further, which will necessitate reducing some headcount.  I want to assure everyone that you have my commitment to make this business adjustment as painless as I possibly can.  I will be making the final decisions on the reduction within the next couple of weeks.  If anyone has any questions or concerns that you would like to discuss with me, I will be more than happy to visit with you.     << Leave all references about employees pursuing other career options out.  This would make it perfectly clear that this is NOT a voluntary process.  But you have still left open the door for anyone to come talk to you. >>   2.  Sheila has also said that we need to have decided how we are going to enhance the package and also communicate that to employees.  Since we won't know this by tomorrow, she is saying to tell the employees that the minimum package will be the standard severance package then there would be an enhancement.  The following is how you could address this:  Those individuals affected by the reduction in headcount will be eligible for the Enron Severance Plan for a Business Reorganization.  In addition, I am working on a plan that will look at enhancing the maximum benefits of the Enron plan for this particular initiative.  I expect to have final approval of the terms of the additional benefit early next week. << I've done a preliminary review of the bonuses paid.  It appears that bonuses paid were anywhere from 30% - 55% of base salary -- much less for administrative assistants.  We need to make the determination on how you want enhance.  You can either do it a % of base pay or a set number of additional weeks.  It will just have to be the same for everyone.>>  Hope this helps.  I'll give you a call when I get in so we can discuss before the meeting. Thanks. Jo Ann       ",richard.shapiro@enron.com,ann.hill@enron.com,Tomorrow's Meeting,2001-10-18 18:12:00-07:00,received

"Rick:  Here are a proposal from Richard to analyze the benefits through a detailed modeling approach.  He assumes the Mirant study can be used in the Northeast and the Midwest (provided they do one), but he does not include in the proposal pulling all of this data together to come up with an analysis nationally of the benefits of RTOs.  Presumably that would not be the bulk of the cost of the project.  I am sending next the Seabron proposal which is different from Tabors, so it's good to see different approaches.    Larry Ruff has not returned by calls.  I know he was busy with the ICAP affidavit, but he should have called me by now.  I'll  try again.  I'm also going to see what kind of ideas the Brattle group (Peter Fox-Penner) has.    There was a lot of discussion about the need for a cost benefit analysis during the Thursday morning RTO conference with the State Commissioners, so this remains an important project.  We need to discuss timing.  Neither Tabors nor Seabron can work on this immediately due to the California refund proceeding, but they could do the work if we were to submit a study along with comments in the NOPR proceeding (which would likely be due mid-December).  Let me know what you think.    Sarah  -----Original Message----- From: Tabors, Richard [mailto:rtabors@tca-us.com] Sent: Wednesday, October 17, 2001 9:11 AM To: 'snovose@enron.com' Subject: RCRs for Cost Benefit Studies   Sarah  Attached are three RCR requests for doing the C/B studies for the Southeast and the West  Several assumptions are built in.  1. The desire is to have an analysis that is pretty air tight, i.e. not assertions but analyses 2. Mirant has done the NE (we have the evidence of that) and it is also pretty air tight.  I can't prove this from the PUF article but the numbers look pretty good and we know EEA and they do good work 3. Mirant is going to do / is currently doing the Midwest.  This bye the bye is as big a headache as the West so hopefully they are focusing on the challenges there - like is it possible to have it be a single RTO? 4. To do the west we need to do two things.  A.) coordinate with what we are doing for the people in RTO/W.  Ellen will need to do some talking with them as we go on this.  B.) do a market description analysis as we did for the SE, NE, etc.  It MIGHT be possible to skip this but it would be dangerous.  Our take is that there are really two (possibly 3) ""natural"" market areas in the west and that a single RTO would not make a lot of sense.  This is empirical at this point so figuring it out would be good.  The obvious point is that for us to do this will require serious resources (you are used to that).  It is a tiny bit worse making it fit in 8 weeks max but that looks OK given current staffing and other things that are underway.  Let me know where you are on this when you can.

"I attended a small fundraising dinner last night for Chairman Max Baucus.  At the event, I had a long conversation with the government affairs head of the Mashantucket Pequot Tribal Nation.  As you may recall, the Pequot literally created the enterprise of Indian gaming.  The Pequot's make Bill Gates look like a pauper, as they are worth billions.  Their annual gaming revenue exceeds $1B.  They also own golf courses, ferry services and mail-order pharmaceutical discount networks.  They very much want to talk to Enron about energy investments.  They believe using Indian lands for energy investments stands to be as lucrative as gaming has been for them.  I don't know if this is a pipedream, but they are serious players.

At the event, I had a long conversation with the government affairs head of the Mashantucket Pequot Tribal Nation.  As you may recall, the Pequot literally created the enterprise of Indian gaming.  The Pequot's make Bill Gates look like a pauper, as they are worth billions.  Their annual gaming revenue exceeds $1B.  They also own golf courses, ferry services and mail-order pharmaceutical discount networks.  They very much want to talk to Enron about energy investments.  They believe using Indian lands for energy investments stands to be as lucrative as gaming has been for them.  I don't know if this is a pipedream, but they are serious players.  How should we proceed?  They very much want to talk with us.  Should you and I meet with them next week in DC as an intro meeting?

Tracking and quantifying these activities is important for several obvious reasons - to keep upper management apprised of our activities; to illustrate the value added and risk managed by our group; and to keep each other properly  informed so that we can better coordinate our efforts.   Currently, these activities take place on an ad-hoc manual basis, which is time-consuming and inefficient.  We have a tool already in place to track our activities - the Project Tracking database in Lotus Notes.  Currently this application is used primarily for RCR?s, but beginning November1.2001, the Government Affairs group will use this application to track all projects and efforts  - replacing the need for manual updated spreadsheets and activity quantification ?fire-drills?.  The Projects have several features to allow capture of sub-sets of information, including Updates, Risk, Origination and Valuation.   **  Please note that this will become the only way that we?ll gather this information.  In other words, if you don?t enter your data into Project Tracking, we won?t know what you?re doing! **( all other reports will be eliminated)   The current Lotus Notes application will be discontinued as of October 31,2001 and will be converted to a web-based product.  You?ll find the web-based version as easy or even easier to use than Lotus Notes.  Additionally, conversion to a new database structure will allow for more versatile report extraction.   Before the conversion of the project data from Lotus Notes to Oracle, we need to do some data cleanup.  Please expect a call in the next two weeks from Elizabeth Linnell, Bryan Gottfredson, or Darran Binns to schedule some time with you in person or on the phone regarding your current project list, additional projects to add, and a brief overview of the new system.

"All I've reflected in current.    budget and all that I've accepted from what's proposed here is half of suggested travel reduction or 100,000 dollars...Thamks. -------------------------- Rick S.   -----Original Message----- From: Robertson, Linda <Linda.Robertson@ENRON.com> To: Shapiro, Richard <Richard.Shapiro@ENRON.com> Sent: Tue Oct 16 18:27:46 2001 Subject: RE: Cut proposals for Enron Washington  I have raised these as appropriate items for discussion.  I would prefer not to make these cuts, but I think they are sufficiently in the zone of discretion that we would want to ""stack"" these up against other items under discussion.  The travel reduction mainly reflects the amount budgeted for staff/Member of Congress travel, with nearly one-half of it representing a proposed trip to London.  I think such trips have enormous value, but I also think we have flexibility as to whether they occur, if at all,  in 2002 or '03 or later.  Right now, I am for 2001, about $400,000 under budget.  About $200,000 of that is travel savings.  The amount I have set out for travel reduction in '02 is about the savings I achieved this year.    As for company memberships, $475K has been approved.  In my ""ideal world"" scenario, I requested $423,800.  The reductions I would make would leave me less than scenario two but more than my scenario three request for memberships.  The reductions would be achieved by cutting $100K for the Chamber, which we have agreed to drop.  The other cuts would be $60K for a Telecom Association, we no longer need.  The remaining amount in membership would be achieved through a combination of miscellaneous memberships, $55K of which would be CSI and AEI.   As for contributions, in scenario two I proposed $640K.  Right now $720K has approved in the budget.  I could reduce the $720 to $620 by adhering to the levels contained in scenario two; the additional $20K would be spread out over all  the accounts by reducing them $2 to 5K.    Again, I would prefer to keep the money described herein.  I do think as you look across the full range of government affairs, however, that you would want to have a full picture of potential (but within the zone of reasonableness) savings.  I would not air them but for the extraordinary times in which we find ourselves.  In sum, here is some food for thought.  I will be 100% supportive of whatever you decide.

This proceeding may be of particular interest to Enron given EES's plans to offer physical delivery in Illinois in early 2002.  I've outlined Dynegy's principal arguments below.  Dynegy requested fast-track processing, so any intervention and comments we file are due Friday, Oct. 26.  In order to file a timely intervention (and meaningful comments, if we decide to comment), I need to know your thoughts on this as soon as possible.  Elizabeth and Harlan, I'm copying you because I would especially like to know what you think of Dynegy's characterization of the Firm LD product.  Main argument: Dynegy challenges ComEd's published Business Practice that allows ""marketer firm"" (Firm LD) contracts to be designated as Network Resources.  Dynegy argues that this practice conflicts with the OATT provisions that 1) Network Resources are generation ""owned, purchased or leased by the Network Customer designated to serve Network Load,"" and 2) a Network Customer ""must demonstrate that it owns or has committed to purchase generation pursuant to an executed contract"" in order to designate a Network Resource.  Dynegy's theory on why Firm LD should not be a Network Resource:   - permits designation of network resources that are committed for sale to others, creating reliability problems  - Firm LD under the EEI contract is not capacity-backed, nor is it a commitment to purchase generation  - allows transmission customers to get the advantage of generation capacity without actually paying the cost of that capacity  - since retail providers are allowed to rely on ""over-the-counter"" firm instead of securing long-term contracts, adequate reserves are not being carried to serve retail load   Dynegy claims that ComEd's practice has deprived DMG of payments for capacity and the ability to earn revenues for capacity properly designated as network resources.  It cites specific instances in which ComEd has accepted transmission reservation requests from New Energy and Cilco in which these parties designated Illinois Power as a network resource, when only a Firm LD contracts were in place with IP.

Unfortunately, given the legal nature of this inquiry, we cannot say anything more than this at this time.  We are asking our folks not to engage in conversations or opinion related discussions about this.  Also, Ken Lay will be discussing this at an employee meeting tomorrow morning.

Subject: RE: RTO case studies and analysis -- Update   I spoke with Seabrom Adamson and Kevin Wollenus (sp?) about a cost/benefit study.  Seab said that they are not set up to do a detailed modeling analysis, but that Tabors has the programs already set up and could probably do some type of a modeling analysis.  However, we discussed what other type of study we could do, and we came up with a few ideas.   Seab said that there are general benefits to RTO formation:  e.g., transmission expansion (although you still have siting problems, RTOs will build new transmission where it is needed); administrative cost savings; savings from reserve sharing.  We also discussed the arguments of the cheap power states.  For example, many of the southeastern states oppose RTOs because they fear losing their low cost power.  But Seab points out that RTOs do not mean that the states ""lose"" their low cost power.  The PSCs retain their authority to decide whether their utilities can or cannot sell power from their plants to third parties.  The PSCs can prohibit utilities from exporting low cost power if it is needed to serve local retail customers.  Seab thought this response to a potential ""cost"" of RTOs could also be worked into the analysis.   Seab and Kevin are going to give the issue more thought and put together a proposal.  The problem is timing.  Seab has California testimony due on November 6 and he expects to be tied up with that for the next 2 weeks.  If we use the cost/benefit study as part of our NOPR comments (due end of Nov - mid Dec), then he will have enough time.  If we want to present a study before that time (perhaps with comments on RTO week), he will not be able to do the work.  Seab will have a proposal by COB tomorrow or perhaps Monday morning.   I have a call in to Tabors to discuss the same proposal with him.   Larry Ruff is on vacation this week.  He's back on Monday.  We can call him then.   Rick, you also named a few other people:  Charles Stallon, Eric Wolchek, the Brattle Group.  Should I put calls in to these people as well?  Let me know.

The overall result is to reduce the capital revenue requirement by $24.8 million and expenses by $37.3 million.  In addition, some portion of PG&E' estimated $171 million in electric distribution capital spending will be subject to rehearing. Listed  below are the areas in which the Commission granted rehearing.  1.  Electric Distribution Capital Spending.    The Commission will, in essence, reopen the record, and allow PG&E to put into evidence how much it invested in its electric distribution plant in 1998.  PG&E had used a 1998 forecasted amt of capital expenditures to develop its test year forecast. TURN argued that there was substantial evidence on the record that this amount was never spent. PG&E argued that the record closed prior to the end of 1998 so the best it could do was an estimate.  On rehearing, the Commission agreed with TURN, that there was evidence that the forecasted amount was never spent, so they are allowing PG&E to prove it.  The rehearing order states that any rates that are raised based on the electric distribution capital forecast adopted the GRC decision  may be subject to refund.  2.  Emergency Response Work This work category under electric distribution capital spending was reduced by $17.2 million.  3.  Vegetation Management. The Supplemental Tree Trimming Program was reduced by $9.2 million.  4.  Meter Reading.  PG&E had primarily used accounting changes to justify the large increase in this service.  On rehearing the Commission stated that PG&E had failed to substantiate those changes and reduced the allowed amount by $7.9 million.  5. Account Services.  On rehearing the commission stated that PG&E had failed to show (a) why it cost so much more to provide services to CIA customers  than residential customers ( $43.30 vs. $10.20); and (b) that money was not going for marketing activities that the Commission had disallowed in the previous GRC.  The result was that the commission disallowed $20 million.  6.  Customer Information Systems.

"  The Government Affairs group is involved in diverse and complex activities.  Tracking and quantifying these activities is important for several obvious reasons - to keep upper management apprised of our activities; to illustrate the value added and risk managed by our group; and to keep each other properly  informed so that we can better coordinate our efforts.   Currently, these activities take place on an ad-hoc manual basis, which is time-consuming and inefficient.  We have a tool already in place to track our activities - the Project Tracking database in Lotus Notes.  Currently this application is used primarily for RCR's, but beginning November 1, 2001, the Government Affairs group will use this application to track all projects and efforts  - replacing the need for manual updated spreadsheets and activity quantification ""fire-drills"".  The Projects have several features to allow capture of sub-sets of information, including Updates, Risk, Origination and Valuation.   **  Please note that this will become the only way that we'll gather this information.  In other words, if you don't enter your data into Project Tracking, we won't know what you're doing! **( all other reports will be eliminated)   The current Lotus Notes application will be discontinued as of October 31,2001 and will be converted to a web-based product.  You'll find the web-based version as easy or even easier to use than Lotus Notes.  Additionally, conversion to a new database structure will allow for more versatile report extraction.   Before the conversion of the project data from Lotus Notes to Oracle, we need to do some data cleanup.  Please expect a call in the next two weeks from Elizabeth Linnell, Bryan Gottfredson, or Darran Binns to schedule some time with you in person or on the phone regarding your current project list, additional projects to add, and a brief overview of the new system.

The overall result is to reduce the capital revenue requirement by $24.8 million and expenses by $37.3 million.  In addition, some portion of PG&E' estimated $171 million in electric distribution capital spending will be subject to rehearing. Listed  below are the areas in which the Commission granted rehearing.  1.  Electric Distribution Capital Spending.    The Commission will, in essence, reopen the record, and allow PG&E to put into evidence how much it invested in its electric distribution plant in 1998.  PG&E had used a 1998 forecasted amt of capital expenditures to develop its test year forecast. TURN argued that there was substantial evidence on the record that this amount was never spent. PG&E argued that the record closed prior to the end of 1998 so the best it could do was an estimate.  On rehearing, the Commission agreed with TURN, that there was evidence that the forecasted amount was never spent, so they are allowing PG&E to prove it.  The rehearing order states that any rates that are raised based on the electric distribution capital forecast adopted the GRC decision  may be subject to refund.  2.  Emergency Response Work This work category under electric distribution capital spending was reduced by $17.2 million.  3.  Vegetation Management. The Supplemental Tree Trimming Program was reduced by $9.2 million.  4.  Meter Reading.  PG&E had primarily used accounting changes to justify the large increase in this service.  On rehearing the Commission stated that PG&E had failed to substantiate those changes and reduced the allowed amount by $7.9 million.  5. Account Services.  On rehearing the commission stated that PG&E had failed to show (a) why it cost so much more to provide services to CIA customers  than residential customers ( $43.30 vs. $10.20); and (b) that money was not going for marketing activities that the Commission had disallowed in the previous GRC.  The result was that the commission disallowed $20 million.  6.  Customer Information Systems.  The Commission disallowed $7.2 million as funds which ratepayers had already expended for CIS  rewrites for which they had not received any benefits.

It was strongly opposed by industry and defeated. * When push came to shove, I can't think of a time he didn't side with the utilities. * Even when the Assembly Republicans were doing of good job of bottling up Davis' ridiculous bailout bills in Rod Wright's committee, Pescetti seemed to go along more to tweek the Democrats than to foster competition. * And even then, he followed; he didn't lead--other, more junior, members on the committee led. * Can't recall a time that he's been there for us.

" Hi Rick,  I just met with Meredith Philipp about our external communcations.  She has given me some draft documents for the group that I'll review today.  We'll try to get a final version to you by the end of the day.  They will address various settings, such as panels and roundtable discussions, as well as media.  I think the timing is great, as we are currently the subject of so much interest.  It's feeling like we've moved into a period of crisis management, and people in our group may be put on the spot.  These documents don't go to the issues of the day--just general guidelines for our interactions wherever they may be.  I also mentioned to her that people in our group could use a plain-english briefing on what's going on with investors right now, so that they don't sound uninformed when people ask them about it.  She agreed that it would be good to give people a briefing, and suggested that maybe Mark or Karen could participate in your call on Friday to do that.  Let me know what you think.  Hope DC is more pleasant than 1400 Smith St. is today.

His subtle wit, sly humor, and Texas-sized musical eclecticism made him a force. Built around 13 songs from his first three albums, this compendium resoundingly affirms those gifts. One hears his musical metamorphosis from the beginning, through the stomping blues of ""Why I Don't Know,"" the honky-tonk talking blues ""Give Back My Heart,"" and the folkier ""L.A.

"We fought this issue at the ACC when it was first presented several years ago.  Recall that this was the settlement where we were joined at the hip with the industrials, the industrials cut and run for a rate reduction, and we ended up litigating the case (testimony by Mark Frankena--on local market power, Tom Delaney, Harry Kingerski, and another consultant).  We got our bottoms kicked--although I think we won on the credit for billing our own customers (APS wanted to credit ESPs $0.25/customer--we got the number up somewhere above the cost of postage).  My recollection is simliar to Leslie's re:  the asset transfer and affiliate as the PLR.  It was part of the settlement.  We fought the arrangement and lost.  Recall that we appealled the ACC's decision on the basis of bias and lost.  I'm not a big fan of the ACC ... given our track record.  We have much better political contacts in Arizona now; however, the contacts are with the Gov's office and not the ACC.  Recall that the ACC is elected and is one of Arizona's four branches of government--i.e., the judiciary, the legislature, the executive branch and the ACC (by virtue of Arizona's constitution).  APS may be pushing back a little hard here (25% by 2008), but I'd want a firm indication that there was interest in Arizona before we fight it, and I'd want a clear indication that the market wasn't competitive from a retail perspective without the PLR being 100% short.  When we fought it last time, Frank Vickers and ENA had some interest in the PLR.  We tried to negotiate a deal with Jack Davis to swap some power so the PLR was instaneously being served by other than APS.  We were entirely unsuccessful and Vickers dropped Arizona like it had the plague.    Having said all that, I'm always up for a good fight.  If we can EPSA to step in and spend some money, I'd be happy to help out in any way I can.      -----Original Message----- From:  Shapiro, Richard   Sent: Tuesday, October 23, 2001 6:46 AM To: Kaufman, Paul Subject: FW: APS Filing   Thoughts?   -----Original Message----- From:  Nord, Sue   Sent: Monday, October 22, 2001 5:11 PM To: Shapiro, Richard; Steffes, James D.

"  Message Points on Current Status of Company  A. Our core businesses are strong, performing well and customers continue to demonstrate their confidence in us. B. EnronOnline experienced above average levels for number of transactions  Wednesday (10/24/01), Enron recorded more than 8000 transactions with 1399 external users for a gross notional value of approximately $4 billion  We continue to be the market maker of choice in wholesale gas and power C. Our gas and power numbers indicate that our customer base is not withdrawing, closing out positions, nor reducing transaction levels with us.   Indeed, customers are transacting at higher levels as they prepare their portfolios for the upcoming winter and protect themselves from price volatility.    Media Q & A  What did you receive from the SEC? Enron received a letter and subsequent phone call requesting that we voluntarily provide information regarding certain related party transactions.  When did you receive the request from the SEC? We received a fax on Wednesday afternoon, October 19, 2001, and a phone call on Thursday afternoon, October 20, 2001.  What did you do about the request from the SEC when you received it? An informal inquiry is not a material event; however, because of the high visibility of Enron and the recent public spotlight on the transaction, we convened a meeting of our Board as soon as possible.  We recommended that we announce the SEC request; the Board agreed, and we made the release prior to the market opening on Monday, October 22, 2001.  What are you going to do about the request? We are cooperating fully with the SEC and see the request as an opportunity to put this issue behind us.    These message points will be constantly changing and we will update you as the changes occur.

Thanks again, Courtney   -----Original Message----- From:  Rishe, Frank   Sent: Tuesday, October 16, 2001 4:06 PM To: Votaw, Courtney Subject: RE: Response   Courtney -  I am pleased to offer my comments on how Enron responded to the events of September 11th.  To give you some background, I was at the Houston attending meetings at the Enron Building on the 47th floor, when news of the tragedy hit. I was originally scheduled to return to New Jersey that evening but as a result of the airport closings, I did not get home until late Friday afternoon when I was fortunate enough to be on the first of a number of chartered planes that Enron utilized to facilitate getting employees back to their homes or other destinations.    The following is a brief outline on how I was affected and how the Company and various employees responded:  Shortly after the incident, an announcement was made on the PA system indicating that the Enron building was in no danger, but that anyone who felt uncomfortable being at the office was free to leave. This was reassuring particularly for those who were uneasy being on the higher floors. The Company wisely shut down the building late that morning so there was no question that employees were free to go.  Right from the start, management made it clear that we could do whatever was needed to get home and that the company would be very flexible with respect to travel expenses during the period while we were unable to get home and in travel getting home.  An e-mail from Rick Shapiro, sent to everyone in the Government Affairs expressing his concerns for everyone, served to reinforced what my immediate supervisor, and to say the least was reassuring. By early Thursday, the Company was already making plans to utilized corporate plains to try to facilitate travel for those of us that were stuck one place or another, and I was pleasantly surprised when I received a call from Ginger Dernehl, saying that I was on the list of people going on the corporate jet up to the New York area whenever the airports opened, and that I had to be ""ready to go on short notice"".   Knowing of three other employees from the New Jersey area that were in the same predicament as I was, I gave their names to Ginger Dernehl and Maureen McVicker who were coordinating the list of those needing flights, and they immediately got them on the list as well.  As it turned-out the airports never opened on Thursday, so everything was put on-hold for another day.  However, it was clear that everyone was doing what ever they could, and the thought that kept running through my mind was, ""What a great company to work for!"". The next day (Friday) I arrived at the Office early only to learn that although some commercial air travel had resumed, the ban on corporate air travel was still in effect. My alternative at that point was a Continental Flight to Philadelphia, but whether or not it would actually go was still a question. What I did not know was that the Company was already working on possible chartered flights anticipating that chartered flights might resume before corporate flights. Sure enough, just as I was about to leave to go to Intercontinental Airport, not knowing what nightmarish delays I might encounter, I got that call that a chartered flight was leaving for Albany, NY ASAP and I had to be at 3 Allen Center right away because there was a van waiting to take me and seven other Enron employees to Hobby Airport.  About four hours later we arrived at Albany Airport, where there were two cars waiting to take us to our various destinations.   Although, it was frustrating at times, not knowing when I would actually get home and see my family, the genuine concern shown by everyone involved was so reassuring that it greatly minimized whatever inconvenience I was experiencing.  ""What a great company to work for!""  If you have any questions or need more details, give me a call.

"Rick -- here is the offer letter for Paul.  I believe it has everything noted except if we are going to allow for a house hunting trip prior to his moving.  I'm told this is usually done in conjunction with a business trip, so I'm not sure if that could be worked in for Paul.  In addition, to get any questions answered he may have about the benefits in Mexico, I would suggest that he call Melizza Evanson, the HR Rep that is the liaison for our employees in Mexico.  She works very closely with the HR/Payroll people in Mexico and is the most knowledgeable.  Tim Callahan did say that the Benefits in the UK are greater than they are even in the US, and the benefits in the US are even greater than those in Mexico.  However, he didn't elaborate on the specifics of any particular benefits.  Melizza did say that the cost of living in Mexico is extremely low, so the employees there are provided with a driver, maids, etc.   Anyway, take a look at the letter and let me know if you need any revisions.  And please have Paul call Melizza directly at  (713) 345-7855  with any questions.  Thanks. Jo Ann   ",richard.shapiro@enron.com,ann.hill@enron.com,Paul Hennemeyer,2001-10-29 17:33:54-08:00,received

"Just another person trying to understand what's happened to the world we once knew.....thought you might want to read.   WSJ.com <http://www.wsj.com/?jopinemaowsj> OpinionJournal <http://opinionjournal.com/>  PEGGY NOONAN  His Delicious, Mansard-Roofed World  Faith, effort and love will get us through this trying time.  I found the words on a yellow Post-It I'd stuck on the side of the bookcase in my office about a year ago. It had gotten covered up by phone numbers and pictures and doctor's appointment cards, and yesterday, looking for a number, I found it--a piece of yellow paper with the words ""His delicious mansard-roofed world."" It took me aback. And I remembered what it was.   That night I had been out with friends--it was last fall--and it was fun, and I got home thinking, simply, of something we all should think of more and I don't think of enough: how wonderful it is to be alive, the joy of it, the beauty. And as I thought it--this is the part I remember most sharply--a scene came into my mind of a little French town with cobblestone streets and sharply slanting roofs on 18th-century buildings. Which made me think, in turn, in a blink, of New York, and its older architecture uptown and off the park, the old mansions off Fifth Avenue with sloping mansard roofs, and how this is the world we live in.   And I thought at that moment, with those pictures in my head: ""His delicious, mansard-roofed world."" He being God. I wrote down the words on a Post-It and put it on the bookcase, thinking some day I'd use them in writing about . . . something. Maybe joy. Maybe: us. Or maybe I'd just see them and think: That was a nice moment.   Anyway, the words captured for me a moment of thought.   And last night I found them and thought: Oh--they speak of a moment in time.     <http://opinionjournal.com/images/storyend_dingbat.gif>  Yesterday afternoon, I was with a teenage friend, taking a cab down Park Avenue. It was a brilliant day, clear and sparkling, and as the cab turned left at 86th Street the sun hit the windows in one of those flashes of bright gold-yellow that can, on certain days or at certain times, pierce your heart. We had been quiet, not talking, on the way to see a friend, when I said, ""Do you . . . find yourself thinking at all of the ways in which you might be feeling differently about the future if September 11th had never happened?""   ""Oh yes,"" she said, softly. ""Every day.""   And she meant it. And neither of us said any more and neither of us had to.     <http://opinionjournal.com/images/storyend_dingbat.gif>  There are a lot of quiet moments going on. Have you noticed? A lot of quiet transformations, a lot of quiet action and quiet conversations. People are realigning themselves. I know people who are undergoing religious conversions, and changes of faith. And people who are holding on in a new way, with a harder grip, to what they already have and believe in.   Some people have quietly come to terms with the most soul-chilling thoughts. A young man I know said to me last week, as we chatted in passing on the street, ""I have been thinking about the end of the American empire."" And I thought: Oh my boy, do you know the import, the weight, of the words you are saying? And then I thought Yes, he does. He's been thinking, quietly.   Some people are quietly defining and redefining things. I am one of them. We are trying to define or paint or explain what the old world was, and what the new world is, and how the break between them--the exact spot where the stick broke, cracked, splintered--could possibly have been an hour in early September.     <http://opinionjournal.com/images/storyend_dingbat.gif>  One thing that passes through our minds is what to call the Old World--""The Lost World,"" or ""The Golden Age,"" or ""Then."" We don't have to know yet what to call the New World, and cannot anyway because it hasn't fully revealed itself, and so cannot be named.   But if we can name the Old World, we'll at least know exactly what it is we think we've lost. And this is a funny little problem, because if you go out onto your street right now, if you live anyplace but downtown Manhattan or Arlington, Va., the world outside looks exactly--exactly--like the one that existed a year ago. The pumpkins in the stores, the merry kids, the guy who owns the butcher shop outside smoking in his apron. Everything looks the same. Same people, same stores, same houses.   And yet we all feel everything has changed. And we're right.   People say things like, ""We have lost a sense of certainty,"" and I nod, for it is true. But on the other hand, I didn't feel so certain about the future last year. Did you?   People say we have lost the assumption that what we had would continue. Or, this being America, get better.   Certainly people who were carefree have lost their carefreeness. And with no irony I think: That's a shame. Carefreeness is good.     <http://opinionjournal.com/images/storyend_dingbat.gif>  Lately when I think of the Old World I think of an insult that I mean as a tribute. It is the phrase the narcissism of small differences. In the world that has just passed, careless people--not carefree, careless--spent their time deconstructing the reality of the text, as opposed to reading the book. You could do that then. The world seemed so peaceful that you could actively look for new things to argue about just to keep things lively. You could be on a faculty and argue over where Jane Austen meant to put the comma, or how her landholding father's contextually objective assumptions regarding colonialism impacted her work. You could have real arguments about stupid things. Those were the days! It's great when life is so nice you have to invent arguments.   But the big thing I remember as we approached the end of the Old World, the thing I had been thinking for years and marveled over and also felt mildly anxious about, was this: You could go out and order and eat anything in a restaurant. And I had a sense that this wouldn't last forever, and some day we'd look back on these days fondly.   I would actually think that. It actually seemed to me marvelous that we could order anything we wanted. Raspberries in February! Bookstores, shoe stores, computer stores, food stores. We could order anything. Www-dot-gimme-dot-com.   I think the general feeling was a lovely optimism, which was captured in a great '80s phrase: ""The future's so bright, I gotta wear shades.""   This was the thing: abundance. Not only of food but of potential, of hope, of the kid from the project's dream of being the next J. Lo, or West Point cadet, or millionaire. Every middle-class kid in the suburbs thought it absolutely within his grasp to be the next Steven Spielberg or Russell Crowe, or to play Martin Sheen's assistant on ""The West Wing,"" or run the record industry or direct commercials.   Abundant dreams. There was peace--crime down for the first time in a generation, the world relatively quiet, and in the suburbs they were starting to sleep with the windows open again! And material goods, things from the factory and the farm. As Kevin Spacey says in the commercial for his new movie, ""Your produce alone has been worth the trip!""   God, it was the age of abundance.   Or maybe just: The Abundance.     <http://opinionjournal.com/images/storyend_dingbat.gif>  I know people who are feeling a sense of betrayal at the big change, as if they thought history were a waiter in a crisp white jacket, and though they ordered two more of the same, instead--instead!--he brought them, on a pretty silver platter, something quite dreadful.   They feel betrayed because they thought what we have been living through the past four decades or so was ""life."" But it wasn't, it was ""Superlife.""   In the long ribbon of history life has been one long stained and tangled mess, full of famine, horror, war and disease. We must have thought we had it better because man had improved. But man doesn't really ""improve,"" does he? Man is man. Human nature is human nature; the impulse to destroy coexists with the desire to build and create and make better. They've both been with us since the beginning. Man hasn't improved, the weapons have improved.   In the early 20th century the future was so bright they had to invent shades. They had everything--peace, prosperity, medical and scientific breakthroughs, political progress, fashion, glamour, harmless tasty scandals. The Gilded Age. And then all of a sudden they were hit by the most terrible war in all of European history, the most terrible plague in all of modern history (the Spanish flu) and on top of it all the most terrible political revolution in the history of man. And that was just the first 18 years.     <http://opinionjournal.com/images/storyend_dingbat.gif>  People always think good news will continue. I guess it's in our nature to think that whatever is around us while we're here is what will continue until we're not.   And then things change, and you're surprised. I guess surprise is in our nature too. And then after the surprise we burrow down into ourselves and pull out what we need to survive, and go on, and endure.   But there's something else, and I am thinking of it.   I knew for many years a handsome and intelligent woman of middle years who had everything anyone could dream of--home, children, good marriage, career, wealth. She was secure. And she and her husband had actually gotten these good things steadily, over 25 years of effort, and in that time they had suffered no serious reverses or illnesses, no tragedies or bankruptcies or dark stars. Each year was better than the previous.   It was wonderful to see. But as I came to know her I realized that she didn't think she had what she had because she was lucky, or blessed. She thought she had them because she was better. She had lived a responsible, effortful life; of course it had come together. She had what she had because she was good, and prudent.   She deserved it. She was better than the messy people down the block.   She forgot she was lucky and blessed!   You forget you're lucky when your luck is so consistent that it confounds the very idea of luck. You begin to think your good fortune couldn't be luck, it must have been . . . talent. Or effort. Or superiority.   The consistency of America's luck may have fooled many of us into forgetting we were all lucky to be born here, lucky to be living now, lucky to have hospitals and operas and a film industry and a good electrical system. We were born into it. We were lucky. We were blessed.   We thought we were the heirs of John Adams, Ulysses S. Grant, Thomas Edison, Jonas Salk, Mr. Levitt of Levittown. And we are. But still, every generation ya gotta earn it. It doesn't mean you're better; it means you're lucky, and ya gotta earn it.     <http://opinionjournal.com/images/storyend_dingbat.gif>  How did our luck turn bad, our blessings thin out?   Great books will be written about that. But maybe from this point on we should acknowledge what we quietly know inside: It was a catastrophic systems failure, a catastrophic top-to-bottom failure of the systems on which we rely for safety and peace.   Another way to say it: The people of the West were, the past 10 years or so, on an extended pleasure cruise, sailing blithely on smooth waters--but through an iceberg field. We thought those in charge of the ship, commanding it and steering it and seeing to its supplies, would--could--handle any problems. We paid our fare (that is, our taxes) and assumed the crew would keep us safe.   We thought our luck would hold, too.   The people--us, you and me, the sensuous man on the deck--spent a lot of time strolling along wondering, What shall I pursue today, gold or romance? Romance or gold? I shall ponder this over a good merlot. We were not serious. We were not morally serious. We were not dark. We banished darkness.   The American people knew, or at least those paying attention knew, that something terrible might happen. But they knew the government had probably done what governments do to protect us. The people did not demand this; the government did not do it. Bad men were allowed in; bad men flourished here, fit right in, planned their deeds. They brought more bad men in after them. They are here among us now; they send anthrax through the mail and watch our reaction, predicating their next move perhaps upon our response.   Our intelligence system failed--but then for a quarter century we had been denying it resources, destroying its authority, dismantling its mystique. Our immigration system failed--but then in many ways it had been encouraged to fail. Our legal system failed.   One of our greatest institutions, American journalism, failed. When the editors and publishers of our great magazines and networks want you to worry about something--child safety seats, the impact of air bags, drunken driving, insecticides on apples--they know how to make you worry. They know exactly how to capture your attention. Mathew Shepard and hate crimes, Rodney King and racism: The networks and great newspapers know how to hit Drive and go from zero to the American Consciousness in 60 seconds. And the networks can do it on free airwaves, a gift from our government.   Did the networks and great newspapers make us worry about what we know we should have worried about? No. Did they bang the drums? No. Did they hit this story like they know how to hit a story? No.   In January 2001 the Homeland Security report, which declared flatly that international terrorism would inevitably draw blood on American soil, was unveiled. They called a news conference in a huge Senate office building. Congressmen came, and a senator, Pat Roberts of Kansas. Only a half dozen reporters showed up, and one, from the greatest newspaper in the nation, walked out halfway through. It was boring.   Every magazine and newspaper had, over the past 10 years, a front-page story and a cover on the madmen in the world and the weapons they could seize and get and fashion. But they never beat the drum, never insisted that this become a cause.   Why? In part I think for the same reason our political figures didn't do anything. It would have been bad for ratings. The people don't want serious things at 10 o'clock on a Tuesday night, they want Sela Ward falling in love. I will never, ever forget the important Democrat who told me over lunch why Bill Clinton (president of the United States, January 1993 through January 2001) had never moved and would never move in a serious way to deal with the potential of nuclear and biological terrorism. Because it doesn't show up in the polls, he said. Because it doesn't show up in the focus groups.     <http://opinionjournal.com/images/storyend_dingbat.gif>  It was a catastrophic systems failure, top to bottom. And we all share in it, some more than others.   Except.   Except those who did the remarkable things that day, Sept. 11, 2001--the firemen who charged like the Light Brigade, the businessmen who said, ""Let's roll."" Which is, in part, why we keep talking about them. To remind ourselves who we are in the midst of the systems failure. They did the right thing just by being what they were, which gave us inspiration just when we needed it most.   And now we have to turn it all around.   Great books, as I said, will be written about these days, and the war on which we are embarked, on how it began and why America slept, and what America did when it awoke. Much awaits to be learned and told.   And what we must do now, in our anger and defensiveness, is support, assist and constructively criticize the systems that so catastrophically failed. For those systems still reign and we still need them. And they are trying to function now, and trying to protect us, with the same sense of loss we all share and the added burden of a mind-bending sense of remorse, frustration, anger and pain.     <http://opinionjournal.com/images/storyend_dingbat.gif>  Where are we right now? We have reached the point in the story where the original trauma is wearing off (except in our dreams, where it's newly inflicted), where expressions of solidarity and patriotism are true but tired, and questions about exactly how well our institutions are handling this--not in the past but right now--are rising.   It all began 45 days ago. We know who did the bombings because they were on the planes, and they left receipts.   But we do not know who their confederates here were, do not know who is spreading the anthrax that has hit Florida, New York and Washington, do not know the dimensions of the threat at home.   Authority figures are doubted. The letter carriers don't trust their superiors to take care of them, and how they feel is legitimate and understandable. The workers in the newsrooms, reassured by the boss that if they were going to get anthrax they would have had it by now, do not trust what they're being told, or the tellers. And that is legitimate and understandable.   We are reading anxious reports. Yesterday I read that the Nuclear Regulatory Commission had admitted it kept nuclear plant vulnerability studies out and about and available for any citizen to see in their libraries. (Q: What were they thinking? A: They weren't thinking; they were feeling, and what they were feeling was lucky.)   More and more one senses we're going to have to be taking as much responsibility for ourselves--and on ourselves--as we can. Doing our own research, taking our own actions, making our own decisions, and acting on our own guts.   A week after Sept. 11 I was on a TV show where I said I'd been thinking about ""Mrs. Miniver,"" the 1942 movie with Greer Garson as the doughty British matron who saw her family--and thus her country--through the Blitz. I said that we were all going to have to be Mrs. Minivers now; we're going to have to keep the home front going.   I keep waiting for some talk show or news show to do the Mrs. Miniver segment, telling us what to do in case of real and terrible trouble.   And no one is doing it.   So we must all be doing it ourselves. I am researching and talking to experts. Next week I will talk about ""How to Be Mr. and Mrs. Miniver""--from how much water to buy to where to put it and how to get everyone in your ambit together. I will share everything I'm told and hear. And let me tell you why I think, in all this mess, we must gather together and talk about how to get through it together, as citizens. Because our systems are not fully working yet.   It's a murky time. We're all feeling a little bit lonely, and all of us at one moment or another have the existential willies. Those who have 13 kids and 34 grandchildren are feeling as alone as those who are actually all alone.   We'd all best handle as much as we can ourselves, in and with our own little units.   It may become a terrifically tough time. But we are not alone, as you well know. God loves faith and effort, and he loves love. He will help us get through this, and to enjoy Paris and New York again, and to breathe deep of his delicious, mansard-roofed world.   Amen.

"With your approval, we will send this message to DC based Enron employees.   -----Original Message----- From: Dr. Venessa Holland [mailto:vah@flash.net] Sent: Thursday, November 01, 2001 11:46 AM To: Cooney, Carolyn; Robertson, Linda; Donnie Willman Cc: Barrow, Cynthia; Brindle, John; Maryann Roman de Meza Subject: Enron Washington D.C. office   The CDC has recommended new updated guidelines for facilities receiving mail from the Brentwood facility since October 11.  Individuals in private facilities receiving incoming mail from the Brentwood facility are recommended to receive a 10 day course for prophylaxis with doxycycline.  This should include all permanent employees in the Enron Washington office and possibly other visiting Enron employees to the Washington office who have had possible contact with mail coming from the Brentwood facility.  The final recommendations regarding the completion of the full 60 day prophlyaxis will be based on further information from the CDC.  These are the current recommendations as of October 27 and are subject to change pending recommendations by the CDC.   The CDC has recommended doxycycline for use for prophlyaxis.  Presently, there is no indication that the anthrax is resistant to any antibiotics.  Doxycycline is just as effective as Ciprofloxacin for prophylaxis.  doxycycline is a tetracycline drug and should not be used in anyone who is allergic to tetracycline.  Women who are pregnant should check with their Ob-Gyn physician prior to taking tetracycline.   All ENRON EMPLOYEES are encouraged to take the flu shot this year.  Since it is difficult to distinguish the symptoms of anthrax from the flu, the CDC has recommended that everyone have a flu shot.  All Enron employees from the Washington D.C. office and those who have visited the Washington D.C. office since October 11, should see their personal physician, if they develop any symptoms such as mild fever, muscle aches, malaise, shortness of breath and headaches.  These can be symptoms of the flu.  However, they also can be symptoms of inhalation anthrax.  If any such symptoms should occur, the employees should see their personal physician right away.

"Rick --   1.  We are adding the following paragraph to the exit letters for the group.   Outplacement Services Enron has contracted with Spherion, a leader in outplacement consulting and career transition with 51 offices nationwide.  The Career Transition Program includes the utilization of Spherion's Career Planning Model Methodology which encompasses the completion of a career analysis, broadcast letters and resume, interview training and the development of an individual marketing plan.  A career consultant is assigned to work with the candidate for the duration of the program.  Candidates may also attend on-going sessions for Internet training, library research tips, financial planning and other career-related topics.  Individualized job search coaching and consultation are also provided.  If you have an interest in participating in this program, please notify me and I will make arrangements for a Spherion consultant to contact you.  The program may be initiated as soon as possible, but no later than one month after your termination date.  The program for administrative staff is a 1-month program @ $3,000 -- the program for the professional staff is a 3-month program @ $5,000. QUESTION 1:  Do I add this to Bessie Hiler's package? QUESTION 2:  Donna Fulton has already been working with an independent career planning consultant and would like to continue.  Can she just invoice us (up to $5,000) and continue to use her?  (I've not indicated to her an amount)   I'm OK with it if you are. QUESTION 3:  Do you want these costs accrued this year as well?  2.  Is it OK to send Bessie her package?  I'll have them all complete and ready to overnight tomorrow so they will have in their hands by Monday.  3.  Vacation payouts won't be paid until 1/15/02 for everyone except Lisa.

"1. Dynegy vs. ComEd at FERC  Dynegy filed a complaint at FERC that tries to disallow Firm LD from being used by marketers under the ComEd Network Service.  IP claims that is losing $ MM because customers are not paying for Capacity.  This will impact our ability to ""go physical"" starting next year.  2. MISO vs. ARTO  IP is a member of the ARTO.  EPMI continues to try and establish only one RTO in the region.  I think this is why Dynegy won't state very clearly that 4 RTOs makes sense.  No $ impact, although this decision may impact our ability to ""go physical"" starting next year in Illinois.  3. CTC Bet in ComEd  My recollection (talking with Harry K.) is that we pre-sold a CTC roll-off in ComEd that could cost our business around $10 MM if it doesn't happen.  Most talk in Illinois is that CTC should end early for big customers, so not sure if this is an issue.  4. Delivery Service Tariff Litigation  ComEd and IP have filed to increase their rates on Delivery Service Tariffs (but not on Bundled customers because there is a statutory rate cap).  EES told us originally that this could cost as much as $50MM, but current estimates are closer to $10MM for ComEd and $2MM for IP.  5. PPO (Power Purchase Option) Termination  ComEd is pushing to end the PPO service.  PPO provides a re-sell service to marketers while sharing the Mitigation Factor with customers.  It is the service we use to ""deliver"" today in ComEd.  IP will probably terminate this service because their stranded costs are expected to end sooner, hence, not a major issue for IP?  6.

Ho= w IP will fill this obligation beyond 2004, when it's ""clawback"" contracts = to IP's generation and Clinton expire is unknown...Dynegy should be able to=  answer. Based on my review and understanding of the statute(restructuring)= , Dynegy has little chance of a material risk developing relative to the PO= LR obligation. 2) Stranded cost recovery: Competition Transition Charges or=  stranded  costs are recoverable by IP through 12/31/06( Dynegy does have a= n ROE cap through 2004...it is equal to the treasury bond yield plus 850 ba= sis points). The level of transition charges varies periodically, as the ma= rket price calculation varies( I can explain this later, but it is not part= icularly important). Bottom line: IP has almost zero risk of achieving less=  than 100% recovery of stranded costs.3) Distribution and Transmission  rat= e risk: I won't go into any detail, but there is less risk of achieving les= s than  a compensatory  on T&D assets in Illinois than in any other state i= n the country. 4) California refund amount for Dynegy: Intuitively and base= d on what I know, $530 million exposure should be West Coast Power's max ex= posure, so roughly $265 million for Dynegy...but, I wouldn't take this to t= he bank unless I fully understood the joint venture's documentation. 5)DWR = renegotiation risk: Coming shortly under separate e-mail will be analysis o= f DWR contracts- note that Dynegy contracts(2) are $2.2 billion in the mone= y as of time of analysis....Don't know how to allocate between Dynegy and N= RG...would have to better understand contractual relationships.

It showed a high level of design and thought and it provided a concise view of the teams strengths and weaknesses and how the combinations of them helped it to be effective. It was a professional product and by far one of the best presentations I have seen on this subject.

Linda knows Gail and her husband (it's an old Oklahoma thing), so Linda arranged the lunch for us.  On the RTO front, Gail told us that the MD PSC is not opposed to one Northeast RTO.  They see it as inevitable but they do have concerns about the ""contamination"" problem (i.e., PJM is a good, functioning ISO, New York is not, and Maryland does not want PJM to be contaminated by New York).  They were particularly troubled by FERC's statements that ""best practices"" from New York and New England should be included in the new Northeast RTO.  I told Gail that we are very aligned with their position.  I said we believe PJM is the best market in the U.S. and the ISO is a sound, independent organization.  I said our traders like the liquidity of the western hub, and our goal has been to spread PJM throughout the rest of the Northeast.  I told her that we too are concerned about contamination from New York, which is why we worked so hard to endorse a plan that put PJM firmly in control of the development of the new RTO market design and of the new RTO.  We discussed how New York and New England are opposed to weighting the board towards PJM, but that we believe (and presumably Maryland would support this position) that the new board must be weighted by PJM board members to ensure proper implementation of the PJM model.  At a minimum, PJM must be in charge of implementing the new market design.  Gail also said the MD PSC thought the seams process should be worked out before a single RTO is in place.  I explained to her the problems of the MOU and that we (and most market participants) do not believe that the three ISOs will ever be able to work out the seams issues as long as they remain separate entities.  She was not familiar with the MOU process but seemed to agree that if the seams were not resolved by the entities over the last two years, that it is unlikely that they will ever been resolved.  Gail is going to NARUC next week (she's on the gas committee, which Nora asked her to be on earlier this year), and we urged Gail to find Nora and discuss these issues in more detail.  We told Gail that Nora (coming from the Pennsylvania PSC) understands and agrees with the concerns raised by Gail, but that Nora seems to believe that the way to fix the problem is to implement PJM throughout the Northeast.  Gail also asked about the State/FERC initiative and asked what happened with the Regional Reliability Organization concept.  I told her I will look in to it and get back to her.  As we were finishing lunch, Gail said our discussion was very helpful for her to better understand the issues surrounding a Northeast RTO.  She also said she will try and ""turn down the rhetoric"" from the PSC.  Linda and I again encouraged Gail to talk with Nora next week, and we said we hoped that we (Enron) could work together with the PSC to ensure that the right RTO is implemented in the Northeast.  Linda and I were quite pleased with the lunch and are hopeful that we can get something going with Maryland.  Ending Maryland's opposition to a Northeast RTO would be extremely helpful in the political debate that seems to be taking place.  Let us know if you have any questions or comments.

While OPIC certainly does not have final say re the message on Dabhol they are clearly the driver within the USG and they have been very aggressive in that regard.  Out of our meeting Watson sent to State and the NSC a message with the following two points:  1.  the Project sponsors, the $ lenders, and OPIC and EXIM are of one mind that the negotiating time frame on Dabhol is approaching its end.  If India does not act immediately it will be too late.  2.  The President and this Administration needs to express its strong disappointment at the failure of the GOI to make an effort to engage on the Buyout, which needs to be negotiated within a particular $ range, subject to a simultaneous negotiation with the $ lenders.   The OPIC memo was sent to State and the NSC and is now embodied in talking points for President Bush in his Friday meeting with the PM.  For the last week plus I have provided daily updates to OPIC, to Larson's office at State, to the South Asia regional group and to the NSC so they know of any new developments and where we are.  Yesterday afternoon I  met with OPIC on the lawsuit and how that might change the talking points.   At this point, President Bush will raise Dabhol in his meeting with the PM Friday. The Indian Ambassador met with the NSC yesterday to discuss the agenda and was briefed on the MOU going in.  It is being considered that Larry Lindsey will discuss Dabhol in greater detail, probably with Mishra.  There was some concern about prior relationship to Enron but I understand from State the lawyers have taken care of the concern.     Larson is in Doha but is current on the situation and can engage if necessary.  It is unfortunate he is out of town.  Amb. Blackwill had dinner last night with Watson and Connelly of OPIC and claims he is on top of the issue.   Last, but certainly not least, we have a meeting with the PMO Secretary Ghash (?) at 4:30 Thursday at the Indian Embassy.  I do not know if we have firmly decided yet who should attend.  If Jim is out as I understand he is perhaps Rob Walls and I can attend.  This meeting should give us an opportunity to respond in the Washington context to the proposal that I understand is in the offing in Singapore.  We will then be in a position to feed that information back into the USG so that the President's meeting with the PM reflects the current state of discussions.

Yesterday afternoon I  met with OPIC on the lawsuit and how that might change the talking points.   At this point, President Bush will raise Dabhol in his meeting with the PM Friday. The Indian Ambassador met with the NSC yesterday to discuss the agenda and was briefed on the MOU going in.  It is being considered that Larry Lindsey will discuss Dabhol in greater detail, probably with Mishra.  There was some concern about prior relationship to Enron but I understand from State the lawyers have taken care of the concern.     Larson is in Doha but is current on the situation and can engage if necessary.  It is unfortunate he is out of town.  Amb. Blackwill had dinner last night with Watson and Connelly of OPIC and claims he is on top of the issue.   Last, but certainly not least, we have a meeting with the PMO Secretary Ghash (?) at 4:30 Thursday at the Indian Embassy.  I do not know if we have firmly decided yet who should attend.  If Jim is out as I understand he is perhaps Rob Walls and I can attend.  This meeting should give us an opportunity to respond in the Washington context to the proposal that I understand is in the offing in Singapore.  We will then be in a position to feed that information back into the USG so that the President's meeting with the PM reflects the current state of discussions.

"Rick, I have slowed down a little on this, as the comments are not due until Dec.20 and who knows who/what will be by then.  I too think that ENA (notjust EPMI) should file separately from the pipes and PGE.  The LDC issue is important to the gas side, and we take the position that the new definition is good. I am not sure I share Lisa's view that the rules allow the retail function of the electrics to continue to operate outsidethe OATT, but I will scrub this.  I have jury duty today but I hope I get back to the office eventually.  I cancelled my reservations to Houston for your leadership meeting because I didn't want to pay for tickets if I didn't use them, but if it still looks like a go, I will be there.

She estimates that she'll have a draft ready for distribution on November 13th.    The key issue, of course, is the native load issue.  I'm assuming we'll hit this hard.  Even though FERC is not addressing this issue head on, it is the first time (that I know about) that FERC has expressed an interest in ending the residual - and not insignificant - discrimination that is permitted to exist.  My recommendation to the group is that we support FERC's proposal as a good and long-awaited first step, but it is just that - a first step.  FERC's proposal would eliminate preferential access to information, but what about preferential access to transmission services?   Discrimination will continue until FERC requires all users to be under the same tariff.  Just so you know, my recommendation is that Enron support the application of the standards of conduct to affiliated gas LDCs.  I have heard through the grapevine that certain pipes/LDCs will strongly oppose this proposal.  While I know this isn't our primary issue, I feel it's an important one.    Lastly, my recommendation to Steve Kean was that EPMI and our pipes/wires file separate comments.  I think this is appropriate for appearance sake (it is an affiliate rulemaking after all), but more importantly because we don't want to dilute our message regarding native load.  I wanted to share my thoughts with you before I depart.  Thanks for listening!

"Rick:  With everything else going on, I apologize for raising this issue, but I'm concerned that if I don't, it may fall through the cracks.  I just realized over the weekend that within the next few weeks, I will have paid the full balance on tuition for the Fall 2001 semester in Berkeley's MBA program that I've been in since 1999.  (By the end of this semester, I will have finished 37 of the 40 units that are required to complete the program).  Naturally, I'd like to get reimbursed for the Fall semester's tuition, but I'm concerned that recent events create uncertainty at just about every level of the company.    I know you've got a hell of alot on your plate right now, so there's no need to discuss immediately.  I simply wanted to get it on the radar screen.  Whenever you get a free minute, give me a ring and we can talk about it further. Take care, and thanks for listening.

"Rick -   Dynegy filed at FERC to protest Com Ed's practice of letting Firm LD (""marketer or financial firm"") power qualify as a network resource and therefore be used by marketers for retail contracts.   Dynegy says this deprives them of capacity payments that they are entitled to and threatens reliability because adequate reserve margin is not being carried to serve retail load.  Dynegy believes retail load must be satisfied using Physical Firm products where specific generation is tied to the retail contract.  New Energy and Cilco are the marketers directly implicated.  Enron, Cilco, New Energy, and the ICC have all intervened in support of Com Ed's practice.  Our complaint (Susan Lindberg was author) says financial firm is sufficiently, and perhaps even more, reliable than physical firm; and says Dynegy's proposal in effect would create an unneeded ICAP market.  The ICC goes on to say Dynegy's proposal would impair retail competition by discouraging entry into the retail market.   Here is the Enron filing -    The other case involving IP is the retail rate case where we have intervened to have IP's request for higher delivery rates dismissed.  Our argument is the legal one that their proposal favors bundled customers over unbundled customers.  It's the same argument we made in a similar Com Ed case.

CVM did not oppose at that time;  3) ANEEL took a long time to approve. Enron argued the AES case as a precedent.  4) ANEEL approved contingent upon Enron's having a separate accounting for the transaction, in such a way that it would not interefere with  the rate making process.  5) Other companies who filed later for a similar transactions faced increasing difficulties to get it approved.

" Rick:  I hope that I am not exceeding my authority from Risk Analytics perspective by seeking your permission to comment on the suggested new structure of the Department.  If you think that this is not necessary at this stage, I would like to communicate the following points:  The concern of risk analytics is to ensure the following: 1. The different business activities, and the different regions are well identified and covered, yet not isolated from each other to negatively impact synergy.   2. The suggested structure clearly identifies lines of responsibility, and accountability. 3. The above lines of responsibility, and accountability, pass through your primary support direct system (i.e., Jim Steffes); this is at least as far as the ""regulatory-intensive"" functions.     4. Ensure that support functions (e.g. database management, regulatory research) are well connected to the different components of the Department.

" Follow up on this issue.  I did not hear from Sergio yet.  I checked CVM Resolution # Oficio/CVM/SEP/GEA-1 number 04/01, dated November 08. (Therefore, the Enron/Dynegy merge date is pure serendipity)  The issue is related to the reverse merger, but it is more complex than we thought.  The Commission ordered Elektro to republish 2001, 1Q2001 and 2Q2002 statements. The Commission argues that:  1) The deferral of income tax and social contribution was not legitimate, as it was based on irrealistic profit assumptions 2) That instructions regarding the term to ammortize part of the reverse merger, issues in 1999, have not been followed (CVM instruction 319/99, which approved the reverse merger) 3) The economic rationale for the ammortization of the larger part of the ""premium""  paid for Elektro does not hold any longer and that CVM Instruction 349/2001 is not being followed 4) As per Law 6.385/76, Elektro will have to republish the balance sheets/income statements  Elektro has 15 days to appeal  LM",richard.shapiro@enron.com,luiz.maurer@enron.com,Tax Issues Related to Elektro,2001-11-13 14:10:27-08:00,received
"My initial reaction:  1) Rationing Losses  I was afraid of this outcome. At least on the surface, I do not like it.    I have the impression that  it  washes away Elektro's initial long position as Elektro as it puts and end to Annex V discussions. I would have to see the numbers to check  that this solution is equivalent to Annex V (for Enron). It depends on how one defines ""rationing losses"".   This solution is perfect  for companies like AES, who were both short in the generation and  in the distribution  businesses. They win on both sides. How are they going to treat Annex V provisions when load curtailment reduces to 10% and Annex V becomes a liability for Elektro? What is going to happen with Annex V? (It may be part of the agreement - it is not clear though)  From an elecric sector perspective, this solution corroborates the bail out and the lack of contract sanctity. Bad for future investments.  It would be much more acceptable to increase bulk tariff for generators and allow full pass-through.   2) OK  3) This had already been achieved. It was an MP (Law) enacted by Minister Parente. The only way we were able to get it was to take Aneel to court (here comes my point again - why not being equally bold regarding Annex V? Perhaps AES influence on Abradee?)  What are the terms of final settlement? Will they have any provision regarding Annex V?  "" By  solving the pending issues for the rationing losses, thus eliminating the Annex 5 controversy the MAE should function normally, allowing us to operate Eletrobolt and settle against the pool""  Three comments:  1) Technically not correct - MAE recently stopped because of a legal  injunction of Itaipu  energy.  2) It is key to have a functioning MAE for Eletrobolt. Why has Abradee voted in favor or procrastinating MAE operation three times in the recent past and Enron has not exercised a dissenting vote?

We  reached a conceptual agreement with the government representatives on Sunday night.  The main points are:         1. Rationing losses:   Defined methodology giving distribution companies recovery over the next 36 months of rationing losses realised   from June 01 until the end of rationing in 02. Recovery includes financial compensation. Immediate funding of 80% through BNDES, with Brazilian government funds. Loans liquidated over the 3 year period as tariff increases are realised.  Funding scheduled by December 15th.  Elektro Ebitda impact of approximately R$163 million or US$ 63 million. Corrected numbers in second email         2.  April/May MAE settlement :   Market will settle under current rules due to pre-rationing conditions, confirming the procedures used on Elektro's books.  Impact of approximately R$ 18 million or US$ 7 million.          3.  Parcel  ""A"" for the future:  All non-controlable costs to which LDC's are subjected to including power purchases, sector charges, are passed through to final tariffs either using a tracking account mechanism or by aligning adjustment dates with  the LDC tariff revision date.  Tracking account will be subject to financial compensation from the date costs are incurred until the effective pass through and collection , eliminating a major risk for the distribution sector. Elektro Ebitda impact  2002 forward of R$ 60 million or US$ 19 million, as had been considered in the 2002 plan.  This methodology represents major risk mitigation going forward, as the initial power supply contracts are renewed starting in 2003.          4. Parcel A from the past:   Min Parente has agreed to the concept recovering non controllable  that were not passed through to tariffs since late 1999 using the same methodology agreed to for future recoveries and has a dedicated team from the Federal Attorney General's office targeting a final solution in ten days.    Elektro impact  is R$145 million or US$ 55 million in 2001. The proposed mechanism for recovery is after the 36 months for the rationing losses.    We are currently finalising a memo of understanding and the government team is winding up the settlement with the generators in order to finalize the terms of the overall agreement.  Min Parente has committed to resolving the open issues affecting investors in the power sector.  These  agreements represent a major step forward, significantly improving  the value of our businesses. By  solving the pending issues for the rationing losses, thus eliminating the Annex 5 controversy the MAE should function normally, allowing us to operate Eletrobolt and settle against the pool.    Total amounts for the sector represent about R$ 10 billion or US$3.8 billion at the current rates.  Our team has led the sector negotiations for months since the rationing, and have been instrumental in convincing the government of the need for implementing these changes.

Nugent rambled on about how this is an interesting period we are in and how regulators are being challenges and didn't much of anything. b. Brownell introduced a Georgia Commissioner named Bubba who sang several patriotic songs (she did not address anything relative to FERC policy or activity) c. Thomas spoke about the great state of PA, Benjamin Franklin, William Penn, and Philadelphia and also did not address anything related to policy d. Roberts talked about the future of cable television. 2) The FERC Policy Update - this panel consisted of moderator Nugent, FERC Staff Dan Larcamp, Southern Company Chairman Allen Franklin, James Torgenson of DPL, and PA Commissioner Terence Fitzpatrick.   a. Larcamp and did not provide very much information or in-site into FERC RTO policy.  He did say that they are looking at compatible market rules and protocols across all the RTO's (what he didn't say was that they would be the same rules and protocols).  He said that they are looking at 3 RTO's at least,  In the Midwest the Alliance is moving forward and MISO is getting bigger with the addition of SPP and that FERC is looking at if the Midwest RTO should be 1 or 2 RTO's; in the Northeast they are looking to resolve the governance and market views issues and that all views must be considered (I took this to mean that on governance they are going to go three/three/three from each ISO, but others I talked with outside the session didn't get that - time will tell); and the Southeast will be slower to develop, there are small but clear regional differences that are important, and that it must accommodate the for-profits and the not-for-profits (public power). b. Franklin from Southern said that the state commissioners are ultimately held accountable for RTO's (interesting comment) and there are two major issues to be considered in forming RTO's - cost and reliability and that neither can be taken for granted.  He promoted variable electric transmission pricing similar to natural gas transportation rates and not postage stamp rates (he used the example that in his service territory natural gas is located in the southeast part of the territory while load is centered in the north, but since there is a single electrical transmission rate generation is built close to the natural gas source to avoid the variable gas transmission rate).  He promoted the SETRANS model to accommodate the many public power entities in the south. c. Torgenson of DPL gave a very dry overview of the status of MISO with nothing new to report. d. Fitzpatrick of PA (one of the Commissioners Steffes, Montovano, and I met with in July) began by stating the PA Commission is fully supportive of the NERTO (must have been our July meeting) for two reasons i) advantages of a bigger market, and ii) FERC's clear preference for PJM as the platform.  He mentioned the concern of commissions in other PJM states but, in general there is support.  He then went on to stress the merits of DSM. 3) The last session on infrastructure capital was the most entertaining from an Enron perspective (we have quickly  become the fodder for case studies and Enron is now a verb that is more akin to a four-letter verb.  The panel consisted of moderator Iowa Commissioner Diane Munns, Charles Cicchetti of Pacific Economic Group, Jeff Miller of J.P. Morgan Partners, Christine Uspenski of Schwab Capital Markets, and Walter Rogers of Merrill Lynch Asset Management. a. Cicchetti said that wholesale deregulation has made state regulators' job harder and that they must be market participants (he used the term GONZO market participants).  He also thinks that if transmission planning and expansion is left to the RTO's, no one will build transmission (no reason given) and that regulators need to be involved. b. Rogers' (of Merrill Lynch) most notable comments came as an answer to a question when he stated there are three major issues that are affecting infrastructure investment transactions - California, the downturn in the economy, and ENRON. c. Uspenski from Schwab told the regulators ""Don't get Enron'd"".  That if something presented to you doesn't seem to make sense then it doesn't and they should investigate further. d. Miller from JP Morgan also mentioned Enron several times in the same context as the others.

"Rick  I took a quick  look at the numbers for rationing and what has been achieved.  Orlando's statement that the impact on  EBITDA was US$ 63 million is very misleading.   For a simple reason that we are exchanging a U$ 75 million credit (Annex V) for a LOAN. Obviously, on an EBITDA basis, it may look terrific (this metrics does not take into consideration the payment of the loan). It assumes that the loan is free.  Let's for a second give the benefit of the doubt and assume that the loan is indeed free - because it would be repaid with tariff increases over next 36 months which would not be granted otherwise. In that case, the ""credit""  becomes the loan (I only have the overall figure, but I assume that Elektro's share will be around US$ 40 million.  If that is the case, the result of the negotiation resulted in a U$ 35 million reduction (by excusing Annex V). If one assumes that the tariff increases would happen anyway, the loss is US$ 75 minus the benefit of a subsidized loan. If the latter is U$ 5 million (10% interest and 18% discount rate), the loss would be US 75 million - 5 = US$ 70 million  To summarize.  Orlando states that negotiations on rationing losses resulted on a benefit of U$ 63 million  I challenge that excusing Annex V has costed us something between US$ 35 to 70 million  I am not sure what we should do with those numbers. I am not naive to think that Annex V would be a piece of cake either.  I just want to note that the good news is  not indeed good news: Enron will lose money by foregiving Annex V. If that is a conscious decision made by Enron Corp., that is fine for me. But it has to be a well informed decision.  LM  P.S. As you know, press news are not reliable at all, but there was a news today saying that generators will be gaining up twice.   -----Original Message----- From:  Maurer, Luiz   Sent: Tuesday, November 13, 2001 4:54 PM To: Shapiro, Richard Subject: RE: ESA government negotiations/ corrected  My initial reaction:  1) Rationing Losses  I was afraid of this outcome. At least on the surface, I do not like it.    I have the impression that  it  washes away Elektro's initial long position as Elektro as it puts and end to Annex V discussions. I would have to see the numbers to check  that this solution is equivalent to Annex V (for Enron). It depends on how one defines ""rationing losses"".   This solution is perfect  for companies like AES, who were both short in the generation and  in the distribution  businesses. They win on both sides. How are they going to treat Annex V provisions when load curtailment reduces to 10% and Annex V becomes a liability for Elektro? What is going to happen with Annex V? (It may be part of the agreement - it is not clear though)  From an elecric sector perspective, this solution corroborates the bail out and the lack of contract sanctity. Bad for future investments.  It would be much more acceptable to increase bulk tariff for generators and allow full pass-through.   2) OK  3) This had already been achieved. It was an MP (Law) enacted by Minister Parente. The only way we were able to get it was to take Aneel to court (here comes my point again - why not being equally bold regarding Annex V? Perhaps AES influence on Abradee?)  What are the terms of final settlement? Will they have any provision regarding Annex V?  "" By  solving the pending issues for the rationing losses, thus eliminating the Annex 5 controversy the MAE should function normally, allowing us to operate Eletrobolt and settle against the pool""  Three comments:  1) Technically not correct - MAE recently stopped because of a legal  injunction of Itaipu  energy.  2) It is key to have a functioning MAE for Eletrobolt. Why has Abradee voted in favor or procrastinating MAE operation three times in the recent past and Enron has not exercised a dissenting vote?

We  reached a conceptual agreement with the government representatives on Sunday night.  The main points are:         1. Rationing losses:   Defined methodology giving distribution companies recovery over the next 36 months of rationing losses realised   from June 01 until the end of rationing in 02. Recovery includes financial compensation. Immediate funding of 80% through BNDES, with Brazilian government funds. Loans liquidated over the 3 year period as tariff increases are realised.  Funding scheduled by December 15th.  Elektro Ebitda impact of approximately R$163 million or US$ 63 million. Corrected numbers in second email         2.  April/May MAE settlement :   Market will settle under current rules due to pre-rationing conditions, confirming the procedures used on Elektro's books.  Impact of approximately R$ 18 million or US$ 7 million.          3.  Parcel  ""A"" for the future:  All non-controlable costs to which LDC's are subjected to including power purchases, sector charges, are passed through to final tariffs either using a tracking account mechanism or by aligning adjustment dates with  the LDC tariff revision date.  Tracking account will be subject to financial compensation from the date costs are incurred until the effective pass through and collection , eliminating a major risk for the distribution sector. Elektro Ebitda impact  2002 forward of R$ 60 million or US$ 19 million, as had been considered in the 2002 plan.  This methodology represents major risk mitigation going forward, as the initial power supply contracts are renewed starting in 2003.          4. Parcel A from the past:   Min Parente has agreed to the concept recovering non controllable  that were not passed through to tariffs since late 1999 using the same methodology agreed to for future recoveries and has a dedicated team from the Federal Attorney General's office targeting a final solution in ten days.    Elektro impact  is R$145 million or US$ 55 million in 2001. The proposed mechanism for recovery is after the 36 months for the rationing losses.    We are currently finalising a memo of understanding and the government team is winding up the settlement with the generators in order to finalize the terms of the overall agreement.  Min Parente has committed to resolving the open issues affecting investors in the power sector.  These  agreements represent a major step forward, significantly improving  the value of our businesses. By  solving the pending issues for the rationing losses, thus eliminating the Annex 5 controversy the MAE should function normally, allowing us to operate Eletrobolt and settle against the pool.    Total amounts for the sector represent about R$ 10 billion or US$3.8 billion at the current rates.  Our team has led the sector negotiations for months since the rationing, and have been instrumental in convincing the government of the need for implementing these changes.

I really appreciate the time and effort you have spent keeping everyone informed,  and I'll try to catch up with you in person next Monday or Tuesday instead of bugging you on the phone now.  Unfortunately, I'll be in the air during your next scheduled call.   Your news is not surprising, and we probably can't expect any firm direction until some bigger decisions are taken.   There hasn't been any information available here about whether Japan is core, either.     In the mean time, EPower is taking a lot of Mark's time as they try to figure out how to move their generating plant projects forward.  The EGM activity has slowed down considerably, and Project Sato is stalled until they hear a good explanation, so we are also focusing on the now developing Japanese emissions policy, and finalizing some work for EIM/Forest Products.

I found it interesting to hear you report that Dynegy has expressed interest in Enron's retail business, which has prompted me to write to you to follow-up on our discussion of a week ago.  Clearly a lot has changes in the past week and it seems that the deal with Dynegy should alleviate the paralysis that was understandably taking hold while there was no plan for the future of the company. With that in mind, I wonder if perhaps you might be in a better position to consider the option of utilizing me on a consultant basis in 2002.  Rick, I don't believe there is anyone in the group that has a better handle on the retail issues or has provided better commercial support, and therefore I believe it would make good business sense to consider ways to keep me associated with the group.  Although I can appreciate how busy you are with other priorities, I wanted to raise the question again now while the subject is fresh in your mind and while I am still very much involved with the business.   As I have indicated, I would be willing to consider a consulting arrangement for part or all of next year. This would ensure continuity of coverage as the merger transition proceeds.

Both Enron and Dynegy remain committed to the NWN transaction.  There are no direct implications for the sale as NWN, not Enron, is the issuer of the equity in the transaction.  The structure of the seller financing has not changed.    Bruce DeBolt did describe the only indirect impact of Enron's current situation--i.e., that there are certain restrictions on Enron's ability to transfer the securities it holds to an affiliated interest if Enron's credit rating decays to a given point.    The Enron/Dynegy transaction is expected to close in the 3rd Quarter of 2002.  We think we can get all regulatory approvals for the NWN transaction completed and close before that.    I'm in Washington, D.C. today and tomorrow.  We have a pre-filing meeting with the SEC on the NWN transaction tomorrow.  I'll be back in the office on Friday.

"FYI   -----Original Message----- From: =09Dernehl, Ginger =20 Sent:=09Friday, November 16, 2001 2:45 PM To:=09Shapiro, Richard Subject:=09Government Affairs Organization Announcement   With the announcement of Enron's acquisition by Dynegy behind us, and with = the initial severance process completed, it seemed an appropriate time to e= ffect some organizational changes so that we as a group are better prepared=  to meet the challenges of the future.  Before I turn to the organizational=  changes, I would like to say a few words about those who will be leaving t= he company as a result of the initial severance (you'll know who they are b= y their absence on the organizational chart): Leading and being a part of t= his group has been a privilege?I am thankful for every day that I have had = that responsibility and thankful for however long I continue to have the re= sponsibility.  This sense of privilege and thankfulness is primarily driven=  by having had the opportunity to get to know and care about such a dedicat= ed group of professionals and support staff and who, to a person, are also = very decent and good people.  To say good-bye to some of our colleagues is = not easy.  I want to, on behalf of all of us, thank them for their hard wor= k, their integrity, their decency, and the good times and laughter that we = shared.  I trust that many of us will find ways to sustain friendships that=  have been and will continue to be very special.  Thanks to each of you who=  are leaving for all you have done.  As to the organizational structure, it has become increasingly apparent to = me that the existing organization, with a mix of groups organized along fun= ctional and regional lines (particularly within the U.S.), has impeded our = ability to get things done in the most efficient fashion at times.  The nee= d to rationalize the organizational structure, in order to consolidate all = U.S. energy functions, is a strong need from my perspective.  As a result, = Jim Steffes will lead the U.S. Energy group along with Sue Nord, who will j= ointly report to Jim and myself.  Sue will assist Jim in the leadership of = the group and take on project management responsibilities as warranted to h= elp Jim shoulder a significant burden.  Also reporting to Jim will be a lea= dership group for U.S. Energy that will be as follows:  Wholesale Electrici= ty will be led by Christi Nicolay; Retail Electricity and Natural Gas will = be led by Harry Kingerski; Wholesale Gas will be led by Leslie Lawner.   La= st, but not least, Jeff Dasovich and Sue Mara, who will continue to focus o= n California energy issues, will report to Jim. (Sue Mara will also be part=  of the Wholesale electricity team).  Steve Montovano, who will continue to report to me, will lead a commercial = development effort along with Dan Allegretti.  With the elimination of the regional groups, I also recognize that there is=  a need to continue to focus on how we as a group address our political/leg= islative needs across the U.S.  Paul Kaufman will lead a small group that w= ill address that need and that will focus on state political support.  Paul=  will also take the lead for Government Affairs in support of corporate dev= elopment efforts across the U.S.  Much of the rest of the group remains the same.  Linda Robertson will conti= nue to lead the Washington group with Sarah Novosel, who reports to Linda, = taking the lead role in our coordination of activities at FERC.  Amr Ibrahi= m will continue to lead the support of the Global Assets group and also con= tinue to manage the Risk Analytics function.  Maggy Huson will take over su= pport of the non-energy business units, which are as follows: Global Market= s, Industrial Markets, Networks, and Broadband.  Rob Hemstock will continue=  to lead the support of Enron Canada.  Paul Dawson, who heads up government=  affairs for Europe; Sergio Assad, who heads up government affairs for Sout= h America; and Mike Grimes and Mark Crowther, who head up our Asian efforts= , will continue to jointly report to the business units and myself.  I am also forming a North American leadership group for Government Affairs = to provide policy guidance for the larger group and the company.  That Comm= ittee will consist of Rob Hemstock, Maggy Huson, Amr Ibrahim, Paul Kaufman,=  Harry Kingerski, Leslie Lawner, Steve Montovano, Christi Nicolay, Sue Nord= , Sarah Novosel, Linda Robertson, Jim Steffes and myself.  We will also con= tinue to have an RCR Committee that will consist of Maggy Huson, Harry King= erski, Sue Nord, Linda Robertson, Jim Steffes & myself.  Finally, I am form= ing a Dynegy/Enron regulatory approvals working group that will consist of = Jose Bestard, Paul Dawson, Paul Kaufman, Sue Nord, Sarah Novosel and myself= .  No organizational structure or set of organizational changes is either perf= ect or permanent.  I believe these changes will make us better and more pre= pared for the future.  However, we must be prepared to further adjust as th= e future unfolds for the company.  One final note: I am deeply sorry that each of you has had to live through = this uncertain and troubled period for the company.  We are all saddened by=  the recognition that we are in the midst of changes that will leave our gr= oup fundamentally altered, but we must resolve to do our best for each othe= r and ourselves during this period of change to ensure that what emerges, f= or those of us who do remain a part of the new Dynegy, reflects the excelle= nce and integrity that has characterized our group.

" Thanks for the input.  Attached is the current version of the data to support the PUCT filing.  I have had a couple conversations with Richard Greffe of PUCT staff regarding the requirements of 25.401 and plan to walk him thru the backup workpapers by the end of the month to get any suggestions.  I did mention to Chairman Yzaguirre at a meeting earlier this week that we might be bringing a filing to the Commission but that it was just at the notice threshold--will  mention, as well,  to the other two Commissioners in meetings next week.  While we could possibly play with the numbers and/or timing of the filing to get below the 1% threshold, my inclination is to make a simple informational filing out of an abundance of caution and to create good will.

AEP's Three Year Update of its Market Based Rates  As you may recall, in August, 2000, AEP filed its triennial market based rates review with FERC.  On September 21, 2000 and again on October 20, 2000, EPMI protested that filing, arguing that AEP has market power in transmission so it should not be permitted to continue charging market based rates for wholesale power sales.  Now, 15 months later, FERC is planning to act on the filing.  ""Investigation of Terms and Conditions of Public Utility Market-Based Rate Authorizations""  This proceeding may be linked to the AEP proceeding, although the two are listed separately on FERC's agenda.  While we are not certain what FERC intends to do in this docket, they could be opening up a new investigation into all market based rate authorizations, including non-utility generators and power marketers.  We will monitor this closely and let you know about the proceeding as soon as we learn about it on Tuesday.  Bangor Hydro vs. ISO NE  Bangor Hydro filed a complaint against ISO NE on June 15, 2001 arguing that, due to a design flaw in the electronic dispatch, the ISO should reset the Energy Clearing Prices that were impacted by this design flaw from December 9, 2001 through the end of March.  The ISO opposes Bangor's complaint, stating that it cannot reset prices pursuant to Market Rule 15 unless there was a specific, identifiable error and the ISO posted notice of the error within a certain time period after the error is detected.  New York ISO Extension of Automated Mitigation Procedures  The NYISO filed to extend its AMP until October 31, 2002.  Many parties oppose the extension, others support it.  New England ISO ICAP Proceeding  The Commission issued an order on August 28 regarding the ICAP deficiency charge.  Several parties sought rehearing.  The proceeding on the agenda may be the Commission's order on those rehearing requests.  ConEd's In City Mitigation  ConEd filed to extend the in-city mitigation procedures through October 31, 2002.  Several parties protested, others support it.  Maine PUC v. ISO NE; UI v. ISO NE; Bangor Hydro v. ISO NE  Several entities (Maine PUC, UI, and Bangor Hydro) filed complaints against ISO NE in August, 2000 arguing that the ISO should restate the $6,000 Energy Clearing Price that occurred on May 8, 2000.  18 months later, it looks like FERC may be ready to act on these complaints.  HQ Energy v. NYISO  HQ filed a compliant against the NYISO on December 12, 2000 arguing that the ISO erroneously restated the energy market clearing price for May 8, 2000.  The Commission may be ready to act on this complaint as well.  Because the New England complaints and HQ complaint all relate to the high energy prices that occurred on May 8, 2000, and whether the ISOs should have restated those prices, it is likely that the Commission will rule the same way in each of the proceedings (either that the ISO should have reset the prices or shouldn't have).  Reliant and Mirant v. CAISO  On October 18, 2001, Reliant and Mirant filed a complaint against the ISO arguing that the ISO is giving preferential treatment to the DWR and CERS and is not following the OOM tariff provisions.

"  A few months ago, I sent a note to the North American Government Affairs group commemorating a bit of an end point in our efforts relative to California.  In that memo, I included a quote that went as follows ? ""What we do in life echoes through eternity"".  I think of these words often and believe them more than ever, particularly after the events, both external and internal to Enron, of the last few months.  I do not know for sure what the next few weeks or months will bring for any of us, but I do know that what we've done here at Enron in Government Affairs over the last several years, whether in Houston, Washington, London, Brussels, Sao Paulo, etc. was very good and will be remembered for the positive difference that we have all made in the industries in which we have worked and for each other.  We even had a good time doing it.  The good work we do will go on for many, if not, all of us . . . for some, here; for others, elsewhere.    Regardless of what the future holds, we should all be quite proud of what we have accomplished here and how it has been accomplished.  My personal appreciation for all that you have done as well as at having had the opportunity to be part of a group that, unfortunately, will be inalterably impacted and changed over the next few weeks, is boundless.  Irrespective of where these changes may take any one of us, I will continue to do all I can to earn your trust and respect.    On a more holiday-related note, for those in the U.S., who are working this week, please feel free to leave as early as possible on Wednesday in advance of Thanksgiving to spend time with your families or loved ones.

In that memo, I included a quote that went as follows ? ""What we do in=  life echoes through eternity"".  I think of these words often and believe t= hem more than ever, particularly after the events, both external and intern= al to Enron, of the last few months.  I do not know for sure what the next = few weeks or months will bring for any of us, but I do know that what we've=  done here at Enron in Government Affairs over the last several years, whet= her in Houston, Washington, London, Brussels, Sao Paulo, etc. was very good=  and will be remembered for the positive difference that we have all made i= n the industries in which we have worked and for each other.  We even had a=  good time doing it.  The good work we do will go on for many, if not, all = of us . . . for some, here; for others, elsewhere. =20  Regardless of what the future holds, we should all be quite proud of what w= e have accomplished here and how it has been accomplished.  My personal app= reciation for all that you have done as well as at having had the opportuni= ty to be part of a group that, unfortunately, will be inalterably impacted = and changed over the next few weeks, is boundless.  Irrespective of where t= hese changes may take any one of us, I will continue to do all I can to ear= n your trust and respect. =20  On a more holiday-related note, for those in the U.S., who are working this=  week, please feel free to leave as early as possible on Wednesday in advan= ce of Thanksgiving to spend time with your families or loved ones.  For tho= se not celebrating the American Thanksgiving, you too should try and take s= ome additional time for yourself and families over the next few days, work = and business demands permitting.

"EES is fine with the Org. chart below. I understand the $6.4 million is total for both ENA & EES. Comments:  1.) Need a recommended split of the $6.4 million for ENA/EES. 2.) I understand the $6.4 million includes $0 for Outside Services. The OOC of ENA/EES needs to approve as these services are needed. 3.) The $6.4 million does include legacy real estate costs. Jim Fallon is the coordination point on our real estate costs-is this on his radar screen? 4.) We need to reconcile what we do with Steve Montovano. Because both ENA/EES want to utilize him, I might suggest leaving him in the regulatory group so that both groups can effectively utilize him. Louise/Jim- are you both OK with this? If so, Rick/Jim, I would suggest putting him in the NE Gas Box. 5.) Rick, I understand you're talking with Kean/Whalley on handling the Washington office activity in Corp.

Church, President DATE: November 20, 2001 RE: 2002 Committee & Working Group Chairs Please join me in congratulating the following EPSA committee and working group chairs for 2002. Their tenure will take effect in January 2002. You will note that there will no longer be a Power Marketers Working Group. That group was organized four years ago to assure that issues of interest to marketers were covered. Since that time both our membership and the nature of the issues has changed. Most of our Board and Associate level members now have marketing operations, and issues concerning market development are in the forefront. At this point, having such a subgroup within the Regulatory Affairs Committee causes a lot of confusion. For this reason, the Executive Committee agreed with Julie Simon's and my recommendation to disband the working group after 2001. At the same time, we recommended establishing a vice chair, since the purview of the committee is so broad. 2002 COMMITTEE & WORKING GROUP CHAIRS Environmental Issues Committee Michael Childers, Vice President Mirant Corp.

Church, President DATE: November 20, 2001 RE: 2002 Committee & Working Group Chairs Please join me in congratulating the following EPSA committee and working group chairs for 2002. Their tenure will take effect in January 2002. You will note that there will no longer be a Power Marketers Working Group. That group was organized four years ago to assure that issues of interest to marketers were covered. Since that time both our membership and the nature of the issues has changed. Most of our Board and Associate level members now have marketing operations, and issues concerning market development are in the forefront. At this point, having such a subgroup within the Regulatory Affairs Committee causes a lot of confusion. For this reason, the Executive Committee agreed with Julie Simon's and my recommendation to disband the working group after 2001. At the same time, we recommended establishing a vice chair, since the purview of the committee is so broad. 2002 COMMITTEE & WORKING GROUP CHAIRS Environmental Issues Committee Michael Childers, Vice President Mirant Corp.

I think of these words often and believe t= hem more than ever, particularly after the events, both external and intern= al to Enron, of the last few months.  I do not know for sure what the next = few weeks or months will bring for any of us, but I do know that what we've=  done here at Enron in Government Affairs over the last several years, whet= her in Houston, Washington, London, Brussels, Sao Paulo, etc. was very good=  and will be remembered for the positive difference that we have all made i= n the industries in which we have worked and for each other.  We even had a=  good time doing it.  The good work we do will go on for many, if not, all = of us . . . for some, here; for others, elsewhere. =20  Regardless of what the future holds, we should all be quite proud of what w= e have accomplished here and how it has been accomplished.  My personal app= reciation for all that you have done as well as at having had the opportuni= ty to be part of a group that, unfortunately, will be inalterably impacted = and changed over the next few weeks, is boundless.  Irrespective of where t= hese changes may take any one of us, I will continue to do all I can to ear= n your trust and respect. =20  On a more holiday-related note, for those in the U.S., who are working this=  week, please feel free to leave as early as possible on Wednesday in advan= ce of Thanksgiving to spend time with your families or loved ones.

By Will McNamara Director, Electric Indus= try Analysis    [News item from Reuters] Enron Corp. (NYSE: ENE) shares fel= l sharply in opening trade on Nov. 20 after the humbled energy giant warned=  it could be forced to pay by next week $690 million in debt triggered by a=  credit downgrade last week. The shares were down $1.16, or 12.8 percent, t= o just over $7.00 in early morning trade on the New York Stock Exchange. Th= e stock was the biggest loser by percentage change and the second-most acti= ve stock on the NYSE. As of early morning trading on Nov. 21, Enron shares = were priced at $4.85, reportedly their lowest level in nearly 10 years.   A= nalysis: To paraphrase Shakespeare, ""Oh, what a tangled web they weave when=  first they attempt to?"" Wait, I better stop. When speaking about Enron, I = am not prepared to finish that sentence, at least at this point. Enron has = been accused of a lot of things over the last few weeks, but at this junctu= re an ongoing Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) investigation has ye= t to reach any conclusion regarding deceptive financial reporting on the pa= rt of the Houston trader. Enron itself has admitted that its financial reco= rds from 1997 through the first half of 2001 ""should not be relied upon."" N= evertheless, perception is reality and the perception currently in the indu= stry is that Enron is now taking a fall after getting caught following year= s of skirting the truth. While negative perception continues to cause damag= e to Enron's stock, perhaps of more current interest are the developments t= hat are more grounded in reality. We know Enron has just lowered its third-= quarter earnings, faces a stiff payment of $690 million (due within a week,=  in fact) and has cast doubt over its 4Q earnings potential. The question o= f the hour is whether these new financial hits will represent a ""material a= dverse change"" in the eyes of Dynegy, which still aims to buy Enron but wis= ely included an exit clause in its purchase contract. The other question is= , what happens to Enron if Dynegy leaves it standing at the altar? A termin= ated marriage agreement would surely cause further reductions to Enron's al= ready-weak credit standing, and it is unknown how the company could recover=  from another blow to its reputation.   As has been the case since the firs= t of October, the ongoing ""fall of Enron"" story is changing by the day. For=  background on Dynegy's proposed acquisition of Enron, and Enron's financia= l problems that precipitated the proposal, please see my 11/12/01 IssueAler= t (available at  www.scientech.com/rci ). In the interest of time, let me s= ummarize what is happening at this moment. Dynegy rode in as Enron's white = knight and plopped down a $9-billion offer ($10 a share) to buy the company= , which at the time represented a steal of a price considering that Enron w= as priced at almost $90 a share little more than a year ago. To some extent= , this seemed like the final chapter in the Enron saga. In other words, the=  company had gone through a tumultuous year, hit its ""rock bottom"" but stil= l planned to live happily ever after as part of Dynegy, Inc., its much-smal= ler rival.    The developments just this week amount to a screeching brake = that may in fact interrupt the nuptials between the two companies. For star= ters, on Monday (Nov. 19), Enron submitted its 10-Q report to the SEC (whic= h was five days late, by the way). In the report, Enron dropped what have t= urned out to be several bombshells. First, Enron disclosed that, due to rec= ent downgrades of its credit rating by agencies such as Moody's, Standard &=  Poor's and Fitch, it has to pay off or refinance by Nov. 26 debt it owes t= o a third party with which it has a partnership, or face nearly $4 billion = in additional payments. Enron also has the option of finding new collateral=  to guarantee the debt. Enron would not disclose who owns the note, but we = know that the limited partnership includes holdings in C.E.G. Rio, a Brazil= ian natural gas-company that Enron had planned to sell to raise about $250 = million in cash. Note that just last week, various credit services lowered = Enron's senior unsecured debt to one notch above junk status and warned tha= t further downgrades may occur, which apparently prompted the call for the = debt payment. Reportedly, if Enron does not make the $690-million payment b= y Nov. 27, investors will gain the right to immediately begin liquidating t= he asset for an amount equal to the note payable. Enron is presently scramb= ling to establish a ""mutually acceptable"" amendment with lenders to avoid h= aving to issue payment on the debt. Along with the acknowledgement of the i= mminent payment of $690 million, Enron said that any further drop in its cr= edit rating might necessitate further payments of $3.9 billion to other par= tnerships, the bulk of that figure going to Osprey Trust and Marlin Water T= rust.    Also in the new SEC filing, Enron increased its 3Q 2001 loss by 3 = cents a share to 87 cents. Enron originally reported a 3Q loss of $618 mill= ion, but has now raised that figure to $664 million. As a minor bright side= , Enron did increase reported earnings for the first nine months of 2001 by=  a penny to 20 cents a share, attributed to adjustments made after the quar= ter's end. However, looking forward, Enron warned that continuing credit wo= rries and a decline in the value of some of its assets could take a further=  toll on fourth-quarter earnings. Enron also claims that, even still, the n= umbers contained in the 10-Q report are not necessarily final as they have = not been reviewed by Arthur Andersen, the company's external auditor. Thus,=  further revision of the numbers could take place.    Interestingly, there = does not seem to be a big question about whether or not Enron can pay the $= 690-million debt obligation. Enron apparently has secured an additional $2 = billion in loans from J.P. Morgan Chase and Citigroup in the last week. In = fact, within the current SEC filing, Enron says that is has $1.2 billion of=  domestic cash consisting of the lines of credit and net collections. Thus,=  some investors are reassured by the belief that Enron has the cash on hand=  to make the $690-million payment if it is unable to renegotiate terms with=  lenders. According to the SEC filing, Enron also intends to sell off $8 bi= llion in non-core businesses that are performing ""below acceptable rates"" a= nd would use the proceeds to pay off debts, although this money would proba= bly not be immediately available.   Again, however, there is a perception e= lement to this development that should be noted. Enron has been accused of = financing partnerships in the past in such a way as to keep them off the co= mpany's balance sheets. Apparently, this non-disclosure was done so that En= ron could grow quickly without adding too much debt to its own books or dil= uting the value of its stock. As has been well documented, Enron is already=  in the midst of an intense SEC investigation regarding potential conflict-= of-issues involving its former CFO. News about other financial deals that m= ay not have been fully disclosed is clearly making investors even more nerv= ous about Enron's stock.     As I said, the question of the hour is whether=  or not Enron's new problems will cause Dynegy to reconsider its offer. As = usual, the answer all depends on who you ask. Dynegy is remaining mum and r= eferring all questions about Enron's financial status to Enron. Investors a= re rather mixed on the question. Some say that the facts disclosed in the 1= 0-Q report do not dramatically change Enron's position from what it was whe= n Dynegy launched its acquisition and that the current drop in Enron's stoc= k is just a knee-jerk response to the media hype surrounding the story. Fur= ther, those who diminish any potential impact say that Enron is still a liq= uid company and has money coming in from various sources. Thus, it should h= ave no trouble making the $690-million payment. From a broad perspective, s= o one theory goes, Dynegy is still getting a great deal in Enron due to its=  staggering drop in stock price, and the acquisition remains valuable to Dy= negy as it will position the combined company as North America's biggest ma= rketer and trader of natural gas and electricity.   In contrast, other inve= stors point to the fact that since the purchase agreement was signed, Enron= 's stock has fallen an additional 32.5 percent, which weakens the original = acquisition agreement. In addition, if Enron follows through with the $690-= million payment next week or secures additional financing to front this cos= t, both options alter the company's financial position from when Dynegy mad= e its original offer, which could be construed as a ""material adverse chang= e.""   Another interesting development indicates that Enron may no longer be=  the company that Dynegy agreed to purchase. New reports indicate many ener= gy trading companies are now unwilling to sell power or natural gas to Enro= n for fear about the company's credit concerns. Such companies are now part= icularly reticent to sell power to Enron for next-day delivery. What this m= eans in practical terms is that other trading companies may be gaining Enro= n's market share, which could diminish the value in the trading market that=  had attracted Dynegy to Enron in the first place. In addition, Enron's onc= e-stellar energy trading business could now become reduced or collapse alto= gether.   Questions have been raised why Dynegy is not doing more at this t= ime to help Enron out of its financial mess. Of course, under the acquisiti= on agreement Dynegy already committed to providing an immediate $1.5-billio= n asset-backed equity infusion into Enron to help the company with its curr= ent financial woes, which will be followed by an additional infusion of $2.= 5 billion into the combined company by ChevronTexaco, which owns 27 percent=  of Dynegy. However, some traders apparently have wondered why Dynegy has n= ot done anything about Enron's diminishing ability to secure power on the o= pen market. Traders claim that Dynegy could step in and buy power from sell= ers on the behalf of Enron, in a strategy known as ""sleeving."" The fact tha= t Dynegy has not chosen to take this step has been an indication to some ob= servers that it is only willing to go so far in its pursuit of Enron.   In = addition, Enron shareholders launched a lawsuit on Nov. 12 in state court i= n Houston to prevent the merger with Dynegy from happening. The petition re= portedly alleges that Enron directors breached their fiduciary duties by ag= reeing to sell the company at too low a price and without adequate consider= ation of other alternatives. Enron said it will defend its decision in cour= t.    Moreover, Dynegy was smart to include an exit clause in the acquisiti= on agreement. The clause reportedly allows Dynegy to walk away from Enron i= f any material adverse change occurs related to the outcome of the SEC inve= stigation, possible litigation against Enron, balance sheet strengths, and = earnings forecasts. Certainly the latest developments disclosed in Enron's = 10-Q filing with the SEC impact the company's balance sheet strengths and e= arnings forecasts, so a case could be made that Dynegy would have grounds t= o terminate the acquisition. Clearly, this pending deal hinges on the devel= opments that will take place over the next few weeks. Dynegy ultimately wil= l have to weigh the pros and cons of its acquisition offer for Enron and de= termine if the once-golden company still represents a great deal, or if pur= suing the purchase would cause more trouble than it is worth.

As a minor bright side, Enron did increase reported earni= ngs for the first nine months of 2001 by a penny to 20 cents a share, attri= buted to adjustments made after the quarter's end. However, looking forward= , Enron warned that continuing credit worries and a decline in the value of=  some of its assets could take a further toll on fourth-quarter earnings. E= nron also claims that, even still, the numbers contained in the 10-Q report=  are not necessarily final as they have not been reviewed by Arthur Anderse= n, the company's external auditor. Thus, further revision of the numbers co= uld take place.    Interestingly, there does not seem to be a big question = about whether or not Enron can pay the $690-million debt obligation. Enron = apparently has secured an additional $2 billion in loans from J.P. Morgan C= hase and Citigroup in the last week. In fact, within the current SEC filing= , Enron says that is has $1.2 billion of domestic cash consisting of the li= nes of credit and net collections. Thus, some investors are reassured by th= e belief that Enron has the cash on hand to make the $690-million payment i= f it is unable to renegotiate terms with lenders. According to the SEC fili= ng, Enron also intends to sell off $8 billion in non-core businesses that a= re performing ""below acceptable rates"" and would use the proceeds to pay of= f debts, although this money would probably not be immediately available.  =  Again, however, there is a perception element to this development that sho= uld be noted. Enron has been accused of financing partnerships in the past = in such a way as to keep them off the company's balance sheets. Apparently,=  this non-disclosure was done so that Enron could grow quickly without addi= ng too much debt to its own books or diluting the value of its stock. As ha= s been well documented, Enron is already in the midst of an intense SEC inv= estigation regarding potential conflict-of-issues involving its former CFO.=  News about other financial deals that may not have been fully disclosed is=  clearly making investors even more nervous about Enron's stock.     As I s= aid, the question of the hour is whether or not Enron's new problems will c= ause Dynegy to reconsider its offer. As usual, the answer all depends on wh= o you ask. Dynegy is remaining mum and referring all questions about Enron'= s financial status to Enron. Investors are rather mixed on the question. So= me say that the facts disclosed in the 10-Q report do not dramatically chan= ge Enron's position from what it was when Dynegy launched its acquisition a= nd that the current drop in Enron's stock is just a knee-jerk response to t= he media hype surrounding the story. Further, those who diminish any potent= ial impact say that Enron is still a liquid company and has money coming in=  from various sources. Thus, it should have no trouble making the $690-mill= ion payment. From a broad perspective, so one theory goes, Dynegy is still = getting a great deal in Enron due to its staggering drop in stock price, an= d the acquisition remains valuable to Dynegy as it will position the combin= ed company as North America's biggest marketer and trader of natural gas an= d electricity.   In contrast, other investors point to the fact that since = the purchase agreement was signed, Enron's stock has fallen an additional 3= 2.5 percent, which weakens the original acquisition agreement. In addition,=  if Enron follows through with the $690-million payment next week or secure= s additional financing to front this cost, both options alter the company's=  financial position from when Dynegy made its original offer, which could b= e construed as a ""material adverse change.""   Another interesting developme= nt indicates that Enron may no longer be the company that Dynegy agreed to = purchase. New reports indicate many energy trading companies are now unwill= ing to sell power or natural gas to Enron for fear about the company's cred= it concerns. Such companies are now particularly reticent to sell power to = Enron for next-day delivery. What this means in practical terms is that oth= er trading companies may be gaining Enron's market share, which could dimin= ish the value in the trading market that had attracted Dynegy to Enron in t= he first place. In addition, Enron's once-stellar energy trading business c= ould now become reduced or collapse altogether.   Questions have been raise= d why Dynegy is not doing more at this time to help Enron out of its financ= ial mess. Of course, under the acquisition agreement Dynegy already committ= ed to providing an immediate $1.5-billion asset-backed equity infusion into=  Enron to help the company with its current financial woes, which will be f= ollowed by an additional infusion of $2.5 billion into the combined company=  by ChevronTexaco, which owns 27 percent of Dynegy. However, some traders a= pparently have wondered why Dynegy has not done anything about Enron's dimi= nishing ability to secure power on the open market. Traders claim that Dyne= gy could step in and buy power from sellers on the behalf of Enron, in a st= rategy known as ""sleeving."" The fact that Dynegy has not chosen to take thi= s step has been an indication to some observers that it is only willing to = go so far in its pursuit of Enron.   In addition, Enron shareholders launch= ed a lawsuit on Nov. 12 in state court in Houston to prevent the merger wit= h Dynegy from happening. The petition reportedly alleges that Enron directo= rs breached their fiduciary duties by agreeing to sell the company at too l= ow a price and without adequate consideration of other alternatives. Enron = said it will defend its decision in court.    Moreover, Dynegy was smart to=  include an exit clause in the acquisition agreement. The clause reportedly=  allows Dynegy to walk away from Enron if any material adverse change occur= s related to the outcome of the SEC investigation, possible litigation agai= nst Enron, balance sheet strengths, and earnings forecasts. Certainly the l= atest developments disclosed in Enron's 10-Q filing with the SEC impact the=  company's balance sheet strengths and earnings forecasts, so a case could = be made that Dynegy would have grounds to terminate the acquisition. Clearl= y, this pending deal hinges on the developments that will take place over t= he next few weeks. Dynegy ultimately will have to weigh the pros and cons o= f its acquisition offer for Enron and determine if the once-golden company = still represents a great deal, or if pursuing the purchase would cause more=  trouble than it is worth.

Even as we suffer from a declining economy and terrible acts of murder, as a nation we're still more fortunate than most people on Earth. In many places, malnutrition and dysentery are the rule rather than the exception. Our poverty would be prosperity in most of the countries of the world. In hard times, it's more necessary than ever to remember how rich our lives are.""  Selena Maranjian, ""The Need to Give"" ? <http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=543399>     <http://g.fool.com/art/spacer.gif>   Weekend Warrior <http://g.fool.com/art/email/subheaders/419x40Warrior.gif>  Can You Save $100 a Month? If you cut your spending by $100 a month and invested that money in a tax-deferred retirement account, you would add $145,346 to your nest egg by the time you retire at age 65 (assuming you're 40 now and earn an 11% average annual return). Wow. Pretty inspiring, eh? Try it yourself with this calculator  <http://www.lnksrv.com/m.asp?i=543400>to see how your stats add up. Then check out these guidelines for finding those extra 100 donuts a month:   Do you know how much you spend on groceries? On books? On utilities? If not, fire up any old spreadsheet and start recording your expenses. You can visit the ""How Much Am I Spending?""  <http://www.lnksrv.com/m.asp?i=543401>calculator for a list of categories, and it'll even count the beans for ya. Review your checkbook, bank account statements, and credit card statements and start filling in the blanks.     If you find yourself faced with a lot of ""$100 ATM Withdrawal"" items in your history, you'll need to do a little more work to see where you've been indulging. Try this: Every time you use cash, keep the receipt. If the receipt doesn't list what you purchased, write it on the receipt. Every night, put the receipts in a jar. At the end of the month, enter the items in your expense-tracking spreadsheet and you'll know exactly how much you've been spending.    As you pile up your savings, sock it away regularly -- automatic savings plans are a beautiful thing. You can set up an automatic deposit to a money market fund <http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=543402>, for example, and earn some interest in the short run. When you have enough dough saved to open an Individual Retirement Account, pat yourself on the back, then check out our 60-second guide to IRAs <http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=543403> for the fast track to building your nest egg.   So there's your game plan: Trade a few minor extravagances for the long-term comfort and security of a bulging retirement account. That's a pretty sweet deal.    <http://g.fool.com/art/spacer.gif>   Weekend Features <http://g.fool.com/art/email/subheaders/419x40WeekFeatures.gif>  Refinancing Could Mean Big Savings  <http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=543404> Confused about how to determine if refinancing is right for you?

Time and other cirumstances will dictate the outcome. Since we last spoke about layoffs in my group, the situation has grown worse...as of the moment, and assuming no further erosion, the North American group directly under my charge will shrink next week  to 29 professionals and 5 support staff and a budget of $9.4 million dollars( down from $32.8 million dollars in 2001). In addition, Europe Government Affairs  will likely shrink to no more than 3 professionals and a budget of approximately $750,000 dollars. The layoffs are slated for sometime in the upcoming week(week of November 26) with people departing the same day they are given notice. As you can imagine, this is a particularly painful  process, especially since I hired most of these people as we were building what I considered and will always consider to be a world-class organization. We not only built a  group of Government Affairs professionals who were talented, hard-working and who  had many successes at opening energy markets, but who, also, with few exceptions, embodied a set of values; e.g; honesty, integrity, decency toward others( friend or foe) that were not always as plentiful throughout the Enron culture as many, including myself, would have hoped.           To cut to the quick, I'm tired of the weight that burdens all of us who remain at Enron( I can explain this further) and am actively seeking a change in my personal circumstances.( Steve Kean knows I am looking, but doesn't know specifically about this note...I don't believe he would object given the context). I have thought long and hard about sending this note...it is not easily done. I have also thought about whether it will be percieved as abandonment of my group if I were to move on soon...This may be a rationalization, but after seeing through next week's layoffs, there is little left to do that has not already beeen done. I also believe that ( and you may talk to folks in my group for validation) I have done the very best I could for them over the last few months under challenging circumstances. Bottom line, my skills and personal network , that I believe are considerable, will be grossly underutilized at Enron over the next 6-9 months if I were to stay.( If the acquisition stays on track, this view may  not be exactly right) I'd be happy to talk about this with you further if you so desire. In addition to my work #(713-853-3407) and e-mail, I can always be reached at home(936-321-7153).

"Rick,  Some changes are appropriate regarding the Canada Gov't Affairs Group's use of Enron Canada support staff and the allocation of their salaries to the Gov't Affairs given things like Aleck's departure, Fino's use of support, etc. and the need to generally reduce costs:            Current Allocation   Proposed after Dec 1/01 Lisa Assaf - Toronto      50% of $46,000/year   $0 Sara Butt - Calgary (Fino)   25% of $38,000/year   $0 Linda Sietzema - Calgary (Rob/Randy)  50% of $44,000/year   $0  Megan Scott - Calgary (Rob/Randy)       100% of $28,000/year    This plan will reduce the Enron Canada support staff allocation to Gov't Affairs from its current level of $58,000/year to $28,000/year until end of Q1 2002 when I plan to put a new Gov't Affairs person in Toronto that will need some level of support (say 25% of $46,000).  Are you okay with this?  Please confirm and then I will proceed to have Enron Canada revise its present allocation to Gov't Affairs.

I do not know for sure what the next = few weeks or months will bring for any of us, but I do know that what we've=  done here at Enron in Government Affairs over the last several years, whet= her in Houston, Washington, London, Brussels, Sao Paulo, etc. was very good=  and will be remembered for the positive difference that we have all made i= n the industries in which we have worked and for each other.  We even had a=  good time doing it.  The good work we do will go on for many, if not, all = of us . . . for some, here; for others, elsewhere. =20  Regardless of what the future holds, we should all be quite proud of what w= e have accomplished here and how it has been accomplished.  My personal app= reciation for all that you have done as well as at having had the opportuni= ty to be part of a group that, unfortunately, will be inalterably impacted = and changed over the next few weeks, is boundless.  Irrespective of where t= hese changes may take any one of us, I will continue to do all I can to ear= n your trust and respect. =20  On a more holiday-related note, for those in the U.S., who are working this=  week, please feel free to leave as early as possible on Wednesday in advan= ce of Thanksgiving to spend time with your families or loved ones.  For tho= se not celebrating the American Thanksgiving, you too should try and take s= ome additional time for yourself and families over the next few days, work = and business demands permitting.

I've discussed the quote with Sarah, and have included some new language to make clear that Enron does not support ICAP markets, but while we have them this is a good idea. I haven't shown this language to the ISO yet, as I'm waiting to hear back from Rick on whether Enron wants to be quoted at all.

"Rick,  The information below was provided to us by the FBI's Awareness of National Security Issues and Response (ANSIR) program.  The U.S. Postal Service (USPS) has advised that certain types of incoming U.S. Government mail in the zip code range 202XX-205XX will continue to be irradiated in Lima, Ohio for the foreseeable future.  Mail being irradiated includes letters, flats, packages, express mail and priority mail with stamps for postage.  Mail from known mailers is not being irradiated, which includes USPS Express mail with meter strips and corporate accounts, USPS Priority mail with meter strips or permit indicia, all registered mail, and bulk quantity mail such as catalogs and magazines.  In addition, mail sent through private shipping companies, such as FedEx, UPS, DHL and Airborne, is not being irradiated.  Significant backlogs are occurring at the USPS as a result of the irradiation process.  These backlogs will continue until an additional irradiation facility is tested and opened in Bridgeport, Connecticut.  The USPS recommends that a range of items not be irradiated, including:  magnetic media (credit card, floppy disk, CD-ROM, etc.); plastics sensitive to heat and radiation warping; consumer electronics; photographic film; and photosensitive film and paper.  For these reasons, the FBI recommends using one of the methods mentioned above that will not subject mail to irradiation for corporate communication with U.S. Government offices in these zip codes.
