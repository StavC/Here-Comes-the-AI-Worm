"I am changing the way the curve is generated starting in Jan 2004 to better  replicate seasonal fundamentals.  There are convincing arguments as to why  the summer/winter spreads should tighten over time.  However, in the previous  methodology they blew out.  For instance summer/winter in Cal 3 was .232  while Cal 10 was .256.   I have added a seasonality dampening function that both contracts the  summer/winter spread and applies a premium to the electric load demand months  of July and August over time.  The formula for the curve remains the same except for a premium lookup for  the month as well as for the year.  These premiums are as follows:  Jan  -.008 Feb -.004 Mar -.001 Apr .002 May .003 Jun .004 Jul .004 Aug .004 Sep .003 Oct .002 Nov -.003 Dec -.006   These premiums start in Jan 2004 On Wednesday Jan 2003 settled 2.959,  the 3/4 spread was marked at .0375, the  4/5 spread was marked at .0475.   In the old methodology Jan 2003  = 2.959 Jan 2004  = 2.959 + .0375 = 2.9965 Jan 2005  =          2.9965 + .0475 = 3.044   In the new methodology Jan 2003  = 2.959 Jan 2004  = 2.959 + .0375 - .008 =2.9885 Jan 2005  = 2.9885 + .0475 -.008 = 3.028  The only change in the formula is from: Month x = Month (x- 1 year) + lookup on year on year table to Month x = Month (x- 1 year) + lookup on year on year table + lookup on month  premium table  The seasonality premiums will change over time and I will let you know when I  change them","john.lavorato@enron.com, jeffrey.shankman@enron.com, mike.maggi@enron.com",john.arnold@enron.com,New curve generation methodology,2000-03-29 11:22:00-08:00,sent
"Andy: This past weekend we released a new version  of the EOL software that,  unfortunately, had a bug.  The effect was to lengthen the time delay between  numbers changing and when they would show up on the internet to an  unacceptable level that increased the number of failed trades.  We made the  decision to take some of the more volatile products temporarily offline until  the fix could be made.  I do not anticipate this to be a concern going  forward.  Thanks for the feedback.

"Andy: Just a couple of quick items that need to be addressed.  First, what happens  if the delta of the option is greater than the size of the hedge offered on  EOL?  Second, what strike are straddles traded at.  Are they set at the  nearest 5 cent interval or are they mid-market of the EOL quote?",andy.zipper@enron.com,john.arnold@enron.com,Re: options,2000-04-14 08:34:00-07:00,sent
"Andy: The problem if we limit the size on options to being what size is offered on  the swap hedge, we will not be able to offer adequate size on the options.   Optimally, I think we want to offer a minimum size of 100 across all  strikes.  If the swap is 4/4.5, one a day up, and someone buys half a day,  making the market, 4/4.5 one a day by half a day, the size offered on a 10  cent out of the money call might be as low as 30 contracts, a much smaller  size than most people want to trade.  If we restrict to strikes with a lower  delta, we face the problem of not offering enough strikes and not making a  market in options that have open EOL interest that have moved closer to the  money.   Maybe the answer is to assume the swap hedge to be a penny wide two way  wrapped around the EOL swap mid market.  Thus if the front swap on EOL is  4/4.5 one a day by half a day,  the input into the option calculator is  3.75/4.75, 100 up.  In this case I think 100 is necessary because once a  strike has open interest, we must continue to support it.  Thus I anticipate  having to make markets in deep itm options as the market moves.  In terms of straddle strikes, I think the edge received from buying straddles  struck on the EOL offer and vice-versa is not big enough to compensate for  what I think the industry will view as a scam and another way Enron is trying  to rip people off.  Although striking on the mid-market is probably easier  for the trader, I actually think striking in five cent increments makes more  sense.  It allows people to trade out of the position on EOL.  Whereas if  someone buys the 3085 straddle and the market moves to 3200, they have to  call ENE to close the trade.  If the trade is struck at 3100, we will have a  market on both the 3100 call and put at all times.  Secondly, I would  anticipate non-volatility driven option traders may elect to sell either just  the put or call in this scenario depending on their view of market direction.",andy.zipper@enron.com,john.arnold@enron.com,Re: options,2000-04-16 06:50:00-07:00,sent

And here are the VAR numbers  based on these curves:       5/30/00  5/31/00 AGG-STORAGE (production) 3,027,000  4,516,000 AGG-STORAGE (test, 0.97)  2,858,543  3,011,761 AGG-GAS        (production) 36,627,200  40,725,685 AGG-GAS       (test, 0.97)  29,439,969  31,207,225  You see that the numbers are stable, lower than the official numbers.  I suggest that we use 0.94 decay factor as recommended by Risk Metrics which  would give more weight to recent data. We need to test this approach for a period of time and also to collect  backtesting data for an educated choice of decay factor.  Tanya.

"Good job....I've got 10% of my portfolio in CGP.   Keep up the good work.     ""Cooper, Sean"" <CooperS@EPEnergy.com> on 07/11/2000 08:03:41 PM To:  cc:   Subject: El Paso Energy Corporation Reports Record Second Quarter Earnings  Per Share   http://biz.yahoo.com/prnews/000711/tx_el_paso_2.html  Tuesday July 11, 5:42 pm Eastern Time Company Press Release SOURCE: El Paso Energy Corporation El Paso Energy Corporation Reports Record Second Quarter Earnings Per Share HOUSTON, July 11 /PRNewswire/ -- El Paso Energy Corporation (NYSE: EPG <http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=epg&d=t> - news </n/e/epg.html>) today announced second quarter 2000 adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.69, an increase of 73 percent over second quarter 1999 adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.40. The second quarter 2000 results exclude $0.13 per share of one-time merger-related items. Diluted average common shares outstanding for the second quarter 2000 totaled 242 million. Consolidated adjusted earnings before interest expense and income taxes (EBIT) for the second quarter increased by 55 percent to $408 million, compared with $263 million in the year-ago period. EBIT from the company's non-regulated businesses more than tripled in the quarter to $246 million, and represented 60 percent of consolidated EBIT. ``Outstanding growth in Merchant Energy and continued strong performance in our other non-regulated segments produced these record results,'' said William A. Wise, president and chief executive officer of El Paso Energy Corporation. ``Reflecting our long-standing strategy of building a portfolio of flexible gas and power assets, Merchant Energy's earnings continued to accelerate in the second quarter.'' For the first six months of 2000, adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 84 percent to $1.40 per share, compared with $0.76 for the first six months of 1999. Consolidated EBIT for the six months, excluding non-recurring items, increased 55 percent to $798 million compared with $515 million in the year-ago period. Second Quarter Business Segment Results The Merchant Energy segment reported record EBIT of $152 million in the second quarter 2000, compared with $6 million in the same period last year and $50 million in the first quarter 2000. The physical and financial gas and power portfolio developed over the past several years is creating significant value in the current volatile energy environment. Enhanced trading opportunities around our asset positions, continued strong wholesale customer business, and management fees from Project Electron (the company's off-balance sheet vehicle for power generation investments) all contributed to the record second-quarter performance. The Production segment reported a 30-percent increase in second quarter EBIT to $52 million compared with $40 million a year ago, reflecting higher realized gas and oil prices and lower operating costs following the reorganization of its business in 1999. Weighted average realized prices for the quarter were $2.26 per million cubic feet (MMcf) of natural gas and $19.21 per barrel of oil, up 12 percent and 29 percent, respectively, from the year-ago levels. Average natural gas production totaled 512 MMcf per day and oil production averaged 14,275 barrels per day. The Field Services segment reported second quarter EBIT of $30 million, nearly double an adjusted $16 million in 1999. The increase was due primarily to higher realized gathering and processing margins, together with the acquisition of an interest in the Indian Basin processing plant in March 2000. Second quarter gathering and treating volumes averaged 4.1 trillion Btu per day (TBtu/d), while processing volumes averaged 1.1 TBtu/d. Coming out of one of the warmest winters on record, the Natural Gas Transmission segment reported second quarter EBIT of $190 million compared with an adjusted $187 million a year ago, reflecting the realization of cost savings from the Sonat merger. Overall system throughput averaged 11.3 TBtu/d. During the quarter, Southern Natural Gas received Federal Energy Regulatory Commission approval of its comprehensive rate case settlement filed in March. The International segment reported second quarter EBIT of $12 million compared with $16 million in 1999. Higher equity income from projects in Brazil and Argentina largely offset lower equity earnings from the company's investment in the Philippines. Telecom Update ``We have made substantial progress in the development of our telecommunications business, El Paso Global Networks,'' said William A. Wise. ``Reflecting our market-centric approach to developing new businesses, we have named Greg G. Jenkins, the current president of El Paso Merchant Energy, to head our telecommunications business. Our expertise in building businesses in rapidly commoditizing markets, as demonstrated by our Merchant Energy success, provides us with a key competitive entry point in the telecommunications marketplace.'' Quarterly Dividend The Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.206 per share on the company's outstanding common stock. The dividend will be payable October 2, 2000 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on September 1, 2000. There were 237,786,853 outstanding shares of common stock entitled to receive dividends as of June 30, 2000. With over $19 billion in assets, El Paso Energy Corporation provides comprehensive energy solutions through its strategic business units: Tennessee Gas Pipeline Company, El Paso Natural Gas Company, Southern Natural Gas Company, El Paso Merchant Energy Company, El Paso Energy International Company, El Paso Field Services Company, and El Paso Production Company. The company owns North America's largest natural gas pipeline system, both in terms of throughput and miles of pipeline, and has operations in natural gas transmission, merchant energy services, power generation, international project development, gas gathering and processing, and gas and oil production. On May 5, the stockholders of both El Paso Energy and The Coastal Corporation overwhelmingly voted in favor of merging the two organizations. The combined company will have assets of $35 billion and be one of the world's leading integrated energy companies. The merger is expected to close in the fourth quarter of this year, concurrent with the completion of regulatory reviews.

Second quarter 1999 results         exclude merger related charges of  $(131) million pretax, or         $(86) million aftertax, a gain on sale of assets of $19 million         pretax, or $12 million aftertax, and the resolution of regulatory         issues of $30 million pretax, or $20 million aftertax.  Year-to-date         2000 results exclude the extraordinary gain on the sale of the East         Tennessee and Sea Robin systems of $89 million aftertax and merger         related charges of $(46) million pretax, or $(31) million aftertax.         Year-to-date 1999 results exclude the cumulative effect of an         accounting change of $(13) million aftertax, merger related charges of         $(135) million pretax, or $(86) million aftertax, ceiling test charges         of $(352) million pretax, or $(222) million aftertax, a gain on sale         of assets of $19 million pretax, or $12 million aftertax, and the         resolution of regulatory issues of $30 million pretax, or $19 million         aftertax.     (b) Proforma diluted loss per common share reflects reported diluted         earnings per share but assumes dilution.  Reported diluted loss per         common share does not assume dilution because dilution would reduce         the amount of loss per share.

"Interesting observation...but I'm not sure I agree.   I think consensus  opinion is that anything under 2.7 TCF is very dangerous entering the  winter.  A month ago, analysts were predicting we would end the injection  season with around 2.6 - 2.7 in the ground. With the most recent AGA, those  projections seem to be closer to 2.7.  With supply of gas very inelastic to  price in the short and medium term, you must look at the demand side of the  equation.  The market is trying to price out the right amount of demand  (mostly through lost industrial load and fuel switching) such that supplies  will be stored rather than burned.  Each AGA number is another data point as  to whether nat gas is high enough to price out enough demand to reach a  comfortable level in storage entering the winter.   A low AGA number  indicates we haven't priced out enough demand and the market must go up.   Certainly, the 97 throws a curve in the bull argument, but the number  may be  a function of very mild weather, a four day holiday weekend, and reporting  noise rather than indicative of a structural shift in the supply/demand  equilibrium.  We'll know a lot more as the next two weeks' numbers come out.   If we get two low injections, watch out.        Enron North America Corp.

In the  beginning of the season, AGA's were  very important in framing the bull  case.  The current expectation is that we will go into the winter under  stored.  I don't believe any additional AGA news can significantly change  that expectation.   However, I believe Bears, as evidenced today, will feed more heavily off of  bearish AGA news, than bulls will off bullish AGA news.  At this juncture, I believe that the most potent bullish news has to come  from the physical market and weather.   I hope you don't mind me expressing my view point on this issue.

We are having difficulty backtesting Larry May's VaR.   It looks as if during  the month of June, the book administor  loaded the spreadsheets into ERMS but  assigned multiple master deal ID's.  (the code is ""NG-OPT-XL-PRC"") For example Larry May is showing the following during the month of June:  June 1st  $797 million dollars loss June 2nd +192 million dollars made June 5th $300 million dollars made... (etc..)  This problem makes it impossible to backtest....  Second, regarding a different approach, the immediate solution was the  allocation of an additional $5 million dollars of VaR, thereby temporarily  increasing your limit to $45 million.  This limit increase is in effect until  July 26th.  The game plan is that during this time period, a better solution  can be devised.....   I hope this helps.

"Frank: One of the most likely scenarios for a VAR blowout would be a severe cold  front hitting the country in the middle to latter part of the winter.  In  such a circumstance, cash may separate from prompt futures similar to how  Midwest power traded $5000+ on specific days last year while prompt futures  were $200.  The correlation between prompt and cash is normally very strong,  and is indicated by the small VAR associated with a spread position  currently.  But in the winter that may change. Another thing to keep in mind while developing this scenario is the  assymetric risk presented by having a spread position on.  Assuming we enter  the winter with normal to below normal storage levels, a position of long  cash, short prompt futures has a long tail only on the positive p&l side.    While such a trade in an efficient market has expected payout of 0, the  payout probabilities may look like the following:  20%  $ -.05 40%     $ -.02 20% $ 0 19% $ .03 1% $ 1            Enron North America Corp.

"Although I would prefer to see the counterparty name for failed transactions,  it is not of great importance and I certainly understand a third party system  not supplying us with that info.     Andy Zipper@ENRON 07/31/2000 01:51 PM To: John Arnold/HOU/ECT@ECT cc:   Subject: Houston Street  John,  As you are probably aware we did a click through deal with Houston Street,  whereby EOL prices would be posted on their platform. The initial thought was  that this would be transparent to the trading desks; they wouldn't care  whether the trade came from Houston Street, True Quote or EOL (although we  could make the platform name available to you if you so desired.) This still  will be the case except for one problem: Houston Street does not want us to  reveal the counterparty name to the trader in the event of a failed  transaction. I don't know whether this is an issue for you or not, but I  would like to know. We will probably run into this issue with any platform we  deal with for obvious anonymity reasons.

The InterContinentalExchange (ICE), an Atlanta-based venture initiated by seven major oil companies and banks is due to launch August 24 for trade in precious metals swaps, with energy products trade to go live soon afterwards.    While market transparency will increase as dealers used to over-the-counter (OTC) telephone-based market trade on a screen, users of the ICE will remain nameless up until the point of trade, Jeffrey Sprecher, ICE's chief executive officer told Reuters in an interview.    ""As soon as you hit the deal, the system reveals both counterparties,"" he said. ""The real strength is that you (still) get the ability to manage your own counterparties.    ""You can list all of the people you want to do business with and put in the credit terms under which you will do business.""    This information will then be processed by what Sprecher called a ""giant matrix"" within the system.    ""(At the moment) people in the over-the-counter market aren't sure they have ever seen the entire market,"" he said.    ""(On the ICE), deals you can do will appear in white and deals you can't do will be in grey, but you can see the entire market.""    Giving players a fuller complement of figures than they are currently aware of in a telephone-dominated market should increase market transparency, as they can keep abreast of the activities of dealers who fall outside their own trading criteria, Sprecher said.    The exchange is expected to function in real time around the clock and will be accessible via the public internet or a private network connection.    Initial liquidity will be provided by founder members BP Amoco <BPA.L>, Deutsche Bank <DBKGn.DE>, Goldman Sachs <GS.N>, Morgan Stanley Dean Witter <MWD.N>, Royal Dutch/Shell <RD.AS><SHEL.L>, Societe Generale <SOGN.PA> and TotalfinaElf <TOTF.PA>.    Shell runs the industry's largest international oil trading operation and Goldman Sachs' J.Aron commodities arm last year was dominant internationally in unregulated OTC oil derivatives.    Late in July the original cast was joined by six gas and power companies, American Electric Power <AEP.N,> Utilicorp's Aaquila Energy <UCU.N,> Duke Energy <DUK.N,> El Paso Energy <EPG.N>, Reliant Energy <REI.N> and Southern Company Energy Marketing <SO.N>.    Sprecher said continued liquidity would be ensured by the fact that the founding members will pay fees even if they do not trade and will face additional penalties if they fail to live up to their commitment to trade a minimum volume.     TRADERS STILL TO DO OWN CLEARING    As well as increasing awareness of market moves, Sprecher believes trading over the Internet could boost trading profits. ""The economics (of the system) will be driven by the fact that a paperless back office can really save a lot of money,"" he said.    However such savings on trading the ICE appear some way off given that dealers will initially have to continue using their own clearing systems, as they do in current OTC systems.    Under the ICE, once a deal has been struck both counterparties will receive an electronic deal ticket which will then go through those players' own risk management systems.    But the exchange is eager to look at ways of introducing its own clearing system.   ""No one really knows how at the moment,"" Sprecher said. ""There might be some hybrid between traditional exchange clearing and what now exists peer to peer.""   In terms of participation costs, no membership fees will be incurred except those associated with trading. Membership is open to any commercial market participant.    Each product will have its own published commission schedule, which Sprecher assessed at ""slightly below the best prices someone would pay in the voice broker business"".

The approach we're  taking to develop this Fileplan is to perform a generic  inventory of each  ENA organization's records. Now, we generally meet with an executive (usually  a vice president, director or manager) within each group to first explain  this project and seek permission to perform the inventory. We'll then ask  that executive to designate someone within his/her area to serve as our  working contact. The contact is usually someone who is very familiar with  their department's record, and can be a manager or support staff.  There are a number of reasons we are working on this ENA Fileplan Project.  Enron, as I am sure you know, creates volumes of paper and electronic  records--much of it has never been captured on a records retention schedule.  Many departments are keeping records well beyond their legal retention  requirements, taking up valuable and expensive office space. The Fileplan,  once completed, will document what is being created, who has responsibility  for it, and how long it must be maintained.  Enron has also invested in a software product called Livelink. Livelink is an  imaging system whereby you can scan your documents into it, index them, and  then use the ""imaged"" document viewable from your computer as the working  copy. After scanning, the paper can either be destroyed or transferred to  offsite storage, depending upon its retention requirements.   During our inventory we will attempt to capture both paper and electronic  records. We'll also try to identify any computer systems your area uses, i.e.  MSA, SAP, etc.. The inventory itself is painless and non-invasive, in that we  do not open or look into file cabinets or desk drawers. It's simply an  interview process where the contact answers a few easy, simple questions.   If you have any additional questions, please feel free to give me a call.   Thank you.

I will be mostly interested in getting the following information from you  tomorrow:  1) Are you expecting an increase in headcount?  If so, what level of person? 2) What percentage increase in salaries for 2001? 3) Will you increase the # of analyst and associates used in this cost center? 4) What special pays, sign on bonuses, employee agreement, etc. do you want  to plan for? 5) Are you expecting any promotions? 6) If you increase headcount, would this person(s) come from placement  agencies?  Would we need to plan relocation costs for them? 7) Do you expect to use any consulting firms or outside temporaries? 8) Will you have any employee offsites or customer meetings that we should  plan for?  If so, how much and where? 9) Will you have any large capital expenditures other than computers,  monitors and software? 10) Do you anticipate any other changes in this cost center that we should  plan for (ie, opening of another office, etc.)  My last day in this group is Thursday so I was trying to get this finished  before Paula Harris took over.

"Please take me off your email list     Jennifer Green <jgreen@aedc.org> on 09/01/2000 02:50:03 PM To: ""AEDC Members"":; cc:   Subject: data standards   Dear AEDC Member,  One of the most interesting developments in the economic development arena is the creation of the AEDC/CUED/EDAC Site Selection Data Standard.  This standard, long in the making, provides an opportunity for economic developers and their customers to have one common means of presenting and examining data.  Adoption of the standard promises real time savings and more effective economic development decisions as communities will be more comparable than ever before.  A copy of the standards is attached so that you can take a look at it to see how the data standards can be made to work for you.  There are 25 tables in the standard presented in an excel format.  The tabs at the bottom of the page will access the additional tables.  You can assemble your own data for the data standard tables or you can use the services of ACN, the American Community Network. AEDC has entered into a strategic partnership with ACN to provide much of the data necessary for the standards.  ACN will provide data and provide future updates of the standard to AEDC members at a discounted rate. It is your call as to which approach works best for you.  Adoption of the standards promises great changes for the economic development profession.  They should be of particular advantage to the many areas that have great economic development opportunities but which haven't received the consideration they deserve.  The standards are a great way to tell their story.  If you'd like more information on the use of the standards, look for notices of upcoming courses offered with AEDC's National Seminars on the standards and their use.

"I'm not sure what is happening on my position.  It may have to do with how  you shaped the forward vol and price curves at each level.  My VAR is so  dependent on spread levels and vols that a small change in the Jan vols could  produce that effect.   The results certainly provide evidence of a need for higher VAR going into  the winter. John        Enron North America Corp.    From:  Frank Hayden @ ENRON                           09/15/2000 06:32 PM    To: John J Lavorato/Corp/Enron@Enron, John Arnold/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: Vladimir Gorny/HOU/ECT@ECT, Sunil Dalal/Corp/Enron@ENRON  Subject: Stress Test  The below file shows the results of the two stress test requested.  Under the  $7 dollar stress, NYMEX curve was shifted to $7 dollars with all other price  curves proportionally shifted.  Under the $9 dollar test, not only were the  price curves shifted, but volatilites were stressed as well with NYMEX  volatility going to 100% and all other vol locations being raised accordingly.   Key findings include: $7 dollar stress only raised VaR by 79%   $9 dollar stress raised VaR by 134%            It is interesting to note that with the seven dollar stress, VaR on the  financial desk actually decreased.  This would seem to imply that up to the  seven dollar strike, the financial desk is long gamma (which overall reduces  risk).  But between the seven dollar and nine dollar strike, it appears that  the desk becomes short gamma, thereby acceralatering the amount of risk and  increasing VaR by 74%.  Does this make sense or is something else happening?

"Russell: I think I should give you a little background on small ventures.  Bill  Perkins and I have a strong personal and professional relationship.  He is an  extremely creative individual.  Whalley actually commented on him today as  someone ""who thinks outside the box"".  Bill actually sat in a bar four years  and said the next tradeable market would be bandwidth.  He has been  successful in the gas business when he has had someone to filter his ideas.   As such he provides an informal consulting role to Enron.  He throws out  ideas and, every once in a while, he comes up with a great one.  He pointed  out an anomalous pricing occurence in the options market, a market I normally  don't follow closely, that I translated into a multimillion dollar trade for  Enron.  In return, I have agreed to have Enron intermediate his trades within  reason.  I want to emphasize that continuing this relationship should be  considered a high priority.  I am willing to accept some of the credit risk  exposure as a cost of doing business.  Bill understands his role as an  independent in the market and performs the right risk/reward trades for  someone with finite capital.  I place very high confidence in Bill not  conducting high risk trades.  Having said that, we certainly need to monitor  his credit exposure and continue to require LC's.  Just understand that he is  at a different level of sophistication that any other non-investment grade  counterparty.  I understand there was some concern in regards to the Transco Z6 spread  option he traded.  He was absolutely right about the valuation and we, on the  trading desk, knew it as well.  There are a couple isolated products that  Enron does not do a good job of valuing because of systems limtations.  This  was one product.  Our spread options are booked in Excel using option pricing  models created by the research group.  The problem with these models is that  they are strictly theoretical and don't take into account gas fundamental  price limitations.  For instance, it is less probable, though not impossible,  for a transport spread from a production area to a market area to go within  variable cost than the models predict.  Thus it is necessary to apply a  correlation skew curve on top of the overlying correlation used.  Obviously,  we have this function in our pricing models.  I was not aware this  methodology had not been transferred to the valuation models.  This has since  been changed.  Fortunately these incidents tend to be extremely rare as very  few non-investment grade companies trade these types of products.    Finally, on Friday Bill wanted to do a trade that reduced his exposure to  Enron.  I gave Mike Maggi the go ahead to do the trade without consulting  credit.  I do not believe that I acted out of line in approving this trade  considering the circumstances.  If you believe differently, please advise.

"Adam: Good question.  The exchange, NYMEX, and I, Enron Online, offer a nearly  identical product.  The fight is over which execution model is superior.  I  would argue that technology will make open outcry exchanges extinct.  It's  happened in Europe already.  The largest commodity exchange in Europe, the  LIFFE, went with a parallel electronic system to open outcry.  Within weeks,  the floor was deserted and virtually all trading occurred electronically.  I  still trade on the exchange because we have credit issues with individuals  and certain hedge funds that limit the trading we can do with them direct.   The exchange still provides a credit intermediation function that is useful.   It is certainly an issue that we are trying to address.

What we need to focus on is the first bullet in Allan's list;  the need for a single set of requirements. Although the meeting with Keith,  on Wednesday,  was informative the solution of creating a infinitely dynamic  consolidated position screen, will be extremely difficult and time  consuming.  Throughout the meeting on Wednesday, Keith alluded to the  inability to get consensus amongst the traders on the presentation of the  consolidated position, so the solution was to make it so that a trader can  arrange the position screen to their liking (much like Excel). What needs to  happen on Monday from 3 - 5 is a effort to design a desired layout for the  consolidated position screen, this is critical. This does not exclude  building a capability to create a more flexible position presentation for the  future, but in order to create a plan that can be measured we need firm  requirements. Also, to reiterate that the goals of this project is a project  plan on consolidate physical/financial positions and transport trade capture.  The other issues that have been raised will be capture as projects on to  themselves, and will need to be prioritised as efforts outside of this  project.  I have been involved in most of the meetings and the discussions have been  good. I believe there has been good communication between the teams, but now  we need to have focus on the objectives we set out to solve.

We've had  three meetings which brought out very different issues from different  traders.  We really need a single point of contact to help drive the trader  requirements and help come to a consensus regarding the requirements. We're getting hit with a lot of different requests, many of which appear to  be outside the scope of position consolidation.  Things left to do: I think it may be useful to try to formulate a high level project goal to  make it as clear as possible what we're trying to accomplish with this  project.  It'll help determine which requests fall under the project scope. Go through the list of requests to determine which are in scope for this  project and which fall out of scope. For those in scope, work to define relative importance (priority) of each and  work with traders to define the exact requirements of each. Define the desired lay out of the position manager screen: main view and all  drill downs. Use the above to formulate a project plan.  Things requested thus far (no particular order): Inclusion of Sitara physical deals into the TDS position manager and deal  ticker. Customized rows and columns in the position manager (ad hoc rows/columns that  add up existing position manager rows/columns). New drill down in the position manager to break out positions by: physical,  transport, swaps, options, ... Addition of a curve tab to the position manager to show the real-time values  of all curves on which the desk has a position. Ability to split the current position grid to allow daily positions to be  shown directly above monthly positions.  Each grouped column in the top grid  would be tied to a grouped column in the bottom grid. Ability to properly show curve shift for float-for-float deals; determine the  appropriate positions to show for each: Gas Daily for monthly index, Physical gas for Nymex, Physical gas for Inside Ferc, Physical gas for Mid market. Ability for TDS to pull valuation results based on a TDS flag instead of  using official valuations. Position and P&L aggregation across all gas desks. Ability to include the Gas Price book into TDS: Inclusion of spread options in our systems.  Ability to handle volatility  skew and correlations. Ability to revalue all options incrementally throughout the trading day.   Approximate delta changes between valuations using instantaneous gamma or a  gamma grid. Valuation of Gas Daily options. A new position screen for options (months x strike x delta).  TBD. Inclusion of positions for exotic options currently managed in spreadsheets. Ability to isolate the position change due to changed deals in the position  manager. Ability to view change deal P&L in the TDS deal ticker.  Show new deal terms,  prior deal terms, and net P&L affect of the change. Eliminate change deals with no economic impact from the TDS deal ticker.

Unfortunately, our customer would like  to settle on 7 days, using the preceding day for any day for which Gas Daily  is not published (i.e., Friday prices would be used for Saturday and Sunday)  - so I know it's not your preference, but I need to take advantage of your  offer.

I assume it is the former, not the  latter.  Is this correct?  Are you indifferent if we want to switch to the  latter?  Intuitively, it would seem to me that at this point, it wouldn't  matter (because Friday or Monday prices are just as likely to be above the  average as below the average), but you're wearing the risk, not us - so let  me know.  Frankly, we don't have a preference as a desk, except that we need the  settlement to be consistent with the deal we are entering into with SMUD.   SMUD has questioned our calculation and I need to know how much I need to  argue for one or the other.

"Adam: Hope your interview goes well.  Things are going crazy in the gas market so,  unfotunately, I'm stuck at my desk and can't go up for interviews.    As far as the interview goes, my advise would be the same as any interview.   Be confident.  Answer the question asked.  Don't be afraid to say you don't  know but don't make excuses.  Express interest in why you find Enron  appealing compared to the other 100 companies interviewing.    The trading training program is still in the works.  Few people outside the  trading area are even aware of its existence at this point so I wouldn't ask  any questions about it in the interviews.  If you receive an offer, it would  probably be for a normal analyst position with the opportunity to enter the  training program when you arrive.  Not sure about that last statement  though.   The training program is geared towards our two most mature and pure  trading business areas: gas and power.  There are still a large number of  other trading spots in our developing commodities side that would not fall  under the program.   That's a function of the program being developed by the  head of these two businesses.  Not ready to take it corporate-wide yet.  Write me about how your interviews went.

"Certainly encourage CSFP to transact all volumes with us.  If they shop the  deal, everyone will front-run the volumes and they won't get a good price on  the deal.   Financial deals settle 5 days after the index has been published.  Physical  deals settle much later.   My understanding is this is a financial deal.            From:  Russell Dyk @ ENRON                           10/23/2000 12:43 PM    To: Paul Radous/Corp/Enron@ENRON cc: Per Sekse/NY/ECT@ECT, Caroline Abramo/Corp/Enron@Enron, John  Arnold/HOU/ECT@ECT, Sara Shackleton/HOU/ECT@ECT, William S  Bradford/HOU/ECT@ECT  Subject: CSFB Columbia/Appalachia Hedging Deal  The New York office has been speaking to Credit Suisse First Boston for  roughly 6 months about a producer hedging deal that is part of a strucutured  deal they're putting together. It now looks as if it will get done in the  next 3 weeks-1 month so we want to get all the necessary credit issues taken  care of.   In brief, the deal is a fixed price one, basis TCO (67% of the volumes) and  CNG (33%) with a fixed price Nymex component as well. It will settle against  the Inside FERC indices for both locations. The term of the deal is from  December, 2000 to December 2012. The volumes decline throughout the term from  roughly 22,000 mmBtu/d to 13,000 mmBtu/d. The average daily nominal volume is  17,000 mmBtu/d. As I understand it, these volumes are about 65% of the  producers' total volumes. I've attached a spreadsheet to this message with  more details.   There are a couple of contractual and credit issues that CSFB wants to  clarify.   First, there is a question of the monthly cash settlement. CSFB would like  payment to take place on the fifteenth of the month following the date both  the floating and fixed prices are known. As I understand it,  for the  December settlement, which would be known in early December, cash payment  would take place on February 15, 2000.   Second, there is a question of a parent guarantee from Enron Corp.  Apparently, there is an existing credit arrangement in place between ENA and  Credit Suisse First Boston International - the same counterparty that we  would be dealing with here - that has a $15 million guarantee from Enron  Corp. CSFB would like to increase this guarantee to at least $100 million.  (CSFB already has an unlimited guarantee from Enron Corp. for a deal they've  done with us in Europe so in their opinion it should not be an issue).    There is another minor issue involving centralizing credit discussions with  the aim of securing a similar credit arrangement for CSFB's dealings with  EnronCredit.com - which may be an issue for London rather than Houston.  However, CSFB agreed that this was a secondary issue in relation to this  transaction.  CSFB would like to do the entire deal through us, rather than having to split  it among one or more counterparties. Per, Caroline Abramo, and I are meeting  with Paul tomorrow to discuss various credit issues, including this one.  Ideally, CSFB would like to have a good idea of where they stand by the end  of this week.   Please let me know if you have any questions or suggestions.

We actually had a conversition over the phone. I  also sent him E-mail to describe the problem. So far I haven't heard anything  from him yet. I adoult if he can solve the problem. In order to solve this  browser issue, I suggest we can have 5-10 traders to install IE5.5 on their  PC. If everything works fine, we can update everyone into IE5.5. It is really  not my decision weather or not to use IE5.0 or 5.5. Right now everything is  ready for users to test the application except the browser issue.

"Re: trucking LNG to California -   The short answer is that trucking LNG to California is not a feasible option  for endusers other than companies with LNG-fueled vehicle fleets. There are a  couple of reasons for this.   First, California has a relative abundance of LNG fueling stations but only  two plants capable of regasification. One serves Borrego Springs, a small,  affluent desert community near San Diego. The other is dedicated to military  and industrial supply near Sacramento. I spoke this morning to Applied LNG  Technologies, which is based in Amarillo and has the second largest LNG truck  fleet (after Transgas in Massachusetts). It shouldn't be a surprise that I  was not the first to call regarding this question. While ALT's fleet is  operating at capacity - trucking LNG from liquefaction plants in Wyoming and  Topock, Arizona - it's serving its normal fleet customers in Southern  California and Nevada, and Arizona. The Topock, AZ plant is owned jointly by  ALT and El Paso, and receives gas from El Paso for liquefaction and  subsequent loading onto trucks.  Second, LNG trucks, unlike LNG tankers, carry an extremely small volume. The  average truck carries 10,000 gallons of LNG, which translates roughly into  820,000 cubic feet. ALT has about 23 vehicles so potentially one could  deliver 18.8 mmcf. However, these trucks don't regasify LNG, they merely  transfer it into storage.   The only really viable option for putting gas into the pipeline system would  be a portable pipeline unit, of which ALT has the only one (it's under  repair). It can deliver high pressure gas at 1800 cubic feet/minute (2.6  mmcf/day if it runs 24 hours). It has connections for two LNG trucks at a  time - one live and one backup, so it can operate continuously. In the past,  ALT has used the unit to cover industrials who had a supply outage for some  reason.   I'm going to continue gathering info on domestic LNG peakshaving plants, etc.  I think the opportunity may lie more in future, more strategically located  peakshaving plants rather than LNG trucking arbitrage.   Please let me know if you have specific questions.    ",john.arnold@enron.com,russell.dyk@enron.com,LNG on the road,2000-12-11 05:27:00-08:00,received

"a couple more thoughts.  certainly losing lots of indutrial demand both to  switching and slowdown in economy.  Big 3 automakers all temporarily closing  plants for instance.  switching is significant and has led to cash in the  gulf expiring weak everyday.  gas daily spread to prompt trading at  $1....need some very cold weather to justify that.  this seems to be the test  of the next 3-5 days.   Will the switching/loss of demand/storage management  keep cash futures spread at reasonable levels or will it blow to $5+. Not too  many years ago we had a $50 print on the Hub.  unless we get some crazy  prints, you have to question the steep backwardation in the market.    funny watching the flies in the front.  Bot large chunk of g/h/j at $.50  friday morning.  probably worth 1.30 now.  crazy.  people have seen each  front spread be weak since forever and are already starting to eye up g/h.    what's the thoughts on distillates...  is it tight enough such that gas  switching is the marginal mmbtu of demand and pulls it up or is the market  too oversupplied to care?",slafontaine@globalp.com,john.arnold@enron.com,re:summer inverses,2000-12-11 09:04:00-08:00,sent

"John, Following up on yesterday, there are two additional considerations.   First, with regard to the idea of curtailing gas input at the Topock  liquefaction plant, the pipeline bottleneck is actually downstream of the  plant, so that wouldn't help.   Second, it seems there are more of these ""portable pipeline"" units floating  around than I thought. Besides the inoperable unit in Amarillo, both Transgas  (in Massachusetts) and Minnigasco may have at least one. Moreover, PG&E has  one at the end of a long lateral line on its system just south of Sacramento.  Apparently it uses it mostly to augment linepack. The specs of that unit are  about 4 times higher than the Amarillo one: it puts out 400,000 cubic  feet/hour (about 9.6 mmcf/d or almost one contract) at 150 psi. As I said  yesterday, these units are the only way that you could get gas into the  pipeline system in California.   This information I got from Jeff Beale, who runs CH-IV, a small-scale LNG  consultant. He said that he'd had some similar calls about LNG, and also that  he'd be willing to help Enron source equipment if we were really interested  in looking further into transporting LNG into California.   Assuming that we could get a few ""portable pipelines"" and some trucks, there  are five liquefaction plants that could most conveniently supply LNG:  Location Owner  Liquefaction Capacity (gal/day)  Capacity (mmcf/d) Storage  (gal) Storage (mmcf) Topock, AZ ElPaso/ALT 90,000      7.4   100,000  8.2 LaPlata, CO Williams 20,000     1.64   100,000  8.2 Sacramento   57,600     4.72   132,000  10.8 LaBarge, WY Exxon  60,000     4.92       Evanston, WY Amoco  95,000     7.8   100,000  8.2  Totals         26.48  Whether these plants have spare LNG to sell us is another question. The  Sacramento plant, which I mentioned yesterday, is supposedly dedicated to  providing methane for laboratory purposes. The others may have contracts with  LNG fleet owners.   I'll check back with you later today about the outcome of your meeting. ",john.arnold@enron.com,russell.dyk@enron.com,LNG to California,2000-12-12 02:03:00-08:00,received

Unfortunately, that  process has not been finalized and as such, Dutch is not yet an associate.   Ted is finalizing the process this week and it will likely require Dutch to  interview with 4 other commercial managers outside of ENA.    Additionally, there are two other sr. spec. on the gas trading floor in  similar situations and we will be discussing them at a promotion meeting to  be held the first week of Jan.  I would like to handle all of these  consistently and had planned to include Dutch's promotion in this  discussion.

Then it saw a better deal. With California desperate for power and electricity prices hitting unheard-of peaks, Kaiser shut down its two U.S. smelters last week. It is selling the electricity it no longer needs -- for about 20 times what it pays Bonneville under long-standing contracts. It is a measure of this winter's fuel crunch: Some big industrial firms in energy-intensive sectors such as paper, fertilizers, metals and even oil-field operations can make more money by selling their electricity or natural gas than manufacturing their products. The shifts by such large industrial consumers of energy -- described as unprecedented by analysts -- will free up more fuel for households and businesses this winter. But they also are sowing seeds of potential problems next year. Shortages of aluminum and fertilizer, for example, are likely to give another upward jolt to consumer prices and further weaken the economy, analysts said. ""The fertilizer picture is particularly worrying us because we don't know what they're going to use to grow crops with,"" said David Wyss, chief economist at Standard & Poor's. Some economists have recently increased their warnings about the damaging impact of this winter's heating bills on an already weakening economy. Goldman Sachs analysts last week estimated that gas heating bills will double this winter to more than $1,000 for a typical U.S. household. That and higher electricity prices will cost consumers $20 billion in higher energy costs compared with a year ago, they estimated, cutting the expected growth in the nation's economic output by one percentage point on an annual rate in the first three months of next year. ""Overall, the recent energy price developments have thus added to the risk of a sharp economic slowdown,"" the Goldman Sachs report concluded. Terra Industries Inc., in Sioux City, Iowa, has closed three of its six U.S. ammonia plants, which use natural gas as a main ingredient for fertilizer production. Like Kaiser, the company realized it would be much more profitable to stop production in December and sell the natural gas back to the market at current prices, which are much higher than the price Terra was obligated to pay under its existing December supply contract, said Mark Rosenbury, chief administrative officer. ""We looked at these [current] prices and said, 'This is crazy,' "" he said. Terra hasn't disclosed the profit it will make selling its gas, but Rosenbury said it would be ""substantial.""  In coming months, Terra's good fortune could be reversed. It usually buys gas a month at a time, and the prices for January delivery most likely will be well above its break-even point. That would keep Terra's plants closed, Rosenbury said, but eliminate the opportunity to sell the natural gas at a profit. ""If this persists,"" Rosenbury said, ""it's going to be a real problem."" He estimates that out of a total annual U.S. production capacity of 18 million tons of ammonia, about 4 million tons of production isn't operating now. ""Could we be short of fertilizer next spring? It's possible that farmers will not have as much as they want,"" Rosenbury said. Royster-Clark Inc., a Norfolk and New York City-based fertilizer manufacturer and distributor, has shut down its one plant in East Dubuque, Ill., indefinitely, and 72 production workers will be laid off, beginning next month. The story is the same -- natural gas prices are too high to justify continued production. ""We believe it's likely this is a speculative bubble [in natural gas prices] that will burst and in a few weeks we'll be able to buy gas at a more reasonable price, but that remains to be seen,"" said Paul M. Murphy, the company's managing director for financial planning. A continuation of high natural gas prices would likely shrink production and raise fertilizer prices to a point that could affect farmers' decisions to plant feed corn, he said. ""It's sticker shock."" According to Wyss, if this winter remains unusually cold and natural gas remains above $7 per million cubic feet -- double the level a year ago -- farm products could rise significantly a year from now and into 2002. In the aluminum industry, several smaller producers have joined Kaiser, the industry's No. 2 manufacturer, in closing down, noted Lloyd O'Carroll, an analyst with BB&T Capital Markets in Richmond. Aluminum production in November was 8.3 percent below that of November 1999, and December's production will be lower still, he said. ""We'll get more production cut announcements, I think,"" he said. A slowing in the U.S. and world economies next year could ease the impact of reduced aluminum supplies. ""But if the world economy doesn't fall completely apart, then [aluminum] prices are going to rise, and they could rise significantly more than the current forecast,"" he said. In Kaiser's case, it's an open question how much of its electric windfall it will keep. Kaiser is contractually entitled to buy electricity from Bonneville at $22.50 a megawatt per hour, says spokesman Scott Lamb. That is the power it has sold back to Bonneville for $550 a megawatt hour for December. But the Bonneville Authority is pressuring Kaiser to use these and future profits from power resales to compensate employees at the shut-down plants, to invest in new electric generating capacity, or even to refund to Bonneville's other customers, said Bonneville spokesman Ed Mosey. Kaiser and Bonneville have negotiated a new power purchase deal to take effect after next October, but the power authority says it intends to reduce deliveries to Kaiser if the company tries to pocket the electricity sale profits. ""Out here, a deal is a deal, but it has to be a moral deal. There has to be an ethical dimension to this and we're not shy in trying to make sure they live up their advantage in having access to this publicly-owned power,"" Mosey said. , 2000 The Washington Post Company          ",phillip.allen@enron.com,john.arnold@enron.com,Plants Shut Down and Sell the Energy,2000-12-21 23:26:00-08:00,sent

"very useful...thx.   keep me posted     Caroline Abramo@ENRON 12/22/2000 11:41 AM To: John Arnold/HOU/ECT@ECT, Mike Maggi/Corp/Enron@Enron, Jennifer  Fraser/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: Per Sekse/NY/ECT@ECT  Subject: fund views  Hi- all the funds are trying to figure out what the play is for next year-  major divergence of opinions.  Most everyone we talk to takes a macro view.  + Dwight Anderson from Tudor thinks anything above $6 is a sale from the  perspective of shut in industrial demand- he believes that between $6-7 no  industrial (basic industry type) can operate.  He tracks all the plant  closures similar to what Elena does in Mike Robert's group but it seems on a  more comprehensive level (Jen- it would be good for fundamentals to track  this number- do some scenario analysis on it under various economic  conditions- like recession!!).  I will try to find out what his total number  for turned back gas is- just ammonia is a little more than 1/2 Bcf which does  not seem all that meaningful but the total may bring us back into balance for  the summer.  While he's a seller above $6, he'd also be a buyer of summer at lower levels He firmly believes in increased production in 02 (still has 1.1 day short)  based on his relationship with the producing community although I personally  think that 1Q02 sees little.  I know that the fundamentals group is tracking  these numbers from the producing community and has seen no increase in 3q  over 2q and is doubtful for any in 4q over 3q.  He really believes theories on products being out of whack- heat/gas,  crude/propane....  + Jim Pulaski is a bull period- he really likes april and may on the 0  storage scenario- I agree that we try to build storage in April but with the  backwardation out there what is the incentive??? as well, with lower  baseloads for the summer- deliverability should not be an issue.  I am torn  on this one.  + Catequil- new fund- Paul Touradji - used to be with Tiger- they do the same  analysis as Dwight- just starting up and one of their mandates is to be long  nat gas!! through vol or outright.  + Harvard- not really sure of the view yet- they have not been active in gas  just crude/products- they like buying cheap vol- because they do not have MTM  issues- they like to look out in the calendar years.   + The other people we are starting relationships with in the new year are:  Moore Capital, Global Advisors, Caxton, Paloma Partners, Kingdon, Renaissance  (program trader) - just so you know the names- as I get to know them better,  I'll try to fwd on thoughts regularly.

"thx  and have fun on vaca   To: John Arnold/HOU/ECT@ECT cc:   Subject: End of the YEar    Hey: Sorry I didn't get to come by before I left. I have been in London since  12/15.I hope the expiry goes smoothly for you. Also I hope your holliday  season is going well ( however abridged it is by the NYMEX and Enron)  Many of the guys over here asked about nat gas and EOL in the US. I  suggested they visit with you when they are over in the US. In particular,  Chris Mahoney (gasoil trader) will be in Houston the 27 t0 30. I told him he  should come and watch you deal with the AGA number and NX1 at the same time.  Chris is a really good guy. His team loves him and will definitely play a  large role in turning the crude and products group around.    Anyway you were a great pal over the last 12 months and gave me a lot of  good advice. I do miss listening to the banter on the gas floor (and the  gambling!), but there are a lot of good people in crude and products  (especially in London) and I think we will be able to deliver on the goods. I  think you are wonderful and I'm very happy we had the chance to work together.  Happy New Year! Jen  PS I am coming back on the 6th. Once I finish up the week, I am off to Berlin  for New Year's Eve and then a little trip over to Prague.  PPS If there is any other info you need let me know.

"fill me in.  how can i eavesdrop??   To: John Arnold/HOU/ECT@ECT cc:   Subject: Re: NG YEAR ENd Quiz    I belong to a natgas discussion group on the internet. This is from one of  the guys. Basically they are a bunch of gastraders from various firms ( a lot  of producers, some industrials, some small shops and few i--banker types) I  found the test to be mildly amusing. And since I had no idea what 'club no  minors' was-- i was hoping for some insight from you guys. Fortunately, the  lovely Ms. Shipos was able to fill me in.  Anyway, while occasionally garbage, the discussions do provide insight on  what others are thinking of production, storage and other such matters. And  when I was a marketer, I found a few leads. Finally, since a lot of the  information revolves around gossip about a particular 'super trader' at the  big ENE , i find it amusing that one of the most reserved and modest  individuals I know is so talked about on the internet.

"a couple of observations from here: cash/futures getting whacked.  whereas last weekend cash traded $1 over G,  this weekend will probably trade $.15 over.  the lack of weather giving the  market time to regroup.  good thing because another week of cold and the  system was going to break.   certainly still has that chance in feb.  saw  utilities recently staying on a verystrict withdrawal schedule and meeting  any extra demand through spot market.  in effect, they said we're not  withdrawing anymore so we'll buy marketers storage.  they had to encourage  marketers to sell it to them, so cash was extremely strong in periods of even  normal demand and should continue to be if/when any weather comes again.   this week demand so low that utilities can meet demand without buying much in  mkt.  g/h getting whacked in sympathy.   probably priced 25 term deals through broker market  and own originators in  past two days.  24 were from the buy side.  it's as if pira came in and told  everyone term was cheap.  however, they've got the opposite view.  customers  just seeing gas at $4 anytime as being okay now.  don't see any let up in  back support for a while.   front spreads the hardest call right now.  g/h h/j j/k ??? can't decide what  to do with them and from the volatility in them, appears neither can anybody  else.  almost think best play is taking feb gas daily against march, hoping  for a cold spell that breaks the system and get a couple $20+ prints in  cash.  probably as likely to happen in g as h and g/h has much less  downside.    doing well here.  actually having the best month ever 11 days in.  played  front short against term length.  got out of front shorts today.   probably  early but gas has a history of getting off the canvas when least expected.   will keep term length meanwhile.   i've hated summer backwardation forever.   agree about u/h.  a little less crazy about  the trade now because i think  the easy money was made over the past two days.  unbelievable spec demand for  next winter over past week kept summer winter spread constant on rally up and  crushed on move down.  jv/xh went from 22 to 3.5 in 5 days while front  virtually unchanged.  don't know what to think of this summer longer term.  certainly not as easy  as it was last summer when it was obvious $3 was not equilibrium for gas.   now $6 for this summer, i don't know.  we're gonna have to inject the hell  out of gas and keep some demand priced out for a long time.  but we will feel  production increase hit the market.  just buy vol.     slafontaine@globalp.com on 01/11/2001 04:48:32 PM To: slafontaine@globalp.com cc: jarnold@enron.com  Subject: Re: ngas and economy    im getting really bullish mar/may-deliverabulty ayt these propective stx gonna be hampered big time-thyre expensive but im not sure the mkt has a feeling for what gas can do yet with normal weather and implications on the economy-as a real estate owner getting a little scared. ngas is going to wreck morot  gasoline now-watch it go next then maybe heating oil  you doing alrite?

All three models move the main cold trough axis to the Great Lakes area by the last half of the period.  This shift allows for cold Polar/Arctic air to pour into the Midwest and Northeastern states by days 9 and 10 (as early as day 8 on the American).  The Canadian and European continue more troughing in the southern branch in the Southwestern states, keeping that area cool, but also forcing continued ridging in the Southern states--from Texas to the Southeast--keeping them warmer and away from the cold.  The American eliminates this southern branch cold air protection early (by day 8), while the Canadian breaks it down by day 10, implying that even the South would see cold weather at the beginning of the 11-15 day period.  The European appears to hold out the longest in bringing cold air to the South. In all cases, the West Coast should see some gradual warming by late in the period. All three models also continue a very amplified flow pattern in Canada with a plentiful supply of strong, cold air.

Problem is  summer and on out so weak.  trade scale up seller of jv as it gets close to  600.  some customer selling in cal 2.  so h/j and j/k need to blow out  because no other spread is moving.  i'm a seller of j/k so h/j needs to  blow.  all other trade is scale up seller of that so it can move but slowly.   it's a struggle each penny at this point.  at least one spread needs to break  if we're going to run and i don't see that happening.      slafontaine@globalp.com on 02/08/2001 11:20:40 AM To: John.Arnold@enron.com cc:   Subject: Re: spreads    i think we rally a little from here this pm-that said i dont think mar/may  gonna movre up much unless we see cash start to improve.. any thots on east cash?  its a pig-of course no loads. whats gonna be the driver for march/apr from here   you think?    ,slafontaine@globalp.com,john.arnold@enron.com,Re: spreads,2001-02-08 03:53:00-08:00,sent

"Andy: Enjoyed meeting with you.    One more thing I did not address.  My ultimate goal is to move all volume to  EOL.  However, in addition to the NYMEX, we have about 6 other viable  electronic trading systems.  We make it a point to never support these if  possible.  We will only trade if the other system's offer is at or greater  than our bid.  For instance, if we are 6/8 but have a strong inclination to  buy and another system is at 7, I will simultaneously lift their 7's and move  my market to 7/9.  The lesson the counterparty gets is he will only get the  trade if I'm bidding 7 and he will only get executed when it is a bad trade  to him.  People have learned fairly quickly not to leave numbers on the other  systems because they will just get picked off.  If they don't post numbers on  the other systems, the systems get no liquidity and die.  I mention this because I have heard that Enron is a fairly large trader on  Spectron's system.  I don't know whether it is in regards to gas, power, or  metals.  Just something to think about and maybe talk about with the other  traders.

However, with my natural long, I'm not looking to really trade around the position.  I believe ENE will continue to be range bound, but in case it is not, I don't want to forgo 50% of my option premium. I have price targets of where I would like to lighten up exposure to ENE and will use calls to implement the stategy.  To that regards, I noticed I was not approved to sell naked calls.  I would like that ability in order to hedge some exposure I have of unexercised vested options.  Please look into that for me. John.

Of course, you would then be in a position to sell calls again if the stock makes a bounce.  I'm not sure that ENE @ 75 is the place, but maybe @ 73.  Call me if you're interested.

"I think you need to check your AGA model.  7.2 bcf/d seems awfully high.   That's saying that had gas been at $2.5, the AGA for the week would have been  151.  Look at the AGA history for last week, this week and next week.     94 95 96 97 98 99 00 01  3rd week of Feb  -64 -46 -64 -63 -77 -97 -136 -81 4th week of Feb  -132 -118 -62 -76 -47 -128 -74 -101  1st week of Mar  -27 -132 -118 -57 -54 -69 -37 ??  Do you really think the # would have been 151 with no demand destruction?  It  wasn't even really cold.  That would have been the highest AGA # of the three  weeks by 15 bcf.   Our guys are thinking 4.5 bcf/d.  Pira is saying that Feb as a whole averages  3.5-4 bcf/d. That's just destruction and does not include new production, if  any.  Further Pira estimates that March destruction will be about half of  Feb.  Assuming that gets to equilibrium:  2 bcf/d demand destruction, 2 bcf/d  more production, 2 bcf/d more gas generation demand.  Start with a 400 b  deficit and 200 injection days gets you to flat against last years storage in  current price environment.   I think we are fairly priced fundamentally, but  with huge customer imbalance for hedging from buy side, surprises in the  market right now are to the upside in my view.

"so according to your analysis, had we been at $2.5 gas and we were not  bordering on a recession, we would have had the highest AGA number of  recorded history for this week, last week, or next week by 15 bcf?  seems a  little far fetched to me.  Our analysis is saying: gas at 2.50 we would have  had 4.5 bcf a day more demand.  that includes commercial residential  industrial switching processing...     as far as 2 bcf/d  power gen demand- that counts the fact that last year was  extremely mild versus expectation of normal summer this year, west will be  running every gas unit virtually all hours as power demand is growing maybe  5% still and hydro way down.  every molecule that can will flow west from  waha this summer versus little last year.  east power prices really havent  reached point of priceing out demand and heat rates healthy enough to where  gas can go up without raising power prices to cut demand.  some concern of  more efficient replacing less but hard to quantify.  we're trying to build  the stack now to estimate.   frac margins now positive for all but most inefficient processors.  will  continue coming back.  a little concerned about 2 oil prices.  bordering  right there now for places like florida and actually saw fl demand rise  100,000 last week as gas got to parity.   let me look into inj capability.  definitely bigger when field is empty from  engineering standpoint so any problems really wont arise until fall when gen  demand low and inj capacity lower...my initial thoughts. bo seems as neutral as everyone else in the market right now.  really  inactive. to clarify, not raging bull.  i like everybody want to see what the inj  numbers in april look like.  nobody putting a position on until that starts  to clarify.  just think that hedging demand is making market a little short  right now making next move up more likely.  would be scale up seller though not really sure why cash trades at 10-15 back.  doesnt make any sense.   however as more fields start turning around throughout month, the stg arb to  great in my opinion to keep spread there.  must close one way or the other.   notice that spread tightened to 6-8 towards end of trading friday? in general think that gas is reaching the elasticity stage right here.  50  cents lower and no switching, no processing, and gain back some demand.   market needs to see some big stg numbers first.    i think the best play right now is to start buying longer  term put spreads.   Jan 4/3.5 look great to me.  if we get back to 2.8 and don't match last  year's early weather, bombs away.        slafontaine@globalp.com on 03/03/2001 07:03:14 AM To: jarnold@enron.com cc:   Subject: friday    this doesnt allow for new generation demand-which is unclear cuz it requires power px, also doesnt accrue for more eficient gen replacing inneficient, weather of course. but 2bcf/d sounds hi-esp shudnt happen until loads peak in july-shud be marginal in apr-jun    if you notice im not alot diff than your guys-4.6 demand destruction is implied but im including a factor for R/C energy conservation-ie poor guys  like me turning lites off and thermostat down-its making a difference- that will be less factor in shoulder demand months-reason why i think y on y s&d swing will be closer to 5 bcf apr-jun, if px doesnt fall and electricity spikes i think we'll see conservation return cuz i wont turn on my air cnditioner      now rember the 7.4 is vs gas at sub 6.00 ie february which is approx  where we are today     all that being said yes some demand has come back-but it is as i consider extraordinary demand destruction-those things which never really have occured before-like the level for fuel switching in jan and fractionation margins(ie liquids) which were all non existent a year ago save for residual fuel. some ammonia/fert prod  has come back as well. but when you get down to 2 -3 bcf/d industrial in the more i think of it-may not be destruction anymore as mucha unction of an economic slowdown.     anyway -i think i only know two guys that are bearish-me and one of your  big fund customers(ospraie). we'll see.  is collins bullish as well-he seems  quieter in the mkt lately.   heres another one-what you guys think the industry capacity for injection is on a weekly basis? we sud test it...in other words if the max is say 105 then means the basis will uttery colpase on daily cuz mkt will keep futs too hi and be unable to inject all the gas available? thots     also, you any idea why cash at the hub alway seems to hold a 10-15 ct discount lately daily vs next month futs? why not 5 or 30 cts? i dont get it  bt wondering if its transportation or storage cost related.   have a good weekdn my man  ---------------------- Forwarded by Steve LaFontaine/GlobalCo on 03/03/2001 07:38 AM ---------------------------  From: Steve LaFontaine on 03/01/2001 05:01 PM  To:   sulliacd@bc.edu, Terry Sullivan/GlobalCo@GlobalCo cc: Fax to: Subject:  friday  i think you are done with hhd/cdd stuff -ie did you complete the cdds vs utilites demand? also monthly hdds vs residential and commercial demand?(combined)?, cdds vs total stock change??  if all these are done add them to the summary sheet in usable formula  form-ill show you what i mean  then we start our price data base from bloom berg  check this out-using the regression you did for nov-march 99/00 came to a draw of 155 with 195  gw hdds, i decreased the draw by the amount i beleive is the  y on y supply demand swing. ie 1.5 bcf prod                                                   1.1  bcf./d import                                                    3 bcf/d industrial                                                     1.16 fuel switching                                                     .5 ngl neg processing                                                    1.3 r/c conservation                                                 ---------------------------------  =7.4* 7=103 aga came in at 101, so excellant, back testing vs the week prior  cam to 81, vs aga 81!!! nt bad-is a very bearish s&d is this continues cuz says injections will be enoromous in the spring      ",slafontaine@globalp.com,john.arnold@enron.com,Re: friday,2001-03-03 12:10:00-08:00,sent
"So my point shown a little bit right now..  Weather a little cooler for this  week.  Overall normal for 6-10.  JV up 12 cents.  Think just as customers got  totally fucked last year selling into the rally, they are going to buy all  the way down.  Differnence is last year trade very happy to take in all the  length.  This year trade not ready to get really short.  Not until healthy  inj in April anyways.   I think money from here will be made being short,  just question of what and when.  Think there'll be enough hedging demand to  keep curve very strong unless phys market just totally rejects price level.    With amount of inj capacity available, hard to believe phys market is going  to dictate prices for next couple months.  I think it will be spec and  hedgers dictating.  Spec staying on sidelines right now and hedgers buying.   Leads to more upside potential in short term.   My point in V/X was that jv would be strong and cal2 hedging was from sell  side leading to pressure on those spreads.  The california term power sales  have totally changed that.  Before, the only thing customers were selling was  cal 2.  Now, customer interest much more from buyside in cal 2,3 solely from  california.  Now turning neutral v/x and x/z.  You have very valid points.    i like q/v more though.  I think you could have 10 cents of upside in that  with little downside.

By JOSEPH KAHN  03/04/2001 The New York Times Page 4, Column 6 c. 2001 New York Times Company  WASHINGTON -- IN the forensic pursuit of what caused California's power  failure, the Bush administration, the energy industry and many analysts have  granted immunity to deregulation.  Robert Shapiro, a managing director of Enron, the giant electricity marketer,  says the California mess should in no way affect deregulation in other  states, ''because California didn't really deregulate.'' Spencer Abraham, the  new energy secretary, said Californians simply goofed, setting up a  ''dysfunctional'' system. It is the way California deregulated, not  deregulation itself, that should take the blame, they say. Yet some economists argue that California's troubles should inform the debate  about whether -- not just how -- to deregulate. Among them is Alfred E. Kahn,  the Cornell University economist who helped oversee the creation of free  markets in the rail, trucking and airline industries.  ''I am worried about the uniqueness of electricity markets,'' Mr. Kahn said.  He is still studying whether the design flaws in California's market explain  the whole problem. But he is sounding a note of skepticism.  ''I've always been uncertain about eliminating vertical integration,'' he  said, referring to the old ways of allowing a single, heavily regulated power  company to produce, transmit and distribute electricity. ''It may be one  industry in which it works reasonably well.''  Mr. Kahn's comments might sound a little heretical. When this former Carter  administration official was pushing deregulation, it was still a novel and  politically risky concept. Today, getting government out of most businesses  is part of the Washington economic canon.  Moreover, few people believe that California, the first state to overhaul its  electricity sector from top to bottom, has proved a good laboratory. To  satisfy interest groups, the markets were designed in an awkward way, which  soured some deregulation experts on California before the first electron went  on the auction block.  Among the quirks: The state required utilities to buy nearly all their power  on daily spot markets, rather than arranging long-term contracts that might  have allowed them to hedge risk. Consumer prices were also fixed, making it  impossible for utilities to pass on higher wholesale costs.  Paul L. Joskow, an expert on electricity markets at the Massachusetts  Institute of Technology and a former student of Mr. Kahn's, remains hopeful  that the kinks can be ironed out.  In New England and the the Middle Atlantic states, as well in as Britain,  Chile and Argentina, all places that have restructured electricity markets,  regulators have had to adjust market rules to correct flaws. They have found  ways to check the tendency of power sellers to exploit infant markets and  charge high prices, Mr. Joskow said.  Regulators have also had to establish new markets that, through price  signals, encourage power companies to build enough generating capacity so  that they have reserves for peak hours. During peak hours, shortages and  price spikes can substantially raise average prices.  ''If they can do it in Britain, Chile and Argentina, then I think we can do  it here,'' Mr. Joskow said.  Still, he warns that proper regulation requires tough political choices.  Allowing high prices to pass through to consumers is one. Making sure  Nimbyism does not prevent the construction of power plants is another.  ''The political system must rise to the task,'' Mr. Joskow said, or the ''old  way might be the best we can do.''  Mr. Kahn knows a bit about the old way. In the mid-1970's, he headed the New  York Public Service Commission, which oversaw electricity and other regulated  industries. The drawbacks were legendary. Local utilities had an endemic  tendency to overestimate demand to justify new power plants, for which  consumers paid through steady rate increases. Nearly everyone assumed that  competition would slash prices.  But though free markets do a better job managing rail, phone and airline  prices, they have yet to match regulators' ability to juggle the complexities  of electricity, Mr. Kahn said.  Regulators tended to apply heavy political pressure on utilities to keep  prices as low as possible and profit margins steady but thin. The vertical  integration of electricity monopolies may have also had advantages, Mr. Kahn  said. Engineers coordinated power plants and transmission lines in ideal  ways. Planners who saw the need for new plants helped find a place for them  to be built. ''The players all depended on one another,'' he said.  California has probably not derailed deregulation efforts. But it has made  people wonder anew whether market forces work for kilowatts as they do for  widgets.  Photo: Alfred E. Kahn   Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.

The three men have been interviewed by Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, and  the White House was expected to announce next week that it will send their  names to the Senate for confirmation, The Washington Times reported  yesterday, quoting unidentified sources. But two Bush administration sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, told  The Associated Press that President Bush has not made a decision and that the  nominations were not a certainty.  The Times said Gordon England, 63, who retired last week as a vice president  at General Dynamics, would be nominated as Navy secretary. England was  responsible for the company's information systems and international programs.  The newspaper also said James Roche, 61, a vice president at Northrop  Grumman, was the pick to head the Air Force. Roche, a retired Navy captain,  worked in the State Department during the Reagan administration and later was  Democratic staff director for the Senate Armed Services Committee.  The nominee for Army secretary was said to be Thomas White, 57, a retired  Army general and an executive with Enron, a Houston-based energy company.  White was executive assistant to Secretary of State Colin Powell when Powell  was chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.  Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.    NEWS Enron's Chief Denies Role as Energy Villain / Critics regard Kenneth Lay as  deregulation opportunist David Lazarus Chronicle Staff Writer  03/04/2001 The San Francisco Chronicle FINAL A1 (Copyright 2001)  Kenneth Lay is one of the energy ""pirates"" accused by California's governor  of fleecing consumers. As chairman of Enron Corp., the world's largest energy  trader, Lay is arguably the biggest, baddest buccaneer of them all.  But that's not how he wants to be seen. And he certainly doesn't like taking  knocks from Gov. Gray Davis for having contributed to California's energy  mess. ""It's very unfair,"" Lay said, his brown eyes taking on a puppy- dog quality.  ""He's trying to vilify us. But we didn't make the rules in California. We had  nothing to do with creating the problem.""  He gazed out from his plush, 50th-floor office. Houston's downtown  skyscrapers jutted like sharp teeth against the overcast sky.  ""Everyone played by the rules,"" Lay said. ""Now our reputations are being  maligned.""  In a sense, he's right. The ultimate blame does rest with California  policymakers for deregulating the state's electricity market in such a  ham-fisted way that power giants like Enron cleaned up by exploiting  loopholes in the system.  But Enron was no innocent bystander during the restructuring process.  ""Enron and Ken Lay were one of the major players behind the push for  deregulation in California,"" said Janee Briesemeister, senior policy analyst  in the Austin office of Consumers Union. ""A lot of what's happening in  California was their idea.""  Those familiar with the state's deregulation efforts said Enron was  especially eager to ensure that a newly created Power Exchange, where  wholesale power would be bought and sold, was separate from the Independent  System Operator, which would oversee the electricity grid.  ""This fragmented the wholesale market, making it harder to monitor,"" said  John Rozsa, an aide to state Sen. Steve Peace, D-El Cajon, widely regarded as  the godfather of California's bungled deregulation measures.  ""Enron isn't in the business of making markets work,"" Rozsa said. ""They're in  the business of making a buck.""  In an ironic twist, however, Enron now could play a pivotal role in helping  the state remedy past errors and find its energy footing. The company has  that much clout.  SEEKING LAY'S BLESSING  Thus, as the governor pushes ahead with a scheme to purchase the transmission  lines of California's cash-strapped utilities, he didn't hesitate to call  recently seeking Lay's personal blessing for the plan.  This must have been a sweet moment for the man who just weeks earlier had  been castigated by Davis in the governor's State of the State speech.  ""I told him we couldn't support it,"" Lay said, a hint of a smile playing  across his lips. ""It will lead to an even less efficient transmission grid  and, longer term, it could make things worse.""  Why would Davis swallow his pride and court favor with Enron's big cheese?  Simple: Davis will need the Bush administration's backing to make the  power-line sale fly, and, many believe, there's no faster way to reach the  new president than via the Houston office of his leading corporate patron.  Lay, 58, and his company have donated more than $500,000 to Bush's various  political campaigns in recent years, and he placed Enron's private jet at  Bush's disposal during the presidential race.  So great is Lay's influence with the president that some insist he is now  serving effectively as shadow energy secretary, shaping U.S. energy policy as  he sees fit.  ""There's a long history of Enron pulling the levers of its political  relationships to get what it wants,"" said Craig McDonald, director of Texans  for Public Justice, a watchdog group. ""What Ken Lay thinks energy policy  should be isn't very different from what George Bush and Dick Cheney think it  should be.""  ANOTHER VIEWPOINT  Lay, of course, sees things differently. At the mere mention of his close  rapport with the president, his eyes glazed over and he mechanically recited  the words he has repeated numerous times in recent months.  ""I have known the president and his family for many years,"" Lay said. ""I've  been a strong supporter of his. I believe in him and I believe in his  policies.""  He insisted that reports of his having sway over Bush on energy matters are  ""grossly exaggerated.""  Still, it is striking that Bush's quick decision after taking office to limit  federal assistance in solving California's energy woes virtually mirrored  Lay's own thoughts on the situation. So, too, with the administration's  hands-off approach to resolving the crisis.  Whatever else, California's power woes have been very kind to Enron's bottom  line. The company's revenues more than doubled to $101 billion last year.  They haven't hurt Lay, either. According to company records, his pay package  more than tripled last year to $18.3 million.  Lay and other Enron officials steadfastly refuse to break out the company's  California earnings from other worldwide business activities. But Lay  conceded that Enron's profit from California energy deals last year was ""not  inconsequential.""  ""We benefit from the volatility,"" he said.  CAPTIVE MARKETPLACE  That's putting it mildly. It could be said that California's energy mess was  tailor-made for Enron, which is almost uniquely positioned to prosper from a  captive marketplace in which electricity and natural gas prices are  simultaneously soaring skyward.  To understand why that is, one must look closely at Enron's complex business  model. The company is much more than just a middleman in brokering energy  deals.  Lay, with a doctorate in economics and a background as a federal energy  regulator, set about completely reinventing Enron in 1985 after taking over  what was then an unexceptional natural-gas pipeline operator.  As he saw it, the real action was not in distribution or generation of  energy, but in transacting lightning-fast deals wherever electricity or gas  is needed -- treating energy like a tradable commodity for the first time.  Enron is now the leader in this fast-growing field, and uses that advantage  to consolidate its position as the market-maker of choice for energy buyers  and sellers throughout the country.  It also exploits its size and trading sophistication to structure unusually  creative deals. For example, if electricity prices are down but natural gas  prices up, Enron might cut a deal to meet a utility's power needs in return  for taking possession of the gas required to run the utility's plants.  Enron could then turn around and sell that gas elsewhere, using part of the  proceeds to purchase low-priced electricity from another provider, which it  ships back to the original utility.  ""We do best in competitive markets,"" Lay said. ""These are sustainable  markets.""  TRADING FRENZY  Enron's trading floors buzz all day long with frantic activity as mostly  young, mostly male employees scan banks of flat-panel displays in search of  the best deals. Rock music blares from speakers, giving the scene an almost  frat-party atmosphere.  The company's trading volume skyrocketed last year with the advent of an  Internet-based bidding system, which logged 548,000 trades valued at $336  billion, making Enron by far the world's single biggest e-commerce entity.  Kevin Presto, who oversees Enron's East Coast power trades, called up the  California electricity market on his computer. With a few quick mouse clicks,  he showed that Enron at that moment was buying power in the Golden State at  $250 per megawatt hour and selling it at $275.  ""Some days we're at $250, some days $300 and some days $500,"" Presto said  over the steady thump-thump of the trading floor's rock 'n' roll soundtrack.  ""There's truly a problem out there.""  This is a recurring theme among Enron officials: California's electricity  market is broken and Enron would prefer it if things just settled down. As  Lay himself put it, ""The worst thing for us is a dysfunctional marketplace.""  In reality, California's dysfunctional marketplace means Enron isn't just  making piles of money, it's seeing profits both coming and going.  LOTS OF BUSINESS IN CALIFORNIA  The company's energy services division, which handles the complete energy  needs of large institutions, counts among its clients the University of  California and California State school systems, Oakland's Clorox Co., and  even the San Francisco Giants and Pac Bell Park.  Enron purchases electricity on behalf of these clients from Pacific Gas and  Electric Co., which by law must keep its rates frozen below current market  values. At the same time, Enron sells power to PG&E at sky-high wholesale  levels.  In other words, Enron is buying back its own electricity from PG&E for just a  fraction of the price it charges the utility.  ""These guys are the pariahs of the power system,"" said Nettie Hoge, executive  director of The Utility Reform Network in San Francisco. ""Why do we need  middlemen? They don't do anything except mark up the cost.""  To be fair, energy marketers such as Enron can help stabilize an efficient  marketplace by promoting increased competition between buyers and sellers.  This has proven the case in Pennsylvania, where Enron actively trades among  about 200 market participants.  But in an inefficient market such as California, a company like Enron can  easily exacerbate things by exploiting loopholes in the state's ill-conceived  regulatory framework.  Sylvester Turner, a Houston lawmaker who serves as vice chairman of the state  committee that oversees Texas utilities, said he can't blame Enron and other  power companies for pursuing profits in California.  ""California set up some bad rules, and these companies played by the rules  California set up,"" he said. ""At the end of the day, they will behave to  enhance their bottom lines.""  But as Texas proceeds toward deregulation of its own electricity market next  year, Turner said he has learned from California's experience -- and is  taking steps to prevent Texas' power giants from shaking down local  consumers.  LESSONS FROM GOLDEN STATE  He has written a bill intended to give the Texas Public Utility Commission  more authority in cracking down on market abuses. The power companies are  fighting the legislation as hard as they can.  Not least among Turner's worries is that Texas will see what California  officials believe happened in their state: A deliberate withholding of power  by leading providers until surging demand had pushed prices higher.  ""I have that concern,"" he said. ""I don't necessarily take these companies at  their word.""  For his part, Lay insists that Enron has never deliberately manipulated  electricity prices.  ""I don't know of any of that,"" he said. ""It's so easy to conjure up  conspiracy theories.""  As a sign of Enron's commitment to solving California's energy troubles, Lay  said he supported Davis when the state began negotiating long-term power  contracts on behalf of utilities.  So how many contracts has Enron signed?  Suddenly, the hurt, puppyish expression vanished from Lay's face, and a  harder, more steely look glinted from his eyes.  ""None,"" he said. ""We won't be signing until we're certain about recovering  our costs.""  Consider this a shot across California's bow.

SAN FRANCISCO (AP) - Yes, his business has profited handsomely from  California's energy crisis, but Enron Corp. Chairman Kenneth Lay says he  shouldn't be a scapegoat in California's energy crisis.  That hasn't swayed Gov. Gray Davis, who has skewered energy companies such as  Houston-based Enron for selling expensive power to California. ""Never again can we allow out-of-state profiteers to hold Californians  hostage,"" Davis warned in his State of the State address.  More recently, however, Davis called Lay to discuss negotiations as the state  looks to buy power transmission lines from troubled utilities.  ""I told him we couldn't support it,"" Lay told the San Francisco Chronicle in  an interview at his Houston office. ""It will lead to an even less efficient  transmission grid and, longer term, it could make things worse.""  Lay is not just any private-sector energy czar - Enron Corp. is the world's  largest energy trader and Lay is a close friend of President George Bush. Lay  and his corporation have donated more than $500,000 to Bush's various  political campaigns in recent years and he offered Bush use of Enron's  private jet during the presidential race.  But Lay said it's economics, not politics, that matter in California's energy  crisis. And he thinks it unfair that Davis has blamed out-of-state energy  brokers for the protracted problems.  ""We didn't make the rules in California,"" Lay said. ""We had nothing to do  with creating the problem.""  The problem, many analysts agree, began with the state's deregulation of the  power industry in 1996. Enron encouraged deregulation, and the state's  ensuing power crisis has been lucrative for the corporation.  Enron's stock jumped 86 percent in 2000 and its revenues more than doubled to  $101 billion. Lay, 58, was compensated accordingly - he received nearly $16  million in stock and cash beyond his $1.3 million salary last year, compared  with less than $4 million in bonuses in 1999.  Lay refused to say how much Enron has made off California's crisis, though he  conceded the profit was ""not inconsequential.""  ""We benefit from the volatility,"" said Lay, who took over Enron in 1985 and  has helped turn the corporation into a major player in the trading of  electricity as a commodity.  But Lay rejected suggestions that Enron has manipulated prices upward by  insisting California pay dearly for last-minute power that has helped keep  the lights on in recent months.  ""I don't know of any of that,"" he said. ""It's so easy to conjure up  conspiracy theories.""  Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.    BUSINESS NET WORTH The Stadium Curse? / Some stocks swoon after arena deals Kathleen Pender  03/04/2001 The San Francisco Chronicle FINAL B1 (Copyright 2001)  Is buying the name of a big-league stadium the kiss of death for a company,  or does it only seem that way?  From Network Associates Coliseum in Oakland to the unfinished CMGI Field  outside Boston, the nation is dotted with sports venues named after companies  whose stocks have been sacked. The Super Bowl champion Baltimore Ravens play in a stadium named after  PSINet, whose stock has fallen 92 percent to $1.25 a share since it bought  naming rights.  The problem names are not all tech.  The owners of the TWA Dome in St. Louis and Pro Player Stadium in Miami are  looking for new corporate sponsors because their current ones are bankrupt.  TWA is an airline. Pro Player was part of underwear-maker Fruit of the Loom.  The home of the Anaheim Angels could be in the market for a new name if  Edison International, parent of electric utility Southern California Edison,  runs out of juice.  Of course, these companies were not in trouble when they promised to pay tens  or hundreds of millions of dollars to have their names plastered on a  ballpark or arena.  In fact, many were at their peak.  Which begs the question: Should investors get worried when a company in which  they own stock puts its name up among the floodlights?  Brian Pears, head of equity trading with Wells Capital Management, wonders if  companies are susceptible to some weird strain of the ""Sports Illustrated  curse."" It seems as if any athlete who is pictured on the cover of SI  magazine invariably loses his next game or pulls a groin muscle.  Business celebrities suffer from a similar phenomenon: Amazon.com Chief  Executive Officer Jeff Bezos was named Time magazine's 1999 person of the  year just before his company's stock price tanked.  Don Hinchey, who advises buyers and sellers in naming-rights deals, doesn't  think the curse holds true in stadium and arena deals.  ""You can make a case that a company is doing well when it acquires a naming  rights sponsorship, but you can't necessarily say it corresponds with a peak  in its business,"" says Hinchey, director of creative services for the Bonham  Group in Denver.  TRACKING NAMING FIRMS  To find out if Hinchey is right, I tracked the stock market performance of  publicly held companies since they bought naming rights to 47 big-league  sports venues in North America.  I excluded facilities named after subsidiaries of larger companies, including  Miller Park in Milwaukee (Miller Brewing is part of Philip Morris) and Pac  Bell Park in San Francisco (Pacific Bell is owned by SBC Communications,  which is putting its own name on an arena in San Antonio).  I used the announcement date as a starting point because stadium naming deals  are, after all, marketing endeavors. The announcement of a deal generates  tons of publicity, which is considered positive, even if the publicity is  negative and even if the stadium won't open for several years.  Then I compared each company's stock market performance with the Standard &  Poor's 500 index during the same period.  The bottom line: 29 of the 47 companies that bought stadium or arena names  are trading at a higher stock price today than when the deals were announced,  according to data from FactSet Research Systems. (Two companies each bought  two names and were counted twice.)  But -- and this is a big but -- only 13 of them beat the S&P 500 during the  period since their respective deals were announced.  So buying a stadium name might not be a curse, but it's no guarantee the  company will beat the market.  WINNERS, LOSERS  The companies that have done best since buying a name come from a wide  variety of industries.  The biggest winner is Qualcomm, a wireless telecommunications company.  Although its stock is down 65 percent from its peak, it's still up 746  percent since it agreed to slap its name on a San Diego stadium.  The next-biggest winners include Target (discount stores), Ericsson (telecom  equipment), Coors (beer), Fleet Financial (banking), Pepsi (soft drinks) and  Enron (energy).  The biggest losers are TWA, PSINet (Internet service provider), CMGI  (Internet incubator), Savvis Communications (telecom services) and Network  Associates (network security software).  Network Associates' stock peaked about three months after it bought naming  rights to the Oakland Coliseum in September 1998. Since then, it has suffered  a string of setbacks. After the Securities and Exchange Commission questioned  its accounting practices, it restated its financial results for 1997 and  1998. Its CEO resigned in December.  Network Associates is paying slightly more than $1 million per year for the  coliseum name. It can get out of its 10-year deal after five years.  The company ""has been paying us,"" says Deena McClain, general counsel with  the Oakland-Alameda County Coliseum Authority. ""We haven't had any  discussions with them"" about changing the contract.  Most naming-rights contracts have ""out clauses that allow the parties to  extricate themselves if they want, can or need to in the event of financial  difficulties or if a team moves,"" says Hinchey.  Although nobody likes to be associated with a loser, stadium owners may  benefit if a troubled company cuts out of a deal early.  That's because stadium name prices have skyrocketed since the mid- 1990s,  when $1 million a year -- give or take -- was average.  In 1999, FedEx agreed to pay $205 million over 27 years to be named home of  the Washington Redskins.  In 2000, CMGI agreed to pay $114 million over 15 years to have its name on  the new home of the New England Patriots. It's questionable what kind of  shape CMGI will be in when the stadium opens next year.  The ""10-gallon hat of naming rights deals,"" says Hinchey, is in Houston,  where Reliant Energy will pay $300 million over 32 years to name the  Astrodome and a new football stadium after itself.  Some customers of Reliant's utility subsidiary were outraged when the deal  was announced because the company was also raising electricity rates.  Some shareholders also get perturbed when their company spends money on a  stadium instead of a new plant or stock dividends.  But Jim Grinstead, editor of Revenues from Sports Venues, says, ""you have to  look at the (stadium) purchase in light of total marketing budget. It sounds  like big money, but frequently it's over 20 to 30 years. If you take out  things the company might buy anyway, like tickets and luxury suites, it's  small potatoes.""  WHAT A DEAL IS WORTH  The main benefit of a stadium deal is the exposure a company gets when a game  is broadcast on TV or radio or mentioned in print.  ""This is the biggest bang for your buck in terms of branding,"" says Jennifer  Keavney, a Network Associates vice president who negotiated the stadium deal.  She says the cost of her deal, about $1 million a year, ""won't even buy you a  Super Bowl ad. It will buy five commercials on a nationally televised  football game, maybe.""  The Coliseum, perched beside Interstate 880, also acts like a giant billboard  for the company, which frequently gets mentioned in traffic reports.  Hinchey says most naming deals also include tickets and luxury boxes; on-site  exposure through signage and kiosks; premium nights when the sponsor might  offer samples at the park; and inclusion in programs, tickets and flyers.  Most companies that strike stadium deals want to become a household name  because they sell consumer products or services.  But not always.  3Com sold nothing but corporate networking gear when it bought the name to  Candlestick Park in San Francisco in 1995.  ""It was a good move for them,"" says Jim Grinstead, editor of Revenues from  Sports Venues. ""They got the employees they were looking for, the visibility  they were looking for. At the time, they were a player in a crowded field,  and they wanted to look like a fun place to work.""  Last April, 3Com extended its original 4-year contract for two more years.  The biggest risk companies run is that the team that plays in their facility  will be a loser.  ""Companies invest in an entity that can enhance their brand, their sales and  hospitality efforts. Certainly that loses its luster if the team is not  performing well,"" Hinchey says. ""But corporations realize the team's success  on the field fluctuates. It could be a champion one year, next year in the  dumps.""  The same can be said about the corporate sponsors, which is something stadium  owners -- be they taxpayers or business tycoons -- must realize when they  sell a name.

Natural gas demand will also grow at about 2.3 percent this year, the EIA said in its monthly supply and demand report. Natural gas is the third most popular fuel used by U.S. electricity generating plants after nuclear and coal.     U.S. electricity demand in the first quarter of 2001 was forecast at about 896 billion kilowatt hours (kwh), the EIA said. That is slightly higher than the 895.8 billion kwh forecast by the agency last month.     For the entire winter heating season of October through March, electricity demand was forecast to rise by 4.6 percent from the previous year, the EIA said. The increase was driven by the residential and commercial sectors, which were forecst to be higher by 8 and 4 percent, respectively.     More electricity plants were expected to switch from natural gas back to fuel oil as oil prices drift lower, the government report said.     ""This trend is expected to continue through the first quarter 2001,"" the EIA said. ""Although the favorable price differential for oil relative to gas is expected to continue through the forecast period, by the second half of 2001, expected increases in gas-fired capacity are expected to keep gas demand for power generation growing.""     The monthly report also said that mild weather has eased natural gas prices in California, but the state still faces gas supply and deliverability bottlenecks affecting its electricity plants.     California has been fighting all winter to maintain      ",slafontaine@globalp.com,john.arnold@enron.com,Re: eia power demand,2001-03-06 07:08:00-08:00,sent

"confused... what are you disagreeing with me in regards to demand destruction?   From: Jennifer Fraser/ENRON@enronXgate on 03/07/2001 08:55 AM To: John Arnold/HOU/ECT@ECT cc:   Subject: rebuttal  I am definitely a bigger fan of the crude complex for the next few months.  Agree the defcon 5 bubble has burst for natgas. Disagree about the demand  destruction.  ? I think some demand is just permanently gone ( i.3. cheaper BTUs in ASIA-  Pacific and plants just wont run here anymore). But I think that we are  underestimating the structural changes in energy demand. Just as the economy  is less dependent on heavy industry for its health, energy demand is  changing. Since just about everyone missed the boat on the increased power  demand as a result of  Silicon Valley, I think we don't have a good handle on  what the drivers of the new power generation really are.So what i'm saying  is  that industrial demand will weaken, demand in service based industries  will increase. Also energy is a much smaller component of the cost structure  in service industries. ? Also I think in 2000, people had sticker shock-- they couldn't have  imagined 10$ gas, but now that volatility and higher prices are firmly  entrenched in their minds --- they will find ways of running their factories.  Also they will  budget for these prices instead of $2.50 ? See NG Week (3/5/01) Nevada power price hikes affecting casinos ---  increases of 20%. When asked the implication for missed earnings and their  plans for demand conservation, one casino official replied 'We're in the  bright lights business' ? I don't believe the economic doom and gloom  First of all no one wants a repeat of the 1990 recession ( which was much  worse outside of the US) Every central bank in the G7 has or will cut rates  this week. The US will follow suit or it will have a very expensive dollar  which will blow exports. With all of the monetary slack, consumer credit will  not tighten and thus buying will continue ( witness the lack of destruction  in big ticket items purchasing). Heavy manufacturing is contracting but this  is not everything. Productivity gains are strong. The economy is becoming  more service based and traditional industrial barometers are not telling the  whole story. ? Finally, I am London and it is not doom and gloom over here.  well there's my 2 cents.

Reuters English News Service, 03/07/01     Companies People Ideas Family Holding BY Phyllis Berman  03/19/2001 Forbes 102 Copyright 2001 Forbes Inc.  Lemuel Green, a flour mill owner, took the excess power from the water-turn= ed=20 generator at his mill in 1908 and sold it between dusk and midnight to=20 anybody in Alton, Kan. who knew what to do with it. Soon he quit the millin= g=20 business and started stringing transmission lines across the western part o= f=20 the state. Before his death in 1930 he had built a utility that lit 56 Kans= as=20 communities.=20 Kansas City's UtiliCorp United is perhaps the only fourth-generation=20 family-controlled electric utility in the country. Today the outfit, once= =20 called Missouri Public Service, is headed by Lemuel Green's two=20 great-grandsons. Richard Green, 46, took over as chief executive in 1985, three years after= =20 his father's death. At the time Missouri Public Service served 200,000=20 customers in two states and had $245 million in revenues. Richard's brother= =20 Robert, now 39, joined him three years later.=20 Standing pat was not an option. Deregulation was in the air, and the rules= =20 were changing. The brothers remade the company. They spent $4 billion buyin= g=20 utilities in other parts of the U.S., Canada, Australia and New Zealand.=20 UtiliCorp now serves 4 million customers in seven states and four countries= .=20 More important, they veered off into other parts of the energy business. In= =20 1986 they acquired gas properties from Peoples Natural Gas of Omaha and got=  a=20 two-person gas-trading operation as part of the deal. That little trading= =20 operation, now a subsidiary called Aquila, turned into something almost as= =20 valuable as all the rest of the company, with its 4,500 megawatts of power= =20 generated in some 22 power plants around the country.=20 ""My brother and I received strong advice that we would never be able to be= =20 competitive in this business,"" says Bob Green. Oh, yeah? Aquila has 1,100= =20 employees and competes with the likes of Duke, Dynegy and Enron. According = to=20 Natural Gas Week, Aquila was the fourth-largest power-and-gas marketer in t= he=20 country last year. Aquila trades a host of other products as well-everythin= g=20 from weather-condition hedges to bandwidth.=20 Problem: Trading operations require capital just as power plants do. The=20 solution, until now, has been what brother Bob calls ""our 'asset lite'=20 strategy. We want to control the capacity, not own it."" So Aquila may provi= de=20 the gas to power a so-called merchant plant, one that produces electricity = to=20 sell in the market, in return for a claim on its production. But so far=20 Aquila has not been a big player in the most profitable parts of the=20 business-taking on big risk in larger transactions, the way Enron and Dyneg= y=20 do.=20 What to do? In mid-December UtiliCorp announced that it would offer 19.9% o= f=20 Aquila to the public, raising capital while creating a market value for its= =20 trading operation, just as competitors Constellation Energy and Southern=20 Company are doing. The hope is that the new entity will garner a multiple o= f=20 20 to 45 times earnings. Then, if all were to go as planned, UtiliCorp woul= d=20 spin off the rest of the operation in a tax-free distribution.=20 The timing looks good. Aquila has no material exposure in the California=20 market. Furthermore, the volatility in that market has been a bonanza for= =20 many firms that trade power, including Aquila. Its trading subsidiary is th= e=20 reason UtiliCorp's earnings were up 28% last year, to $206 million, on $29= =20 billion in sales. UtiliCorp's shares doubled in the past year to $30.=20 But will the California crisis nonetheless poison the market for an Aquila= =20 stock offering? It might. And UtiliCorp cannot afford to hold its breath in= =20 the capital markets forever. Even with its ""asset-lite"" strategy, the compa= ny=20 is far more leveraged than most utilities, with debt at 56% of capital,=20 versus the 50% norm for electric utilities. The offering is supposed to rai= se=20 $425 million or so that could be used to pay down a bit of the parent's $2.= 9=20 billion in debt.=20 If Bob Green is walking a financial tightrope, you could never tell it by= =20 talking to him. ""We see this company as our heritage,"" he says confidently.= =20 This despite the fact that after seven equity offerings the family's share = of=20 UtiliCorp is now 4%, down from 15% when Richard took over.=20 Might the Greens lose their heirloom in a takeover battle? They might, but= =20 they might come out ahead anyway. Look at the family history. Lemuel sold= =20 some of his utility assets for $6.6 million in 1927 and diversified into=20 California orange groves. The assets were resold to Samuel Insull, the=20 midwestern electricity magnate who came to a bad end when his pyramid of=20 holding companies collapsed during the Depression. Years later, after=20 Congress reacted with a law that busted up multistate electric utilities, B= ob=20 and Rick's grandfather bought back Lemuel Green's utility properties for a= =20 song.

Two years ago, Bradley Hoggatt was heading for an academic career in=20 meteorology, intent on discovering more about how hurricanes form.

""I'm putting my money where m= y=20 mouth is,"" says the tall, square-shouldered 28-year-old.=20 Weathermen and women have become a hot commodity in the exploding=20 energy-trading business. While off-target forecasts on television may=20 frustrate parents and schools and embarrass politicians, as they did this= =20 week on the East Coast, they can lose bundles for electricity and natural-g= as=20 traders. So as trading has boomed, so has demand for trained meteorologists= ,=20 a profession that traditionally hasn't paid all that well and is often the= =20 butt of jokes.=20 From Wall Street to Houston's Louisiana Street, where many energy companies= =20 have set up shop, recent graduates are earning twice what they would earn a= t=20 the National Weather Service or in academia. ""The appetite for weather is= =20 insatiable,"" says James L. Gooding, director of meteorology at Duke Energy= =20 Corp. A former NASA scientist, Dr. Gooding will be adding a fourth forecast= er=20 to his Houston team in the next year.=20 Enron Corp., an energy-trading giant based in Houston, has more than double= d=20 its staff of weather forecasters to nine in the past three years, plucking= =20 talent from places like the Weather Channel. Williams Cos., a Tulsa, Okla.,= =20 competitor, is endowing university fellowships to lure meteorology students= .=20 And since 1999, Aquila, which is owned by UtiliCorp United Inc., of Kansas= =20 City, Mo., has hired two other meteorologists from Mr. Hoggatt's alma mater= ,=20 the University of Wisconsin, plus another scientist with a Ph.D. in=20 climatology.=20 That hiring paid off a bit during this week's winter storm in the Northeast= .=20 While many on the East Coast were getting miscues from TV weathermen on a= =20 pending, possibly historic blizzard that fizzled in New York and other=20 cities, traders at Aquila simply looked to Mr. Hoggatt.=20 Last Friday, Scott Macrorie, an electricity trader for the Mid-Atlantic=20 region at Aquila, stopped by to see how the storm was progressing. Mr.=20 Hoggatt's team told him temperatures in his region of interest would be low= er=20 because of the storm, though the snowfall forecast on TV seemed a little=20 high. Sure enough, temperatures fell and snowfall in many cities was less= =20 than predicted, lifting electricity prices and making Mr. Macrorie a profit= =20 that he says was in the tens of thousands of dollars.=20 About 500 university students in the U.S. graduate each year with bachelor'= s=20 degrees in meteorology, according to the American Meteorological Society. A= n=20 additional 300 or so graduate with masters degrees or doctorates. Until jus= t=20 a few years ago, those graduates didn't typically have many options: TV for= =20 those who had the blow-dried look, back-office jobs with the government or = a=20 handful of private consultants for those who didn't. Research was an option= .=20 And some airlines and utilities kept a few meteorologists on staff to help= =20 position airplanes or power-line repair trucks during storms.=20 Now, deep-pocketed trading companies are offering many meteorologists with= =20 graduate degrees salaries ranging from $60,000 to $90,000. Performance and= =20 trading bonuses can double or even triple the figure. That compares with th= e=20 roughly $33,000 the National Weather Service pays a junior forecaster with = a=20 graduate degree.=20 ""It's a bit unusual for meteorologists to have the prospect of lucrative=20 employment after graduation,"" says John Nielsen-Gammon, a professor of=20 atmospheric sciences at Texas A&M University. ""This is a bit of a switch.""= =20 So far, there has been no dearth of meteorological talent available, partly= =20 because the National Weather Service wrapped up a big expansion project in= =20 the mid-1990s and slowed hiring. It hires only to replace people who leave,= =20 about 30 to 50 meteorologists a year.=20 And the high-pressure world of billion-dollar commodity bets isn't for=20 everyone. When Carl Altoe graduated from Penn State, one of the nation's to= p=20 meteorology programs, he got a heavy sales pitch from Enron. ""It's quite an= =20 impressive place,"" he says of Enron's trading floor, but he wasn't sure=20 forecasting skills alone would be enough to make the grade. ""I would be=20 afraid that if money wasn't made in a hurry, I'd be tossed,"" says Mr. Altoe= ,=20 who accepted a position with the National Weather Service in Marquette, Mic= h.=20 For others, having forecasts count puts a new thrill in the old art.

Meanwhile, all sorts of companies are turning to= =20 energy traders and Wall Street for ""weather derivatives,"" complex contracts= =20 used to hedge financial risks associated with the weather. ""With every=20 passing year, you do more energy and more energy,"" Mr. Davis says.=20 Despite big advances in data collection and modeling, betting millions of= =20 dollars on weather forecasts can still be tricky business.

""I call it the forecast bakeoff,"" says Mr. Hoggatt.=20 The high stakes also mean more pressure on forecasters.

The release was not confirmed by the sender.)  ENRON AND MANX ELECTRICITY ANNOUNCE POWER TRADING AGREEMENT       London, March 8 -- Enron announced today that it has concluded a long-term power trading agreement with the Manx Electricity Authority (MEA), representing one of the first deals with an embedded generator specifically designed for the New Electricity Trading Arrangements (NETA). Under the agreement Enron will provide 24-hour trading services to MEA under NETA in an innovative deal structured to maximise the value of the electricity interconnector between the Isle of Man and UK mainland.      The =01A45 million interconnector runs between Bispham in Lancashire and Douglas on the Isle of Man and is capable of carrying 40MW in each direction. At 105km it is the longest AC interconnector cable in the world.      ""The development costs of the interconnector to the UK placed us under pressure to put the link to the highest and best economic use and we feel our relationship with Enron has accomplished this"" said Mike Proffitt, Chief Executive of MEA.      ""Our commitment to reducing the price of electricity on the Isle of Man is firmly embedded in MEA's five year plan and our trading partnership with Enron will greatly assist us in achieving this goal.""      Richard Lewis, Managing Director of UK gas and power at Enron, commented: ""This is a great transaction for both parties and fits well into Enron's trading portfolio. MEA will benefit from Enron's expertise as one of the UK's leading energy traders and will provide us with their skills as operators of their generation plant and the interconnector. It is significant in that we believe it is one of the first embedded generation transactions specially tailored for the new trading arrangements.""

Weather affects commodities trading and determines electricity and natural gas supply and demand. That's why large energy trading companies like Enron Corp., Williams Cos. and UtiliCorp United Inc. recruit top weather-forecasting talent, the paper said. Meteorologists with graduate degrees can command $60,000 to $90,000 a year, far higher than the $33,000 the National Weather Service pays a junior staffer.      Energy traders use in-house weather forecasts to make quick bets on the direction of electricity and natural gas prices. Fast and accurate predictions can earn huge profits, the paper said.      Many meteorologists say they like the pace and action of the trading floor. While some in the profession work in broadcasting, most meteorologists labor in the less visible and action-oriented worlds of academia or government research, the paper said.

"Andy: Good to hear.  There continue to be a proliferation of new systems coming  online in the US; two more start in the next two months.  We are pretty close  to finalizing a plan to open our system to everyone in terms of accepting  limit orders and posting best bid/offer regardless of whose it is.  In this  framework, Enron would sleeve credit for free should two third parties be  matched on our system.  However, we would hold the book, getting to see what  everyone was doing at all times.  The idea is that if we can move the  industry's order flow from 30-40% EOL to 60% EOL, we get a huge information  advantage in addition to a couple trading advantages, namely we have first  priority on all numbers even if we are joining a limit bid posted by a  counterparty before us and second, we posess a proprietary stack manager that  will allow us to transact on attractive limit orders faster than our  competitors.  Still working on technical issues.  The decision to open EOL  markets would be done on a product by product basis.  Give me a call if you  want to discuss.     Andrew Fairley 03/13/2001 11:14 AM To: John Arnold/HOU/ECT@ECT cc:   Subject: Re: Trip to Houston     John  Redmond & I have now had a few weeks to implement some of your advice with  regard to EOL for UK gas. We have managed to double our average daily volumes, and are capturing a  considerably greater share of the market. (We estimate 50% now). Spectron are getting about 20-30% of the number of trades we do. There are  still some counterparties who insist on paying through our numbers and paying  brokerage so they do not show us what we are doing!  As far as we are  concerned we only use SpectronLive on UK gas when we are  executing the  strategy you mentioned below.   Once again, thanks for your help All the best,  Andy      John Arnold 21/02/2001 04:26 To: Andrew Fairley/LON/ECT@ECT cc:    Subject: Re: Trip to Houston    Andy: Enjoyed meeting with you.    One more thing I did not address.  My ultimate goal is to move all volume to  EOL.  However, in addition to the NYMEX, we have about 6 other viable  electronic trading systems.  We make it a point to never support these if  possible.  We will only trade if the other system's offer is at or greater  than our bid.  For instance, if we are 6/8 but have a strong inclination to  buy and another system is at 7, I will simultaneously lift their 7's and move  my market to 7/9.  The lesson the counterparty gets is he will only get the  trade if I'm bidding 7 and he will only get executed when it is a bad trade  to him.  People have learned fairly quickly not to leave numbers on the other  systems because they will just get picked off.  If they don't post numbers on  the other systems, the systems get no liquidity and die.  I mention this because I have heard that Enron is a fairly large trader on  Spectron's system.  I don't know whether it is in regards to gas, power, or  metals.  Just something to think about and maybe talk about with the other  traders.

"Looks good.  certainly an area we need more focus on.  Obviously the most  important aspect of lng is how much gas is coming in, what is that relative  to last year, and what new capacity is coming longer term.   As an aside, nat gas trades as a funciton of the storage spread to last year  and five year averages.  It would be very useful if all fundamental analysis  were geared the same way.  The fact that lng shipments are x this week is  meaningless.  the fact that they are y delta of last year is extremely  useful.  if you noticed in the fundies meeting, i was trying to move  discussion that way.  what's switching vis a vis last year.   whats  production relative to last year.  it simplifies the fundamental analysis.

Warming Up To Green  BY ERIC ROSTON  Breathe in. Hold it. Hold it. O.K., now breathe out.  Unless you're outdoors in the midst of a cold snap, chances are you can't see your breath. And no one would ever ask you to drop a quarter in a tin box for the right to free this invisible spirit from your lungs. Yet last November, Murphy Oil Corp., based in El Dorado, Ark., voluntarily shelled out several hundred thousand dollars for the right to cough out carbon dioxide, the same stuff you exhaled three sentences ago.  The reason it did so is closely related to events that occurred that same autumn day, half a world away, at the Hague. Thousands of policymakers and scientists from all over the world had gathered, hoping to dot the i's, cross the zeds and umlaut the o's on the 1997 Kyoto Protocol to the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change. The protocol was devised to curb the industrial emission of six gases, CO2 among them, that are slowly--actually quickly in geological terms--turning the earth into a hothouse. But no final accord was reached.  In this context, Murphy's purchase of options on 210,000 metric tons of carbon (the equivalent of annual exhaust from approximately 27,800 cars) from a Canadian company that was itself trying to help meet a national target seems a bit odd. The market for this kind of trade hasn't been established, and there isn't even a global agreement on how carbon dioxide should be valued. Indeed there isn't even unanimity on global warming itself.  Yet the transaction is emblematic of industry on the verge of an environmental transition. Congress may have snubbed the Kyoto accord, and global bureaucrats may be stumbling over the details of a carbon-emissions trading system. But corporations, against the run of play, are beginning to confront the climate conundrum the best way they know how--as a business opportunity. John Browne, CEO of BP Amoco, and Mark Moody-Stuart, chairman of Royal Dutch/Shell Group, have both responded to the global-warming threat and set up internal systems that exceed goals put forth in Kyoto. Shell and BP have vowed to cut their greenhouse-gas emissions 10% each--nearly twice the Kyoto target--Shell by 2002, BP by 2010. ""This isn't an act of altruism,"" says Aidan Murphy of Shell. ""It's a fundamental strategic issue for our business.""  And not theirs alone. A growing number of corporations, from IBM to your neighborhood Kinko's, are reducing their greenhouse footprints. DuPont is pledging to knock its emissions 65% below 1990 levels by 2010. ""There's been a shift in the center of gravity in the U.S. corporate community since Kyoto,"" says Alden Meyer of the Union of Concerned Scientists. ""Now the view is that climate change is serious and we ought to do something about it.""  There are a few ways of doing that: invest in renewable energy sources and ""cap and trade"" emissions. That is, set ceilings for worldwide greenhouse-gas emission and let nations either sell emission credits if they emit below their allowance or buy credits if they exceed permitted levels. The theory is that the pursuit of greenbacks will fuel greener business. ""Whenever you turn a pollution cut into a financial asset,"" says Joseph Goffman, an attorney at Environmental Defense, ""people go out and make lots of pollution cuts.""  Even where green fervor is of a paler shade, corporations are viewing the potential for global regulation as a business risk they need to consider. Witness Claiborne Deming, Murphy's CEO, who doesn't see the science of global warming as solid enough yet to cry havoc. But Deming hears shareholders clamoring and the bureaucrats buzzing. Someone may ask his company to put more than a quarter in that box when it wants to exhale more than its allotted amount of CO2.  Breathe in. Hold it. You know the drill.  How much CO2 did you just exhale? Tricky question. Yet that's analogous to the one businesses are struggling with on a massive scale. Until they figure it out, companies interested in trading will be on their own to determine 1) how you buy the right to emit a gas that has no standard of measurement and 2) how to do so when no nation currently assigns a CO2 property right. ""It's risky as hell,"" says Deming.  Many groups are working to mitigate that risk. The World Resources Institute and others are road-testing a system that would make trading less risky by creating universal carbon-accounting practices. And four companies--Arthur Andersen, Credit Lyonnais, Natsource and Swiss Re--are developing an exchange where companies can trade, even in an embryonic market devoid of legislative standards. ""They're trying to nail down something that will be useful under laws that are not yet defined,"" says Garth Edward, a broker at Natsource, an energy-trading firm.  The U.S. struggled to introduce a cap-and-trade system into the Kyoto Protocol, and achieved it by agreeing to a tough, many say impossible, target: bringing emissions 7% below 1990 levels from 2008 to 2012. The irony of the current situation is that the Europeans, reluctant to accept trading at first, have become its champion; Britain next month will become the first country to embark on a national trading system.  Another practice, still hotly debated, is to assign credits for sequestering carbon in growing forests. Trees soak up limited amounts of CO2, release oxygen into the air and turn carbon into wood.  The Kyoto mechanisms will evaporate without global ratification, thus setting up an early environmental test for President Bush, who campaigned against the document. But Secretary of State Colin Powell has already heard preliminary briefings on the matter as the U.S. preps for the next round of talks, to be held in Bonn in mid-July. Bush the First helped pioneer credit trading in 1990, when he signed legislation that capped power plants' sulfur dioxide emissions--the main ingredient in acid rain--but allowed the plants to swap credits. And Houston-based Enron, an energy trader whose chairman, Ken Lay, was a prominent W. campaign adviser, stands to be a huge player in any such market. So if it's good for business, Bush the ex-businessman won't need that big a push.  With him or without him, the monetization of carbon emissions--green for greed's sake, if nothing else--is gaining momentum. So breathe easy. For you, it's still free. But for many companies, the carbon meter will be running soon. In the very near future, pollution is going to be either a cost to them or an opportunity.

It would be great if you could respond  to this with two or three questions that you've used in the past to select  good Gas Traders.  Thanks for your help.

"unfortunately, mathematical analysis of skew is extremely hard to do.  the  question is why does skew exist and does the market do a proper job of  correcting for violations of the black scholes model.  in my mind, there are  three big reasons for skew.  one is that the assumption of stochastic  volatility as a function of price level gets violated.  commodities tend to  have long range trading ranges that exist due to the economics of supply and  elasticity of the demand curve.  nat gas tends to be relatively stable when  we are in that historical pricing environment.  however, moving to a  different pricing regime tends to bring volatility.  an options trader wants  to be long vol outside the trading range, believing that a breakout of the  range leads to volatility while trying to find new equilibrium.  supports a  vol smile theory.  in addition, in some commodities realized vol is a  function of price level.  nat gas historically is more volatile at $5 than at  $4 and more volatile at $4 than $3.  thus there has been a tendency for all  calls to have positive skew and all puts except weenies to have negative  skew.  the market certainly trades this way as vol has a tendency to come off  in a declining market and increase in a rising market.  to test, regress 15  day realized vol versus price level and see if there is any correlation.   second reason is heptocurtosis, fatter tails than lognormal distribution  predicts.  supports vol smile theory.  easy to test how your market compares  by plotting historical one day lognormal returns versus expected  distribution.   third, is just supply and demand.  in a market where spec players are  bearish, put skew tends to get bid as vol players require more insurance  premium to add incremetal risk to the book.  if you have a neutral view  towards market, or believe that market will come off but in an orderly  fashion, enron can take advantage of our risk limits by selling more  expensive insurance.  crude market tends to have strong put skew and weak  call skew as customer business in options is nearly all one way: producer  fences.  if you believe vol is stochastic in the region of prices where the  fence strikes are, can be profitable to take other side of trade.   if you want to discuss further give me a call 4-6 pm houston time.  hope this  helps, john     Sharad Agnihotri 04/04/2001 12:44 PM To: Mike Maggi/Corp/Enron@Enron, John Arnold/HOU/ECT@ECT cc:   Subject: Gas Implied Volatility Smile  John, Mike  I work for the London Research team and am looking at  some option pricing problems for the UK gas desk.

Agree - Products Rally is not different for products. 92% of heating oil is made ondemand   (storage is not as important as in nat gas) Heat will get ugly this October  and then give it up (unless we have 7 blizzzards in the Northeast very  early).  SOme things to consider : 1- in the next 3-4 weeks we will finish the very heavy maintenance season and  be in full blown gasoline season. - yields will be preferentially shifted for HU 3- nobody will pay any attention to HO 2-HO will have incremental demand due to utlity switching and will quietly  build slower than last year  4- therefore by September everyone will freak out 5- After the OCtober contract expires (HO) , everyone will realize (similar  to NG) that the world will not end.  Where does this get us: 1- Sell q3 HU crack and by Q4HO crack (By the time q3 prices out--the wind  will have been taken out of HU sails - plus you can do it month  avg--therefore less noise) 2-Benefit from heat's recent excitement -- sell HO calls (June -Aug), buy ng  puts nov-jan  Ng-Disagree: I think prices stay high through June. The big drop off come some where in  July 15 to Aug 15 and downhill from there.

"1.   don't know.  some industrial shutdown is not gas price dependent.  some will not come back at the same prices it went off.  residential conservation i think is underestimated and has a severe lag effect that will not come back as prices fall.  as far as switching i dont think #2 is the floor some people think it is.  maybe #6 is the floor. 2.  you know my outlook for xh,  with slightly above normal weather jan goes out at 2.75 and that is not constrained by a #6 floor.  next jv, too far away to really run the numbers but think natty reestablishes itself as a $2.50-3.50 commodity.   3. the obvious 4. yes.  believe if we end at 2.6 in the ground, the current nymex forward curve may be fairly priced.  my belief is that at the current prices we will end up with much more than 2.6 and that $5 is not value if we have 2.8 in the ground and gaining y on y.  circular argument that leads to my belief that prices must fall. 5.  not necessarily.  will loss of demand with normal weather cancel the fact that there will be much less demand destruction.  probably.

It gives perspective on 'normal relationships'.   Things I need to clarify about your ng view 1- As gas plummets are you assuming that it regains all demand (industrial shutdowns and fuel switchers)? 2-What is your outlook for Nov-Mar 01 and Ap-oct 02 3- How does your view change with a normal, cold or warm winter ? 4- Is your view predicated on getting to 2.6  is easy and that world did not end this past winter a storage level of 2.6? 5- Do you believe that we will need to price some demand out again this winter?

Wolkoff, Executive Vice President  RE: Implementation of New NYMEX Rule 9.11A (""Give-Up Trades"")  DATE: May 7, 2001 =========================================================== Please be advised that beginning on the trade date of Friday, June 1, 2001, new NYMEX Rule 9.11A (""Give-Up Trades"") will go into effect.  !    In the absence of an applicable give-up agreement, new Rule 9.11A will define the respective responsibilities/obligations to an order of executing brokers, customers and Clearing Members.  !    The term ""executing broker"" as used in Rule 9.11A refers to the registered billing entity, Member Firm or Floor Broker to whom the order is transmitted.  !    Rule 9.11 will provide that, in the absence of an applicable give-up agreement, a Clearing Member may reject a trade only if: (1) the trade exceeds trading limits established by the Clearing Member for that customer that have been communicated to the executing broker as provided by the rule or (2) the trade is an error for which the executing broker is responsible.  !    The new rule also places affirmative obligations on executing brokers to confirm Clearing Member authorization for an account.  For example, prior to an executing broker accepting and executing an initial order for any new customer account, such executing broker must confirm with the Clearing Member by telephonic, electronic or written means, that: (a)  the customer has a valid account with the Clearing Member; (b)  the account number; (c)  the brokerage rate; (d)  the customer is authorized by the Clearing Member to place orders with the executing broker for that account; and (e)  a listing or summary of persons authorized to place orders for that account. Moreover, the executing broker must retain a copy of the authorization or the specifics of the telephonic confirmation, which includes: opposite party, date, time, and any other relevant information.  The Compliance Department will conduct periodic audits of such records, and falsification of such information shall be the basis for disciplinary action.   If you have any questions concerning this new rule, please contact Bernard Purta, Senior Vice President, Regulatory Affairs and Operations, at (212) 299- 2380; Thomas LaSala, Vice President, NYMEX Compliance Department, at (212) 299-2897; or Arthur McCoy, Vice President, Financial Surveillance Section, NYMEX Compliance Department, at (212) 299-2928,  NEW RULE 9.11A (""Give-Up Trades"")  (Entire rule is new.)  Rule 9.11A     Give-Up Trades  In the absence of a give-up agreement whose terms and conditions govern the responsibilities/obligations of executing brokers, customers and Clearing Members, the following rules shall define the respective responsibilities/obligations of those parties to an order.  The ""executing broker"", as used in this rule, is the registered billing entity, Member Firm or Floor Broker to whom the order is transmitted.  (A)    Responsibilities/Obligations of Clearing Members  (1). Limits Placed by Clearing Member.   A Clearing Member may, in its discretion, place trading limits on the trades it will accept for give-up for a customer's account from an executing broker, provided however, that the executing broker receives prior written or electronic notice from the Clearing Member of the trading limits on that account.  Notice must be received by the executing broker in a timely manner.  A copy of such notice shall be retained by the Clearing Member.  (2). Trade Rejection.  A Clearing Member may reject (""DK"") a trade only if: (1) the trade exceeds the trading limits established under Section I(A) of this rule for that customer and it has been communicated to the executing broker as described in Subsection (A); or (2) the trade is an error for which the executing broker is responsible.  If a Clearing Member has a basis for rejecting a trade, and chooses to do so in accordance with the provisions of Rule 2.21(B), it must notify the executing broker promptly.  (3). Billing.  A Clearing Member will pay all floor brokerage fees incurred for all transactions executed by the executing broker for the customer and subsequently accepted by the Clearing Member by means of the ATOM system. Floor brokerage fees will be agreed upon in advance among the Clearing Member, customer and the executing broker.  (B)  Responsibilities/Obligations of Executing Brokers  (1)  Customer Order Placement.  An executing broker will be responsible for determining that all orders are placed or authorized by the customer.  Once an order has been accepted, a broker or the broker's clerk must:  (a)  confirm the terms of the order with the customer; (b)  accurately execute the order according to its terms; (c)  confirm the execution of the order to the customer as soon as practicable; and (d)  transmit such executed order to the Clearing Member as soon as practicable in accordance with Exchange Rules and procedures.  2.   Use of Other Persons.  Unless otherwise agreed in writing, the executing broker is allowed to use the services of another broker in connection with the broker's obligations under these rules.  The executing broker remains responsible to the customer and Clearing Member under these rules.  3.    Executing Broker Responsibility for Verifying Clearing Member Authorization.  Prior to a broker accepting and executing an initial order for any new customer account, the executing broker must confirm with the Clearing Member by telephonic, electronic or written means, that: (f)  the customer has a valid account with the Clearing Member; (g)  the account number; (h)  the brokerage rate; (i)  the customer is authorized by the Clearing Member to place orders with the executing broker for that account; and (j)  a listing or summary of persons authorized to place orders for that account. The executing broker must retain a copy of the authorization or the specifics of the telephonic confirmation, which includes: opposite party, date, time, and any other relevant information.  The falsification of such information shall be the basis for disciplinary action.  4.   Rejection of Customer Order.

Wolkoff, Executive Vice President  RE: Implementation of New NYMEX Rule 9.11A (""Give-Up Trades"")  DATE: May 7, 2001 =========================================================== Please be advised that beginning on the trade date of Friday, June 1, 2001, new NYMEX Rule 9.11A (""Give-Up Trades"") will go into effect.  !    In the absence of an applicable give-up agreement, new Rule 9.11A will define the respective responsibilities/obligations to an order of executing brokers, customers and Clearing Members.  !    The term ""executing broker"" as used in Rule 9.11A refers to the registered billing entity, Member Firm or Floor Broker to whom the order is transmitted.  !    Rule 9.11 will provide that, in the absence of an applicable give-up agreement, a Clearing Member may reject a trade only if: (1) the trade exceeds trading limits established by the Clearing Member for that customer that have been communicated to the executing broker as provided by the rule or (2) the trade is an error for which the executing broker is responsible.  !    The new rule also places affirmative obligations on executing brokers to confirm Clearing Member authorization for an account.  For example, prior to an executing broker accepting and executing an initial order for any new customer account, such executing broker must confirm with the Clearing Member by telephonic, electronic or written means, that: (a)  the customer has a valid account with the Clearing Member; (b)  the account number; (c)  the brokerage rate; (d)  the customer is authorized by the Clearing Member to place orders with the executing broker for that account; and (e)  a listing or summary of persons authorized to place orders for that account. Moreover, the executing broker must retain a copy of the authorization or the specifics of the telephonic confirmation, which includes: opposite party, date, time, and any other relevant information.  The Compliance Department will conduct periodic audits of such records, and falsification of such information shall be the basis for disciplinary action.   If you have any questions concerning this new rule, please contact Bernard Purta, Senior Vice President, Regulatory Affairs and Operations, at (212) 299- 2380; Thomas LaSala, Vice President, NYMEX Compliance Department, at (212) 299-2897; or Arthur McCoy, Vice President, Financial Surveillance Section, NYMEX Compliance Department, at (212) 299-2928,  NEW RULE 9.11A (""Give-Up Trades"")  (Entire rule is new.)  Rule 9.11A     Give-Up Trades  In the absence of a give-up agreement whose terms and conditions govern the responsibilities/obligations of executing brokers, customers and Clearing Members, the following rules shall define the respective responsibilities/obligations of those parties to an order.  The ""executing broker"", as used in this rule, is the registered billing entity, Member Firm or Floor Broker to whom the order is transmitted.  (A)    Responsibilities/Obligations of Clearing Members  (1). Limits Placed by Clearing Member.   A Clearing Member may, in its discretion, place trading limits on the trades it will accept for give-up for a customer's account from an executing broker, provided however, that the executing broker receives prior written or electronic notice from the Clearing Member of the trading limits on that account.  Notice must be received by the executing broker in a timely manner.  A copy of such notice shall be retained by the Clearing Member.  (2). Trade Rejection.  A Clearing Member may reject (""DK"") a trade only if: (1) the trade exceeds the trading limits established under Section I(A) of this rule for that customer and it has been communicated to the executing broker as described in Subsection (A); or (2) the trade is an error for which the executing broker is responsible.  If a Clearing Member has a basis for rejecting a trade, and chooses to do so in accordance with the provisions of Rule 2.21(B), it must notify the executing broker promptly.  (3). Billing.  A Clearing Member will pay all floor brokerage fees incurred for all transactions executed by the executing broker for the customer and subsequently accepted by the Clearing Member by means of the ATOM system. Floor brokerage fees will be agreed upon in advance among the Clearing Member, customer and the executing broker.  (B)  Responsibilities/Obligations of Executing Brokers  (1)  Customer Order Placement.  An executing broker will be responsible for determining that all orders are placed or authorized by the customer.  Once an order has been accepted, a broker or the broker's clerk must:  (a)  confirm the terms of the order with the customer; (b)  accurately execute the order according to its terms; (c)  confirm the execution of the order to the customer as soon as practicable; and (d)  transmit such executed order to the Clearing Member as soon as practicable in accordance with Exchange Rules and procedures.  2.   Use of Other Persons.  Unless otherwise agreed in writing, the executing broker is allowed to use the services of another broker in connection with the broker's obligations under these rules.  The executing broker remains responsible to the customer and Clearing Member under these rules.  3.    Executing Broker Responsibility for Verifying Clearing Member Authorization.  Prior to a broker accepting and executing an initial order for any new customer account, the executing broker must confirm with the Clearing Member by telephonic, electronic or written means, that: (f)  the customer has a valid account with the Clearing Member; (g)  the account number; (h)  the brokerage rate; (i)  the customer is authorized by the Clearing Member to place orders with the executing broker for that account; and (j)  a listing or summary of persons authorized to place orders for that account. The executing broker must retain a copy of the authorization or the specifics of the telephonic confirmation, which includes: opposite party, date, time, and any other relevant information.  The falsification of such information shall be the basis for disciplinary action.  4.   Rejection of Customer Order.  Where an executing broker has confirmed Clearing Member authorization to execute orders on behalf of a customer in accordance with this Rule 9.11A, the broker may, in the broker's discretion, reject an order that the customer transmits to the broker for execution.  The broker shall promptly notify the customer and the Clearing Member(s) of any such rejection.                 Carr Futures       150 S.

Please read the following problem very carefully, and write in a number at the end.  You should be ready to defend your answer.  Only a number is allowed, not an algebraic equation.  Acquiring a Company   In the following exercise you will represent Company A (the acquirer), which is currently considering acquiring Company T (the target) by means of a tender offer.  You plan to tender in cash for 100% of Company T's shares but are unsure how high a price to offer.  The main complication is this: the value of Company T depends directly on the outcome of a major oil exploration project it is currently undertaking.  Indeed, the very viability of Company T depends on the exploration outcome.  If the project fails, the company under current management will be worth nothing--$0/share.  But if the project succeeds, the value of the company under current management could be as high as $100/share.  All share values between $0 and $100 are considered equally likely.  By all estimates, the company will be worth considerably more in the hands of Company A than under current management. In fact, whatever the ultimate value under current management, the company will be worth fifty percent more under the management of A than under Company T.  If the project fails, the company is worth $0/share under either management.  If the exploration project generates a $50/share value under current management, the value under Company A is $75/share.  Similarly, a $100/share value under Company T implies a $150/share value under Company A, and so on.   The board of directors of Company A has asked you to determine the price they should offer for Company T's shares.  This offer must be made now, before the outcome of the drilling project is known.  From all indications, Company T would be happy to be acquired by Company A, provided it is at a profitable price.  Moreover, Company T wishes to avoid, at all cost, the potential of a takeover bid by any other firm.  You expect Company T to delay a decision on your bid until the results of the project are in, then accept or reject your offer before the news of the drilling results reaches the press.   Thus, you (Company A) will not know the results of the exploration project when submitting your price offer, but Company T will know the results when deciding whether or not to accept your offer.  In addition, Company T will accept any offer by Company A that is greater than the (per share) value of the company under current management.  Thus, if you offer $50/share, for instance, Company T will accept if the value of the company to Company T is anything less than $50.   As the representative of Company A, you are deliberating over price offers in the range of $0/share (this is tantamount to making no offer at all) to $150/share.  What price offer per share would you tender for Company T's stock?   $______ per/share   ",epao@mba2002.hbs.edu,john.arnold@enron.com,Re: try this one...,2001-05-11 00:40:00-07:00,sent

You plan to tender in cash for 100% of Company T's shares but are unsure how high a price to offer.  The main complication is this: the value of Company T depends directly on the outcome of a major oil exploration project it is currently undertaking.  Indeed, the very viability of Company T depends on the exploration outcome.  If the project fails, the company under current management will be worth nothing--$0/share.  But if the project succeeds, the value of the company under current management could be as high as $100/share.  All share values between $0 and $100 are considered equally likely.  By all estimates, the company will be worth considerably more in the hands of Company A than under current management. In fact, whatever the ultimate value under current management, the company will be worth fifty percent more under the management of A than under Company T.  If the project fails, the company is worth $0/share under either management.  If the exploration project generates a $50/share value under current management, the value under Company A is $75/share.  Similarly, a $100/share value under Company T implies a $150/share value under Company A, and so on.       The board of directors of Company A has asked you to determine the price they should offer for Company T's shares.  This offer must be made now, before the outcome of the drilling project is known.  From all indications, Company T would be happy to be acquired by Company A, provided it is at a profitable price.  Moreover, Company T wishes to avoid, at all cost, the potential of a takeover bid by any other firm.  You expect Company T to delay a decision on your bid until the results of the project are in, then accept or reject your offer before the news of the drilling results reaches the press.       Thus, you (Company A) will not know the results of the exploration project when submitting your price offer, but Company T will know the results when deciding whether or not to accept your offer.  In addition, Company T will accept any offer by Company A that is greater than the (per share) value of the company under current management.  Thus, if you offer $50/share, for instance, Company T will accept if the value of the company to Company T is anything less than $50.

Please read the following problem very carefully, and write in a number at the end.  You should be ready to defend your answer.  Only a number is allowed, not an algebraic equation.  Acquiring a Company       In the following exercise you will represent Company A (the acquirer), which is currently considering acquiring Company T (the target) by means of a tender offer.  You plan to tender in cash for 100% of Company T's shares but are unsure how high a price to offer.  The main complication is this: the value of Company T depends directly on the outcome of a major oil exploration project it is currently undertaking.  Indeed, the very viability of Company T depends on the exploration outcome.  If the project fails, the company under current management will be worth nothing--$0/share.  But if the project succeeds, the value of the company under current management could be as high as $100/share.  All share values between $0 and $100 are considered equally likely.  By all estimates, the company will be worth considerably more in the hands of Company A than under current management. In fact, whatever the ultimate value under current management, the company will be worth fifty percent more under the management of A than under Company T.  If the project fails, the company is worth $0/share under either management.  If the exploration project generates a $50/share value under current management, the value under Company A is $75/share.  Similarly, a $100/share value under Company T implies a $150/share value under Company A, and so on.       The board of directors of Company A has asked you to determine the price they should offer for Company T's shares.  This offer must be made now, before the outcome of the drilling project is known.  From all indications, Company T would be happy to be acquired by Company A, provided it is at a profitable price.  Moreover, Company T wishes to avoid, at all cost, the potential of a takeover bid by any other firm.  You expect Company T to delay a decision on your bid until the results of the project are in, then accept or reject your offer before the news of the drilling results reaches the press.       Thus, you (Company A) will not know the results of the exploration project when submitting your price offer, but Company T will know the results when deciding whether or not to accept your offer.  In addition, Company T will accept any offer by Company A that is greater than the (per share) value of the company under current management.  Thus, if you offer $50/share, for instance, Company T will accept if the value of the company to Company T is anything less than $50.       As the representative of Company A, you are deliberating over price offers in the range of $0/share (this is tantamount to making no offer at all) to $150/share.  What price offer per share would you tender for Company T's stock?       $______ per/share                           ",epao@mba2002.hbs.edu,john.arnold@enron.com,RE: Extra credit,2001-05-13 09:16:00-07:00,sent

"John -  I left a message about this last week, but wanted to follow-up with additional information for your review.  We have three offerings currently available (or coming soon) that I feel would compliment the small/mid cap and fixed income exposure you already have through Redwood, Sequoia, and Willow.  Quantitative Allocation, LLC: Integrates four quantitative investment models to drive aggressive (and potentially leveraged) asset allocation decisions. Generates exposure to stock and bond markets through indexing techniques and futures transactions.  Portfolio market exposures can range from +325% to -175% of net assets.  This is clearly different from the largely non-leveraged stock-picker funds you already own.  I would consider this to be a predominately large-cap investment (I think of it as an index fund with a brain and on steroids - call me and I'll explain that comment in more detail).  Juniper Crossover Fund, LLC: Managed by OrbiMed Advisors, and focused on global biotech and pharma.  Up to 30% participation in private equity.  This could be a way to get you some private equity exposure with a world-class manager.  Tamarack International Fund, LLC: Long/short stock-picker fund focused on the international mid-cap market.  I feel this fund is very similar in style to the managers you already own, but would give you exposure to the international markets that you currently lack.  This is a new fund and the first closing will probably be in June.  Of course, the summaries above are for information purposes only and do not constitute an offer to sell or solicitation of an offer to buy interests in these funds.  Please call me if you're interested in any of the strategies outlined above, and I'll have the appropriate offering memorandum sent to you.

"John  Hope you're well.  We are doing some work here on the long term curve for UK natural gas and  would value your views on the long term NYMEX Nat gas curve. By long term I am talking 7-20 years.   Our thinking is that beyond the traded period of 5-10 years forward, UK  prices would at least partially reflect the long run marginal cost of LNG in  a ""globalised"" market provided US prices were not significantly above.  As we are currently working on some long term structured deals it would be  great to get your input on this.

Reuters English News Service, 05/22/01             May 28, 2001  TIME Magazine Topping Out In Houston Again  BY CATHY = BOOTH THOMAS/DALLAS  Send the architects south. Silicon Valley may be power= less and profitless, but Houston, the nation's energy capital and home to t= he oil-baron excesses of the 1980s, is back in ""bidness."" The energy giants=  in Texas have big fat wallets these days--and even bigger construction pla= ns. Not since the boom days of 1982, when trophy architects like Philip Joh= nson and I.M. Pei reconfigured the skyline, has Houston seen so much constr= uction activity by the energy sector.  Leading the parade, ironically, is E= nron, an old energy behemoth that has reinvented itself as a high-tech trad= ing firm dealing in everything from natural gas to Internet bandwidth. In f= act, its new 40-story headquarters, designed by Cesar Pelli, will be fronte= d by a seven-story ""podium""--or shorter building--to house what Enron is ca= lling the largest commodities-trading environment in the world.  This envir= onment, spread over four floors, each the size of a city block, will become=  home this August to 2,000 employees trading commodities that range from Ol= d World (crude oil, petrochemicals, steel and lumber) to New World (emissio= n credits and derivatives). Chairman Kenneth Lay and CEO Jeff Skilling are = even moving from their skyboxes to work in seventh-floor offices so they ca= n peer down into the pit.  When the bigger 40-story structure is finished i= n December, Enron's will be the first new skyscraper in downtown Houston si= nce 1987--to be followed by three more by 2003. Besides Enron, Calpine Corp= ., the nation's leading independent-power company, based in California, wil= l move into a new 32-story high-rise. And Reliant Resources, the IPO spun o= ff this month from its Houston parent to deal with Texas' new deregulated e= lectricity market, has signed on for offices in a 36-story skyscraper.  Wha= t's fueling the high-rise fever is simple: excess cash. Enron's first-quart= er revenues were up 281%, while Calpine's revenues and net income were each=  up more than 400%--even with California's deadbeat utility PG&E owing the = company more than $300 million.  After a decade of contraction in the busin= ess, with companies having shut offices from New Orleans to Oklahoma, dereg= ulation and new marketing strategies are sparking Houston's renaissance. ""E= nron is a leading example of the new energy industry. Ten years ago, there = were no trading floors,"" points out Stephen Brown, senior economist with th= e Federal Reserve Bank in Dallas. Both Calpine and Reliant will also have t= rading operations in their new offices.  Though Houston no longer relies so=  heavily on the energy business (down to 48% of the local economy from 82% = in 1982) the turnaround sure feels good after the city lost more than 15,00= 0 energy-sector jobs two years ago, says Barton Smith, director of the Inst= itute for Regional Forecasting at the University of Houston. It has gained = those jobs back, plus some. Says Smith: ""The current boom is what's keeping=  Houston afloat while the rest of the country is suffering.""  None of this = matters to real Houston lovers, of course. They're just interested in bragg= ing rights. After a bad decade, they're beginning to sound like the biggest=  and the best in Texas again. ""Boomlet?"" says Laura Schwartz, spokeswoman a= t Enron. ""It's more than a mini-boom.

Investment bankers pride themselves on making vast amounts of money, but a successful private equity professional takes devilish pride and supports an even bigger ego for working fewer hours while making even more money than his (rarely her) investment banking brethren. Unfortunately, some members of the private equity community mistakenly believe that their growing wealth is the result of their own talent and charming personality rather than a simple profiting from the hoarding of capital, as Karl Marx so astutely described.  Consider the plight of Peter Chung (see attached email), a recent hire at the Carlyle Group.  After completing his two-year stint as an Analyst at Merrill Lynch, Chung was persuaded to seek out new opportunities in Korea working as part of Carlyle's vast Asian investment team.  Working at a private equity firm allows Chung to check out Korean night clubs (which would be legally classified as brothels in the United States) 3-4 times a week, though Chung made it clear that he needs only two months to ""learn a little bit of the buyside business"" so he can begin nightly visits.  Already a self-described ""stud"" on the New York City dating scene, Chung looked to the emerging island of Korea where the standard of living for young foreign men is bolstered by the low per capita income of native residents (roughly $12,600 per person).  By making in excess of ten times the average national wage, Chung quickly found himself to be quite the ladies man as the locals were attracted to his fat wallet and U.S. citizenship.  Thus bolstered by an initial rendezvous or two, Chung decided to cement his legacy by setting out on the quixotic mission to sleep with all of the fine women of Korea.  As of May 15, 2001, Chung alludes to having had sexual relations with five ""hot chicks.""  According to Chung's own calculations, there are roughly one billion ""hot chicks"" remaining in Korea.  Clearly there is a break in Chung's sexual predator model as he apparently believes that not only is the global female population of 3 billion comprised of 1/3 hot Korean chicks, but he will be able to sleep with that many before his finest member falls off or he dies of exhaustion.  Sadly, Chung cannot complete his mission alone.  The quality of prophylactics in Korea are not quite up to U.S. standards (Chung would probably claim Korean condoms are too small) and he needs your help to continue his quest for infamy.  If you would like to contribute to this valiant mission, please direct your gift of a FDA-approved ""domes"" to the address below:  Peter Chung The Carlyle Group Suite 1009, CCMM Bldg. 12, Yoido-dong, Youngdeungpo-ku Seoul 150-010, Korea  Chung asks that you consider using FedEx or another international overnight courier since he may be on the verge of running out of protection. Alternatively, if you would like to pursue a job working for The Carlyle Group in Korea, write to the following address:  The Honorable James A. Baker 1001 Pennsylvania Avenue NW Suite 220 South Washington, DC 20004-2505  Please note that Mr. Baker, the lead spokesperson for The Carlyle Group, a the former Secretary of State from the George Herbert Walker Bush Administration.  Since leaving the White House, Jim Baker has continued his international mission to spread goodwill and STDs throughout the world by supporting young Romeos such as Mr. Chung.  For a first-hand account of life in private equity, please read Peter Chung's travelogue (attached).  Please keep in mind that Chung's experience is partially a function of his prior status as a ""stud"" and may not be reflective of private equity experiences in general.  Not all of us can hope to be as smart, debonair and modest as Mr. Chung.

I go out to Korea's finest clubs, bars and lounges pretty much every other night on the weekdays and everyday on the weekends to (I think in about 2 months, after I learn a little bit of the buyside business I'll probably go out every night on the weekdays).  I know I was a stud in NYC but I pretty much get about, on average, 5-8 phone numbers a night and at least 3 hot chicks that say that they want to go home with me every night I go out.  I love the buyside,.... I have bankers calling me everyday with opportunties and they pretty much cater to my every whim - you know (golfing events, lavish dinners, a night out clubbing).

WASHINGTON -- President Bush's chief political strategist owns hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of stock in companies potentially affected by the president's top legislative priorities, newly released federal records show.  Karl Rove, one of the president's most trusted advisers on almost every major legislative initiative, owns between $100,000 and $250,000 of stock in Enron Corp., Pfizer Inc., General Electric Co., Boeing Co. and Johnson & Johnson, among other holdings. (Federal law requires public officials to report their assets, income and debts in broad ranges only). All of these companies could be affected by one or more of the policies or legislative initiatives on which the president consults Mr. Rove: tax cuts, increased defense spending, an industry-oriented energy policy and health-care reform. Mr. Rove said yesterday that he has been waiting for several months for approval from the Office of Government Ethics to sell all of his stock holdings and roll the proceeds into a diversified account without having to pay capital-gains taxes, as permitted by federal law. In the meantime, ""I have had to avoid being involved in matters that specifically and materially affect my specific holdings,"" Mr. Rove said.  Mr. Rove said he filed his financial disclosure reports Dec. 30 and was later informed by the Office of Government Ethics that he should sell all of his stock holdings to avoid even the appearance of a conflict of interest.  But the government ethics office, which couldn't be reached for comment yesterday, has yet to officially grant Mr. Rove a certificate of divestiture, which would allow him to roll his proceeds into diversified accounts, according to White House spokeswoman Anne Womack. It appears that Mr. Rove has lost tens of thousands of dollars as a result of the delay because most of his stocks have lost value since the beginning of the year.  Mr. Rove insisted that he has been careful to avoid any discussions that directly affect companies he is invested in, as federal conflict-of-interest laws require. But that can't be easy for Mr. Rove, widely regarded as one of the most powerful and influential figures in the White House. Mr. Rove serves as the president's top political adviser and runs the administration's long-term strategy team. He is also the president's top liaison to outside groups, including corporations.  ""He's involved in virtually every decision that is made here,"" says a White House aide. It is unclear how many times, if ever, Mr. Rove recused himself from discussion inside the White House.  President Bush, already under fire from Democrats for his administration's close ties to industry, is likely to draw more scrutiny as a result of the new disclosures of financial links between top White House officials and major U.S. corporations, especially energy firms.  The White House disclosed the personal finances of Mr. Rove and several other top administration officials at the behest of the media. It appears that as a result of an administrative backlog, Mr. Rove is the only member of the senior staff who hasn't been given the green light to sell his stock, according to a White House aide.  The reports show that Mr. Rove was one of several White House officials with a financial connection, past or present, with Enron and other energy companies. Larry Lindsey, the president's top economic adviser who helped draft the energy plan, received $50,000 from Enron in 2000 for consulting work he did for the company, the documents show.  Lewis Libby, chief of staff to Vice President Dick Cheney, who was chairman of the White House task force that wrote the energy plan, recently sold tens of thousands of dollars of stock in Enron and other energy companies, including Texaco Inc., Exxon Mobil Corp. and Chesapeake Energy Corp. It is unclear when the transaction went through.  Clay Johnson, director of presidential personnel, reported holding between $100,000 and $250,000 in El Paso Energy Partners LP.

International Saudi Arabia Sets Pacts With 9 Oil Firms  06/04/2001 The Wall Street Journal A17 (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)  JEDDAH, Saudi Arabia (AP) -- Saudi Arabia signed agreements with nine oil companies yesterday, a move that marks the first major foreign investment in its energy sector since the industry was nationalized in the 1970s.  The expected deal, valued at $25 billion at least, involves the development of three natural-gas fields in the kingdom, as well as a number of related power plants, transmission pipelines and water-desalinization projects. Exxon Mobil Corp., the world's largest publicly traded oil company, is the lead manager on two of the projects, including the $15 billion Ghawar Core Venture 1 project. It also will lead the Red Sea Coast Core Venture 2 project. Royal Dutch/Shell Group was chosen to lead the Shaybah Core Venture 3 project.  The Western companies will help Saudi Arabia convert its utilities from oil burning to natural gas, which would free up more of the kingdom's crude oil for export.  The other companies selected were BP PLC, TotalFinaElf SA, Conoco Inc., Phillips Petroleum Co., Occidental Petroleum Corp., Enron Corp. and Marathon Oil Canada Inc.  Saudi Arabia's state-owned energy company, Saudi Aramco, will be an equity owner in the projects.  Saudi Arabia nationalized its oil fields in 1975 after tension caused by the Arab oil embargo against the West that began two years earlier, and it closed its energy exploration and production sectors to foreign investment.  Although locked out of the production of energy, Exxon Mobil has $5 billion in refining and petrochemical joint ventures in the country, and it said it is also the largest foreign purchaser of crude oil and other hydrocarbons from Saudi Aramco.

Business; Financial Desk Saudi Arabia in Pacts With Nine Global Oil Firms Energy: Deals to develop natural gas fields and other projects, worth at least $25 billion, are first major foreign funding in sector since 1975. From Associated Press  06/04/2001 Los Angeles Times Home Edition C-2 Copyright 2001 / The Times Mirror Company  JIDDAH, Saudi Arabia -- Saudi Arabia signed agreements with nine international oil companies Sunday, a move that marks the first major foreign investment in its energy sector since nationalizing the industry in 1975.  The deals, worth a total of $25 billion or more, involve the development of three natural gas fields in the kingdom and a number of related power plants, transmission pipelines and water desalinization projects. The Western companies will help Saudi Arabia convert its utilities from oil-burning to natural gas, which would free up more of the kingdom's crude oil for export.  Exxon Mobil Corp., the world's largest publicly traded oil company, is the lead manager on two of the projects, including the $12-billion-to-$16-billion Ghawar Core Venture 1 project. It also will lead a second core project. Royal Dutch/Shell was chosen to lead a third project. The last two projects have a value of $7 billion to $10 billion each, Prince Saud al Faisal told reporters.  The other companies selected were BP of Britain, TotalFinaElf of France, Conoco Inc. of Houston, Phillips Petroleum Co. of Bartlesville, Okla., Occidental Petroleum Corp. of Los Angeles, Enron Corp. of Houston and Marathon Oil Co. of Houston.  Harry Longwell, director and senior vice president at Exxon Mobil, said the financial terms of the deal are still being discussed. But he said his company is ready to begin the work when the final contracts are signed.  ""The Saudis' expectations are extremely aggressive,"" Longwell said. ""It's a very tight schedule and in recognition of that, the ability to get this done is one of the key reasons we were chosen to lead two of these ventures. We already have a senior management team in place and are ready to go to work immediately.""  Saudi Oil Minister Ali Ibrahim Naimi said the companies are expected to profit on returns from the exploration and development of gas fields with more than 15% of the investment cost.  Saudi Arabia's state-owned energy company, Saudi Aramco, will be an equity owner in the projects.  Saud said if the companies discover oil, they will be compensated and the fields will be repossessed by Saudi Arabia.  Saudi Arabia nationalized its oil fields in 1975 and closed its energy exploration and production sectors to foreign investment.  Although locked out of the production of energy, Irving, Texas-based Exxon Mobil has $5 billion in refining and petrochemical joint ventures in the country and is the largest foreign purchaser of crude oil and other hydrocarbons from Saudi Aramco.

DAILY DATEBOOK JON CARROLL Enron is my spiritual teacher Jon Carroll  06/04/2001 The San Francisco Chronicle FINAL E.10 (Copyright 2001)  THE BUDDHA SAYS that we take wisdom where we find it. Perhaps the Buddha does not say that, but it's not a bad idea anyway. The Buddha would have said it, maybe, had he not been saying the other things.  Our enemies can teach us lessons. Our adversaries can make us stronger. They can be consumed with greed and contempt, their very breath can be toxic, and yet their actions can open upward-flowing paths. Take Enron, the energy company, or Chevron, another energy company, or El Paso Natural Gas, yet another energy company. These organizations are the minions of Satan. They pillage and they profit. They are in the ascendant. Their enemies fall before them like cordwood. Ordinary citizens cower and meekly hand over tribute.  And yet we thank them. We send our investigators after them and we pray that their executives land in jail, but we thank them. They have shown us the nature of our enslavement. They have defined the nature of our sloth.  We have believed the Big Lie. We have believed in the free lunch. We have trusted those who would pander to us. We have eaten energy in great dripping gobs. Did we know it was not infinitely renewable? Oh yes. Did we understand that energy companies could create ""shortages"" whenever they wanted merely by closing plants for ""maintenance""? You bet we did. And did we confuse the energy companies with charitable organizations and/or alchemists able to repeal the laws of nature? We did not.  But it was more convenient to forget those things, and so we did. We have busy lives. We must do the things we must do. The infrastructure is everywhere crumbling, and we are patching it up ourselves. We are paying bureaucrats with taxes, but the bureaucrats are inadequate, so now the spirit of volunteerism is much praised.  Volunteers are people who do jobs that other people are being paid to do but don't.  AND SOMEHOW, EVEN in a society as relentlessly materialistic as this one, we forgot about our own checking accounts. Already seduced by the idea that credit card debt is good clean fun, we decided to waste a lot of money using energy we didn't need.  I'm not talking about using a washing machine instead of going down to the river and beating your clothes with small stones -- I'm talking about washing machines with quarter-full loads and settings far too powerful for the task at hand. Right? Lights burning in unoccupied rooms. Appliances plugged in but never used.  We pay for it. We send our wonderful money straight to the largest villains in American commerce because we are too stupid to do anything else. You wonder why they have contempt for us. You wonder why Dick Cheney believes he can fool all of the people all of the time. Because he has.  Look: Last week the secretary of commerce suggested means-testing Social Security -- that is, means-testing a pension plan. You gave us the money, we kept it for 40 years, now -- prove that you need it!  Why did he suggest that? Because he can! Why did PG&E demand additional compensation for its executives, who are moral dimbulbs and social criminals under any fair definition? Because they can get away with it! They will get away with it! You watch!  I AM NOT saying that we have no one to blame but ourselves. There are active villains, and there are people who allow villainy to occur. Everyone in a corrupt system is corrupt. The fools are the ones who don't end up with any extra money.  We are the fools. If we understand our foolishness, we begin to be wise. We send lovely bread-and-butter notes to Enron -- once we were blind, but now we see. And we await developments, or create them.  --------------------------------------------------------  It would be foolish to mention SUVs. When the brain is ready, the ear will hear.

EDITORIAL WASHINGTON INSIGHT Gloom today, glut tomorrow Carolyn Lochhead  06/04/2001 The San Francisco Chronicle FINAL A.19 (Copyright 2001)  WHAT GOES UP usually comes down. And few industries are more prone to boom and bust than energy.  Imagine the news stories a few years from now: ""Crisis hangover -- energy stocks sink as prices plunge; But California consumers still stuck with high bills."" ""The energy industry is suffering its worst downturn since the supply glut of the 1990s, as dozens of big new power plants come on line, and the just-completed Alaskan gas pipeline sends natural gas prices to their lowest levels in six years.  ""The one bright spot for Texas generators is California, where consumers are locked into long-term contracts for wholesale electricity that the state signed at the peak of its blackouts in the summer of 2001.  ""Sacramento lawmakers have appealed to President Daschle to help get the state off the hook, arguing that California will never claw its way out of its economic slump if businesses continue to flee to states where energy is cheap.  ""But top Enron lobbyist Gray Davis, a former governor of California, warned Daschle that suppliers would have little choice but to go to court to enforce the contracts the state signed.""  Washington and Sacramento are agog with the energy crisis and bursting at the seams with plans to fix it. But the one thing no one - - even environmentalists -- suggests is letting high energy prices discourage energy consumption or encourage new supplies.  ""To economists, letting the price rise is the solution,"" said Paul Portney, president of Resources for the Future, a Washington think tank. ""To elected representatives, having the price go up is the problem.""  Political memories tend to be selective and short. But it was the energy glut of the 1990s that contributed to California's blackouts, $3 gasoline and $400-a-month heating bills. Likewise, high prices are now laying the seeds of their own destruction.  As a story in the New York Times noted, an energy investment boom ""promises a cyclical increase in supplies that is expected to stabilize or reduce prices in coming months, many industry executives and private analysts say.""  Through much of the 1990s, there was a glut of energy. Fuel of all kinds was really cheap.  How cheap? Adjusted for inflation, as cheap as in 1949, economists calculate.  Energy is the oxygen of the economy, and rock-bottom prices contributed to the long economic boom. But low prices also caused energy production to slump and consumption to soar.  People ditched their economy cars for SUVs. Houses got bigger, ceilings got higher and kitchens sprouted industrial stoves with enough BTUs to melt aluminum. Stores, offices and homes turned into summertime refrigerators.  Low prices discouraged energy development.  ""Oil was so cheap for so long, that people were selling their refineries,"" Portney said. ""You had virtually no exploration for new natural gas when prices were at $2 a BTU.""  As demand soared and supply fell, prices rose. Profits have grown so robust that green fuels, such as biomass and wind, are becoming economically viable. The oil industry is booming. Refineries are expanding. The long-delayed construction of a natural gas pipeline from Alaska now looks likely. So many power plants are under construction that the market may be flooded with as much as 200,000 new megawatts by 2004.  Investments in energy efficiency -- from new-age superconducting transmission wires to better light bulbs -- are suddenly looking attractive for the first time in decades.  ""High prices will dampen demand, high prices will encourage supply, and will encourage people to make better use of what they've got,"" said Robert Ebel, director of energy for the Center for Strategic and International Studies. ""So we're starting on the down slope. We're not very far down. When prices start to decline, I can't say how far they will go. But they will decline, because that's just the law of supply and demand. Prices decline, demand starts to creep up again, there's less incentive to add to supply, and here we go again.""

By Vidya Ranganathan  06/04/2001 Reuters English News Service (C) Reuters Limited 2001.  BOMBAY, June 4 (Reuters) - Analysts have reacted with surprise to last week's decision of ratings agency Fitch to cut India's sovereign ratings outlook to negative from stable, and say there are no grounds to downgrade the country.  Fitch, which rates India's foreign currency obligations at BB-plus, a notch above Moody's Investors Service and Standard & Poor's, cited concerns about fiscal policy, privatisation and deterioration in foreign investment climate. However, economists speculated it could either be on account of Fitch adjusting its ratings in line with other global agencies, or a fallout of U.S. energy giant Enron Corp's threat to exit an Indian power venture over payments problems.  Moody's and S&P said on Friday they have not revised ratings or outlook but are disappointed with fiscal reform efforts.  Local currency and stock markets reacted nervously to the announcement, but economists said most concerns were exaggerated.  ""When the direction of reforms is positive and government flows are improving, the outlook should not change,"" said Mohan Nagarajan, chief economist at local rating agency CARE Ltd.  Even if the provocation for the rating review was the Enron episode, analysts said the problems were specific to the power sector and will not affect the robust foreign investment the country has been receiving.  ""Enron was a bad deal, made on unreasonable terms in the first place and does not reflect the ability of the government to pay its dues,"" said an economist with a U.S.-based fund.  Some of the confusion arises from the various ratings assigned to India.  Moody's has retained a positive outlook on its Ba2 rating since late 1999, while S&P has a stable outlook and a BB rating.  CONCERNS OVERSTATED  Analysts said none of the factors Fitch cited had deteriorated in the past year, since it first rated India.  Fitch said India's fiscal-monetary mix was unfavorable, real interest rates were high and there was the risk of a debt trap.  India marginally overshot its budgeted fiscal deficit in 2000/01 (April-March) to 5.2 percent of GDP, down from the previous year's 5.6 percent.  But laws to control government spending are awaiting parliament's approval, there are incentives for disciplined state governments and a determined effort at privatising state-run firms has begun.  Burgeoning fiscal deficits have persisted for a decade and public debt at 60 percent of GDP is high, but at six percent annual growth, India is one of the fastest expanding economies in Asia.  ""In terms of external liquidity, India is much stronger than its BB+ rating while even its public debt to GDP ratio is lower than that of some Asian nations,"" said P.K. Basu, chief economist for South East Asia at Credit Suisse First Boston, Singapore.  Foreign investment has been pouring in - portfolio flows at $2.2 billion so far in 2001 are at record levels and compare with $1.56 billion for the whole of 2000 - and foreign exchange reserves are strong at $42.8 billion.  Interest rates and yields have also dropped, with the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) adopting an aggressive easing stance this year to prop the slowing economy, and inflation is benign.  ""The hardest initial steps are being taken and there is still a lot of inertia, but soon there will be a willing audience and reforms can progress faster,"" CARE's Nagarajan said.  But critics said the changes were still very superficial and structural reforms that would spur long-term growth and demand were lacking.  ""What the rating agencies have emphasised is fiscal consolidation, which means better revenue streams, efficient expenses, user charges for public utilities...we promised these three years back and haven't moved very far on those,"" said Saumitra Chaudhari, economist with local rating agency ICRA Ltd.  ""We still do not have a securities bill, mature debt market and our banks have not cleaned up,"".   Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.      INDIA: India rupee ends off lows, fwds close higher.  06/04/2001 Reuters English News Service (C) Reuters Limited 2001.  BOMBAY, June 4 (Reuters) - The rupee ended unchanged on Monday, recovering from the day's low after a large European bank sold dollars, dealers said.  It had slipped to a low of 47.04 per dollar in early deals on dollar purchases by a jewellery importer. The rupee ended at steady at d47.01/02 per dollar.  Dealers said there was no impact of Friday's comments from international rating agencies which had raised concerns over continuity of foreign investment and dragged shares lower.  The currency recovered from lows around 47.085 on Friday, reacting to international rating agency Fitch's revision in the outlook for India's ratings on sovereign debt to negative from stable, citing worries about fiscal policy, privatisation and deterioration in the country's foreign investment climate.  Later, rating firms Moody's and Standard & Poor's (S&P) said they were disappointed over the government's reform effort.  Moody's also raised a concern about India's Maharashtra state utility's ongoing tussle with Houston-based Enron Corp and said: ""the dispute indicates that India's government may not be willing to live up to its contractual obligations"".  It added this would further deter foreign direct investment from coming into the country.  The comments weighed on bond prices, which extended losses on Monday, and in turn led to paying in dollar forwards.  ""After a long gap, there was corporate paying interest in forwards today,"" a dealer with a state-run bank said.  The six-month forward ended at an annualised 5.10 percent compared with Friday's 4.95.

LONDON, June 4 (Reuters) - Energy brokerage Spectron said late on Friday it had traded the first brokered gas-electricity arbitrage, or ""spark spread"", deal in the UK since the launch in March this year of new electricity trading arrangements (NETA).  ""Now that liquidity has returned to the electricity market post NETA, such transactions are expected to become more common..."", said Spectron in a statement. The deal was concluded between UK utility Powergen and U.S. energy group Enron .  Spectron said the trade, covering winter 2002, was for 60 megawatts of electricity at 21.42 pounds a megawatt hour and for 100,000 therms of gas at 24.85 pence a therm.  The winter period specified in the deal ran from October 1 to March 31.  For the electricity, one day was defined as 2300 hours to 2300 hours.  For the gas, one day was 0600 hours to 0600 hours.  The deal comes as the industry moves to create standard terms and conditions for spark spreads.  Powergen is due to meet in mid-June with other traders, including Aquila Energy , for talks aimed at agreeing standard terms.  ""It is hoped that the market will soon establish standardised documentation leading to a standardised product that will help promote liquidity in one or more levels of efficiency,"" said Spectron.

By Sriram Ramakrishnan  06/04/2001 Reuters English News Service (C) Reuters Limited 2001.  BOMBAY, June 4 (Reuters) - Lenders to Enron Corp's troubled Dabhol Power Company begin a two-day meeting in Singapore on Tuesday to try and settle differences over continued support to a controversial $2.9 billion power project in India.  Representatives of some of the world's largest banks like Citibank , ABN AMRO , and Bank of America, will be at the meeting. Indian lenders like the Industrial Development Bank of India , State Bank of India and ICICI will also participate. Market analysts speculate that the meeting will attempt to forge a joint stand on supporting the project which now produces 740 MW of power and is slated to increase it to 2,184 MW shortly in its second phase.  But it comes against a backdrop of rising tension between Dabhol and the Indian state utility, the Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB), which is the sole buyer of Dabhol's electricity.  Indian lenders, who have lent the bulk of the funds to the plant, want to continue supporting the project.  But they are being opposed by offshore lenders who want to withdraw their loans. Loans of around $638 million of the offshore lenders are covered by guarantees provided by Indian institutions.  The Indian lenders, fearing for their profitability if the foreign banks pull the plug, plan to oppose any such move.  But they have been forced on the backfoot by MSEB's decision last week to stop buying power from Dabhol and terminate its 1995 contract with the company under which it agreed to lift the entire output.  The MSEB has complained that Dabhol produces costly power while Dabhol has blamed MSEB for defaulting on payments worth $48 million.  Last month, Dabhol issued a preliminary notice to terminate its contract to sell power. It has also filed for arbitration in London. This provoked MSEB to haul Dabhol before a local regulatory body, the Maharashtra State Electricity Regulatory Commission (MERC), which issued a temporary order staying the arbitration proceedings.  The dispute has already affected India's image among foreign investors.  Last week, global rating agency Moody's expressed concern over slippage in the Indian government's reform programme and cited the Enron's dispute as an example that the country may be losing credibility with foreign investors.  ""The dispute indicates that India's government may not be willing to live up to its contractual obligations. As a consequence, this would further deter foreign direct investment from coming into the country,"" Moody's said.  India's federal Power Minister Suresh Prabhu tried to dispel those fears in an interview with Reuters on Sunday.  ""India is always in favour of making sure that international contracts are respected,"" he said. ""There is no need for concern."" ($1 = 47 Indian rupees).   Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.      INDIA: UPDATE 1-India's Prabhu says power reforms enter new phase. By Clarence Fernandez  06/04/2001 Reuters English News Service (C) Reuters Limited 2001.  BOMBAY, June 4 (Reuters) - India's reforms of its sputtering power sector have entered a new phase, with plans afoot to free up private supply, overhaul debt-ridden state utilities and recraft tariffs, Power Minister Suresh Prabhu told Reuters.  With investors' fears fanned by a squabble between U.S. energy giant Enron Corp and a local utility, Prabhu said in an interview late on Sunday that India is standing behind international contracts. ""Sanctity of contracts has to be kept,"" Prabhu said.  The row began late last year when the utility in western Maharashtra state defaulted on payments of $48 million to Dabhol Power Company, 65 percent owned by Enron. The 2,184 MW power project is India's largest foreign investment, at $2.9 billion.  Prabhu has vowed to take Indian reforms in a new direction.  ""Absolutely,"" he said in reply to a question whether India's reforms have entered a different phase. The Power Ministry will now also focus on power distribution, he added, besides its early preoccupation with generation needs.  ""In India unfortunately for the last 10 years...reforms policy was skewed in favour of generation,"" he said. ""We never really realised that distribution is the more important part of the process.""  Prabhu added, ""We have now decided we will make enough structural changes in distribution so that at the end of distribution enough investment is made.""  CHARTERED ACCOUNTANT  A chartered accountant, Prabhu hails from the verdant regions of India's western coastal strand, and chaired a co-operative bank that was one of the country's largest, in terms of deposits, before his foray into politics.  An errant lock of hair straying across his forehead, Prabhu eschews the Indian politician's traditional uniform of starched white handspun cotton for the shirtsleeves and trousers preferred by the professionals who have entered government, and whom local media call ""technocrats"".  Prabhu said India has decided to allow private producers to sell power direct to consumers, lifting curbs that have hobbled the country's decade-old reform effort.  He said the question of power affordability had spurred him to ask India's states to permit third-party sales of power, which analysts have called a stumbling-block for foreign investment.  ""They cannot force a generator to sell power only to the SEBs, and that's a major change we are trying to make,"" Prabhu said, referring to the states.  SEBs or state electricity boards are owned by the state governments, and supply power to most of India.  India estimates that 100,000 MW of fresh capacity will have to be installed over the next 12 years to meet its power needs. Most of the $200 billion in funds that will be required will have to come from foreign private investment.  But India's spotty reform record over the last decade has made investors wary. Bureaucratic procedures, legal delays and political wrangling have held up reform moves.  RATING REVISED TO NEGATIVE  Last week global rating agency Fitch revised India's sovereign rating outlook to negative from stable, citing fiscal concerns, the slow pace of privatisation and deterioration in the country's foreign investment climate. Competing agency Moody's sees signs of slippage in the reforms, and Standard & Poor's has expressed worries over India's budget deficit.  Prabhu said he wants to overhaul state power utilities by introducing standard accounting policies, cutting transmission and distribution losses to 15 percent, and tackling crushing debt, thus helping to lure foreign investment into the sector.  The poor financial health of the utilities, expected to run up combined losses of about $6 billion in the 2001/02 fiscal year, has proved a hurdle in efforts to draw private investment.  Prabhu said an expert panel examining ways to restructure SEB finances - looking at technical, commercial and tariff issues - is expected to report within a few weeks.  ""For the first time we will be preparing commercial data which is internationally accepted. We will be preparing technical data which is internationally appreciable. And thirdly, we'll be creating an information base which will be created by experts and then made available to the states,"" he said.  The utilities' transmission and distribution losses run to up to 25 percent of the electricity they generate, compared to a figure of about eight percent internationally, he said.  Prabhu wants to trim this to about 15 percent within two or three years.  ""In the case of India, I am willing to accept a figure of 14 percent to 15 percent, because to bring it below that will be technically feasible but commercially unviable,"" he added.  Other steps to tone up power generation include attempts to link the eastern region with the rest of India, efforts to boost plant load factors through modernisation of equipment, and to persuade people to use energy more efficiently.  Prabhu said he is building political will to support these moves through a programme to tell consumers why they can no longer get power cheap, or even free, as many did in the past.

Nigerian president slams US energy firm Enron for ""poor performance""  06/04/2001 BBC Monitoring Source: The Guardian web site, Lagos, in English 4 Jun 01/BBC Monitoring/(c) BBC  Text of article by Francis Obinor entitled: ""Obasanjo chides Enron on Lagos power project""; published by Nigerian newspaper The Guardian web site on 4 June  For failing to live up to expectation of the Nigerian government and the people as regard its role in the Independent Power Project (IPP) initiated by the Lagos State government two years ago, Enron, the American firm got a hard knock from President Olusegun Obasanjo at the weekend [2-3 June]. In his conclusion, Obasanjo accused Enron, a major player in the electricity project, of poor performance and bad faith. Ostensibly angry at the delay in the project's full take-off and the 30 MW recently connected to the national grid from the scheme, the president on the American Cable News Network (CNN) declared: ""Enron has played a dirty game on us. Dirty game in two ways.""  Beside putting up an exorbitant price, the company according to the president, also failed to comply with the terms of the contract. Continuing, Obasanjo said: ""The price at which they (Enron) have tried to sell power to us has been very exorbitant. Two, what they told us they would do, they have not done.""  While refusing to disclose the firm's charges, Enron Vice-President of Marketing John Ambler said the primary objective of the company was to get the project on stream. ""We have a project that is very close to coming on line,"" he said, stressing that the company's desire is to see the project work effectively in Nigeria, especially in Lagos. He added that Enron is committed to the IPP and assured Lagosians that they would soon begin to feel the impact.  The state government brought forward the June 2001 deadline it set for the commencement of the first phase of the project when it fired the first 30 MW of electricity to the national grid two weeks ago.  At the Government House on 23 May, Governor Bola Tinubu said his administration and the contracting firm felt that there was no harm in bringing the date forward and assured that another 30 MW would be added soon. He noted that, contrary to expectations that the project would cover the entire state at a go, it would be in phases and the focus for now would be industrial consumption. ""The concentration for now is not as private homes, we would soon get there,"" Tinubu assured.  The controversial IPP programme, which the federal government had at one time been accused of frustrating, has suffered several setbacks, including Enron's initial plan to sell its shares to AES, another American company. Last April was originally fixed for the project's take-off but the failure of Trevi, a construction company in charge of transmitters, caused a shift in the date.

India: India and Bush Administration: Beyond assumptions  06/04/2001 Business Line (The Hindu) Copyright (C) 2001 Kasturi & Sons Ltd (KSL); Source: World Reporter (TM) - Asia Intelligence Wire  SOON after Mr George W. Bush Jr. won the US elections, Indian observers proclaimed quickly that a Republican administration bodes good for India. A Republican administration was expected to not pester India about human rights violations in Kashmir, not force it to sign the CTBT, and get tougher with China.  Mr George Bush's decision to ""drop by"" the External Affairs Minister, Mr Jaswant Singh's meeting with the American National Security Advisor, Ms Condoleezza Rice, seemed to somehow confirm this false sense of euphoria. This narrow thinking fails to understand the drivers of Republican ideology. The reality is the Republicans care about a range of issues that will force the BJP Government to make some difficult decisions. Take the first issue of human rights violations in Kashmir. It is true there are many isolationists in the Republican Party who, probably, do not care about human rights violation in Kashmir so long as it does not affect them, and is not happening in their backyard. But there is another powerful force in Republican politics - the religious wing. This includes powerful members of the US Cabinet such as The Attorney-General, Mr John Ashcroft, who are Christian fundamentalists.  Mr Bush himself claims to be a 'born again Christian'.  The religious right is rarely interested in foreign policy; it mostly concerns itself with moral and social issues such as abortion and teenage pregnancy. But the few times it does intervene, it is when it feels a country is ""persecuting Christians"". And when it does intervene, no Republican administration dares cross it.  For instance, China is periodically identified as a country that persecutes Christians. Christian missionaries and ministers are routinely harassed and imprisoned because they are trying to spread their religion. Because of this issue, Republican members of the Christian right in Congress have all but declared a religious war on China, routinely opposing any attempt to improve relations - including trade relations - with that country.  India, as an emerging power, is more carefully watched, and frequently mentioned in the American press. Stories of Christian missionaries being burnt alive and nuns raped are attributed to ""elements associated with the Hindu fundamentalist ruling party"". In its latest human rights report, the US State Department noted these acts with concern.  The Pope's mention of these issues to the Prime Minister, Mr Atal Bihari Vajpayee, was also noted in the American press. India is, perhaps, half a step away from being branded as a country that ""persecutes Christians"".  A self-professed born-again Christian like Mr George Bush would quickly take up the Christian right's cause, trumping all other bilateral issues. Human rights may not matter to the isolationists, but Christian, and to a lesser extent Jewish, religious freedom matters tremendously to a Republican administration.  The second fallacy was that since the Republicans in Congress did not pass the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, they would not force other countries to pass the CTBT either. But why are the Republicans are opposed to the CTBT. The opponents of the CTBT feel that it fails to safeguard American security. They frankly care little about Indian security. They would love to be able to restrict India's ability to test and use its weapons. To them, nuclear weapons not in American hands translates into an unsafe world. Unless India manages to convince the Republicans otherwise, the Republican administration is likely to tighten the anti-proliferation screws on India.  The third fallacy relates to a tough, long-term strategic re-alignment the Bush Administration will demand of India. Mr Bush's foreign policy-makers are unreconstructed 'Cold Warriors'. In the post-Cold War era, they are desperately ""searching for an enemy"". They appear to have settled on China as ""the next enemy"". Their next step is to search for ""allies""  who rarely challenge their views. Thinkers in Washington and New Delhi believe that India and the US are ""natural allies"". But such a decision has an enormous range of long-term consequences for India.  To discuss just a few: Most of the Indian military's equipment comes from Russia and the former Soviet Union. Allying with the US will be seen by the Russians as abandoning them, and this could have an enormous impact on the legacy military equipment. Recent noises from the Foreign Ministry suggest India is also eager about Mr George Bush's proposed missile defence programme. But this technology is far from proven, and during the decade over which it may be developed (if it gets past Congress), China will most certainly develop many nuclear weapons. These may, primarily, be a deterrent against the US, but it will force India into an arms buildup it can barely afford.  The Americans are reserving their missile defence system for their ""closest allies"". India today is neither fish nor fowl - not quite a threat, but not quite an ally either. It is unlikely that India will be able to convince the Americans to give it the defence system.  Even if the Americans agree to sell it to India, it could never afford the sticker price. So, before it rejoices at the notion of anti-China hawks in the White House, let India ponder over the unexamined consequences.  The final issue is one that may precipitate in the very near term.  Enron and Maharashtra find themselves in a dispute that neither wants to lose, and that appears to be rapidly getting shriller. Mr George Bush's background is as a Texas oilman - and he is widely accused in the US of being beholden to the interests of the energy industry.  In fact, they were among the biggest ""contributors to his campaign"".  The Enron Chairman, Mr Kenneth Lay, is a friend of Mr Bush's, and was seriously considered for a job in his Cabinet. He is so well connected that he was recently accused of influencing who is appointed by the White House to regulate the energy industry. In the near term, Mr Bush could quite possibly lean heavily on New Delhi to ""make sure that Enron's interests are not neglected"". If New Delhi does not respond to his satisfaction, his opinion of India, and consequently, his administration's dealings with the country, are likely to be coloured far more than we think.

Enron's Indian Creditors Seek to Salvage Dabhol Project 2001-06-04 08:41 (New York)  Enron's Indian Creditors Seek to Salvage Dabhol Project       Mumbai, June 4 (Bloomberg) -- Indian banks that loaned money to Dabhol Power Corp., the local unit of Enron Corp., will try and persuade their international counterparts to keep alive the $3 billion project at a meeting of lenders in Singapore tomorrow.     The two-day meeting will be the first between the two groups of bankers since they met in London on April 24-25 to discuss an escalating dispute on power prices that has pitted Enron against the Maharashtra State Electricity Board, Dabhol's only customer.      ``We will discuss how we can go about resolving the problem,'' R.S. Agarwal, executive director at Industrial Development Bank of India, or IDBI, said. IDBI is the biggest lender to the Dabhol project.      The outcome of the Singapore meeting, to be held in the offices of ABN Amro Holding NV, one of the biggest international lenders to the project, will be crucial to the banks, which have loaned as much as $2 billion to Dabhol.      Indian banks fear the Maharashtra State Electricity Board's decision to stop buying power from Dabhol may strengthen international lenders' resolve to terminate the project and invoke government guarantees to recover their loans.      ``Foreign lenders want to close the (Dabhol) chapter,'' said Pradyumna Kaul, an activist with Enron Virodhi Andolan, a non- government organization opposed to the project. ``They are eager to call in their loans, even if it means taking a 10 to 15 percent cut, rather than spend more on supervision and legal expenses while watching the saga linger.''      Local banks such as IDBI are most at risk as the Maharashtra and federal governments have guaranteed only foreign banks' loans of about $600 million to the venture.      IDBI alone has exposure totaling 21.58 billion rupees ($460 million) to the project, including 15.28 billion rupees in guarantees.      Foreign lenders such as ABN Amro, Citibank N.A., a unit of Citigroup Inc., Bank of America and Credit Suisse First Boston in April approved Dabhol's decision to begin termination of its power supply contract with the board. They are in favor of canceling the project.      India's government risks having to pay 170 billion rupees in fines, resulting from guarantees it has offered on payments and loans, if Enron pulls out of the project.                               The Fight       Maharashtra State Electricity Board Wednesday stopped buying power from Dabhol as the dispute escalated. The board on May 24 told Dabhol Power Co. it was canceling its power purchase contract, six days after Dabhol gave the board notice it was set to pull out of the project because of the six-month dispute over bills owed by the board.      ``The MSEB's move has complicated the matter. We did not expect MSEB to do this,'' Agarwal at IDBI said last week.      Dabhol, 65 percent owned by Enron, and the board are in dispute over 3 billion rupees in unpaid bills for December and January. Others bills through March have been paid.      The board has refused to pay the December and January bills, saying they should be lowered to reflect a 4 billion rupee penalty the board imposed on Dabhol for not supplying power at full capacity on Jan. 28.      The dispute Thursday prompted debt-rating company Fitch to change its outlook on India to ``negative'' from ``stable.'' Fitch said the climate for foreign investors has deteriorated.      ``The dispute indicates that India's government may not be willing to live up to its contractual obligation,'' the Economic Times quoted Kristin Lindow, India analyst at Moody's Investors Service, as saying. ``As a consequence, this would further deter foreign director investment from coming into the country.''      Moody's and Standard & Poor's have stable outlooks on the country's sovereign rating. S&P has an investment grade rating of ``BBB'' on the country's sovereign debt. Moody's, like Fitch, rates India's debt as junk at ``BB2.''    Enron Japan's Hirl on Power Deregulation: Commodity Comment 2001-06-04 06:29 (New York)        Sydney, June 4 (Bloomberg) -- Joseph Hirl, chief executive of Enron Corp.'s Japanese unit, Enron Japan Corp., comments on the outlook for deregulation of Japan's electricity industry. He spoke at the Coaltrans Asia conference in Sydney.  On Japanese government policy:      ``The government does have a strong commitment to deregulation, but there are some significant policy concerns'' including a ``greater than 80 percent reliance on imports'' of energy.      ``The market has been open a bit over a year, however not much has happened. No genuine competition exists under the current system. The companies there recognize that it will happen. It's inevitable.      ``The level of competition in Japan now is similar to the U.S. in 1994-95, or Europe in 1996-97. Prices are about 400 percent higher than the U.S.      ``To put it in perspective, I won't give the name of this large chemical company, but it consumes about 600 megawatts. If you compare that business with a company that's just like it in Houston, Texas, the difference would be about $250 million a year in the cost of electricity.      ``For such an export-led economy, that's a difficult situation to be in, and it's contributing to the overall malaise in the economy.''  On the likelihood of a California-style electricity crisis in Japan:      ``Despite exploitation of California by the utilities, METI (Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry) and others recognize it was a problem of design, not competition'' in California.","dutch.quigley@enron.com, mike.maggi@enron.com",john.arnold@enron.com,FW: Enron Mentions - 06/04/01,2001-06-04 09:54:46-07:00,sent

If the answer is no to one or more of the above, a judgment call has to be made.   -----Original Message----- From:  Mayor, Philip   Sent: Wednesday, June 20, 2001 7:38 AM To: Arnold, John Subject: Volatility information  John--        I am a summer analyst working with Laura Luce in the central gas desk.       We are trying to assemble a client-based website which will be used to provide assorted information material to the natrual gas industry to specifically targeted Enron clients.  In so doing, we are trying to gather as much information as possible without crossing lines of propriety.  One of the issues which has come up recently is whether we would be allowed to post next month and/or year-out volatility data.  The data would be posted to a password protected site, but it would be on the extranet.  Chris Gaskill, who is generally our local authority on issues of propriety has suggested that this would ultimately be your decision.  Any comments on the propriety of exposing these volatility curves would be greatly appreciated.  Thank you for your time.

As you may recall, we tried several different approaches to minimizing the cost of the market running up and then down again.  The solution which gave the best solution was also the simplest one.  Principles as follows:  - Basically an advanced Offset to Last Trade - Definitions  - Intensity: Measures the length of time between transactions as a rolling average over the last x number of transactions (the Intensity Factor)  - Intensity Factor: The number of transactions used in calculating the rolling average Intensity  - Dead Interval: The period of time in which (if nothing occurs), an event or transaction is deemed to take place.  - Offset Reversion Ratio: The percentage by which the Offset will be reduced if a Dead Interval passes  - Spread Minimum: The minimum spread which can be used.  - Offset Minimum: The minimum offset which may be used.  - Spread-Offset Minimum: The minimum amount by which the spread must exceed the offset  - Spread Reversion Rate: The amount in dollars by which the spread will decrease if a Dead Interval passes  - Position Sensitivity: The position which, if exceeded, will cause the V Factor Adjustment to increase  - V-Factor adjust: The amount by which the Momentum will be increased if the Position Sensitivity is exceeded.  - Momentum: The measure of the degree to which the market is either just buying or just selling  - Adjusted Momentum: A Momentum number which may be boosted, causing a larger price reaction when the Position Sensitivity is exceeded.  - Offset: The amount by which a bid or offer will be increased/decreased when a transaction occurs.  - Spread: The difference between the bid and the offer - General Principles and Mechanics  - As each Sell (Buy) occurs, the Momentum decreases (increases).  - The Adjusted Momentum is the same as the Momentum, unless the Position Sensitivity is exceeded.  - If the Position Sensitivity is exceeded, then the Adjusted Momentum is boosted by the V-Factor Adjustment  - The Offset is calculated by looking up the Offset value on a table for the specified Adjusted Momentum  - The Spread is calculated by looking up the value to boost (decrease) the Spread on a table for the Specified Intensity  - As the Intensity value drops, the Spread widens. As it increases, the Spread decreases.  - In a running market, the offset will increase quickly. If it establishes a new level, the Offset will slowly decrease  - If the market runs up and whipsaws back, the offset will stay large  - If a market range trades, the offset will trend to zero.  - If there are a large number of transaction in succession, the spread will widen  - If there are a small number of transactions in succession, the spread will tighten.

"Aren't you used to me popping in every few years by now??  And are you calling me wacky??  =)  Basically, I just started working for a new-ish hedge fund in Boston with Chuck Clough, the former Chief Investment Strategist for Merrill.  I got a random phone call yesterday from a woman who is just starting a hedge fund here in Boston.  She had heard I was in town and has been trying to get a hold of me to help her start her hedge fund.  She finally got my number from someone, who told her I had already started working with Chuck.  I'm not sure why she called me anyway, but she basically tried to convince me what a great opportunity it would be to work with her and her ""team.""  The only person on her ""team"" that she described was Jeff Gossett.  She said that she and her husband had hired him out of Southwest Texas undergrad and he had stayed with her first fund for four years (which she subsequently sold) until Enron recruited him away.  The stories of the recruitment seemed a bit wild, like using private jets to fly him to Europe.  Anyway, she said that he had quit Enron two weeks ago to join her in this new hedge fund. Having never heard of him and thinking she seemed to be a bit of a crackpot, I was wondering if it was true.

Aren't you used to me popping in every few years by now??  And are you  calling me wacky??  =)  Basically, I just started working for a new-ish hedge fund in Boston with  Chuck Clough, the former Chief Investment Strategist for Merrill.  I got a  random phone call yesterday from a woman who is just starting a hedge fund  here in Boston.  She had heard I was in town and has been trying to get a  hold of me to help her start her hedge fund.  She finally got my number from  someone, who told her I had already started working with Chuck.  I'm not  sure why she called me anyway, but she basically tried to convince me what a  great opportunity it would be to work with her and her ""team.""  The only person on her ""team"" that she described was Jeff Gossett.  She said  that she and her husband had hired him out of Southwest Texas undergrad and  he had stayed with her first fund for four years (which she subsequently  sold) until Enron recruited him away.  The stories of the recruitment seemed  a bit wild, like using private jets to fly him to Europe.  Anyway, she said  that he had quit Enron two weeks ago to join her in this new hedge fund.  Having never heard of him and thinking she seemed to be a bit of a crackpot,  I was wondering if it was true.  I would never leave this opportunity, even  if she offered me the world, but I have friends who really want to break  into hedge funds, so I was doing some due diligence on their behalf.

"Only if nuclear fuel storage problems persist.   The nuclear fleet, if unencumbered by NRC or spent fuel storage problems, will operate at 90-95% (95% during non-refueling years and 90% during re-fueling years).   Remember re-fuelings are now on a 24 month cycle and the next big cycle is spring and fall of 2003.   The 2002 re-fueling outages are actually less than normal.  -----Original Message----- From: Arnold, John  Sent: Monday, August 06, 2001 9:32 PM To: Presto, Kevin M.

Over the next 2/3 weeks we will be presenting to a number of these interested parties and would be happy to keep you updated on progress. I anticipate more aggressive ""marketing"" of the product from September onwards as we are still stuck in the summer vacation schedule and it is making serious ""roadshowing"" difficult.

"i just cant get too enthused about the short side.  why did cash go out trading +5 for a weekend when there was zero power gen demand.  the easy answer is that pipes were short and everybody playing catchup from this week.  fine.  what's it going to trade next week.  the gas daily swap implies flat, but it's lagged the actual spread all month.  i think cash surprises by trading positive next week with no power gen.  this market is not trading like we run out of injection space.  so either the market is wrong (maybe but a dangerous assumption to make) or I don't see why sep is so overvalued relative to the rest of the curve.  you can certainly argue that the winter and cal 2 are too high, but those certainly don't seem to be going down very fast.  march is off 8 cents since jun 29.  so if the market wants to say that march is worth 354, then why is sep too high at 298?

 don't think it necessarily is considering the winter will have a risk premium associated with it regardless of the fundamentals after last winter until we get the first weather forecast of the winter.  i think we could stay at this price level for a while and then have the next move down late oct early nov when people try to withdraw gas and nobody wants it.  i think it was in 99 when the first 3 weeks of nov were injection.  can you imagine going into dec with 3.15?   but if there is injection capabililty through oct 31, and the winter is going to stay relatively high due to risk premium, how far are the storage spreads going to widen?    biggest position right now is short jv and short a ton of u vol. producers are waiting for any move up in cal 2 to give it a spanking. falling back in love with longer term gas though.  think 2/3 and 2/4 spreads are golden.  thoughts?

what are your thos ont he mkt?        demand has come back a great deal but im not sure its gonna    help-maybe     too little too late. ive been trading this a little mroe actively now    that     the mkts been leaning mosrtly one say but fortuntely sold early in the    week     on the rally before the aga-and after.biggest problem for muchlower    prices     in the short term is it seems now the whole mkt has the same supply and     demand view. but if we can believe that production is up 3% which seems    to     be the implication we'll have no problm moving about 3.1 tcf(3.2 basis     doe).economic growth will be at best flat to last year thru 2001 and i'd    say     that means the winter will struggle to get much bullishness--ie our    biggest     concievable draw would be in the order of 2.2 tcf-leaves us around 1 tcf    end     march, hard to get too excited about that. sprds? not much of clue-i    tend to     think inverses cont to errode like feb/apr-but maybe not until mkt gives    up     on winter. prepensity for us to stay contango maybe accelerates.that    this     year.        you think we get to shut in levels? since so much prod growth appears    to     be from independents does that raise the avg shut in value from say 1.60    to     $2.00 or higher??         anyway-be cool,hope all is well. enjoy the weekend. are you going to    be     in NYC anytime soon?

In the past, I have not made a habit of participating in PaineWebber syndicate offerings because, frankly, investment banking was not our strong suit. Now, with the UBS merger, our deal flow is starting to look much better (see press release below).  5.79% isn't a mind-blowing number, but it is impressive in light of market conditions and the fact that ""UBS Warburg was the only bank to have a positive return among the 17 banks listed including Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs and Salomon Smith Barney.""  As the market rebounds, I think you may benefit from participation in IPOs and other syndicate deals.  If you have an interest in this, let me know and we'll discuss it further.  Thanks.  January 12, 2001 UBS Warburg has been ranked first in IPO performance for US offerings in 2000, according to Commscan's Equidesk. Achieving a 5.79% return, the result is particularly significant considering the Bank was not involved in any of the top 10 largest IPOs of the year. Lead managing 12 IPOs, UBS Warburg was the only bank to have a positive return among the 17 banks listed including Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs and Salomon Smith Barney. UBS Warburg also tied first place for IPO ""batting average"" (the % of IPOs that trade above issue price), achieving the highest ""batting average"" overall. Three deals in 2000 which helped achieve these impressive statistics include Intermune Pharmaceuticals, Luminex, and Bruker Daltonics.  > Michael Gapinski > Account Vice President > UBS PaineWebber, Inc. > 713-654-0365 > 800-553-3119 x365 > Fax: 713-654-1281 > Cell: 281-435-0295 michael.gapinski@ubspainewebber.com    Notice Regarding Entry of Orders and Instructions: Please do not transmit orders and/or instructions regarding your UBS PaineWebber account(s) by e-mail.

I hope all is well. Due to the job commitments of the SME's, they can not attend a 4 hour kick off meeting. Therefore, we need to cut it down to 1.5 to 2 hours. Send me the agenda with some detail regarding the purpose of the different sections on the agenda. I know as a minimum I want the following to occur at this meeting  1. Demo simulation 2. Duties & responsibilities of SME/The processes associated with these tasks (i.e. questions, interviews meetings) 3. Give out the first set of questions to SME's and get the show started 4. Go over time lines and milestones associated with SME's duties and responsibilities.  Now I know the content review sessions have been estimated to last approximately 4 hours, but we should be able to give the SME's advance notice and schedule them individually. Together with them we can address this issue and obtain a win win solution (i.e. cut down the time with a great process and commitments to Excellence).  We need to get started on this deal.

American Rice holds transportation on Dow moving gas from the various pipeline interconnects with Dow at Katy to their facility in Freeport. ARI will give you monthly nominations and be responsible for imbalances on Dow.  If you provide an index related price, we would like the option to convert it to a fixed price at our option.

This will be a second devastating attack on America if we allow it to happen.  We DON'T have to allow it to happen. Here's what YOU can do to help prevent it...  When the markets re-open, in a show of support and solidarity, BUY at least one share of stock in a U.S. company.  Open your minds to imagine what a SLAP in the face of terrorism it would be if the American  markets actually RISE instead of PLUNGE when they re-open!

This e-mail is sponsored by noone, so if you also have a suggestion for people without stock accounts, please add that information before you forward this e-mail.  If we all participate in a massive stock selloff, then we are BOWING to terrorism. We do NOT have to do that. We have a choice.  People by the hundreds of thousands are lining up to donate one pint of blood. Think of the effect  we can have if we line up in the same way to contribute to the American economy!  For very little money you can DO something to show would-be terrorists that they will NOT win.                           YOU CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE!  Take part in this revolution and forward this e-mail to everyone on your mailing list. We can reverse the tide of the finanical carnage throughout the world just by doing that.

"thx for the update.  funny how the banks will deal with us and ospraie won't.  oh well, nothing we can do.  -----Original Message----- From: Abramo, Caroline  Sent: Tuesday, September 25, 2001 10:43 PM To: Arnold, John Subject: EQUITY COMMENTS   Hi- thought you'd want to know some of the recent equity comments from a few of the funds.  Bad comments first.. ENE: Ospraie, one of the Tudor funds has actually been reducing all their trading exposure to us becuase of our ""credit situation"".  At one point they probably had a 12,000 contract short gas position with us where we might have 1000 lots on now.  They have studied our financials for the last 2 years and like the rest of wall street can not determine how to value us.. I think the bigger concern though is our credit line situation.  Its been leaked that the availability of our borrowing is linked to stock price.. obviously the street does not know the real details but the fact these rumors are out there and lack of statements by us to the contrary are causing some to panic.  I've heard the same come out of SAC which is a 5 B equity shop who also put on the favorite short-ENE.  SAC has just started trading with us.   I am not sure what to do about this.. luckily Ospraie is the only group commenting on our credit.  I am not having any problems YET with any of the banks except CSFB- and thats not new.. I have not been able to trade with them for the last year.  I am anticipating problems which is why I am trying to work out a clearing system in the interim.   I am sure Ken will do a better job of putting some of these fears to rest.. and the street will be able to assign us a PE in line with other trading companies (8-10) plus some growth component (5) for developing businesses.  And at $20, they reckon we get taken out anyway.. the fact remains that Enron has major franchise value.   Good news- Ospraie covered their short at $30 when PGE resiolution came out Thursday and we rallied $4.   Other comments from Catequil.. they generally think a lot of the energy sector (E+Ps) are close to bottom.  They also commented that they are likely to buy El Paso at a 10.5 PE soon (even though ours is currently 12.5 and they believe in us) because they just have more access to El Paso Sr Mgmt and understand their biz better.  (Lot of El Paso and Dynegy support out there).  They were never short us.   On other names: EOG- could see it down to $22 but see $35 based on NAV more realistic.  Like EOG and Chesapeake- well hedged.   Also like Philips/ Statoil on the Alaskan gas play as well as the fact that they have 0 mid-east exposure.   Like Talisman- only has exposure in Sydan, Nexus- Yemen",caroline.abramo@enron.com,john.arnold@enron.com,RE: EQUITY COMMENTS,2001-09-26 13:52:14-07:00,sent

Bad comments first.. ENE: Ospraie, one of the Tudor funds has actually been reducing all their trading exposure to us becuase of our ""credit situation"".  At one point they probably had a 12,000 contract short gas position with us where we might have 1000 lots on now.  They have studied our financials for the last 2 years and like the rest of wall street can not determine how to value us.. I think the bigger concern though is our credit line situation.  Its been leaked that the availability of our borrowing is linked to stock price.. obviously the street does not know the real details but the fact these rumors are out there and lack of statements by us to the contrary are causing some to panic.  I've heard the same come out of SAC which is a 5 B equity shop who also put on the favorite short-ENE.  SAC has just started trading with us.   I am not sure what to do about this.. luckily Ospraie is the only group commenting on our credit.  I am not having any problems YET with any of the banks except CSFB- and thats not new.. I have not been able to trade with them for the last year.  I am anticipating problems which is why I am trying to work out a clearing system in the interim.   I am sure Ken will do a better job of putting some of these fears to rest.. and the street will be able to assign us a PE in line with other trading companies (8-10) plus some growth component (5) for developing businesses.  And at $20, they reckon we get taken out anyway.. the fact remains that Enron has major franchise value.   Good news- Ospraie covered their short at $30 when PGE resiolution came out Thursday and we rallied $4.   Other comments from Catequil.. they generally think a lot of the energy sector (E+Ps) are close to bottom.  They also commented that they are likely to buy El Paso at a 10.5 PE soon (even though ours is currently 12.5 and they believe in us) because they just have more access to El Paso Sr Mgmt and understand their biz better.  (Lot of El Paso and Dynegy support out there).  They were never short us.   On other names: EOG- could see it down to $22 but see $35 based on NAV more realistic.  Like EOG and Chesapeake- well hedged.   Also like Philips/ Statoil on the Alaskan gas play as well as the fact that they have 0 mid-east exposure.   Like Talisman- only has exposure in Sydan, Nexus- Yemen",caroline.abramo@enron.com,john.arnold@enron.com,RE: EQUITY COMMENTS,2001-09-27 15:43:40-07:00,sent

Principles as follows:  - Basically an advanced Offset to Last Trade - Definitions  - Intensity: Measures the length of time between transactions as a rolling average over the last x number of transactions (the Intensity Factor)  - Intensity Factor: The number of transactions used in calculating the rolling average Intensity  - Dead Interval: The period of time in which (if nothing occurs), an event or transaction is deemed to take place.  - Offset Reversion Ratio: The percentage by which the Offset will be reduced if a Dead Interval passes  - Spread Minimum: The minimum spread which can be used.  - Offset Minimum: The minimum offset which may be used.  - Spread-Offset Minimum: The minimum amount by which the spread must exceed the offset  - Spread Reversion Rate: The amount in dollars by which the spread will decrease if a Dead Interval passes  - Position Sensitivity: The position which, if exceeded, will cause the V Factor Adjustment to increase  - V-Factor adjust: The amount by which the Momentum will be increased if the Position Sensitivity is exceeded.  - Momentum: The measure of the degree to which the market is either just buying or just selling  - Adjusted Momentum: A Momentum number which may be boosted, causing a larger price reaction when the Position Sensitivity is exceeded.  - Offset: The amount by which a bid or offer will be increased/decreased when a transaction occurs.  - Spread: The difference between the bid and the offer - General Principles and Mechanics  - As each Sell (Buy) occurs, the Momentum decreases (increases).  - The Adjusted Momentum is the same as the Momentum, unless the Position Sensitivity is exceeded.  - If the Position Sensitivity is exceeded, then the Adjusted Momentum is boosted by the V-Factor Adjustment  - The Offset is calculated by looking up the Offset value on a table for the specified Adjusted Momentum  - The Spread is calculated by looking up the value to boost (decrease) the Spread on a table for the Specified Intensity  - As the Intensity value drops, the Spread widens. As it increases, the Spread decreases.  - In a running market, the offset will increase quickly. If it establishes a new level, the Offset will slowly decrease  - If the market runs up and whipsaws back, the offset will stay large  - If a market range trades, the offset will trend to zero.  - If there are a large number of transaction in succession, the spread will widen  - If there are a small number of transactions in succession, the spread will tighten.

"John:  Natural is overbought on a short-term basis but my analysis has not produced any daily strength patterns, which normally indicates the rally has more to go.  I will not see a daily strength pattern until Monday at the earliest. Potential for Nov. gas to see 249 - 258 into next week.

"If these problems are not being addressed as they should be, call me and I'll get on it.  This is unacceptable.  -----Original Message----- From: Abramo, Caroline  Sent: Sunday, October 07, 2001 11:22 PM To: Lagrasta, Fred Cc: Dyk, Russell; Zivic, Robyn Subject: Back office issues    Fred-   There are a number of issues we need to address with back office procedures immediately.  We are losing money on avoidable problems and gaining a bad reputation in the market.  Lets get Derek and Michelle together Tuesday afternoon.  2 of our counterparties are writing letters of complaint.. here's a sample of some of the quotes we have heard from the 10 counterparties we have added in the last 6 months.    ""I shouldn't have to spend my time decomposing the invoices and confirmations you send out""  ""It has been 10 days since we traded and we haven't received a shred of paper to give us the details of the trade""  ""We are being told in a confirm something different than we are being invoiced for""  ""We did not trade 300 contracts per day, it was per month - do you guys even think before you type""  ""I am a CFO and an accountant and I can't decipher what you are trying to confirm here""    From a business dinner where a client of ours was speaking casually to large industrials and endusers. One, upon the mentioning of B2B exchanges said ""they WILL NOT ever trade on EOL again because the backoffice procedure was such a nightmare.. they couldn't rely on the accuracy or timeliness of the confirm.  This was a captive client who and needs to trade... who will not show us their flow again.   The latest is the most disturbing:  ""we just want to do a small trade to test your system. We have heard it is a nightmare but want to see for ourselves - I mean how difficult can it be to book the purchase of 50 lots of crude"" And still 5 days later they do not have one paper to show the details, not one phone call to confirm the trade...nothing.  We even warned the BO that this was a new customer and to make best eforts to make sure the process runs smoothly and efficiently. Well, clearly we failed  We do not understand what is going on in the back office.  Is it that they are too disconnected from our daily operations to understand how integral their accurracy is to our business?  Is there too much turnover? How are they trained?  Who is in charge of the ""backoffice""?  There seems to be a different manager for every step of the process.. who co-ordinates all their efforts?  Does anyone care?  Ok.. I'll stop.. For our part, we have Michelle coming up to NY for a week in December (we wanted this to happen as soon as she started but did not work for her).  We have to stop this before we lose clients (which we will).    All the problems are being caused by the following:  1. Our inability to generate an accurate position report for our clients.  This has already cost us money this year. Our clients do 10 trades a day.. they are constantly in and out of positions.. it is imperative that we get these right.  As well, this report is our ONLY check to make sure deals are entered and entered correctly into the system.  There are hundreds of books at Enron.  We have postions on with dozens of them.  We currenttly do not have an automated mechanism to pull deals from every book in one shot.  We have to select books one by one.. this method will always result in books being ommmitted given our deal flow.  Michelle is in charge of this process.  We need a IT person on this yesterday.  Michelle is spending most of her day verifying the validity of the report she generates.  Robyn, Russell, and I check it everyday.. there are always mistakes.  2. There is a breakdown in the backoffice functions after Michelle collects the tickets we write and verbally confirms them.  There is no check after they have been imput.  There are ALWAYS imput errors.  Michelle needs to check every deal after its entered into the system going forward.    We also have NO set procedures for the bookings of deals.  We have no idea where our job ends and the book admin's starts.. for non standard deals like gas dailies and swaptions we need to know the exact process from start to finish.  2a. Confirms are sent immediately after deals are entered.. what if deals are imput incorrectly? the confirm goes out anyway resulting in mass confusion at the client.  Going forward, confirms need to be delayed until we can confirm that everything about the deal is correct.  2b. Invoicing.. there have been dozens of occassions where the amounts we are invoicing do not match the deals done..   3. EOL- We are pushing hard to get counterparties on here.. we have signed Renaissance up (a 10B program fund) but I shudder to see how EOL will fair at these tasks.    4. Credit- All of our clients are margined.  If deals are in the system incorrectly, the wrong MTM goes to the client.. another mis-match.  We work closely with credit since we need to collect initial margin from some clients.. this amount changes daily- we need someone who can get on the phone with clients and explain these numbers through.. again, we are doing this now.

We are losing money on avoidable problems and gaining a bad reputation in the market.  Lets get Derek and Michelle together Tuesday afternoon.  2 of our counterparties are writing letters of complaint.. here's a sample of some of the quotes we have heard from the 10 counterparties we have added in the last 6 months.    ""I shouldn't have to spend my time decomposing the invoices and confirmations you send out""  ""It has been 10 days since we traded and we haven't received a shred of paper to give us the details of the trade""  ""We are being told in a confirm something different than we are being invoiced for""  ""We did not trade 300 contracts per day, it was per month - do you guys even think before you type""  ""I am a CFO and an accountant and I can't decipher what you are trying to confirm here""    From a business dinner where a client of ours was speaking casually to large industrials and endusers. One, upon the mentioning of B2B exchanges said ""they WILL NOT ever trade on EOL again because the backoffice procedure was such a nightmare.. they couldn't rely on the accuracy or timeliness of the confirm.  This was a captive client who and needs to trade... who will not show us their flow again.   The latest is the most disturbing:  ""we just want to do a small trade to test your system. We have heard it is a nightmare but want to see for ourselves - I mean how difficult can it be to book the purchase of 50 lots of crude"" And still 5 days later they do not have one paper to show the details, not one phone call to confirm the trade...nothing.  We even warned the BO that this was a new customer and to make best eforts to make sure the process runs smoothly and efficiently. Well, clearly we failed  We do not understand what is going on in the back office.  Is it that they are too disconnected from our daily operations to understand how integral their accurracy is to our business?  Is there too much turnover? How are they trained?  Who is in charge of the ""backoffice""?  There seems to be a different manager for every step of the process.. who co-ordinates all their efforts?  Does anyone care?  Ok.. I'll stop.. For our part, we have Michelle coming up to NY for a week in December (we wanted this to happen as soon as she started but did not work for her).  We have to stop this before we lose clients (which we will).    All the problems are being caused by the following:  1. Our inability to generate an accurate position report for our clients.  This has already cost us money this year. Our clients do 10 trades a day.. they are constantly in and out of positions.. it is imperative that we get these right.  As well, this report is our ONLY check to make sure deals are entered and entered correctly into the system.  There are hundreds of books at Enron.  We have postions on with dozens of them.  We currenttly do not have an automated mechanism to pull deals from every book in one shot.  We have to select books one by one.. this method will always result in books being ommmitted given our deal flow.  Michelle is in charge of this process.  We need a IT person on this yesterday.  Michelle is spending most of her day verifying the validity of the report she generates.  Robyn, Russell, and I check it everyday.. there are always mistakes.  2. There is a breakdown in the backoffice functions after Michelle collects the tickets we write and verbally confirms them.  There is no check after they have been imput.  There are ALWAYS imput errors.  Michelle needs to check every deal after its entered into the system going forward.    We also have NO set procedures for the bookings of deals.  We have no idea where our job ends and the book admin's starts.. for non standard deals like gas dailies and swaptions we need to know the exact process from start to finish.  2a. Confirms are sent immediately after deals are entered.. what if deals are imput incorrectly? the confirm goes out anyway resulting in mass confusion at the client.  Going forward, confirms need to be delayed until we can confirm that everything about the deal is correct.  2b. Invoicing.. there have been dozens of occassions where the amounts we are invoicing do not match the deals done..   3. EOL- We are pushing hard to get counterparties on here.. we have signed Renaissance up (a 10B program fund) but I shudder to see how EOL will fair at these tasks.    4. Credit- All of our clients are margined.  If deals are in the system incorrectly, the wrong MTM goes to the client.. another mis-match.  We work closely with credit since we need to collect initial margin from some clients.. this amount changes daily- we need someone who can get on the phone with clients and explain these numbers through.. again, we are doing this now.

This will be the 5th annual ribfest, and John Mee has his work cut out for him to defend the title he won last year (for the second time).  I believe he will have a tough time, as the competition looks increasingly focused on unseating the former Bostonian from his Throne.  For those of you who haven't been to a ribfest in the past, it's a barbeque competition where 5 to 7 cooks compete to see who can produce the best Baby Back Ribs (if you want those Fred Flintstone beef ribs, you ain't getting them here).  A blind-judging takes place to determine the winner, but often the crowd gets up in arms and nominates a ""peoples choice"" (though this is not officially recognized by the sanctioning body).    Every year, my wife asks the following:  ""So, besides Ribs, beer and margaritas, what else will be served?""              I reply: ""Nothing comes to mind.""                   She replies: ""No.""   As you might expect, she wins this discussion year in, year out.  So, appetizers, sides, desserts and food & drink for the kids are also served.  The competition around the grills gets a little rough, so I recommend that the young and faint-of-heart maintain a safe distance while the cooking and competition is taking place.  The appropriate College football games will be broadcast, so you don't have to worry about missing any games.  There are a couple of changes to this year's competition: The competition will be held at the John Mee/Laura Benjamins compound in Bellaire Mike Paradise (who won the very first ribfest) has stepped out of the competition this year citing ""personal reasons""  Date & Time Saturday November 3rd.  We fire the grills up around 12:00, and the judging takes place between 3:00 and 3:30.    Where 4807 Elm Street in Bellaire  Directions (from John Mee himself) From downtown, take 59s to 610s. The first exit is the Bissonette//Fournace exit. Take this exit and go through the light, noting the gouging in the lamppost from that freak cherry-picker accident from last April. Before the Bisonette light, there is a big Chase Bank Building. Right before that building is Elm Street. Take a right on Elm Street exactly 236 yards to 4807 Elm Street. Go inside and ask for directions there, cause I really don't have a clue... KIDS Bring 'em!  We'll have the Moonwalk set up for them again this year, and we'll have hot dogs, burgers, popcorn and drinks for them.  The more kids the better.

"hey man no problem.i know youre a busy man.its getting ahrder to say how to play this thing. sprds are massive contango-minimal inverses in the winter. indeed there shudnt be any problems to supply gas this winter but suply growth hasnt been stellar and prob wont rise from here now.im not a raging bull but the past couple of aga and the cashs trength. and the mkt structure(no sellers in the forward), leads me to beleive there cud be more upside. mkt is prob a range mkt for a time. but overall i think this is a weather bet. if we have a winter it will suport the whole curve if its warm i will be awful-stay in that 2.00-2.50 rnage for spot prices.    i think the prompt is out of the woods-if so long as we have normal weather nov cash will be ok -wont trade lower than oct cash as long as we have big incentive to roll storage mar/apr? i bailed. basically washed. in the long term its prob ok but they arent gonna let me make any serious money on it in the next few weeks prob longer so why have it on esp when this winter is such a big discount to next-i guess theres some risk h/j moves higher if they y on y sprds come in much?? not sure so i bailed. i dont disagree with you on the calender sprds but i just dont think the entry pt is attractive. about the only thing im running is nov long agaisnt dec and jan shorts. pretty netrual no big bets on for now-first time in a awhile. nothing is that obvious to me. if mktstays sort of balanced until end dec i mite take a shot on the long side late dec early jan. i struggle paying sucha  big premium for the forward curve  -----Original Message----- From: John.Arnold@enron.com [mailto:John.Arnold@enron.com] Sent: Monday, October 08, 2001 7:58 PM To: LaFontaine, Steve Subject: RE: wheres the love?

Cash is impressive.  Agree shutins, switching, and some weather are making market look more like equilibrium.  Think with cash/futures at 20 cents, x/z looks crazy.  As soon as z becomes prompt, the fear factor/risk premium of it will decrease and the whole winter will come off.  Like your h/j trade.  Hard to see it really being worth 9 cents at settlement.

You have 10 lots out there now for Nov01 and 20,000/ day on the standard... can you offer 60 contracts (20,000*30) on the lots size.. the people that the product was meant for can just click their one or two lots.. its going to be the same price as the standard Nov01 contract right?   The physical standard is a limitation for funds.. all of them trade lots.. no one wants to sit there and figure out the contracts however easy it is.   I think I can get at least 4 more funds on EOL if you can do just this..these are people outside the Campbell types who can not trade OTC.  EOL is great for funds like Ren whose traders get buy/sell orders at the beginning of the trade day (I assume they get signals on close) and have discretion on how to execute through the day. Versus Campbell who gets a signal and executes orders immediately regardless of liquidity.. its all to do with the way they view slipage   Liz at Renaissance was not giving you the whole picture on how much they trade.. they are an 8 Billion fund.

EOL is great for funds like Ren whose traders get buy/sell orders at the beginning of the trade day (I assume they get signals on close) and have discretion on how to execute through the day. Versus Campbell who gets a signal and executes orders immediately regardless of liquidity.. its all to do with the way they view slipage   Liz at Renaissance was not giving you the whole picture on how much they trade.. they are an 8 Billion fund.   Last year they traded: 156,000 crude contracts- most in one day.. 6,000 contracts 85,000 nat gas- 6,000 highest one day 40,000 Nickel-1,000 highest one day  120,000 Ali- 6,000 52,000 Cu- 5,000 24,000 Zn- 2,000   The only other energy counterparty they have is Goldman (this is the case with a lot of the program traders).. they tried MS, but said they were terrible..

Pipeline subsidiary `A-` rated senior unsecured debt at Northern Natural Gas Co. and Transwestern Pipeline Co., are also placed on Rating Watch Negative.  The rating action primarily relates to the negative capital market reaction to recent disclosures by the company. The loss of investor and counterparty confidence, if it continues, would impair Enron's financial flexibility and access to capital markets, therefore, impacting its ability to conduct its business. On Oct. 16, 2001, Enron announced a $1 billion after-tax charge to earnings to be taken in the third quarter of 2001 and a reduction of balance sheet equity by $1.2 billion relating to the unwinding of structured transactions. Since that time, there have been several damaging news reports on the company and its management. More importantly, investors have voiced concerns. Enron's common stock price has plummeted and spreads on its debt have widened.  The company has attempted to quell rumors and has publicly stated that it has adequate liquidity to conduct its business. Approximately $1.5 billion of unused liquidity is available under committed bank lines.  An additional concern is that certain structured transactions of the company including Marlin Water Trust II and Osprey could unwind. While various sources of repayment exist, such as the sale or liquidation of underlying assets, or an equity offering, primary credit support is derived from the Enron obligation to remarket mandatorily convertible preferred stock if an amount sufficient to repay the notes has not been deposited with the trustee 120 days prior to the maturity date or upon a note trigger event. In the event that the issuance of the preferred stock yields less than the amount required to redeem the senior notes in either case, Enron is required to deliver additional shares. If Enron cannot or does not deliver on its obligation, then the amount of the deficiency becomes a payment obligation of Enron, representing a general unsecured claim. While trigger events include a downgrade of Enron's senior unsecured debt below investment grade by one of the major rating agencies in conjunction with specified declines in Enron's closing stock price over three consecutive trading days, Enron would have a forebearance period of 60 days as long as an attempt was being made to register the shares. The total amount of Marlin and Osprey debt is approximately $3.2 billion. Enron has not verified that the underlying assets have adequate market value to fully pay down the associated debt.  While capital market uncertainties have escalated, Fitch has no information to indicate that there are any fundamental problems with Enron's core wholesale, retail, and pipeline businesses. Fitch expects to be in contact with the company on a continuing basis to both monitor ongoing events and address strategic, longer-term issues.   STOCKWATCH Enron higher after dismissing CFO Fastow  10/25/2001 AFX News (c) 2001 by AFP-Extel News Ltd  NEW YORK (AFX) - Share of Enron were higher in opening trade, after the company dismissed its chief financial officer, Andrew Fastow, due to his past involvement in running two partnerships, in which Enron had invested, dealers said.  At 9.56 am, Enron was up 1.13 usd, or 6.95 pct, at 17.55. The DJIA was down 138.60 points at 9,207.52, the S&P 500 index was down 15.95 pts at 1,069.00 and the Nasdaq composite down 39.02 at 1,692.52. Enron said it named Jeff McMahon CFO to replace Fastow, after announcing Monday that the Securities and Exchange Commission is looking into the Fastow-related transactions.  ""In my continued discussions with the financial community, it became clear to me that restoring investor confidence would require us to replace Andy as CFO,"" said chief executive Kenneth Lay in a statement.  Enron shares have fallen sharply in recent days on concerns over financial transactions made with the two partnerships, LJM Cayman LP and LJM2 Co-Investment LP, which analysts said could affect future earnings and which have prompted class action suits against the company.  McMahon, who had been serving as chairman and CEO of Enron's Industrial Markets group, had quit his job as treasurer last year, after voicing concerns within the company about Fastow's role in running the two partnerships, according to the Wall Street Journal.  This morning, Salomon Smith Barney analyst Raymond Niles downgraded Enron to ""buy- speculative,"" from ""buy-high risk"", to reflect his concerns that ""lingering uncertainty over financial practices may begin to impair Enron's commercial operations.""  ""This is the least likely outcome, in our view, but one whose likelihood has increased over the last week as questions continue to be asked,"" he said.  ng/lj For more information and to contact AFX: www.afxnews.com and www.afxpress.com  Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

(ENE), but they have made almost no changes in policies concerning the top trader of North American power and gas, the companies said Thursday.     The concerns have arisen because Enron, which accounts for about a quarter of the trade in the country's power and gas markets, has seen its share price fall by a third this week due to uncertainties about its extremely complex financial structure.     Moody's has put Enron's credit on watch for possible downgrade, and some of the company's debt is trading like junk bonds in the secondary market this week.     ""We have made no changes to our credit policy concerning Enron,"" said John Sousa, chief spokesmann for Dynegy Inc. (DYN). ""It's business as usual.""     Williams Cos. (WMB) spokesman Jim Gipson said that his company, too, has made no changes and has no concerns about Enron's credit. Another Top 10 power and gas trading company, Aquila (ILA), has also left Enron credit unchanged.     Other companies expressed concern, though they've taken little if any action.    ""Like everyone else in the marketplace, we're proceeding with caution,"" said Lora Kinner, director of credit for Tractebel Energy Marketing, the North American subsidiary of the Belgian company Tractebel S.A.     Kinner said the company is just looking for more information and doesn't expect to make any drastic changes.      Calif Guarantees Allow Williams To Book Power Revenues By Andrew Dowell Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES  10/25/2001 Dow Jones Energy Service (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)  NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Clarifications by California as to what electricity transactions the state will back enabled Williams Cos. (WMB) to book $180 million in power sales from the previous period as third-quarter revenues, the company said Thursday.  The revenues came from power Williams sold through the California Independent System Operator, which runs the state's wholesale power market and clears and settles transactions. The state of California has paid more than $11 billion for power bought directly from suppliers, but has yet to pay for any ISO power since it took over the job of buying power for the state's ailing utilities in mid-January. Two weeks ago, however, the state made clear for the first time which ISO transactions it would back.  ""It's that fact that has allowed us for the first time to recognize dollars from sales to the California ISO,"" Williams Chief Operating Officer Steven Malcolm said on a conference call Wednesday.  Williams reported third-quarter net income of $221.3 million on revenues of $2.81 billion, up from $121.1 million on revenues of $2.33 billion in the same period the year before.  Williams is now in talks with California to secure payment for its ISO sales. The process is complicated by the state's role as guarantor of transactions undertaken on behalf of the utilities, which aren't creditworthy enough to buy power for themselves. The ISO didn't envision third-party guarantors when it set up its settlement process, and state accounting rules require more detailed bills than those sent out by the ISO each month, state power officials have said.  The state says it has set aside $1.2 billion to cover ISO transactions.  As reported, suppliers including Williams had charged the state with deliberately muddling the repayment issue to keep power flowing for free.  Willing To Renegotiate   Separately, Williams' officers also said the company was willing to discuss reworking its long-term contracts with California, provided the result benefited both parties.  California Gov. Gray Davis is under heavy fire for having locked the state into contracts running as long as 20 years at prices negotiated at the peak of a market that has since collapsed.  Both sides could potentially benefit from changes to the length of the term of the contracts or the specifics of power-supply obligations - perhaps freeing up supply that Williams thinks it could get more money for on the spot market, Malcolm said.  ""We're always willing to sit down with a customer,"" Malcolm said.  Williams hasn't been approached by the state to renegotiate the contracts, Malcolm said.  Any attempt by California to force through one-sided changes is unlikely and could backfire for the state by disrupting plans for new power plants, he said.  ""To the extent contracts are changed, financing is going to go away,"" he said.  Downplaying Enron Opportunities   Williams downplayed its ability to capitalize on the recent troubles of market-leader Enron Corp. (ENE), saying it focuses on large, long-term structured deals, not the high-volume, physical-market transactions that Enron dominates, Malcolm said.  Also, TradeSpark - the Internet-based energy exchange in which Williams is a partner - is limited for now in its ability to expand and take volume from Enron's proprietary system EnronOnline because of the horrific losses operator Cantor Fitzgerald (X.CFZ) suffered in the attacks on the World Trade Center.  ""That's interrupted the rapid growth we were seeing,"" Williams Chief Executive Keith Bailey said on the call.  Enron, which accounts for about a quarter of the trade in the country's power and gas markets and which makes a market for those commodities on EnronOnline, has seen its share price fall by a third this week due to uncertainties about its extremely complex financial structure.  Those concerns have raised questions about the business model of EnronOnline, a platform on which Enron is the counterparty in all trades. Those concerns could eventually boost volume on neutral exchanges like TradeSpark.  ""We continue to believe in the neutral platform that TradeSpark offers,"" Malcolm said.  TradeSpark LP was formed by eSpeed Inc. (ESPD), Cantor Fitzgerald (X.CFZ), Shell (RD) unit Coral Energy, Dominion (D), Koch Energy Trading Inc., TXU Corp.'s (TXU) TXU Energy unit and Williams Cos.'

Stocks Expected to Open Lower, Hurt By Weak Economic News  10/25/2001 Dow Jones Business News (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)  A Wall Street Journal Online News Roundup  Stocks are expected to open with losses Thursday, weighed down by disappointing U.S. economic news and the European Central Bank's decision to leave interest rates unchanged. About an hour before the New York Stock Exchange opened, futures on the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index were sharply lower, suggesting that the Dow Jones Industrial Average will post a 94-point loss at the opening bell.  In one of a trio of negative economic reports, the Commerce Department said orders for durable goods, or products expected to last more than three years, tumbled 8.5% in September. That was a much steeper drop than the 0.9% decline forecast by economists surveyed by Thomson Global Markets.  Meanwhile, the Labor Department reported that the number of Americans filing new claims for state unemployment insurance rose to 504,000 for the week ended Oct. 20. That was more than the 500,000 jobless claims expected by economists.  The Labor Department also said that the employment-cost index rose 1% in the third quarter, slightly more than expected. The indicator measures changes in compensation costs, including wages and salaries, as well as costs for employee benefits.  Later, at 10 a.m. EDT, the National Association of Realtors is expected to say that 5.26 million existing homes were sold last month, down from the 5.5 million sold in August.  Prior to release of the economic news, S&P futures had pointed to a weaker opening on Wall Street, after the ECB left rates alone despite growing political pressure for another rate cut to help the stumbling European economy.  In addition to pouring over Thursday's economic reports, investors will spend much of the session sorting through a mountain of earnings reports, said Peter Cardillo, director of research at Westfalia Investments.  Among companies that announced quarterly earnings so far, Dow Chemical said third-quarter net income plunged 84%, hurt by weak demand, substantial price declines and a slew of charges mostly related to acquisition expenses and restructuring at Dow Corning.  Among other stocks to watch, Enron on Wednesday replaced its finance chief, Andrew Fastow, capping a tumultuous day in which the Houston powerhouse saw its stock price continue to fall sharply.  States suing Microsoft are hiring one of the nation's top trial lawyers, signaling they may seek a harsher antitrust remedy than the White House. Meanwhile, the software giant's Windows XP formally makes its debut Thursday.  In key overseas markets, stocks were mixed. London's Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-Share Index was down 1.2% in intraday trading, while Frankfurt's DAX was 0.9% lower. Earlier in the day, Japan's Nikkei 225 average closed with a gain of 0.7%, and Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index rose 0.2%.  In Wednesday's session, Wall Street continued to shrug off disappointing earnings news, and focused instead on hopes that low interest rates and the government's economic-stimulus program will produce a recovery.  Technology issues saw much of the buying, with the Nasdaq Composite Index rising 27.10 points, or 1.6%, to 1731.54. The Dow industrials inched 5.54 points, or 0.1%, higher to close at 9345.62, despite substantial losses in two of its components, Eastman Kodak and AT&T, which issued weak outlooks.  In major U.S. market action Wednesday:  Major stock indexes advanced. But on the Big Board, where 1.34 billion shares traded, 1,374 stocks rose and 1,743 fell. On the Nasdaq, 1.89 billion shares changed hands.  Bonds gained. The 10-year Treasury note rose 13/32, or $4.0625 for each $1,000 invested. The yield, which moves inversely to price, fell to 4.588%. The 30-year bond was up 23/32 to yield 5.330%. Early Thursday, the 10-year note was up 10/32 to yield 4.553% while the long bond was 17/32 higher, yielding 5.303%.  The dollar was mixed. Late in New York, it traded at 122.87 yen, up from 122.68, while the euro rose against the dollar to 89.35 U.S. cents from 89.07. Early Thursday in New York, the dollar bought 123.17 yen and traded at 88.27 cents to the euro.  For continuously updated news from The Wall Street Journal, see WSJ.com at http://wsj.com.

Kaplan Fox Seeks To Recover Losses For Investors Who Purchased E 2001-10-25 12:07 (New York)  Kaplan Fox Seeks To Recover Losses For Investors Who Purchased Enron Corp. Common Stock  NEW YORK, NY -- (INTERNET WIRE) -- 10/25/01 -- Kaplan Fox (kaplanfox.com) has filed a class action against Enron Corp. and certain of the Company's officers and directors in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas.  The suit is brought on behalf of all persons or entities who purchased the common stock of Enron Corporation (""Enron"") (NYSE: ENE) between January 18, 2000 and October 17, 2001, inclusive (the ""Class Period"").  The complaint charges Enron Corp. and certain of its officers and directors with violations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The complaint alleges that during the Class Period, defendants engaged in asset and securities sales to closely related affiliates and interested parties, which disguised Enron's true financial position.  Many of the details of these transactions were hidden from the public.  Defendants used these asset sales to falsely improve Enron's balance sheet, thereby maintaining Enron shares at an artificially inflated price.  Certain Enron executives, who held positions in the affiliates that presented clear conflicts of interest, reaped millions of dollars in personal gains from these transactions.  The complaint further alleges that during the Class Period, Defendants made misleading statements regarding the potential value of Enron's Broadband business, in order to artificially boost Enron's share price.  With knowledge that Enron's Broadband business would never post a profit and was seriously overvalued, Defendants continued to make misleading statements about the Broadband business in order to maintain the share price at its artificially inflated levels. Defendants used the artificially inflated value of Enron's Broadband business to hedge against, in order to gain millions of dollars in financing.  Defendants failed to disclose the risk of these financing arrangements.  Defendants hid the true nature of Enron's earnings, its hedging, its businesses, and the correct state of Enron's finances from its investors and the market, further artificially inflating Enron's share price.  While the stock was artificially inflated for the above reasons, Enron executives engaged in extensive insider trading, gaining personal proceeds of approximately $482 million during the Class Period, before the public became aware of the above practices.  Plaintiff seeks to recover damages on behalf of the Class and is represented by Kaplan Fox & Kilsheimer LLP.

Joe Kernen, co-anchor:                We've got to shift gears into this Enron situation which               has just been--you've been talking about it quite a bit,               David--how could you not talk about it?  Seventy-six               million shares yesterday, down fifty percent in the last               two weeks.  This is a company with--what?--a hundred               million in revenues.                James Cramer, guest market commentator:                Maybe.                Kernen:  Yeah, right.  Anyone who does any trading in               energy apparently, you know, uses Enron Online, so anything               that destabilizes Enron to a great extent could destabilize               the whole energy trading arena and...                Cramer:  Go ahead, say it!  Say what you're thinking!  No               one has said it yet.  We know the truth.  We believe that               Enron caused a national short squeeze.  They knew every               single number in this gas situation.  They wrecked the               California utility system and profited from it.  That's my               bet.  My bet that this--they had--look, they were the               market maker.  Imagine if Instinet knew what you were going               to be buying and took it ahead of you.  I think they               cornered the market for electricity for about four months,               made a huge fortune and now the company is unraveling and               when someone--when the Justice Department gets in there               we're going to discover this.                Kernen:  Let's see what happened...                Haines:  Now, wait a second...                David Faber, co-anchor:                Whoa, whoa, whoa!  The Justice Department, Jim?  Now, is               that new?  Is that something--                Cramer:  No, that would be, if I were a prosecutor,               something...                Faber:  OK, so they are not being investigated?                Cramer:  Well, no, I'm actually being a little forward               thinking.                Kernen:  The SEC wants documents about the limited               partnership transactions of Mr.--                Faber:  Which is very different from what Jim is talking               about.                Cramer:  No, I'm saying that this is what, if I were an               enterprising prosecutor, I would say, Did we have a               nationwide short squeeze in electricity caused by one               company that had access to all the screens and knew exactly               what was happening with the electricity market which then               wrecked the California utility system, cost the consumer               billions of dollars, and is now being hushed up?                Kernen:  Well, let's talk about the actual news.  Here's               yesterday's trading--                Haines:  Wait a minute.                Kernen:  Well, I just want to say that the guy is gone now.               That's the new news here.  Did you read--did you know that               Fastow, after four--                Faber:  Late yesterday.                Kernen:  Yeah, after four o'clock, Fastow is gone.  What's               interesting--                Faber:  He's the CFO--                Kernen:  But he's a new CFO.                Faber:  --who benefitted personally from some of these               off balance sheet partnerships.                Cramer:  Mark, you know, I'm not on thin ice here, I'm not               on thin ice.                Haines:  I just want to make sure we understand that this               is your theory.                Cramer:  This is my theory.                Haines:  OK.                Cramer:  It is just a theory.  It is my opinion.  But I               think we've got to find out more about that short squeeze               that occurred.                Haines:  OK.                Cramer:  We need to find out whether it was orchestrated.                Kernen:  The new CFO might help regain some credibility for               the company because he was the old treasurer who left that               position a year or so ago because of some disagreements               with how Mr. Fastow was doing business apparently.  So now               he's back as CFO and we'll whether that calms the market               down.                Faber:  Well, what they need to do-- Joe, they need to come               clean.  I mean, that is what all the investors in Enron and               those who've left the company as investors over this last               week have wanted.  Let's see everything; be as transparent               as you possibly can be; tell us exactly what we need to               know.  And as much as they need to come clean with their               investors, they need to come clean with their trading               counterparties because that is really what people are               concerned about.                Kernen:  Why is the credit worthiness issue such a big               deal?  Anyone who does trading with them, if their credit               worthiness were to go--if their credit rating were to go               down, how would that affect energy trading?                Faber:  Well, you want to know that they're going to be               there on the other side and make good on the trades.                Kernen:  I guess you would, wouldn't you?                Faber:  Right.  Not that they aren't, but why would you--if               you can trade with seven other guys--seven other companies,               maybe you cut back a little bit on your exposure there.                Kernen:  Now, why would--                Faber:  And that would hurt their core business.                Kernen:  Why are people expecting some type of action from               the credit agencies, not because of the stock price, right?               Because of something that could unravel--                Faber:  Because of something related to these liabilities               they may have--                Kernen:  That they don't know about at this point.                Faber:  --that they may have with regard to funding some of               these off balance sheet partnerships that they backstopped               in terms of borrowing that went on at the project level at               the off balance sheet partnership.  Will it be a liability?               They don't know.  But that's one of the reasons--                Kernen:  We're talking hundreds of millions or billions?                Faber:  They don't know.                Kernen:  But there were billions of dollars in limited               partners?                Faber:  Yes.  About three billion in financing, I think is               what some analysts estimated.                Kernen:  This is a pretty big number.                Faber:  Yeah, they can get to most of that with the assets               that they have in the partnerships themselves.                Kernen:  I use a six month chart to show what's happened               over the last two weeks.  You got to look at here.  But if               we went back a year, you'd see eighty as far as the high               for Enron.  Now we're at sixteen.                Faber:  Everybody else took a hit yesterday.  Dynegy got               hurt.                Kernen:  Well, I got Dynegy next.  Don't--  Here we go.                Faber:  I'm sorry.  I'm getting a little excited.                Kernen:  You are.                Faber:  Enthusiastic about your charts.                Kernen:  There's a weekly chart of Dynegy, and you know               what's coming next, don't you?  Now I'm worried about the               utility average.  I've worried about the transportation               average a lot in my career.  Mark, now the utilities have               replaced my worries.  I'm angst-ridden.  Did you see this               chart?  We're breaking below the--                Cramer:  That's a positive, not a negative, Joe.                Kernen:  What's wrong with Cramer today?  What happened?                Cramer:  I'm all fired up!                Faber:  He really is.  My, God, he's got the DOJ getting               all crazy, the FBI, the CIA.  You going down to En--you               going down to Houston yourself?                Cramer:  I may just have to.  I may have to clean up that               whole city.                Kernen:  Jim, why would the--that's the--now getting down               to the lows, I mean, the other averages have come back               quite a bit from the post-attack lows, the utilities are               retesting those.  That's not something to worry about?                Cramer:  No, because I think there's a lot of money going               into more cyclical issues.  I think the economy is showing               signs of getting better.  The consumer is certainly much               stronger than we thought.  The base book didn't say the               corporate was strong, but the consumer is strong.  Much               stronger than before.                Kernen:  All right.  In the past people have worried about               the utility averages being a leading indicator, though.  I               don't--we're talking about four hundred to two-ninety at               this point.  That's a long way.                Cramer:  This average has got a lot of problems to it, but               I still think that--                Kernen:  It's no longer the--                Cramer:  --you sell this as safety.  We don't want safety               as much as we want a little bit more reciprocality.                          # # #    ",n..gilbert@enron.com,john.arnold@enron.com,FW: Enron Mentions,2001-10-25 12:53:01-07:00,sent

"hi- not sure if you saw this with all the crap going on lately or have seen these contracts trading..one of the traders in Calgary called me Friday- one of his clients called asking about this indirectly.. said that he had heard of a $1B fund that was being set up to replicate the index.. the index is 17.7% nat gas (the highest % of any commodity).. the client wondered if that had anything to do with the nat gas rally!  i am trying to find out info on this $1 B fund.. no luck yet.. it would have a nice impact on the market if the fund had to buy 177M of nat gas contracts- 17,700 contracts in first 2 months..look at the 2 websites- www.nybot.com <http://www.nybot.com> (the futures and options) are traded there and the s+p site www.spglobal.com <http://www.spglobal.com>... the way they manage the futures is interesting..  basic weightings:   energy: 44.29% (natty-17.7, unleaded-9.7%, heat- 12.9, crude-4.12)  grains- 19.28%  meats- 10.98%  metals- 7.96%  softs- 11.98%  fibers- 5.51%  please let me know if you have any info on this.  thanks, c        S&P and NYBOT Launch New Index Futures and Options Contracts  New York, NY, October 19, 2001 - The New York Board of Trade (NYBOT) , in partnership with Standard & Poor's, began trading futures contracts this morning on the S&P Commodity Index (SPCI) - a new standard for commodities pricing. Officials from the New York City Mayor's Office for Economic Development as well as NYBOT and Standard & Poor's presided over the launch.  Standard & Poor's, a leading provider of global financial information and investment analysis, and the New York Board of Trade, a global marketplace for alternative investment products, developed the SPCI to bring greater definition to traded commodities as an investable asset class. The SPCI was introduced at a ceremony at NYBOT on August 9, 2001. The SPCI futures and options allow managers and investors to add real diversification to their portfolios through a single, transparent access point to the investment opportunities found in commodity futures markets.   ""The launch of this new product so soon after the events of September 11, and on a trading floor so imaginatively developed before the event, allowing NYBOT to start trading so soon after the loss of its facility in lower Manhattan, is a testament to the strength and the resilience of New Yorkers,"" said Michael G. Carey, President, New York City Economic Development Corporation. ""Let no one doubt that New York is and continues to be the financial and trading capital of the world.""  ""To contribute successfully to long-term portfolio goals, an alternative asset should have certain key characteristics, namely a proper benchmark, transparency, liquidity, simplicity, cost efficiency and flexible trading capabilities,"" said NYBOT President and CEO Mark D. Fichtel. ""SPCI futures and options are among the few investment instruments that meet all the criteria for a real alternative asset. We believe that these new contracts will prove particularly valuable to investors and managers who need alternative investment strategies in these difficult economic times.""  The NYBOT SPCI futures contract lists six active contract months (January, February, April, June, August, November). Expiration is the second Friday of the listed futures contract month, and the contract is cash settled. The futures contract is valued at $100 x the Index (current contract value approximately $100,000). Trading hours initially will be 10:00 AM to 4:00 PM (New York Time). Options on futures are also offered (see contract specifications).   ""SPCI futures and options give investors a direct means to obtain exposure to a diversified commodity basket,"" said Robert Shakotko, Standard & Poor's Managing Director of Index Services. ""Investors around the world recognize the S&P reputation for equity indices and index products. We now bring these same business strengths to commodities.""   The SPCI tracks 17 commodities in six sectors including grains, meat and livestock, metals, softs (coffee, sugar, cocoa), fibers, and energy. The index utilizes real-time prices of the relevant futures contracts traded on the commodities futures markets in New York and Chicago. Key features of the SPCI include its geometric calculation methodology and a weighting adjustment that eliminates double counting of upstream and downstream commodities.   The new SPCI futures and options contracts will support and enhance other index-linked investment products. They offer an easy and efficient way to manage commodity index funds, commodity-linked insurance products, or commodity exposure in multi-asset products. As with its equity indices, Standard & Poor's has initiated a licensing program for the SPCI directed at financial institutions that might use the new commodity index as part of an innovative investment product.  End-of-day index values and index history are available through both the S&P Index Services website at www.spglobal.com <http://www.spglobal.com/indexmaincommodity.html> and NYBOT's Website at www.nybot.com <http://www.nybot.com/>. The SPCI is calculated every 15 seconds and is available through traditional real-time quote vendors via the NYBOT; the ticker symbol will be 'I'.   Standard & Poor's, a division of The McGraw-Hill Companies (NYSE: MHP), provides independent financial information, analytical services, and credit ratings to the world's financial markets. Among the company's many products are the S&P Global 1200, the first real-time, global equity index, the S&P 500, the premier U.S. portfolio index, and credit ratings on more than 220,000 securities and funds worldwide.

Robert Collins, Jr., President  RE: EXCHANGE ANNOUNCES PLANS TO INTRODUCE OVER-THE-COUNTER CLEARING     EXCHANGE ANNOUNCES PLANS TO INTRODUCE OVER-THE-COUNTER CLEARING  The board of directors of the New York Mercantile Exchange, Inc., last night approved a series of measures to offer credit intermediation through clearing services and trading tools for the over-the-counter (OTC) natural gas market.  This plan will include the introduction of exchange of futures for swap (EFS) transactions and large order execution to the natural gas futures market within the next few weeks, along with the previously announced electronic trading of cleared natural gas swaps and basis contracts.  Recent events in the natural gas market have served to reinforce the necessity of counterparty credit risk management and have accelerated the Exchange's plans to introduce a full array of risk management tools under the umbrella of our clearinghouse.  Combining these trading vehicles with our Henry Hub futures contract will offer market participants the advantages of these instruments in conjunction with one of the most liquid commodity markets in the world and provide greater stability to the market as a whole.  The Exchange is in a unique leadership position to offer these services with natural gas futures and options volume in 2000 reaching the equivalent of approximately 230 trillion cubic feet and the notional value of last year's transactions Exchange-wide totaling $3 trillion, or $14 billion per day. One half billion dollars is available to participants on each of the Exchange divisions through each guarantee fund and the respective clearing members.  EFS transactions will work similarly to exchange of futures for physical (EFP) transactions.  Two parties will be allowed to privately negotiate the execution of an integrated over-the-counter swaps and related futures transaction on pricing terms agreed upon by the involved parties.  The transaction must involve approximately equal but opposite side-of-market quantities of futures and swap exposures in the same or related commodities and will be permitted until two hours after trading terminates in the underlying futures contract.  EFS transactions will be permitted to liquidate, initiate, and transfer futures market positions between the two parties involved in the transaction.  The clearing member representing each party will be responsible to notify the Exchange of the amount and type of futures contracts involved, the price at which the futures transaction should be cleared, and the identity of the parties involved.  The Exchange will also begin permitting traders to execute block trades of 250 natural gas futures contracts or more in the first two nearby months at the best bid or offer for that size.  These trades will not be permitted during the closing range.  Early next year, the Exchange will introduce a cleared Henry Hub natural gas swaps contract, providing the marketplace with direct clearing on the most popular energy swaps contract over the last several year.  As part of this move, the Exchange will clear OTC-executed transactions through its EFS mechanism.

Nymex indicated that they would like to move ahead very quickly on getting a price posting arrangement with them on Access where they will be showing prices all day including the OTC products.  Once this is complete they would also like to contemplate an arrangement on a Phase 2 technology sale with them.  They are currently scoping our the Phase II requirements.  Nymex does not have the resources to build the API (interface with EnronOnline) and would like us to do the development.  This type of arrangement requires the desk to make some decisions:  Are we willing to post numbers on Access electronically and have the transaction occur on Access?  This will give us the risk of being double hit.  Are we willing to dedicate technology resources to this effort (and away from other EnronOnline priorities) and will the desk get enough benefits to justify the opportunity costs?  What would it take for you to post numbers in this fashion (fees, preferential fills, etc).  You have the original specialist proposal we sent to them.   We indicated to Bo that we would get an answer on this and call in the next couple of days.  If we can answer these questions, Jay will have someone look at the Access code and determine the cost to us (development time).  We will also be meeting with Nymex next Wed to talk about Phase II.  We think that we can structure a transaction that would include an Access Price Posting in the short term, Specialist role and an obligation to look at our Phase II proposal.  If we do not get a firm commitment on Phase II within a specified period we can review our specialist role and ask them to pay for the API we built to access.

Houston, Nov. 7 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp.'s shares fell as much as 28 percent, to their lowest level in more than a decade, amid reports that the No. 1 energy trader is struggling to find investors to help it out of a cash crunch.       Shares of Enron fell $1.17, or 12 percent, to $8.50 in midafternoon trading. The shares dropped to $7 earlier. At yesterday's close, they had fallen 88 percent this year.       Enron will have a hard time raising a large amount of cash in a short time, said Sean Egan, managing director of Egan-Jones Rating Co.       ``It takes time to sell assets, and many shrewd investors like Goldman Sachs might find it more profitable to just pluck off key employees rather than invest in Enron,'' Egan said.       The shares pared some of today's losses after CNBC reported that Enron is talking with rival Dynegy Inc. about options, including a merger. Both companies are based in Houston.       ``We don't comment on market rumors,'' Dynegy spokesman Steve Stengel said.       ``Enron does not comment on speculation on mergers and acquisitions,'' Enron spokesman Mark Palmer said.       Berkshire Hathaway Inc. Chairman Warren Buffett decided against investing in Enron because he wasn't willing to sign a confidentiality agreement that would keep him from trading Enron's debt, the New York Times reported today, citing an unidentified person close to the talks.       Other companies approached by Enron, including Clayton Dubilier & Rice, the Blackstone Group and Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. have also shown little interest, the newspaper said.       The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating Enron partnerships run by the company's former chief financial officer. The entities bought and sold Enron shares and assets, with trades costing Enron $35 million and $1.2 billion in lost shareholder equity. Enron ousted CFO Andrew Fastow last month.                           Rating Downgraded       Standard & Poor's today reduced its rating on Enron's credit- linked notes, just six days after the ratings company downgraded Enron's senior unsecured bonds. S&P cut four Enron credit-linked issues valued at about $1.36 billion combined to ``BBB'' from ``BBB+'' and indicated it may lower the grades again.       Fearing that an Enron collapse might cripple the natural gas- derivatives market, oil and gas producer Apache Corp. said it backed out of most of its gas hedges, realizing a $70 million gain so far.       ``We have been unwinding our hedge positions because of uncertainty created by Enron's credit problems,'' Apache spokesman Bill Mintz said. The company now has only one position with Enron that it's trying to unwind.       The Apache news was reported earlier by the Times.                          `Fragile Business'       ``Their trading business is a very fragile business,'' Egan said. ``If partners on either side get concerned, trading volumes decline, which is what is happening now.''       Other companies mentioned in reports as possible buyers of all or part of Enron have denied an interest in the idea. General Electric Co. Chief Executive Officer Jeffrey Immelt told CNN today that ``Enron's really not on our list right now.'' BP Plc Chief Executive John Browne said ``no'' at a press conference in London yesterday when asked whether the London-based company would be interested in buying Enron or a stake in the company.       Among shares of other energy traders, Dynegy fell $1.70 to $34.30. Mirant Corp. fell 15 cents to $25.40. Williams Cos. fell 4 cents to $28.97.  --Margot Habiby in Houston, (713) 353-4872=20   Enron Credit-Linked Note Ratings Reduced 6 Days Late (Update2) 2001-11-07 14:46 (New York)  Enron Credit-Linked Note Ratings Reduced 6 Days Late (Update2)       (Adds background and stock price in fourth through sixth paragraphs.)       New York, Nov. 7 (Bloomberg) -- Standard & Poor's Corp. downgraded notes linked to Enron Corp.'s credit quality to match the No. 1 energy trader's credit rating six days after the ratings company reduced its corporate debt ratings.       S&P said it cut four Enron credit-linked notes, valued at $1.36 billion, to ``BBB'' from ``BBB+'', and indicated it may lower the grades again.       ``This isn't an additional downgrade and should have happened last week,'' said Todd Shipman, a director at the ratings company that follows the company. Last week Shipman downgraded Enron's long-term ratings to ``BBB'' from ``BBB+,'' and left them on watch for a further downgrade.       Enron shares today fell as much as 28 percent, to their lowest level in more than a decade, amid reports that the No. 1 energy trader is struggling to find investors to help it out of a cash crunch.       Shares of Enron fell $1.17, or 12 percent, to $8.50 in mid- afternoon trading. The shares dropped to $7 earlier. At yesterday's close, they had fallen 88 percent this year.       The federal Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating Enron partnerships run by the company's former chief financial officer, Andrew Fastow, who was ousted last month. The entities bought and sold Enron shares and assets, with trades costing Enron $35 million and $1.2 billion in lost shareholder equity.                                 Notes       Holders of the credit-linked notes, sold by Enron Euro CLN Trust, Enron Sterling CLN Trust, and Enron CLN Trust and Trust II, may have received a higher coupon than an Enron corporate obligation offers. The notes, which are obligations of the special purpose entities, are tied to specific credit events, such as a bankruptcy or Enron's failure to pay on obligations.       Proceeds from the notes were to be used to acquire the Trusts' initial investments, and buyers are to be paid interest from the proceeds of those certain assets, according to an offering memorandum. The Trusts can invest in securities with short-term ratings of at least ``A1'' from S&P and ``P1'' from Moody's Investors Service, as long as they mature before the maturity dates of the notes.       There are four notes, each divided into two offerings, some offered publicly and some privately sold. All the notes are scheduled to mature in August 2005 or May 2006 and were sold by a group of banks led by Salomon Smith Barney, a unit of Citigroup.       In the event of an Enron credit event, Citibank, which acted as a swap counter-party to the trusts, can take the trusts' investments in return for Enron debt obligations. The Enron debt is then liquidated by the trust, with the proceeds paid to the investors.       Neither Enron nor Citibank have direct obligations to the holders of the notes, according to an offering memorandum.       Enron's credit-linked notes utilize a credit-default swap that the trusts have with Citibank that references Enron's senior unsecured debt, so the rating on the credit-linked notes will reflect the senior unsecured rating, S&P said in a report.  --Liz Goldenberg and Terence Flanagan in the New York=20  Former SEC Chairman Levitt (Transcript of Interview) 2001-11-07 12:52 (New York)        ****THE FOLLOWING IS AN UNOFFICIAL TRANSCRIPT.**** BLOOMBERG L.P. DOES NOT GUARANTEE THE ACCURACY OF THIS TRANSCRIPT.       New York, Nov. 7 (Bloomberg) -- The following is a transcript of a Bloomberg interview with Former Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chairman Arthur Levitt.  The reporter is Dylan Ratigan.       RATIGAN:  As you've probably heard, Enron under investigation by the SEC, the SEC looking into partnerships run by their former CFO.  If you come into the Bloomberg with me, I want to show you what it's done to the stock price here over the course of the past month, month and a half.  You're talking about a move from a price in the mid 40s, which was not that long ago, mind you, early mid- October, to a price that is now $9.67 a share.  This has absolutely decimated the company's stock price.  Arthur Levitt, the former chairman of the SEC, with us, looking, first of all, at what's going on with this company.       But, before I do that, let me say good morning to you.       LEVITT:  Good morning, Dylan.       RATIGAN:  Talk to me.       LEVITT:  You know, there are certain warning signs here that investors have to be careful of:  related party transactions.  Anytime you see a related party transaction, an investor should be very careful.  What they were doing, was they were simply setting up these partnerships to move off the balance sheet acquisitions and borrowings that would really have hurt the balance sheet and I think given investors a very different picture.       RATIGAN:  Well, let's just make it real clear to people, because they can easily get confused.  I'm a company.       LEVITT:  Yes.       RATIGAN:  .and I create - and I'm an executive of that company, and I create a partnership that has nothing to do with that company, legally, on paper.       LEVITT:  But all the risks and rewards still belong to the parent company.  The affect of this is the subsidiary borrows the money to make the acquisition from another partnership set up by the parent. This stays totally off the balance sheet of the parent company.  Why does this happen?       RATIGAN:  So, in other words, Company ABC exists, they set up Subsidiary 123.       LEVITT:  Yes.       RATIGAN:  Subsidiary company 123 borrows money from.       LEVITT:  To make an acquisition.       RATIGAN:  A bank?       LEVITT:  No.       RATIGAN:  They borrow money from who?       LEVITT:  They issue bonds.       RATIGAN:  OK.  They borrow money from the world.       LEVITT:  Yes.       RATIGAN:  . whoever wants to lend them money.       LEVITT:  Yes.       RATIGAN:  . they borrow money, they make an acquisition.  Now Subsidiary 123 down here has big debts that don't reflect upstairs on Company ABC?       LEVITT:  Precisely.       RATIGAN:  But ABC still gets to use the asset that was bought by 123?       LEVITT:  Yes.       RATIGAN:  OK.       LEVITT:  Exactly.  Now, how does it happen?  The accounting firm that handled this transaction, Arthur Andersen, received $25 million for an audit of the company - that's a huge amount - and $27 million for consulting services - another danger sign.  A lot of dough.  Those consulting services were to validate these transactions; $52 million dollars went to the accountants.  The problem here is an audit committee was not doing its work.  If you look at Enron's statements - and how many times have we heard they were confusing?  It's the job of the auditing firm to see to it that it is not confusing.  That's the real problem.  Now, what can you do about it?       RATIGAN:  Tell me.       LEVITT:  I think, actually, the FASB, the independent standards setter, could put through a rule, which says.       RATIGAN:  And FASB is the Federal Accounting Standards Board.  They set the rules.       LEVITT:  Yes.  Located in Norwalk, Connecticut.  They could say, if a company sets up another legal entity, and the company retains all the risks and rewards of that entity, then the public company, that public company that set up these entities, must consolidate in the P&L, in the balance sheet, all of these transactions.       Now, how does that come about?  I think the SEC could urge the FASB to do this.  In 1990, the present chief accountant of the SEC called for that action to be taken place, but at that point, the then-chief accountant didn't support the move.       RATIGAN:  And this creates, in your mind, a rallying call to reiterate that request with more venom and more passion than before?       LEVITT:  I don't know about venom, but I.       RATIGAN:  But with passion.       LEVITT:  I certainly think that passion - I think this is clearly a call for better disclosure.       RATIGAN:  Fair enough.  I will see you next week, OK?       LEVITT:  Good.  Nice to see you.       RATIGAN:  You, too.       ***END OF TRANSCRIPT***   USA: U.S. FERC watching Enron's impact on energy markets.  11/07/2001 Reuters English News Service (C) Reuters Limited 2001.

The complaint was broug= ht against defendants Enron, Kenneth Lay, Jeffrey K. Skilling and Andrew Fa= stow. The case is numbered H-01-3736. The Honorable Melinda Harmon is the J= udge presiding over the case.=20 The Complaint alleges that defendants violated Section 10(b) and 20(a) of t= he Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 by issuing a series of material misr= epresentations to the market between January 18, 2000 and October 17, 2001,=  thereby artificially inflating the price of Enron common stock. Specifical= ly, the Complaint alleges that Enron issued a series of statements concerni= ng its business, financial results and operations which failed to disclose = (i) that the Company's Broadband Services Division was experiencing declini= ng demand for bandwidth and the Company's efforts to create a trading marke= t for bandwidth were not meeting with success as many of the market partici= pants were not creditworthy; (ii) that the Company's operating results were=  materially overstated as a result of the Company failing to timely write-d= own the value of its investments with certain limited partnerships which we= re managed by the Company's chief financial officer; and (iii) that Enron w= as failing to write-down impaired assets on a timely basis in accordance wi= th Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (""GAAP""). During the Class Peri= od, Enron insiders disposed of over $73 million of their personally-held En= ron common stock to unsuspecting investors. On October 16, 2001, Enron surprised the market by announcing that the Comp= any was taking non-recurring charges of $1.01 billion after-tax, or ($1.11)=  loss per diluted share, in the third quarter of 2001, the period ending Se= ptember 30, 2001. Subsequently, Enron revealed that a material portion of t= he charge was related to the unwinding of investments with certain limited = partnerships which were controlled by Enron's chief financial officer and t= hat the Company would be eliminating more than $1 billion in shareholder eq= uity as a result of its unwinding of the investments. When this news hit th= e market, the price of Enron common stock dropped significantly.=20 Plaintiff is represented by the law firm of Rabin & Peckel LLP.

The revelations came Wednesday as Enron's stock (ENE: news, chart, profile)=  plunged 24 percent following news that Standard & Poor's cut its ratings f= or the company's credit-linked notes to two notches above junk status.  ""Everybody's trying to balance out their exposure to Enron as best they can= ,"" said an energy trader who spoke on condition of anonymity. ""That means n= ot doing business or minimizing their business with Enron.""  1 of 4 energy trades  Traders' attempts to isolate the company underscore concerns about the stab= ility of the overall energy-trading market, in which Enron is involved in 1=  out of every 4 trades.=20  However, some industry watchers are confident that the energy market can su= rvive if Houston-based Enron were to disappear.  ""Even though they quote-unquote make the market, the market exists whether = Enron is there or not,"" said Phil Flynn, senior markets analyst at Alaron.c= om. ""Those that think this is the end of energy trading have another thing = coming.""  Enron, its shares trading at levels not seen since 1992, saw the stock fall=  $2.27 to $7.40 on in afternoon volume of 58 million.  On Wednesday, Standard & Poor's, which just last week downgraded Enron's co= rporate credit rating, cut the rating on the credit-linked notes of Enron C= redit Linked Notes Trusts to BBB from BBB-plus. S&P also added a ""Watch neg= ative"" designation, meaning the rating agency is poised to issue further do= wngrades if warranted.=20  ""The CreditWatch placements recognize the uncertainties that surround the c= ompany and its credit quality in the short run due to the possibility of fu= rther anticipated developments in the capital markets,"" the rating agency w= rote.  Wednesday's downgrade affects $500 million worth of notes, which are deriva= tives linked to Enron's senior unsecured debt, now rated BBB.  ""The investors are taking the risk of Enron credit"" by purchasing the secur= ities from the trusts even though these are not issued by Enron,"" said Tom = Fritz, a Standard & Poor's managing director.  In addition, Standard & Poor's cut to BBB Yosemite Securities Co. Series 20= 00-A. The obligations use Enron's corporate rating as a backstop.=20  The counterparty to Yosemite and the credit-linked notes is Citibank, Fritz=  said. Last week, J.P. Morgan joined with Salomon Smith Barney, which along=  with Citibank is a unit of Citigroup (C: news, chart, profile), to extend = $1 billion in new credit to Enron to help the company's liquidity.  'Not business as usual'  ""With these downgrades, it's not business as usual,"" the energy trader said= . ""We're already in the process of losing a counterparty that contributed a=  good deal of liquidity to the energy-trading market.""  The trader cited Calpine (CPN: news, chart, profile), Dynegy (DYN: news, ch= art, profile), and El Paso Energy (EPG: news, chart, profile) as energy tra= ders that have a chance to gain market share, but he conceded that Enron wo= n't be replaced overnight, should it cease to exist.  ""Energy trading won't be destroyed at all,"" the trader said. ""It will certa= inly be diminished but not gone.""  What Enron's absence would do is make it more difficult for lesser creditwo= rthy companies to participate in the market. Exchanges such as the New York=  Mercantile Exchange and the Intercontinental Exchange may gain a higher pr= ofile.=20  Both of them are trying to establish a clearinghouse for the unregulated ma= rket for derivative-energy transactions, as the NYMEX already does with fut= ures.=20  In other news, Enron is preparing to close most of its Asian broadband tele= communications business, part of a global restructuring that comes as the c= ompany is seeking a capital infusion of as much as $2 billion to help it th= rough a financial crisis. See previous story.  ""Poor demand for broadband is being exacerbated by falling prices, requirin= g Enron to consider the best options for managing its global broadband busi= ness,"" according to a recent company memo obtained by CBS.MarketWatch.com.

The United States Justice Foundation intends to sue in Sacramento County Superior Court, said Richard D. Ackerman, lead counsel on the case for the group. The USJF wants a court to terminate the long-term power contracts and require money already paid to the generators to be returned to the state.       The USJF proposes a class action to represent California taxpayers and alleges violations of the state's business and open- meeting laws. Ackerman said his group may need to forge new law to succeed in the case.       ``You're gonna have some serious legal battles that may go to the appeals level in this case,'' Ackerman said.       California officials last spring signed about $43 billion in long-term power contracts after two investor-owned utilities became insolvent. Governor Gray Davis has said the contracts were needed to bring stability to California's energy market. Since then, the cost of power has dropped, leaving California with contracts to buy electricity above spot-market prices.       Enron Corp., Southern California Edison Company, Pacific Gas & Electric Company, Green Mountain Energy, San Diego Gas & Electric Company, Reliant Energy Company, PacifiCorp Power Marketing, Inc., Alliance Colton LLC, and Calpine Energy Company have electricity contracts with the state, according to a USJF press release.       The USJF said it sent a letter to California officials giving them notice of its intent to sue. The group, which calls itself ``Your conservative voice in the courts'' on its Web site, is supported by individual donations, Ackerman said.  --Michael B.

It's an excerpt from an analyst's note out this AM.  A Perspective: R.I.P. Enron: It took sixteen years to build Enron into a $63 billion asset powerhouse, but only 24 days for it to disintegrate.  The fatal flaw was the aggressive accounting and leveraging done in various off balance sheet partnerships (Special Purpose Entities), which apparently became too aggressive to fully disclose. Wall Street had no idea of their holdings, their leverage or their derivative exposures. The SPEs mutated into something beyond the pale, becoming a company within a company. This evidently began 30 months ago when the new management regime (Skilling, Fastow, et al) sanctioned their evolution. Make no mistake: they were cleverly contrived. They involved conventional asset & debt transfers off the books, coupled with fair value (asset mark-to-market) accounting and synthetic equity financing. This allowed for considerable earnings management and the appearance of cost-free equity.  If nothing else, they now appear in hindsight to have been vanity deals: very New Economy, very Virtual and very aggressive. But no clients ever complained, to our knowledge. Yet ENE clearly crossed the GAAP reporting lines, as the latest 8-K attests, and the dual role of the CFO (sitting on both sides of the table in the LJM transactions), profiting highly in the process, created in the LJM partnership natural conflicts of interest now being investigated by the SEC. Because of this elementary mistake in any seasoned judgment, which passed muster at every level, the most successful energy company of the 90s was vaporized in the marketplace. The main thing that brought ENE down was hubris. It had used up all of its credibility when the partnerships were brought to light. If these were fully revealed two years ago, a collapse would have been very unlikely.

And it appears that we have found some  winners.  While all the wines have been well-received, the ones below have  gained a serious following in just three short weeks.  To  give the rest of you a chance to see what all the buzz is about, and to help the  regulars re-stock their wine racks after the Thanksgiving feast, I have put  together our most recent sampler.  As always, it comes with a special  price, too.

"Hey John!  How are you??  I've been following the Enron story closely, which means I've thought of you a lot recently.  I hope things are going well, despite the uncertainty.  I ran into someone from our Enron days today, which made me think of a funny story.  Do you remember when John Mee tried to eat 8 Big Macs and hurled instead?  John was talking to my boss, Chuck Clough, today, who he's known since childhood and is a mentor of sorts.  When he got off the phone, Chuck told me who he was talking to and the name John Mee struck me as familiar. I asked Chuck if he was a big kid who'd gone to Harvard and he said yes.  So I tell him the Big Mac story and Chuck picks up the phone and calls John to ask him if that was him because if so, I knew him.  Poor thing says ""yeah, that was me, but not one of my finer moments...""  I could tell he was embarrassed.  I guess there are some things in life you just never live down.  I also ran into some friends of yours in Bermuda last month.  We shared a cab to the airport and realized we had all been at Enron, though not at the same time.  I mentioned that I really loved the company, especially how young it was and that I had a friend who joined right out of undergrad and is now doing really well.  They immediately said ""John Arnold!""  Shocked the hell out of me, honestly.  They were very funny in saying that I had made a ""bad trade"" by marrying my husband instead of you.  I told them I would keep that in mind....  ;-}  I would tell you their names, but I can't remember off the top of my head.  They both work for a weather trading firm in the Northeast now, with Lynda Clemmons.  Well, gotta run to the gym - been putting it off as long as I could today. I really do hope you're doing well.  Please drop me a line when you aren't trading up a storm...

Do you have a bar code or any type of serial number for me to be able to find it?  I don't see how the computer could have just dissappeared. When Dutch originally talked to Paul Jordan and told him that it was not being used anymore, he was going to have it moved. Who else can we talk to about where this computer could have gone?  I will go over to the new building tommorrow and take a look again.  Will you meet me there?  I will call you before I go.

" Crude is giving a potential sell scenario for Friday.   While the market has been all over the map, I have the possibility of a lower  high on the same daily strength pattern.  March crude saw a recent high of  2037 on 1/28.  A particular daily strength pattern appeared from that  day.  Tomorrow, Friday, should March trade above 1950, the same daily  strength pattern will show up.  A down close for the day is a sell  signal.  I am also getting better hourly strength patterns from Thursday's  late action than what was seen at the 2037 high.  This sets up a bearish  divergence back down and a minimum target back under 1856.  I have an  hourly sell signal once crude takes out the low of the highest hourly bar.   Call if any questions.
