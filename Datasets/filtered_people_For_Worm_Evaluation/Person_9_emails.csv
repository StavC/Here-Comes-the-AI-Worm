"I have place the amendment with your revisions and ours with my attorney for  review.  Hopefully  I will receive it back today.   In Section 4.2 we  increased the event for Enron Corp. to 100m and Idacorp, Inc. to 50 m.  In  addition to this I changed the date of the Amendment to July 1, 2000, changed  the name to reflect Enron North America Corp. and finally to Section 4.6 the  following: Collateral Requirement/Termination Threshold is hereby amended by  the addition thereto after the last sentence: ""For purposes of this Section  4.6, the calculation of ""Early Termination Payment"" shall include all amounts  owed but not yet paid by one Party whether or not such amounts are then due,  for performance already provided pursuant to any and all Transactions.""  These are the only changes we have made.  Pending my attorney's review we  should be ready.  I will e-mail the new version as soon as I receive it.

Tricia,  I've uncovered some troubling information regarding the issue with Hall  Energy Company and Willis Enterprises Corp. based on the info you sent me.   Apparently, at one time, Enron was assigned a Committed Reserves contract  with Hall Energy Company (Global #96003960) originally signed 05/07/84,  effective with first production 10/04/84, that is still effective.  Two deals  were entered in Sitara under this contract, covering 02/98 and 04/98  production.  From 05/98 production on, deals were tied to a GTC Purchase Spot  contract (Global #96014936).    I'm not sure why the GTC was set up when we had a purchase contract already  in place; it appears that this GTC covers the same well (Stewart #1) that the  Committed Reserves contract covers.  Not only that, but a point was set up  under the GTC (we don't set up points under GTCs, only under Committed  Reserves).  It was the same point under the Committed Reserves contract.   Also, later deals entered in Sitara even include this exact meter used for  the GTC.  You also included documentation from Hall authorizing payments to Willis.   I've reviewed all contract and correspondence files for this contract and can  find absolutely NO documentation showing that Willis in an interest owner in  this well.  Do you have any division orders or other assignments showing that  Willis has an interest in the Stewart #1?  If that's the case, I can add  Willis as a seller under the Committed Reserves and we can have all deals  moved to the original contract.  However, Willis still will not receive a  separate payment.  Enron will only issue payment to the counterparty on the  contract (the operator) so Willis will have to receive payment from Hall.  A GTC Purchase Spot contract (Global #96007659) was also set up for Willis  Enterprises Corp.  That could technically have been for separate purchases,  but more recent deals in Sitara show that these purchases were from the same  meter point for the Stewart #1 that the GTC for Hall used.  I can find no  documentation on either of the Hall or Willis GTCs to reflect that these were  set up to handle different wells than the one in question.  Without any other  paper, it is my guess that both the Hall GTC (96014936) and the Willis GTC  (96007659) were set up in error.  The people responsible for setting up the  contracts are no longer around and would probably not remember anything if  they were.  I would like to run this by Legal, but my inclination is to  cancel both GTCs and settle under the Committed Reserves contract set up  originally for Hall.  I will forward this information to Legal to see how to  proceed.  I know all this is confusing, but please let me know if you have any  additional documentation from Willis or if you have any questions.  I will  turn this matter over to Cyndie Balfour-Flanagan (who handles the ""H""  counterparties) and she will let you know the outcome.  Of course, you can  always call me with questions, but this is really her domain since the  contract in question is with Hall.

I look forward to working with you once again.  In light of the upcoming addition to our wholesale energy business, this email confirms our request to establish a gas purchase and sale agreement between your organization and Constellation Power Source, Inc.(""CPS""). According to our business structure, our affiliate company in Houston, TX, Constellation Energy Source, Inc.(""CES""), was previously handling all of the wholesale natural gas business on behalf of our organization.  It is expected that CES will cease operations by April '01 and the wholesale gas trading activity will be conducted through our newly formed Gas Desk located within the CPS' offices in Baltimore, MD. I have already contacted CES in an attempt to gather contracts and determine whether an assignment or the termination and reissuing of a new agreement between us would be the most feasible mean to proceed with our gas trading activity in a timely fashion.  ENA  has been identified by our Gas Desk as one of the potential counterparties for gas trading in the year 2001.  CPS will initiate gas trading as early as January 29th, 2001. Considering this, I am looking forward to receiving a copy of your master agreement for our review and consideration.  Such can be forwarded to me via email at the earliest convenience.  I thank you in advance for your assistance and prompt response to our request and look forward to working with you in the near future.  Do not hesitate to contact me if there are any further inquiries to this request. I will make a note to follow up with you during the first week of January '01.

"ENFOLIO MASTER FIRM PURCHASE/SALE AGREEMENT  GUARANTY AGREEMENT   This Guaranty Agreement (this ""Guaranty""), dated as of ________, is made and  entered into between ________________, a ___________ corporation (""Guarantor ""), and ______________________, a _____________ ___________ (""Contract  Party"").   WHEREAS, (i) Contract Party and ____________________, a wholly owned  subsidiary of Guarantor (""Obligor""), are contemplating entering into an  ENFOLIO Master Firm Purchase/Sale Agreement of even date here-with and herein  incorporated for all purposes (said Agreement, as the same may be from time  to time extended, amended and supplemented, particularly including, without  limitation, all Transactions thereunder, the ""Gas Contract""), (ii) Guarantor  will directly or indirectly benefit from the Gas Contract and (iii) as a  condition precedent to the consummation of the Gas Contract, Contract Party  has required that Guarantor unconditionally guarantee to Contract Party all  payment obligations of Obligor under the Gas Contract.   NOW THEREFORE, to induce Contract Party to enter into the Gas Contract,  Guarantor agrees as follows:    1.  PAYMENT GUARANTY.  Guarantor absolutely, irrevocably and unconditionally  guarantees to Contract Party all payment obligations of Obligor set forth in  the Gas Contract and interest thereon accrued as provided in the Gas Contract  (the ""Obligations""); provided, the applicable rate of interest shall never  exceed the maximum lawful rate permitted by law.  This guaranty of payment is  a continuing guaranty effective during the term of the Gas Contract and until  complete performance by Obligor of its obligations under the Gas Contract and  payment in full of all Obligations; provided, in all instances this Guaranty  shall continue for a period of six months after the termination of the Gas  Contract for the purpose of guaranteeing indemnity Obligations which survive  the termination of the Gas Contract as set forth in Section 8.4 of the Gas  Contract (the ""Indemnity Period"").  With respect to any Claims threatened or  filed as of the close of the Indemnity Period, the Obligations resulting from  any such Claims shall be guaranteed hereunder.  No notice of the Obligations  or any Transaction need be given in any form to Guarantor at any time and  Guarantor WAIVES any such notice and the right to consent to the Obligations  or any Transaction.  Guarantor WAIVES any right to require as a condition to  its obligations hereunder that (i) collateral be applied to the Obligations,  (ii) presentment or demand be made upon Obligor or (iii) action be brought  against Obligor or any other person or entity except Guarantor, should  Contract Party seek to enforce the obligations of Guarantor.  Specifically,  without limitation, Guarantor WAIVES any right to require, substantively or  procedurally, that (i) a judgment previously be rendered against Obligor or  any other person or entity except Guarantor, (ii) Obligor or any other person  or entity be joined in any action against Guarantor or (iii) an action  separate from one against Guarantor be brought against Obligor or any other  person or entity.  The obligations of Guarantor are several from those of  Obligor or any other person or entity, including, without limitation, any  other surety for Obligor, and are primary payment obligations concerning  which Guarantor is the principal obligor.  To the extent Obligor shall fail  to timely make payment of any Obligations, Guarantor shall satisfy its  obligations hereunder regardless of whether Contract Party or any other  person or entity shall have taken any steps to enforce its rights against  Obligor or any other person or entity except Guarantor.  The obligations of  Guarantor hereunder shall in no way be affected or impaired by reason, and  Guarantor WAIVES its right to prior notice, of the happening from time to  time of any of the following:  (i) extensions (whether or not material) of  the time for payment of all or any portion of the Obligations, (ii) the  modification or amendment in any manner (whether or not material) of the Gas  Contract or the Obligations, (iii) except for applicable statutes of  limitations, any failure, delay or lack of diligence on the part of Contract  Party, or any other person or entity to enforce, assert or exercise any  right, privilege, power or remedy conferred on Contract Party or any other  person or entity in the Gas Contract or at law, or any action on the part of  Contract Party or such other person or entity granting indulgence or  extension of any kind, (iv) the settlement or compromise of any Obligations,  (v) the status, composition, structure or name of Obligor change, including,  without limitation, by reason of merger, dissolution, consolidation or  reorganization, (vi) except for releases or waivers resulting from the rights  or defenses of Obligor that Guarantor has reserved in Section 3, the release  or waiver, by operation of law or otherwise, of the performance or observance  by Obligor of any express or implied covenant, term or condition in the Gas  Contract, (vii) the release or waiver, by operation of law or otherwise, of  the performance or observance by any co-guarantor, surety, endorser or other  obligor of any express or implied covenant, term or condition to be performed  or observed by it under the Gas Contract or related document and (viii) the  failure to acquire, perfect or maintain perfection of any lien on, or  security interest in, any collateral provided by Obligor to Contract Party or  the release of any such collateral or the release, modification or waiver of,  or failure to enforce, any pledge, security device, guaranty, surety or other  indemnity agreement in respect of such collateral.  Notwithstanding the  foregoing, the liability of Guarantor hereunder shall be limited to direct,  actual damages and, unless expressly provided in the Gas Contract, Guarantor  shall not be liable for consequential, incidental, punitive, exemplary or  indirect damages, LOST PROFITS OR OTHER BUSINESS INTERRUPTION DAMAGES, in  tort, contract or otherwise, or any penalties or charges assessed by any  person or entity for the unauthorized receipt of gas.  Upon 30 Days written  notice and with the prior written consent of Contract Party, which consent  shall not be unreasonably withheld, this Guaranty may be replaced by (i) a  guaranty in identical form made by a guarantor of equal or better  creditworthiness, including credit ratings by nationally recognized credit  rating agencies, taking into consideration all relevant information  concerning corporate structure, all relevant financial information, both  current and projected, and all effects on the enforceability of the  replacement guaranty, or (ii) a letter of credit in favor of Contract Party  in the amount of the Maximum Limit (below defined), issued by a bank and in a  form, each of which shall be reasonably satisfactory to Contract Party,  taking into consideration all effects on the enforceability of the  replacement letter of credit; provided, this Guaranty shall continue to apply  to all Transactions in effect at the time this Guaranty is replaced until all  such Transactions are completed and the replacement guaranty or letter of  credit shall apply to only those Transactions formed after its execution and  delivery. 2.  MAXIMUM LIMIT.  The amount covered by this Guaranty for all Obligations  in respect of the aggregate of all Transactions under the Gas Contract that  ever shall be required to be paid by Guarantor shall not exceed  $_____________ (the ""Maximum Limit""); provided, this Guaranty shall cover and  Guarantor shall pay, in addition to the Maximum Limit, all reasonable  expenses, including, without limitation, attorneys' fees, court costs and  similar costs, of Contract Party in the event of judgment, settlement or  other enforcement against Guarantor.  The Maximum Limit shall not be affected  by the number or type of outstanding Transactions or the holding or  application of any collateral by Contract Party. 3.  DEFENSES.  Other than as expressly waived in this Guaranty, Guarantor  retains its own defenses and rights hereunder.  Guarantor WAIVES all rights,  setoffs, counterclaims and other defenses of Obligor relating to the  Obligations, including, without limitation, all rights, setoffs,  counterclaims and other defenses arising out of the bankruptcy, insolvency,  dissolution or liquidation of Obligor.       4.  DEFAULT.  If Obligor fails or refuses to pay timely any Obligations,  Contract Party may at its option exercise any or all of its rights, powers  and remedies afforded hereunder and under all documents, if any, securing  this Guaranty and may declare the unpaid amounts of all Obligations then  owing under the Gas Contract to be immediately due and payable, and thereupon  such amounts shall be immediately due and payable without presentation and  demand for payment, protest, notice of protest or dishonor, notice of  default, notice of intent to accelerate or notice of acceleration to  Guarantor or any other person or entity, all of which Guarantor hereby  WAIVES.   5.  REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES.  Guarantor represents and warrants that:   (i) it is a corporation duly organized and validly existing under the laws of  the State of its incorporation and has the power and authority to execute,  deliver and carry out the terms and provisions of this Guaranty, (ii) no  authorization, approval, consent or order of, or registration or filing with,  any court or other governmental body having jurisdiction over Guarantor is  required on the part of Guarantor for the execution and delivery of this  Guaranty and (iii) assuming due authorization, execution and delivery hereof  by Contract Party, this Guaranty constitutes a legal, valid and binding  agree-ment of Guarantor enforceable in accordance with its terms, except as  the enforceability thereof may be limited by the effect of any applicable  bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar laws affecting  creditors' rights generally and by general principles of equity. 6.  FINANCIAL INFORMATION.  At the written request of Contract Party,  Guarantor shall provide Contract Party with the financial information  described in Appendix ""1"" of the Gas Contract under Financial Information in  accordance therewith. 7.  NOTICE.  All notices and communications made pursuant to this Guaranty  shall be in writing and delivered personally or mailed by certified mail,  postage prepaid and return receipt requested, or sent by facsimile, as  follows: To Guarantor:  ________________ ________________ ________________ Facsimile:  _______ To Contract Party: ________________ ________________ ________________ Facsimile:  _______ Notice given by personal delivery or mail shall be effective upon actual  receipt.  Notice given by facsimile shall be effective upon actual receipt if  received during recipient's normal business hours or at the beginning of  recipient's next business day after receipt if not received during  recipient's normal business hours.  Any party may change its address to which  notice is to be given hereunder by providing notice of same in accordance  with this Section 7. 8.  LAW, WAIVERS, MISCELLANEOUS.  THIS GUARANTY SHALL IN ALL RESPECTS BE  GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF  TEXAS, WITHOUT REGARD TO PRINCIPLES OF CONFLICTS OF LAWS.  Guarantor WAIVES  all right to require marshaling of assets and liabilities, sale in inverse  order of alienation, notice of disposition of collateral and notice of  acceptance of this Guaranty.  The Transaction Procedures set forth in the Gas  Contract are acknowledged and agreed to by Guarantor and Guarantor agrees not  to contest the validity or enforceability of any Transaction entered into in  accordance with the Transaction Procedures under applicable law relating to  whether certain agreements are to be in writing or signed by the Party to be  thereby bound.  No term or provision of this Guaranty shall be amended,  modified, altered, waived, supple-mented or terminated except in a writing  signed by the parties hereto.  All capitalized terms used in this Guaranty  and not herein defined shall have the meanings attributed to them in the Gas  Contract.  This Guaranty shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of  and be enforceable by the respective successors and assigns of Guarantor and  Contract Party.  This Guaranty embodies the entire agreement and  under-standing between Guarantor and Contract Party and supersedes all prior  agreements and understandings relating to the subject matter hereof.  The  headings in this Guaranty are for purposes of reference only, and shall not  affect the meaning hereof.

"Regarding BC Utility,  I have discussed a GISB with Mr. Wong  and  we have  been unable to come to agreement  due to their choice of law restriction.   Because they are a utility they are by statute required to bind agreements  subject to  British Columbia.   Conversely as this would be an agreement  subject to state laws of Texas as well as the United States,  it will not  work to agree to British Columbia as jurisdiction for this contract.

"Marcia,  Thank you for your e-mail regarding SP's to the purposed GISB.  My responses  are as follows:  Section 1.   We will agree to your suggest  language.  Netting:  We suggest the following:    In the event that Buyer and Seller are each required to pay an amount in the  same Month hereunder, then such amounts with respect to each Party may be  aggregated and the Parties may discharge their obligations to pay through  netting,  in which case the party, if any, owing the greater aggregate amount  shall pay to the other party the difference between the amounts owed.  Adequate Assurance:   We will agree to 5 business days.  Term:  For firm delivery limit the use of the GISB to 30 days.  For  interruptible delivery there is no limit.  We  will agree to the above along with our other SP's as written.  Thanks for  your attention to the foregoing.  Please let me have your thoughts.

You are in danger of  being dropped from the membership directory for 2001 and from receiving  monthly luncheon notices.  Please send in your application for 2001 (see  attached form) and your $30 membership dues AS SOON AS POSSIBLE!  In the past, the WEN Board has sent you a copy of the monthly luncheon meeting notice and the bi-monthly newsletter by both e-mail and regular mail.  The WEN Board recently voted to discontinue sending notices by regular mail.  Beginning with this e-mail message, you will receive future meeting notices and the WEN newsletter by e-mail only.  Those members for whom we do not have an e-mail address will continue to receive their notices by regular mail.  Keeping the above in mind, please make sure that you print the attached meeting notice as an extra reminder to yourself to sign up for the luncheon since you won't be receiving the hard copy in the mail.  We hope that you approve of this method.  If you have friends in mind that you think would be interested in attending our next luncheon on February 14, please forward the attached luncheon notice to them.  Additionally, the Board also voted to begin publishing the WEN newsletter on a quarterly basis rather than bi-monthly.  We look forward to sending you your next newsletter in April.  For your information, we will be sending a survey to you in the near future to gather your input about suggestions for making WEN even better.  We value your opinion, so your responses to the survey will be greatly appreciated.  Don't forget that we will be having a Networking Happy Hour for all WEN members on Thursday, February 1, at Mesa Grill, 1971 W. Gray (713-520-8900) beginning at 5 p.m.  Hope to see you there!

In regard to the HPL agreement, we'd like to submit a few requested changes for your consideration, as follows:  1. Article 1.  Term.  We'd like to amend the initial term from one year to one month.  2. Section 3.2 Subsections(i)& (ii).  Seller's Failure to Schedule.  In the seventh line immediately after the word ""the"", delete the words ""Replacement Price Differential, plus (ii) liquidated damages equal to $0.15"" and replace with the words ""Gas Daily Price"".

Section 3.4 Subsections (i) & (ii).  Buyer's Failure To Deliver.  In the twelfth line delete the words ""Replacement Price Differential, plus (ii) liquidated damages equal to $0.15"" and replace with the words ""Gas Daily Price"".  In line thirteen immediately after the word ""Quantity"" delete the words ""to cover Seller's administrative and operational costs"" so these 2 subsections now read as follows: (i) an amount equal to the product of Buyer's Deficiency Quantity multiplied by the Gas Daily Price multiplied by Buyer's Deficiency Quantity.""  4.

Subsection (i) We'd like to limit the cure period during which an Affected Party is able to remedy a payment failure from five (5) Business Days to two (2) Business Days.  6. Section 8.2 Transfer.  In line five immediately after the word ""may"" delete the words ""without the"" and replace with the words ""with written"".  7. Appendix 1.  Definitions  ""Material Adverse Change"" definition.

I have based the EES Master Worksheet off of the ENA Master  Worksheet to remain consistent.  My understanding from talking with Veronica  and Russell is that this Master is not yet executed.  In negotiating the ENA Master, a $60MM Enron Corp. guarantee has been issued  benefiting TransCanada Energy USA, Inc.  In addition, TransCanada Pipelines  Ltd. has issued Enron and any of its subsidiaries a $60MM guarantee on behalf  of its sub, TransCanada Energy USA, Inc.    Putting in place an executed Master is definitely the only way to go as it  will allow us to net exposures between EES and the counterparty.

I also think that Elizabeth would  let you know if there was an issue on a particular deal.    This deal did NOT have a contract attached; I checked the audit tab to see  when Elizabeth approved it (the comment will read ""added user tag"").  I just  realized that the time was actually 5:30 when she approved it (gee, I can't  subtract 12:00 from military time).  I apologize.  I'm still showing the deal without a contract attached.  Maybe we have a  Sitara issue if you've already attached a deal.  I know we sometimes to have  to open another version of deal manager to see a contract, but I've done that  already and still don't see a contract.  Let me know if you see the same  thing.  I'm sorry if I came across the wrong way - the trouble with email vs.  face-to-face communication.  I just wanted to make sure you knew about our  policy and was afraid someone had overlooked telling you during training.  FYI - once a telephonic deal has a contract attached, it will stay in your  portfolio until the deal is VALIDATED.  Hope this clears everything up!

I have never left any outstanding deals out that I know of.  I have  two scenarios, either it did not show up on my portfolio immediately after  being released ( this has happened; where Liz has called and a particulary  deal has not shown up yet. In that case, I closed and re-opened the  portfolio) or either there were several fwd's still sitting out in that  portfolio that had not been removed even though a contract was attached.  It has always been my practice to keep checking the telephonic and make sure  they do have contracts attached since they sit out there so long.  Thanks, Sharon    Stacey Richardson@ECT 02/26/2001 07:59 AM To: Sharon Gonzales/NA/Enron@ENRON cc:    Subject: Sitara deal 637118  Hi Sharon,  I was checking the portfolios this morning and noticed a deal input on Friday  around 4:30 that didn't have a contract attached.  We usually don't get too  many deals coming in that late in the day, but please make sure to check your  portfolios throughout the day and before you leave.  Even though this deal  won't flow until 03/01/01, it is our policy to make sure that there are NO  outstanding deals without contracts attached when we leave the office every  day.  We will have exceptions, such as waiting on addition information or  requesting clarification on something, that are OK to leave unattached.  I  also know that Deal Capture does not always validate deals once we have  attached contracts, but our group has committed to clear all unattached  (non-problem) deals each day.  Please let me know if you have any questions or issues with that particular  deal.  I wasn't sure if you knew our group policy and I just wanted to make  sure we don't get nailed on it some day.  I know you've been pretty busy  handling other desks as well, and I appreciate that.  Thanks!

"Gary,  I have reviewed your GISB and Special Provisions my remarks are as follows:  Concerning the first page,  Section 2.5 Enron prefers to be the confirming  party; Section 3.2 we will agree to Spot Standard, and Section 13.5 Choice of  Law we will agree to  New York or Texas.  Special Provisions:  1. We would agree to this provision with minor changes in wording. 2. Agree to netting again with changes to language as follows:    In the event that Buyer and Seller are each required to pay an amount in  the same Month hereunder, then such amounts with respect to each Party may be  aggregated and the Parties may discharge their obligations to pay through  netting, in which case the Party, if any, owing the greater aggregate amount  may pay to the other Party the difference between the amounts owed.  We do not agree with purposed revisions to the remaining sections.     As previously stated,  ENA will  consider use of  the GISB for firm delivery  for 30 days or less.   This of course does not apply to interruptible  service.   If you intent is for greater that 30 days of firm delivery,  I  suggest we explore use of our Master Agreement in combination with a GISB or  alone.  The  Master  cannot be used for interruptible service  thus the need  for the GISB.  Please let me have your thoughts regarding these issues and how you would  like to proceed.

"Gary,  Thanks for your e-mail,  attached is a sample of our Master.  I notice we  currently have a Master in place with PPL Gas Utilities?  In response to your previous e-mail my comments  are as follows:  We cannot agree to both parties confirming.  ENA prefers to be the confirming  party.  Section 13.5  NY law is fine.  Our netting language is a stated below:  In the event that Buyer and Seller are each required to pay an amount in the  same Month hereunder, then such amounts with respect to each Party may be  aggregated and the Parties may discharge their obligations to pay through  netting, in which case the Party, if any, owing the greater aggregate amount  may pay to the other Party the difference between the amounts owed.  Your suggest to stipulate a 30 day limitation on usage for the contract is  not necessary as this condition is stated at the bottom of the first page in  the disclaimer.  With regards to limitation, we do not limit transactions to  one year.    Finally, with regards to the Master, our credit department will need to speak  to someone in your office for credit information.   Best regards, Debra Perlingiere Enron North America Corp.

On July 1, 1999 through October 31, 1999 Cabot began purchasing supply from Enron at Sumas.

I could find no such agreement in our files.  On July 28, 1999, Karen Lambert faxed this Agreement. I then realized that Enron was utilizing an Agreement which had not been assigned to Cabot in its merger with Washington Energy Resources Company in May 1994.  I tried on several occasions to explain the situation.  Finally on October 24, 2000 we received the above referenced Agreement originally effective October 1, 2000.  We then requested the effective date to be July 1, 1999 to encompass the original transaction along with the three (3) additional transactions.

Please have your  contract department implement the attached information into a GISB contract  and have it sent to me for review and execution.

Debra,  Ok, we're getting there.  Please see comments below.  1. Good, please prepare the draft Master Agreement and send it to my  attention.  We've been doing business with Enron since 1996, so the credit review shouldn't be a problem.  You can probably find everything you need on our home page (www.pplweb.com) or call Alan Babp at (610) 774-6129 {  aababp@pplweb.com}.  2. We're at a stalemate on the confirmations.  I have checked with out electrical side and their negotiated contract with Enron uses ""Seller Confirms"".  For Gas GISB contracts while we prefer ""PPL Confirms"", we  recognize that almost everyone wants to be the confirming party so we have been  accepting ""Both"".  But if you can't accept either of them, I suppose we can live with ""Seller Confirms"", since our electrical side has accepted it.  Those are our choices, in order of preference.  3. Good, I'm pleased you agree to the ""redundant"" language.  I know it will help my Trading Controls people.  Please advise...again, I think we're close.

When last we spoke, Enron wanted Duke to be reduced to $1M regarding Early Termination Damages due to current exposure rates.  Our credit department came back and said the Enron's exposure to Duke was such that they would then want to see an equal reduction in Enron's Early Termination Damges amount.  Basically, our credit department has asked that these amounts be reciprocal in nature as we have a situation where our exposure to one another is almost equal.  Please let me know what they say.

Since firm deals over a month should not be confirmed  under a GISB, this deal was split and 01/00 was moved to Sitara deal 133958  (cannot find Tagg number).  Deal 131153 was originally confirmed under a  Master Purchase Sale Firm but moved to the GISB following the correction of  the CP name on the deal ticket.  The deal was not reconfirmed under the GISB  to the best of my knowledge; I couldn't locate the deal in Livelink (the only  confirms under that deal number were for EPMI deals) and could only print the  confirm out of Tagg.   I could not locate the other deal numbers at all in Tagg and there are no  records in Livelink of the confirms either (only EPMI deals).  I'm guessing  the deals were confirmed out of DCAF, but I don't have access to that.   Someone in the Confirms group will have to print those for you.  One note:   The last deal, Sitara 107197, is a five-month firm deal that should NOT have  been attached to the GISB.  Since these are HPL deals, I'm not sure who confirms them, but you could  probably get some help from either Ellen Wallumrod, Ann Osire, or Richard  Deming.  On the contract side, Cheryl Dudley or Amelia Alland should be able  to help.  I'm afraid I've done all I can on this end.  I'm getting ready to fax the confirm for deal 131153 (before it was split)  since it's the only record I could pull up.  Sorry I couldn't find you everything!

I spoke to you last week regarding CPID 33395, Ila Powell, Agent and her request to have the agent name changed.  You had asked me to do some more research and find out what kind of contract we have with her and what she is ""agent"" for.  I spoke to Susan Ellidge in Contracts and she relayed that Enron has a Committed Reserves Agreement dated 1993 with Ila Powell, contract number 96002428.  The contract is between Enron and Ila Powell and she is listed on the contract as seller (of the commodity) and agent (for the wells involved).  The request we received, which I faxed a copy of to your office, states she wants all information on the wells sent to Dennis Powell, Agent (who is located at a different address/different state than the address we have for Ila Powell in GCP).  It also states she is no longer the agent.  I would like to call her advise her of a proper legal request for change of agent, but I have a feeling there will be more involved than a simple notarized request since there is a contract already in place.  Please advise what steps are needed to make this requested change of agent so that I may contact Ms Powell and relay the instructions in an intelligent manner (I am not legal savvy).

Elizabeth has moved the deal to Crestar Energy Marketing Corp. and the right contract is now attached.  Crestar will now be paid under Crestar Energy Marketing Corp.  as they have billed us.

BOTH CP versions are EOL counterparties and both appear on the 7/19/01 Credit Watch Report as ""No Trades"" with an E-rating of 10.  The question: Should all activity actually be under only the LLC version? Knowing most traders, they are going to pick which ever one they happen to click on first.   Bryce: Does anyone in your group know any reasons why Upstream Energy Services Company, LLC would want to segregate invoices & payments? One under ""Upstream Energy Services Company"" & the other under ""Upstream Energy Services Company, LLC""?  Donna: Is there a pathing issue that needs to keep transactions under both CP versions? One under ""Upstream Energy Services Company"" & the other under ""Upstream Energy Services Company, LLC""?  Debbie: Since they are linked, we are capturing exposure for transactions under either. How would credit prefer to see this?  Stacey/Debra: Are we currently negotiating a replacement GISB with Upstream? If so, any idea which name is or will be on the contract?  Stephanie: What is EOL's view?  The reason I bring this issue to your attention is based on the previous discussions surrounding the debate and concern on downstream system and deal capture under Headquarters, Divisions & Tradenames.

We cannot leave the contract silent on that issue.  How about making it 7 days instead of 5 days.  Our lawyers say that we must have a definitive number of days.

I deleted the reference    to    ""must pay within 5 business days"" added to paragraph 3.  If Enron does    make    a demand under this guaranty, there is no way we can make payment within    those 5 days (especially since we will need to rely on an outside party    to    provide data to us).  As you know, however, when we receive a demand    under    a guaranty, we move quickly to verify the request and make payments    where    appropriate.     I completed the information in paragraph 4(a).     I deleted the second copy of the reps and warranties of corporate    authority.     Finally, I reinserted ""excluding choice of law provisions . . . ""    language    to try to keep the case under Texas law, assuming a dispute ever arises.     All told, most of the changes look fine.     Thanks.

"Hi,   Got your message today, thanks.  I spent my gift certificate at Urban Retreat and now I am exhausted.  Too much beauty in one day!!  Tomorrow I have to go to MDA to my onocologist.  I am doing well except for the food issues.  I have lost 17 pounds because I still have alot of nausea.  I am sure it will pass soon and all the weight will come pouring back on!!!  Hope you are doing OK and not working yourself to death.  Take care and talk to you soon.   GG       America's surefire plan to defeat the terrorists.   Take all American women who are within five years of menopause - train  us  for a few weeks, outfit us with automatic weapons, grenades, gas masks,  moisturizer with SPF15, Prozac, hormones, chocolate, and canned tuna -  drop  us (parachuted, preferably) across the landscape of Afghanistan, and let  us  do what comes naturally.   Think about it.  Our anger quotient alone, even when doing standard  stuff  like grocery shopping and paying bills, is formidable enough to make  even  armed men in turbans tremble.   We've had our children, we would gladly suffer or die to protect them  and  their future.  We'd like to get away from our husbands, if they haven't  left already.  And for those of us who are single, the prospect of  finding  a good man with whom to share life is about as likely as being struck by   lightning.  We have nothing to lose.   We've survived the water diet, the protein diet, the carbohydrate diet,  and  the grapefruit diet in gyms and saunas across America and never lost a  pound.  We can easily survive months in the hostile terrain of  Afghanistan  with no food at all!   We've spent years tracking down our husbands or lovers in bars, hardware   stores, or sporting events...finding bin Laden in some cave will be no  problem.   Uniting all the warring tribes of Afghanistan in a new government?  Oh,  please ... we've planned the seating arrangements for in-laws and  extended  families at Thanksgiving dinners for years ... we understand tribal  warfare.   Between us, we've divorced enough husbands to know every trick there is  for  how they hide, launder, or cover up bank accounts and money sources.  We   know how to find that money and we know how to seize it ... with or  without  the government's help!   Let us go and fight.  The Taliban hates women.  Imagine their terror as  we  crawl like ants with hot-flashes over their godforsaken terrain.   I'm going to write my Congresswoman.  You should, too!

In regards to the sale of one of the Brewer wells, I had faxed you a copy of documentation filed with Enron back in 1997 for you to review and confirm that the documentation was sufficient to make the necessary change from W.E. or Mary Brewer Trust to Brewer Natural Gas LLC.  Mr. Brewer is awaiting notification from me that this issue is either resolved or more documentation is needed.  Please let me know if you have had a chance to look this documentation over or if I need to re-fax the information for your review.

I apologize for the delay.  Our comments are as follows:  Northern States Power Company Agreement  Disparity of Dollar Levels related to Credit Issues.  We request in Section 4.1 that the $50,000,000 dollar level be applicable to each of our companies.  We further request that the collateral trigger level in Section 4.7 be increased to $25,000,000 as to each of our companies.      2.4 Confirmations.  In the second line, please change ""may"" to ""shall"".  We need to have written confirmations of gas transactions in our files for regulatory purposes.  We also request on the Confirmation form Exhibit that the confirms issued to reflect telephonic transactions likewise be signed and returned, in the same manner as indicated on the form for Section 2.21 Transactions.      3.5 Netting and 4.4. Offset.  We cannot agree to the netting of payments in the normal course of business under these contracts.  Amounts due to and from a counterparty must be tracked separately for regulatory purposes, especially with respect to any sales proceeds that we might realize when NSP acts as the Seller to Enron in a Transaction.  Accordingly, we propose that the provision allowing monthly netting of amounts due between the parties be deleted from the contract and that the right of Offset be limited to be applicable only in connection with the occurrence of a Triggering Event and the calculation of any Termination Payment due under the Agreement.      4.1 Early Termination.  I am concerned that the date to be established for termination of Transactions is without definition.  I would prefer to see the language in subpart (i) modified to state that the Notifying Party may ""establish a date, which shall be not less than two (2) nor more than ten (10) Business Days following the date of such notice.""  4.2 Triggering Event.  In the 8th line down, I don't understand the inclusion of the phrase ""or deemed to be repeated"".  Unless I am missing something, it doesn't make sense with the rest of the sentence.  Please delete this phrase in the Agreement.       4.1 and 4.5 References to Affiliates.  In numerous places throughout the Agreements and, in particular, in Sections 4.1 and 4.5, reference is made to Affiliates.  For regulatory reasons, we cannot intermingle the account status of our affiliated companies.  Moreover, NSP is not authorized to contractually bind its Affiliates in the manner indicated.  Please delete all references to Affiliates of NSP in the respective Agreement.    Article 5. Force Majeure.  The language in this Article is not typical of most Force Majeure provisions, which allow a Party to claim Force Majeure for the duration of a Force Majeure event and place no limitation on the ability to claim Force Majeure within a given time period.  The language in your draft can be read to allow a Party to claim Force Majeure one time only, for a duration of up to 60 Days, after which time Force Majeure no longer applies to any of the obligations under the Agreement.  In other words, Force Majeure could not be claimed later for an unrelated occurrence involving a separate and independent Transaction.  This is not acceptable. We therefore request that you substitute your language with more standard Force Majeure provisions consistent with these comments.  Section 8.1. Notices.  Prior to the language in the parenthetical, please insert ""provided that receipt thereof has been confirmed electronically"".  Section 8.2.  Transfer.  We would prefer that this language be revised to the more traditional language requiring the consent (rather than approval) of the other Party, ""which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld"". Please modify this provision accordingly.    Section 8.3.  Limitation of Remedies.  We are in general agreement with this provision, however we cannot agree to a disclaimer of implied warranties of merchantability or fitness for the ordinary use.  The gas sold and purchased under the Agreement should be of merchantable quality and fit for the ordinary use to which it is intended.  Please modify this Section accordingly.    Definition of Confirm Deadline in ENFOLIO General Provisions.  The GISB Standard contract and all other contract forms that we use have a 2 day confirm deadline, rather than 24 hours as reflected in your definition.  We request that you revise this Agreement to be consistent with this industry standard.   Definition of Material Adverse Change.  This definition needs to be expanded beyond a review of the level of each company's credit rating.  Please replace your definition with the following:     ""Material Adverse Change"" with respect to a Party means (i) any downgrading of any unsecured, long-term senior debt of such Party  or any entity that has provided a guaranty or other form of credit support for the obligations of such Party (each such entity being a ""Credit Support Provider"" for such Party) such that such debt is rated below ""BBB-"" or its equivalent by Standard & Poors or below ""Baa3"", or its equivalent, by Moody's Investor Services, Inc.;  provided, that if a Party or its Credit Support Provider does not have  any unsecured, long-term, senior debt that is rate by either  Standard & Poors or Moody's Investor Services, Inc., then a  Material Adverse Change shall mean the occurrence of one or more  events which, in the reasonable judgment of the exposed Party  constitutes a material adverse effect on the creditworthiness,  financial responsibility, or ability of such Party or its Credit Support  Provider, as applicable, to perform its obligations in connection  herewith.     Definition of Replacement Price Differential.  Although we are in general agreement with your definition of Replacement Price Differential, it seems preferable that where the Minimum Monthly Quantity is applicable, cost of cover should be the difference between the contract price and a 30 or 31 day average of Spot Prices for the Month in which the deficiency occurred. Please modify your definition accordingly.    Please make changes to the Northern States Power Company Agreement consistent with our comments as set forth above.  Should you have questions or wish to discuss any of our requested changes, you may contact me via return e-mail or at the phone number listed below.       Thank you for your consideration.  I look forward to working with you to finalize this Agreement.

We request in Section 4.1 that the $50,000,000 dollar level be applicable to each of our companies.  We further request that the collateral trigger level in Section 4.7 be increased to $25,000,000 as to each of our companies.      2.4 Confirmations.  In the second line, please change ""may"" to ""shall"".  We need to have written confirmations of gas transactions in our files for regulatory purposes.  We also request on the Confirmation form Exhibit that the confirms issued to reflect telephonic transactions likewise be signed and returned, in the same manner as indicated on the form for Section 2.21 Transactions.      3.5 Netting and 4.4. Offset.  We cannot agree to the netting of payments in the normal course of business under these contracts.  Amounts due to and from a counterparty must be tracked separately for regulatory purposes, especially with respect to any sales proceeds that we might realize when NSP acts as the Seller to Enron in a Transaction.  Accordingly, we propose that the provision allowing monthly netting of amounts due between the parties be deleted from the contract and that the right of Offset be limited to be applicable only in connection with the occurrence of a Triggering Event and the calculation of any Termination Payment due under the Agreement.      4.1 Early Termination.  I am concerned that the date to be established for termination of Transactions is without definition.  I would prefer to see the language in subpart (i) modified to state that the Notifying Party may ""establish a date, which shall be not less than two (2) nor more than ten (10) Business Days following the date of such notice.""  4.2 Triggering Event.  In the 8th line down, I don't understand the inclusion of the phrase ""or deemed to be repeated"".  Unless I am missing something, it doesn't make sense with the rest of the sentence.  Please delete this phrase in the Agreement.       4.1 and 4.5 References to Affiliates.  In numerous places throughout the Agreements and, in particular, in Sections 4.1 and 4.5, reference is made to Affiliates.  For regulatory reasons, we cannot intermingle the account status of our affiliated companies.  Moreover, NSP is not authorized to contractually bind its Affiliates in the manner indicated.  Please delete all references to Affiliates of NSP in the respective Agreement.    Article 5. Force Majeure.  The language in this Article is not typical of most Force Majeure provisions, which allow a Party to claim Force Majeure for the duration of a Force Majeure event and place no limitation on the ability to claim Force Majeure within a given time period.  The language in your draft can be read to allow a Party to claim Force Majeure one time only, for a duration of up to 60 Days, after which time Force Majeure no longer applies to any of the obligations under the Agreement.  In other words, Force Majeure could not be claimed later for an unrelated occurrence involving a separate and independent Transaction.  This is not acceptable. We therefore request that you substitute your language with more standard Force Majeure provisions consistent with these comments.  Section 8.1. Notices.  Prior to the language in the parenthetical, please insert ""provided that receipt thereof has been confirmed electronically"".  Section 8.2.  Transfer.  We would prefer that this language be revised to the more traditional language requiring the consent (rather than approval) of the other Party, ""which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld"". Please modify this provision accordingly.    Section 8.3.  Limitation of Remedies.  We are in general agreement with this provision, however we cannot agree to a disclaimer of implied warranties of merchantability or fitness for the ordinary use.  The gas sold and purchased under the Agreement should be of merchantable quality and fit for the ordinary use to which it is intended.  Please modify this Section accordingly.    Definition of Confirm Deadline in ENFOLIO General Provisions.  The GISB Standard contract and all other contract forms that we use have a 2 day confirm deadline, rather than 24 hours as reflected in your definition.  We request that you revise this Agreement to be consistent with this industry standard.   Definition of Material Adverse Change.  This definition needs to be expanded beyond a review of the level of each company's credit rating.  Please replace your definition with the following:     ""Material Adverse Change"" with respect to a Party means (i) any downgrading of any unsecured, long-term senior debt of such Party  or any entity that has provided a guaranty or other form of credit support for the obligations of such Party (each such entity being a ""Credit Support Provider"" for such Party) such that such debt is rated below ""BBB-"" or its equivalent by Standard & Poors or below ""Baa3"", or its equivalent, by Moody's Investor Services, Inc.;  provided, that if a Party or its Credit Support Provider does not have  any unsecured, long-term, senior debt that is rate by either  Standard & Poors or Moody's Investor Services, Inc., then a  Material Adverse Change shall mean the occurrence of one or more  events which, in the reasonable judgment of the exposed Party  constitutes a material adverse effect on the creditworthiness,  financial responsibility, or ability of such Party or its Credit Support  Provider, as applicable, to perform its obligations in connection  herewith.     Definition of Replacement Price Differential.  Although we are in general agreement with your definition of Replacement Price Differential, it seems preferable that where the Minimum Monthly Quantity is applicable, cost of cover should be the difference between the contract price and a 30 or 31 day average of Spot Prices for the Month in which the deficiency occurred. Please modify your definition accordingly.    Please make changes to the Northern States Power Company Agreement consistent with our comments as set forth above.  Should you have questions or wish to discuss any of our requested changes, you may contact me via return e-mail or at the phone number listed below.       Thank you for your consideration.  I look forward to working with you to finalize this Agreement.

"We already have an Enfolio Master Firm Purchase/Sale Agreement in place with ENA, which continues on a month-to-month basis since the original one-year term expired on 11/1/01.  I assume that the Spot agreement would enable us to buy/sell interruptible gas, but it also seems to cover firm purchases.  Would the Spot agreement take the place of the Firm agreement?  If not, would having both agreements in place create any overlaps or conflicts?  How would we know which agreement applied to a particular transaction?  (For example, I don't see a netting provision in the Spot agreement, which is something that we would insist upon.)  Please let me know how the agreements would relate to one another.

I guess you didn't get my email about getting a table.  Well, I now have a phone, and hopefully you'll have one soon.  Let's definitely shoot for Thursday.  I may take Friday off if I get everything done this week.  Sorry too!  What do you think about Stacy's news????   -----Original Message----- From:  Perlingiere, Debra   Sent: Monday, March 25, 2002 1:18 PM To: Richardson, Stacey Subject: RE: where are you???
