Reg. 34042, 6/26/01).  Those amendments would implement CFMA Section 203, which allows futures commission merchants and introducing brokers that are registered with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to register with the SEC as broker-dealers for the limited purpose of effecting transactions in certain security futures products. SEC registration in such cases would be accomplished by filing notice with the SEC.  In addition, the SEC proposed a conditional exemption from registration under 1934 Securities Exchange Act Section 15(a). The proposed exemption would ""provide guidance on the extent to which a broker-dealer registered by notice may trade security futures products,"" the SEC said. It would allow a broker-dealer registered by notice to trade any security futures products as long as the broker-dealer did not become a member of a registered national securities exchange or national securities association.  Finally, the commission proposed changes to Regulation S-P, which was adopted under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act. ""These amendments would revise certain provisions of Regulation S-P in light of section 124 of the CFMA, which makes the privacy provisions of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act applicable to activity regulated by the CFTC."" These amendments would permit futures commission merchants and introducing brokers registered by notice with the SEC as broker-dealers to comply with Regulation S-P by adhering to the CFTC's financial privacy rules, the SEC said.  Comments are due by July 26, 2001, and should refer to File No. S7-13-01. ",chris.long@enron.com,legal <.taylor@enron.com>,RE: SEC/CFMA,2001-07-02 14:00:11-07:00,sent

I have progressively  moved into project management as a project engineer. I have enhanced these  management skills by learning new software while managing and tracking cost and  schedule of projects. I have managed small construction projects from inception  through completion on schedule and under cost. I am a past member of the Project  Management Institute (PMI) and have taken the Study Seminars so that I can take  the test to earn the Certificate PMP, Project Manager Professional. I plan to  sit for the PMP test next spring. I have excellent communication skills both up  and down the organization chart whether good or requiring immediate attention.

"Thanks Chris.  I've taken a quick look at these and my reaction is (1) as to the definitions of specified transaction, we will probably not want to sign on to the expansive provision as an end-user, but it may make sense from the dealers' perspective and (2) we have needed exactly what is being proposed regarding the calculation of termination payments for some time and I view this as a major step forward.

Attached please find the end user letters objecting to some of the proposed changes to the ISDA Master Agreement.  As I mentioned, MFA, the UK Association of Corporate Treasurers, the Committee for the Investment of Employee Benefit Assets (CIEBA) and the End Users of Derivatives Council (the old EUDA) have all sent letters to ISDA saying that they have problems with some of the proposed changes.  We met with ISDA once, back in March.  CIEBA and EUDC have both asked for meetings with ISDA.  Not sure if there has been any meetings or whether they are scheduled.    Obviously we believe that the documents need to be fair to end users.  We believe it is in ISDA's best interests to not go forward with changes which end users object to.

"Mark, I like this one.  Although the essential functions discusses the major requirements, I don't believe that any one person can meet all points.  I will need to update and learn more about item #8.  Otherwise I am a 90% fit for this one.

"Mark, I know four different planning and scheduling software packages, but not Primavera Project Planner.  PG used MS Projects after using three others. Neither BGP nor EGC were interested in a $3000 investment for one license. I am willing to learn Primavera. The understanding of activitity sequencing and relationships - not a problem.  I feel that this one is about 60%.  The only other thing missing is that on most of my projects we did not do resource allocation using the scheduling porgram.  Most of the projects were short.  The schedule was for the client to know about how much down time would be required and if weekend work would be required.

"Mark, The description on this one, I feel good about.  I do not have 15 years of field experience but do have over 10 years of project management experience. However, item 6. INTERFACE WITH GOVERNMENT AGENCIES WHICH HAVE REGULATORY AUTHORITY OVER THE PROJECT AND OBTAIN THE NECESSARY PERMITS. I have worked with the State of Ohio for permits and licensing.

"Kelly:  Thanks for getting back to me with your analysis.  Here's what I've done:  Not sure what the situation is with the Lead Expediter (95%) position -- the phone line of the manager for that one doesn't seem to be working and an e-mail to him was returned as undeliverable -- even though his name was in the company e-mail address book.  But he's in the same department as one of the jobs below (Sr. Purchasing Agent I think), and this position is a more junior slot, so you probably want to be considered for the more senior position first anyway.  The Senior Project Manager (80-90%) and Senior Purchasing Agent (80%) slots are still open.  I talked briefly to the managers listed on the postings and have forwarded your resume to them for consideration.  I have no feel for the timing on the Proj. Mgr. position and in fact the manager was a bit brusque, but the guy on the Purch. Agent job said the timing was great since he's taking a stack of resumes home with him this weekend to review.  I've left voice-mail messages concerning the Construction Engineer (90%) and Process/Mechanical Engineer II (80%) positions and will forward your resume if they are still looking.   On the others, it might make sense to go ahead and go through the application process on the website.  Particularly for the one that says not to contact them directly -- there's no pointing in making them mad before they even see your resume!  I'll keep you posted on the others.  If there are no answers to my voicemails by the middle to end of next week, you might want to submit for those on the website, too.  At least then you know your resume is in the hopper.

We discussed the process of doing away with the confirmations for EnronOnline transactions in our last group meeting.  It looks like the most equitable way to staff these is to rotate them among the lawyers like we rotate masters among the paralegals.  No one should end up with more than two or three of them that way.  Janet Moore is taking a first cut using the form and adding the power-specific provisions and then sending them on to the gas group.  The gas group will then forward them to me for us to include any derivatives-specific provisions.,"mary.cook@enron.com, brent.hendry@enron.com, c..koehler@enron.com,   pinto.leite@enron.com, frank.sayre@enron.com,   sara.shackleton@enron.com",legal <.taylor@enron.com>,"""No More Confirms"" Agreements",2001-07-09 17:10:06-07:00,sent

This is par= ticularly true as our trading business is expanding to include numerous com= modity lines, including gas, power, coal, steel, pulp and paper, each of wh= ich may be traded under different masters with a single counterparty.  This=  complexity is further increased as a result of EWS using multiple affiliat= ed entities to trade the various commodities.  Absent express contractual s= etoff rights, EWS may be unable to setoff exposures under different master = contracts.  =09A team of EWS lawyers has been working to assemble setoff language that = will substantially enhance EWS's credit position with counterparties with w= hom we trade multiple commodities.  This setoff language, which is set fort= h below, must be in all EWS trading form contracts.  Similarly, when negoti= ating on third party paper, we should request that this additional setoff l= anguage be added.   MANDATORY SETOFF LANGUAGE FOR=20 EWS TRADING CONTRACTS  =09(A) Upon the designation or deemed designation of an Early Termination D= ate, the Non-Defaulting Party (""X"") may, at its option and in its discretio= n, setoff, against any amounts Owed to the Defaulting Party (""Y"") by X or a= ny Affiliate of X under this Agreement or under any other agreement(s), ins= trument(s) or undertaking(s), any amounts Owed by Y to X or any of X's Affi= liates under this Agreement or under any other agreement(s), instrument(s) = or undertaking(s).  The obligations of Y and X under this Agreement in resp= ect of such amounts shall be deemed satisfied and discharged to the extent = of any such setoff exercised by X and/or X's Affiliates.  X will give Y not= ice of any setoff effected under this section as soon as practicable after = the setoff is effected provided that failure to give such notice shall not = affect the validity of the setoff.  For purposes of this Section __, ""Owed""=  shall mean any amounts owed or otherwise accrued and payable (regardless o= f whether such amounts have been or could be invoiced) as of the Early Term= ination Date.  =09  =09Amounts subject to the setoff permitted in this Section __ may be conver= ted by X into any currency in which any obligation Owed is denominated at t= he rate of exchange at which X, acting in a reasonable manner and in good f= aith, would be able to purchase the relevant amount of the currency being c= onverted. If an obligation is unascertained, X may in good faith estimate t= hat obligation and setoff in respect of the estimate, subject to the releva= nt party accounting to the other when the obligation is ascertained.  Nothi= ng in this Section __shall be effective to create a charge or other securit= y interest except as may be provided under applicable law.   This setoff pr= ovision shall be without prejudice and in addition to any right of setoff, = netting, off-set, combination of accounts, counterclaim, lien or other righ= t to which any party is at any time otherwise entitled (whether by operatio= n of law, contract or otherwise).  Each of the parties represent and acknow= ledge that the rights set forth in this Section __ are an integral part of = the agreement between the parties and that without such rights the parties = would not be willing to enter into Transactions.  The parties further ackno= wledge that each is executing this Agreement on behalf of itself as princip= al and, with respect to this Section ___, as agent on behalf of its Affilia= tes, which Affiliates shall receive the benefits of this Section __ and oth= erwise be bound as if such Affiliates had directly signed this Agreement as=  it relates to Section ___.  =09(B) Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained in this Agre= ement, the Non-Defaulting Party shall not be required to pay to the Default= ing Party any amount under Section __ until the Non-Defaulting Party receiv= es confirmation satisfactory to it in its reasonable discretion (which may = include an opinion of its counsel) that all other obligations of any kind w= hatsoever of the Defaulting Party to make any payments to the Non-Defaultin= g Party or any of its Affiliates under this Agreement or under any other ag= reement(s), instrument(s) or undertaking(s), which are Owed as of the Early=  Termination Date have been fully and finally satisfied.  =09This new setoff language will provide EWS the right to setoff amounts du= e and owing as of the Early Termination Date (but does not include future p= ayments) between the counterparty and EWS and its affiliates (triangular se= toff) after the designation of an Early Termination Date.  This language ha= s been reviewed by U.S. bankruptcy counsel, and is appropriate under U.S. l= aws for commodity transactions with U.S.-based counterparties.  Each group = will need to review this language with their local counsel in each jurisdic= tion in which EWS trades in order to ensure enforceability.   In addition, = prior to introducing this language into your forms, changes will be require= d to terminology and/or to include terminations resulting from events other=  than Events of Default (e.g. ""Affected Party"" under ISDA).  Finally, when = incorporating this setoff language into the EWS trading forms, please be aw= are that this language is not intended to override the payment netting term= s (monthly netting of receivables) or the close-out netting procedures (app= licable upon the designation of an Event of Default), both of which should = remain in the trading forms.  Rather, this language is only intended to add=  setoff rights to all EWS trading forms.

I believe I'm listed as an officer on various Enron companies, including EPMI, for which I had to be fingerprinted for some type of California regulatory requirements.  Given the level of legal conflict etc. in California, and simply because it seems reasonable that I should understand if I have any exposure by being named an officer, I'd like to discuss it with one of our lawyers.  I've heard of D&O insurance, but really don't know what exactly that's for, whether I'm covered, and why I might even need it.

Will call you tomorrow am.   -----Original Message----- From:  Dyk, Russell   Sent: Tuesday, July 24, 2001 6:33 PM To: Leach, Doug Cc: Gagliardi, Larry; Shankman, Jeffrey A.; Abramo, Caroline; Zivic, Robyn; Plauche, Stephen Subject: RE: hedge funds  Doug and Larry  - I would say we're at least 6 weeks away from getting the first fund (Tudor) set up to transact gas, crude, products, etc. on EOL.   The primary reason for this is the way Tudor - and most of these funds - are set up. Normally the funds have at least two separate entities, one onshore and one offshore, so that they can attract both US and overseas investors.   We have separate ISDAs w/ each fund, yet in practice the fund manager will trade, say, 100 lots which is then split in some way between the two funds. While this works in practice right now, with the funds calling in and us executing orders, it would not work at present on EOL unless they traded as separate entities. Because one manager/trader usually trades on behalf of both entities, he would have to be clicking on two separate EOL screens to trade.   When I spoke w/ Larry 2 weeks ago, he asked whether the funds could trade on EOL through only one of the two entities. I brought this up w/ them and the reply was that it's not possible. The reason is that the funds are set up legally according to certain guidelines, one of which is that trades are allocated among the various funds according to capital in each fund. To put all of one trade in one fund would violate those guidelines, as the manager would be favoring one class of investors - say, foreign ones if it were only the offshore fund that traded on EOL - over another by putting all of one trade in one fund. If the trade was a winner, the foreign investors would benefit more than domestic ones. If it's a loser, it would be the other way around.    The way we're proceeding to work around this is to draft an a legal agreement that basically gives one entity (a ""superfund"") the ability to trade on EOL on behalf of all the funds with which we have ISDAs. We have spoken to the funds about this, as well as to Dan Diamond and Savita Puthigai from EOL, and all have agreed that this is the best way forward.   There are two funds that we deal w/ which have only one entity, which would make transacting on EOL much easier.   One of those - Harvard - already has transaction rights on EOL. Harvard, however, is not going to be a flow customer, which is why I noted above that Tudor is really the first fund that will transact regularly on EOL. Harvard's focus is longer term and typically more option-oriented. The one thing they might trade on a more frequent basis - as I mentioned to Larry - is the WTI/Brent spread. Other funds have expressed interest in seeing this product online as well.  The second fund we are still negotiating an ISDA with, but that should be signed within the next 2 weeks.   As you can see, the funds are not all set up the same way. Moreover, many have different focuses - i.e. short-term, longer-term, fundamentally driven, technically-driven, etc. Some are also restricted by their charter from trading prompt-month instruments. Our goal is to get all of them set up on EnronOnline; but not all of them will be flow customers.   All the funds currently have guest IDs on EOL. We worked an arrangement w/ Dave Forster and Mike Bridges of EOL under which the funds' guest accounts are good for 2-6 months. So the funds are seeing EOL prices, and we very often transact on those prices - at this point more on the gas side than crude. However, recent trades we have initiated on the crude/products side - for example, a Cal02 fuel oil crack - have been done b/c a fund has seen the price on EOL. Moreover, trades we pitch are often referenced to EOL prices, so that the funds can monitor them for their desired levels.   Chris Glaas has visited many of the funds to pitch his EOL DFL product, which would allow them to more easily and transparently play in the Dated Brent market. So has Andy James, from the shipping group, who was pitching both dry bulk cargo and wet tanker route markets on EOL. When we last spoke, Larry introduced me to the TAS gasoline product. We're definitely interested in the new products that are out there, and are happy to talk to the funds about specific ones.   As far as internal problems, the only one we have is the lack of adequate numbers of legal staff to draft and negotiate ISDAs and these EOL omnibus agreements w/ the funds. ENA/EGM has assigned one lawyer to us - Frank Sayre - and he is also saddled w/ other responsibilities so that his time is very constrained.   Just to summarize, as far as status on EOL, all the funds except Harvard have guest IDs for EOL. We have signed ISDAs w/ five and are negotiating ISDAs w/ seven more. In addition, we are in discussion w/ two other funds. Three of the funds - one with which we're negotiating an ISDA and the two with which we're in discussion - are program (""black box"") funds. Our specific pitch to them was EOL, as it has more transparent pricing and often tighter spreads than they see on the floor. Of all the funds, these we expect would provide the most flow business to EOL.   Sorry for the long explanation to a short request - if you have more questions I'd be happy to discuss them over the phone. I'm at 212 702 3914.

We believe this is responsive to the concerns that were raised, and hope that you agree.  I am circulating this to those at yesterday's meeting for whom I have e-mail addresses;  I trust you will circulate to others in the PWG.  Thanks Mike.   Sec. 562 - Timing of damage measurement in connection with [protected contracts]  If the trustee rejects a [protected contract or agreement] or if [a protected counterparty] liquidates, terminates, or accelerates such contract or agreement, damages shall be measured as of the earlier of --  (1) the date of such rejection; or  (2) the date or dates of such liquidation, termination, or acceleration unless:       (A)  there are not any commercially reasonable determinants of value as of such date or dates, in which case such forward contract merchant, stockbroker, financial institution, securities clearing agency, repo participant, financial participant, master netting agreement participant, or swap participant shall measure damages as of the earliest subsequent date or dates on which there are commercially reasonable determinants of value; or       (B) there are no determinants of value as of such date or dates, in which case such forward contract merchant, stockbroker, financial institution, securities clearing agency, repo participant, financial participant, master netting agreement participant, or swap participant shall measure damages as of the earliest date or dates after, or the latest date or dates before, such date or dates on which there are commercially reasonable determinants of value.  For the purposes of subsection (2), if damages are not measured as of the date or dates of liquidation, termination or acceleration and the trustee challenges the timing of the measurement of damages by a forward contract merchant, stockbroker, financial institution, securities clearing agency, repo participant, financial participant, master netting agreement participant, or swap participant,  such forward contract merchant, stockbroker, financial institution, securities clearing agency, repo participant, financial participant, master netting agreement participant, or swap participant has the burden of proving that there were no commercially reasonable determinants of value or no determinants of value as of such date or dates.   Legislative History:    Section 910 adds a new section 562 to the Bankruptcy Code providing that damages under any swap agreement, securities contract, forward contract, commodity contract, repurchase agreement or master netting agreement will be calculated as of the earlier of (i) the date of rejection of such agreement by a trustee or (ii) the date or dates of liquidation, termination or acceleration of such contract or agreement.  Section 562 provides an exception to the rule in (ii) if there are no commercially reasonable determinants of value as of such date or dates,  in which case damages are to be measured as of the earliest subsequent date or dates after such date or dates on which there are commercially reasonable determinants of value, or if there are no determinants of value as of such date or dates, in which case damages are to be measured as of the earliest subsequent date or dates after such date or dates or the latest date or dates before such date or dates on which there are commercially reasonable determinants of value.  Although it is expected that in most circumstances damages would be measured as of the date or dates of liquidation, termination or acceleration, in certain unusual circumstances, such as dysfunctional markets or liquidation of very large portfolios, there may be no commercially reasonable determinants of value, and in other unusual circumstances, such as war conditions, there may be no determinants of value whatsoever.  Measuring damages as of a date or dates before the date of liquidation, termination or acceleration will occur in very unusual circumstances.  An example was the need to use the most recent available information for the Kuwaiti Dinar after the virtual disappearance of the currency after the invasion of Kuwait in 1990.  The non-bankrupt party is not given unlimited discretion to determine the date as of which damages are to be measured.  Instead, its actions are circumscribed unless there are no ""commercially reasonable"" determinants of value (or no determinants of value whatsoever) for it to measure damages on the date or dates of liquidation, termination or acceleration.  The references to ""commercially reasonable"" are intended to reflect existing state law standards relating to a creditor's actions in determining damages.  New section 562 provides that if damages are not measured as of the date or dates or liquidation, termination or acceleration and the trustee challenges the timing of the measurement of damages by a forward contract merchant, stockbroker, financial institution, securities clearing agency, repo participant, financial participant, master netting agreement participant, or swap participant, such forward contract merchant, stockbroker, financial institution, securities clearing agency, repo participant, financial participant, master netting agreement participant, or swap participant has the burden of proving the absence of any commercially reasonable determinants of value or any determinants of value, as the case may be.  New section 562 is not intended to have any impact on the determination under the Bankruptcy Code of the timing of damages for contracts and agreements other than those specified in section 562.  Also, section 562 does not apply to proceedings under the FDIA, and it is not intended that Section 562 have any impact on the interpretation of the provisions of the FDIA relating to timing of damages in respect of QFCs or other contracts.

"We do know which companies use the system.  I don't know if that information is stored in a searchable format but there is definitely a customer database that has profiles stored for each customer and determines what they have access to on the system.

Basically, FERC did not believe that buying thru EnronOnline was a guarantee that consumers in Oregon would not be harmed.    FERC found that There is, for      example, no assurance that the posted prices on EnronOnline                                           represent prevailing market prices.           Applicants contend that, since PGE can transact with EPMI      via EnronOnline only at the posted price, there can be no      affiliate abuse.  We are not certain, however, that the posted      price necessarily represents the market price.  While, on the      surface, Enron Online may bear some resemblance to an index or an      auction, the posted prices for any product may not be the result      of a competitive market of multiple buyers and sellers; in fact,      for sales the posted prices represent what EPMI is willing to      sell at, and for purchases the posted prices represent what EPMI      is willing to buy at.  FERC left open the idea that PGE could re-file to fix the affiliate abuse.  As soon as we hear anything else, I'll let you know.

Massey, Linda Breathitt,                           Pat Wood, III and Nora Mead Brownell.        Portland General Electric Company         Docket No. ER01-2097-000       Enron Power Marketing, Inc.                  Docket No. ER01-2103-000   ORDER REJECTING TARIFF AMENDMENTS WITHOUT           PREJUDICE                             (Issued July 20, 2001)            In this order we reject, without prejudice, proposed      amendments of Enron Power Marketing, Inc. (EPMI) and Portland      General Electric (PGE) to their respective market-based rate      tariffs that would allow them to make inter-affiliate sales using      the EnronOnline trading platform.       I.   Background            On May 22, 2001, in separate filings, affiliates PGE in      Docket No. ER01-2097-000 and EPMI in Docket No. ER01-2103-000      (collectively Applicants) filed to amend their respective market-      based rate schedules to allow for inter-affiliate sales through      the EnronOnline trading platform, and to prohibit communication      among affiliates regarding the contents of prices posted on      EnronOnline or the times that PGE will be making trades on                  1      EnronOnline.   This amendment does not supplant the existing      provisions of PGE's and EPMI's currently effective tariffs which      allow for inter-affiliate sales subject to conditions that the      Commission generally imposes on inter-affiliate sales where there      are captive customers, e.g., allowing a public utility to sell to      its affiliated power marketer only at a rate that is no lower      than the rate it charges non-affiliates, requiring simultaneous      offers to non-affiliates, or requiring use of a relevant,      established index.  Rather, PGE and EPMI propose to amend their      respective tariffs to add a provision by which they will make                 1                 The EnronOnline system is administered by Enron Networks,           an Enron Corp. subsidiary.  EnronOnline is a free, Internet-           based, transaction system which allows EPMI's customers to view           real time prices from EPMI's traders and transact instantly           online.  EnronOnline is not an EPMI application, but rather           EnronOnline is a trading platform used as a tool by EPMI in           buying from and selling power to third parties.                  Docket Nos. ER01-2097-000 -2-           and ER01-2103-000       inter-affiliate sales via EnronOnline, with restrictions      different than those in place but that, they state, will still      prevent affiliate abuse.  Applicants state that the Commission's      requirements have become outdated due to recent developments in      electronic commerce and, in particular, the Commission's      requirement that ""PGE post on its website notice of a potential      purchase or sale with EPMI prior to PGE entering into the      transaction with EPMI prohibits PGE from using EnronOnline, since      EnronOnline offers only instantaneous transactions that do not      provide for a waiting period before consummating the                   2      transaction.""   According to Applicants, this deprives PGE of the      ability to buy or sell power ""from perhaps the largest marketer                                                                 3      in its region, to the detriment of PGE and its ratepayers.""       II.  Notice of Filing and Interventions/Protests            Notices of the filings were published in the Federal      Register, 66 Fed. Reg. 29,939 (2001) (Docket No. ER01-2097-000),      and 66 Fed. Reg. 30,180 (2001) (Docket No. ER01-2103-000), with      motions to intervene and protests for both due on or before      June 12, 2001.  None was filed.       III. Discussion            The Commission allows power marketers and their public      utility affiliates to sell to one another at market-based rates      when it can be assured that there is no possibility of affiliate      abuse.  As the Commission has explained, affiliate abuse can      occur when a traditional public utility with captive customers      sells power at below-market prices to, or purchases power at      above-market prices from, an affiliate without captive customers      (such as a power marketer affiliate).  One way in which the      Commission has sought to prevent this type of cross-subsidization      by captive customers is to require the pricing of inter-affiliate                                                              4      sales at an established, relevant market price or index.      Another way, when there is no assurance that the affiliates are      transacting at the prevailing market price, is to adopt various      conditions previously established by the Commission to prevent                      5      affiliate abuse.                 2                 EPMI Application at 3; PGE Application at 4.                3                 EPMI Application at 3; PGE Application at 4.                4                 See, e.g., DPL Energy, Inc. 90 FERC   61,200 (2000);           accord, First Energy Trading Services, Inc., 88 FERC   61,067 at           61,156 (1999).                5                 E.g., GPU Advanced Resources, Inc., 81 FERC   61,335 at                                                         (continued...)                  Docket Nos. ER01-2097-000 -3-           and ER01-2103-000             Here, Applicants request that the Commission permit them to      use EnronOnline to make inter-affiliate sales, subject to the      following restrictions that they contend provide sufficient      protection against affiliate abuse.  PGE, when buying from EPMI      using EnronOnline, will be required to ""take the transaction      price as posted that is generally applicable at a particular                                                               6      location without attempting to negotiate any adjustment.""   In                                                                   7      addition, PGE will be prohibited from submitting Limit Orders  or      engaging in any other type of transaction in which the identity      of the counter-party is revealed to EPMI prior to the transaction      being finalized.  Applicants also propose to amend their      respective codes of conduct to preclude any communication      regarding prices posted on EnronOnline.            Applicants contend such restrictions ensure no affiliate      abuse occurs since PGE will only be able to transact with EPMI at            5            (...continued)           62,539 (1997) (GPU); Detroit Edison Company, 80 FERC   61,348 at           62,197-98 (1997) (Detroit Edison).  In GPU, the Commission           allowed sales from a power marketer to its affiliated traditional           public utility at a rate that was no higher than the lowest rate           the public utility paid non-affiliates under certain standard           supplier agreements.  Accord, First Energy Trading & Power           Marketing, Inc., 84 FERC   61,214 at 62,037-38, reh'g denied, 85           FERC   61,311 (1998).  Detroit Edison provided that a traditional           public utility may sell power to its affiliated power marketer           only at a rate that is no lower than the rate it charges non-           affiliates; that the utility simultaneously offer through its           electronic bulletin board to sell to non-affiliates at the same           rate offered to its affiliate; and that all prices charged to the           affiliate be simultaneously posted on its electronic bulletin           board.  Accord, Jersey Central Power & Light Co., 82 FERC           61,023 at 61,071 (1998); Commonwealth Edison Co., 85 FERC           61,288 at 62,176-77 (1998).                6                 EPMI Application at 4; PGE Application at 5.                7                 In the case of a Limit Order on EnronOnline, EPMI would           know the identity of the customer requesting a price higher or           lower than that currently available.  Applications at 3.  While           Applicants do not define ""Limit Order,"" the common understanding           is that, unlike a market order, which instructs a broker to           transact immediately at whatever price is currently available in           the marketplace, a limit order instructs a broker to fill the           order only if certain conditions are met.  Generally, a limit           order may be either a day order, in which case it expires when           the market closes if unfilled, or good-until-canceled, in which           case the limit order lasts until executed or canceled.                  Docket Nos. ER01-2097-000 -4-           and ER01-2103-000       the posted price (a price that is offered to all market      participants) and there will be no transactions in which EPMI      knows that PGE is the counter-party before the transaction is      finalized.  Thus, Applicants contend that not only will PGE be      unable to negotiate special terms with EPMI through EnronOnline,      but EPMI will have no discretion to take actions which favor PGE.      Applicants further offer that procedures are performed by      computer and are not left to the discretion of any affiliate of      PGE.  In addition, because the EnronOnline price is posted      electronically and is available to all market participants,      Applicants state that PGE's customers have the opportunity to      transact with EPMI on EnronOnline on the same terms and      conditions that are available to PGE.            Applicants have failed to demonstrate that their proposed      restrictions provide the same protections afforded under the      Commission's affiliate abuse requirements and conditions (e.g.,      protection against PGE buying too high or selling too low in its                                            8      transactions with its affiliate EPMI).   The thrust of      Applicants' argument is that the Commission's affiliate abuse      concerns are satisfied by using EnronOnline, a public medium, for      selling power between affiliates.  We disagree.  While perhaps      faster and easier to use than phone calls, faxes, or letters, an      Internet-based platform is just another medium for trade, and      speed and ease of use do not dictate that the Commission's      affiliate abuse concerns have been satisfied.  There is, for      example, no assurance that the posted prices on EnronOnline                                         9      represent prevailing market prices.            Applicants contend that, since PGE can transact with EPMI      via EnronOnline only at the posted price, there can be no      affiliate abuse.  We are not certain, however, that the posted      price necessarily represents the market price.  While, on the      surface, Enron Online may bear some resemblance to an index or an      auction, the posted prices for any product may not be the result      of a competitive market of multiple buyers and sellers; in fact,      for sales the posted prices represent what EPMI is willing to      sell at, and for purchases the posted prices represent what EPMI                           10      is willing to buy at.    For other transactions through media      other than EnronOnline, including other exchanges, EPMI might be                 8                 See supra notes 4-5 and accompanying text (citing cases           that discuss Commission's underlying concerns with affiliate           power sales).                9                 See supra note 4 and accompanying text.                10                  All transaction on EnronOnline involve EPMI as a           participant.  For sales, EPMI is the seller.  For purchases, EPMI           is the buyer.                  Docket Nos. ER01-2097-000 -5-           and ER01-2103-000                                                               11      willing to sell at lower prices and buy at higher prices.      Moreover, Applicants provide no information about how product      prices posted by EPMI are determined, or whether there would be      any restrictions on what products PGE could trade via      EnronOnline, or even whether there are other similar, but non-      affiliated, Internet-based venues where PGE can electronically      trade those products to attain similar benefits.            Having failed to convince us that these affiliates will be      transacting at a prevailing market price via EnronOnline, we now      turn to whether the Applicants have met other conditions      established by the Commission to prevent affiliate abuse.      Regarding transactions in which EPMI may be purchasing from PGE      through EnronOnline, there is nothing in the Applicants' proposed      restrictions that would require PGE to      simultaneously offer to sell to non-affiliates at the same rate      offered to the affiliate.  The Commission requires that, with      respect to any power offered to its affiliate, PGE make the same      offer to unaffiliated entities at the same time through its      electronic bulletin board.  But it is unclear whether PGE can or      will make the same offer to non-affiliates.            Applicants also offer as a protection that PGE is prohibited      from submitting Limit Orders, which would prevent EPMI from      knowing that PGE is the counter-party to a transaction.  Again,      this would not prevent EPMI from selling power to PGE at above-      market prices.            The Commission is not assured by the Applicants' proposal      that transactions between PGE and EPMI conducted via EnronOnline      will occur in a manner that is consistent with the Commission's      expectations regarding transparent and reasonable prices for      inter-affiliate power sales transactions.  There is, for example,      no provision in the proposed amendments regarding how      unaffiliated customers, or other interested parties, would      monitor inter-affiliate transactions.            For the above reasons, we will reject the proposed      amendments, without prejudice to Applicants revising their      proposal to address the Commission's concerns and incorporating      appropriate restrictions to protect against affiliate abuse.                       11                  Likewise, PGE might be willing to buy at lower prices and           sell at higher prices.                  Docket Nos. ER01-2097-000 -6-           and ER01-2103-000       The Commission orders:            Applicants' proposed tariff amendments are hereby rejected,       without prejudice, as discussed in the body of this order.

"Had a great weekend and looking forward to next time.  Hope you made it back to town ok.  I had no problems but I think you should just assume that from the Newark airport it's at least 2.5 hours, probably a bit more.

As it turns out I did not need it for Brad.  Brad did ask me to follow up on two items --   Item 1)  Brad was interested if we could share a list of people who visited the site.  So the users would obviously be a subset of this list.  Any thoughts on this matter?  If the customer visits would not work then --  Item 2)  Brad is interested in a workaround.  I shared the idea (at a high level) of a campaign to persuade the users to grant us permission to use their names. Brad wanted to be sure that several points would be addressed with whatever the workaround was.  His concerns are as follows: 1) we want to be as unobtrusive to the EOL customers as possible, 2) in any transaction we need to give the customer value, and 3)  the EOL customers would need to know how we would use the information if they did grant permission to share their data.  Suggested Action:  I would like to meet with you to talk further about any workarounds you might suggest which would address these issues.  After I have a clear understanding of your workaround which addresses the above issues I can then run it by Brad for his approval and then figure out who best to implement.  In this regards do you think we could meet tomorrow at 9:00 a.m. (in your office) for 30 minutes to discuss?

In what significant ways does Enron Online differ from the London Metal  Exchange or the New York Mercantile Exchange in the trading of futures  contracts (apart from the specific metals it trades) or from other on-line  exchanges in the trading of physical metal?  2.  What are the most important benefits that a public exchange like Enron's  brings to the steel industry?  3.  Does Enron have a trade clearing mechanism to guarantee the  creditworthiness of suppliers and customers?  4.  Why have some on-line steel trading sites failed?  5.  Are there particular problems in trading steel on-line versus oil,  agricultural products, or any of the other products that are successfully  traded on-line?  Any information you are able to supply would be greatly appreciated.

In what significant ways does Enron Online differ from the London Metal  Exchange or the New York Mercantile Exchange in the trading of futures  contracts (apart from the specific metals it trades) or from other on-line  exchanges in the trading of physical metal?  2.  What are the most important benefits that a public exchange like Enron's  brings to the steel industry?  3.  Does Enron have a trade clearing mechanism to guarantee the  creditworthiness of suppliers and customers?  4.  Why have some on-line steel trading sites failed?  5.  Are there particular problems in trading steel on-line versus oil,  agricultural products, or any of the other products that are successfully  traded on-line?

One is for a 464 which is about the size of boat we had last time but with 4 cabins and 2 heads (last time was 3 cabins, 3 heads which would be better for a smaller group but they're already booked).  The other is for a 505, a 50' boat with four main cabins, each with its own head, and a fifth smaller cabin in the forepeak.  If we have need for the fourth cabin, I'd be inclined to go with the larger boat.

"1.  EnronOnline is not an exchange, it is a bilateral transaction system.  It differs from futures exchanges in many respects including the following:  (i)an Enron entity is a counterparty to every transaction concluded over the system; (ii) EnronOnline transactions are not cleared;  (iii) the transactions concluded on the system are forward contracts or derivatives, not futures; and (iv) access to EnronOnline is restricted to commercial entities, i.e. no retail transactions are concluded on EnronOnline.  3.  EnronOnline transactions are not cleared through any third party mechanism.

In what significant ways does Enron Online differ from the London Metal  Exchange or the New York Mercantile Exchange in the trading of futures  contracts (apart from the specific metals it trades) or from other on-line  exchanges in the trading of physical metal?  2.  What are the most important benefits that a public exchange like Enron's  brings to the steel industry?  3.  Does Enron have a trade clearing mechanism to guarantee the  creditworthiness of suppliers and customers?  4.  Why have some on-line steel trading sites failed?  5.  Are there particular problems in trading steel on-line versus oil,  agricultural products, or any of the other products that are successfully  traded on-line?

EnronOnline is not an exchange, it is a bilateral transaction system.  It differs from futures exchanges in many respects including the following:  (i)an Enron entity is a counterparty to every transaction concluded over the system; (ii) EnronOnline transactions are not cleared;  (iii) the transactions concluded on the system are forward contracts or derivatives, not futures; and (iv) access to EnronOnline is restricted to commercial entities, i.e. no retail transactions are concluded on EnronOnline.  3.  EnronOnline transactions are not cleared through any third party mechanism.  Enron evaluates the credit of its customers and determines how much credit exposure it is willing to take with respect to each of them.   -----Original Message----- From: Yoho, Lisa  Sent: Friday, August 10, 2001 11:12 AM To: Taylor, Mark E (Legal) Subject: FW: E-commerce and steel   Mark: Could you (or someone in your group) help with questions 1 and 3?

In what significant ways does Enron Online differ from the London Metal  Exchange or the New York Mercantile Exchange in the trading of futures  contracts (apart from the specific metals it trades) or from other on-line  exchanges in the trading of physical metal?  2.  What are the most important benefits that a public exchange like Enron's  brings to the steel industry?  3.  Does Enron have a trade clearing mechanism to guarantee the  creditworthiness of suppliers and customers?  4.  Why have some on-line steel trading sites failed?  5.  Are there particular problems in trading steel on-line versus oil,  agricultural products, or any of the other products that are successfully  traded on-line?  Any information you are able to supply would be greatly appreciated.

Dear Friend and Future Millionaire, My wife received this e-mail and forwarded it to me to review. We've both read completely through it and have been in contact with some of the individuals listed below. We think it's an excellent opportunity that is well worth the small investment of time and money, and believe that you will, too! CRH  AS SEEN ON NATIONAL TV:  Making over half million dollars every 4 to 5 months from your home for an investment of only $25 U.S. Dollars expense one time THANKS TO THE COMPUTER AGE AND THE INTERNET !  BE A MILLIONAIRE LIKE OTHERS WITHIN A YEAR!!! Before you say ''Bull'', please read the following. This is the letter you have been hearing about on the news lately. Due to the popularity of this letter on the Internet, a national weekly news program recently devoted an entire show to the investigation of this program described below, to see if it really can make people money. The show also investigated whether or not the program was legal. Their findings proved once and for all that there are ''absolutely NO Laws prohibiting the participation in the program and if people can -follow the simple instructions, they are bound to make some mega bucks with only $25 out of pocket cost''. DUE TO THE RECENT INCREASE OF POPULARITY & RESPECT THIS PROGRAM HAS ATTAINED, IT IS CURRENTLY WORKING BETTER THAN EVER. This is what one had to say: ''Thanks to this profitable opportunity. I was approached many times before but each time I passed on it. I am so glad I finally joined just to see what one could expect in return for the minimal effort and money required. To my astonishment, I received total $610,470.00 in 21 weeks, with money still coming in."" Pam Hedland, Fort Lee, New Jersey   ---------------------------------------------------------------------------  Here is another testimonial:  ""This program has been around for a long time but I never believed in it. But one day when I received this again in the mail I decided to gamble my $25 on it. I followed the simple instructions and walaa ...... 3 weeks later the money started to come in. First month I only made $240.00 but the next 2 months after that I made a total of $290,000.00. So far, in the past 8 months by re-entering the program, I have made over $710,000.00 and I am playing it again. The key to success in this program is to follow the simple steps and NOT change anything.''  More testimonials later but first, ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ===== PRINT THIS NOW FOR YOUR FUTURE REFERENCE ======  If you would like to make at least $500,000 every 4 to 5 months easily and comfortably, please read the following... THEN READ IT AGAIN and AGAIN!!!  FOLLOW THE SIMPLE INSTRUCTION BELOW AND YOUR FINANCIAL DREAMS WILL COME TRUE, GUARANTEED! INSTRUCTIONS:  Order all 5 reports shown on the list below  For each report, send $5 CASH, THE NAME & NUMBER OF THE REPORT YOU ARE ORDERING and YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS to the person whose name appears ON THAT LIST next to the report. MAKE SURE YOUR RETURN ADDRESS IS ON YOUR ENVELOPE TOP LEFT CORNER in case of any mail problems.  When you place your order, make sure you order each of the 5 reports. You will need all 5 reports so that you can save them on your computer and resell them. YOUR TOTAL COST $5 X 5=$25.00. Within a few days you will receive, vie e-mail, each of the 5 reports from these 5 different individuals. Save them on your computer so they will be accessible for you to send to the 1,000's of people who will order them from you. Also make a floppy of these reports and keep it on your desk in case something happens to your computer.  --------------------------------------------------------------------------- IMPORTANT - DO NOT alter the names of the people who are listed next to each report, or their sequence on the list, in any way other than what is instructed below in step '' 1 through 6 '' or you will loose out on a majority of your profits. Once you understand the way this works, you will also see how it does not work if you change it. Remember, this method has been tested, and if you alter, it will NOT work !!! People have tried to put their friends/relatives names on all five thinking they could get all the money. But it does not work this way. Believe us, and Do Not try to change anything other than what is instructed. Because if you do, it will not work for you. Remember, honesty reaps the reward!!!  --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 1.... After you have ordered all 5 reports, take this advertisement and REMOVE the name & address of the person in REPORT # 5. This person has made it through the cycle and is no doubt counting their fortune 2.... Move the name & address in REPORT # 4 down TO REPORT # 5. 3.... Move the name & address in REPORT # 3 down TO REPORT # 4. 4.... Move the name & address in REPORT # 2 down TO REPORT # 3. 5.... Move the name & address in REPORT # 1 down TO REPORT # 2 6.... Insert YOUR name & address in the REPORT # 1 Position. PLEASE MAKE SURE you copy every name & address ACCURATELY!   Take this entire letter, with the modified list of names, and save it on your computer. DO NOT MAKE ANY OTHER CHANGES.  Save this on a disk as well just in case if you loose any data. To assist you with marketing your business on the internet, the 5 reports you purchase will provide you with invaluable marketing information which includes how to send bulk e-mails legally, where to find thousands of free classified ads and much more.  There are 2 Primary methods to get this venture going: METHOD # 1: BY SENDING BULK E-MAIL LEGALLY THROUGH A COMPANY LIKE ASTRO LEADS (360-358-3471)  Let's say that you decide to start small, just to see how it goes, and we will assume You and those involved send out only 5,000 e-mails each. Let's also assume that the mailing receive only a 0.2% response (the response could be much better but lets just say it is only 0.2%. Also many people will send out hundreds of thousands e-mails instead of only 5,000 each). Continuing with this example, you send out only 5,000 e-mails. With a 0.2% response, that is only 10 orders for report # 1. Those 10 people responded by sending out 5,000 e-mail each for a total of 50,000. Out of those 50,000 e-mails only 0.2% responded with orders. That's=100 people responded and ordered Report # 2.  Those 100 people mail out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 500, 000 e-mails. The 0.2% response to that is 1000 orders for Report # 3.  Those 1000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 5 million e-mails sent out. The 0.2% response to that is 10,000 orders for Report # 4.  Those 10,000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 50,000,000 (50 million) e-mails.  The 0.2% response to that is 100,000 orders for Report # 5 THAT'S 100,000 ORDERS TIMES $5 EACH=$500,000.00 (half million). Your total income in this example is: 1..... $50 + 2..... $500 + 3.... $5,000 + 4.... $50,000 + 5..... $500,000 ........ Grand Total=$555,550.00   NUMBERS DO NOT LIE. GET A PENCIL & PAPER AND FIGURE OUT THE WORST POSSIBLE RESPONSES AND NO MATTER HOW YOU CALCULATE IT, YOU WILL STILL MAKE A LOT OF MONEY ! ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  REMEMBER FRIEND, THIS IS ASSUMING ONLY 10 PEOPLE ORDERING OUT OF 5,000 YOU MAILED TO. Dare to think for a moment what would happen if everyone or half or even one 4th of those people mailed 100,000e-mails each or more? There are over 150 million people on the Internet worldwide and counting. Believe me, many people will do just that, and more!   ---------------------------------------------------------------------------  METHOD # 2 : BY PLACING FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET Advertising on the net is very inexpensive and there are hundreds of FREE places to advertise. Placing a lot of free ads on the Internet will easily get a larger response. We strongly suggest you start with Method # 1 and add METHOD # 2 as you go along. For every $5 you receive, all you must do is e-mail them the Report they ordered. That's it. Always provide same day service on all orders. This will guarantee that the e-mail they send out, with your name and address on it, will be prompt because they can not advertise until they receive the report. =========== AVAILABLE REPORTS ==================== ORDER EACH REPORT BY ITS NUMBER & NAME ONLY. ==================================================== Notes: 1) Always send $5 cash (U.S. CURRENCY only) for each Report. Checks NOT accepted.  2) Make sure the cash is concealed by wrapping it in at least 2 sheets of paper.  3) On one of those sheets of paper, Write:  1. the NUMBER & the NAME of the Report you are ordering,  2. YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS and  3. your name and postal address. (In case of e-mail difficulties. ) PLACE YOUR ORDER FOR THESE REPORTS NOW :  REPORT #1 ""The Insider's Guide to Advertising for Free on the Net"" ORDER REPORT #1 FROM: Hi - Tech Solutions P O Box 53111 Irvine, Ca. 92619 - 3111 ________________________________________ REPORT #2 ""The Insider's Guide to Sending Bulk E-mail on the Net"" ORDER REPORT #2 FROM: Jean P.

Reed 4719 Reed Rd. suite 312 Columbus,OH.43220  You can KEEP TRACK of your PROGRESS by watching which report people are ordering from you. IF YOU WANT TO GENERATE MORE INCOME SEND ANOTHER BATCH OF E-MAILS AND START THE WHOLE PROCESS AGAIN. ____________________________________________________________ $$$$$$$$$ YOUR SUCCESS GUIDELINES $$$$$$$$$$$  Follow these guidelines to guarantee your success:  === If you do not receive at least 10 orders for Report #1 within 3 weeks, continue sending e-mails until you do. === After you have received 10 orders, 2 to 3 weeks after that you should receive 100 orders or more for REPORT # 2. If you did not, continue advertising or sending e-mails until you do. === Once you have received 100 or more orders for Report # 2, YOU CAN RELAX, because the system is already working for you, and the cash will continue to roll in ! THIS IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER: Every time your name is moved down on the list, you are placed in front of a Different report.  There is NO LIMIT to the income you can generate from this business !! ! ====================================================== FOLLOWING IS A NOTE FROM THE ORIGINATOR OF THIS PROGRAM: You have just received information that can give you financial freedom for the rest of your life, with NO RISK and JUST A LITTLE BIT OF EFFORT. You can make more money in the next few weeks and months than you have ever imagined. Follow the program EXACTLY AS INSTRUCTED. Do Not change it in any way. It works exceedingly well as it is now. Remember to e-mail a copy of this exciting report after you have put your name and address in Report #1 and moved others to #2 ........... # 5 as instructed above. One of the people you send this to may send out 100,000 or more e-mails and your name will be on every one of them. Remember though, the more you send out the more potential customers you will reach. So my friend, I have given you the ideas, information, materials and opportunity to become financially independent. IT IS UP TO YOU NOW ! ============ MORE TESTIMONIALS ================ ""My name is Mitchell. My wife, Jody and I live in Chicago. I am an accountant with a major U.S. Corporation and I make pretty good money. When I received this program I grumbled to Jody about receiving ''junk mail''. I made fun of the whole thing, spouting my knowledge of the population and percentages involved. I ''knew'' it wouldn't work. Jody totally ignored my supposed intelligence and few days later she jumped in with both feet. I made merciless fun of her, and was ready to lay the old ''I told you so'' on her when the thing didn't work. Well, the laugh was on me! Within 3 weeks she had received 50 responses. Within the next 45 days she had received total $ 147,200.00 ........... all cash! I was shocked. I have joined Jody in her ''hobby''. Mitchell Wolf M.D., Chicago, Illinois ====================================================== ''Not being the gambling type, it took me several weeks to make up my mind to participate in this plan. But conservative that I am, I decided that the initial investment was so little that there was just no way that I wouldn't get enough orders to at least get my money back''. '' I was surprised when I found my medium size post office box crammed with orders. I made $319,210.00 in the first 12 weeks. The nice thing about this deal is that it does not matter where people live. There simply isn't a better investment with a faster return and so big."" Dan Sondstrom, Alberta, Canada ======================================================= ''I had received this program before. I deleted it, but later I wondered if I should have given it a try. Of course, I had no idea who to contact to get another copy, so I had to wait until I was e-mailed again by someone else.........11 months passed then it luckily came again...... I did not delete this one! I made more than $490,000 on my first try and all the money came within 22 weeks."" Susan De Suza, New York, N.Y. ======================================================= ''It really is a great opportunity to make relatively easy money with little cost to you. I followed the simple instructions carefully and within 10 days the money started to come in. My first month I made $20,560.00 and by the end of third month my total cash count was $362,840.00. Life is beautiful, Thanks to internet."". Fred Dellaca, Westport, New Zealand   ======================================================= ORDER YOUR REPORTS TODAY AND GET STARTED ON 'YOUR' ROAD TO FINANCIAL FREEDOM ! ======================================================= About 50,000 new people get online every month! _______________________________________________________   Under Bill S1618 Title III passed by the 105th US Congress this letter cannot be considered spam as long as the sender includes contact information and a method of removal.

"Mark, It has been a while since we last discussed the Oracle, TIBCO and BEAS contacts and what effect, if any, they will have on our e-commerce solutions that we are presenting to third parties.  As a review the following are the basic sets of offerings: 1) Third parties (gas pipelines, gas storage companies) will post their products on the EnronOnline website. 2) EnronOnline will build a private e-marketplace, essentially an EnronOnline look-alike, for third parties. EnronOnline will host the private e-marketplace using Enron hardware on Enron's premises. (Note: a second tier to this offering will allow the same third party to cross post its products simultaneously on EnronOnline as well as the private e-marketplace.) 3) A software license giving a third party the right to use EnronOnline software but maintain the application and website on its own premises using its own hardware. 4) A software sale (selling the object or source code) of EnronOnline software to third parties. At one point,  we were expecting a response from outside legal council. Did we ever get anything in writing? If so, would you please forward it to me.

"Fertilizers brochure - final text file 2001   [Cover]  FERTILIZERS  It's time to manage your price risk. Logo [Spread 1] Managing Price Risk For producers and consumers of ammonia and fertilizers, price volatility is an all-too-familiar cost of doing business. To compete effectively in your industry, you need a way to control the risk created by price volatility. Enron can help with financial price management tools that can smooth earnings, facilitate cash flow management, and bring greater certainty to financing, investment and acquisition decisions.    Helping Ammonia and Fertilizer Producers Improve their Business Few industries are more competitive or volatile than ammonia or fertilizers. From the very unstable pricing found in the markets for raw materials to the ebb and flow of market demand for finished products, producers can face enormous challenges in maintaining profit margins and cash flows. Now there's help. For many years, Enron has been helping producers like you neutralize the risk of price volatility both upstream and downstream, using financial price management tools we pioneered more than a decade ago for the energy industry. Because Enron is a major trader of many commodities around the world, we're intimately familiar with the risks you face and are uniquely positioned to help you mitigate them.  Enron can also make it easier for you to trade the commodities you buy and sell, using EnronOnline, our Internet-based, global transaction system for commodities that allows you to view real-time prices and transact instantly online. EnronOnline posts bid and offer prices for over 1,500 global commodity products as well as complimentary weather, news and market information. In addition, it allows you to view full contractual terms and available volumes for products. [Spread 2] Finally, we can leverage, in your market, our position as the largest wholesaler of natural gas and electricity in North America. For example, we can structure cross-commodity transactions that link your electricity or natural gas bills to the price of the goods you produce. In this type of transaction, you would pay more for energy when your product prices are high when you can best afford it, and less when your product prices are low and your cash flows are constrained.  Helping Ammonia and Fertilizer Consumers Improve their Business  The ammonia and fertilizer markets that you depend upon are among the most volatile in the world. Yet your investors and lenders are demanding ever-greater stability in the growth of your company's revenues, earnings and cash-flow. For solutions to this apparent paradox, turn to Enron. As a leading provider of price management services across various industries, we can help you buy the commodities you need more efficiently, hedge the risks associated with their pricing, and, ultimately, lower your cost of capital.  Take a few moments to review the alternatives listed here, then spend a few more moments with Enron. We'll review your risk exposure with you and suggest risk-reducing strategies for taking control of your commodity price exposure. [Spread 3]  SWAPS  Swaps are the most widely used price risk management tool for a variety of reasons, the most common being, no upfront transaction cost.  Swaps give companies the ability to effectively switch from one price structure to another - from floating price to fixed or vice versa. They are used most often to fix, or lock in, prices and margins between prices. In exchange for price protection, the ability to capitalize on some beneficial price movements is sacrificed. The typical swap transaction involves the exchange of a fixed price for a variable price tied to an acceptable market index. Settlement is financial - i.e., cash changes hands; physical product does not. Each month during the life of the transaction, the difference between the two prices is calculated and payment is made to the appropriate party. [Spread 4]  Swap: Producer example   AmmoniaKing, a producer of ammonia, is interested in managing the margin between natural gas feedstock and ammonia during the next six months. The company is concerned that market conditions could deteriorate more than expected and squeeze margins to the point of jeopardizing the annual profit plan. To eliminate this threat, AmmoniaKing enters into a swap with Enron that locks in the spread between natural gas and ammonia at $100/ton on 300,000 tons of ammonia, or 75 percent of monthly production. This margin virtually ensures that the ammonia unit will meet its financial target. [chart 1]  DURING THE LIFE OF THE SWAP:  ?        AmmoniaKing continues to purchase natural gas from suppliers and sell ammonia to customers of its choice, at floating market prices. ?        On a monthly basis, AmmoniaKing and Enron exchange payments equal to the difference between the fixed spread of $100/ton and the prevailing floating price spread. ?        For example, if the floating spread is $95/ton in a given month, AmmoniaKing will receive $5/ton in a given month on 300,000 tons. However, if the floating spread is $105/ton AmmoniaKing will owe $5/ton to Enron. ?        AmmoniaKing has stabilized a portion of its operating margin with the swap, giving the company the ability to achieve a key performance target.   [Spread 5]  Swap: End-user example   FertPro, a manufacturer of a variety of fertilizer products, is preparing its annual price catalog for many of its ammonia-based products. The company's customer base demands the ability to buy the products at the listed catalog price regardless of ammonia feedstock prices. This makes it impossible for FertPro to pass on feedstock price increases no matter what the magnitude. On the other hand, customers don't necessarily expect lower prices if ammonia feedstock prices should fall; they simply want a listed price they can count on. To service its customers while protecting its margins, FertPro enters into a one-year price swap. The swap effectively fixes the price of ammonia at $100/ton on a monthly volume of 10,000 tons, or 75 percent of anticipated monthly catalog sales. [chart 2]  DURING THE LIFE OF THE SWAP:  ?        FertPro continues to purchase ammonia from suppliers of its choice at floating market prices. ?        On a monthly basis, FertPro and Enron exchange payments equal to the difference between the swap fixed price of $100/ton and the floating price for ammonia. ?        For example, if the floating price for ammonia is $105 in a given month, FertPro will receive $5/ton on 10,000 tons. However, if the floating price is $95/ton FertPro will owe $5/ton to Enron. ?        The net effect of combining the swap cash flows with actual purchases of ammonia feedstock is a fixed price of $100/ton. ?        The swap enables FertPro to publish and stand behind its listed prices with full confidence that the margin on those sales is largely protected from fluctuating feedstock prices.   [Spread 6]  CAPS & FLOORS  Like Swaps, Caps and Floors provide price protection, but they have the added advantage of providing benefit from favorable price movements. They are commonly thought of as price ""insurance,"" i.e., for a premium you are entitled to full price protection when prices move through a specified level. A price Cap protects against rising prices without sacrificing the advantage of falling prices. Floors are the opposite of Caps; they guard against falling prices while preserving upside price potential. With a Cap or Floor, the full cost of the protection is predefined - it is equal to the premium paid for the Cap or Floor. There are no potential future costs related to price movements. [Spread 7]  Cap: End-User example  CropFood, a manufacturer of urea, wants to develop business with a prospect that has difficulty passing on price increases, but is expected to pass on decreases without delay. To distinguish itself from competitors, CropFood ensures the prospect that for the next 12 months, CropFood will never ask for a price increase above its very competitive product prices, no matter how high ammonia feedstock prices go. And to sweeten the deal, CropFood agrees to promptly pass on all feedstock price decreases as soon as they are announced, no questions asked. The prospect likes CropFood's straightforward pricing policy and agrees to purchase 1,000 tons of urea per month. In order to honor its pricing promise without putting the company's margins at risk to rising prices, CropFood purchases a one-year price cap on ammonia at $120/ton for 12,000 tons per month. The cost of the cap is $2/ton. [chart 3]  DURING THE LIFE OF THE CAP AGREEMENT:  ?        CropFood continues to buy ammonia from its regular suppliers at market prices. ?        Enron receives a $2/ton premium from CropFood for the $120/ton price cap. ?        If the market price for ammonia goes above $120/ton in a given month, Enron will pay the difference to CropFood. If prices are less than $120/ton, CropFood enjoys the lower market prices for its feedstock. ?        The effective cost of ammonia paid by CropFood is the floating market price up to a maximum of $120/ton plus the $2/ton premium paid for the cap. ?        CropFood has, for a known cost of $2/ton captured new business by meeting the customer's price needs without putting the company at risk to ammonia prices in the process.   [Spread 8]  Floor: Producer example  AmmoniaKing, a producer of ammonia, anticipates a plant turnaround starting in three months time and lasting for two months. The company intends to build extra ammonia inventory of 50,000 tons over the next three months to meet sales obligations during the two-month period the plant is taken off-line. There is concern that prices could soften over the two-month turnaround period, squeezing the margin on the excess inventory to be sold during that time. To protect against a sharp price reduction during the turnaround period, AmmoniaKing buys a two-month ammonia price floor today that becomes effective in three months time. The floor price is set at $145 and costs $3/ton. The total premium payable by AmmoniaKing is $150,000 (50,000 tons multiplied by $3/ton). [chart 4]    EACH MONTH DURING THE LIFE OF THE PRICE FLOOR:  ?        AmmoniaKing sells excess ammonia inventory to its customers at prevailing market (floating) prices. ?        Enron receives a $3/ton premium from AmmoniaKing for the $145/ton price floor. ?        If the floating price for ammonia is greater than the $145/ton floor price, there is no action under the floor contract. The effective price received by AmmoniaKing for its ammonia is the floating market price less the $3/ton premium. ?        If the floating price goes below the $145/ton floor price to $140/ton, for example, AmmoniaKing will receive the $5/ton difference from Enron. In this instance, AmmoniaKing effective price for ammonia is $142/ton - the $145/ton floor price less the $3/ton premium. ?        In summary, the price floor has established a minimum price of $145/ton with full upside potential at a known cost of $3/ton.

"Would there be any interest in using the Auction functions on EOL for this product instead of a product line?  There is a lot of flexibility in setting the rules -- reserve prices or not, sale commitment or not, timing, etc. -- and you would have the added benefit of finding out where customers were willing to transact if our price was too high for them.   I assume we are only showing one side of this market.   -----Original Message----- From:  Kitchen, Louise   Sent: Wednesday, August 29, 2001 6:20 PM To: Thome, Stephen; Richter, Brad; Calger, Christopher F.

Cc: Webb, Jay; Taylor, Mark E (Legal) Subject: RE: eNYMEX  Brad,  We may consider targeting a wide audience.  Since these turbines are not the technology of choice for many large corporate entities, our target audience may need to be somewhat more diverse.  Our only prerequisite for purchase is the ability to raise $31 MM (plus option fees).  I have two primary documents.  One is the spec sheet and a general scope.  The other is a turbine purchase agreement.  A counterparty can have two options:  One is to contact us to provide a bid.  There would be no price assurance or exclusivity in this case.  Their other choice is to accept our offer on a turbine option contract.  For $1 MM, they would have a 30 day call on the turbines, during which they would be permitted to conduct their due diligence.  The $1 MM buys them price assurance and an exclusivity period.    It may be a nuance, but our offer price is on the call not the actual turbine.  Is this consistent with EOL's format?

But if a counterparty clicks on the Offer, we could replace the GTC's with a Term Sheet or LOI which binds the counterparty to 30 days of diligence with a break-up fee if the deal doesn't close.  If the company isn't willing to commit to that, the contact information will be their route to getting more information.  Thoughts?

The turbines idea on EOL.  I don't want to post an advetisement only I want them to post the turbines themselves.  So essentially just like a new product launch we would have a pop up announcing a new product and the new product would be our turbines - exactly the same as any other product.  They have to post the turbines out there and obviously there will only be an offer and they will be for the ABBs we actually have in Canada.  You never know someone may click - it would be an interesting concept and probably non-binding as there would be site inspections etc.  But not an advert - actually posting the turbines.

Short answer-- we've got it as covered as possible for now.    Another item:  I got a call from Stephen Thome in ENA who wanted us to post something like an advertisement for your turbines on EnronOnline.  Jay confirmed that it was technically feasible to craft a pop-up that targets certain customers with information and links to documents and spec sheets.  I'm told we have resisted this approach in the past because it has the potential to get out of hand once the genie gets out of the bottle, so to speak.  I think it fits well for the turbines, but I wanted to make sure you were behind this idea before we launched into development.

Bo is keenly aware that the NYMEX has fallen down in two areas--first, catering too much to the locals, while ignoring their true customer base and secondly, not following through with the eNYMEX rollout. Bo along with Vincent Viola, the new Chairman of the NYMEX are dedicated to correcting these two problems immediately. Personally, I think there is a chance that EnronOnline could partner with the NYMEX and it could benefit both. Obviously, they need us far more than we need them, but there is a window of opportunity due to the recent change in the NYMEX management. Is this something of interest and if so, should we follow up? Bo and Vince will be in Houston in late August for a NYMEX cocktail party at ROCC and I could arrange a meeting at Enron.

[Hernandez, Nancy]   A COB report is run on every trading day.  The report has hard coded limits set based on Nymex limits report provided by Tana Jones (legal).         1.  What system is utilized in this monitoring process, and how often are NYMEX violations monitored?   [Hernandez, Nancy]  Daily  Has there ever been any problems with this system?   [Hernandez, Nancy]  No.  Data is captured based on Tagg deal entry attributes Could we obtain current copies of the reports that are used to monitor NYMEX violations? [Hernandez, Nancy]   I would have to clear the issuance of the reports, but I don't think it would be an issue.         2.  What procedures are performed when Enron is approaching a limit? [Hernandez, Nancy]   Notification of Business Unit Risk Manager or Director.  [Hernandez, Nancy]  Report is issued daily to specific groups.    Do traders notify you prior to exceeding a limit and do they perform monitoring procedures too?    [Hernandez, Nancy]  I am not sure if they do their own procedures.   Who do you contact, and what is the timeline in regards to sending a letter to the NYMEX?   [Hernandez, Nancy]  No known correspondence with NyMex Could we get a copy of any recent correspondence with the NYMEX when Enron was approaching a limit? [Hernandez, Nancy]   No know correspondence.       3.  Are the procedures the same when you see a violation has occurred?  Legal to answer What penalties are assessed for noncompliance?   [Hernandez, Nancy]  Legal to answer Have penalties ever been incurred? [Hernandez, Nancy]   legal to Answer      It is my understanding after talking to Jennifer Nguyen that you    performed a reconciliation of all of the source systems to RisktRAC.    Additionally, she indicated that since January, any new curve added is    notified, documented, and monitored by the Risk Controls Group.  What is    this process?  Are there any forms utilized?  Would it be possible to    get copies of the reconciliations performed and forms utilized, if any,    in the addition of new curves?     For inclusion in the AO1 Report, is it accurate that Credit inputs the    data into Risky Business and the Risk Controls Group provides the report    to upper management.  If not, does Risk Controls Group input these deals    not captured in the system?  What is this process?  If you have any questions, please feel free to call me at x56959.

We are trying to improve the language relating to the termination payment (Section 5.4) in the bandwidth trading master.  The old version had a very complicated and repetitive formula that tried to reflect replacement costs but in practice did not do so (I will not go into why here).  Based on some ISDA materials sent to me by Elizabeth Sager, as well as the benefit of the trading forms in some of our other businesses, we have come up with the  attached.  I would be so grateful if you could give me some feedback on this 5.4 as soon as you can because we are a bit strapped in producing agreements.    As I mentioned to Mark on the phone today, I am also trying to work out how critical is the provision allowing for payment by the non-defaulting party to the defaulting party.  As we know, most of the time a non-defaulting party would not elect to terminate if they thought they were going to have to make a payment, but given our strictly physical, not overly liquid market at the moment, this provision has the old time telecoms companies with their eyeballs swivelling around in their sockets (of course the agreement as a whole is a bit of a shock to them, but this seems to be the provision they cannot get their brains around).  Although I am not necessarily suggesting we take this feature out of the form, I would just like your thoghts on whether we have any flexibility to delete it where necessary.  Finally, I note that our form does not have any provision to suspend delivery if the buyer is not paying.  Again, given the physical delivery character of this market, I would recommend we add such a feature.  I will anxiously await your feedback...And again, many thanks.     -----Original Message----- From:  Wilson, Pauline   Sent: 09 August 2001 10:32 To: Vickerman, James Cc: Browning, Mary Nell Subject: Master Agreement - Form  James,   Here is the Master Agreement - Form.

"I hope this isn't too late.  If you need to reach me, I'm in the London office today and tomorrow.

Note that this needs to be done on a counterparty basis, not at the sub user level.  That needs to be clear from the language we use so I have avoided the chattier 'you' and used counterparty.

"Mark: Please review and get back to me asap with comments.  THANKS  Lisa   -----Original Message----- From:  Shelk, John   Sent: Tuesday, September 11, 2001 8:51 AM To: Robertson, Linda; Long, Chris; Shapiro, Richard; Yoho, Lisa; Briggs, Tom; Nicolay, Christi L.; Steffes, James D. Subject: Bingaman Draft On Transparency -- Amendment Ideas   Last night, Linda and I spent a fairly long time with Leon Lowery, Chairman Bingaman's chief electricity advisor, to discuss our concerns with the transparency and market-based rate language -- while at the same time commending the transmission access language in the draft and strategizing how to support the chairman in that regard.  We made progress on transparency, less so on market-based rates.  On transparency, Leon understands our concerns.  In a nutshell, he seemed amenable to amending the langauge to avoid the result of having to divulge transaction-specific, trade-specific information.  We persuaded Leon that was the impact of the initial language, although he initially said details would be left to FERC.  We persuaded him that if any data is to be provided, it MUST be only in aggregate form.  We also impressed on him that if, as he said, the intent is to leave details to FERC -- then more of the details should be left to FERC, not set by statute.  Leon strongly advised that we seek to craft language consistent with the above exchange that makes as few changes to the draft as needed to make the necessary corrections.  This will make it easier for Leon to navigate the internal waters of the staff.  (Sam Fowler, th chief counsel, is a drafting stickler).  Others should obviously weigh in and review this, but to facilitate internal comments (we need to get back to Leon today), here is my take on what he has in mind.  Under new sec. 218(b) (to be added to the FPA by bill sec. 413) (pg. 13), under ""information required"" we would rewrite paragraph 2 as follows:  (2)  each broker, exchange, or other market-making entity that matches offers to sell and offers to buy wholesale electric energy in interstate commerce to provide aggregate statistical information about its sales of electric energy at wholesale in interstate commerce.  The effect of the language change is drop the reference to sale prices of each sale of electric energy.  By leaving it as aggregate statistical information, this should give FERC maximum flexibility to permit indexes, etc.  As to the ""timely basis"" of information release (subsection (c)), the alternatives sent yesterday would require this to be done on the Internet after the end of the trading day.  If we can restrict this to aggregate data, question arises whether we want to concede that this would be done daily.  That suggests the data to be collected would be more than we would want, I think.  Here is a take on how we might suggest a revision to that language to give FERC more leeway:  ""(c) TIMELY BASIS -- The Commission shall require the information required under subsection (b) to be posted on the Internet and updated as frequently as practicable and appropriate.  The change is to add ""appropriate"" so that FERC can consider other than whether posting is practicable.  The use of ""appropriate"" is what came to mind -- perhaps there is some other word or phrase like ""consistent with ..."" or ""promote competition"" or some way of saying there are policy considerations other than practicability.  There should be some valid purpose established before data is released.  I would argue that the (d) language on commercially sensitive information goes only to exempting from disclosure, not when disclosure is appropriate.  Please let me have your thoughts, although the tragedy in NYC and DC now underway will probably make this not a day to transact such business on the Hill.  Will provide a further report on market-based rates.  In sum, Leon was not as sympathetic on this issue, but asked for our ideas and further arguments.  We sense Leon personally feels strongly about moving the FPA to some linkage to competitive markets.  His argument is that market participants can be doing everything by the book and the result can still be uncompetitive markets.  We pushed that penalizing us is not the answer -- nor is increasing regulatory uncertainty about deals doing to help keep prices down.  Leon clearly does not intend this language to punish Enron -- but others who we might all agree have done things that are not in keeping with competitive markets.",legal <.taylor@enron.com>,lisa.yoho@enron.com,FW: Bingaman Draft On Transparency -- Amendment Ideas,2001-09-12 07:51:37-07:00,received

"Mark -  I received your message and agree that this is probably a better way to communicate.  I spoke to Tom this morning. There is an industry hub meeting next week - with limited attendance.  While continuing to promote the neutrality of the CL hub, Tom would also like to move this industry issue forward by possibly promoting the sale of interests in the CL hub.  I asked whether or not the hub can be separated from the base CL product (e.g., the general infrastructure and individual modules) and Tom responded that it is quite possible to separate the hub (and its support mechanisms - including the data base information) from the CL product.  I suggested that we may want to consider separating the hub from the product (by formation of a different legal entity), but would imagine that we would need tax and other approvals.  Tom would like assistance in the following areas:   1.  General overview of the antitrust arena he would be dealing in.  I provided this consistent with my current understanding of antitrust matters in the e-commerce world (as confirmed by Ken Reisler at SC by previous discussions)  2.  General overview of the vehicles that could be used to form the hub organization (e.g., profit vs. non-profit companies, LLC's vs. other corporate forms, alliance/joint ventures).  While I have some background in a lot of these type of organizations, I do not have any experience with non-profit entities.  Should I get someone at V&E or Sullivan & Cromwell to assist or is there anyone internal you could suggest?  V&E may be a better choice here only because of the probability that all potential owners are located in Houston.  3.  General issues relating to confidentiality of discussions between potential hub owners.  While there is currently an NDA in place with a number of companies in relation to these discussions, Tom really sees only a handful being serious players.  Accordingly, it is possible Tom may want to spearhead conversations with only those few and possible move a project forward on a faster track.  The questions that have been raised are in relation to the manner in which these discussions should take place and how (if at all) they should be documented.  While I suggested that they should be under a secondary NDA and probably based upon some form of LOI or other intention memorandum, I believe we should get a clear indication of how to move forward so that we can ensure confidentiality, neutrality and avoidance of any future claims or concerns (e.g., antitrust concerns).  Is V&E the choice here also or should we talk to Sullivan personnel?  Tom will need some of this information for his meeting on Thursday.  Since I will be out of the office on Tuesday and Wednesday next week, I wanted to get the ball rolling this week.  Thanks.

"Thank you for your e-mail and phone call!  We received both and were really sorry not to be here when you called.  I guess we were both at work.  When we were watching this tragedy on TV Tuesday, we couldn't remember exactly when you were coming home, so called your office.  Holly called us back to say that you were due back Wednesday.  That was a relief because we knew you weren't in the air on Tuesday.  It just dawned on me this morning that your e-mail was from you usual address so you could probably receive mail in London at that address as well as send.  Tim called about 10:45 Tuesday morning to say that they weren't allowing anyone to leave his base so he was stuck there for awhile but Sharon was OK and going home.  Either his information was erroneous or the base was opened not long thereafter because he was also allowed to leave and both were home by early afternoon.  I was concerned about how long it would take Sharon to drive home because 20 years ago when I was driving home during a storm and all the government offices were closing, it was a zoo.  It turned out that Sharon drove right along the river and up Rock Creek Park with hardly any traffic since the streets between hers along the river and the rest of the city were already closed so no streets were emptying into hers.  Tim Bunce was in the air on his way to California.  They brought his flight down in Dallas and he was planning to drive home from Dallas. Someone at my office told me yesterday that her brother was stuck in Houston and was driving back to Cincinnati!  Nick's sixth grade class in Wyoming was told about the situation. I don't know if they let them watch the TV.  Janet was oblivious--out doing errands--so there was noone at home.  However, Ivan stopped by the house for some reason just when Nick called home.  Nick was concerned about you and Tim because he couldn't remember where you live.  That really touched me, that he would think of you and that the school let him call home.  I called them when Tim called to let us know they were all home safely and that you were in London.  At the time this was happening we had no idea where would be struck next.  You have probably heard that the FBI now says that the flight that went into the Pentagon was originally going to hit the White House and that the flight that went down over PA undoubtedly was bound for a more populated target.    We were watching when the towers collapsed and found it surreal--unbelievable.  We watched for some time after that but finally we couldn't stand it.  We just had to turn off the TV and do something else.  That seemed almost dishonorable though--to look outside on a beautiful sunny, peaceful day here.  We were having a primary election for mayor in the city so we went to vote because that was something positive we could accomplish.  During the rest of the day we checked the status of the situation regularly, but didn't watch for a prolonged time.  It was impossible to concentrate on much of anything.  Now I feel that we need to return to normal activities as much as possible to keep our little part of the country running as usual.  The terrorists will have done even more damage if we don't.  I imagine Enron has people marooned all over the world.  At least you have an Enron office where you are.  I should think that would be better than being stuck somewhere in Canada, wondering if you should drive home.  I hope they are providing you some space where you can accomplish something.  I imagine you are keeping the phone lines busy to Houston these days.  I just read in the Wall Street Journal this morning that the Y2K plans are paying off for some companies who had alternate plans for communication difficulties and even ""bunkers"" or alternate offices in place that they are now using.  This will surely be a test of our president and his government.  I hope they are up to it.  Please let us know when you finally get home.

"I'm fine.  I left you a voice mail this morning on your cell phone to let you know I'm OK and stranded in London.  Not a bad place to get stranded I suppose.  Linda and Amanda are here, too.  I'm working from the office here while they have fun on the town.  Actually, they seem to be spending a lot of time at the hotel watching the news, and I can't say that I totally blame them -- it seems almost disloyal to go out and have fun.  They were going to a play this afternoon and got tickets for us to see Mama Mia (the musical based on ABBA) for tomorrow night.  I was originally scheduled to fly back yesterday (Wednesday) and have been rebooked on a flight Sunday afternoon.  The hotel finally told me this morning that we can keep our rooms until then.  I hope the flights are running by then.  Kitty is being taken care of but I feel really bad having her be alone all this time.  Jim Avant was stranded in Austin for a day -- they had to take a taxi back to Houston the next day -- and Jamie said they would go over that afternoon.

"Mark, I can use your advise on a few new projects that I am working on.  1.  The weather desk is trying to roll out a HDD Swap for Calgary by Monday= .  Most of the anticipated buyers of the product will be Canadian counterpa= rties ECC has masters with.  The desk originally thought that we need to cr= eate a GTC for Enron Canada using the ENA weather GTC.  Because if the time=  issues involved in creating a new GTC (fixing all the things that are wron= g with the ENA form) I looked for a new way to deal with this issue.  I thi= nk I found it in section 3(d) of the ETA which provides that the Enron coun= terparty to a particular transaction will be the Enron Entity they have a m= aster with that covers that type of transaction.  I believe this provision = was a stroke of genius designed for just this type of scenario.  I can prep= are the long description to specify the Enron entity as ""the applicable Enr= on entity"" and if there is a master then the Enron Entity is the one with t= he master pursuant to Section 3(d) of the ETA and if there is no master the=  ETA says the GTC applies and the GTC specifies that ENA is the counterpart= y.  Do you think this works?  2.  I was contacted by someone at McKinsey & Company yesterday who is worki= ng with the weather desk to develop a Bermuda Transformer Commercial Struct= ure to partner up with the Insurance market to provide some capital to our = weather trading desk.  I have been told that conceptually it will be a Jedi=  type arrangement.  I have been asked to help them think through the issues=  and coordinate with the other attorneys who work on these types of issues.=   I do not want to get too deep into the structuring of this investment veh= icle myself without the appropriate legal group involved.  Would this be so= mething Jordan Mintz's group would handle or would this be something that L= ance Schuler's group would develop?  I thought I might want to talk to Juli= a Murrey (or Cristina Mordant or Carol St. Clair) to see what issues croppe= d up in the development of Jedi I and Jedi II (or maybe I should just talk = to whatever lawyer is currently handling these structures).  What are your = thoughts on how to move forward?  3.  The other rush deal is a financing deal out of Jordan's group.  The dea= l I helped look at that was a physical forward using ISDA type language is = now a financial deal (a series of Total Return Swaps) that needs to close n= ext Friday.  I will go to a meeting in the morning to try and get more info= rmation on the structure.  Angela Davis who has worked on the Total Return = swap deals has offered to help me pilot this through.  Sara thought I shoul= d check with you to make sure you don't have a problem with me taking on on= e of these deals.  I am going to try and make sure they have Danny Sullivan=  from A&K working on the deal since he is the most knowledgeable lawyer on = this type of structure. =20  I hope all goes well with your return flight plans.

" Mark,   Sara, Alan and I met this afternoon to discuss fallback pricing in the energy markets scenario....Sara had sat in on a morning telephone conference with a large number of the large institutional traders...John Nolan and John Wilson were the Enron reps on the call.  Sara noted that she thought there was a subsequent call with basically the same group, but that she did not attend.....we called John Wilson to see if there had been a subsequent meeting....he confirmed that there had been and that he had participated..   There appeared to be consensus as how to treat the failure of Platt to publish for the last 2 days. Since many oil traders use the Platt's index and since the oil contracts generally use a monthly average price, the consensus was to delete those days for which Platt did not publish and thus, have fewer days in the monthly average. The Enron oil traders have relatively insignificant contracts to which this index applies, and John Wilson was comfortable with this approach, and was planning to check with one additional trader and get back to Sara for final commercial sign off.  On the spreads between Brent products and TI products, it is common in the industry to only use dates in which both are being traded  (i.e. not July 4 and not the funky Brit banking holidays in August). This is referred to as ""common pricing"".  There was general consensus that in calculating prices for these spreads, the days where no U.S. prices were published would be treated as Non-common days and thus ignored in the calculation.  John says that Enron' s portfolio of these types of transaction is extremely small and thus, this acceptable to Enron.  On the"" Exchange-priced products"", the consensus was to use the prices published for first trading day that the Exchange reopens and  trades as the surrogate price for each day in the month that had no Exchange price reported....thus, using a full month in the calculations of monthly average prices.  As you know the vast majority of our natural gas contracts refer to the last three days of the NYMEX trading or the final day. Thus, again Enron's exposure would be relatively low so long as the exchange opens before these critical dates.  The forwarded document indicates that NYMEX is apparently planning to do this as well; however, it could be written more clearly.   Lastly, at the conclusion of our t con with John Wilson we were told by him that the new general counsel of IDA held a conference call today.Unfortunately no one in the legal department was aware of the call so as to participate. Sara agreed that she would call her tomorrow to see what occurred.

Is this in lieu of or in addition to the Premium payment called for in paragraph (d)?  I think it works  only if the Premium payment made two days following execution of the Confirmation was made by Counterparty to EES (the Floating Amount Payor) and  the payment in (d) is intended to be a refund of the Premium back to Counterparty by EES.    (2) Paragraph (d) makes reference to the higher of ""two Cash Settlement Amount Calculations.""   There appears to be only one Cash Settlement Amount  calculation (an option versus eg. a swap).  Is ""Cash Settlement Amount"" intended to include the Premium?   (3) I think the proviso at the end of paragraph (b) applies to paragraph (d) as well (and to the entire Confirmation) and perhaps should come after (d).    The comments in the Fallback Methodolody section reflect my suggestions as well as my understanding of the mechanics  of that section.   Also, to make the document easier to review, and because it is the most likely scenario, the revised draft assumes EES is the seller of the option (i.e. the Floating Amount Payer), and our Customer the buyer of the option (Fixed Amount Payer).

"I was so lucky.  I took the 10:00 train from paddington (which by the way is fabulous) and got to the terminal at 10:10.  Security guards were making everyone leave the terminal unless their flight left before noon - the rule was that you could not come into the terminal until 2 hours before flight time ( this is of course different than the Virgin Atlantic pre recorded message which said to get to the airport 3 hours early).  Everyone was being herded outside the terminal - for security reasons they didn't want so many people in the terminal.  People were sitting on their suitcases in  a grassy area and someone said buses were moving people to offsite loacations to wait.   I asked the Virgin rep and she said that only the people holding tkts with a 9/16th flight date were allowed to line up to check in and everyone else had to go to a separate stand by line  - and by the way this line stretched around the world.  They were massively overbooked and she said only the ticketed passengers would get on.  I just happened to be standing next to a guy who also had a tkt on Continental/Virgin for the same flight - he said that he had talked to Continental in the US and they told him to go first to the continental counter and get reticketed.  So he and I went to t he Continental counter ( where they were giving out cookies!) and got reticketed for the 16th.  I never would have known to go to the countinental counter if I hadn't talked to him.  By then it was about 11:30 - so we sneaked back into the Virgin Atlantic line and and hour later we were processed in.  It was just too lucky.  I felt awful though - some of the people in the standby line were crying - they looked just desperate to get to the US.  We waited on the ground for 2 hours and then left the gate at about 4.

"I'm surprised that under the circumstances American won't just do it.  Linda and I both had to reschedule our flights and did it directly with the airline (Continental for me and Virgin for Linda).  Of course, in our cases the original flights were cancelled.  I don't have the Cunard reservations number here and haven't been able to access the web site this afternoon.  I will get it for you when I get home.  The fax number for the guest relations department is (305)463-3030.  In a sense I felt safer in London than here.  Once we got off the QE2 we weren't doing anything that would have made us attractive targets and I don't anticipate attacks against individual Americans overseas -- at least not outside of Muslim countries.  While there was an increase in police presence around town, we didn't hear of any actual threats to Americans while we were in London.  Airport security has been better there than here for a long time and now has been beefed up even further.  The Europeans just have more recent experience at dealing with terrorists than we do.  The sword rattling doesn't bother me too much.  I've been overseas during some tense international times before and as long as you're in a friendly country it shouldn't be an issue.  On the other hand, it REALLY feels good to be home and I can sure understand your wanting to have her with you.  From her point of view, I think that while the Brits were all being very sympathetic and supportive, the tragedy just isn't as immediate there and so the impact on Amanda has been somewhat less than if we had been home.  Given that, I think she doesn't want to waste this opportunity to do something fun in Europe while she has the chance and is already over there.  For me I have to say it was hard to have any fun after Tuesday noon, although I tried to put a good face on it.  I don't know when that will improve since I'm still pretty depressed.  It's probably even worse for you since you were so much closer to things than I am.  The lawyer in me sees two sides: (a) a trip to Paris is just the thing to take your mind off of events and (b) why waste a week of vacation and travel hassles when you aren't going to have a good time no matter where you go.

"Thanks for your thoughts Mark.  I may call you as well.  I think we have it worked out.  I was able to change the return flight to tomorrow.  I am working on putting together a quick trip out West as a consolation for Amanda.  She always wanted to see Grand Canyon.  I know that pales in comparison to a Paris cafe but it will have to do for now.  I am generally dismissive of the risks of travelling but this event has affected me deeply. And I think you are right that Amanda hasn't felt that yet.  I would love to ignore it or downplay it but I can't.  Do you know of any spa/resort type places in the Southwest that would meet the Hayman standard?  (I know you know what I mean by the Hayman standard).

"Looks good to me.  One remaining concern is that section (d) may not provide much protection.  According to the power trading lawyers who have worked with the FERC in the past, they never provide protection for what we would consider confidential commercial information even when they have the authority to do so.  If we want that kind of protection, it should be mandated, not made possible by regulatory action.  I'm not necessarily recommending a change, I just don't want anyone to be taking any comfort from section (d).   -----Original Message----- From:  Yoho, Lisa   Sent: Monday, September 17, 2001 11:37 AM To: Taylor, Mark E (Legal) Subject: FW: Transparency language  This is the language that I referred to in my email.

Per our conversation last Friday we had discussed that you would coordinate with the other lawyers to review the top 20 list and draft amendments for using CommodityLogic's ConfirmLogic module for the purpose of confirmations.    The marketing team's goal for the timetable is to identify when the amendment can be ready for delivery to the customer.  Marketing will coordinate the actual delivery of the amendments to the customers at the appropriate time during the sales cycle.  Just to restate Tom Gros' goal, he would like the amendments to be drafted and ready to go so there will be no delays when the sales team reaches the point in the sales cycle to provide the documents to the customer.  The sales team's immediate focus is on the top 10 customers on this list and the amendments will need to be made available within the next couple of weeks for presenting to the customers.  If you could provide Jennifer, Kim and myself with your timetable that will help us set expectations with the sales team.  Jennifer will follow up with you on a weekly basis to get from you a status/update on the timetable to be incorporated in a marketing status report to Enron Networks senior management team.

"While I think the law actually works that way, we have avoided putting it in writing so far.  The way the web site works, the decision to accept or reject the offer happens almost instantaneously so the question is almost meaningless.  The time we care is when the internet slows down or the connection goes down and they don't see that we accepted their offer and then they try to get out.  I guess the other question would be how do they withdraw the offer?  The website doesn't provide a mechanism for that.  If we say it has to be in writing and delivered to the relevant trader, in practice it might not be an issue.   -----Original Message----- From:  Boomer, John   Sent: Thursday, September 20, 2001 3:46 PM To: Taylor, Mark E (Legal) Subject: Coal Purchases Online  Mark:  We met briefly about 2 months ago when I interviewed here.

While I was learning, written guidelines would have been helpful. So I've written some to assist others.  1.  Know the state casserole.  The state casserole consists of canned green beans, Campbell's cream of mushroom soup and dried onions. You can safely  take this casserole to any social event and know that you will be accepted.   In fact, Neil Armstrong almost took this casserole to the moon in case he encountered alien life there.  NASA nixed the plan out of concern that the casserole would overburden the Apollo rocket at liftoff.  2.  Get used to food festivals.  The Ohio General Assembly, in an effort to  grow bigger offensive linemen, passed legislation years ago requiring every  incorporated community to have at least one festival per year dedicated to  a  high-fat food.  Thus, Sugarcreek honors Swiss cheese, Bucyrus  has a bratwurst celebration and Gahanna, seeking an edge over other towns, has recently introduced the Triglyceride and Low-density Lipoprotein Festival.   It is your duty as an Ohioan to attend these festivals and at least buy an elephant ear.  3.  Know the geography.  Of Florida, I mean.  I've run into Ohioans who couldn't tell you where Toledo is but they know the exact distance from Fort Myers to Bonita Springs. That's because all Ohioans go to Florida in the winter.  Or plan to when they retire.  Or are related to retired Ohioans who have a place in Sarasota.  We consider Florida to be the Lower Peninsula of Ohio.  4.  If you can't afford to spend the winter in Florida, use the state excuse, which is that you stay here because you like the change of seasons.  You'll  be lying, but that's OK.  We've all done it.  5.  Speaking of Ohio weather, wear layers or die.  The thing to remember about Ohio seasons is that they can occur at anytime.  We have springlike days in January and wintry weekends in October. April is capable  of providing a sampling of all four seasons in a single 24-hour period. For these reasons, Ohio is the Layering Capital of the World. Even layering, however, can pose danger.  Golfers have been known to dress for hypothermia  and end up dead of heat stroke because they couldn't strip off their layers of plaid fast enough on a changeable spring morning.  6.  Don's take Ohio place names literally.  Upper Sandusky is below regular Sandusky.  Circleville is square.  East Liverpool has no counterpart to the west.  Also, if a town has the same name as a foreign capital.....Lima or Berlin, for example......you must not pronounce it that way lest you come under suspicion as a spy.  Hence, it's not LEE-ma as in Peru, but LYE-ma as in bean, and it's BER~lin, not BerLIN, like in Germany.  7.  Become mulch literate.  Ohioans love mulch and appreciate its subtle differences.  Learn the difference between hardwood, cypress and pine bark at  a minimum. Researchers think the state affinity for mulch derives from its relatively flat terrain.  People have a subconscious need for topography,  and when it can't be supplied naturally, they are more likely to make little mulch hillocks in their front yards.  8.  In order to talk sports with obsessive fans in Ohio, you have to be knowledgeable on three levels-professional, college and high school. The truly expert Ohio sports fan knows not only the name of the hotshot quarterback at Abercrombie and Fitch High School, but also what colleges he's interested in, how much he bench-presses, who he took to the prom and what he got on his biology quiz last week.  9.  Remember that Ohioans are never the first to embrace trends. When we do embrace them, we do so with a Midwestern pragmatism. For example, if you see an Ohioan with a nose ring, there's a good chance he's had it undercoated  to guard against rust.  10.  The best way to sell something in Ohio is to attach the term ""Amish"" to  it.  The product need not be genuinely Amish.  This would explain the existence of Amish moo shu pork.  I hope you found this guide to be useful.  If it offends you, please let me know and I will bring green bean casserole to your home to make amends.    - Linda Hayman.vcf ",mzeleanor@juno.com,legal <.taylor@enron.com>,FW: OHIOAN,2001-09-24 07:32:12-07:00,sent

Chris Balmer, Pam  Jaynes, and I will be giving you a call on Tuesday to discuss LG&E's  hedging plan, seek your comments, and address any issues or concerns you  may have in advance of actually sending out the bid letters.  We believe it  will be useful to seek your input and answer any questions you may have at  this point, since once regulatory approval is received the time to implement the  program, seek bids, and consummate transactions will all have very short turn  around times.

We added some additional points as we realized might be interesting to discuss:  I. ISDA Master Agreement and International Market Practice x Local Masters and Brazilian Market Practices  a) Differences as to events of default, early termination, suspension of contracts or valuations, etc. due to differences in market practices - discussion of contrasts;  b) Definitions of events of default and early termination and reflex in other local primary market agreements (loans, derivatives) - preparation for trigger events of credit derivatives.  c) Should the master agreement be recognized by the authorities as an official way to negotiate derivatives (ie. By creating a special regulatory treatment, etc.) or should it be used voluntarily by market participants as currently assumed?  II. ISDA Definitions of local rates, indexes, commodities, securities: liquidity of local and international derivatives market referenced to Brazilian financial instruments.  a) Contribution of ISDA to the negotiation of derivatives referenced to Brazilian instruments. b) Contribution of the authorities (ie. expansion of the scope to the negotiation of international hedging derivatives by Brazilian banks and counterparties).  III. Netting and Banking Credit Bills (c?dulas de cr?dito banc?rio).  a)   Instability of Provisional Measure x Contractual Reliability      -    power of law x  weakness of legislative trust      -    stability of contractual relations x change in law  b)   Negotiations of legislative approvals  c)            Independence of the Brazilian Central Bank and Monetary Council  Parallel in other legislation x benefits to the market x constraints to the market  IV. OTC Derivatives x Clearings  a)   Should all OTC Derivatives be registered in local clearances as the authorities require ?       -    pros and cos  b)   Tax effects and gambling characterization of unregistered contracts ?  V.

However, isn't this only the tip of the iceberg?  What about non-EOL OTC trades conducted by ECTRIC traders with counterparties that want ENA as their counterparty.  From my time in London, it was always impressed upon me that there was a quagmire of additional tax and potential regulatory (SFA) issues.  Please comment.  Also, as a commercially efficient course of action, It has always seemed to me that we should attempt to ""train"" our couterparties to accept that ECTRIC is also a Enron Corp guaranteed sub (at least it was in the past, at their request) and somehow initially set up our contracts/ISDA to be inclusive of this vehicle.  Is this possible?  Otherwise, the permutations of various legal/credit/tax/regulatory hurdles for all manner of OTC trades becomes onerous.

C/P trades via EOL with ECTRIC 2. Each trade is novated from ECTRIC to ENA, and treated as concluded under ENA ISDA Master 3. ENA enters into back-to-back trade with ECTRIC  This does mean that the C/P must initially accept the European EOL GTCs, though if we set up a mechanism whereby EOL trades are automatically novated to ENA and treated as concluded under the ENA ISDA Master, this effectively cancels out the EOL GTCs.

Cc: Abramo, Caroline; Zivic, Robyn; Diamond, Daniel; Radous, Paul; Lebrocq, Wendi; Sharma, Shifali Subject: FW: Trades as ENA  Everyone -  Our hedge fund group needs clarification on the issue of doing Brent and other European product deals w/ our hedge fund counterparties and booking them back to ENA, the entity with which all the funds have ISDAs. We just did two WTI/Brent crude oil spreads today, one w/ very large volume, and expect to be doing more such deals.   This is more than just a legal issue; it's going to impact credit and our strategy to get the funds trading on EOL as well.  As we understand it, the main legal issue is that all the funds have an ISDA only w/ ENA and not w/ ECTRIC, so they (and I assume we) want all deals and legal exposure to be w/ ENA. To satisfy both parties' desires, all European product deals must be booked from ECTRIC to ENA. Sara, from speaking to you and from Justin's response below, it seems to me that the only legal hurdle we, the funds, and our traders might face is if no trader w/ ENA in Houston okays w/ the counterparty on ENA's behalf. However, there seem to be 2 other solutions (a netting agreement and novating) that get around this. As Sara knows, dealing on legal agreements w/ the funds can be onerous and time-consuming; negotiating more paperwork is not a viable option.  From the credit side, as we understand it, the issue w/ not back-to-backing the trades w/ ENA is that the credit exposure will not be aggregated to the funds' net position in Houston and, therefore, not monitored. In other words, any exposure not sitting w/ ENA will be invisible to credit. so daily margining, etc. will  be incorrect.   From the EnronOnline side, as we see it there are a couple of issues. EOL wants the funds to trade online; an increasing number of funds also want to trade online. However, they do not want to be restricted to trading products that are only US based. Also, they would like to see more arb spread products like a WTI/Brent crude oil spread online. If neither desire can be easily met b/c we need a separate ISDA w/ ECTRIC (which potentially means, as above, more onerous and time-consuming negotiation), then it will certainly be detrimental for volume and also foresake a certain momentum that we are gaining now.   The point has been raised that the funds could trade European products if credit in London cleared them and if they were willing then to accept the general terms and conditions that pop up on EOL. We can assure you that they will not accept this.  These are the issues as we see them from the origination side. There may be other issues that we're missing from the sides that I've mentioned as well as the trading/back office side.

The current approach is the right one in the circumstances - i.e trade between ECTRIC and ENA, trade between ENA and third party (eg Bank of America). It is important that the trader agreeing to the deal with the third party in the name of ENA is located in Houston (they cannot agree deals in the name of ENA when located in London).  The pricing should be such that ENA is compensated for taking the credit risk with respect to the third party but otherwise all the economics should be with ECTRIC.   To avoid booking the back to back trades, a possibility would be an agreement on netting to be entered into by ECTRIC, ENA and Bank of America if all parties can get comfortable with the legal position.  Another alternative sometimes put forward is that ECTRIC does the deal with Bank of America, the contract is then novated from ECTRIC to ENA, and ENA enters into a back to back swap on the same financial terms with ECTRIC.  Note that we are currently working on a project to enter into financials through EFET LLC (arranged by EEFT) instead of ECTRIC (effective 1 November).

At the moment we have a number of counterparties who do not want to transact with ECTRIC but would like to do deals only with ENA (e.g. Bank of America). As a result, if a London trader wants to carry out a trade with Bank of America, he will do an internal trade with a trader in Houston and then book a trade between the Houston trader (who trades under ENA) and Bank Of America. The trades are then confirmed from the Houston office.  We were wondering about a couple of things:  Are there any tax/legal implications we should be aware of as a result of booking the trades as we do Is there a way to approach these counterparties to get them to trade with ECTRIC (as this currently creates a lot of paperwork and administration)?

"Thanks Vela.  My office address is fine.  Just so you know ahead of time what some of my questions will be:  1.  I'm a little concerned about the safety of in-mast furling systems generally.  What happens if it jams in a blow? 2.  Are the heads both electric?  Will they operate manually if you lose power? 3.  The boat seems remarkably well equipped.  What sorts of additional items are usual to purchase before she's ready to cruise? 4.  How do U.S. owners deal with the voltage issues and electrical repairs and replacements? 5.  Finally, and I suppose of least importance, I'm not thrilled with the teak-look deck or the blue cabin sole.  Any hope of a manufacturing change?

In FORTUNE's annual survey of the 50 Most Powerful Women in  Busine= ss, we see the emergence of women who came to power slowly.

Last  year,=  power resided in the technology and Internet sectors, but that  influence = was fleeting. Gone from the list this year: ""Hurricane Debby""  Hopkins, who=  pushed her agenda too ambitiously at Lucent and lost her  CFO job in May; = Ellen Hancock, who failed at the startup Exodus; and  Morgan Stanley's Mary=  Meeker, who influenced so many to buy into the  Internet fizz.

Wh= itman, who at times took heat for not  managing aggressively enough, has ne= ver overpromised investors; instead  she has diligently delivered above-tar= get profits every single  quarter. While the economy and its points of power change, the definition we use  to=  evaluate power remains the same.

She heads a healthy busin= ess, ad giant Ogilvy & Mather (where,  by the way, she has worked for 30 ye= ars), whose revenues grew 20% last  year. Plus, she added a prestigious boa= rd seat--General Electric--to her  resume. But in order to make room for ne= wcomers, Lazarus slides to No.  11, from No. 7 last year.=20 One newcomer is Southwest Airlines President Colleen Barrett (No. 20).  Loy= alty and self-knowledge took Barrett to corporate heights she never  imagin= ed while growing up in tiny Bellows Falls, Vt.  Barrett couldn't  afford to=  go to a four-year college and had no specific ambition beyond  believing s= he ""would be the best legal secretary in the world,"" she  says.

""I've never wanted the CEO job,"" says Barrett. ""I don= 't think I have the  talents for it. I'm a great No. 2 person."" Now 57, Bar= rett is exactly  where she wants to be. =20 Loyalty does not mean kowtowing. The women on our list push their  companie= s to change and grow, and they take personal risks. ""Women have  to take a = lot of risks because there is no natural career progression,""  says Mirant = CEO Marce Fuller. She should know. Fuller was getting great  marks running = international project development for Mirant's former  parent, Southern, in=  1994, when her boss asked her to take charge of the  company's tiny North = American power plant operations. After looking  closely at the business, sh= e told her boss she didn't want the job  unless she could do something alto= gether new--build a high-tech  risk-management and marketing organization t= o complement the expansion  of power plants in the U.S. ""I told him, 'If yo= u don't have this piece,  you don't have a game plan,' "" she says.

Once she got  it, she built a 600-person energy trading and market= ing unit that is  expected to generate $25 billion in revenues this year. S= outhern, a  regulated utility, spun off Mirant last spring. So now Fuller i= s her own  boss--and, with Mirant sure to be among America's largest compan= ies this  year, a FORTUNE 500 CEO.=20 One of the few. The grim news is that there are only six women CEOs of  FOR= TUNE 500 companies, including Fuller. And there are fewer women in  the pip= eline than anyone would have thought 30 years ago.

Of course, in the U.S. they are probably required by the SEC and in a country where they are not required you have to wonder how well the brokers are being policed by regulators.

I don't think we need written opinions of counsel.  It might also make sense to explain to the business folks that we think there is incrementally greater legal risk in using those arrangements and that while they may be permitted to use them they should keep activities to a minimum where there is a more secure alternative.

The boat seems remarkably well equipped.  What sorts of additional items are usual to purchase before she's ready to cruise? 4.  How do U.S. owners deal with the voltage issues and electrical repairs and replacements? 5.

"Mark -  Just a few quick notes from yesterday's staff meeting (items you should know about):  Enron Direct - Appears to be really ramping up.   Currently using TaletTree and Saliens (sp?) (temp/consulting agencies) for sales personnel to lower end of mkt.   Goal by 10/15 to have all commodity/tariff curves in EES database   Looking to also load customer profile information for approx. 22K customers   In sync with Canadian efforts and looking at Toronto as a bigger mkt than Calgary  Beth pointed out Corp. contractual commitment to Ernst & Young of $60MM annually and suggestion to consider them for consulting services.  Currently Corp. spend is approx. $40MM annually.  Pipeling software products -  Have contract with Luminent for marketing     Enron gets 100% of license fees and continues to own products (including all enhancements)     Luminent gets opportunity to do all integration     Product price is $500,000  Jay indicated Kiodex transaction data fee is up and ready for operation.  Waiting for Kiodex to be ready to go live.  The Kiodex product will appear as a ""Risk Report"" button inside of EOL.  Mention was made of the ""layoffs"" in Europe, but Greg indicated it may not be much of an impact on ENW personnel presuming the level of support for existing businesses remains constant.  Nothing else in particular was discussed.  Tom and I did have an opportunity to speak about some CommodityLogic items subsequent to the staff meeting.  His big concern remains the speed with which we are able to produce amendment documents for counterparties, especially in light of the fact that Greg now wants weekly reports on the progress of these amendments - from Tom.  I worked with Brent, Bob and Kathryn Cordes yesterday on a possible short term solution that may at least enable the CommodityLogic marketing personnel to put a base amendment form (not to be signed) in front of counterparties.  The base amendment form would clearly indicate that additional information was necessary before an agreement was reached.  This would be followed up by the actual ""guts"" of the legal confirm language.  Please let me know if you have any questions or need anything else.

"                   ANNOUNCING THE EVENT NOTIFICATION SYSTEM   Because we have your e-mail address, we are TESTING a system which offers you the opportunity to receive automatic e-mail notification of certain events taking place in your 5th Circuit appeals. In brief, we send you an e-mail notifying you when we:          1. Issue a briefing notice;         2. File and rule on motions to extend the time to file a brief, or to         suspend briefing times;         3. File briefs;         4. File and act on a petition for rehearing.  You can see a complete listing of the notification events by clicking on the link below.            http://www.ca5.uscourts.gov/attyemail/eventlist.htm                      What does the notice look like?  You receive the publicly available docket text for these events from our automated case processing system. You can see a sample by clicking on the link below. This is the ONLY information you receive. You still have to access PACERNET to view the entire docket sheet. For those events where we normally send you a paper document, e.g. a briefing notice, you will still receive that paper notice.                      What is the benefit to me?  You will save time and money by not having to check your case's status on PACERNET, and will not have to call our office to see if we have filed your or your opponent's brief, to find out when your briefing time begins to run, or if a rehearing petition has been filed, etc. This service is designed to benefit you and our office. If however, we find that we are expending more resources by operating the event notification system because we receive more telephone calls or electronic messages etc. we will discontinue the service.              How much does the event notification service cost? The service is free.                      How do I sign up for the service?  You must:          1. Be a member of the 5th Circuit Bar;         2. Have provided us your current e-mail address;         3. Sign up by clicking on the  link below and filling out the required information, or by going to our website http://www.ca5.uscourts.gov and clicking on the ""event notification"" link. Note, that you can elect to start the service now, delay receiving the service, but be left on our invitation list, or elect not to participate and be removed from our invitation list. You can also change your e-mail address and this will change it throughout our automated system.            http://www.ca5.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/email.exe?prid=38379                      What if I want to stop the service?  You can discontinue the service at any time by selecting the ""event notification link"" or our ""website"", entering your social security number and then selecting the either of the options that de-register you from the service.                      What if the court needs to stop the service?  This is a test service. If we find that running the event notification program strains our limited resources, we may terminate the test.

"Item 1.  Please refer to Section 7, particularly 7(b), of the ISDA form reg= arding transfer of receivables and the following setoff language from our s= chedule.  (g)=09Setoff.  (A) Upon the designation or deemed designation of an Early T= ermination Date the Non-defaulting Party or the non-Affected Party (in eith= er case, ""X"") may, at its option and in its discretion, setoff, against any=  amounts Owed to the Defaulting Party or Affected Party (in either case, ""Y= "") in Dollars or any other currency by X or any Affiliate of X under this A= greement or under any other agreement(s), instrument(s) or undertaking(s), = any amounts Owed in Dollars or any other currency by Y to X or any of X's A= ffiliates (irrespective of place of payment or booking office of the obliga= tion) under this Agreement or under any other agreement(s), instrument(s) o= r undertaking(s).  The obligations of Y and X under this Agreement in respe= ct of such amounts shall be deemed satisfied and discharged to the extent o= f any such setoff exercised by X and/or X's Affiliates.  X will give Y noti= ce of any setoff effected under this Section as soon as practicable after t= he setoff is effected provided that failure to give such notice shall not a= ffect the validity of the setoff.  For purposes of this Section, ""Owed"" sha= ll mean any amounts owed or otherwise accrued and payable (regardless of wh= ether such amounts have been or could be invoiced) as of the Early Terminat= ion Date. Amounts subject to the setoff permitted in this Section may be converted by=  X into any currency in which any obligation Owed is denominated at the rat= e of exchange at which X, acting in a reasonable manner and in good faith, = would be able to purchase the relevant amount of the currency being convert= ed.  If an obligation is unascertained, X may in good faith estimate that o= bligation and setoff in respect of the estimate, subject to the relevant pa= rty accounting to the other when the obligation is ascertained.  Nothing in=  this Section shall be effective to create a charge or other security inter= est except as may be provided under applicable law.  This setoff provision = shall be without limitation and in addition to any right of setoff, netting= , offset, combination of accounts, counterclaim, lien or other right to whi= ch X or any of X's Affiliates is at any time otherwise entitled (whether by=  operation of law, contract or otherwise).  Each of the parties represents = and acknowledges that the rights set forth in this Section are an integral = part of this Agreement between the parties and that without such rights the=  parties would not be willing to enter into Transactions.  Each of the part= ies further acknowledges that it is executing this Agreement on behalf of i= tself as principal and, with respect to this Section, as agent on behalf of=  its Affiliates, which Affiliates shall receive the benefits of this Sectio= n and otherwise be bound as if such Affiliates had directly signed this Agr= eement as it relates to this Section. (B) Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained in this Agreeme= nt, the Non-defaulting Party or non-Affected Party, as the case may be, sha= ll not be required to pay to the Defaulting Party or Affected Party any amo= unt under Section 6(e) until the Non-defaulting Party or non-Affected Party=  receives confirmation satisfactory to it in its reasonable discretion (whi= ch may include an opinion of its counsel) that all other obligations of any=  kind whatsoever (whether pursuant to Specified Indebtedness as defined her= ein or otherwise) of the Defaulting Party or Affected Party to make any pay= ments to the Non-defaulting Party or non-Affected Party or any of its Affil= iates under this Agreement or under any other agreement(s), instrument(s) o= r undertaking(s), which are Owed as of the Early Termination Date hereof ha= ve been fully and finally satisfied.  The following are three areas of questions.  A.  Should a Counterparty effect an assignment of receivables under Section=  7(b) for a financing to Bank, what is Enron's ""priority"" position (assumin= g Bank has filed a financing statement)?  Is the analysis below correct?  1.  Bank takes receivable assignment under contract subject to Enron setoff=  rights because Bank would be held to actual knowledge of the express setof= f right in the contract under which it is taking the receivables.=20  2.  Is there any method by which the Bank can prime Enron (assuming Enron h= as made no public filings) without Enron's written consent? =20 B.  Assume a master netting agreement is in place.  I believe our assignmen= t provisions protect us and are more prohibitive than the ISDA; however, we=  may want to expressly cite assignment of receivables rather than the maste= r agreement and transactions ""as security"".

Please refer to Section 7, particularly 7(b), of the ISDA form reg= arding transfer of receivables and the following setoff language from our s= chedule.  (g)=09Setoff.  (A) Upon the designation or deemed designation of an Early T= ermination Date the Non-defaulting Party or the non-Affected Party (in eith= er case, ""X"") may, at its option and in its discretion, setoff, against any=  amounts Owed to the Defaulting Party or Affected Party (in either case, ""Y= "") in Dollars or any other currency by X or any Affiliate of X under this A= greement or under any other agreement(s), instrument(s) or undertaking(s), = any amounts Owed in Dollars or any other currency by Y to X or any of X's A= ffiliates (irrespective of place of payment or booking office of the obliga= tion) under this Agreement or under any other agreement(s), instrument(s) o= r undertaking(s).  The obligations of Y and X under this Agreement in respe= ct of such amounts shall be deemed satisfied and discharged to the extent o= f any such setoff exercised by X and/or X's Affiliates.  X will give Y noti= ce of any setoff effected under this Section as soon as practicable after t= he setoff is effected provided that failure to give such notice shall not a= ffect the validity of the setoff.  For purposes of this Section, ""Owed"" sha= ll mean any amounts owed or otherwise accrued and payable (regardless of wh= ether such amounts have been or could be invoiced) as of the Early Terminat= ion Date. Amounts subject to the setoff permitted in this Section may be converted by=  X into any currency in which any obligation Owed is denominated at the rat= e of exchange at which X, acting in a reasonable manner and in good faith, = would be able to purchase the relevant amount of the currency being convert= ed.  If an obligation is unascertained, X may in good faith estimate that o= bligation and setoff in respect of the estimate, subject to the relevant pa= rty accounting to the other when the obligation is ascertained.  Nothing in=  this Section shall be effective to create a charge or other security inter= est except as may be provided under applicable law.  This setoff provision = shall be without limitation and in addition to any right of setoff, netting= , offset, combination of accounts, counterclaim, lien or other right to whi= ch X or any of X's Affiliates is at any time otherwise entitled (whether by=  operation of law, contract or otherwise).  Each of the parties represents = and acknowledges that the rights set forth in this Section are an integral = part of this Agreement between the parties and that without such rights the=  parties would not be willing to enter into Transactions.  Each of the part= ies further acknowledges that it is executing this Agreement on behalf of i= tself as principal and, with respect to this Section, as agent on behalf of=  its Affiliates, which Affiliates shall receive the benefits of this Sectio= n and otherwise be bound as if such Affiliates had directly signed this Agr= eement as it relates to this Section. (B) Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained in this Agreeme= nt, the Non-defaulting Party or non-Affected Party, as the case may be, sha= ll not be required to pay to the Defaulting Party or Affected Party any amo= unt under Section 6(e) until the Non-defaulting Party or non-Affected Party=  receives confirmation satisfactory to it in its reasonable discretion (whi= ch may include an opinion of its counsel) that all other obligations of any=  kind whatsoever (whether pursuant to Specified Indebtedness as defined her= ein or otherwise) of the Defaulting Party or Affected Party to make any pay= ments to the Non-defaulting Party or non-Affected Party or any of its Affil= iates under this Agreement or under any other agreement(s), instrument(s) o= r undertaking(s), which are Owed as of the Early Termination Date hereof ha= ve been fully and finally satisfied.  The following are three areas of questions.  A.  Should a Counterparty effect an assignment of receivables under Section=  7(b) for a financing to Bank, what is Enron's ""priority"" position (assumin= g Bank has filed a financing statement)?  Is the analysis below correct?  1.  Bank takes receivable assignment under contract subject to Enron setoff=  rights because Bank would be held to actual knowledge of the express setof= f right in the contract under which it is taking the receivables.=20  2.  Is there any method by which the Bank can prime Enron (assuming Enron h= as made no public filings) without Enron's written consent? =20 B.  Assume a master netting agreement is in place.  I believe our assignmen= t provisions protect us and are more prohibitive than the ISDA; however, we=  may want to expressly cite assignment of receivables rather than the maste= r agreement and transactions ""as security"".  Please review and advise of an= y particular language you think should be added. =20  C.  Do you have any suggested language that we might add to the form 7(b) p= rovision via our schedule, or is it necessary?   For example, adding at the=  end of 7(b), "";provided, any such assignment shall be made expressly subje= ct [and subordinate] to this Agreement, including, without limitation, all = rights of [ENA] under Section 6 and [reference setoff section].""

"To the extent you need my authorization or approval regarding the trading database, you've got it.  If you have any questions, Tana can probably help.   -----Original Message----- From:  Greenberg, Mark   Sent: Wednesday, October 17, 2001 5:50 PM To: Wong, Joe Cc: Haedicke, Mark E.; Taylor, Mark E (Legal); Sager, Elizabeth; Hodge, Jeffrey T.; Murray, Julia; Tweed, Sheila; Schuler, Lance (Legal) Subject: RE: 2002 IT Budgets  Joe -  Thanks for the information.  As I told Cornelio in relation to the EWS - Legal Project, I am currently only responsible for the LegalOnline project and work on this under the authority of Mark Haedicke.  As to the other projects, why and how may name became associated with them is both interesting and incorrect as I am not the ""sponsor"" of any of them.  Last week I received the first indication of the need to discuss these projects in line with ENW's budget approval for ENA projects.  Since a conference call was scheduled for earlier today to discuss these items, I figured I would gather more information and forward that information to the appropriate member of the Dept. for review, consideration and action.  I was advised yesterday that the budget was approved and there was no need for today's conference call.  Despite this budget approval (without EWS Legal discussion), ENW personnel have continued to request that I ""approve"" these projects for next year - even if the approval is only as a ""placeholder"" for the budget.  I cannot do this and, quite frankly, see no value in obtaining these ""approvals"" if the budget has been approved.  If those responsible for these other projects would like me to follow-up with you on these matters and authorize me to do so, I would be more than happy to do so.  Sheila Tweed has actually asked me to do this on the ""extranet"" project, which I will be reviewing with Ed Hearn.  Once we (Ed and I) have reviewed the feasibility study proposed by Cornelio, we will determine the next steps to be taken and whether or not this project should move forward.  I will advise you accordingly.  Mark       -----Original Message----- From:  Wong, Joe   Sent: Wednesday, October 17, 2001 12:40 PM To: Greenberg, Mark Subject: 2002 IT Budgets  Mark - these are the answers to your questions concerning our budgets.  Please let me know if this is OK with you.  I would be happy to discuss in person or via a phone call.  Let me know what's best for you.  Your name appearing on 2 projects for ENA?   1)  ""EWS - Legal"" project. -  Cornelio spoke with you last night and confirmed 1 project actually belongs to Sheila Tweed.  So we will get her to approve.  2)  ""Legal Web Maint.""  - this is really 3 projects, which are: Legal Web - Enhancements/maintenance for 2001 project converting ""ECT Legal Foreign & Domestic"", ""Jurisdiction Document Library"", and ""European Document Libarary"" Notes applications to intranet apps.  Sponsored by Mark Greenberg. Physical and Financial Trading, Power Trading, Gas Assets and Industrial Markets Trading Agreements intranet site.  Replaces and expands 3 Master Agreements Notes applications.  Sponsored by Marc Taylor, Elizabeth Sager, Jeff Hodge, Julia Murray.   ENA Legal Support application. Sponsored by W.L. Schuler Can you informally approve these 3 projects?  Is this formal commitment to the projects? No.  This is only a placeholder in the budget for these projects, not formal approval.  You would formally approve the projects once we were ready to start working on them next year.  So, you can agree to put a placeholder in the budget for the project, but cancel it next year before we begin actually working on it.

I sent her an e-mail this morning trying to set up a call after the All Employee Meeting because I guessed that she had been looking at our issue from the London side.  She is going to call me at 4 p.m. Houston time this afternoon to discuss what she has found out to date.  Also, one of the attached e-mails suggests that all the London financially settled contracts will be entered into through EFET LLC (rather than ECTRIC) beginning 1 November.  I will confirm that with Janine when I talk with her this afternoon.  After reading the attached e-mail string, I still think it makes the most sense to have ENA enter into the transactions with the hedge funds (and thus have the transactions be entered into under the ENA ISDA).  This assumes, of course, that (1) the counterparties are US or Bermuda based hedge funds as we discussed yesterday, and (2) the New York or Houston office (rather than the London office) is executing and confirming these transactions.  We should confirm these assumptions with Robyn.  Do you see any reason why this approach would not work for non-EnronOnline transactions?  Also, based on the attached e-mail string, it looks like we're trying to set this up for both EnronOnline and  OTC contracts.  Were you aware of this?  I will give you a call shortly to discuss.

This seems like the simplest solution.  If not, I think we are back to the alternatives mentioned below.  With respect to the spread products I believe there are no spread books as such, each risk is laid off to the respective books. In this case, a good rule of thumb would be to have the spread product offered by ENA (thus it is ENA who contracts with the hedge fund) and then ENA lays off the relevant risk (in the WTI/Brent example ENA lays off Brent to ECTRIC). The only issue I see with this is offering the product when ENA is closed, as traders in London cannot act on behalf of ENA (or alternatively traders in Houston could work extended hours ?).  Russell, do the hedge funds operate only out of New York, or would they operate out of London or other European offices also ? I am just wondering how much of an issue the trading hours would be.  To clarify, using ENA as the contracting party for all global liquids products would risk exposing ENA to a UK tax presence (assuming that traders continue to be based in London). Since a significant proportion of Enron's total income is earned by ENA this would be an unacceptable risk (any UK tax paid cannot offset the US tax liability because of certain limitations that apply to Enron - thus most of the UK tax paid represents an additional cost).

However, isn't this only the tip of the iceberg?  What about non-EOL OTC trades conducted by ECTRIC traders with counterparties that want ENA as their counterparty.  From my time in London, it was always impressed upon me that there was a quagmire of additional tax and potential regulatory (SFA) issues.  Please comment.  Also, as a commercially efficient course of action, It has always seemed to me that we should attempt to ""train"" our couterparties to accept that ECTRIC is also a Enron Corp guaranteed sub (at least it was in the past, at their request) and somehow initially set up our contracts/ISDA to be inclusive of this vehicle.  Is this possible?  Otherwise, the permutations of various legal/credit/tax/regulatory hurdles for all manner of OTC trades becomes onerous.

C/P trades via EOL with ECTRIC 2. Each trade is novated from ECTRIC to ENA, and treated as concluded under ENA ISDA Master 3. ENA enters into back-to-back trade with ECTRIC  This does mean that the C/P must initially accept the European EOL GTCs, though if we set up a mechanism whereby EOL trades are automatically novated to ENA and treated as concluded under the ENA ISDA Master, this effectively cancels out the EOL GTCs.

Cc: Abramo, Caroline; Zivic, Robyn; Diamond, Daniel; Radous, Paul; Lebrocq, Wendi; Sharma, Shifali Subject: FW: Trades as ENA  Everyone -  Our hedge fund group needs clarification on the issue of doing Brent and other European product deals w/ our hedge fund counterparties and booking them back to ENA, the entity with which all the funds have ISDAs. We just did two WTI/Brent crude oil spreads today, one w/ very large volume, and expect to be doing more such deals.   This is more than just a legal issue; it's going to impact credit and our strategy to get the funds trading on EOL as well.  As we understand it, the main legal issue is that all the funds have an ISDA only w/ ENA and not w/ ECTRIC, so they (and I assume we) want all deals and legal exposure to be w/ ENA. To satisfy both parties' desires, all European product deals must be booked from ECTRIC to ENA. Sara, from speaking to you and from Justin's response below, it seems to me that the only legal hurdle we, the funds, and our traders might face is if no trader w/ ENA in Houston okays w/ the counterparty on ENA's behalf. However, there seem to be 2 other solutions (a netting agreement and novating) that get around this. As Sara knows, dealing on legal agreements w/ the funds can be onerous and time-consuming; negotiating more paperwork is not a viable option.  From the credit side, as we understand it, the issue w/ not back-to-backing the trades w/ ENA is that the credit exposure will not be aggregated to the funds' net position in Houston and, therefore, not monitored. In other words, any exposure not sitting w/ ENA will be invisible to credit. so daily margining, etc. will  be incorrect.   From the EnronOnline side, as we see it there are a couple of issues. EOL wants the funds to trade online; an increasing number of funds also want to trade online. However, they do not want to be restricted to trading products that are only US based. Also, they would like to see more arb spread products like a WTI/Brent crude oil spread online. If neither desire can be easily met b/c we need a separate ISDA w/ ECTRIC (which potentially means, as above, more onerous and time-consuming negotiation), then it will certainly be detrimental for volume and also foresake a certain momentum that we are gaining now.   The point has been raised that the funds could trade European products if credit in London cleared them and if they were willing then to accept the general terms and conditions that pop up on EOL. We can assure you that they will not accept this.  These are the issues as we see them from the origination side.

The current approach is the right one in the circumstances - i.e trade between ECTRIC and ENA, trade between ENA and third party (eg Bank of America). It is important that the trader agreeing to the deal with the third party in the name of ENA is located in Houston (they cannot agree deals in the name of ENA when located in London).  The pricing should be such that ENA is compensated for taking the credit risk with respect to the third party but otherwise all the economics should be with ECTRIC.   To avoid booking the back to back trades, a possibility would be an agreement on netting to be entered into by ECTRIC, ENA and Bank of America if all parties can get comfortable with the legal position.  Another alternative sometimes put forward is that ECTRIC does the deal with Bank of America, the contract is then novated from ECTRIC to ENA, and ENA enters into a back to back swap on the same financial terms with ECTRIC.

At the moment we have a number of counterparties who do not want to transact with ECTRIC but would like to do deals only with ENA (e.g. Bank of America). As a result, if a London trader wants to carry out a trade with Bank of America, he will do an internal trade with a trader in Houston and then book a trade between the Houston trader (who trades under ENA) and Bank Of America. The trades are then confirmed from the Houston office.  We were wondering about a couple of things:  Are there any tax/legal implications we should be aware of as a result of booking the trades as we do Is there a way to approach these counterparties to get them to trade with ECTRIC (as this currently creates a lot of paperwork and administration)?

"I agree with Susan that for non-EOL trades concluded by our traders in NYC and Houston that the ENA ISDA should be used.

I sent her an e-mail this morning trying to set up a call after the All Employee Meeting because I guessed that she had been looking at our issue from the London side.  She is going to call me at 4 p.m. Houston time this afternoon to discuss what she has found out to date.  Also, one of the attached e-mails suggests that all the London financially settled contracts will be entered into through EFET LLC (rather than ECTRIC) beginning 1 November.  I will confirm that with Janine when I talk with her this afternoon.  After reading the attached e-mail string, I still think it makes the most sense to have ENA enter into the transactions with the hedge funds (and thus have the transactions be entered into under the ENA ISDA).  This assumes, of course, that (1) the counterparties are US or Bermuda based hedge funds as we discussed yesterday, and (2) the New York or Houston office (rather than the London office) is executing and confirming these transactions.  We should confirm these assumptions with Robyn.  Do you see any reason why this approach would not work for non-EnronOnline transactions?  Also, based on the attached e-mail string, it looks like we're trying to set this up for both EnronOnline and  OTC contracts.  Were you aware of this?  I will give you a call shortly to discuss.

This seems like the simplest solution.  If not, I think we are back to the alternatives mentioned below.  With respect to the spread products I believe there are no spread books as such, each risk is laid off to the respective books. In this case, a good rule of thumb would be to have the spread product offered by ENA (thus it is ENA who contracts with the hedge fund) and then ENA lays off the relevant risk (in the WTI/Brent example ENA lays off Brent to ECTRIC). The only issue I see with this is offering the product when ENA is closed, as traders in London cannot act on behalf of ENA (or alternatively traders in Houston could work extended hours ?).  Russell, do the hedge funds operate only out of New York, or would they operate out of London or other European offices also ? I am just wondering how much of an issue the trading hours would be.  To clarify, using ENA as the contracting party for all global liquids products would risk exposing ENA to a UK tax presence (assuming that traders continue to be based in London). Since a significant proportion of Enron's total income is earned by ENA this would be an unacceptable risk (any UK tax paid cannot offset the US tax liability because of certain limitations that apply to Enron - thus most of the UK tax paid represents an additional cost).

However, isn't this only the tip of the iceberg?  What about non-EOL OTC trades conducted by ECTRIC traders with counterparties that want ENA as their counterparty.  From my time in London, it was always impressed upon me that there was a quagmire of additional tax and potential regulatory (SFA) issues.  Please comment.  Also, as a commercially efficient course of action, It has always seemed to me that we should attempt to ""train"" our couterparties to accept that ECTRIC is also a Enron Corp guaranteed sub (at least it was in the past, at their request) and somehow initially set up our contracts/ISDA to be inclusive of this vehicle.  Is this possible?  Otherwise, the permutations of various legal/credit/tax/regulatory hurdles for all manner of OTC trades becomes onerous.

C/P trades via EOL with ECTRIC 2. Each trade is novated from ECTRIC to ENA, and treated as concluded under ENA ISDA Master 3. ENA enters into back-to-back trade with ECTRIC  This does mean that the C/P must initially accept the European EOL GTCs, though if we set up a mechanism whereby EOL trades are automatically novated to ENA and treated as concluded under the ENA ISDA Master, this effectively cancels out the EOL GTCs.

Cc: Abramo, Caroline; Zivic, Robyn; Diamond, Daniel; Radous, Paul; Lebrocq, Wendi; Sharma, Shifali Subject: FW: Trades as ENA  Everyone -  Our hedge fund group needs clarification on the issue of doing Brent and other European product deals w/ our hedge fund counterparties and booking them back to ENA, the entity with which all the funds have ISDAs. We just did two WTI/Brent crude oil spreads today, one w/ very large volume, and expect to be doing more such deals.   This is more than just a legal issue; it's going to impact credit and our strategy to get the funds trading on EOL as well.  As we understand it, the main legal issue is that all the funds have an ISDA only w/ ENA and not w/ ECTRIC, so they (and I assume we) want all deals and legal exposure to be w/ ENA. To satisfy both parties' desires, all European product deals must be booked from ECTRIC to ENA. Sara, from speaking to you and from Justin's response below, it seems to me that the only legal hurdle we, the funds, and our traders might face is if no trader w/ ENA in Houston okays w/ the counterparty on ENA's behalf. However, there seem to be 2 other solutions (a netting agreement and novating) that get around this. As Sara knows, dealing on legal agreements w/ the funds can be onerous and time-consuming; negotiating more paperwork is not a viable option.  From the credit side, as we understand it, the issue w/ not back-to-backing the trades w/ ENA is that the credit exposure will not be aggregated to the funds' net position in Houston and, therefore, not monitored. In other words, any exposure not sitting w/ ENA will be invisible to credit. so daily margining, etc. will  be incorrect.   From the EnronOnline side, as we see it there are a couple of issues. EOL wants the funds to trade online; an increasing number of funds also want to trade online. However, they do not want to be restricted to trading products that are only US based. Also, they would like to see more arb spread products like a WTI/Brent crude oil spread online. If neither desire can be easily met b/c we need a separate ISDA w/ ECTRIC (which potentially means, as above, more onerous and time-consuming negotiation), then it will certainly be detrimental for volume and also foresake a certain momentum that we are gaining now.

OTC transactions will be arranged by originators in the New York office and booked in the name of ENA, and then a transaction will be entered into between ENA and the relevant Enron affiliate (eg ECTRIC) to transfer the economic position to the relevant Enron affiliate.  2. Online transactions - see Justin's mail below. The suggestion would be that the Hedge Fund does the trade on EOL with the relevant Enron affiliate (eg ECTRIC). The trade then gets novated from Enron affiliate to ENA. A transaction is then entered into between ENA and Enron affiliate to transfer the economic position. We'll need to work at documentation and process to make this as smooth as possible.

However, isn't this only the tip of the iceberg?  What about non-EOL OTC trades conducted by ECTRIC traders with counterparties that want ENA as their counterparty.  From my time in London, it was always impressed upon me that there was a quagmire of additional tax and potential regulatory (SFA) issues.  Please comment.  Also, as a commercially efficient course of action, It has always seemed to me that we should attempt to ""train"" our couterparties to accept that ECTRIC is also a Enron Corp guaranteed sub (at least it was in the past, at their request) and somehow initially set up our contracts/ISDA to be inclusive of this vehicle.  Is this possible?  Otherwise, the permutations of various legal/credit/tax/regulatory hurdles for all manner of OTC trades becomes onerous.

Cc: Abramo, Caroline; Zivic, Robyn; Diamond, Daniel; Radous, Paul; Lebrocq, Wendi; Sharma, Shifali; Juggins, Janine; Nelson, Roderick Subject: RE: Trades as ENA  Russell  My view would be to follow the novation route, i.e.   1. C/P trades via EOL with ECTRIC 2. Each trade is novated from ECTRIC to ENA, and treated as concluded under ENA ISDA Master 3. ENA enters into back-to-back trade with ECTRIC  This does mean that the C/P must initially accept the European EOL GTCs, though if we set up a mechanism whereby EOL trades are automatically novated to ENA and treated as concluded under the ENA ISDA Master, this effectively cancels out the EOL GTCs.  Justin   -----Original Message----- From:  Dyk, Russell   Sent: 27 September 2001 23:38 To: Shackleton, Sara; Boyd, Justin; White, Bill; Shankman, Jeffrey A. Cc: Abramo, Caroline; Zivic, Robyn; Diamond, Daniel; Radous, Paul; Lebrocq, Wendi; Sharma, Shifali Subject: FW: Trades as ENA  Everyone -  Our hedge fund group needs clarification on the issue of doing Brent and other European product deals w/ our hedge fund counterparties and booking them back to ENA, the entity with which all the funds have ISDAs. We just did two WTI/Brent crude oil spreads today, one w/ very large volume, and expect to be doing more such deals.   This is more than just a legal issue; it's going to impact credit and our strategy to get the funds trading on EOL as well.  As we understand it, the main legal issue is that all the funds have an ISDA only w/ ENA and not w/ ECTRIC, so they (and I assume we) want all deals and legal exposure to be w/ ENA. To satisfy both parties' desires, all European product deals must be booked from ECTRIC to ENA. Sara, from speaking to you and from Justin's response below, it seems to me that the only legal hurdle we, the funds, and our traders might face is if no trader w/ ENA in Houston okays w/ the counterparty on ENA's behalf. However, there seem to be 2 other solutions (a netting agreement and novating) that get around this. As Sara knows, dealing on legal agreements w/ the funds can be onerous and time-consuming; negotiating more paperwork is not a viable option.  From the credit side, as we understand it, the issue w/ not back-to-backing the trades w/ ENA is that the credit exposure will not be aggregated to the funds' net position in Houston and, therefore, not monitored. In other words, any exposure not sitting w/ ENA will be invisible to credit. so daily margining, etc. will  be incorrect.   From the EnronOnline side, as we see it there are a couple of issues. EOL wants the funds to trade online; an increasing number of funds also want to trade online. However, they do not want to be restricted to trading products that are only US based. Also, they would like to see more arb spread products like a WTI/Brent crude oil spread online. If neither desire can be easily met b/c we need a separate ISDA w/ ECTRIC (which potentially means, as above, more onerous and time-consuming negotiation), then it will certainly be detrimental for volume and also foresake a certain momentum that we are gaining now.   The point has been raised that the funds could trade European products if credit in London cleared them and if they were willing then to accept the general terms and conditions that pop up on EOL. We can assure you that they will not accept this.  These are the issues as we see them from the origination side. There may be other issues that we're missing from the sides that I've mentioned as well as the trading/back office side.

The current approach is the right one in the circumstances - i.e trade between ECTRIC and ENA, trade between ENA and third party (eg Bank of America). It is important that the trader agreeing to the deal with the third party in the name of ENA is located in Houston (they cannot agree deals in the name of ENA when located in London).  The pricing should be such that ENA is compensated for taking the credit risk with respect to the third party but otherwise all the economics should be with ECTRIC.   To avoid booking the back to back trades, a possibility would be an agreement on netting to be entered into by ECTRIC, ENA and Bank of America if all parties can get comfortable with the legal position.  Another alternative sometimes put forward is that ECTRIC does the deal with Bank of America, the contract is then novated from ECTRIC to ENA, and ENA enters into a back to back swap on the same financial terms with ECTRIC.  Note that we are currently working on a project to enter into financials through EFET LLC (arranged by EEFT) instead of ECTRIC (effective 1 November).

At the moment we have a number of counterparties who do not want to transact with ECTRIC but would like to do deals only with ENA (e.g. Bank of America). As a result, if a London trader wants to carry out a trade with Bank of America, he will do an internal trade with a trader in Houston and then book a trade between the Houston trader (who trades under ENA) and Bank Of America. The trades are then confirmed from the Houston office.  We were wondering about a couple of things:  Are there any tax/legal implications we should be aware of as a result of booking the trades as we do Is there a way to approach these counterparties to get them to trade with ECTRIC (as this currently creates a lot of paperwork and administration)?

OTC transactions will be arranged by originators in the New York office and booked in the name of ENA, and then a transaction will be entered into between ENA and the relevant Enron affiliate (eg ECTRIC) to transfer the economic position to the relevant Enron affiliate.  2. Online transactions - see Justin's mail below. The suggestion would be that the Hedge Fund does the trade on EOL with the relevant Enron affiliate (eg ECTRIC). The trade then gets novated from Enron affiliate to ENA. A transaction is then entered into between ENA and Enron affiliate to transfer the economic position. We'll need to work at documentation and process to make this as smooth as possible.

However, isn't this only the tip of the iceberg?  What about non-EOL OTC trades conducted by ECTRIC traders with counterparties that want ENA as their counterparty.  From my time in London, it was always impressed upon me that there was a quagmire of additional tax and potential regulatory (SFA) issues.  Please comment.  Also, as a commercially efficient course of action, It has always seemed to me that we should attempt to ""train"" our couterparties to accept that ECTRIC is also a Enron Corp guaranteed sub (at least it was in the past, at their request) and somehow initially set up our contracts/ISDA to be inclusive of this vehicle.  Is this possible?  Otherwise, the permutations of various legal/credit/tax/regulatory hurdles for all manner of OTC trades becomes onerous.

C/P trades via EOL with ECTRIC 2. Each trade is novated from ECTRIC to ENA, and treated as concluded under ENA ISDA Master 3. ENA enters into back-to-back trade with ECTRIC  This does mean that the C/P must initially accept the European EOL GTCs, though if we set up a mechanism whereby EOL trades are automatically novated to ENA and treated as concluded under the ENA ISDA Master, this effectively cancels out the EOL GTCs.

Cc: Abramo, Caroline; Zivic, Robyn; Diamond, Daniel; Radous, Paul; Lebrocq, Wendi; Sharma, Shifali Subject: FW: Trades as ENA  Everyone -  Our hedge fund group needs clarification on the issue of doing Brent and other European product deals w/ our hedge fund counterparties and booking them back to ENA, the entity with which all the funds have ISDAs. We just did two WTI/Brent crude oil spreads today, one w/ very large volume, and expect to be doing more such deals.   This is more than just a legal issue; it's going to impact credit and our strategy to get the funds trading on EOL as well.  As we understand it, the main legal issue is that all the funds have an ISDA only w/ ENA and not w/ ECTRIC, so they (and I assume we) want all deals and legal exposure to be w/ ENA. To satisfy both parties' desires, all European product deals must be booked from ECTRIC to ENA. Sara, from speaking to you and from Justin's response below, it seems to me that the only legal hurdle we, the funds, and our traders might face is if no trader w/ ENA in Houston okays w/ the counterparty on ENA's behalf. However, there seem to be 2 other solutions (a netting agreement and novating) that get around this. As Sara knows, dealing on legal agreements w/ the funds can be onerous and time-consuming; negotiating more paperwork is not a viable option.  From the credit side, as we understand it, the issue w/ not back-to-backing the trades w/ ENA is that the credit exposure will not be aggregated to the funds' net position in Houston and, therefore, not monitored. In other words, any exposure not sitting w/ ENA will be invisible to credit. so daily margining, etc. will  be incorrect.   From the EnronOnline side, as we see it there are a couple of issues. EOL wants the funds to trade online; an increasing number of funds also want to trade online. However, they do not want to be restricted to trading products that are only US based. Also, they would like to see more arb spread products like a WTI/Brent crude oil spread online. If neither desire can be easily met b/c we need a separate ISDA w/ ECTRIC (which potentially means, as above, more onerous and time-consuming negotiation), then it will certainly be detrimental for volume and also foresake a certain momentum that we are gaining now.   The point has been raised that the funds could trade European products if credit in London cleared them and if they were willing then to accept the general terms and conditions that pop up on EOL. We can assure you that they will not accept this.  These are the issues as we see them from the origination side. There may be other issues that we're missing from the sides that I've mentioned as well as the trading/back office side.

The current approach is the right one in the circumstances - i.e trade between ECTRIC and ENA, trade between ENA and third party (eg Bank of America). It is important that the trader agreeing to the deal with the third party in the name of ENA is located in Houston (they cannot agree deals in the name of ENA when located in London).  The pricing should be such that ENA is compensated for taking the credit risk with respect to the third party but otherwise all the economics should be with ECTRIC.   To avoid booking the back to back trades, a possibility would be an agreement on netting to be entered into by ECTRIC, ENA and Bank of America if all parties can get comfortable with the legal position.  Another alternative sometimes put forward is that ECTRIC does the deal with Bank of America, the contract is then novated from ECTRIC to ENA, and ENA enters into a back to back swap on the same financial terms with ECTRIC.  Note that we are currently working on a project to enter into financials through EFET LLC (arranged by EEFT) instead of ECTRIC (effective 1 November).

At the moment we have a number of counterparties who do not want to transact with ECTRIC but would like to do deals only with ENA (e.g. Bank of America). As a result, if a London trader wants to carry out a trade with Bank of America, he will do an internal trade with a trader in Houston and then book a trade between the Houston trader (who trades under ENA) and Bank Of America. The trades are then confirmed from the Houston office.  We were wondering about a couple of things:  Are there any tax/legal implications we should be aware of as a result of booking the trades as we do Is there a way to approach these counterparties to get them to trade with ECTRIC (as this currently creates a lot of paperwork and administration)?

How do you invest in a market that has become so unpredictable?  These are turbulent times. Turbulent in a different way than in economic cycles of the past - there's more to it this time around.  What's worked in the past won't necessarily work going forward.  And since history tells us that the best time to invest is while market sentiment is still down, it is crucial now more than ever to have the right investment guide. So when the market moves, you won't get left behind.  The Marketocracy Dream Team. What if you could tell what the world's best investors were doing every day?  The ability to buy what the best investors are buying, and sell what they are selling, would be a dream come true. For over a year, Marketocracy has been operating a web site - the forum for an incredibly effective and proven trading and performance tracking tool - designed to accurately measure the investment ability of thousands of people, in order to identify the world's most successful investors.  Currently, we follow and maintain over 50,000 track records - more than 10 times the number of equity funds tracked by Morningstar.  Never before has the investment performance of so many been so accurately measured.  Tired of Advice from People that are Losing Money? Marketocracy is based on the idea that the investors with the greatest skills will achieve the greatest successes. The idea that the only credential that really matters is track record. Our m100 Index taps into the knowledge and investing strategies of some of the best investors in the world.  Why choose a single stock-picker to make guiding investment decisions that must endure and remain strong over the long haul?  The m100 acts more like a relay team, with stock-pickers passing the baton if their performance falters, ensuring we always rely on the ""fastest and strongest runners"" for performance. With 50,000 virtual funds, we have access to a deep reservoir of proven investment talent from which to choose the best performers at any given time.  Invest with Real Intelligence - Stock Selection at Peak Performance How would you like to have 100 people as diligent as you are covering all the areas of the market that you're not familiar with? Marketocracy does what individual investors try to do for themselves - continuously seeks the strategic advice of the right people at the right time. Want to benefit from their stock picking abilities?  See For Yourself - m100 Journal Free Trial We want to give you access to the ultimate investment tool: our m100 Journal. The m100 Journal provides timely knowledge every week of what many of the world's best investors are doing right now - not last quarter, or 6 months ago - including the top buys, sells, holdings, tips, and commentary of the m100 Index.  If you want to look over the shoulders and benefit from some of the best, simply hit ""reply"" to this email, and we will send you 4 free issues of the m100 Journal, delivered to you weekly via an emailed PDF attachment.

SUMMARY                                           On October 23, 2001, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued a statement setting forth a framework for evaluating whether, and to what extent, to credit a company for self-policing, self-reporting, remediation and cooperation. The SEC encourages companies to self-report potential violations of federal securities laws to the SEC by acknowledging that the SEC may credit a company's cooperation in deciding whether and how to take enforcement action.  The elements of cooperation set forth by the SEC in its statement offer both significant rewards and risks to reporting companies.                  ----------------------------------  This e-mail is sent by a law firm and contains information that may be privileged and confidential.

"Mark:  Could you (or someone in your group) give Jane some guidance on Jane's questions as they relate to the launch of these derivative products on EOL? I would think we would want to use English or NY law to govern the swaps since ENA would be the counterparty. Jane, not only b/c ENA is the contemplated counterparty, I think we would want to avoid Japanese law and have a strong preference English or NY due to those latter legal systems having well developed bodies of financial contract law.  Thanks, Alan   -----Original Message----- From:  McBride, Jane   Sent: Tuesday, October 30, 2001 10:12 PM To: Musch, Susan; Aronowitz, Alan Cc: Bekeng, Jan-Erland; Hirl, Joseph; Niesler, Stefan; Timothy, Justin; Minns, David Subject: Enron Japan - EOL - Yen denominated WTI swap   Hi Alan (and Susan),  As you may know, Enron Japan is trying to get some yen denominated products onto EOL in an effort to try and pry the Japanese market open a little bit faster.  Although this is an Enron Japan initiative, the Enron CP would be ENA, so the governing law should probably not be Japanese (but this is unclear - there is a thought that Japanese CPs may prefer Japanese law, but it is also arguable whether they would know or care - in any case Susan, any tax issues in having ENA doing yen denominated trades over EOL under Japanese law?  Anyway the main reason for the email is that I have some very boring questions.  Alan, I am not sure (and to be honest have never really been able to figure out) who makes global EOL legal decisions, whether they come out of London or Houston (because seems to be some overlap) - but since the CP would be ENA, Houston legal will have to be involved, so perhaps Mark Taylor, but would you mind forwarding my questions to the right person.  1. Procedure wise - who should draft the GTCs for this new product? 2. If they are done under a US law - who gives legal sign off?  3. If they are done under Japanese law - can I sign off? Very happy to do so but not having any EOL experience I would need to work closely with someone from EOL legal who could confirm that other than any issues of Japanese law, they are consistent with what we want from the EOL GTCs generally. 4. Who signs off on ""product descriptions"" - what is the formal process - I assume it includes the commercial person - in this case Stefan Niesler, does it also require someone from legal, do I do this as the EJ lawyer - should l also get the ENA lawyer to approve since the CP is ENA.  Sorry if these questions seem trivial but I don't know my way on this at all and am concerned that things may fall through the cracks unless we know who will take responsibility for doing what.

Thanks, Susan    -----Original Message----- From:  Niesler, Stefan   Sent: Friday, October 26, 2001 3:32 AM To: Musch, Susan Subject: yen nominated WTI swap  Susan,  I hope I didn't confuse you too much yesterday night.  Here is a quick run down on how we think the Japanese Yen nominated WTI Swap could work:  The mechanics remain the same. The US WTI Swap quotes are converted in Yen/KL and posted on EOL. Incoming transaction are hedged out against the US WTI Swap and the FX exposure is hedge out manually.   The Enron entity entering into the initial transaction and all subsequent hedges is ENA. (same as for the US WTI Swap). The FX hedging will be done by people here in Tokyo who act as agents for ENA. (That's nothing new, they already do that.)   Fair question remaining is what is the rational for the product for ENA and why are we involved in the product development. First of all we are looking for the easiest and most practical solution. ENA is interested because it extends the reach of an exiting product and provides additional deal flow through their books. (No EJ books as touched in this transactions).  The rational for EJ is purely marketing relate. We underline our commitment to the market and proof ourselves as competitive and innovative suppliers of financial products for the Japanese Market. It is supporting our overall market penetration effort.  The issue that it is not Enron Japan entering into the contract is secondary as the Japanese market is looking at Enron as a group. Possible customer concerns about contracting with a foreign company is something we don't see as material. The customer group we are targeting are international active companies that are used to dealings with non-Japanese counterparties. In addition, the credit rating of ENA is far better the EJ's from a Japanese point of view.   I hope this helps to clarify some things. Please feel free to call me if I left anything out or if you need some additional information.  Thank you!

In essence there are 2 steps -   Firstly there is approving the GTCs and the product description. As Justin said this done by the relevant lawyer for the  jurisdiction or more particularly the  Enron counterparty. If the decision is to use US law the counterparty would be ENA. In this case an EWS lawyer in Houston would give the signoff to both the GTCs and the product description. (The two are handled together). Conversely if  Japanese law is chosen then the Enron counterparty that would do an OTC trade for that product in Japan would be the counterparty. That I assume would be EJ. Which choice of law and counterparty to use?  It has been the practice to follow the currency. For example in understand  ENA offers  Japanese and Australian weather in USD. There is also a final legal signoff given by Mark Taylor. This is generally a formality as Mark would be primarily concerned that  relevant lawyer has given their OK.  Secondly, each counterparty needs to be approved to trade the product. This is done by the lawyer responsible for the product (ie the one that approved the GTCs) as well as the lawyer where the company is incorporated/resident. Hence I would assume you would be approving Japanese counterparties irrespective of whether EJ or ENA is the counterparty.

"ENA received a letter 10/30/01 stating that Man would begin margining on a risk-weighted basis rather than using the NYMEX SPAN calculation.  This is prohibited under our futures agreement.  Man has not formally called for additional margin (which they have the right to do) but rather is withholding about $25M based upon a misunderstanding between traders about moving option positions (I'm not entirely clear about the circumstances).  Man has never claimed that the $25M was ""additional margin"".  ENA faxed a letter this morning to Man demanding the return of margin in excess of the SPAN calculation, basically a response to the letter.  ENA acounting does not have the software to execute SPAN calculations.  A recommendation to purchase the software was made by Sarah Wesner (who then reported to Joe Deffner) to accounting last year.   I understand that John Arnold intends to move most positions (including options) from Man to Paribas.  However, this information changes frequently.  Joe Deffner signed the letter and a copy was delivered to Louise Kitchen.  Let me know if you need further information.

"If Man is not holding margin in violation of the Customer Agreement, it doesn't seem to me like we should send the letter.   -----Original Message----- From:  Shackleton, Sara   Sent: Friday, November 02, 2001 12:01 PM To: Taylor, Mark E (Legal) Subject: Man Financial:  margin calculation   ENA received a letter 10/30/01 stating that Man would begin margining on a risk-weighted basis rather than using the NYMEX SPAN calculation.  This is prohibited under our futures agreement.  Man has not formally called for additional margin (which they have the right to do) but rather is withholding about $25M based upon a misunderstanding between traders about moving option positions (I'm not entirely clear about the circumstances).  Man has never claimed that the $25M was ""additional margin"".  ENA faxed a letter this morning to Man demanding the return of margin in excess of the SPAN calculation, basically a response to the letter.  ENA acounting does not have the software to execute SPAN calculations.  A recommendation to purchase the software was made by Sarah Wesner (who then reported to Joe Deffner) to accounting last year.   I understand that John Arnold intends to move most positions (including options) from Man to Paribas.  However, this information changes frequently.  Joe Deffner signed the letter and a copy was delivered to Louise Kitchen.  Let me know if you need further information.

" I think that is fine - the treasury group will just be acting at the direction of ERMT and that's ordinary course.  Of course, the services agreement should take care of all of that in the future when we have it signed up.  We just might want to come up with an informal cash management agreement in the interim such that ERMT would compensate ENE a nominal amount for those services.  Also, Baker Botts has agreed to limit the prohibition on issuance of subsidiary stock to ""Significant Subsidiaries"" within the meaning of S-X, which I believe that swapco clearly would not be given the size of Enron.

" I added the sentence on the fees to say something like at the request of or directed by ERMT.

" Attached is a revised services agreement with the fee schedule - it just needs to be dated, the draft line removed, and then I had bracketed in the fee schedule the premium to be paid for employee services (opportunity cost premium).  I have it set up so that overhead and out-of-pocket expenses are passed through at cost.  I will check with Anne and Roger Ross of our office on the license agreement - I think it is almost done.  They provided a new ""posting"" license agreement to me this afternoon, which I am still looking at.  The only corporate matter left to do is issue the ""golden share"" of ERMT LLC, which based on this morning's version of the merger agreement, won't be prohibited after we sign.  We have placed a couple of calls to our contact to provide someone to do this, but have not heard back from them today, so we will keep trying, but that shouldn't be a pacing item at this point.  The only other thing on my list is a FERC license, and after talking to Marcus this morning, I don't think Clinton is going to be an option because the golden share (as opposed to just an independent director) will apparently cause us to have to do a change of control filing for that entity anyway.   **********NOTE********** The information contained in this email message is intended only for use of the individual or entity named above.

This date appears to be an unscheduled holiday.  The issue we pose to the Committee is the following:  1.  Should ISDA issue a market practice statement on the November 23 closin= g of NYMEX?  2.  If ISDA should issue such a statement, what treatment should result for November 23?  3.  If ISDA should issue such a statement, how should options that expire o= n November 23 be treated?  (This may be less of an issue for European style options).  4.  What types of Market Disruption Events are typically included in your contracts?  I would direct your attention to Section 1.4 of the 1993 ISDA Commodity Derivatives Definitions (definition of Commodity Business Day) and ISDA's Market Practice Statement on Equity Derivatives (available on our website), where September 11, 12, 13 and 14 were not considered trading days for equity derivatives purposes.  I would be grateful if you could respond to Kimberly Summe (ksumme@isda.org= ) on each of the four questions above. Also, I propose to have a conference call on Friday, November 9 at 10:30 a.m. New York Time.

"Thanks for your note.  I've been thinking about you guys a lot, too.  I haven't been back to NYC since I left on the QE2 on 9/4.  Every time I heard about the conditions downtown I assumed you would be living in the country.  Sorry to hear you had to spend so much time in a hotel.  I know what that can be like and it loses any appeal it ever had very quickly.  Also sorry to hear about Mrs. B.  I hope she is doing better.  It has been chaotic and very depressing here -- not that our acquisition deal went through but that we ever got in the position to need the deal to go through in the first place.  In fact, when they finally announced it, my primary feeling was one of relief.  Things had gotten very bad.  Next time we get together I can fill you in on all the details.  At least for now I am still employed and my prospects are pretty good under the circumstances.  It's nice you have Key West to get away to.  You'll have to tell me about the house that you have available but under the circumstances I doubt that I could get away often enough to justify taking on a lease.  It would be nice to get away from here now and then though.  I was supposed to go to Ft. Lauderdale (did you know Ted was living there now?) a few weeks ago to visit and go to the big boat show there.  That trip had to be cancelled in all the confusion around here.  I had hoped to be in New York today for a seminar (where I was actually scheduled to speak) but cancelled that also.  With luck things will start to get back to normal here soon.  I'm really feeling the need for a break (and 4 days in Cincinnati next week don't count) so maybe I can come visit some time in the next couple of months.  Tell Don I said Hi.

They wouldn't let me order without the proofs.  They said there are more numbers on the back of the proofs than we have.  Do you still have the proofs?  I hope so, because they haven't come in the mail yet. We would really appreciate it if you could send them as soon as possible.  It takes four weeks to get the finished pictures after they are ordered and we want to put some wallet sized copies in Christmas cards.  I hope things have calmed down for you some at work.

"  The McKinsey Quarterly Newsletter: November 2001 =09   If you would prefer to view this newsletter as a Web page, point your Web=  browser to: http://www.mckinseyquarterly.com/newsletters/2001_11.htm   [IM= AGE]  Greetings from The McKinsey Quarterly!  This month's Top 5 list focus= es on strategy, a category in which McKinsey authors grapple with uncertain= ty, defined by Mr. Webster as ""a lack of certitude ranging from a small fal= ling short of definite knowledge to an almost complete lack of it."" The by-= product is often an inability to make decisions.  Since September 11, uncer= tainty seems to have gone exponential. In addition to the possibility of fu= rther terrorist attacks, managers must come to terms with recession in much=  of the global economy and a host of industry-specific concerns.  Fortunate= ly, some kinds of uncertainty are both knowable and addressable. Given the = right tools and frameworks, managers can make strategic decisions even in t= hese difficult circumstances. To this end, we offer the articles on our str= ategy page.  See you at the site!  Lang Davison Editor, mckinseyquarterly.c= om  [IMAGE]  This month at mckinseyquarterly.com   The other side of outsou= rcing   ""Infraservices"" is the business of running the businesses nobody el= se wants. It may not be glamorous, but plenty of money can be made running = routine operations (think: building maintenance or payroll processing) for = other companies. In the past few years, providers of infraservices have bee= n entering the market in increasing numbers. Should your company be in this=  business?  Building trust on-line   A funny thing happens when you survey = consumers about on-line privacy. Typically, their biggest concern isn't tha= t information about them will be captured by marketers but that marketers w= ill give nothing in return. The authors of this article explore the notion = of collaborative ""value exchanges"" as a way for companies to win their cust= omers' trust.  Internet services: Who's smiling now?   Now that growth in I= nternet traffic is slowing down, traditional IT players such as AT&T, EDS, = and IBM have gained the advantage in Internet hosting and content distribut= ion over their smaller, more specialized competitors. This article examines=  the way changes in Internet traffic patterns are playing to the strengths = of the big boys.  Unbundling the unbundled   Companies in the utility busin= ess used to be hulking and monolithic. Then they got skinnier and more nimb= le by, for instance, breaking electricity provision into its component part= s. Now more change is in store as core activities-ownership, management, an= d service delivery-get unbundled from one another and treated as separate b= usinesses.  Vaccines where they're needed   Most people in the developing w= orld go without the vaccines they need largely because the economics of dru= g development in rich countries don't line up with the economics of health = care provision in poor ones. Governments and international organizations ca= n remedy this deplorable situation by assuming some of the risks now borne = by drugmakers.  Thailand's chance for no-pain gain   This article, outlinin= g a report from the McKinsey Global Institute, identifies policy reforms th= at Thailand could make to raise productivity in key industries, without res= orting to subsidies or additional government spending. These reforms, the a= uthors argue, should be undertaken with careful consideration of their econ= omic and social implications.

"We are having Thanksgiving dinner here at our house.  Saturday, if the weather is decent, you might be interested in seeing Pyramid Hill, a sculpture park.   It isn't open on Friday.  Friday we might go to one or more of the art museums in town, or there is a fairly new aquarium over in Kentucky we haven't seen yet.  So I guess casual is the theme for the weekend.  There is a show at the Aronoff Center called, ""Blast.""  Have you heard anything about it?  Dad's boss and wife went and liked it a lot.  It sounds something like a cross between a marching band and Riverdance, if you can imagine it.  If that sounds interesting to you, we will see if we can get tickets for Friday night.  But that could  be just dressy casual, I should think.

These t= wo entities are ultimately wholly owned subsidiaries of ENA.  It is intende= d that these entities will also enter into a few weather transactions direc= tly with XL Trading Partners Ltd.  All of these transactions must have a te= rm that ends no later than midnight December 31 2001. My understanding is t= hat some time after these transactions are assigned or entered into the Chi= ricahua entities will be liquidated sometime during the month of December a= nd the weather transactions will be transferred to the parent entity which = will subsequently be liquidated and moved to its parent and so on until the=  transactions end up at ENA.

While this is a very, very good thing for the continuation of the leveraged loan market, the question remains whether it is a good thing for pro rata lenders already suffering from a risk/return mismatch. A  n oversubscription in the primary market is big news considering the past two months: Following the events of September 11, prices on transactable loans in the secondary market tumbled and investors found secondary yields to be far more rewarding than those in the primary market.  Suddenly, loans in the primary market could not get done. This realization was followed by a rash of upward flexes, original issue discount loans and LIBOR floors. The focus was squarely on fixing the ""institutional problem""; the ""pro rata problem"" was hardly discussed.  But despite taking a backseat in lender discourse, the pro rata problem remains. Even as institutional appetite fell by the wayside and struggling deals increased their pro rata tranches at the expense of floundering institutional facilities, the economics of lending remain skewed away from banks.  That is not to say that pro rata syndication technology has not evolved: Revolvers have been shrunk to their absolute minimum. And while rumors of its death may be exaggerated, the term loan A has almost been dropped from the pro rata equation and replaced with a term loan B that can be sold to both banks and institutions.  U.S. bank deals to watch  THAT SINKING FEELING  Enron Corp.'s (BBB-/Baa3 Sr. Unsec. Debt; Neg. CreditWatch) growing woes provided much food for thought before an abridged work week headed for the Thanksgiving holiday. News of an impending debt repayment of $690 million pummeled last week not only the value of outstanding Enron debt, but it also highlighted growing doubts about its takeover by Dynegy Inc. Simply put, a default by Enron on its debt obligations would leave many lenders sitting on a sizable chunk of bad debt. For the bank loan market, Enron's quagmire poses rather unpalatable scenarios. Of course for some banks there will be pressure to hold on to their exposure, but for many others the challenge will be to find a tolerable market clearing price that will allow them to shed their exposure.  A LEVERAGED LOAN PIPELINE?  According to several market observers, the window to bring to market a new leveraged deal (if one exists) is only going to be open for two more weeks at the most. Therefore, claims by many bankers that the only thing keeping them busy besides amendments and waivers are deals for 2002 sound extremely credible. T  ake for instance Northwest Natural Gas' $2.1 billion loan package backing its acquisition of Portland General Electric. The deal promising $800 million institutional paper is expected to hit market at the earliest by the second quarter of 2002 once regulatory approval is in hand. The lead banks have already firmed the deal structure and are in the process of rounding up pro rata support. The $2.1 billion package will be distributed at both the holding and operating company level of the combined NW Natural/PGE entity. At the holding company level, which is expected to be rated investment grade or near-investment grade, the facilities total $1.65 billion, including a six-year pro rata deck, split into a $100 million revolver and a $300 million term loan A. The remainder of the holdco facilities is an $800 million institutional deck, split into a $500 million, 7.5-year term loan B and a $300 million, 8.5-year term loan C. The balance of the holdco deck is a $450 million capital markets facility. The remainder of the financing package will be at the operating company level, which is expected to retain a full investment grade profile. This $450 million deck runs for six years and consists of a $150 million revolver for NW Natural and a $300 million revolver for Portland General.  IN THE MEANTIME  Before the year fizzles out, there will be some deals too keep an eye open for. Besides a prospective refinancing for Paragon Trade Brands, a new deal is rumored for media concern Fisher Communications. On the high-grade front Pitney Bowes soon is expected to approach its banks for a reduced rollover, while mortgage lender Countrywide Funding preps a $4 billion refinancing package with a sizable multi-year revolver.  --------------------------------------  High-Yield Bonds  Junk bond mutual funds summoned $628.5 million of new cash in the week ended Tuesday, according to AMG Data Services, sending the funds about $700 million above their pre-attack levels. The funds lost nearly $1.6 billion of investment in the weeks following the terrorist attacks before registering their first uptick in mid-October.  Heavily indebted cosmetics giant Revlon Consumer Products sold an upsized $363 million issue of four-year senior notes (Caa1/B-), helped along by a 920 bps spread over Treasuries attracted enough investor attention to raise the sale from an original $250 million, but bank sources declined to say how well books were filled out.  Meanwhile, books on the Veterinary Centers of America's $170 million note sale were nearly seven times subscribed, directly contrasting the concurrent and foundering $182 million IPO. The size of the Goldman Sachs-led sale was increased from $150 million of the 144A senior subordinated notes (B3/B-) at pricing. T  he eight-year issue, sold under the company's Vicar Operating subsidiary, priced to yield 502 bps over Treasuries.  Forward calendar volume appears to be building with bank sources indicating that the endgame for 2001 is going to be fairly busy, especially as compared to the fourth quarter's sluggish performance so far. Ingles Markets heads out on the road tomorrow with a $200 million deal with Radiologix, Huntsman Corp., Nextel Partners and Tommy Hilfiger soon to follow, sources say.  Deutsche Bank has the mandate for a $250 million placement for television station operator Young Broadcasting, but the deal is subject to a successful consent solicitation that expires tomorrow at 5 p.m.  Majestic Star Casino and Global Auto Logistics still are on the road, with pricing expected this week.  -----------------------------------  Secondary  Last week's holiday-shortened period produced scant trading activity. As new issue flow continues to disappoint, the secondary market necessarily remains focused on outstanding supply. Recently, dealers have had their hands full with paydown situations.  THE FLAVOR OF THE WEEK: LYONDELL  Lyondell Chemical's term loan E spiked roughly three points last week to change hands near par in retail trading on Wednesday, according to sources. The surge was sparked by word of a proposed $750 million senior secured note offering slated to repay the bulk of the TLE outstandings, as well as all of the company's remaining TLB, sources add.  The TLE, however, is non-call until next May, when the call opens at 102 (the call steps down to 101 in 2004 and the facility is callable at par thereafter), and therefore a paydown would require an amendment to the credit agreement unless Lyondell were to solicit a tender offer - a popular bond market method that has never been employed in the syndicated loan mart, according to sources.  Today, dealers are quoting Lyondell's TLE in the roughly 100-101 range, with speculation buzzing that the company may try to pay down most or all of the $800 million-plus tranche in the 101 area. As cyclical worries hit chemical credits in September, Lyondell's TLE dipped as low 93 in street trading - more than 11 points off its impressive 104.125 high set last year. As of early last week, however, bids had strengthened soundly into the mid-90s, as dropping oil prices stirred up some hope for the beleaguered chemical industry.  The prior week's paydown play, Allied Waste, held strong last week, as a small slug of B/C traded last Monday at 99. Today, with nearly 20% of the company's term debt set to be repayed, Allied's B/C paper traded up to 99.125+, as a $2.5 million and $3.7 million stub changed hands in the street.  Allied's second senior note offering of the year upsized on Nov. 15 to $750 million, and is expected to take out nearly 20% of the company's A, B and C term loans, leaving roughly $3 billion of term debt outstanding.  On the stressed side, after trading in the high 70s early the week prior, Xerox Corp.'s bank debt changed hands as high as 87 last Tuesday, in reaction to an announcement the previous Friday that the company intends to repay existing debt with proceeds from a now $900 million (up from an initial $500 million) convertible trust preferred securities offering. The sale will help shore up Xerox's balance sheet, and will offer some cushion against a possible loan covenant violation, sources note.  -----------------------------------  Middle Market  ""It's never been more dead,"" said one source achingly, while hopefully anticipating a better deal flow for next year. Across the hall at the workout desks, however, activity is ripe with action. The source added dryly, ""Those guys, meanwhile, are busy amending deals and scrutinizing collateral.""  The time is not ripe for any one particular type of deal that could potentially have investors salivating. But amidst the syndication melee, some deals have managed to cross the ""scary"" hurdles. San Diego, Calif.-based Harvest Meat Co. closed a $40 million asset-based revolver with TransAmerica Business Capital. The credit has a $6 million sublimit for letters of credit and includes a $750,000 fixed asset real estate term loan.  The five-year revolver is priced at LIB+200. The term loan - which is non-amortizing for the first 18 months - is priced at LIB+275, with a 175 bps LC fee. Closing fees are $100,000, and there is a 37.5 bps commitment fee on the revolver.  Fleet Capital, meanwhile, has provided a $75 million asset-based credit backing the buyout of Houston-based Igloo Products Corp. by Westar Capital.  Westar, a private investment firm that also owns Del Monte Foods, home healthcare firm Apria Healthcare and Doskocil Manufacturing, is purchasing the Igloo Products unit from Lake Forest, Ill.-based Brunswick Corp.  As with the previous two deals and the Nutraceutical International deal, security is paramount. Nutraceutical's recently-launched $60 million, five-year credit with sole lead arranger and administrative agent Rabobank is secured by substantially all of the company's assets, sources noted.  Opening pricing is at LIB+175 for the first 90 days. At that time, pricing switches to an undisclosed leverage-based grid. The commitment fee on the revolver is 35 bps. Commitments are due by Nov. 30, with the lead seeking $15 million and $10 million tickets from a small group consisting largely of the company's existing bank group.

"Nov. 26, 2001, 11:30PM  Sizable staff of 245 lawyers in merger limbo By MARY FLOOD Copyright 2001 Houston Chronicle  Whether troubled Enron Corp. merges, falls or stays the course, it is likely to deeply affect one of Houston's largest law offices: the one within the embattled company.  ""We've always regarded them as one of the big law firms in Houston,"" said Howard Ayers, managing partner of Andrews & Kurth, one of the city's largest firms with about 240 lawyers in Houston alone.  Enron has about 245 lawyers worldwide, company spokesman Vance Meyer said. That's a large legal stable even for a company with more than 25,000 employees. With about 145 lawyers in Houston, if it were a private firm it would have been the city's sixth-largest, according to the Chronicle 100 survey released in May.  Energy trader Enron's internal law office has burgeoned along with the huge trading firm, now set to merge with a smaller but stronger local competitor, Dynegy. As Enron's stock plummeted further, Dynegy last week denied rumors it might drop out and leave Enron to face a possible bankruptcy.  Whatever the company's fate, there are rough waters ahead for Enron lawyers.   Although most lawyers interviewed said they hope everybody remains employed and that it is premature to discuss the fate of Enron's legal staff, speculation in the legal community runs the gamut from rumors that dozens of lawyers could be laid off as early as this week to the idea that Enron will hold on tightly to its talent.  ""My guess is they'll need their lawyers while they get things in a more steady state. There's a lot of legal work to go through,"" said Joel Swanson, a senior partner at Baker & Botts, a Houston law firm with about 265 lawyers here.  Not only does Enron have a large cadre of lawyers inside its company, but it also has hired just about every large firm in Houston over the last few years. Several of the biggest Houston firms are working on the merger for either Enron or Dynegy, and others are standing by wondering which outside firms will get the biggest pieces of legal work when the new company is created.  Enron's legal department has siphoned talent from Houston's top law firms over the years. Heads of law firms said they have seen plenty of promising lawyers lured away by Enron's competitive pay combined with stock options, which were a lucrative draw until recently, as shares have lost 95 percent of their value.  ""Enron has one of the premier legal departments in the country,"" said Jeff Love, managing partner of Locke Liddell & Sapp, a Houston-based firm with about 175 of its lawyers here.  Enron has hired a lot of what are called ""laterals,"" or lawyers who have had a couple years training, often at a big firm.  Although jobs in corporate counsel offices are generally considered easier than big-firm life, that's not the reputation of Enron's legal eagles.  As with the company itself, the general counsel's office has been known as innovative and hard driving.  ""I don't think anybody lateraled into Enron with the expectation of an ordinary life,"" Ayers said.  In the Houston market, where big-firm first-year lawyers start at around $110,000 a year, the advantages of going to an expanding company like Enron were the stock options and the opportunity to grow with the company.  If heavily anticipated layoffs occur at Enron, top Houston lawyers expect casualties to land on their feet. Looming recessions are not always bad for job-hunting lawyers. Bankruptcy, litigation and mergers all can boom in rough times.  Several Houston-based law firms said they have recruited a slightly larger starting class of lawyers for 2002, meaning they don't expect to scale back their business in the immediate future.  Should the merger succeed, Enron's 245 lawyers will join Dynegy's 43.  ""The question of how you integrate the two staffs, as with a lot of things associated with the merger, won't be worked out for some time,"" Dynegy spokesman Steve Stengel said.
