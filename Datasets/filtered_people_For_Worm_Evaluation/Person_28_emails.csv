"Daren,  Thinking about Robert's little memo yesterday and along the lines of pulling  the marketing (Sitara) function back to your side of the fence I think a  strong case could be made in favor of that idea.  It is obvious that several people are involved in changing tickets, pathing,  nominating, and confirming the Industrials. This dissipates the knowledge  base and the responsibility factor. It is a ""Who's on First"" issue.  If the responsibility to ensure pricing, volume, and accomplishment of market  intent is accurately depicted, and in Sitara, is in your shop then the  schedulers could concentrate on the accuracy and correctness of Unify and  POPS. I'm sure this would help volume management and client services  immensely.  As the skill level rises in this area you could then gradually feed more and  more of the marketing function (Sitara) to the scheduling group in the hopes  they would then have a better understanding of the overhaul picture.  I believe the current situation is too much, too fast, for scheduling to  handle all at once. It has also created a situation where Robert seems to  think not only that he has all the segments mastered, but that he is the only  person that should be involved in the Industrials.  I will support whatever direction you want to go on this issue, but if you  and Pat leave things the way they are please explain to both Robert and Pat  that others may be involved in the Industrial activity and that is quite  alright.

And why did I work so late the first couple of days of  each month setting up the links when I had so much time?  I'm not going to play this game with Mr. Lloyd. When he took the time to show  up he was coached well in what was needed to be done, how to do it, and when  to do it.  This situation was entirely predictable.

FYI   Enron Field Services   -  Has not been nominated since September 99.  Have we  stopped doing business on this pipe?  (Just an FYI - ?)  Do we need to get  this assigned?  I can find old    notes and try to get this pathed if necessary.  Someone just needs to let  me know. Unresolved - appears to be unassigned?  We no longer do business on  Enron Field Services.  Lavaca Expense Transport -  This is offsystem gas that HPLC Transports for  ENA.  ENA has no nom at meter 1000 in Pops for Jan 1. Unresolved  We should  have a sale to Entex.   The deal will be enrtered in Sitara.  MidCon Texas Pipeline   -  There were deals left unpathed for Jan 1 (and  Dec?).  I brokered and nominated the obvious but we seem to have 10,000 with  transport contract to move this    gas on and no sale to broker to.  As it  stands, it looks like we have a long position.  Who is this assigned to?  I  thought Carlos was handling this one, but I could    be wrong.  Unresolved   We have a sale on ECT to Entex in Sitara.  Channel Industries Pipeline  -  Several issues here:   1. All Deals with the exception of the long term Transport Expense were left  unpathed for Jan 1.  I viewed prior month transactions and pathed  appropriately.  Someone   needs to review for accuracy. Also, there were deals that went to zero,  that were nominated for January.  Resolved but needs to be verified.   2. We still do not have enough supply to meet our sales requirement.  This  issue has been left unsresolved since October 99.  Volume Management cannot  allocate was is   not pathed and nominated.  Unresolved or Unpathed?  Carlos is looking into  this.   3. There is a transaction for January that is once again not on our point  specific transport contracts.  (Rec Mtr 1-6366 10,000 to Del Mtr 2-6203  10,000).  This is a pathed pipeline. We have no rate.  We need to know the  rate and whether one of the expense contracts needs to be amended for this  transaction, we are not legally covered.  Carlos was handling this pipe in  Dec.  Who is this assigned to for Jan? Unresolved  Carlos nom'd this to  Channel.  He knows the contract and rate (negotiated by Elsa).  HPL Operational -  This Shipper on HPL has been left unpathed for December  and January 1.  Who is this assigned to?  This can wait until we get back  next week.  If it is left     unresolved, I will get it pathed when I return.  I haven't had time to do this yet.  If we haven't figured out the assignement  then I will get to it asap.

The transport delivery off HPLC was  shorted to keep Entex whole on a minimum purchase from ENA. Originally this transport  imbalance was to be cleared the next month in May of 1999. Some of the imbalance was cleared in May of  1999, but 91,297 MMBtu still remains as a imbalance on this contract. We need to monitor the IFHSC  Index for the upcoming months so that when one is compatible with the IFHSC Index of April of 1999 we can  clear this imbalance. We will need to allocated 91,297 MMBtu extra to the transport. This will reduce the  purchase from ENA by 91,297  MMBtu for that month.  I need you to watch over whoever is doing the Reliant  Energy - Entex allocation to  make sure this happens.

"Hi Daren,  I enjoyed our lunch together yesterday and believe we made a good beginning. You have very high standards for your own performance and are highly committed to the best outcome in all situations. You are likely to have high expectations for results from our coaching meetings This a good formula for success and I will do my best to honor your strengths with a focus on moving the action forward.  With this in mind, I had some thoughts and additional questions for reflection following the meeting that I would like to share.  You are in a transition from being a  high team performer to becoming the leader of a high performing team.  One of your frustrations as leader is that members of your team seem to rely too much on you to solve problems that arise in the day to day operations of the team.  At first you responded to their requests for help by solving it for them, then you shifted to using questioning techniques to have them solve the problem with  you.  You have also offered some training to address the learnings needed to be more independent problem solvers.  You are frustrated when some members of the team continue to come to you with questions they should be able to solve and when they fail to implement changes that you have trained them to use.  You are seeking ways for the the team to have the same problem solving ability that they come to you for.  You have recruited people with this ability and you seek to expand it in the team.  This issue was the focus of our first session and needs to be the focus our next meeting.  The question is: How to engage the team in solving this problem.  How do I get the members of this team to own this responsibility and begin creating their own solutions?  What resources are needed by each person to contribute more to this problem? How do I involve the team members more in the solving of this problem? What new behaviors do I need to employ to increase the involvement of the team?  What do I need to change in myself or my relationship to the people in order to engage them more actively in the problem?  There is one dimension that I am clear about.

What I have at  present is a report from our SCADA system that must be run manually each day, to get a report of Yesterday's Volumes, beginning and ending at 7:00 a.m.  The problem is, until  I can revise it, the report shows all of our city gate volumes for all suppliers, and I need to create a new one with only the HPL stations.  I also want to set it up for automatic creation, to run at approx. 8:00 a.m. daily.  It would then be available to you for viewing via some type of bulletin board, such as  is currently being operated by George Perrine.  I will be coordinating this effort with George in that regard.  Until I have completed the entire task, however, I will try to send you a daily (5 days per week) report created manually, showing the previous day's volumes for our monitored HPL stations.

"Stella and Charlotte,   I looked into this deal.  We sold this gas for one day only.  In MOPS, the  path was nominated for 1/26 only.  However, in POPS the path was nominated  and confirmed for 1/26-1/31.  This should have been showing up as a  bridgeback error during the month.  Also, someone should have identified that  the path/nom in MOPS wasn't the same as the nom in POPS.  This discrepancy  should have been found before we closed out January.  I researched this problem by reviewing both systems (looking at the path id  in POPS, finding it in MOPS, and checking the audit on the path in MOPS).   This type of issue should be researched and solved by the logistics group,  who has all the necessary tools to find the problem.  The resolution, not the  problem, should have been presented to myself or the marketer, with an  explanation of what happened.  Some one still needs to find out how the gas  was confirmed for the 27th-31st.  Since the gas apparently flowed, we will have to apply the overflow to the  OBA.

"Daren you are correct in that this was only in MOPS for the 26th.  It was  edi'd over to POPS from the 25th through the 31st populating all days with  the 16,700 nom.  The nom was never -0- out in POPS therefore the change  notification process in POPS did not pick up a change at this meter.  This  meter is pathed by Kim and confirmed by me - it is extremely odd that this  was missed in MOPS.  The record would have been out of balance and someone,  if not several people, normally would make a comment on this.   Also  -  all  of my records indicate that the 16,700 was good through the 31st except the  MOPS entry.  My confirmations with Koch didn't reflect the -0- ;  the last  report I have from Koch indicated the 16,700 stayed on, there was no record  of a phone call indicating anything other than 16,700.  It is very odd for  this many checks and balances to fail.  Also, the volumes were being sent  back to MOPS which no one caught.     I have spoken with Koch today and they agree that the 16,700 should have gone  to -0- therefore I have removed the nom from POPS confirmed volumes and  re-allocated the meter.  The OBA has taken the hit and I am working off the  imbalance now.  Daren, I am sorry that you had to look into this when you feel this is my  responsibility.  Stella was trying to help me out in clearing up errors  because I was buried in current activity, thus the e-mail to you asking for  your help.

Thanks,  Charlotte      Daren J Farmer 02/14/2000 12:50 PM To: Stella L Morris/HOU/ECT@ECT, Charlotte Hawkins/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: Pat Clynes/Corp/Enron@ENRON  Subject: Re: Sale to Shoreline    Stella and Charlotte,   I looked into this deal.  We sold this gas for one day only.  In MOPS, the  path was nominated for 1/26 only.  However, in POPS the path was nominated  and confirmed for 1/26-1/31.  This should have been showing up as a  bridgeback error during the month.  Also, someone should have identified that  the path/nom in MOPS wasn't the same as the nom in POPS.  This discrepancy  should have been found before we closed out January.  I researched this problem by reviewing both systems (looking at the path id  in POPS, finding it in MOPS, and checking the audit on the path in MOPS).   This type of issue should be researched and solved by the logistics group,  who has all the necessary tools to find the problem.  The resolution, not the  problem, should have been presented to myself or the marketer, with an  explanation of what happened.  Some one still needs to find out how the gas  was confirmed for the 27th-31st.  Since the gas apparently flowed, we will have to apply the overflow to the  OBA.  Unless you can find a missing transport contract.

They can get their expense numbers  either from their estimate (from CPR) or from Unify, where we put the rates  in.  One potential enhancement would be that in addition to managing rates for the  transport capacity tickets, we set up the rates for the transport usage  tickets.  I am going through the transport usage tickets for February right  now (as part of the market meter study) and I see some rates I don't tie back  to Lauri's matrix.  For example, Lauri's matrix shows 0.05 from Thompsonville  to HSC, but the transport usage ticket (updated by Daren's group) has 0.055.   This means the economic estimate can be off.

"In February, 539,594 Mmbtu were allocated to the our index purchase from HPLR  Liquids at King Ranch.  This allocation resulted in a large physical  unaccounted for loss.  Effectively, the gas was being purchased twice in our  systems.  In addition, a sale to the Liquids group, which should have been  zero, was brokered with a purchase from Swift (2500 Mmbtu/day), resluting in  additional gas being allocated to the HPLR Liquids purchase contract.  I have  attached a schedule detailing the volumes that were double booked in  February.  This schedule also reports the daily volumes for March which will  need to be adjusted.  I have calculated (based on estimates) that we should  have only purchased about 88,000 from the Liquids group at King Ranch for  February.  See the following:  Booked to HPLR Liquids: 539,574  18,606/day Purch by HPLC @ WH:  379,108  13,073/day Incorrect Liquids Sale:    72,500  2,500/day      Adjusted purch from Liquids:   87,986  3,034/day   We usually input a purchase of 2,500 Mmbtu/day from HPLR Liquids at the  tailgate.  We can increase this to 3,000/day for March.  The majority of gas in the 3-Rivers system is transported to the King Ranch  plant through HGPL.  Some of this gas is purchased at the wellhead by HPLC,  some of the gas is purchased at the wellhead by HPLR Liquids, and three  producers have the option to either sell their gas to HPLC at the wellhead or  to process their gas and sell the residue to HPLC at the tailgate of the  plant.  It is very important to keep the meters and volumes allocated  correctly among parties related to these transactions.  The attached schedule  should assist in doing this.  I have reported the meters at which HPLC buys  wellhead gas.  The movement of this gas through HGPL and King Ranch should be  kept seperate from the gas purchased by the Liquids group.  A transport usage  ticket can be used to show the transfer of HPLC's gas from King Ranch to HPL.  Let's plan on discussing this either Friday or Monday afternoon.  Let me know  what works best for you.

Craig Faulbaum has taken personal some  time off (I think that this is the 4th week).  So, we have picked up his  trades.  Tom restructured the EOL trading.  Carey has gone to Gas Daily and I  have taken over the Waha trading for an interim period.  (I'm still  responsible for our overall position, but Ami is watching it during  trading.)  In other words, everyone on my desk is doing double duty.  And, of  course, Tom expects nothing to fall through the gaps (not cracks, anymore).   He has two opening on the trading side that we (Stacey and I) are filling.  I  don't know if he has even interviewed anyone yet.  I am getting very  frustrated with the whole business.  It doesn't see that he even appreciates  the amount of time and stress we are going through to pick up his slack.   Wheww...That feels a little better... getting some of that off my chest.   Anyway, Tonya is very uncomfortable.  I think that baby is going to come  along any day now (due date is still 3/18).  We are both definitely ready.   The desk is really going to be in a fix when I'm out with that.  That's just  too bad.  (I half expect Tom to ask me to come in some.  I've got a real  quick answer to that.)

"Hi,  I figured something must be occupying your time other than answering  non-business e-mail.  You guys must all be getting double salaries for doing 2 jobs each. ----  right? (chuckle).  If Tom really lets you take the time off for the baby and if you really have  the time; lunch would be great. Just give me a call. Only if all the ifs  really allow you the time.  Is Craig ok?? I hope.  I would be glad to help with your sprinkler system. My sharpshooter is older  than you are, but I imagine it is built a little better. My requested wages  for that sort of work would make renting a trencher very cheap for you. I  would be happy to come by and keep an eye on the cold beer. That would be  free of charge.  I'm having a cable modem installed Monday. Supposed to be 50-70 times faster  than what I have. I do way to much jumping around to run off this slow modem.  I can then dump my other phone line. Actually will end up spending less for  more speed. I love technology.  Thanks for the info on the stock option. That is the closing price as of  1/18/00, which is right before the jump. very nice of management. I like to  know the number to see what might be affecting the price.

(A purchase of gas in storage with no physical movement per comments in  sitara).    Per our conversation Friday, it sounds like HPLC does owe Mobil for his  gas, right?   Sale to Mobil: 1/2000 - Per the pipe statement provided by Greg Bonin for Centana volumes,  299,893   flowed in January.  I billed 299,893 and Mobil paid it.  Logistics said 19,893 of the gas that flowed was not our sale to Mobil  because  the gas wasn't scheduled.  In addition, if the 19,893 were a sale to Mobil,  the   point would not be in balance in the system.  The source of 280,000 of the  gas  says they only sold 280,000mms and not any more. No other sources are in the  system.    I assume if the 19,893 wasn't consumed by Mobil, they wouldn't have   paid for it.   Is there storage involved here?  If so, whose storage and how  did it work?   There are sales in other months with discrepancies on Centana with smaller  volumes  than in 1/2000.  Once I understand what happened in January, maybe that will  help me with the other months.  Please let me know if there is any other information you need from me  relating to  the questions above and when would be a good time for you to discuss this.

Pass on to any who may need this.  In order to provide the ability to track transport expense by Desk, Sitara  was modified to allow multiple Transport Capacity tickets for the same  Service Contract provided that they are for different desks and only one is  tagged as ""Primary"".  Here is the procedure for setting up new Capacity  tickets to reflect the ""other"" desks:  a.  You will probably first notice this via a warning/error message in Path  Manager when building a new path.  The message will read something like    ""Source/Destination 123456 for desk IMCT does not match Service contract 3434  and will be removed."" b.  Make note of the deal number in the Service List of the Service contract  that you were using in the new path. c.  Open that Transport Capacity deal in Sitara.  Then hit Copy. d.  On the new deal:  Change the Buyer from the old desk to the new desk that matches the Supply  or Market deal that you are pathing with.  If it a deal for which we are    agent, then don't change the Buyer but instead change the Agent to the new  desk.  The ""primary"" deal will carry the actual Agent.  The Agent   contract will get cleared.  Re-select the Agent Contract.  Changing the Buyer causes the Contract field to get blanked out.  Re-select  the Pipeline contract.  Just above the various exchange line items is a Primary Deal check box.   Un-check it.  On each exchange line item, change the MDQ to zero and for any Negotiated  rates, uncheck them as well.  The ""primary"" deal will carry the MDQ and   any negotiated Demand, Commodity or fuel.  Hit Release. e.  You may need to re-retrieve Path Manager.  You should see the Deal number  in the Service list now read ""Multiple"".  Right-click/Service Deals will list  the  specific deals. f.  Re-build the path as you originally desired.  The warning/error message  should not appear again.  This could occur for any combination of Desk and Service Contract. Please file this in your ""Call Dave If I Can't Find This"" folder.

This change went in for the Deal Validation group.   It gives them the  ability to change counterparties names after bridge back.

Some pipelines do not allow us to change counterparties after there is  feedback - I assume for the same reasons we had this rule - it used to blow up our old scheduling systems  (pre-UNIFY).  Some pipelines will require a new  deal and we will have to zero out the old deal.  Before you make the change - make sure the logistics person is aware - just  in case it causes problems with their pipeline.   Sorry - I don't know which pipes these are - you will have to ask  the UNIFY team.  There is one rule still in place - you can change from ENA-IM East to ENA-IM  Market East - but not from  ENA-IM Texas to HPLC-IM HPLC - when changing business units - they must be  the same legal entity.  ""Warning - not the same legal entity""  Also - beware of making contract and counterparty changes to Service deals  (Transport Capacity, Storage, Cash Out). Once the deal is invalidated - there are no rules.  Don't forget - the items  were locked down for a reason.  If you invalidate a service deal - and change the previously locked down  data that was validated - and someone used these deals in UNIFY - it is highly likely that the UNIFY deals and paths created  using these deals will get corrupted.  Always check  with someone from UNIFY to make sure no one used these deals for anything in  UNIFY.      ---------------------- Forwarded by Thomas Engel/HOU/ECT on 04/05/2000 09:47  AM --------------------------- From: Scott Mills on 04/04/2000 07:38 PM To: Kathryn Cordes/HOU/ECT@ECT, Dana Daigle/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Elizabeth L  Hernandez/HOU/ECT@ECT, Julie Meyers/HOU/ECT@ECT, B Scott Palmer/HOU/ECT@ECT,  Stephanie Sever/HOU/ECT@ECT, Dianne J Swiber/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: Steve Jackson/HOU/ECT@ECT, Thomas Engel/HOU/ECT@ECT, Sylvia A  Campos/HOU/ECT@ECT, Linda S Bryan/HOU/ECT@ECT, Faye Ellis/HOU/ECT@ECT, Donna  Consemiu/HOU/ECT@ECT  Subject: Sitara Release (Re: Changes in Global due to Consent to Assignment)    With the release that was put out Tuesday evening, Deal Validation should be  able to change the counterparty on deals where the volume is something other  than expected (e.g. confirmed, nominated, scheduled, etc.).

I hope the following will give more clarification.     Let me know if you have any questions or need more detail!   Thanks, dg  3-9517   Sitara / Unify - Process * Scenario - Counterparty name changes on Sitara deal ticket after deal had  been pathed, scheduled & bridged back from Unify. * Impact - zero impact to Logistics & Volume Management, absolutely  harmless.  Settlements has process in place to eliminate issues. * Process -  Counterparty A in Sitara changes to Counterparty B.    Ctprty A was on original path sent to pipeline.   The new name (ctprty B) does bridge over to Unify. Ctprty A remains at the path level in Unify (gui display does not change) Ctprty B is now displayed at the deal level in Unify.  The field is now  highlighted to indicate a change occurred. (gui display changes only at high  level, not on path) The Scheduler has choice to repath (if necessary), or not re-path If re-pathing occurs, the new counterparty name will be displaced on new path  Unify pushes back the deal number & meter to Sitara (not ctprty info) Balancing works on deal number & meter only (not ctprty info) The confirmation desk utilizes the information in Sitara (where all  information is correct) Volume Management utilizes the information in Unify for pipeline tie-out.

Settlements recognizes that changed ctprty names changes contracts, which  would create two notification entries If invoice did happen to go out to wrong ctprty, re-draft would occur. (note:  there was an issues discovered on reports which IT is correcting now)   Autonoms ""Tom's words of warning"" -  Previously there was an issue when counterparty name changes took place after  deals were pathed and nominated.  Basically it would change a key on an EDI  path (duns number) not affecting any other of the information already  nominated to the pipeline.  If the scheduler re-nominated, data at the  pipeline would get doubled up and the scheduler would have NO way to correct  the problem.  In most cases, the schedulers would have to get the pipeline to  manually cut the original nominated volume.  This is not an issue with Unify  (as explained above).

This change went in for the Deal Validation group.   It gives them the  ability to change counterparties names after bridge back.  Impact to Logistics - Unify If a counterparty name change takes place to deals that have been bridge  backed, it could cause problems on EDI pipes as that new counterparty name  will flow over to Unify and repathing should eventually take place. One problem may be with the Imbalance data sets, which are not in production  yet......(EDI Imbalance Qtys would not match up to paths) This may also cause an issue with the scheduled quantities (especially where  nominations were sent for entire month) can't remember the rules on this one, but I think Unify does have some safe  guards (idiot proofs) to force re-pathing. Unify does have the ability to over-ride duns numbers, yet would still cause  an additional step for EDI the scheduler would need to think through in order  to get a clean quick response. What are (if any) impacts to Vol Mgt if counterparty name changes take  place?  (prior periods?  re-pathing?)  I have a call into Diane and Dave both.  After speaking w/ them, hopefully I  can get a clear understanding of the true impact.  I am sure we'll need to  put some processes and procedures together for Deal Validation to follow when  these type of changes are needed.  Will keep you posted.

Some pipelines do not allow us to change counterparties after there is  feedback - I assume for the same reasons we had this rule - it used to blow up our old scheduling systems  (pre-UNIFY).  Some pipelines will require a new  deal and we will have to zero out the old deal.  Before you make the change - make sure the logistics person is aware - just  in case it causes problems with their pipeline.   Sorry - I don't know which pipes these are - you will have to ask  the UNIFY team.  There is one rule still in place - you can change from ENA-IM East to ENA-IM  Market East - but not from  ENA-IM Texas to HPLC-IM HPLC - when changing business units - they must be  the same legal entity.  ""Warning - not the same legal entity""  Also - beware of making contract and counterparty changes to Service deals  (Transport Capacity, Storage, Cash Out). Once the deal is invalidated - there are no rules.  Don't forget - the items  were locked down for a reason.  If you invalidate a service deal - and change the previously locked down  data that was validated - and someone used these deals in UNIFY - it is highly likely that the UNIFY deals and paths created  using these deals will get corrupted.  Always check  with someone from UNIFY to make sure no one used these deals for anything in  UNIFY.      ---------------------- Forwarded by Thomas Engel/HOU/ECT on 04/05/2000 09:47  AM --------------------------- From: Scott Mills on 04/04/2000 07:38 PM To: Kathryn Cordes/HOU/ECT@ECT, Dana Daigle/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Elizabeth L  Hernandez/HOU/ECT@ECT, Julie Meyers/HOU/ECT@ECT, B Scott Palmer/HOU/ECT@ECT,  Stephanie Sever/HOU/ECT@ECT, Dianne J Swiber/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: Steve Jackson/HOU/ECT@ECT, Thomas Engel/HOU/ECT@ECT, Sylvia A  Campos/HOU/ECT@ECT, Linda S Bryan/HOU/ECT@ECT, Faye Ellis/HOU/ECT@ECT, Donna  Consemiu/HOU/ECT@ECT  Subject: Sitara Release (Re: Changes in Global due to Consent to Assignment)    With the release that was put out Tuesday evening, Deal Validation should be  able to change the counterparty on deals where the volume is something other  than expected (e.g. confirmed, nominated, scheduled, etc.).

Currently Unify is adding all excess volume for each day  and pricing the first 10,000 at a certain price and anything over 10,000 at a  different price.  For example meter 1553 may have 5000 on the first, meter  1384 may have 5000, and meter 1552 may have 5000.  Unify currently prices the  first 10,000 at a certain price, and 5000 at a different price.  This is  incorrect because none of the meters exceeded 10,000, each meter should be  priced at the first tier level.  Robert needs to set up one additional sale  ticket and one additional buyback ticket, but he will not schedule gas to  these tickets.  Anita Luong will move the volumes to the correct ticket when  she allocates the volumes each month.

For the month of March, please provide a  completed ""Hours"" survey for each position within your group.  This survey  will collect the  time your team spent on performing their activities in the  month of March.     NOTE: We are now collecting EOL related activities.  If you spend time  directly supporting EOL, and your survey does not have an activity that you  can assign these times to, please contact me as soon as possible so we can  add the appropriate activities to your survey.  To fill out the survey:  At the top of the spreadsheet, you will see a box labelled ""Select Your RC"".   Click on the box and input your RC number, which will need to be 4 digits. Once you have done this, another box will appear with the message ""Select  Position from Drop Box!"" You can then select the position (i.e., staff,  specialist, etc.) and ""OK"". The choices for positions are based on  information contained in the Org Database (i.e., if a position is not listed  that should be, please call me to discuss as it would indicate that  corrections need to be made to the database).  Once you have the list of  activities, please input hours (for the entire month) for each activity  listed in the column labelled ""Hours"". If you're filling out the survey for your team, save a file for each of the  positions you fill out for your team prior to filling out the next position.   If you do not, the information will be lost.  We have included February compiled hours per position (if you had two  specialists performing the same activity - 20 hours each, the ""Last Month""  column would show a total of 40 hrs for that month).  As with last month, you  have the option to complete the survey on behalf of your entire group or send  this survey to each of your team members, allowing each individual to fill  out the time they spent on each activity.  If there are any activities you  perform not included in your survey, please contact me as soon as possible  for a copy of the Activity Dictionary.  Please return these surveys by end of day Wednesday, April 5th.  If this is a  problem, please notify me or Lisa Cousino immediately.

In the 'Data' tab, please  select the your RCs, and fill in the driver quantity for the requested driver  for the month of February. Please fill out the attached activity driver  survey with March numbers for your RC by end of day Wednesday, April 5th.  If  your group currently generates a standard report that captures the surveyed  data, please send the report to me, and put me on your recipient list  beginning next month.  This will eliminate your need to fill out this survey  every month.  If you would like us to collect this information from someone  within your team beginning next month, please let me know.    Please take this opportunity to verify the following: 1. The driver indicates a measure for the time and effort your team spent to  perform these activities for each commercial team. 2. The activity is spent in support of the commercial teams identified  (please let us know otherwise) 3. If the activity is using an allocation (for example ""Allocate 0469"" or  ""80-20 Split""), that the percentage allocated to each commercial team has not  changed from last month.   (Please let us know if it has changed what the new  allocation is).  In reference to these surveys, please note: If you are allocating only infrastructure costs to some commercial teams  listed in the survey, please identify them.  We will take your business  support costs (such as feedback, training, etc.) and allocate them evenly  among these teams. The costs for ""commercial team specific"" activities that you filled time out  for in the January time survey will be directly allocated to that commercial  team (e.g. Genco Support will trace 100% of its costs to Genco).

Attached is an organizational chart  for the Texas region.    We too continue to look for efficiencies to ensure we meet the demands of our  customers.  We currently support the Texas trading region, Bammel Storage  Facility, Houston Pipeline, Powder River Gathering and Bridgeline.  I am  pleased to announce that we will also combine Risk Management, Deal  Validation and Operational Analysis under the management of Steve Venturatos  who will serve as the Business Controller.  Dave Baumbach will fill the Lead  position.  Ami Chokshi will move from Trading Support to the new group,  continuing in the role of the Entex and TUFCO account manager.  Jody Crook  also will join the team.  Bryan Hull will transition his knowledge over the  next month, and will be moving to has second rotation, effective 6/5/00.   Additionally, Will Kelly will transition the Denver trading books to the  Texas team as he moves to the East Region.  Transportation Management under  Mary Smith will NOT be integrated into the team as their day-to-day  responsibilities and projects are not cohesively aligned with this group.   Please join me in welcoming the new team members as well as the team members  who will continue in the group.  Mike Eiben will step in the role previously managed by Steve Venturatos which  includes Global Contracts and Facilities, System Enhancements and Regulatory  Reporting.  In addition, Clem Cernosek and Jennifer Pattison will be assuming  new responsibilities in Logistics and Volume Management, respectively.  Both  Clem and Jennifer have been on the Unify team, focused on POPS.  Please wish  these folks success in their new roles.  All responsibility changes are effective 5/1/00.    Please share this with your staffs.         ","ami.chokshi@enron.com, stacey.neuweiler@enron.com",daren.farmer@enron.com,Organizational Changes,2000-05-02 05:36:00-07:00,sent

The duration of the  problem was due to a type of system behavior we had not experienced before.   The problem was exacerbated by a multitude of additional user logins thinking  that a fresh login might work better.  Additional logins never improve  performance and generally degrade it, but that is another story.  (There was  actually a single user with 21 sessions!)  We had to ""bounce"" the server  twice to bring the system back to its normal level of performance.  The good news is that we found out what caused the problem.  It was not a  particular user or a particular report or process.  It was actually an  intentional change to a specific table that we have done numerous times in  the past, but this particular change had drastic side effects.  We have  contacted Sybase with this problem to see if they can help determine if the  behavior is a ""feature"" or a bug.  In the meanwhile, we will do these types  of changes at night during scheduled outages.  I apologize for the frustration, anxiety, and extra work brought on by this  problem and will take every precaution to see that it does not happen again.   If you have any further questions or comments, please feel free to give me a  call.  Dave N.

"Cheryl,   The counterparties with which ENA currently sales gas are:  City of Brazoria Central Illinois Light Company D & H Gas Company, Inc. Markham Gas  Merit Energy Partners Praxair Reliant Energy - Entex Reliant Energy - HL&P Southern Union Company Texas Utilities Fuel Company (Now TXU Fuel Co) Union Carbide Corporation Unit Gas Transmission Company Inc   ENA has transacted with the other companies listed below, but that will most  likely not happen again.  (HPL will trade with those counterparties.)  All ENA trades on HPL will be in Sitara.  We have reports which can be  generated out of CPR that can list all deals by counterparty for ENA.

She is trying to draft a long-term transport/storage agreement between ENA &  HPLC which will allow ENA to move the gas to their markets.  In order to  accomplish this, she needs to know all of the Sales to customers that ENA is  doing off of HPL's pipe.  I had Scott Mills run a report from Sitara showing all ENA Buy/Sell Activity  on HPL since 7/99.  If I eliminate the Buys & the desk-to-desk deals, will  this give me everything that I need?  Are there buy/sell deals done with ENA on HPL's pipe that wouldn't show up in  Sitara?  Someone mentioned something about deals where HPL transports the gas  on it's own behalf then ENA sells it to a customer at that same spot  --   ?????  Do deals like that happen? Would they show up in Sitara?  Is there anything else that I'm missing?  I'm not real familiar with how some  of these deals happen nowadays so am very receptive to any  ideas/suggestions/help that you can offer !!!  Thanks in advance.

That's right, we are going bowling!!!!   Tuesday, June 6th all of Gas Assets, everyone under Brenda's direction, will  be going Bowling.  We will depart the Enron building between 2:45 and 3:15 on  buses (no not the yellow kind) and we head for Dynamic Lanes, where everyone  will be placed on a team of 4, bowl three games, compete and cheat (just  joking) for fabulous prizes and then return to the Enron building around 6:00  pm, just in time to catch buses and go home.  FAQ Is it mandatory that I go?  No, BUT you will be gravely missed if you are not there, you will be left out  of all the inside jokes that are sure to come as a result of this event, and  you run the risk of being ridiculed by your co-workers for not attending.    If I don't go bowling can I leave work / stop working at 2:45. ?  No.  If I do go does that mean I do not have to return to work to complete  required daily tasks such as P&L?

"Steve,   I really need the Oasis and PGE transport contracts assigned to HPL by July  2000.  Currently, we are buying gas in the Waha region as HPLC.  But since  our transport is under ENA, we have to enter an additional transaction where  HPL sales the gas to ENA at the point of purchase.  ENA then transports the  gas to a delivery point.  If the gas is sold to another counterparty, an  additional transaction between ENA and HPL must be entered at the delivery  point.  This causes great difficulty in balancing out the pipelines and  completing the scheduling in reasonable time.  Plus, it just doesn't make  sense to keep the transport under ENA since we transact all other deals as  HPLC.  Please let me know when we can get these contracts assigned.  Thanks for your help.

In the past, I have directed the implementation of  several pricing systems based on activity based costing similar to the  Operations Pricing Model (OPM).  Over the past couple of weeks my  observations of the Model have lead me to be concerned with the quality of  data used in the model.  It will take efforts by both you and the OPM team to  get to a satisfactory level of data quality.  This process can start with  this months data collection efforts.  Please pay particular attention this  month as the ""bar is being raised"" by the management of Energy Operations for  data quality and timeliness.  The attached survey drives your costs from your activities to the commercial  teams.  Please select your RCs, and fill in the driver quantity for the  requested driver for the month of May. Please fill out the attached activity  driver survey with May numbers for your RC and return to Shari Mao by end of  day Friday, June 2.  Please note the following updates: For Nat Gas, Sally Beck is interested in physical (as denoted as PH in the  survey) vs. financial (as denoted as FI in the survey) numbers, please  provide statistics accordingly If a driver has not been updated per your request, please call or email  Jennifer Reside If you have additional updates / suggestions or items that need correction,  please call or email Jennifer Reside  If your group currently generates a standard report that captures the  surveyed data, please send the report to Jennifer Reside.

This adjustment arrangement doesn't seem to be  papered - it's just occurred each month for the past 5 years on a relatively  routine basis.  Since the adjustment arrangement isn't papered, we've been having difficulty  properly reflecting the deal in sitara and unify.  It has been suggested that  we try to paper the deal for posterity (the lease to TECO has 9 more years to  run), but, in view of the forthcoming expiration of the primary term of both  the Comstock and Oryx (Sun and/or Kerr-McGee) contracts, I'm reluctant to  open this can of worms.  I'd like your thoughts.  George x3-6992  ---------------------- Forwarded by George Weissman/HOU/ECT on 03/29/2000  07:53 AM ---------------------------      Enron North America Corp.

HPLR once had an appropriate agreement in place, but that  agreement has been assigned to ECT.

In April '99, these contracts  were assigned to ECT.  In October of 1998, these contracts should have been  assigned to HPLC, but did not get assigned.  Beginning in Jan. '99, negative  volumes started appearing in my purchase payment statements under Sitara  #18372 (meter #6884), causing my payments to be reduced.  I believe that the  deal number for the sale was being attached to the purchase contract.  (The  purchase deal numbers which I have been using are Sitara #14086 and Sitara  #11079).  Both these sales and purchases (since October '98) are suppose to  be for HPLC.  Donald Reinhart stated that spot purchase and spot sale GTC's  between Teco and HPLC can be set up from October of 1998 until the Master  Contract is changed.  Amelia Alland has set these up, which I believe  terminate in October '99.  The GTC spot contract numbers are as follows:   Purchases:  012-86978-102; Global 96021450  Sales: 012-86978-301; Global 96021451   Per our conversation earlier can you make these retroactive adjustments?   When complete, can you tell me what the new deal numbers will be?

We already have one in the  East.  I stressed to the Sitara/EOL folks the importance of adding comments  to the term sections of these baseload and term tickets so we know what is  happening.  One side of these buy/sell or exchange deals will be ratable and  the corresponding partner ticket will have the optionality.Comments will  include the corresponding deal number, that it is in fact a buy/sell or  exchange deal and the delivery time period(3,5 or 10 days) that the  counterparty desires. I hope this helps...THANKS!   ---------------------- Forwarded by Victor Lamadrid/HOU/ECT on 06/27/2000  02:51 PM ---------------------------          From:  Thomas Engel                           06/26/2000 11:49 AM    To: Linda S Bryan/HOU/ECT@ECT, Karen Lambert/HOU/ECT@ECT, Larry Joe  Hunter/HOU/ECT@ECT, Dale Neuner/HOU/ECT@ECT, Victor Lamadrid/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: Bob Bowen/HOU/ECT@ECT, Scott Mills/HOU/ECT@ECT  Subject: Flexible Physical US Nat Gas Products on EnronOnline   Can you all meet this afternoon or tomorrow to discuss this.

This looks like a monthly  volume that would be further refined to daily on the expected volumes once  the counterparty has made their decision  (I would imagine logistics will be  the one communicating with the counterparty).  We probably need EOL to  indicate whether it is a 3, 5, 10 day delivery cycle and then indicate this  as comments.  Linda/Karen -what are your thoughts on how separate GTC would work on this.  If we could all do a little homework.  I will get something scheduled for  next week to discuss further.

Legal is in the process of drafting a  GTC and Product Type description that will be used with this Product Type. I  will start the building process once Legal provides the GTC and Product Type  description; but in the interim, here's a broadstroke description of how the  transaction works:  Party A and Party B exchange gas during the month of June 2000.  Party A buys 10,000 MMBtu per day (or 300,000 total MMBtu) at TCO Pool Index  Party B has the right to notify Party A of when Party B wants to take  delivery during the month of June, and may take delivery in one of three  forms: 3-day delivery, 5-day delivery, or 10-day delivery. The gas nominated  for each such day would be a percentage of the total 300,000 MMBtu (i.e.; If  Party B chooses 5 days for nomination, Party A would deliver 20% of the  300,000 MMBtu on each of those 5 days for a total nom of 100%).  Party B pay  TCO Pool Index PLUS a premium.  I understand that this type of transaction is currently done  over-the-counter. Scott Mills has previously issued an explanatory e-mail of  Sitara concerns and we should begin to address those issues.  Bjorn - if you could ask someone to prepare a Sigma Factor in advance, then  my turn around time to for the Product Type should be reduced. Also, due to  the varying 'optionality', do you think these three different products will  require three different Product Types?  Please feel free to call if you have any questions.

"We didn't buy anything from Pan Energy at Centana Mobil until April the 3rd.   So, we shouldn't pay for this gas.  D     Katherine Herrera@ENRON 07/28/2000 01:21 PM To: Daren J Farmer/HOU/ECT@ECT cc:   Subject: Re: Centana Mobil April 00   PanEnergy purchase: Deal #231758.   Gas in the amount of 271 mmbtus for April 1st was purchased from PanEnergy on  deal # 231758 .  However, scheduling has indicated that they have no sale for that gas on day  one and as a result, it is not pathed in the system.   Could you please review this item and see if it should or shouldn't be a sale  so that Scheduling can either path April 1st or I can dispute the volume  being billed to us by Pan Energy.    This is part of Pan Energy's exchange deal.

"B,   I have had the following problems with the recruiting process recently:  1)  After leaving Toni a message stating that I wanted to offer a postion to  Liz Bellamy, additional interviews were being set up for other groups to  interview her.  Liz had shown up on Dave Baumbach's schedule 2 or 3 times,  even after his manager, Steve Venturatos, interviewed her for me.  Pat Clynes  fond that this was happening while I was out of the office and immediately  called Toni to get it straightened out.  Toni called me at home, which is  good, but whe was not logged into the system, so she was not prepared to  discuss information with me.  2)  At first, Toni was not very responsive to colls/voice mails.  This has  improved over the last week.  She has called me a couple of times awaiting my  decision on salary concerns.  So, I think that she is trying to stay on top  of this now.

We have been estimating the overtakes each  day at 15, 000.  However, because of limitations of the scheduling system, we  can't nom the volumes estimated on the swing deal.

The deal # is 250237.  I looked at the publication and it shows that the price should be $2.95.   The price of $2.95 plus $1 would equal the price of $2.96 which is what Duke  is  claiming the price to be instead of what we are showing which is $3.95.

"10,000 should be allocated to Adonis #51862 on the 5th only.  Nothing should  be allocated or confirmed for Adonis on the 16th.  Additionally, it looks  like 5000 was confirmed as a receipt from Mitchell (Track ID 3167) on the  16th.  This should be -0- also.  By taking the conf/allocation for Adonis  (Track ID 6155) and Mitchell (Track ID 3167) to zero on the 16th, the meter  balance remains the same and the bridge errors will be cleared.

"   The only valid ""Buyback"" ticket for Meter #: 1373 is Sitara Ticket #:  246408.  S. Ticket #: 156342 is an old ticket which was used to set up  Buyback         ticket across Equistar's meters{1552,1384,1062,1553}. If  you recall  this process was done to enable Client Services to automate Equistar        allocation/billing. The project took place around April 2000  production retroactive back to Jan. 1999.  The link to compute the buyback is  set up         on S. ticket # 246408.         Since Equistar has begun doing business via ENA, it was necessary to  establish a ""Buyback Ticket "" on ENA's Matrix.        Thus, to answer your question, yes there should only be one ""buyback  ticket"" for meter #: 1373 on HPL  and ENA.         ENA activity is kept whole and the swing is on HPL.         I hope I have addressed all of your questions below however, I am  available for follow up discussion if needed.          It  has been a pleasure working with you.

SALARIES, SALARIES, SALARIES!!!   Everyone is having problems.   Unfortunately, many of you are new to your jobs and did not inherit paperwork to know what your  staff's salary is.  I have the average salary for each of the different staffing levels.  I have asked the HR  department to also give me the low and the high.  Let's face it - your staff today and their salary most  likely are not what they are going to be next year!  To much movement of people.  So using  estimates and averages will probably be as accurate as using current salary levels.  Here's what you can do:  1) Make a list of your staff just their positions. 2) Then put down if you think I should budget high, mid, average, low, low to  average, etc.  You can guess at this based on their experience, length of time in that  position, etc. 3) Then I will calculate out an estimated salary to use for your budget. 4) Here is the average:   Sr. $4,961  Spec $3,964  Staff $3,026  Sr. Clrk $2,548  Clerk $2,264  Asst $3,162  Your list would look something like this:   Assistant Average  Clerk  Very High  Sr. Clerk Low  Specialist Low to Average  Specialist Average  Sr. Specialist Average to High  Analyst  (They are all allocated at the same amount)  You can , however, use the exact amounts if you have them.  It's up to you.  Next Item - TRAINING!!!  Here's what you can do:  1) List your staff and the type of class they need 2) If you don't know the exact class you want to send them to, then list what  type  of class - for example personal enrichment (i.e. Time Management) or  Technical (Derivatives or Applied Finance or Wellhead to Burnertip) 3) The personal enrichment classes cost aroung $500-$700 4) The technical classes cost aroung $800 - $1000. 5) Just list the type of class, and I'll do the rest.  Next Item - Headhunters!  Try 20% of the new hires salary for their fees.   Other Stuff - I have made a list of all of the unusual items we do during the  year that people forget about at budget time (i.e. flowers for secretaries day, birthday ice cream, offsite meeting costs, customer gifts).  If you forget these  items, I will make sure it is added to your budget.   Once I put all of your budget information into the spreadsheets, we will  review them so that they can be adjusted as necessary and you can approve them.Hopefully  this helps you some.

"Daren--  I know you're busy with bid week, so here are a couple questions & comments  for you:  September I need to know if a ticket has been set up for September for the market side  of the Williams & Apache gas.  We still only the supply is in MOPS.  If it  just needs points added to it, just let me know the deal ticket #.  August 31st This was the day we scheduled the payback to our two transport contracts on  Lonestar  1023 & 1460.  Currently, they do not have the supply points needed  for the Williams & Apache gas in order for the gas to be pathed to  imbalance...so I will get them added so this gas can be pathed.    July 31 - Aug 7 These days were pathed as buy/sells from Tenaska IV to Tenaska Marketing  Ventures.  I worked with volume management to get these out in time for payment (July &  Aug business), and had them do a manual entry for Aug 31st.   Please let me know what you think when you get a chance.

"Daren: I am having trouble with 8/00.  The first issue is day 1 of the purchase at  Fuels Cotton.  We have two deals in Sitara, spot deal 348951 and exchange  deal 157288.  You had said previously that we would know a spot deal had  occurred by the new deal ticket and the different pricing.  Since there was a  spot deal, we put all of the volume for day 1 on deal 348951.  Duke says that  day 1 was not a spot and that it should be on the exchange deal and priced at  GD - 0.10.  The exchange deal is currently price at index - 0.05.  Please let  me know which deal we are suppose to use and what the price should be.   The second issue is the sale volume on deal 157278 for 8/00.  Duke is telling  me that we sold them a batch of gas on the 7th, which we see, but that we are  suppose to prorate the gas over the 5th, 6th, and 7th for the exchange.  This  is a problem since gas was not confirmed for the 5th and 6th and pipeline  shows all of the gas on the 7th.  This is a daily swing meter which  electronically feeds into settlements.

You had said previously that we would know a spot deal had  occurred by the new deal ticket and the different pricing.

Duke is telling  me that we sold them a batch of gas on the 7th, which we see, but that we are  suppose to prorate the gas over the 5th, 6th, and 7th for the exchange.  This  is a problem since gas was not confirmed for the 5th and 6th and pipeline  shows all of the gas on the 7th.  This is a daily swing meter which  electronically feeds into settlements.

All of our pathing for June of 1999 was in  Autonoms and it's not y2K compatabile. With the volumes involved being so  small and the accuracy of the data at Enerfin in question, why don't we let  this volume hit the new OBA at Enerfin as a PPA???  I welcome your thoughts.

Exxon's issue is that  the residue volumes that HPL is recording for Exxon's account for  transportation do not equal to the wellhead volumes produced and delivered to  PGE.     Items that were identified so that Exxon's Issue could be resolved:   1.  HPL is responsible for any UA4 loss/gain and fuel consumed on PGE's line  attributable to Exxon's Big Sandy production.  2.  If Exxon's production exceeds 500 mcf/d, HPL must on a monthly basis  elect to process or not process the Exxon Big Sandy Gas.  If HPL elects  to       process, then Teco buys the products from HPL.  3.  If Exxon's production flows between 100 Mcf/d and 499 Mcf/d, then Teco  can process and makeup the shrinkage to HPL with their own gas volumes.   4.  If Exxon's production is less than 100 Mcf/d, then HPL must terminate  the Processing Agreement.  If HPL does not terminate and volume continue  to        flow at less that 100 Mcf/d than HPL loses the shrinkage and must  pay to Teco an additional $500 per month.  Solution:  1.  HPL will schedule and record the Gain/Loss Volumes at HPL Meter #986884  that is attributable to UA4 and Fuel on the PGE line.  2.  HPL will schedule and record the sale volumes of PVR to Teco at HPL  Meter #986884.   3.  The scheduling of the volumes for items  1 and 2 will allow for offset  volumes to be record as adjustments to Exxon's transport volumes.  4.  The HPL Logistics dept. (Mary Poorman) will inform Assets Group (Jack  Simunek) when and if the volumes nominated for Exxon fall below 100 Mcf/d.

Exxon's issue is that  the residue volumes that HPL is recording for Exxon's account for  transportation do not equal to the wellhead volumes produced and delivered to  PGE.     Items that were identified so that Exxon's Issue could be resolved:   1.  HPL is responsible for any UA4 loss/gain and fuel consumed on PGE's line  attributable to Exxon's Big Sandy production.  2.  If Exxon's production exceeds 500 mcf/d, HPL must on a monthly basis  elect to process or not process the Exxon Big Sandy Gas.  If HPL elects  to       process, then Teco buys the products from HPL.  3.  If Exxon's production flows between 100 Mcf/d and 499 Mcf/d, then Teco  can process and makeup the shrinkage to HPL with their own gas volumes.   4.  If Exxon's production is less than 100 Mcf/d, then HPL must terminate  the Processing Agreement.  If HPL does not terminate and volume continue  to        flow at less that 100 Mcf/d than HPL loses the shrinkage and must  pay to Teco an additional $500 per month.  Solution:  1.  HPL will schedule and record the Gain/Loss Volumes at HPL Meter #986884  that is attributable to UA4 and Fuel on the PGE line.  2.  HPL will schedule and record the sale volumes of PVR to Teco at HPL  Meter #986884.   3.  The scheduling of the volumes for items  1 and 2 will allow for offset  volumes to be record as adjustments to Exxon's transport volumes.  4.  The HPL Logistics dept. (Mary Poorman) will inform Assets Group (Jack  Simunek) when and if the volumes nominated for Exxon fall below 100 Mcf/d.

Although I have not gotten very far in my transition off of Unify and onto  Sitara and TDS, we do see some potential for this happening again towards the  end of this month and the beginning of next month.  The problem with managing positions is a combination of sheer deal counts,  along with updates to those deals.  A large portion of these updates come to  Sitara via the Unify Bridge Back process.  It would be ideal if we could  continue to have the Unify data ""cleaned/scrubbed"" week to week and try to  avoid having the bulk of the month being updated/bridged in the final  week/days of the month.  I know this is the goal of Logistics, but I just  want to help reinforce that goal due to the performance impact it can have on  the Gas Trading systems.  Perhaps a few extra pair of eyes on the Pipeline  Exception Summary and the Bridge Back Pipeline Summary in Unify this month  would help.  Another area that causes these transaction counts to increase is the need to  have 2 months ""active"" at a time.  In other words, when November is over and  we are in the first week or two of December, Sitara continues to maintain  positions for November.  This November data degrades the ability to update  December positions in a timely manner.  We may find ourselves having to  remove the November deals from the Sitara positions sooner than we have in  the past.  I will be trying to work with the Sitara team in the coming days/weeks to  implement some combination of quick fixes, as well as look into the long term  changes necessary to support our increased trading business.  Please let me know if you have any questions or comments in this area.  Thanks, d.n.

"With PMA's, volumes can be adjusted through the system as usual and I can  adjust the demand fee on the Sitara ticket.  I am not able to follow your ua4  calculation.  However, there was imbalance payback that occurred throughout  September and October.  (This should have been pathed to the Lone Star  transport k in Unify).  Is this in that ua4 number?  Williams had been trying  to make up volumes from prior periods, so that's probably why their volume  came in greater than booked.  (Much of their gas is from El Paso and volumes  vary each day from scheduled.)  The volumes that they were trying to make up  would go toward the transport imbalance also.  I would think that Cleburne  will carry an imbalance on Lone Star from month to month.  After Novemeber,  the imbalance should be fairly small.  Our scheduler, Mark McCoy will have  that number.  (When we took over this deal, the imbalance on Lone Star was  very large.   When the plant went down in Sep, we decided to payback the  imbalance then, so that we could take advantage of higher winter sales prices  if the opportunity came up.)  The agreement does not specifically state anything about ua4.  But, I will  discuss that with Legal.  The intent is for all costs, including ua4 and  fuel, to be covered by Tenaska IV.

We actually owe $1,798,389.73, but I need to  net the Tenaska IV sales with the purchase to clear those receivables.  James  is calling me every day asking for an update.  Do you know when we will be  able to get this in the system?  I have attached my spreadsheet so you can  see the numbers.

"Daren, per review of the Gas agreements between Tenaska IV and  Williams/Apache and our understanding of the Agency agreement, I had a few  items I  wanted to discuss with you (in lieu of our meeting today that was  cancelled):  1. Looking at the October gas supply to the plant, I think Tenaska IV should  have been charged at the contract prices with Williams & Apache (i.e.  2.285)  and not at what the final price that was actualized per Megan's summary -  230,406 at $710,616.70, price of $3.084.  If this volume was charged  at  2.285 the total would have been $526,477.71, a difference of $184,138.99.  2. Looking at the November gas supply to the plant, Tenaska IV was charged  $2.91 per MMbtu, instead of $2.285 for volumes of 267,300.  At the $2.91   price, the total settlement price was $777,843 instead of $610,780.50 at  2.285, showing a difference of $167,062.50.  I reviewed the gas supply agreements and the Williams gas price (pg. 19) for  2000 gas is 2.32, which can be adjusted by the Waha Transportation Adjustment  if delivered at Waha.  This adjustment started in 1997 at $.03 per MMbtu and  increase by 5% per year.  Thereby currently, the adjustment factor is at  .0347, giving us a price of $2.2853 per MMbtu.  In reviewing the Apache gas agreement (pg. 22), I noticed that the gas price  is 2.285 at Waha & 2.315 at Katy/Carthage for 2000.  Per review of the Apache  invoices, it appears that we are not getting our gas at these points but at  other places (i.e. Lomak-Sterling & Mendell CDP) at a price of $2.175.  If  Enron has a separate agreement at these delivery points and can capture a  margin difference then that is upside to Enron.  However, I think the plant  should not be charged above the contract price of $2.285.  Looking at the daily gas that was scheduled to the plant for November and  October, I did not see that their use went over the contracted volumes from  Williams and Apache of 45,000 MMbtu per day.  Therefore I don't think spot  prices are part of the equation here.  Additionally, I recall from our  meeting last month that all Enron makes on this deal is the Agency Fee of  $.04 per MMbtu (excluding the margin difference that Enron has on Apache gas  delivery points if my scenario above is correct).  So based upon items 1 & 2 above, I am suggesting that Tenaska IV adjust their  November invoice owed to Enron for gas used by the plant by the gas price  differences showed above.  Therefore, I am planning to wire a payment of  $484,234.03 (see breakout below) on Friday, 12/22, to Enron on behalf of  Tenaska IV Texas Partners, Ltd. for this activity.    Month   Plant Gas Price Amount   November  267,300  2.91 $777,843    November adjustment    $(167,062.50)      October adjustment    $(184,138.99)   Nov. Agency Fee 1,350,000 .04 $54,000   Sept. Agency Fee 98,813  .04 $3,592.52        Total $484,234.03  I discussed these issues with Mike Mazowita, Rick Hill & Jody Pierce before  reaching this conclusion.  Should you have any different ideas or thoughts  that I am not covering, please call me at 3-7280 and we can discuss.  Thanks.

"I think we need to remove some of the demand charges that have been set up  for Williams and Apache.  On Williams deal 384237, the demand charge needs to  be removed from Sept. 2000.  The demand charge should not have started until  October 2000.   Because we did not know at the time what was happening with  this deal, the demand fee was inadvertently paid to Williams for Sept. and we  need to recoup our money.  On Apache deal 384247, James thinks we need to  remove the demand charge completely.  He says it is not a part of the deal  and Apache is not billing us for it.  We also need to talk about the pricing  on both of these deals.  Williams and Apache are billing us less than what we  have in Sitara.  To be able to keep this desk at zero, Jim Pond does not want  me to use pay the lesser of  for the purchases, so we need to address the  price differences.   You said you had some contract briefs that supported our  prices.  Please fax a copy to me at 713-646-8420 and I will compare them to  what James has.  Just a heads up...We are beginning to work on November 2000, so we will need  a demand fee entered (hopefully next week).

Megan ---------------------- Forwarded by Megan Parker/Corp/Enron on 12/29/2000  11:46 AM ---------------------------   James Armstrong@ECT 12/19/2000 10:31 AM To: Daren J Farmer/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: Megan Parker/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Jody Pierce/HOU/ECT@ECT, Mike  Mazowita/Corp/Enron@Enron, Garrick Hill/HOU/ECT@ECT   Subject: Tenaska IV Gas  Daren, per review of the Gas agreements between Tenaska IV and  Williams/Apache and our understanding of the Agency agreement, I had a few  items I  wanted to discuss with you (in lieu of our meeting today that was  cancelled):  1. Looking at the October gas supply to the plant, I think Tenaska IV should  have been charged at the contract prices with Williams & Apache (i.e.  2.285)  and not at what the final price that was actualized per Megan's summary -  230,406 at $710,616.70, price of $3.084.  If this volume was charged  at  2.285 the total would have been $526,477.71, a difference of $184,138.99.  2. Looking at the November gas supply to the plant, Tenaska IV was charged  $2.91 per MMbtu, instead of $2.285 for volumes of 267,300.  At the $2.91   price, the total settlement price was $777,843 instead of $610,780.50 at  2.285, showing a difference of $167,062.50.  I reviewed the gas supply agreements and the Williams gas price (pg. 19) for  2000 gas is 2.32, which can be adjusted by the Waha Transportation Adjustment  if delivered at Waha.  This adjustment started in 1997 at $.03 per MMbtu and  increase by 5% per year.  Thereby currently, the adjustment factor is at  .0347, giving us a price of $2.2853 per MMbtu.  In reviewing the Apache gas agreement (pg. 22), I noticed that the gas price  is 2.285 at Waha & 2.315 at Katy/Carthage for 2000.  Per review of the Apache  invoices, it appears that we are not getting our gas at these points but at  other places (i.e. Lomak-Sterling & Mendell CDP) at a price of $2.175.  If  Enron has a separate agreement at these delivery points and can capture a  margin difference then that is upside to Enron.  However, I think the plant  should not be charged above the contract price of $2.285.  Looking at the daily gas that was scheduled to the plant for November and  October, I did not see that their use went over the contracted volumes from  Williams and Apache of 45,000 MMbtu per day.  Therefore I don't think spot  prices are part of the equation here.  Additionally, I recall from our  meeting last month that all Enron makes on this deal is the Agency Fee of  $.04 per MMbtu (excluding the margin difference that Enron has on Apache gas  delivery points if my scenario above is correct).  So based upon items 1 & 2 above, I am suggesting that Tenaska IV adjust their  November invoice owed to Enron for gas used by the plant by the gas price  differences showed above.  Therefore, I am planning to wire a payment of  $484,234.03 (see breakout below) on Friday, 12/22, to Enron on behalf of  Tenaska IV Texas Partners, Ltd. for this activity.

"Daren:  During the month of September and October 2000, gas flowed into HPL's  pipeline at the above meter that is owned by Duke Energy Trading and  Marketing, LLC.  Prior to September 2000, the gas was purchased under  contract #960439646, and Deal #133196 that expired on 8/31/2000.  Effective  11/1/2000, the gas was again purchased from Duke under Contract #96021934;  Deal #466305, but this deal expires on 11/30/2000.   Currently, Logistic has September and October 2000 volumes recorded to HPL  Strangers Gas Contract.  In order to correct this, HPL Logistics needs either  (1) Deals #133196 or #466305 extended to cover September and October 2000,  (2) a new deal to cover September and October 2000, or (3) Logistics needs  approval to write-off these volumes to Unaccounted for Gas Loss.

On Saturday, 01/20/01, EIM is having a Super Saturday to  recruit experienced Commercial Support personnel to fill many of our  vacancies.  Unfortunately, we don't have enough personnel to do the  interviewing.  To round out the Logistics team, I am looking for one more  interviewer.  The current team is Roy Lipsett, Dan Hamilton and Del Davis.   Both Dan and Del are new to Enron (Del started 1/8 and Dan is still  transitioning his prior job and moving to Houston), but bring a wealth of  Logistics experience for our industries.  I would love to have one additional  team member to provide input from the Enron perspective.  Will this candidate  fit into the expectations of Enron?  Will the candidate compete when compared  to their peers.  Unfortunately, Logistics candidates below Manager have been  difficult to find from the industry.  There seems to be a tendancy towards  clerical skill sets but compensation at a Specialist level.  Consequently, I  have been cautious around these candidates as I would not want to set them up  to fail.  I know the sacrifice of a Saturday, but I would value the input that any one  of you might offer.  We do expect it to be a full day commitment as we have  several candidates, and we will have a follow-up evaluation session.  I know  I can't adequately compensate you for your day, but I would be happy to buy  you a dinner for two.  Please let me know ASAP.  Assuming worst case that noe  of you are available, I would welcome other suggestions.  In advance, I appreciate your help.

"Bob,   I didn't check voice mail until this morning (I don't have a blinking light.   The assistants pick up our lines and amtel us when voice mails have been  left.)  Anyway, with the uncertainty of the future business under the Texas  Desk, the following are my goals for the next six months:  1)  Ensure a smooth transition of HPL to AEP, with minimal upsets to Texas  business. 2)  Develop operations processes and controls for the new Texas Desk.    3)  Develop a replacement  a.  Strong push to improve Liz (if she remains with Enron and )  b.  Hire new person, internally or externally 4)  Assist in develop a strong logisitcs team.  With the new business, we  will need strong performers who know and accept their responsibilites.  1 and 2 are open-ended.  How I accomplish these goals and what they entail  will depend how the Texas Desk (if we have one) is set up and what type of  activity the desk will be invovled in, which is unknown to me at this time.   I'm sure as we get further into the finalization of the sale, additional and  possibly more urgent goals will develop.  So, in short, who knows what I need  to do.

"To forecast Entex:  We have a database that contains the citygate volumes by day, with the low  and high temps for each day.  When we get a weather report for the new day,  we enter the projected low temp and the spread into the file.  The database  is sorted by that information with a +/- 2 degrees on the temps, and provides  an average volume for that criteria.  (For example:  With temps of 40-60, the  sort would produce a list of the volumes pulled for each day with a low of 38  to 42 degrees and a temperature spread of 20 to 22 degrees.  An average is  then calculated from that volumetric data.  In this case, the average is  calculated to 259,000 Mmbtu.)  Upon calculating the average, we then apply  information we obtain through daily business and adjust that estimate.   Things to consider:  if weather is cloudy or sunny, wet or dry;  wind chill;   Entex's obligation on Midcon;  Entex's recent operating procedures;  Entex  takes versus our prior estimates (have we been under or overestimating  volumes each day), etc.  Additionally, since we only see about 30% of the meters, we apply a factor to  estimate the remaining 70%.  If we have an unaccounted volume for a few days  that is fairly consistent (and we have determined that the ua4 has not been  caused by something else), we may adjust the factor to bring the estimates  more in line.  Let me know if you have any questions.  Daren ",jvobergfell@aep.com,daren.farmer@enron.com,Entex Forecasting,2001-02-02 08:06:00-08:00,sent

We are being asked, as a requirement, to not display the EOL id on statements  that are identified as ""Broker EOL trade"" deals originating from EOL.  We  have two options to accomodate this requirement:  Option 1 is to have the modify the bridge code to not bridge over the EOL  deal id if the deal is a ""Broker EOL trade""  deal.  One of the drawbacks of  this option is that you won't be able to referenence the EOL id on the Path  Manager for these related deals.  All other deals will have the EOL deal id,  if applicable.  The EOL id would not show up on the statements because it  wouldn't be populated.  Option 2 is to modify several areas of code in the Settlements area which may  be more time consuming.  The obvious code change would be in the statement  generation area as well as other report type information.    Option 2 allows you the greatest flexibility while Option 1 may be quicker to  implement.    Please pass this along to others in your group and get feedback.  Please  share your thoughts.... I've attached an email explaining the Broker EOL trades.  This is not to be  confused with Broker deals done at a given point with not transportation.   These will continue to come across as you'd normally expect.  Any questions, please ask...  Thanks!

I was forwarded this  poem, and told it was written by a high school student in Az.  Regardless, of who/where (not the point) I find it interesting, weirdly  amusing, and frighteningly fairly accurate.- PB   Now I sit me down in school  Where praying is against the rule  For this great nation under God  Finds mention of Him very odd.   If Scripture now the class recites,  It violates the Bill of Rights.  And anytime my head I bow  Becomes a Federal matter now.   Our hair can be purple, orange or green,  That's no offense, it's a freedom scene.  The law is specific, the law is precise.  Prayers spoken aloud are a serious vice.   For praying in a public hall  Might offend someone with no faith at all.  In silence alone we must meditate,  God's name is prohibited by the state.   We're allowed to cuss and dress like freaks,  And pierce our noses, tongues and cheeks.  They've outlawed guns, but FIRST the Bible.  To quote the Good Book makes me liable.   We can elect a pregnant Senior Queen,  And the 'unwed daddy,' our Senior King.  It's ""inappropriate"" to teach right from wrong,  We're taught that such ""judgments"" do not belong.   We can get our condoms and birth controls,  Study witchcraft, vampires and totem poles.  But the Ten Commandments are not allowed,  No word of God must reach this crowd.   It's scary here I must confess,  When chaos reigns the school's a mess.  So, Lord, this silent plea I make,  Should I be shot; My soul please take!

"Daren:  Sorry it has taken so long to get back to this issue, I am with EES now.   Karen Lindley allocates this point but I feel the need to help her because  this issue came to light while I was in transition.  Exxon allocates this point and we receive a allocation statement from them on  a monthly basis.  December 2000 The total flow at the meter was 646 MMBtu.  I copied Esther Garcia on this  e-mail so that she can look into the possibility that there is a measurement  error.  Esther will need to respond to Karen on the matter of the possible  measurement error.  Furthermore it seems odd to me that scheduling had 8,928  MMBtu confirmed at this point and only 646 MMBtu flowed.  I would ask Mark  where he got his confirmed volumes from.  As a temporary fix I reallocated  the meter and gave the total flow to Alpine Resources.  They will be short  paid in their minds until Ester and Karen can get the possible measurement  error issue resolved.  I would also suggest that Mark and Karen get together  to review the scheduling of this point so that Karen can call Exxon to  reconcile their allocation with what we have (the additional Alpine deal) at  this point.  Charlene can redraft her invoice on Monday 2/26/01 that will  show the 646 MMBtu going to Alpine.  January 2001 Again scheduling has 9,193 confirmed at this meter when on 3,241 MMBtu  flowed.  I temporarily reallocated the meter so that the entire volume that  flowed went to Alpine.  They remain 10 MMBtu short paid but Charlene can  redraft her invoice and pay them something until Mark (validity of other  deals at this point) and Karen (Exxon's allocation of this point) can get  this issue resolved.  There is also the issue with the Exxon transport at this point that was  scheduled at 1,500 MMBtu per month for the months in question.  This  transport affects the allocation at the King Ranch tailgate on the Exxon 024  contract.  I copied Howard Camp who will be training the contractor that will  take my place in Volume Management so that he can stay on top of the  resolution of this issue.

"Well, the staff level is prettly low here, for just about every group related  to HPL.  Stacey did leave, so I am back to trading Waha.  However, it's going  a lot better this time.  I am actualy enjoying it somewhat.  With the  majority of the desk leaving, I am looking into moving into the day trading  arena for the new Texas Desk.  We'll see how that goes.  Bidweek was kinda  rough this time.  In addition to Stacey leaving during the middle of the  week, we have some major outages on the A/S line where we have to stay  balanced on Texoma and balanced on the south end.  The line has been split  into two seperate systems.  Handling that has been a constant battle.  Plus,  with the pending sale, people just don't care as much about the business.   It's a little harder to get things done.  Anyway, things are going pretty good at the house.  But, the list of things  to fix and do keeps getting longer and longer.  We are extremely busy.  The  kids are loving the stairs.  You ought to see Jake go down.  We taught him to  turn around backwards and crawl down the stairs on his belly.  Well, that was  too slow for him.  Now, he get's on his belly, feet up in the air, and slides  down, barely skiming the stairs.  He looks a penguin sliding down a snow  bank, except on his stomach.  Cole is doing his best to either run Jake off  or make him tough.  Cole runs over Jake with his toys, pushes Jake out the  way, or just walks right over him.  It doesn't affect Jake, though, he gets  right back up and keeps on going.  Anyway, I need to get back to work.  Hope the family is doing well.  Maybe  you can come down for lunch next week.

"Well, the staff level is prettly low here, for just about every group related to HPL.  Stacey did leave, so I am back to trading Waha.  However, it's going a lot better this time.  I am actualy enjoying it somewhat.  With the majority of the desk leaving, I am looking into moving into the day trading arena for the new Texas Desk.  We'll see how that goes.  Bidweek was kinda rough this time.  In addition to Stacey leaving during the middle of the week, we have some major outages on the A/S line where we have to stay balanced on Texoma and balanced on the south end.  The line has been split into two seperate systems.  Handling that has been a constant battle.  Plus, with the pending sale, people just don't care as much about the business.  It's a little harder to get things done.  Anyway, things are going pretty good at the house.  But, the list of things to fix and do keeps getting longer and longer.  We are extremely busy.  The kids are loving the stairs.  You ought to see Jake go down.  We taught him to turn around backwards and crawl down the stairs on his belly.  Well, that was too slow for him.  Now, he get's on his belly, feet up in the air, and slides down, barely skiming the stairs.  He looks a penguin sliding down a snow bank, except on his stomach.  Cole is doing his best to either run Jake off or make him tough.  Cole runs over Jake with his toys, pushes Jake out the way, or just walks right over him.  It doesn't affect Jake, though, he gets right back up and keeps on going.  Anyway, I need to get back to work.  Hope the family is doing well.  Maybe you can come down for lunch next week.  I'll give you a call in the next couple of days.
