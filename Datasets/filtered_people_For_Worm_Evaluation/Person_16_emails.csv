Tuesday, May 30    Mock draft No. 1: Mihm's the word     ?                        ? By Andy Katz  ESPN.com    With the number of impact players available in the NBA draft somewhere  between few and none, this year's selections will be based on the potential  of the underclassmen and the needs of the teams.    NBA scouts, general managers and player personnel directors are banking  heavily on impressions made at private workouts and the Chicago pre-draft  camp June 6-9. Because so many players are relatively close in terms of  talent and opinions could change almost daily, this is the first of several  projections we'll have on ESPN.com.    A number of players still have work to do to earn first-round spots, but  could easily sneak back on with impressive workouts and/or a strong showing  in Chicago.    The borderline first-rounders who didn't make ESPN.com's list but have a  chance to move up are UCLA sophomore forward JaRon Rush, LSU senior center  Jabari Smith, Temple junior guard Mark Karcher, UCLA freshman guard Jason  Kapono, Purdue senior forward Brian Cardinal, Connecticut junior point guard  Khalid El-Amin, Indiana senior guard A.J. Guyton, Ohio State senior point  guard Scoonie Penn, Northern Arizona senior center Dan McClintock, Ohio State  junior guard Michael Redd, Penn State senior center Jarrett Stephens, Turkey  forward Hidayet Turkoglu and Nigerian forward Olumide Oyediji.    Any of these players could crack the bottom third of the draft over the next  month. The problem for underclassmen such as Kapono and Karcher is they must  decide if it's worth the risk to stay in the draft. Underclassmen have until  June 21 to pull their name out and still return to school. Rush, El-Amin and  Redd have all said they plan on staying in the draft, regardless of what  happens.    ESPN.com checked with scouts around the league to get a feel about its mock  draft and came up with these 29 selections for the week of May 22.          Chris Mihm    Mihm towered over much of the competition in college.    1. New Jersey -- Chris Mihm, 7-0, Jr., Texas: The Nets need a center and  could go with Mihm or Kenyon Martin, but the pick here is Mihm. The Nets  could either hold on to the pick and see if Jayson Williams plays next  season, or deal it to the Bulls for the No. 4 and No. 7 picks.    2. Vancouver - Kenyon Martin, 6-9, Sr., Cincinnati: The Grizzlies would be  getting a steal by grabbing Martin at No. 2. He's the hardest-working player  in the draft and, with a healthy leg, the most effective low-post scorer.  Martin could play next to Shareef Abdur-Rahim and Bryant Reeves. If the  Grizzlies aren't ready to go with Martin, he makes for a tantalizing trade.    3. Los Angeles Clippers - Stromile Swift, 6-9, So., LSU: The Clippers have  already inquired about Swift and see him as a potential small/power forward  (which goes against LSU coach John Brady's philosophy of how to use him  defensively). But, if Swift knows he's going to the Clips, he could opt to  return to school. He has said he will not hire an agent, leaving the door  open for a return.    4. Chicago -- Joel Przybilla, 7-0, Soph., Minnesota: The Bulls need a center  for their triangle offense. If they can't trade for Mihm, Przybilla is next  in line. He needs work but he has the skills to develop into a better  offensive product than Luc Longley was during the Bulls' championship runs.    5. Orlando -- Marcus Fizer, 6-8, Jr., Iowa State: The Magic love Darius Miles  but won't let Fizer drop below No. 5 if he's available. Fizer gives the Magic  an inside scorer and a tough presence on the backboard that they lacked last  season. Doc Rivers will fall in love with his work ethic.    6. Atlanta -- Mike Miller, 6-8, Soph., Florida: The Hawks have been high on  Miller for a month and won't let him slide past them. Miles might be a better  scorer but Miller's versatility will win the Hawks over at No. 6. Atlanta  wants a small forward over a big guard.    7. Chicago -- Darius Miles, 6-9, HS, East St. Louis (Ill.): The Bulls can  package Miles and Przybilla to the Nets or keep two players who could be  solid players in the league. Miles might have more of an upside than Tracy  McGrady. Tim Floyd knows all about working with high school seniors and would  have the patience to wait for Miles to develop.    8. Cleveland -- Iakovos Tsakalidis, 7-1, Greece: The Cavs want size and the  third-rated center in the draft is Tsakalidis. The Celtics covet him, too,  but Cleveland might not give them the chance because of the Cavs' need for  size with the uncertainty in their frontcourt. Reviews on Tsakalidis are  split -- either scouts love him or think he's too slow.    9. Houston -- Courtney Alexander, 6-5, Sr., Fresno State: Alexander could go  higher but not above six. The Rockets need scorers and Alexander will produce  during individual workouts. The choice of Alexander, DeShawn Stevenson,  DerMarr Johnson or Morris Peterson is hard to argue. Alexander can rise over  a defense for a jump shot and has a pro game.    10. Orlando -- DeShawn Stevenson, 6-5, HS, Washington Union (Fresno, Calif.):  The Magic will take one of the two high school seniors with one of their  three picks. If Miles is gone, Stevenson will be too by No. 11. Orlando has  scouted him for months and Rivers can afford to let Stevenson mature without  feeling pressured to play him next season.    11. Boston -- DerMarr Johnson, 6-9, Fr., Cincinnati: Johnson can't slip past  11 with his Lamar Odom-like skills on the wing. The Celtics need size but  can't let a scorer get past them in the draft. Johnson learned defense from  Max Good and Bob Huggins, so Rick Pitino's pressure defense shouldn't be much  different.    12. Dallas -- Mamadou N'diaye, 7-0, Sr., Auburn: Trying to predict what Don  Nelson will do is the most difficult thing in this mock draft. But the  Mavericks need athleticism in the frontcourt. They can't afford to go with a  foreigner or a slower big man. N'diaye fits here if he does well in workouts  and in Chicago -- if he shows.    13. Orlando -- Mateen Cleaves, 6-2, Sr., Michigan State: The Magic have to  take a point guard with one of their three picks, but no one is good enough  to spend the No. 5 or No. 10 pick on. Cleaves is at the top of the  point-guard list list -- and would fit Rivers' style of play and coaching  because of his leadership and toughness.    14. Detroit -- Morris Peterson, 6-6, Sr., Michigan State: The Pistons won't  let the local hero leave the state. Peterson gives them a scorer to go next  to or in place of Grant Hill if he leaves via free agency. Peterson could go  higher -- if he's gone, the Pistons will take Alexander or Johnson.    15. Milwaukee -- Etan Thomas, 6-9, Sr., Syracuse: The Bucks want a power  forward and Thomas is fourth on their list behind Martin, Fizer and Swift.  None will be available by the time they pick. Thomas can give them a  rebounder and defender, something they lacked in their playoff losses to the  Pacers.    16. Sacramento -- Erick Barkley, 6-1, Soph., St. John's: The Kings need a  backup point to Jason Williams. Barkley could come in and wouldn't be under  any pressure to perform immediately. He's the No. 2 point guard behind  Cleaves.     17. Seattle -- Quentin Richardson, 6-6, Soph., DePaul: Had Richardson stayed,  he would have probably been in the lottery next season. But he doesn't fit  all of the teams' needs above, which is why he falls all the way to the  Sonics. He gives them another rebounding wing and a scorer to complement  Rashard Lewis, if he re-signs.     18. Los Angeles Clippers -- Keyon Dooling, 6-3, Soph., Missouri: The Clippers  need a point guard but won't take one at No. 3. Dooling has the upside that  some of the senior points don't carry into the draft. But the potential of  being a mid-teens draft pick may scare Dooling into returning to school.    19. Charlotte -- Jerome Moiso, 6-10, Soph., UCLA: Moiso could still slide up  into the late lottery (maybe to Dallas) but if he falls, the Hornets will  catch him. Moiso can play power forward or center for the Hornets because of  his ability to block shots and score from 12 feet in to the basket. The  Hornets could use a frontcourt player or shooting guard in this draft.    20. Philadelphia -- Jamal Crawford, 6-6, Fr., Michigan: The Sixers have  already called on Crawford's behalf and love him as a combo guard to come off  the bench. Crawford would likely stay in the draft if he's in the first  round, regardless of where he's being picked.    21. Toronto -- Craig ""Speedy"" Claxton, 5-11, Sr., Hofstra: The Raptors have  already begun working out point guards and have Claxton in their top five. If  Cleaves, Barkley, Dooling and Crawford are all gone, Claxton is the natural  pick for the Raptors.    22. New York -- Jamaal Magloire, 6-11, Sr., Kentucky: The Knicks took some  heat for taking Frederic Weis last year. Jeff Van Gundy wants tough, physical  players. Magloire gets the nod over Jason Collier if the Knicks go big.  Magloire proved this season that he can play with passion in the post.    23. Utah -- Hanno M""tt""l,, 6-9, Sr., Utah: The Jazz can't go wrong with  picking M""tt""l, from nearby Utah. He can score from the wing, but he'll end  up playing more inside because of his defensive limitations as a small  forward. If M""tt""l, doesn't go to the Jazz, he could slip out of the first  round.    24. Chicago -- Jeryl Sasser, 6-7, Jr., SMU: The Bulls have to find a point  guard in this draft but can't go after one in the lottery. The most  intriguing point guard left could be Sasser. He can play both guard  positions, he's one of the better defenders in the draft and would give the  Bulls some versatility on the floor.    25. Phoenix -- Jason Collier, 7-0, Sr., Georgia Tech: The Suns need another  big guy to go with Luc Longley -- either as a backup, or on the floor  together. Collier has more offensive potential than many big men. The Suns  have the luxury to allow Collier a few years to develop into a NBA center.    26. Utah -- Chris Carrawell, 6-6, Sr., Duke: The Jazz need to add athleticism  and fresh legs, either with Carrawell or Oklahoma State's Desmond Mason.  Carrawell will probably get the nod because of his Duke pedigree. He could  still go higher but his 'tweener status fits more as a late first-round pick.    27. Indiana -- Donnell Harvey, 6-8, Fr., Florida: Harvey is getting rave  reviews for his work ethic in workouts, and he didn't leave school early  without some sort of assurance he could go in the first round. The Pacers  have a history of going younger in the draft.    28. Portland -- Soumaila Samake, 7-2, Cincinnati Stuff (IBL): The Blazers  don't need much but could go with a wacky pick by taking the first player to  jump from the fledgling IBL to the NBA. Samake has the size, shot-blocking  skills and potential to be an NBA center. Arvydas Sabonis doesn't have many  miles left in his legs.    29. Los Angeles Lakers -- Desmond Mason, 6-6, Sr., Oklahoma State: Here's  where any one of the bubble players could go, such as Rush, Karcher or  Stephens. But Mason is a more polished, experienced player. He gives the  Lakers an athlete on the wing who would fit in well in their system.    Andy Katz is a senior writer at ESPN.com.     ?

"---------------------- Forwarded by Phillip K Allen/HOU/ECT on 06/12/2000  10:55 AM ---------------------------          From:  Tim Belden                           06/11/2000 07:26 PM    To: Phillip K Allen/HOU/ECT@ECT cc:   Subject: Thoughts on Presentation  It is a shame that the CAISO doesn't provide actual generation by unit.  The  WSCC data, which is dicey and we don't have until July 1999, and the CEMMS,  which comes on a delay, are ultimately our best sources.  For your purposes  the CAISO may suffice.  I think that you probably know this already, but  there can be a siginificant difference between ""scheduled"" and ""actual""  generation.  You are pulling ""scheduled.""  If someone doesn't schedule their  generation and then generates, either instructed or uninstructed, then you  will miss that.  You may also miss generation of the northern california  munis such as smud who only schedule their net load to the caiso.  That is,  if they have 1500 MW of load and 1200 MW of generation, they may simply  schedule 300 MW of load and sc transfers or imports of 300 MW.  Having said  all of that, it is probably close enough and better than your alternatives on  the generation side.  On the load side I think that I would simply use CAISO actual load.  While  they don't split out NP15 from SP15, I think that using the actual number is  better than the ""scheduled"" number.  The utilities play lots of game on the  load side, usually under-scheduling depending on price.  I think the presentation looks good.  It would be useful to share this with  others up here once you have it finished.  I'd like to see how much gas  demand goes up with each additional GW of gas-generated electricity,  especially compared to all gas consumption.  I was surprised by how small the  UEG consumption was compared to other uses.  If it is the largest marginal  consumer then it is obviously a different story.  Let's talk.

A preview of next season's MNF call:   -------------------- AL MICHAELS: Hello and welcome to another edition of ABC's Monday Night Football, tonight broadcasting from beautiful Fed Ex Field in Washington, D.C. I'm Al Michaels, and joining me in the booth are two new members of the ABC family, Dennis Miller and Dan Fouts.  DENNIS MILLER: Wow, Monday Night Football. I don't want to appear nervous, but I'm under more strain right now than Linda Tripp's capri pants. I have to tell you, I'm conflicted about this. I usually like to be the outsider, the rabble-rouser, the iconoclast, but I also like a nice seat at a sporting event. And this seat is as nice as they get - except I think I took one of Boomer's old squeak toys up the *** when I sat down. DAN FOUTS: I was a quarterback. MILLER: Thanks for that insight, Mr. Peabody. Dan Fouts, everyone. I'm looking over here, and he's giving me that same blank stare I see when I put my dog on the phone. Hey, this isn't the Senior Tour, Chi Chi. Try to keep up. MICHAELS: Tonight the New England Patriots will try to get started on the right foot after a disappointing 8-8 showing last season. They take on the Washington Redskins, whose owner, Daniel Snyder, has paid out $65 million in free agent salaries and bonus payments in the offseason and is looking for results. MILLER: Snyder is throwing around cash like a screech monkey playing with a pop-up Kleenex dispenser. But he's a real hard-*** - it must be great to coach this team. Norv Turner comes to work every day, hands his balls to Gus, the 80-year-old equipment guy, who puts them in a footlocker behind the Stairmaster until the end of the game. Did you catch that one *** -chewing Turner received last season? Lee Harvey Oswald got off easier in that little room at the Dallas P.D. And when Turner finally got out of there you could tell he was looking around, desperately praying for Jack Ruby to show up and end his ****ing misery. MICHAELS: The teams are on the field, and we're almost set for the kickoff. FOUTS: I was the quarterback. I didn't go on the field for the kickoff. MILLER: Jesus, Shaggy, saunter on back to the Mystery Machine and take a breather, OK? Why don't you pick up your brain off that pile of papers it's holding down and see what happens when you plug it in? The game's starting, and I feel like Corporal Agarn trying to explain supply and demand to the ****ing Hakowis. MICHAELS: As always, the Fuji Blimp makes its annual appearance at Monday Night Football. Glad to have you back, gentlemen. MILLER: It is balloooooooooon! (high-pitched cackle). MICHAELS: Starting at quarterback for the Redskins will be Jeff George, whom I guess one could call a journeyman at this point in his career. MILLER: I have to admit, when I saw George on the roster I thought he had as much chance of making the team as Linda Hunt on the set of Baywatch. This guy's been around - he's called a lot of plays under a lot of centers. He's seen more giant asses than a guest chair on the Jerry Springer Show. MICHAELS: Snyder spent plenty in the offseason to sign star players such as Deion Sanders and Darrell Green on defense. MILLER: Yeah, but look at that Fantasia broom army of social misfits the Redskins call an offensive line. I have a feeling that George's appearance tonight is going to be shorter than Mini-Me stooping over to pick up one of Dr. Evil's monocles. MICHAELS: George drops back to pass, moves out of the pocket and finds the veteran Michael Westbrook, who is tackled after an 11-yard gain. MILLER: Look, I'm new, I don't know that much about defensive schemes. But it seems to me right there that the middle was as vacant as an interview with Posh Spice. FOUTS: I was in a Miller beer commercial, and your last name is Miller. MILLER: Hey, Aristotle, save some of the probing insight for the rest of us, OK? How come I'm getting the funny feeling that this is an episode of The Munsters, and I'm Marian, the normal one? Now, I don't want to get off on a rant here, but the useful comments coming from your side of the booth could be counted on the one hand of a bad wood shop teacher. I can still see the jelly on your forehead where the electroshock terminals were attached. When I took this job, they didn't tell me that I would be teamed with Pepe the Human Hamster on one side, and on the other a broken-down ex-quarterback who makes Jethro Bodine look like David Niven. I want to find the psychotic network programmers who thought up this train wreck and point out that this **** has to be harder to watch than a sausage being made. FOUTS: I like sausage. MILLER: Ah **** it, where's my propeller hat? MICHAELS: The handoff is to Stephen Davis, who is tackled at the 39-yard line by defensive tackle Henry Thomas. But there's a flag on the play. MILLER: I'd have to say that was the poorest result since O.J. took the lie-detector test. And look at that ref, will ya? He's got more nervous tics than a Belfast valet. MICHAELS: That play will be brought back, making it first and 20 from the 49-yard line. MILLER: Hey, who took my Raisinettes? Damn you, Roone Arledge! Damn you to hell! MICHAELS: George back to pass ... and the throw to Westbrook falls incomplete. Ty Law covering on the play. MILLER: I don't want to be a downer here, but how about throwin' the freakin' ball to the other side of the field, you know, cha-cha? You've got Westbrook drawing a bigger crowd than Anna Kournikova at the maximum-security lockdown at Rikers, while meanwhile the kid on the other side is lonelier than a hooker at a Star Trek convention. MICHAELS: To be fair, there have only been four plays so far. MILLER: Come on Al, you missing link. That receiver is being shunned like an Amish kid with a nipple ring. The left side of the field is to George as a shower is to the French. You've got a better shot at hearing Charlie Sheen give the keynote address at a Promise Keepers rally than you do of ever - MICHAELS: Sorry to break in on you, Dennis, but Washington is guilty of a false start, and that will set them back another five yards. MILLER: The ref is whipping out that flag like it's the only lighter at a crack house. Later that evening: MICHAELS: So your final score is Washington 17, New England 10. We're headed off to San Francisco for our next Monday night broadcast, hope to see you there. MILLER: I may be late; I don't fly. It'll be me in my Chevy Nova playing Mad Max with the Madden Cruiser all the way down Route 66, and you'll know I'm winning when Pavorotti starts hurling six-legged turkeys out the skylight for ballast. MICHAELS: What will you be doing with your remaining time in Washington, D.C.? FOUTS: Doing a little sightseeing. MILLER: I'll be back at the hotel, masturbating like a red-assed monkey watching the Banana Channel. MICHAELS: So from all of us here at Monday Night Football, see you next week...

As football season creeps ever  closer, the avid enthusiast finds it difficult                                            to contain the unbridled  excitement and anticipation that bubbles like                                            summertime sweat within their  pigskin-thirsty souls. Football season is                                            that special time of year that not  only means the beginning of another                                            healthy slate of competitive  gridiron contests filled with spectacular plays                                            and high drama--it's also the  definitive rallying point for the onslaught of                                            all the expected pomp, pageantry,  and circumstance that goes                                            hand-in-hand with the college  game. In no conference in the country is                                            this statement more true than the  tradition-rich Southeastern Conference.                                            The ongoing rivalries, the  colorful histories and traditions, the premier                                            tailgating, the coquettish  southern bells in their gameday garb, the reunion                                            of lasting friendships, and the  competitive fire and spirit that accompany                                            the game, all make the entire SEC  football experience a very real, and                                            visceral one--even to the most  casual observer.                                              The Southeastern Conference is  unequivocally the paragon of the college                                            football conferences, and the 2000  season figures not to disappoint the                                            thousands of rabid fans that flock  to the stadiums each week throughout                                            the southeast; as well as the  millions more who tune in from home on the                                            tube to follow their respective  teams. Quite frankly, SEC football has                                            never been bigger, or better. The  southern cultural phenomenon only                                            continues to grow with each  passing season. The number of fans, and the                                            competition that they long for  each and every weekend of the football                                            season, has never been bigger or  better. In 1999, the SEC again set                                            attendance records for its games,  and with the many recent expansions to                                            existing stadiums in the  conference, those records should again fall at the                                            end of this season.                                              Five Reasons Tiger Fans Can Be  Excited About the 2000 Football                                            Season                                             1. Lou Tepper is no longer in  Tiger Town.                                             Heralded by professional defensive  coaches as a ""guru"" and a ""defensive                                            genius"" prior to his arrival at  LSU, the former Illinois head coach led the                                            LSU defense to its worst two-year  performance in the history of the                                            school (1893). If you are  interested in immortalizing the Tepper legacy at                                            LSU for your scrapbook, copies of  his book ""Complete Linebacking""                                            can still be obtained (at a  discounted price no less) at most local book                                            outlets. In Tepper's absence,  maybe the Tigers will return to the days of                                            coach Charlie Mac and the standout  defensive units that were his                                            trademark while at the Ole War  Skule. Speaking of Coach Mac, I caught                                            up with him last week at his home  and he sounded as spry as a spring                                            chicken. He told me that he is  doing great and that he enjoys cycling in                                            the mornings to stay in shape.  Coach told me that he hopes that the LSU                                            players have fun this year,  because, he said, ""...having fun is what it's all                                            about. If you can't have any fun,  you're in big trouble.""                                             2. Contrary to popular belief, the  Tigers are deep at quarterback.                                             Preseason prognosticators have  cited the injury to Rohan Davey as a                                            core reason why the Tigers will  have trouble at the quarterback position.                                            They all opined early that both  Booty and Nall had difficulties leading the                                            offense and that the injury to  Davey was a major setback to the Tiger                                            offense. However, reports from  summer camp indicate that Rohan is now                                            within 95-100 percent of his  normal range of motion on his knee, and in                                            light of this it would appear that  the Tigers are again three-deep at the                                            quarterback position. The  resurgence of Rohan is a tremendous boost to                                            the team. Known for his leadership  ability both on and off the field,                                            Rohan possesses the true grit that  wins ball games. I caught up with                                            former LSU All-American and coach  Gaynell Tinsley at his Highland                                            Road home a few weeks ago, and he  told me that he thought that                                            Rohan's performance against  Arkansas was the best he had ever seen by                                            an LSU quarterback. True frosh  Marcus Randall impressed in the LA                                            High School All-Star game last  week, but he is a likely redshirt with the                                            logjam of experienced competition  ahead of him.                                             3. Nick Saban.                                             Derided unfairly early by most SEC  media outlets as being ""incompatible""                                            with Louisianians' unique culture  and high football expectations, Saban is                                            easily the best thing to happen to  LSU football since Kevin Faulk. A                                            consummate professional, Saban  exudes confidence and paints a clear                                            vision for the future of the  program. His presence in Red Stick has made                                            an immediate impact on the  program, evidenced by the recent glowing                                            comments at media days by seniors  Louis William and Fred Booker.                                            Saban was also unfairly chastised  heavily by the media for his inability to                                            bring any assistants with him to  LSU from his previous staff at Michigan                                            State. However, Coach Saban  recently aptly stated at the SEC media                                            days that only a couple of his  previous staff members had ever been                                            ""south of the Mason-Dixon line.""  That notwithstanding, you cannot argue                                            with the fact that Saban has  compiled a great staff of southern coaches.                                            Tiger fans should find further  solace in the fact that coach Saban has                                            never had a losing record as a  football coach.                                             4. Trev Faulk & Bradie James at  Linebacker.                                             All good defenses have a common  trait--great linebacking play, and you'll                                            be hard-pressed to find two better  young horses than these two. Outside                                            linebacker and pass rushing  specialist Jeremy Lawrence is another super                                            sophomore to keep your eyes on.  These guys all have good wheels, and                                            will put the leather on you when  they get the chance. James' number 11                                            Faulk's recent acquisition of  Mealey's lucky 7 will undoubtedly prompt                                            many fans and commentators to make  countless puns and jokes related                                            to LSU's 7-11 linebacking duo.                                             5. Predictions Don't Mean Diddly                                             The other day I was scouring  through the many rolls of microfilm in the                                            basement of Middleton Library at  LSU, and I stumbled upon this most                                            interesting fact:                                              In August, 1958, LSU was picked to  finish 8th out of 10 SEC teams.                                            Auburn, which had won the national  championship the year prior with                                            Shug Jordan, was picked to repeat  as conference champs, followed by                                            Ole Miss and Mississippi State.                                              Of course, in spite of the dismal  preseason ranking by the SEC                                            sportswriters, the Bengal Tigers  went on to record their only unblemished                                            season and national college  football championship to date. This story                                            should only serve to encourage  fans that are despondent over the                                            outcome of the past two seasons in  Tigertown. Anything can happen in                                            the SEC, and remember, the old  adage says that ""history repeats itself.""                                             Keep the faith Tigerfans!                                             Until next time... ",jay.reitmeyer@enron.com,matthew.lenhart@enron.com,Its getting closer.,2000-07-31 07:16:00-07:00,sent

On the home  page, you will see the?a  place to sign into commissioner.? You must  have an account with  commission.com to join the league.? It is the same  site we used last year  and your name and password should still be active.?  If you don't remember  it, you can create a new one or there is probably  somewhere that you can get  them to email you your?username and  password.? Anyway, once you set up an  account scroll down and select Office  Pool Manager. Our league name is  Losers Wanted.? We also have a short name  of Loser (they might ask for that  also, **notice no 's').? The password is  3333. ? You should be taken to a page to pick who you  are.? Your name should not be  in the list.? Select ""new player"" and  enter your name.? This should take you  to the site. ? Once you are in....BOOKMARK IT.? It will make  it alot easier to get to it in  the future.? Take a look at the site.?  The three main links you will be  using are...1)Make Picks...2)My  Picks...3)Standings.? Each week (I think  Tuesday) commissioner.com will  enter the lines on the Make Picks page.?  These lines will stay constant  untill they close the entries for the week (1  hour before first kick?off,  includes Thursday games).? You can make your  picks and change your picks on  this page.? To view your picks you can go to  My Picks.? On Monday you  can check the Standings.? You can view it by a  certain week or the yearly  totals.? Just click on the top on what column you  will want to sort  by.? That is basically it.?There are other links if you  want to check  them out...it is a great site. ? As for the rules...the money will all be determined  as I get an exact number  of players...ALL MONEY WILL BE PAID OUT!!!!! There will  be weekly winners  and yearly winners (and LOSER).? The picks you make each  week will be each  game that week, including Monday nights game.? In  addition to Monday's game,  you will pick the Monday night total points  scored.? This tie breaker will  determine weekly winners in case of any  ties.? The person closest to the  total will win the tie breaker (absolute  value).? If the absolute value is  equal, the under will beat the  over.? Example...total points is 30.? Player  A picks 35...B picks  20...A wins.? Player A pick 35...B picks 25...B wins.?  Don't worry, it  is real easy.?  ? As for the tie breaker for the season totals.?  Anyone that is tied at the  top will use the playoffs in the NFL as our  playoffs.? I will send out the  lines (the site won't have them) to the  players involved.? You will pick all  four games and the person who gets the  most correct will win.? If multiple  people tie then we will weed out and go  on to the next weeks.? If it makes  it all the way to the superbowl, then we  will pick the game and an  over/under as the ultimate tiebreaker. ? Don't worry if you don't make your picks one  week.? You won't take a zero?(  I am a softie).? Too many people  have those weeks that they can't get around  to making there picks.? If I  gave zeros, that would kill your chances for  the yearly total.? Anyone that  doesn't get their picks in will take all the  AWAY teams.? I will enter  those picks after the deadline to enter picks.?  All these games will count  to the yearly total but can not win the weekly  prize.?  ? That is it for now...Oh ya, one more thing.?  You can send me a check ($50)  to the following.?  ? Michael Brookner 3001 Hillcroft #508 Houston, TX 77057 ? ? PLEASE DON'T FORWARD THIS TO NEW  PLAYERS.??I WANT TO KNOW EVERYONE THAT IS  IN.? IF YOU KNOW  SOMEONE THAT IS INTERESTED, HAVE THEM EMAIL ME AT  BROOK@PDQ.NET.? I WILL SEND ALL THIS INFO  TO THEM WHEN I GET THERE INTEREST. ? ?

One day a recruit named Marcus walked into Jackie Sherrill's Miss. State office and saw his Golden phone sitting there. ""Wow,"" Marcus exclaimed, ""What's that?""  Jackie responded, ""Well son, that's my Golden Phone; it's a direct line to Heaven. ""Wow, that's pretty neat,"" Marcus responded. ""Do you think I could make a call on that phone?""  ""Well yes, but it's going to cost you about $100. You can make the check out to the Mississippi State University Football Foundation,"" replied Jackie. ""That's a lot of money. I don't think I should spend that much. Thanks anyway,"" Marcus replied as he left the office.  A few weeks later Marcus took a visit at the campus of Texas A&M University and went into Coach R. C. Slocum 's office where again he saw a Golden phone.  ""What exactly is that phone for?"" asked Marcus.  Coach Slocum replied, ""That's my direct line to Heaven.""   ""Do you think I could make a call from that phone?"" asked Marcus.  ""Well sure, but it's going to cost you about $200, and you can make the check out to the Texas A&M University Foundation."" replied Slocum.   ""Oh never mind, I don't have that kind of money. Thanks though.""  Marcus shook his head and left Coach Slocum's office.  The next weekend, Marcus took his official visit to Louisiana State University campus and made the office of Coach Saban his first stop. Upon arriving, the first thing Marcus noticed was the Golden phone on Coach Saban's desk.  Marcus asked if that was a direct line to Heaven.  When Coach Saban replied that it was, Marcus again asked if he could make a call using the phone.  ""Well sure you can, but it will cost you 35 cents,"" replied Saban.

"you must be on this ""best conference"" kick b/c your team lost.  sec had a  down year by their standards, but that isn't the point.  lsu beat a good  georgia tech team to win the peach bowl.  texas lost to a pac-10 team.  i  don't need to pump up the lsu's conference b/c we won our bowl game.  i will  pay you, but it is pretty sad that you are cheering for an arch rival that  smoked you guys in dallas.

Big Unit's fastball kills  dove During the seventh inning of the Diamondbacks'  split-squad 10-6 victory  against the Giants on Saturday, Randy Johnson hit  and killed a dove flying  in front of home plate with a fastball. Johnson's  pitch to the Giants'  Calvin Murray was about three-fourths of the way to home  plate when it  struck the bird. Giants second baseman Jeff Kent picked  up the dead bird  with his bare hands and jokingly pointed toward Johnson  before taking it to  the dugout. Johnson was not amused by the incident. ""I  didn't think it was  all that funny,"" he said. On Aug. 4, 1983, Yankees  outfielder Dave Winfield  killed a seagull in Toronto with a warmup throw. The  Ontario police charged  him with animal cruelty, although the charge was later  dropped.

""No, not yet. As the eagle carried the squirrel away in its claws, it flew near the green and the squirrel dropped my ball.""  ""Did you swear THEN?"" asked Mother Superior, becoming impatient. ""No, because the ball fell on a big rock, bounced over the sand trap, rolled onto the green, and stopped about six inches from the hole.""  The two nuns were silent for a moment.

""You see, as the squirrel was running, an eagle came down out of the sky, grabbed the squirrel in his talons and began to fly away!""  ""Is THAT when you swore?"" asks the amazed elder nun.  ""No, not yet. As the eagle carried the squirrel away in its claws, it flew near the green and the squirrel dropped my ball.""  ""Did you swear THEN?"" asked Mother Superior, becoming impatient. ""No, because the ball fell on a big rock, bounced over the sand trap, rolled onto the green, and stopped about six inches from the hole.""  The two nuns were silent for a moment. Then Mother Superior sighed ands said, ""You missed the fucking putt, didn't you?""      ",pulhamus@aol.com,matthew.lenhart@enron.com,[Fwd: Fwd: The golfing nun],2001-04-30 15:00:00-07:00,sent

Travel right. http://expedia.com/ ____________________________________________________________________________ ____  ADVICE TO INTERNATIONAL PASSENGER ON LIMITATION OF LIABILITY Passengers on a journey involving an ultimate destination or a stop in a country other than the country of origin are advised that the provisions of a treaty known as the Warsaw Convention may be applicable to the entire journey, including any portion entirely within the country of origin or destination.  For such passengers on a journey to, from, or with an agreed stopping place in the United States of America, the Convention and special contracts of carriage embodied in applicable tariffs provide that the liability of certain carriers, parties to such special contracts, for death of or personal injury to passengers is limited in most cases to proven damages not to exceed U.S. $75,000 per passenger, and that this liability up to such limit shall not depend on negligence on the part of the carrier. The limit of liability of U.S. $75,000 above is inclusive of legal fees and costs except that in case of a claim brought in a state where provision is made for separate award of legal fees and costs, the limit shall be the sum of U.S. $58,000 exclusive of legal fees and costs.  For such passengers traveling by a carrier not a party to such special contracts or on a journey not to, from, or having an agreed stopping place in the United States of America, liability of the carrier for death or personal injury to passengers is limited in most cases to approximately U.S. $10,000 or U.S. $20,000. The names of carriers, parties to such special contracts, are available at all ticket offices of such carriers and may be examined on request. Additional protection can usually be obtained by purchasing insurance from a private company.  Such insurance is not affected by any limitation of the carrier's liability under the Warsaw Convention or such special contracts of carriage.  For further information please consult your airline or insurance company representative.  NOTICE OF BAGGAGE LIABILITY Liability for loss, delay, or damage to baggage is limited unless a higher value is declared in advance and additional chares are paid.  For most international travel (including domestic portions of international journeys) the liability limit is approximately $9.07 per pound for checked baggage and $400 per passenger for unchecked baggage.  For travel wholly between U.S. points federal rules require any limit on an airline's baggage liability to be at least $1250 per passenger.  Excess valuation may be declared on certain types of articles.  Some carriers assume no liability for fragile, valuable or perishable articles.  Further information may be obtained from the carrier.  CARRIER RESERVES THE RIGHT TO REFUSE CARRIAGE TO ANY PERSON WHO HAS ACQUIRED A TICKET IN VIOLATION OF APPLICABLE LAW OR CARRIER''S TARIFFS, RULES OR REGULATIONS SUBJECT TO TARIFF REGULATIONS  NOTICE OF INCORPORATED TERMS Effective January 1, 1983, this notice forms part of the conditions of contract between the airline and the passenger.  If there is any inconsistency between the incorporated terms described below and the terms and conditions in the passenger's ticket, these incorporated terms govern.  Air transportation to be provided between points in the U.S. (including its overseas territories and possessions) is subject to the individual terms of the transporting air carriers, which are herein incorporated by reference and made part of the contract of carriage. Foreign air transportation is governed by applicable tariffs on file with the U.S. and other governments. Incorporated terms may include, but are not restricted to: 1. Limits on liability for personal injury or death. 2. Limits on liability for baggage, including fragile or perishable goods, and availability of excess valuation coverage. 3. Claims restrictions, including time periods in which passengers must file a claim or bring an action against the air carrier. 4. Rights of the air carrier to change terms of the contract. 5. Rules on reconfirmation of reservations, check-in times, and refusal to carry. 6. Rights of the air carrier and limits on liability for delay or failure to perform service, including schedule changes, substitution of alternate air carriers or aircraft and rerouting. You can obtain additional information on items 1 and 6 above at any U.S. location where the transporting air carrier's tickets are sold.  You have the right to inspect the full text of each transporting air carrier's terms at its airport and city ticket offices.  You also have the right, upon request, to receive free of charge the full text of the applicable terms incorporated by reference from each of the transporting air carriers.  Information on ordering the full text of each air carrier's terms is available at any U.S. location where the air carrier's tickets are sold.  NOTICE-OVERBOOKING OF FLIGHTS  Airline flights may be overbooked, and there is a slight chance that a seat will not be available on a flight for which a person has a confirmed reservation.  If the flight is overbooked, no one will be denied a seat until airline personnel first ask for volunteers willing to give up their reservation in exchange for a payment of the airline's choosing.  If there are not enough volunteers the airline will deny boarding to other persons in accordance with its particular boarding priority.  With few exceptions persons denied boarding involuntarily are entitled to compensation.  The complete rules for the payment of compensation and each airline's boarding priorities are available at all airport ticket counters and boarding locations.  Some airlines do not apply these consumer protections to travel from some foreign countries, although other consumer protections may be available.  Check with the airline or your travel agent.  RECONFIRMATION NOTICE Some international carriers require reconfirmation of your reservations. Contact the transporting air carrier for the applicable requirements.

For such passengers on a journey to, from, or with an agreed stopping place in the United States of America, the Convention and special contracts of carriage embodied in applicable tariffs provide that the liability of certain carriers, parties to such special contracts, for death of or personal injury to passengers is limited in most cases to proven damages not to exceed U.S. $75,000 per passenger, and that this liability up to such limit shall not depend on negligence on the part of the carrier. The limit of liability of U.S. $75,000 above is inclusive of legal fees and costs except that in case of a claim brought in a state where provision is made for separate award of legal fees and costs, the limit shall be the sum of U.S. $58,000 exclusive of legal fees and costs.  For such passengers traveling by a carrier not a party to such special contracts or on a journey not to, from, or having an agreed stopping place in the United States of America, liability of the carrier for death or personal injury to passengers is limited in most cases to approximately U.S. $10,000 or U.S. $20,000. The names of carriers, parties to such special contracts, are available at all ticket offices of such carriers and may be examined on request. Additional protection can usually be obtained by purchasing insurance from a private company.  Such insurance is not affected by any limitation of the carrier's liability under the Warsaw Convention or such special contracts of carriage.  For further information please consult your airline or insurance company representative.  NOTICE OF BAGGAGE LIABILITY Liability for loss, delay, or damage to baggage is limited unless a higher value is declared in advance and additional chares are paid.  For most international travel (including domestic portions of international journeys) the liability limit is approximately $9.07 per pound for checked baggage and $400 per passenger for unchecked baggage.  For travel wholly between U.S. points federal rules require any limit on an airline's baggage liability to be at least $1250 per passenger.  Excess valuation may be declared on certain types of articles.  Some carriers assume no liability for fragile, valuable or perishable articles.  Further information may be obtained from the carrier.  CARRIER RESERVES THE RIGHT TO REFUSE CARRIAGE TO ANY PERSON WHO HAS ACQUIRED A TICKET IN VIOLATION OF APPLICABLE LAW OR CARRIER''S TARIFFS, RULES OR REGULATIONS SUBJECT TO TARIFF REGULATIONS  NOTICE OF INCORPORATED TERMS Effective January 1, 1983, this notice forms part of the conditions of contract between the airline and the passenger.

Leyba)    Weighing in at 352 pounds, Chester McGlockton is the heaviest starting  defensive lineman in Denver Broncos history. He also has become a mighty big  target.       Last month, former San Diego Chargers director of player personnel Billy  Devaney, working for ESPN as an NFL draft analyst, applauded each of the  Broncos' offseason moves - except one. Devaney blasted the Broncos for  signing McGlockton, whom he candidly accused of being a negative locker room  influence.

Donnie -  Sounds good and you missed one hell of a weekend.  From what I hear, everyone had an awesome time.  Celeste and I counted 12 weddings we got invited to this year between the two of us and also sometime this summer, Celeste and I are going to California to visit Alex and Kelly.  I'll let everyone know about the invite, but it may be easier for you to let me know next time you come in town.

I wanted to congratulate you and Celeste.  Again, sorry we were not able to make it down for the wedding.  I think it is safe to assume that the wedding was a bit more fun than the First Communion we went to that Saturday.  I hope there are some good stories.  I am guessing you are back from the honeymoon at this point, and you guys had a great time. Hopefully, you will hold off on populating the earth with any more Florval's.  At least give everyone a few more years to begin preparations. I hope we can somehow try to get together in the near future.  I may try to get down there sometime late summer or fall.  Also, there is always an open invitation at the Casa De Trahan here in DC (actually Northern VA - And to think in my 1st 18 years, all I thought existed was the Westbank.  There is so much more!  Thought you might get a kick out of that comment).  This invitation is good if anyone is passing through or would like to visit our nation's capitol (It's such a better place now that the 'White Trash' that was living in the 'White House' has moved out).  I know it not as cool as Melancon living 5 blocks from Wrigley, but you know?  The invite holds good not only for Mr.& Mrs Louis Florval Generes (what the hell is that?), but also any of the other bums down in Houston that I have not seen if a few years.  Later Val.

I wanted to congratulate you and Celeste.  Again, sorry we were not able to make it down for the wedding.  I think it is safe to assume that the wedding was a bit more fun than the First Communion we went to that Saturday.  I hope there are some good stories.  I am guessing you are back from the honeymoon at this point, and you guys had a great time. Hopefully, you will hold off on populating the earth with any more Florval's.  At least give everyone a few more years to begin preparations. I hope we can somehow try to get together in the near future.  I may try to get down there sometime late summer or fall.  Also, there is always an open invitation at the Casa De Trahan here in DC (actually Northern VA - And to think in my 1st 18 years, all I thought existed was the Westbank.  There is so much more!  Thought you might get a kick out of that comment).  This invitation is good if anyone is passing through or would like to visit our nation's capitol (It's such a better place now that the 'White Trash' that was living in the 'White House' has moved out).  I know it not as cool as Melancon living 5 blocks from Wrigley, but you know?

The firm sales amount of which you did not perform was  5000 mmbtu at $6.90.  Gas daily reported that the weekend traded as low as $3.70.  Therefore, we are assessing liquidated damages in the amount of US$16,000, the amount of which Lisa Feisst will invoice.  I would like to ensure that this problem does not happen again. Wildgoose is not the swing market, and all transactions completed on your screen are firm as are all transactions, unless otherwise specified, with Wildgoose and Alberta Energy Company.  We, at Alberta Energy Company consider this a serious matter, not the dollar figure associated but the implications in the California market place and are treating it as such.  Our companies have had a longstanding relationship and we would like rectify this problem so we can regain trading together in the future.  A letter outlining the above will be sent to yourself  and John Lavorado for your records.

They have finally been released!  For those not familiar with the Darwin Award, it's an annual honor given to the person who provided the universal human gene pool the biggest service by getting killed in the most extraordinarily stupid way.  As always, competition this year has been keen again.  Some candidates appear to have trained their whole lives for this event!  THE RUNNER-UPS  1.  Detroit - A 41-year-old man got stuck and drowned in two feet of water after squeezing head first through an 18-inch wide sewer grate to retrieve his car keys.  2.  San Francisco - A 49-year-old stockbroker, who ""totally zoned when he ran"" according to his wife, jogged off a 100-foot high cliff on his daily run.  3.  Buston, NC - a man died on a beach when an 8-foot-deep hole he had dug into the sand caved in as he sat inside it.  Beachgoers said Daniel Jones, 21, dug the hole for fun or for protection from the wind, and had been sitting in a beach chair at the bottom when it collapsed, burying him beneath 5 feet of sand.   People used their hands and shovels, trying to claw their way to Jones, a resident of Woodbridge, VA, but could not reach him.  It took rescue workers using heavy equipment almost an hour to free him while about 200 people looked on.  Jones was pronounced dead at the hospital.  4.  Lompoc, CA - Santiago Alvarado, 24 was killed as he fell face-first through the ceiling of a bicycle shop he was burglarizing.  Death was caused when the long flashlight he had placed in his mouth rammed into the base of his skull as he hit the floor.  5.  Dahlonega, GA - ROTC cadet Nick Berrena, 20, was stabbed to death by fellow cadet Jeffrey Hoffman, 23, who was trying to prove that a knife could not penetrate the flack vest Berrena was wearing.  6.  Selbyville, DE - Sylvester Briddell, Jr., 26 was killed as he won a bet with friends who said he would not put a revolver loaded with four bullets into his mouth and pull the trigger.  7.  Windsor, Ontario - Daniel Kolta, 27, and Randy Taylor, 33, died in a head-on collision, thus earning a tie in the game of chicken they were playing with their snowmobiles.  8.  Taos, NM - A woman went to a poison control center after eating three birth-control vaginal inserts.  Marie Valishnokov (who spoke little English) thought the inserts were candy or gum, being unable to read the foil wrappers. After the third one, she realized something was wrong with her throat and her mouth began to fill with a sour-tasting foam.  She ran for the Poison Control Center where doctors were able to flush the foam from her mouth, throat and stomach with no ill effects.  9.  La Grange, GA - Attorney Antonio Mendoza was released from a trauma center after having a cell phone removed from his rectum.  ""My dog drags the thing all over the house,"" he said later.  ""He must have dragged it into the shower.  I slipped on the tile, tripped against the dog and sat down right on the thing."" The extraction took more than three hours because the cover to Mendoza's phone had opened during insertion.  ""He was a real trooper during the entire episode,"" said Dr. Dennis Crobe. ""Tony just cracked jokes and really seemed to be enjoying himself.  Three times during the extraction his phone rang and each time, he made jokes about it that just had us rolling on the floor.  By the time we finished, we really did expect to find an answering machine in there.""  10. Bremerton, WA - Christopher Coulter and his wife Emily were engaging in bondage games when Christopher suggested spreading peanut butter on his genitals and letting Rudy, their Irish Setter, lick them clean. Sadly, Rudy lost control and began tearing at Christopher's penis and testicles. Rudy refused to obey commands and a panicked Emily threw a bottle of perfume at the dog.  The bottle broke, covering the dog and Christopher with perfume. Rudy leaped back, tearing away the penis. While trying to get her unconscious husband in the car to take him to the hospital, Emily fell twice, injuring her wrists and ankle. Christopher's penis was put in a Styrofoam ice cooler.  ""Chris is just plain lucky,"" said the surgeon who spent eight hours reattaching the penis.  ""Believe it or not, the perfume turned out to be very fortuitous.  The high alcohol content, which must have been excruciatingly painful, helped sterilize the wound.  Also, aside from it being removed, the damage caused by the dog's teeth to the penis per se is minimal.  It's really a very stringy piece of flesh.  Mr. Coulter stands an excellent chance of regaining the use of that limb."" Washington Animal Control has no plans to seize Rudy.  AND THE WINNER  Paderborn, Germany - Overzealous zookeeper Friedrich Riesfeldt fed his constipated elephant Stefan 22 doses of animal laxative and more than a bushel of berries, figs and prunes before the plugged-up pachyderm finally let fly and suffocated the keeper under 200 pounds of poop. Investigators say ill-fated Friedrich, 46, was attempting to give the ailing elephant an olive-oil enema when the relieved beast unloaded on him like a dumptruck full of mud.  ""The sheer force of the elephant's unexpected defecation knocked Mr. Riesfeldt to the ground, where he struck his head on a rock and lay unconscious as the elephant continued to evacuate his bowels on top of him.

While livin= g in Power dorm, Blanchard once overheard one of the Pi PHi for boys that h= e was hanging out with say ""Hey, Dude, Sorority girls are hot!""  Blanchard,=  being from Paincourteville and not being what we would call a 'master' of = the English language, though that this 'fresh' Pi Phi meant ""All greek girl= s are good in bed.""  So what did Blanchard do.  He went out and found the f= irst GREEK girl he could, and he started dating her.  After many pleasant y= ears, (some of which I will not mention for Tim's sake, and mine)  Tim and = his Greek Goddess are engaged.  Yes, that's right.  Tim took Lenhart's advi= ce (because we all know that Lenhart is the authority on relationships with=  the opposite sex; I mean, who wouldn't take his advice) and Tim decided to=  start his life sentence with a lovely girl who has bunch of friends who al= l give it up like it was going out o! f style. =20 =20 Tim's wedding is on THE DAY OF THE MISSISSIPPI STATE GAME.  For those of yo= u who are not Tiger fans (which seems to be most of you these days), that i= s Oct. 20th.  I know, it is an away game, which is better than having a wed= ding on a home game.  But some of us who are fans like to go to the out of = town games.  True story, here.  I went to a wedding with Louise and her mot= her on Friday night.  You have not lived until you take two dates to a wedd= ing, one of whom is engaged to your good friend and the other whom cannot s= peak the language.  Anyway, after the wedding that we attended, Louise's mo= m asked me if I would prefer Tim's wedding ceremony be in either half Engli= sh and half Greek, or all in Greek.  I responded ""I do not care.  I will be=  listening to the LSU game on my headphones anyway.""  I know what some of y= ou are saying, it is only one game.  Yes, and I am sure that was the only w= eekend they could hav! e it since so many of us from New Orleans have been = to a wedding at the Greek Cultural Center, because all of us from New Orlea= ns have been to numerous weddings / goat roasts there.  Anyway, it is a don= e deal, and we are all happy for the couple. =20 The real point of this e-mail is to organize Tim's bachelor party.  We have=  it planned for the weekend of September 22 (what a novel idea!!!  Plan a w= edding event on a weekend where there is neither an LSU event, nor Jazz Fes= t!!!)  We are planning to go to Vegas.  As per our current plans, we would = leave on that Thursday (the 20th, I think) and return on Sunday.  'Paw Paw'=  Blanchard heard that in September, his game of choice really starts hittin= g, that of course would be the nickel slots.  'Paw Paw' already has his Pan= ama Jack hat, his         ""Geaux Dinar-deaux"" T-shirt, his jams, and his bl= ack socks with brown leather sandals packed and ready.  His fanny pack is s= tuffed with Twinkies and silver dimes.  He is really fired up about the $1.= 99 shrimp cocktail (early bird special, of course.) The plans are to get there Thursday night (Nicky, get more drink tickets.) =  Thursday night we can get settled, possibly gamble a bit.  On Friday, mayb= e play golf (although I will probably be too drunk / hung over / missing fo= r an early tee time.)  On Friday night, we can go ""clubbin'"", as I am sure = The Tricky Texas Trio (Lenhart, Landry, and Mitch) will want to do.  On Sat= urday, Tim wants to wake up early, get the sports section of the Advocate, = drink coffee, and bitch about the Tigers.  Instead, we are going to watch a= nd bet on College Football all day. Saturday night, Tim wants to go see Sigfried and Roy.  However, we are not = doing that.  If he wants to see gay men play with caged tigers, he can find=  out the next time Nesbitt tries out for the LSU cheerleading team.  Instea= d, either SaturDay or Friday night, myself and a select group (yet to be de= termined, but including Lenhart if he is not doing his best Ricky Martin im= pression at Club C2K) will go on a recon mission to the Deja Vu.  Therefore= , on Saturday night, we will have entertainment in the room that some of us=  have seen before, and who know what is expected of them (that way Lenhart = will not make the entertainment  cry when he asks them to fuck his Elway bl= ow-up doll).  Remember Tim.  If you use a strap on, it is not considered ch= eating.  I am a future lawyer.  I should know. This weekend is September 22.  There is no excuse for you to come up with w= hen you have this much notice.  Out of money?  Bullshit.  Save up until the= n.  Have to work?  Bullshit.  Take a vacation day.  Actually, September wil= l be the first month that I will be gainfully employed.  But, I know that m= y boss, the Honorable G.Thomas Porteous, will let me off for one day if deb= auchery will be had, although I may have to put a few hundreds on black for=  him periodically throughout the weekend. For those of you who will be recently married, I already have an excuse for=  you.  ""Honey, Tim came to all OUR wedding functions.  The least I can do i= s return the favor."" For those of you that will be married shortly after Tim, I also have an exc= use. ""Baby / Schmoopy / I wish your tits were as big as Mindy/, if want oth= er people to come to our wedding functions, then I have to attend theirs."" =  For all of you single guys, no excuse. Please respond to this e-mail at your earliest convenience, or I will see y= a'll this weekend.  All plans are subject to change.

For such passengers on a journey to, from, or with an agreed stopping place in the United States of America, the Convention and special contracts of carriage embodied in applicable tariffs provide that the liability of certain carriers, parties to such special contracts, for death of or personal injury to passengers is limited in most cases to proven damages not to exceed U.S. $75,000 per passenger, and that this liability up to such limit shall not depend on negligence on the part of the carrier. The limit of liability of U.S. $75,000 above is inclusive of legal fees and costs except that in case of a claim brought in a state where provision is made for separate award of legal fees and costs, the limit shall be the sum of U.S. $58,000 exclusive of legal fees and costs.  For such passengers traveling by a carrier not a party to such special contracts or on a journey not to, from, or having an agreed stopping place in the United States of America, liability of the carrier for death or personal injury to passengers is limited in most cases to approximately U.S. $10,000 or U.S. $20,000. The names of carriers, parties to such special contracts, are available at all ticket offices of such carriers and may be examined on request. Additional protection can usually be obtained by purchasing insurance from a private company.  Such insurance is not affected by any limitation of the carrier's liability under the Warsaw Convention or such special contracts of carriage.  For further information please consult your airline or insurance company representative.  NOTICE OF BAGGAGE LIABILITY Liability for loss, delay, or damage to baggage is limited unless a higher value is declared in advance and additional chares are paid.  For most international travel (including domestic portions of international journeys) the liability limit is approximately $9.07 per pound for checked baggage and $400 per passenger for unchecked baggage.  For travel wholly between U.S. points federal rules require any limit on an airline's baggage liability to be at least $1250 per passenger.  Excess valuation may be declared on certain types of articles.  Some carriers assume no liability for fragile, valuable or perishable articles.  Further information may be obtained from the carrier.  CARRIER RESERVES THE RIGHT TO REFUSE CARRIAGE TO ANY PERSON WHO HAS ACQUIRED A TICKET IN VIOLATION OF APPLICABLE LAW OR CARRIER''S TARIFFS, RULES OR REGULATIONS SUBJECT TO TARIFF REGULATIONS  NOTICE OF INCORPORATED TERMS Effective January 1, 1983, this notice forms part of the conditions of contract between the airline and the passenger.  If there is any inconsistency between the incorporated terms described below and the terms and conditions in the passenger's ticket, these incorporated terms govern.  Air transportation to be provided between points in the U.S. (including its overseas territories and possessions) is subject to the individual terms of the transporting air carriers, which are herein incorporated by reference and made part of the contract of carriage. Foreign air transportation is governed by applicable tariffs on file with the U.S. and other governments. Incorporated terms may include, but are not restricted to: 1. Limits on liability for personal injury or death. 2. Limits on liability for baggage, including fragile or perishable goods, and availability of excess valuation coverage. 3. Claims restrictions, including time periods in which passengers must file a claim or bring an action against the air carrier. 4. Rights of the air carrier to change terms of the contract. 5. Rules on reconfirmation of reservations, check-in times, and refusal to carry. 6. Rights of the air carrier and limits on liability for delay or failure to perform service, including schedule changes, substitution of alternate air carriers or aircraft and rerouting. You can obtain additional information on items 1 and 6 above at any U.S. location where the transporting air carrier's tickets are sold.  You have the right to inspect the full text of each transporting air carrier's terms at its airport and city ticket offices.  You also have the right, upon request, to receive free of charge the full text of the applicable terms incorporated by reference from each of the transporting air carriers.  Information on ordering the full text of each air carrier's terms is available at any U.S. location where the air carrier's tickets are sold.  NOTICE-OVERBOOKING OF FLIGHTS  Airline flights may be overbooked, and there is a slight chance that a seat will not be available on a flight for which a person has a confirmed reservation.  If the flight is overbooked, no one will be denied a seat until airline personnel first ask for volunteers willing to give up their reservation in exchange for a payment of the airline's choosing.  If there are not enough volunteers the airline will deny boarding to other persons in accordance with its particular boarding priority.  With few exceptions persons denied boarding involuntarily are entitled to compensation.  The complete rules for the payment of compensation and each airline's boarding priorities are available at all airport ticket counters and boarding locations.  Some airlines do not apply these consumer protections to travel from some foreign countries, although other consumer protections may be available.  Check with the airline or your travel agent.  RECONFIRMATION NOTICE Some international carriers require reconfirmation of your reservations. Contact the transporting air carrier for the applicable requirements.

Allen King has said there is no way he would have paid $12.35 at MALIN on that day.

The second audio file below relates to SITARA #573532 where Allen says the 5,000 is at $8.85. We show the whole day (1/19/01) at $8.90.....see rows 158 & 159 of my attached spreadsheet.

The $12.35 vs $10.50 issue relates to SITARA #576162 (first audio file below). Allen King has said there is no way he would have paid $12.35 at MALIN on that day. Please see rows 182 & 183 on my attached spreadsheet....is it possible that  SITARA #576162 was copied from SITARA#575575, but the price is different?   The second audio file below relates to SITARA #573532 where Allen says the 5,000 is at $8.85. We show the whole day (1/19/01) at $8.90.....see rows 158 & 159 of my attached spreadsheet.

"June 8, 2001  Dear MATTHEW LENHART:  We are delighted that you have made a smart energy choice by signing up with NewPower(tm) as part of the Texas Electric Choice Pilot Program. Tens of thousands of Texas households have joined you in taking advantage of the tremendous savings NewPower will provide you over the next two years.  As your new energy supplier, we wanted to make sure that you were informed of a recent development affecting you as a participant of the pilot program. NewPower was recently notified by the Texas Public Utility Commission (PUC) that the pilot program will be phased in more slowly over the summer months. A more gradual timetable for processing switches from your local utility to energy service providers, such as NewPower, will help to ensure a seamless transition between energy suppliers for the thousands of Texans who have enrolled in the program.  Click below to read the official announcement from the Texas PUC. This requires you to have Adobe Acrobat Reader: http://i2.innovyx.com/newpower/pilot_ltr.pdf  If you do not have Adobe Acrobat Reader, please click below and follow instructions for free download: http://tr.innovyx.com/redir.asp?148_48_6425  What does this mean for you? It simply means that your NewPower service will begin during July instead of June as originally planned. Until then, your existing provider will continue to provide your electricity, uninterrupted. Rest assured, once your NewPower service begins, you'll still get the same great rates and excellent customer service you were promised when you signed up. Better yet, to thank you for your patience, we're sending your enrollment incentive early! Instead of processing it upon receipt of your first bill payment, we're processing it immediately. You should receive it within the next few weeks.  There is no need for you to take any action.  NewPower expects that the Texas Public Utility Commission will enable us to begin providing your household with electric service after July 6th. In the meantime, NewPower will send a welcome letter notifying you of the effective date of your NewPower service.  If you have any questions or concerns, please visit the Public Utility Commission's website at http://tr.innovyx.com/redir.asp?148_49_6425 or call NewPower at 1-877-819-9817. (For help in Spanish, call 1-866-523-4176.)  Best regards, and welcome to NewPower!  Nick Utton Chief Marketing Officer  ><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><>< If you do not wish to receive important announcements regarding your energy service via email, simply reply to this mail with the word ""unsubscribe"" in the subject line.

Heard you put on a kickass party...I heard ALL the details..:)  Anyway,  as it is now close to January, Max wants me to send an email to you to pass on to all the ushers (Peder, Ryan, Scott &  Merlin) since you have their email addresses. Florida in January is pretty busy, so you definately want to book your hotel reservations NOW...you don't need a deposit yet, I don't think, you just need to hold a room.  Here is the info. on the hotel where everyone is staying (where we got group rates), also this is where the Rehearsal Dinner & the Sunday brunch are...the wedding is down the street, so you guys may just want one rental car for all of you.  I think Thursday afternoon  is when you will all go to the Tux place in North Miami to try on your tuxes & make sure that the measurments are right when they still have enough time to make any adjustments.  Friday, during the day, Max will have something planned for you guys...  Please start getting your measurements now & we will send you another email when we find the place for you to call in your measurements in Miami.  Call with any questions (303) 832-8160....The hotties in Miami are waiting for you...

Hey there....thanks for your concern for my friends & family after the tragedy...everyone is okay, thank G-d...how about your friends?  I have one sister in DC & one in NYC, so it was a pretty traumatic week, but everyone is okay & that is what's important.  Alli (my sis in NYC) happened to be at a meeting on Wall Street that morning, so she was 2 blocks away & was covered in debris running from the building, so she will probably need therapy like the rest of Manhattan!  On a happier note...thanks for forwarding that email to the ushers...did you get the $160 rate with our block of rooms when you reserved your room? As far as the tux goes..when we go to Miami in October to finalize everything, Max will send the guys the form for the tuxes to return your measurements to the place in Miami & you guys will go get fitted & pick them up on Thurs. afternoon or Fri. morning before the wedding....I dont know what Max has planned for you guys on Friday...who are you sharing a room with?  :)  Stacey is probably going stag....just kidding....  We went to a wedding this weekend & watched the best man make a speech & Max & I just cracked up because all we could do was picture your speech!  I have faith that you'll deliver a beautiful speech, right????  Hope all is well there...when are you moving here to collect your ""wingman""?

Date: Fri, 5 Oct 2001 14:17:26 -0500 GET THIS ARTICLE INTO THE HANDS OF EVERY LSU FAN YOU KNOW! SPORTS COMMENTARY LSU's famed `Death Valley' is a fraud Mike Bianchi October 5, 2001 It happened yet again earlier this week. The talking heads on one of the sports networks came on and started previewing Florida's game at LSU on Saturday and, sure enough, the first words out of Pavlov's mouth were these: ""Tiger Stadium might just be the toughest place in the nation to play."" Give that man a liver snack. This is my No. 1 pet peeve in all of sports: the perpetual misinformation and baseless genuflecting at the mere mention of LSU's ""Death Valley."" The three biggest myths in popular world culture are, in reverse order: 3. The Loch ness Monster. 2. The Skunk Ape. 1. LSU's home-field advantage. Why is it that magazine after magazine and commentator after commentator insist on perpetuating the biggest fish story in college football? Sport magazine named Tiger Stadium ""the most feared road-playing site in America."" Gannett News Service named Tiger Stadium the ""most dreaded"" road site in America. Just last week, ESPN.com did a poll asking respondents to name the five college football venues they would most like to visit. The choices: Michigan, Notre Dame, Tennessee, Nebraska and LSU. Are you kidding me? Putting Tiger Stadium on a list with other such legendary football destinations is like conducting a poll of the great vacation destinations and offering up these choices: Hawaii, Orlando, Tahiti, Las Vegas and Scranton. Do the people who conduct these polls actually -- I don't know -- pay attention! You want to know how intimidating Tiger Stadium is? * LSU's home record against Alabama the past 16 years is 1-15-1. * LSU's home record against SEC teams the past 10 years is 18-21. * LSU's home record against Florida's past two football coaches (Galen Hall and Steve Spurrier) is 1-6. It's so easy to win at LSU that Hall beat the Tigers 16-13 in 1989, and UF officials were so impressed they fired him the next day. Actually, LSU barely plays better at home than it does away. That 18-21 SEC home record over the past decade is only barely better than its 15-23-1 road mark. Has any venue been more of a one-hit wonder than Tiger Stadium, which has been living off Billy Cannon's famous 1959 punt return for nearly a half-century now? Bo Donaldson and the Heywoods had Billy Don't Be a Hero; LSU had Billy Do Be a Hero. Not just anybody goes into Tiger Stadium and wins; everybody and his brother does. UAB did last year. Houston did in 1999. In the past three years, Ole Miss, Alabama, Auburn, Florida and Georgia have. Are we leaving anybody out? Oh, yeah, I almost forgot: Kentucky has, too. ESPN college football analyst Lee Corso says it's not Tiger Stadium that's so tough; it's Tiger Stadium at night that's so tough. ""If you check it out over the last few years, I'll bet you they win eight out of 10 home games at night,"" he said. Not so fast, my friend. ""Well, then, how about seven out of 10?"" Corso said. Wrong again. In the 1990s, LSU was 35-21 at home at night; that's barely six out of 10. And a lot of those victories came against moonpies such as Arkansas State, Western Carolina and Pinky's Cosmetology Institute. Its name is Tiger Stadium; they should call it Pussycat Pavilion. Opponents call it Death Valley; they should call Life Blood. It's time to stop spreading the biggest lie in all of sports. That Tiger Stadium mystique everybody talks about is really nothing more than a Tiger Stadium mirage. Mike Bianchi can be reached at mbianchi@orlandosentinel.com.

Date: Fri, 5 Oct 2001 14:17:26 -0500 GET THIS ARTICLE INTO THE HANDS OF EVERY LSU FAN YOU KNOW! SPORTS COMMENTARY LSU's famed `Death Valley' is a fraud Mike Bianchi October 5, 2001 It happened yet again earlier this week. The talking heads on one of the sports networks came on and started previewing Florida's game at LSU on Saturday and, sure enough, the first words out of Pavlov's mouth were these: ""Tiger Stadium might just be the toughest place in the nation to play."" Give that man a liver snack. This is my No. 1 pet peeve in all of sports: the perpetual misinformation and baseless genuflecting at the mere mention of LSU's ""Death Valley."" The three biggest myths in popular world culture are, in reverse order: 3. The Loch ness Monster. 2. The Skunk Ape. 1. LSU's home-field advantage. Why is it that magazine after magazine and commentator after commentator insist on perpetuating the biggest fish story in college football? Sport magazine named Tiger Stadium ""the most feared road-playing site in America."" Gannett News Service named Tiger Stadium the ""most dreaded"" road site in America. Just last week, ESPN.com did a poll asking respondents to name the five college football venues they would most like to visit. The choices: Michigan, Notre Dame, Tennessee, Nebraska and LSU. Are you kidding me? Putting Tiger Stadium on a list with other such legendary football destinations is like conducting a poll of the great vacation destinations and offering up these choices: Hawaii, Orlando, Tahiti, Las Vegas and Scranton. Do the people who conduct these polls actually -- I don't know -- pay attention! You want to know how intimidating Tiger Stadium is? * LSU's home record against Alabama the past 16 years is 1-15-1. * LSU's home record against SEC teams the past 10 years is 18-21. * LSU's home record against Florida's past two football coaches (Galen Hall and Steve Spurrier) is 1-6.

Have you ever been to Tiger Stadium on a Saturday night?  Have you ever heard the Tiger Band from Tigerland play as the Tigers take the field?  Were you not there in 1997 when we beat the shit out of the then ranked #1 Florida Gators?  If you didn't write about sports, would you still feel like a man? I bet the answer to all of these questions is a resounding NO.  You never hear any other columnists or coaches banging on other venues within their conferences because of the respect and pride they have of their own conference.  You don't deserve the SEC and you don't deserve to write about it.  I hope you are at the game Saturday night.  Win or lose, a few things will definitely happen.  1)Before the game, you will get a rush hearing the Tiger band make their way to the stadium.  2)You will get a rush when the Tigers run out on the field.  3)You will hold your ears like a pussy when you hear a crowd like you've never heard before.  4)And lastly, you will wish you went to LSU.  _________________________________________________________________ Get your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer.msn.com/intl.asp",valgeneres@hotmail.com,matthew.lenhart@enron.com,RE: Death Valley,2001-10-08 06:14:33-07:00,sent

Fred Smoot (leg), however, is in danger of missin= g this weekend's contest against Carolina. Darrell Green would replace Smoo= t if he's unable to go.   Rob Moore , WR ARI - Martin Updated 10/17/01 Moor= e (hamstring) is listed as probable for Sunday's game against Kansas City. = He hasn't been full speed at practice, h! ow! ever, so don't consider him F= antasy-wise just yet.   Patrick Jeffers , WR CAR - Free Agent Updated 10/17= /01 Jeffers (knees) saw extensive work in practice today and may be ready t= o play this weekend against New Orleans. However, Jeffers is too risky to s= tart from a Fantasy perspective.   Muhsin Muhammad , WR CAR - Martin Update= d 10/17/01 Muhammad's ribs are still sore after taking a few shots during S= unday's game against New Orleans. Coach George Seifert expects him to play,=  but he may be somewhat limited. Unless his status improves by the end of t= he week, Fantasy owners may want to consider benching Muhammad! i! f at all=  possible.   Chris Weinke , QB CAR - Tori Updated 10/17/01 Weinke missed pr= actice on Wednesday due to a thigh injury. However, Head Coach George Seife= rt expects the rookie quarterback to start on Sunday against Washington. If=  you need a quarterback this week, Weinke is a good choice facing a terribl= e Redskins' defense.   Terance Mathis , WR ATL - Frank Updated 10/17/01 Mat= his (hand) returned to practice on Wednesday. He is expected to start on Su= nday against New Orleans, but he's only worth starting in deeper leagues fr= om a Fantasy perspective.    Shawn Jefferson , WR ATL - Free Agent Updated = 10/17/01 Jefferson (toe) returned to practice on Wednesday. He is expected = to be in the starting lineup on Sunday against New Orleans, but he's too un= reliable to use Fantasy-wise.   Ryan Leaf , QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/= 17/01 Leaf worked with he first team offense during practice on Wednesday. = He was filling in for Anthony Wright, who was given the day off to rest his=  swollen right knee. Leaf will have his chance to win the starting job in D= allas, but he has no real Fantasy value at this time.   Troy Hambrick , RB = DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01 Now that Robert Thomas is gone for the ye= ar, Hambrick is expected to become Dallas' starting fullback. He's shown fl= ashes of brilliance at times, but his value as a Fantasy player is still mi= nimal at this point.   Michael Bennett , RB MIN - Matty Updated 10/17/01 Be= nnett is listed as doubtful for Sunday's game against Green Bay due to a ri= ght ankle injury. Expect Doug Chapman to get the start, with Travis Prentic= e serving as his backup. Don't use Bennett this week.  Randy Moss , WR MIN = - Russell Updated 10/17/01 Moss is listed as questionable for Sunday's game=  against Green Bay with a right ankle injury. While we normally tell you to=  start him every week, this is one matchup we wouldn't activate him for unl= ess it becomes completely clear he will start.  Shane Matthews , QB CHI - F= ree Agent Updated 10/17/01 The Bears re-signed Matthews on Tuesday. He retu= rns to his old backup QB job and isn't worth adding to your Fantasy roster.=   Terrell Davis , RB DEN - JWillie Updated 10/17/01 According to published = reports, Davis would like to return to the li! ne! up Sunday at San Diego. = He has recovered from a knee injury, and Broncos Head Coach Mike Shanahan w= ants him to return by November 4. We don't recommend you use Davis this wee= k, although this development also makes it tough to recommend you start any=  Broncos running back.   Stacey Mack , RB JAC - Hunter Updated 10/17/01 Mac= k will get a lot of carries this week but don't expect him to be too produc= tive. He only gained 17 yards on nine carries in the Jaguars' previous.   K= eenan McCardell , WR JAC - Neal/McKay Updated 10/17/01 McCardell struggled = in his first few games back from injury, but looked like his old self in th= e previous game. Look for McCardell to play well this week and catch a lot = of passes.    Sean Dawkins , WR JAC - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01 Dawkins w= ill have a tough time against Buffalo this week. He will catch of couple of=  passes but won't find his way into the end zone.   Mark Brunell , QB JAC -=  JWillie Updated 10/17/01 Brunell is no longer being bothered by headaches = and is expected to play in Week Six. Look for him to throw for over 200 yar= ds and a score.     Kyle Brady , TE JAC - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01 Brady=  is expected to play in this week's game despite a hip injury, and is liste= d as probable.! H! e won't be too productive if he does play. Brady only ha= s five catches this season.   Jimmy Smith , WR JAC - Frank Updated 10/17/01=  Smith has been very consistent this season. Look for him to catch several = passes and score a touchdown against Buffalo.  Herman Moore , WR DET - Free=  Agent Updated 10/17/01 Moore will miss the remainder of the season after t= earing a muscle in his hip during Sunday's game at Minnesota. ""We're disapp= ointed the injury is much worse than we thought,"" Lions Head Coach Marty Mo= rnhinweg said. ""We believed it was a minor pull, but the MRI showed a signi= ficant tear in the muscle."" Drop Moore if he was on your Fantasy tea! m.! L= arry Foster assumes the No. 3 receiver job in Detroit.  Tyrone Wheatley , R= B OAK - Giggles Updated 10/17/01 According to published reports, Wheatley w= ill miss three to four weeks with a right knee sprain. The veteran back was=  beginning to lose carries to Charlie Garner before he was hurt.  Charlie G= arner , RB OAK - Russell Updated 10/17/01 The Contra-Costa Times points out=  Garner has apparently supplanted Tyrone Wheatley as the team's ""workhorse""=  back. The trend was apparent before Wheatley was reported to miss three to=  four weeks with a knee injury.  Travis Henry , RB BUF - Martin Updated 10/= 17/01 Henry told the Buffalo News he plans to have minor surgery on both kn= ees after the season. Henry has tendinitis in both knees, but it will not a= ffect him during the regular season.  Jay Riemersma , TE BUF - Free Agent U= pdated 10/17/01 The Buffalo News says the Bills want to get Riemersma more = involved in the offense now that tackles Jonas Jennings and John Fina are h= ealthy again. Riemersma was being asked to block more often early in the ye= ar, but he will now become more involved in the passing game.  Jerome Patho= n , WR IND - Tori Updated 10/17/01 It is not clear if Pathon (foot) will be=  able to play this week against the Patriots. Pathon missed Sunday's game a= gainst Oakland. Reggie Wayne would start in Pathon's place if he cannot pla= y again.  Dedric Ward , WR MIA - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01 The Miami Hera= ld says Ward had his foor placed in a boot because he had a problem with st= ress protection. The Dolphins do not know when he will return.  Emmitt Smit= h , RB DAL - Bass/Hull Updated 10/17/01 According to the Dallas Morning Sta= ! , Smith could end up splitting more carries with Troy Hambrick in the com= ing weeks. Head Coach Dave Campo believes the two backs complement each oth= er very well, and that the move will keep Smith fresh for a longer duration=  on game day.   Stephen Alexander , TE WAS - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01 Al= exander underwent an MRI on his injured right ankle Monday, which revealed = a high sprain. He is expected to miss at least two weeks of action due to t= he injury, so be sure to reserve him if he is still on your roster.   Micha= el Pittman , RB ARI - Matty Updated 10/17/01 Pittman, who suffered a concus= sion during Sunday's loss to Chicago, is expected to practice on Tuesday. H= is status for this weekend's game against Kansas City is questionable, but = he is expected to play.  Greg Clark , TE SF - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01 C= lark went through his most extensive workout since undergoing surgery on hi= s right hamstring three weeks ago. ""It was encouraging,"" Clark told the Con= tra Costa Times. ""I ran (a half mile). I never could do any of that before = the last surgery (which removed his semitendonosis tendon). The most I coul= d do was jog two minutes. It's an amazing difference in comparison."" Head C= oach Steve Mariucci doesn't know when Clark will be healthy enough to make = his season debut, however, but he did rule Clark out for their Oct. 28 game=  against Chicago.    More Updates  Playe! r ! News Teams  [IMAGE]  Matty Pl= ayer News  Michael Pittman , Active RB Updated 10/17/01 Pittman, who suffer= ed a concussion during Sunday's loss to Chicago, is expected to practice on=  Tuesday. His status for this weekend's game against Kansas City is questio= nable, but he is expected to play.   Giants , Active DT Updated 10/17/01 De= fensive tackle Keith Hamilton suffered a separated shoulder during Sunday's=  game against St. Louis, but he is expected to play on Monday night against=  Philadelphia. Linebacker Mike Barrow has a hip pointer, but should be able=  to play in the game as well with some extra padding. CB Will Allen has a s= prained ankle, and his status against the Eagles is questionable at this po= int.   Michael Bennett , Reserve RB Updated 10/17/01 Bennett is listed as d= oubtful for Sunday's game against Green Bay due to a right ankle injury. Ex= pect Doug Chapman to get the start, with Travis Prentice serving as his bac= kup. Don't use Bennett this week.  Marshall Faulk , Active RB Updated 10/16= /01 Faulk has not been ruled out of Sunday's game against the New York Jets=  despite a bruised right knee. ""He really could possibly play this week,"" c= oach Mike Martz said. ""We're not going to rule the possibility of him playi= ng completely out."" If Faulk is unable to go, however, Trung Canidate will = be the featured back in the game. At this point, it's tough to make a decis= ion on whether or not to start Faulk Fantasy-wise, so monitor the situation=  throughout the week.   Brian Griese , Reserve QB Updated 10/16/01 The Bron= cos are unsure whether Griese will be ready for Sunday's game in San Diego,=  according to the Denver Post. However, An MRI Monday morning on his right = shoulder revealed no structural damage and no tie to his previous shoulder = surgeries. Griese is questionable for Wednesday's practice as well as Sunda= y's game, and if he's out, expect Gus Frerotte to get the start.  Brad John= son , Reserve QB Updated 10/14/01 Johnson finally had a productive game Fan= tasy-wise, throwing for 287 yards and three scores against Tennessee. He is=  still not worth starting on a regular basis, however, and is better off us= ed when the matchup is good.   Terry Glenn , Active WR Updated 10/14/01 Gle= nn had a huge game in his return from a suspension, catching seven passes f= or 110 yards and a score. He won't post numbers that good on a weekly basis= , but he is worth picking up and starting if you need help with your receiv= ers.   Rod Smith , Active WR Updated 10/12/01 Smith's yardage numbers might=  be a bit disappointing this week if Seattle CB Shawn Springs (hamstring, p= robable) is close to top form. But he should still catch at least one TD pa= ss as the Seahawks hurt their secondary with the lack of a solid pass rush.=   Frank Wycheck , Reserve TE Updated 10/12/01 Look for Wycheck to catch a l= ot of passes this week. He hasn't had a lot of looks because he has been us= ed mostly as a fullback, blocking for Eddie George. But George is suffering=  from an ankle injury and isn't expected to get a lot of carries. The Titan= s will throw to Wycheck to compensate.   Joe Horn , Active WR Updated 10/12= /01 Horn is a must-start this weekend against Carolina. The Panthers' secon= dary is very vulnerable, and Horn has put up good numbers against them in t= he past.   Oronde Gadsden , Reserve WR Updated 10/12/01 Gadsden should find=  himself in position to catch a TD pass against the Jets. Miami will score = often against the New York defense.  Sebastian Janikowski , Active K Update= d 10/10/01 Janikowki needed five stitches to close a cut on his head that w= as suffered during an off-field incident. He has not missed practice and sh= ould play against the Colts this week.  J.J. Stokes , Reserve WR Updated 10= /09/01 Stokes, who injured his knee during Sunday's win over Carolina, is l= isted as probable for this weekend's contest at Atlanta. He's been inconsis= tent thus far, and shouldn't be depended on to produce Fantasy-wise.   Aaro= n Brooks , Active QB Updated 10/08/01 Brooks turned in his second consecuti= ve mediocre performance Sunday. He only threw for 210 yards with an interce= ption and no touchdown passes. Brooks has struggled in the last two games b= ut the Saints will stick with him as the starter since they are winning gam= es. He's worth a starting spot Fantasy-wise this week against Carolina.

Garcia is dealing with a=  sore throwing elbow, as well as a few other nagging bumps and bruises. How= ever, he's still expected to start in the 49ers' next game on Oct. 28 again= st Chicago.   Peerless Price , WR BUF - Matt Lenhart Updated 10/18/01 Price=  might post respectable numbers against ! th! e Jaguars. Jacksonville's sec= ondary is thin because of injuries.  Eric Moulds , WR BUF - Matt Lenhart Up= dated 10/18/01 Moulds might get in the end zone against Jacksonville. Look = for the Bills to move him around often against the injury-riddled Jaguars s= econdary.  Larry Centers , RB BUF - Free Agent Updated 10/18/01 Centers has=  been Buffalo's most reliable receiver so far, but that trend might change = against Jacksonville. Buffalo might look to attack an injury-riddled Jaguar= s secondary with passes to WR Peerless Price and TE Jay Riemersma.  Drew Bl= edsoe , QB NE - FIBSABs Updated 10/18/01 There's a very slim chance Bledsoe=  will be in uniform as the emergency quarterback this week .     Bledsoe wa= s upgraded from ""out"" to ""doubtful"" on the injury report, but he's lost 15 = pounds and hasn't been cleared to run, throw or be hit. He has pedaled a st= ationary bicycle and probably would just hand off the ball if Brady and No.=  2 quarterback Damon Huard are sidelined.   Bledsoe's progress has been slo= wer than he hoped and there's no timetable for his return.     Tyrone Wheat= ley , RB OAK - Tori Kuykendall Updated 10/18/01 Wheatley won't practice dur= ing the team's week off and could possibly miss the next game because of an=  injured right knee.          ""Tyrone Wheatley has a second degre! e ! - I = don't know if it's a sprain or a tear - of his MCL,""' coach Jon Gruden said=  Wednesday.   Gruden called Wheatley questionable for the Oct. 28 game at P= hiladelphia. He said he would learn more about the injury as the week progr= essed.   He disputed reports that Wheatley would be out four weeks.   ""I wo= uld not agree with that at this time,"" Gruden said.     Chris Weinke , QB C= AR - Free Agent Updated 10/18/01 Weinke sat out practice Wednesday and it's=  uncertain whether he will play in Washington on Sunday because of a thigh = injury. The injury is more serious than the Panthers first expected. Seifer= t said Monday that Weinke had a deep thigh bruise, but expected him to prac= tice Wednesday. Seifert said he didn't know if Weinke would practice Thursd= ay. Dameyune Craig would start if Weinke cannot play.  Brian Griese , QB DE= N - Fear Updated 10/18/01 Griese said Wednesday his sore shoulder has impro= ved and! h! e's confident he'll play Sunday against San Diego.   Griese com= plained of shoulder soreness after a hit against the Kansas City Chiefs on = Oct. 7. The problem was aggravated Sunday when he was slammed to the turf b= y Seattle Seahawks defensive end Lamar King.   Tests Monday showed no struc= tural damage to his shoulder.     Redskins , DT WAS - Rocks Updated 10/17/0= 1 Cornerback Champ Bailey missed practice on Wednesday due to a sprained an= kle, but he's expected to play on Sunday. Fred Smoot (leg), however, is in = danger of missing this weekend's contest against Carolina. Darrell Green wo= uld replace Smoot if he's unable to go.   Rob Moore , WR ARI - Free Agent U= pdated 10/17/01 Moore (hamstring) is listed as probable for Sunday's game a= gainst Kansas City. He hasn't been full speed at practice, however, so don'= t be surprised if his status is downgraded over the next two day! s.!   Pat= rick Jeffers , WR CAR - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01 Jeffers (knees) saw ext= ensive work in practice today and may be ready to play this weekend against=  New Orleans. However, Jeffers is too risky to start from a Fantasy perspec= tive.   Muhsin Muhammad , WR CAR - Fear Updated 10/17/01 Muhammad's ribs ar= e still sore after taking a few shots during Sunday's game against New Orle= ans. Coach George Seifert expects him to play, but he may be somewhat limit= ed. Unless his status improves by the end of the week, Fantasy owners may w= ant to consider benching Muhammad if at a! ll! possible.   Chris Weinke , Q= B CAR - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01 Weinke missed practice on Wednesday due=  to a thigh injury. However, Head Coach George Seifert expects the rookie q= uarterback to start on Sunday against Washington. If you need a quarterback=  this week, Weinke is a good choice facing a terrible Redskins' defense.   = Terance Mathis , WR ATL - McKay Neal Updated 10/17/01 Mathis (hand) returne= d to practice on Wednesday. He is expected to start on Sunday against New O= rleans, but he's only worth starting in deeper leagues from a Fantasy persp= ective.  ! Shawn Jefferson , WR ATL - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01 Jefferson=  (toe) returned to practice on Wednesday. He is expected to be in the start= ing lineup on Sunday against New Orleans, but he's too unreliable to use Fa= ntasy-wise.   Ryan Leaf , QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01 Leaf worked = with he first team offense during practice on Wednesday. He was filling in = for Anthony Wright, who was given the day off to rest his swollen right kne= e. Leaf will have his chance to win the starting job in Dallas, but he has = no real Fantasy value at this time.   Troy Hambrick , RB DAL - Free Agent U= pdated 10/17/01 Now that Robert Thomas is gone for the year, Hambrick is ex= pected to become Dallas' starting fullback. He's shown flashes of brillianc= e at times, but his value as a Fantasy player is still minimal at this poin= t.   Michael Bennett , RB MIN - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01 Bennett is list= ed as doubtful for Sunday's game against Green Bay due to a right ankle inj= ury. Expect Doug Chapman to get the start, with Travis Prentice serving as = his backup. Don't use Bennett this week.  Randy Moss , WR MIN - Hunter Shiv= ely Updated 10/17/01 Moss is listed as questionable for Sunday's game again= st Green Bay with a right ankle injury. While we normally tell you to start=  him every week, this is one matchup we wouldn't activate him for unless it=  becomes completely clear he will start.  Shane Matthews , QB CHI - Free Ag= ent Updated 10/17/01 The Bears re-signed Matthews on Tuesday. He returns to=  his old backup QB job and isn't worth adding to your Fantasy roster.  Terr= ell Davis , RB DEN - Eric Bass Updated 10/17/01 According to published repo= rts, Davis would like to return to the lineup! S! unday at San Diego. He ha= s recovered from a knee injury, and Broncos Head Coach Mike Shanahan wants = him to return by November 4. We don't recommend you use Davis this week, al= though this development also makes it tough to recommend you start any Bron= cos running back.   Stacey Mack , RB JAC - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01 Mack=  will get a lot of carries this week but don't expect him to be too product= ive. He only gained 17 yards on nine carries in the Jaguars' previous.   Ke= enan McCardell , WR JAC - Tori Kuykendall Updated 10/17/01 McCardell strugg= led in his first few games back from injury, but looked like his old self i= n the previous game. Look for McCardell to play well this week and catch a = lot of passes.    Sean Dawkins , WR JAC - Hunter Shively Updated 10/17/01 D= awkins will have a tough time against Buffalo this week. He will catch of c= ouple of passes but won't find his way into the end zone.   Mark Brunell , = QB JAC - Top Dogs Updated 10/17/01 Brunell is no longer being bothered by h= eadaches and is expected to play in Week Six. Look for him to throw for ove= r 200 yards and a score.     Kyle Brady , TE JAC - Free Agent Updated 10/17= /01 Brady is expected to play in this week's game despite a hip injury, and=  is listed as probable. He w! on! 't be too productive if he does play. Bra= dy only has five catches this season.   Jimmy Smith , WR JAC - Fear Updated=  10/17/01 Smith has been very consistent this season. Look for him to catch=  several passes and score a touchdown against Buffalo.  Herman Moore , WR D= ET - McKay Neal Updated 10/17/01 Moore will miss the remainder of the seaso= n after tearing a muscle in his hip during Sunday's game at Minnesota. ""We'= re disappointed the injury is much worse than we thought,"" Lions Head Coach=  Marty Mornhinweg said. ""We believed it was a minor pull, but the MRI showe= d a significant tear in the muscle."" Drop Moore if he was on your Fantasy t= eam. Larr! y ! Foster assumes the No. 3 receiver job in Detroit.  Tyrone Wh= eatley , RB OAK - Tori Kuykendall Updated 10/17/01 According to published r= eports, Wheatley will miss three to four weeks with a right knee sprain. Th= e veteran back was beginning to lose carries to Charlie Garner before he wa= s hurt.  Charlie Garner , RB OAK - Hunter Shively Updated 10/17/01 The Cont= ra-Costa Times points out Garner has apparently supplanted Tyrone Wheatley = as the team's ""workhorse"" back. The trend was apparent before Wheatley was = reported to miss three to four weeks with a knee injury.  More Updates  Pla= yer News Teams  [IMAGE]  Matt Lenhart Player News  Eric Moulds , Active WR = Updated 10/18/01 Moulds might get in the end zone against Jacksonville. Loo= k for the Bills to move him around often against the injury-riddled Jaguars=  secondary.  Peerless Price , Reserve WR Updated 10/18/01 Price might post = respectable numbers against the Jaguars. Jacksonville's secondary is thin b= ecause of injuries.  Kerry Collins , Reserve QB Updated 10/14/01 Collins co= mpleted 18-of-32 passes for 250 yards and a touchdown on Sunday against St.=  Louis. However, he's still not a reliable starter Fantasy-wise despite his=  decent numbers against the Rams.   Stephen Davis , Active RB Updated 10/14= /01 According to the Washington Post, coach Marty Schottenheimer will give = Davis more carries on Monday against Dallas. Davis has struggled thus far, = but it's been less about him and more about the Redskins tendency to fall b= ehind the opposition early in games. If ever there was a week to start Davi= s, this is it.   Johnnie Morton , Reserve WR Updated 10/12/01 Morton has de= veloped into the Lions' No. 1 receiver this season, and is worth taking a c= hance on against Minnesota's mediocre secondary. If you pay in a deeper lea= gue and don't have more reliable options, Morton is definittly worth consid= ering this week.   Cris Carter , Active WR Updated 10/12/01 Carter has stru= ggled, but he's too good not to start on a weekly basis. Look for him to fi= nd the end zone against Detroit on Sunday.   Isaac Bruce , Active WR Update= d 10/12/01 Bruce hasn't been very consistent thus far, but he's far too tal= ented to ever consider benching. Look for him to turn things around against=  CB Jason Sehorn and the questionable N.Y. Giants secondary.   Corey Dillon=  , Active RB Updated 10/12/01 Look for Dillon to have mixed success this we= ek. The Browns defense will make it difficult to run but his effort as a re= ceiver will be enough to give him a productive week.   Rickey Dudley , Rese= rve TE Updated 10/09/01 The Browns have placed Dudley on injured reserve wi= th a foot injury, officially ending his season. Drop him if he was on your = Fantasy roster.  Tony Banks , Reserve QB Updated 10/07/01 Banks was horribl= e against the N.Y. Giants, completing 13-of-31 for only 151 yards and two i= nterceptions. At this point, Banks isn't even worth a roster spot outside o= f deeper leagues.   Steve Beuerlein , Active QB Updated 10/05/01 The Bronco= s placed Beuerlein on injured reserve on Friday, ending his season. He has = been healing slowly from an offseason elbow injury, and isn't worth holding=  on to if you had him as insurance to Brian Griese in your league.  Dolphin= s , Active DT Updated 10/02/01 Linebacker Zach Thomas suffered a partially = torn medial collateral ligament in his left knee during Sunday's loss to St= . Louis. ""It's just real sore,"" Thomas told the Miami Herald. ""I'm going to=  try to play [Sunday]."" His knee is very stiff right now, however, so don't=  be surprised if Thomas misses this weekend's AFC East contest against New = England.   Raiders , Reserve DT Updated 10/02/01 The Raiders have lost DE T= race Armstrong for the rest of the season after he tore his Achilles' tendo= n in Sunday's game against Seattle. He'll have surgery this week and be pla= ced on the injured reserve list shortly thereafter. In other news, DT Roder= ick Coleman is doubtful for Sunday's game against the Dallas Cowboys after = sustaining a hamstring injury, and DT Grady Jackson is questionable for Sun= day after aggravating an injury to his right shoulder.   Matt Stover , Acti= ve K Updated 12/08/00 Stover needs just nine more field goals over the fina= l three weeks of the season to break the NFL single-season record of 39 (Ol= indo Mare, 1999). Expect him to get plenty of chances against San Diego on = Sunday, and ensure that he's in your active playoff lineup each week.

Reserve=  Heap on your roster this week. It would be wise to keep him inactive until=  he is effective in a game.   Jeff Garcia , QB SF - The Guzzlers Updated 10= /18/01 According to published reports, Garcia has been instructed not to pi= ck up a football until the Niners begin practicing again next week. Garcia = is dealing with a sore throwing elbow,! a! s well as a few other nagging bu= mps and bruises. However, he's still expected to start in the 49ers' next g= ame on Oct. 28 against Chicago.   Peerless Price , WR BUF - The Lie Downs U= pdated 10/18/01 Price might post respectable numbers against the Jaguars. J= acksonville's secondary is thin because of injuries.  Eric Moulds , WR BUF = - Who's Yo Daddy Updated 10/18/01 Moulds might get in the end zone against = Jacksonville. Look for the Bills to move him around often against the injur= y-riddled Jaguars secondary.  Larry Centers , RB BUF -! T! he Guzzlers Upda= ted 10/18/01 Centers has been Buffalo's most reliable receiver so far, but = that trend might change against Jacksonville. Buffalo might look to attack = an injury-riddled Jaguars secondary with passes to WR Peerless Price and TE=  Jay Riemersma.  Drew Bledsoe , QB NE - The Executioners Updated 10/18/01 T= here's a very slim chance Bledsoe will be in uniform as the emergency quart= erback this week .     Bledsoe was upgraded from ""out"" to ""doubtful"" on the=  injury report, but he's lost 15 pounds and hasn't been cleared to run, thr= ow or be hit. He has pedaled a stationary bicycle and probably would just h= and off the ball if Brady and No. 2 quarterback Damon Huard are sidelined. =   Bledsoe's progress has been slower than he hoped and there's no timetable=  for his return.   !   Tyrone Wheatley , RB OAK - One Man Show Updated 10/1= 8/01 Wheatley won't practice during the team's week off and could possibly = miss the next game because of an injured right knee.          ""Tyrone Wheat= ley has a second degree - I don't know if it's a sprain or a tear - of his = MCL,""' coach Jon Gruden said Wednesday.   Gruden called Wheatley questionab= le for the Oct. 28 game at Philadelphia. He said he would learn more about = the injury as the week progressed.   He disputed reports that Wheatley woul= d be out four weeks.   ""I would not agree with that at this time,"" Gruden s= aid.     Chris Weinke , QB CAR - The Lie Downs Updated 10/18/01 Weinke sat = out practice Wednesday and it's uncert! ai! n whether he will play in Washi= ngton on Sunday because of a thigh injury. The injury is more serious than = the Panthers first expected. Seifert said Monday that Weinke had a deep thi= gh bruise, but expected him to practice Wednesday. Seifert said he didn't k= now if Weinke would practice Thursday. Dameyune Craig would start if Weinke=  cannot play.   Brian Griese , QB DEN - The Nice Machine Updated 10/18/01 G= riese said Wednesday his sore shoulder has improved and he's confident he'l= l play Sunday against San Diego.   Griese complained of shoulder soreness a= fter a hit against the Kansas City Chiefs on Oct. 7. The problem was aggrav= ated Sunday when he was slammed to the turf by Seattle Seahawks defensive e= nd Lamar King.   Tests Monday showed no structural damage to his shoulder. =     Redskins , DT WAS - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01 Cornerback Champ Bailey=  missed practice on Wednesday due to a sprai! ne! d ankle, but he's expecte= d to play on Sunday. Fred Smoot (leg), however, is in danger of missing thi= s weekend's contest against Carolina. Darrell Green would replace Smoot if = he's unable to go.   Rob Moore , WR ARI - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01 Moore=  (hamstring) is listed as probable for Sunday's game against Kansas City. H= e hasn't been full speed at practice, however, so don't be surprised if his=  status is downgraded over the next two days.   Patrick Jeffers , WR CAR - = oops, I did it again Updated 10/17/01 Jeffers (knees) saw extensive work in=  practice today and may be ready to play this weekend against New Orleans. = However, Jeffers is too risky to start from a Fantasy perspective.   Muhsin=  Muhammad , WR CAR - The Nice Machine Updated 10/17/01 Muhammad's ribs are = still sore after taking a few shots during Sunday's game against New Orlean= s. Coach George Seifert expects him to play, but he may be somewhat limited= . Unless his status improves by the end of the week, Fantasy owners may wan= t to consider benching Muhammad if at all possible.   Chris Weinke , QB CAR=  - The Lie Downs Updated 10/17/01 Weinke missed practice on Wednesday due t= o a thigh injury. However, Head Coach George Seifert expects the rookie qua= rterback to start on Sunday against Washington. If you need a quarterback t= his week, Weinke is a good choice facing a terrible Redskins' defense. !  T= erance Mathis , WR ATL - North Blvd Nutwhackers Updated 10/17/01 Mathis (ha= nd) returned to practice on Wednesday. He is expected to start on Sunday ag= ainst New Orleans, but he's only worth starting in deeper leagues from a Fa= ntasy perspective.   Shawn Jefferson , WR ATL - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01=  Jefferson (toe) returned to practice on Wednesday. He is expected to be in=  the starting lineup on Sunday against New Orleans, but he's too unreliable=  to use Fantasy-wise.   Ryan Leaf , QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01!  = Leaf worked with he first team offense during practice on Wednesday. He was=  filling in for Anthony Wright, who was given the day off to rest his swoll= en right knee. Leaf will have his chance to win the starting job in Dallas,=  but he has no real Fantasy value at this time.   Troy Hambrick , RB DAL - = Free Agent Updated 10/17/01 Now that Robert Thomas is gone for the year, Ha= mbrick is expected to become Dallas' starting fullback. He's shown flashes = of brilliance at times, but his value as a Fantasy player is still minimal = at this point.   Michael Bennett , RB MIN - The Fat Bastards Updated 10! /1= ! 7/01 Bennett is listed as doubtful for Sunday's game against Green Bay du= e to a right ankle injury. Expect Doug Chapman to get the start, with Travi= s Prentice serving as his backup. Don't use Bennett this week.  Randy Moss = , WR MIN - Meximullets Updated 10/17/01 Moss is listed as questionable for = Sunday's game against Green Bay with a right ankle injury. While we normall= y tell you to start him every week, this is one matchup we wouldn't activat= e him for unless it becomes completely clear he will start.  Shane Matthews=  , QB CHI - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01 The Bears re-signed Matthews on Tue= sday. He returns to his old backup QB job and isn't worth adding to your Fa= ntasy roster.  Terrell Davis , RB DEN - Meximullets Updated 10/17/01 Accord= ing to published reports, Davis would like to return to the lineup Sunday a= t San Diego. He has recovered from a knee injury, and Broncos Head Coach Mi= ke Shanahan wants him to return by November 4. We don't recommend you use D= avis this week, although this development also makes it tough to recommend = you start any Broncos running back.  Stacey Mack , RB JAC - Thrill Kill Cul= t Updated 10/17/01  Mack will get a lot of carries this week but don't expe= ct him to be too productive. He only gained 17 yards on nine carries in the=  Jaguars' previous.   Keenan McCardell , WR JAC - One Man Show Updated 10/1= 7/01 McCardell struggled in his first few games back from injury, but looke= d like his old self in the previous game. Look for McCardell to play well t= his week and catch a lot of passes.    Sean Dawkins , WR JAC - Free Agent U= pdated 10/17/01 Dawkins will have a tough time against Buffalo this week. H= e will catch of couple of passes but won't! f! ind his way into the end zon= e.   Mark Brunell , QB JAC - The Nice Machine Updated 10/17/01 Brunell is n= o longer being bothered by headaches and is expected to play in Week Six. L= ook for him to throw for over 200 yards and a score.     Kyle Brady , TE JA= C - One Man Show Updated 10/17/01 Brady is expected to play in this week's = game despite a hip injury, and is listed as probable. He won't be too produ= ctive if he does play. Brady only has five catches this season.   Jimmy Smi= th , WR JAC - North Blvd Nutwhackers Updated 10/17/01 Smith has been very c= onsistent this season. Look for him to catch several passes and score a tou= chdown against Buffalo.  Herman Moore , WR DET - Free Agent Updated 10/17/0= 1 Moore will miss the remainder of the season after tearing a muscle in his=  hip during Sunday's game at Minnesota. ""We're disappointed the injury is m= uch worse than we thought,"" Lions Head Coach Marty Mornhinweg said. ""We bel= ieved it was a minor pull, but the MRI showed a significant tear in the mus= cle."" Drop Moore if he was on your Fantasy team. Larry Foster assumes the N= o. 3 receiver job in Detroit.  ! Ty! rone Wheatley , RB OAK - One Man Show = Updated 10/17/01 According to published reports, Wheatley will miss three t= o four weeks with a right knee sprain. The veteran back was beginning to lo= se carries to Charlie Garner before he was hurt.

But the = Chiefs might depend on the run, so his numbers may be limited.  Ken Dilger = , TE IND - Free Agent Updated 10/18/01 Dilger is not a major factor in the = Indianapolis passing game anymore. Don't expect much from him against the u= nderrated New England defense this week.  Marcus Pollard  , TE IND - Free A= gent Updated 10/18/01 Pollard has emerged as Indianpolis' top option at tig= ht end. He will once again be a key factor in the passing game against New = England this week,  Edgerrin James , RB IND - JWillie Updated 10/18/01 Jame= s was held to just 55 rushing yards in his first game against New England t= his year. Expect much better numbers on James' home turf this week.  Reggie=  Wayne , WR IND - Free Agent Updated 10/18/01 Wayne is expected to start in=  place o! f ! the injured Jerome Pathon for the second consecutive week. Wa= yne has not done much yet, so don't put him in your Fantasy lineup.   Marvi= n Harrison , WR IND - Russell Updated 10/18/01 Harrison suually performs we= ll in divisional matchups, and has burned Patriots CB Ty Law in the past. E= xpect him to produce good numbers against New England.  Peyton Manning , QB=  IND - Neal/McKay Updated 10/18/01 Manning did not perform well the first t= ime he faced New England. He was intercepted by the Patriots three times, b= ut should perform better against them at home this week.  Randy Moss , WR M= IN - Russell Updated 10/18/01  Moss did not participate in practice Wednesd= ay due to his sore right ankle. He should be able to practice on Thursday a= nd play Sunday against Green Bay, but hold off deciding on whether to use h= im until it's clear whether he will be able to play.  Bill Schroeder , WR G= B - Frank Updated 10/18/01 Schroeder missed practice Wednesday with an ankl= e injury. He is receiving treatment and should play Sunday, but monitor his=  progress before deciding whether to use him this week.  Terry Glenn , WR N= E - Matty Updated 10/18/01 Glenn might have another good game this week. In= dianapolis' secondary might have trouble handling Glenn, who immediately pr= oved an early-season layoff didn't hurt him last week.  Antowain Smith , RB=  NE - JWillie Updated 10/18/01 Smith rushed for 94 yards and two TDs the fi= rst time he faced the Colts this year. Expect him to get in the end zone at=  least once this week, in his second meeting with Indianapolis.  Wayne Chre= bet , WR NYJ - JWillie Updated 10/18/01 Chrebet's numbers have been very di= sappointing so far. He could have a good week i! f ! the Jets engage in a s= hootout with the Rams. He is still a risky start, because New York will cen= ter its gameplan around Curtis Martin.   Laveranues Coles , WR NYJ - JWilli= e Updated 10/18/01 Coles has emerged as a go-to receiver for the Jets, but = might be held down by the Rams. The St. Louis defenive backs should be able=  to match his downfield speed.  Curtis Martin , RB NYJ - Tori Updated 10/18= /01 Martin will be the focal point of the New York offense this week. The J= ets will try to control the ball and the clock against the Rams.   ! Stephe= n Davis , RB WAS - Bass/Hull Updated 10/18/01 Davis had his first decent ga= me of the season on Monday against Dallas, but he's still a very risky Fant= asy player due to Washington's horrible offense. Facing Carolina is an adva= ntageous matchup, however, so starting Davis this week warrants considerati= on.   Tony Banks , QB WAS - Free Agent Updated 10/18/01 Banks was very medi= ocre against Dallas on Monday night, completing 10-of-18 passes for only 13= 2 yards and one touchdown. At this point, Banks isn't even worth a roster s= pot outside of deeper leagues.   Michael Westbrook , WR WAS - Free Agent Up= d! at! ed 10/18/01 Westbrook has been less than mediocre this season, but h= e could have a decent outing against Carolina. He's had some success agains= t the Panthers in the past, but he's still only worth starting in deeper le= agues.   Vinny Testaverde , QB NYJ - Neal/McKay Updated 10/18/01 Testaverde=  might not be a good start this week. The St. Louis defense can be opportun= istic, and could very well make the Jets QB throw his first interception of=  the year.  Walter Rasby , TE WAS - Free Agent Updated 10/18/01 Rasby will = likely get most of the work at tight en! d ! now that Stephen Alexander is = out. However, he warrants no real Fantasy consideration at this point.   Ro= d Gardner , WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 10/18/01 Gardner could have a decen= t game against a questionable Carolina secondary on Monday. He's worth cons= idering as a starter Fantasy-wise, but only in larger leagues.   Torry Holt=  , WR STL - Tori Updated 10/18/01 Holt has the potential to post big number= s against a shaky N.Y. Jets secondary on Sunday. He's a big time Fantasy wi= deout and should be in your starting lineup on a weekly basis.   Isaac Bruc= e , WR STL - Frank Updated 10/18/01 Bruce hasn't been very consistent thus = far, but he's far too talented to ever consider benching. Look for him to t= urn things around against the questionable N.Y. Jets secondary.   Ernie Con= well , TE STL - Free Agent Updated 10/18/01 Conwell has become a decent tig= ht end from a Fantasy perspective this season. He's worth staring on a week= ly basis if you don't have a more reliable tight end on your roster.   Trun= g Canidate , RB STL - Giggles Updated 10/18/01 Canidate wil! l ! likely rep= lace Marshall Faulk as St. Louis' featured back this weekend against the N.= Y. Jets. He has a good knowledge of the Rams' offense and is easily worth s= tarting this week from a Fantasy perspective.   Kurt Warner , QB STL - Hunt= er Updated 10/18/01 Considering the huge numbers he puts up on a consistent=  basis, Warner is a a must-start every week. He'll post another big game ag= ainst the New York Jets on Sunday, so be sure to put him your lineup.   Cor= rell Buckhalter , RB PHI - Free Agent Updated 10/18/01 Buckhalter isn't exp= ected to start, but don't be surprised if he gets the majority of the carri= es on Monday night against the Giants. Coach Andy Reid will start Duce Stal= ey in the backfield, but Buckhalter will likely be the more productive! o! = f the two backs.   Donovan McNabb , QB PHI - Russell Updated 10/18/01 McNab= b is one of the top Fantasy players in the league, and is worth starting on=  a weekly basis. He should beat the Giants for two scores and around 275 ya= rds on Monday night, so be sure to get him into your lineup.   Todd Pinksto= n , WR PHI - Hunter Updated 10/18/01 Pinkston is slowly becoming one of Don= ovan McNabb's favorite targets this season. He's worth starting against the=  Giants, whose secondary is a bit suspect at this point.   Tyrone Wheatley =  , RB OAK - Giggles Updated 10/18/01 The Contra-Costa Times says Wheatley h= as sustained a sprained medial collateral ligament in his right knee. Altho= ugh some sources say Wheatley will miss two to four weeks, Jon Gruden says = Wheatley is questionable for Oct. 28, and is unaware of any prognosis beyon= d that.  Chad Lewis , TE PHI - Free Agent Updated 10/18/01 Lewis will have = a good shot at producing some solid Fantasy numbers on Monday against the N= .Y. Giants.

But the C= hiefs might depend on the run, so his numbers may be limited.  Ken Dilger ,=  TE IND - Free Agent Updated 10/18/01 Dilger is not a major factor in the I= ndianapolis passing game anymore. Don't expect much from him against the un= derrated New England defense this week.  Marcus Pollard  , TE IND - Free Ag= ent Updated 10/18/01 Pollard has emerged as Indianpolis' top option at tigh= t end. He will once again be a key factor in the passing game against New E= ngland this week,  Edgerrin James , RB IND - Martin Cuilla Updated 10/18/01=  James was held to just 55 rushing yards in his first game against New Engl= and this year.

Wayne has not done much yet, so don't put him in your Fantasy lineup.   M= arvin Harrison , WR IND - Eric Bass Updated 10/18/01 Harrison suually perfo= rms well in divisional matchups, and has burned Patriots CB Ty Law in the p= ast. Expect him to produce good numbers against New England.  Peyton Mannin= g , QB IND - Tori Kuykendall Updated 10/18/01 Manning did not perform well = the first time he faced New England. He was intercepted by the Patriots thr= ee times, but should perform better against them at home this week.  Randy = Moss , WR MIN - Hunter Shively Updated 10/18/01 Moss did not participate in=  practice Wednesday due to his sore right ankle. He should be able to pract= ice on Thursday and play Sunday against Green Bay, but hold off deciding on=  whether to use him until it's clear whether he will be able to play.  Bill=  Schroeder , WR GB - Rocks Updated 10/18/01 Schroeder missed practice Wedne= sday with an ankle injury. He is receiving treatment and should play Sunday= , but monitor his progress before deciding whether to use him this week.  T= erry Glenn , WR NE - Tori Kuykendall Updated 10/18/01 Glenn might have anot= her good game this week. Indianapolis' secondary might have trouble handlin= g Glenn, who immediately proved an early-season layoff didn't hurt him last=  week.  Antowain Smith , RB NE - Baja Updated 10/18/01 Smith rushed for 94 = yards and two TDs the first time he faced the Colts this year. Expect him t= o get in the end zone at least once this week, in his second meeting with I= ndianapolis.  Wayne Chrebet , WR NYJ - Fear Updated 10/18/01 Chrebet's numb= ers have been very disappointing so far. He could have a good week if the J= ets! e! ngage in a shootout with the Rams. He is still a risky start, becau= se New York will center its gameplan around Curtis Martin.   Laveranues Col= es , WR NYJ - Hunter Shively Updated 10/18/01 Coles has emerged as a go-to = receiver for the Jets, but might be held down by the Rams. The St. Louis de= fenive backs should be able to match his downfield speed.  Curtis Martin , = RB NYJ - FIBSABs Updated 10/18/01 Martin will be the focal point of the New=  York offense this week. The Jets will try to control the ball and the cloc= k against the Rams.   Stephen Davis , RB WAS - Matt Lenhart Updated 10/18/0= 1 Davis had his first decent game of the season on Monday against Dallas, b= ut he's still a very risky Fantasy player due to Washington's horrible offe= nse. Facing Carolina is an advantageous matchup, however, so starting Davis=  this week warrants consideration.   Tony Banks , QB WAS - Matt Lenhart Upd= ated 10/18/01 Banks was very mediocre against Dallas on Monday night, compl= eting 10-of-18 passes for only 132 yards and one touchdown. At this point, = Banks isn't even worth a roster spot outside of deeper leagues.   Michael W= estbrook , WR WAS - Free Agent Updat! ed! 10/18/01 Westbrook has been less = than mediocre this season, but he could have a decent outing against Caroli= na. He's had some success against the Panthers in the past, but he's still = only worth starting in deeper leagues.   Vinny Testaverde , QB NYJ - Fear U= pdated 10/18/01 Testaverde might not be a good start this week. The St. Lou= is defense can be opportunistic, and could very well make the Jets QB throw=  his first interception of the year.  Walter Rasby , TE WAS - Free Agent Up= dated 10/18/01 Rasby will likely get most of the work at tight end now that= ! S! tephen Alexander is out. However, he warrants no real Fantasy consider= ation at this point.   Rod Gardner , WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 10/18/01 G= ardner could have a decent game against a questionable Carolina secondary o= n Monday. He's worth considering as a starter Fantasy-wise, but only in lar= ger leagues.   Torry Holt , WR STL - Fear Updated 10/18/01 Holt has the pot= ential to post big numbers against a shaky N.Y. Jets secondary on Sunday. H= e's a big time Fantasy wideout and should be in your starting lineup on a w= eekly basis.   Isaac Bruce , WR STL - Matt Lenhart Updated 10/18/01 Bruce h= asn't been very consistent thus far, but he's far too talented to ever cons= ider benching. Look for him to turn things around against the questionable = N.Y. Jets secondary.   Ernie Conwell , TE STL - Free Agent Updated 10/18/01=  Conwell has become a decent tight end from a Fantasy perspective this seas= on. He's worth staring on a weekly basis if you don't have a more reliable = tight end on your roster.   Trung Canidate , RB STL - Free Agent Updated 10= /18/01 Canidate will likely replace Marshall Fa! ul! k as St. Louis' featur= ed back this weekend against the N.Y. Jets. He has a good knowledge of the = Rams' offense and is easily worth starting this week from a Fantasy perspec= tive.   Kurt Warner , QB STL - Baja Updated 10/18/01 Considering the huge n= umbers he puts up on a consistent basis, Warner is a a must-start every wee= k. He'll post another big game against the New York Jets on Sunday, so be s= ure to put him your lineup.   Correll Buckhalter , RB PHI - Free Agent Upda= ted 10/18/01 Buckhalter isn't expected to start, but don't be surprised if = he gets the majority of the carries on Monday night against the Giants. Coa= ch Andy Reid will start Duce Staley in the backfield, but Buckhalter will l= ikely be the more productive of th! e ! two backs.   Donovan McNabb , QB PH= I - Eric Bass Updated 10/18/01 McNabb is one of the top Fantasy players in = the league, and is worth starting on a weekly basis. He should beat the Gia= nts for two scores and around 275 yards on Monday night, so be sure to get = him into your lineup.   Todd Pinkston , WR PHI - Free Agent Updated 10/18/0= 1 Pinkston is slowly becoming one of Donovan McNabb's favorite targets this=  season. He's worth starting against the Giants, whose secondary is a bit s= uspect at this point.   Tyrone Wheatley  , RB OAK - Tori Kuykendall Updated=  10/18/01 The Contra-Costa Times says Wheatley has sustained a sprained med= ial collateral ligament in his right knee. Although some sources say Wheatl= ey will miss two to four weeks, Jon Gruden says Wheatley is questionable fo= r Oct. 28, and is unaware of any prognosis beyond that.  Chad Lewis , TE PH= I - Free Agent Updated 10/18/01 Lewis will have a good shot at producing so= me solid Fantasy numbers on Monday against the N.Y. Giants.

"I am watching the fourth quarter of the 9th Ranked Texas Longhorn as whipping of the 14th ranked Colorado Buffalo. I am very dissapointed - I had one of my to-do's this week was to send you a note to take another $100 of your dollars by giving you the 10 points - it looks like you would have needed 30+ though. Either CU is OVERRATED or more like The Horns are some bad ass hausses. The truth is that The Horns can beat any team in the nation any weekend.  I would enjoy the ass-whipping the Horns would lay on the Cajun Bitches from the Red Stick (lsu sucks).  I guess being a Colorado Coonass means you get punked by the Horns twice - CU and Lousyanna State both being inferior to the Horns.  Hook 'EM    Brian R.

Bradford has yet to prove hims= elf as a Fantasy player.  Bubba Franks , TE GB - Free Agent Updated 10/21/0= 1 Franks caught only two passes for nine yards, but one of his receptions w= as good for a two-yard TD. Franks has caught TD passes in five of six games=  this year and has become a major sco! ri! ng threat even though he is not = very effective outside of the red zone.  Derrick Alexander , WR KC - JWilli= e Updated 10/21/01 Alexander finally had a big game, posting 99 yards recei= ving and a touchdown against Arizona. He's been unreliable for the most par= t, however, but his potential to post numbers this good makes it tough to b= ench him.   Trent Green , QB KC - Bass/Hull Updated 10/21/01 Green threw fo= r 352 yards and a score in Sunday's 24-16 loss to Arizona. Green has been i= nconsistent this season, however, and no longer warrants a starting nod eve= ry week.   Doug Chapman  , RB MIN - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01 Chapman rus= hed for 90 yards on 22 carries against the Packers. His numbers were not gr= eat, but he was more effective than Michael Bennett has been so far. Chapma= n may continue to see a good amount of carries if Bennett cannot stay healt= hy or continues to struggle.  David Boston , WR ARI - Bass/Hull Updated 10/= 21/01 Boston had a big game against Kansas City, posting seven receptions f= or 131 yards and a score. He's emerging as one of the best receivers in the=  league and is worth starting on a weekly basis.   ! Michael Pittman , RB A= RI - Matty Updated 10/21/01 Pittman had a great outing on Sunday against Ka= nsas City, posting 137 yards of total offense and a touchdown. Pittman won'= t post numbers this good with any regularity, but he's still a valuable pla= yer to have on your roster.   Jeff Graham , WR SD - Free Agent Updated 10/2= 1/01 Graham came up huge for San Diego on Sunday, catching seven passes for=  107 yards and two scores against Denver. He's still not reliable enough to=  start on a regular basis, but he's certainly worth a roster spot.   LaDain= ian Tomlinson , RB SD - Hunter Updated 10/21/01 ! Tomlinson was held in che= ck for the first time this season by Denver on Sunday. The rookie tailback = rushed for only 58 yards on the day, but he's still one of the top Fantasy = players in the league.   Desmond Clark , TE DEN - Free Agent Updated 10/21/= 01 Clark had a big game on Sunday, catching six passes for 54 yards and a s= core against San Diego. He's been reliable as far as tight ends go from a F= antasy perspective, so continue to start him on a weekly basis.   Brian Gri= ese , QB DEN - Matty Updated 10/21/01 Griese (shoulder) started Sun! da! y'= s game against San Diego, but he was ineffective. He posted 212 yards passi= ng, a touchdown and two interceptions in Denver's 27-10 loss.   Peter Warri= ck , WR CIN - Giggles Updated 10/21/01 Warrick caught eight passes for 84 y= ards against Chicago. But the potentially explosive wideout is hurting his = owners, because he does not find the end zone often.   Corey Dillon , RB CI= N - Frank Updated 10/21/01 The Bears held Dillon to just 30 yards on 16 car= ries. Expect the veteran runner to bounce back from such a quiet performanc= e very quickly.  David Terrell , WR CHI - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01 Terre= ll caught seven passes for 91 yards against Cincinnati. With Marcus Robinso= n injured, Terrell should assume a more prominent role in the Chicago passi= ng game.  Anthony Thomas , RB CHI - Martin Updated 10/21/01 Thomas rushed f= or 188 yards and a TD against Cincinnati, clearly establishing himself as C= hicago's top RB. Expect him to be the Bears' featured back for the rest of = the year.  Frank Wycheck , TE TEN - Matty Updated 10/21/01 Wycheck caught s= even passes for 100 yards and a TD at Detroit! . ! Despite some quiet outin= gs until this week, he remains a top-notch Fantasy TE, especially with the = Titans lacking in talent at wide receiver.   Charlie Batch , QB DET - Free = Agent Updated 10/21/01 Batch threw for 338 yards, three TDs and was interce= pted once in a loss to Tennessee. Batch has stacked up good numbers in two = consecutive weeks, but he remains a Fantasy risk because of his history of = inconsistency.  Steve McNair , QB TEN - Martin Updated 10/21/01 McNair thre= w for 216 yards, a TD and was intercepted twice at Detroit. He completed on= ly 15 of 35 attempts, and many of his throws were inaccurate, possibly indi= cating he still might be bothered by shoulder problems.!  Eddie George , RB=  TEN - Tori Updated 10/21/01 George was held to 51 yards on 26 carries by D= etroit. The lack of a reliable passing game in Tennessee has certainly hind= ered his production this year.   Shawn Jefferson , WR ATL - Free Agent Upda= ted 10/21/01 Jefferson caught three passes for 67 yards and a TD against th= e Saints. The speedy wideout has a long history of inconsistency, so don't = expect good numbers from him every week.  Alge Crumpler , TE ATL - Free Age= nt Updated 10/21/01 Crumpler caught five passes for 78 yards and a TD again= st New Orleans. Expect good totals from the big, quick tight end for the re= mainder of the year.  Albert Connell , WR NO - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01 = Connell caught only one pass for five yards against Atlanta. It is definite= ly time to give up on the disappointing wideout.  Willie Jackson , WR NO - = Martin Updated 10/21/01 Jackson finished with only 46 receiving yards on fi= ve catches against the Falcons. Mediocre numbers against the low-quality At= lanta defense indicate Jackson is not ca! pa! ble of providing owners with = regularly good numbers.  Hines Ward , WR PIT - Tori Updated 10/21/01 Ward w= as limited to 44 yards on three catches by Tampa Bay. Ward is still making = important receptions for the Steelers, but his Fantasy appeal is limited be= cause of Pittsburgh's inability to consistently score in the air.  Warrick = Dunn , RB TB - Martin Updated 10/21/01 Dunn played despite a foot injury th= at had bothered him during the week, but he was limited to 31 yards on 13 c= arries by a physical Pittsburgh defense.  Anthony Becht , TE NYJ - Free Age= nt Updated 10/21/01 Becht had a huge game against St. Louis, posting five c= atches for 35 yards and two scores. He's been inconsistent this season, how= ever, but his potential to post good numbers makes him worth starting at a = position lacking quality players.   Keyshawn Johnson , WR TB - Giggles Upda= ted 10/21/01 Johnson caught 10 passes for 159 yards against Pittsburgh. He = has developed a good on-field relationship with QB Brad Johnson. The vetera= n wideout should continue to post high-quality numbers on a regular basis. =  Jerome Bettis , RB PIT - Giggles Updated 10/21/01 Bettis rushed for 143 ya= rds and a TD on 17 carries against Tampa Bay. He also threw a 32-yard TD pa= ss. His fine outing proves Bettis can compile good numbers against any defe= nse.  Trung Canidate , RB STL - Giggles Updated 10/21/01 Canidate had a hug= e game against the New York Jets, posting 232 yards of total offense and tw= o scores. His role as the Rams' featured back may be short-lived, however, = depending on the health of stud back Marshall Faulk.   Rod Gardner , WR WAS=  - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01 Gardner had a huge game on Sunday, p! os! ti= ng six catches for 208 yards and a score against Carolina. He seems to have=  overtaken Michael Westbrook as the No. 1 receiving target in Washington, a= nd is worth a roster spot from a Fantasy perspective.

Dear  Abby ,  I met Laurie at a singles dance.  I knew as soon as I looked at her that she  was too young for me. I'm 49 and she was 32 , 17 years my junior. I really  regretted it because we got along so well that evening. She made me feel so  comfortable in her presence.  Our age difference didn't seem to matter to  her as much as it did to me.  Abby, I told her I felt people were staring at us.  I said they are probably  wondering if I am your father.  She thought I was being silly and said if I  wanted to see her again she would be honored to go out with me.  Laurie and I have been dating now for three months.  I really like her and I  think she likes me.  Still, everywhere we go, I feel people watching us.  Sometimes they just outright stare.  It is very annoying and I know it is  because of our age difference that draws these prolonged looks from everyone  we meet.  I just feel so uncomfortable about this whole thing and wonder if  I should continue with the relationship. Why do people have to be so  rude....?  Sincerely,  John  PS: I have attached a picture of Laurie.                   ",t..lucci@enron.com,matthew.lenhart@enron.com,RE: Dear Abby.......,2001-10-22 06:11:13-07:00,sent

Franks has caught TD passes in five of six games=  this year and has become a major scoring! t! hreat even though he is not v= ery effective outside of the red zone.  Derrick Alexander , WR KC - Martin = Cuilla Updated 10/21/01 Alexander finally had a big game, posting 99 yards = receiving and a touchdown against Arizona. He's been unreliable for the mos= t part, however, but his potential to post numbers this good makes it tough=  to bench him.   Trent Green , QB KC - The Klap Updated 10/21/01 Green thre= w for 352 yards and a score in Sunday's 24-16 loss to Arizona. Green has be= en inconsistent this season, however, and no longer warrants a starting nod=  every week.   Doug Chapman  , RB MIN - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01 Chapman=  rushed for 90 yards on 22 carries against the Packers. His numbers were no= t great, but he was more effective than Michael Bennett has been so far. Ch= apman may continue to see a good amount of carries if Bennett cannot stay h= ealthy or continues to struggle.  David Boston , WR ARI - The Klap Updated = 10/21/01 Boston had a big game against Kansas City, posting seven reception= s for 131 yards and a score. He's emerging as one of the best receivers in = the league and is worth starting on a weekly basis.   Mic! ha! el Pittman ,=  RB ARI - Martin Cuilla Updated 10/21/01 Pittman had a great outing on Sund= ay against Kansas City, posting 137 yards of total offense and a touchdown.=  Pittman won't post numbers this good with any regularity, but he's still a=  valuable player to have on your roster.   Jeff Graham , WR SD - Martin Cui= lla Updated 10/21/01 Graham came up huge for San Diego on Sunday, catching = seven passes for 107 yards and two scores against Denver. He's still not re= liable enough to start on a regular basis, but he's certainly worth a roste= r spot.   LaDainian Tomlinson , RB SD - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01 Tomlins= on was held in check for the first time this season by Denver on Sunday. Th= e rookie tailback rushed for only 58 yards on the day, but he's still one o= f the top Fantasy players in the league.   Desmond Clark , TE DEN - Free Ag= ent Updated 10/21/01 Clark had a big game on Sunday, catching six passes fo= r 54 yards and a score against San Diego. He's been reliable as far as tigh= t ends go from a Fantasy perspective, so continue to start him on a weekly = basis.   Brian Griese , QB DEN - Fear Updated 10/21/01 Griese (shoulder) st= arted Sunday's! g! ame against San Diego, but he was ineffective. He posted=  212 yards passing, a touchdown and two interceptions in Denver's 27-10 los= s.   Peter Warrick , WR CIN - Top Dogs Updated 10/21/01 Warrick caught eigh= t passes for 84 yards against Chicago. But the potentially explosive wideou= t is hurting his owners, because he does not find the end zone often.   Cor= ey Dillon , RB CIN - Matt Lenhart Updated 10/21/01 The Bears held Dillon to=  just 30 yards on 16 carries. Expect the veteran runner to bounce back from=  such a quiet performance very quickly.  David Terrell , WR CHI - Free Agen= t Updated 10/21/01 Terrell caught seven passes for 91 yards against Cincinn= ati. With Marcus Robinson injured, Terrell should assume a more prominent r= ole in the Chicago passing game.  Anthony Thomas , RB CHI - Free Agent Upda= ted 10/21/01 Thomas rushed for 188 yards and a TD against Cincinnati, clear= ly establishing himself as Chicago's top RB. Expect him to be the Bears' fe= atured back for the rest of the year.  Frank Wycheck , TE TEN - Free Agent = Updated 10/21/01 Wycheck caught seven passes for 100 yards and a TD at De! = tr! oit. Despite some quiet outings until this week, he remains a top-notch=  Fantasy TE, especially with the Titans lacking in talent at wide receiver.=    Charlie Batch , QB DET - Rocks Updated 10/21/01 Batch threw for 338 yard= s, three TDs and was intercepted once in a loss to Tennessee. Batch has sta= cked up good numbers in two consecutive weeks, but he remains a Fantasy ris= k because of his history of inconsistency.  Steve McNair , QB TEN - Rocks U= pdated 10/21/01 McNair threw for 216 yards, a TD and was intercepted twice = at Detroit. He completed only 15 of 35 attempts, and many of his throws wer= e inaccurate, possibly indicating he still might be bothered by shoulder pr= oblems.  Eddie George, RB TEN - Fear Updated 10/21/01 George was held to 51=  yards on 26 carries by Detroit. The lack of a reliable passing game in Ten= nessee has certainly hindered his production this year.   Shawn Jefferson ,=  WR ATL - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01 Jefferson caught three passes for 67 = yards and a TD against the Saints. The speedy wideout has a long history of=  inconsistency, so don't expect good numbers from him every week.  Alge Cru= mpler , TE ATL - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01  Crumpler caught five passes f= or 78 yards and a TD against New Orleans. Expect good totals from the big, = quick tight end for the remainder of the year.  Albert Connell , WR NO - Fr= ee Agent Updated 10/21/01 Connell caught only one pass for five yards again= st Atlanta. It is definitely time to give up on the disappointing wideout. =  Willie Jackson , WR NO - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01 Jackson finished with=  only 46 receiving yards on five catches against the Falcons. Mediocre numb= ers against the low-quality Atlanta defense indicate Jackson is not ca! pa!=  ble of providing owners with regularly good numbers.  Hines Ward , WR PIT = - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01 Ward was limited to 44 yards on three catches=  by Tampa Bay. Ward is still making important receptions for the Steelers, = but his Fantasy appeal is limited because of Pittsburgh's inability to cons= istently score in the air.  Warrick Dunn , RB TB - Hunter Shively Updated 1= 0/21/01 Dunn played despite a foot injury that had bothered him during the = week, but he was limited to 31 yards on 13 carries by a physical Pittsburgh=  defense.  Anthony Becht  , TE NYJ - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01 Becht had = a huge game against St. Louis, posting five catches for 35 yards and two sc= ores. He's been inconsistent this season, however, but his potential to pos= t good numbers makes him worth starting at a position lacking quality playe= rs.   Keyshawn Johnson , WR TB - Top Dogs Updated 10/21/01 Johnson caught 1= 0 passes for 159 yards against Pittsburgh. He has developed a good on-field=  relationship with QB Brad Johnson. The veteran wideout should continue to = post high-quality numbers on a regular basis.  Jerome Bet! ti!  , RB PIT - = Fear Updated 10/21/01 Bettis rushed for 143 yards and a TD on 17 carries ag= ainst Tampa Bay. He also threw a 32-yard TD pass. His fine outing proves Be= ttis can compile good numbers against any defense.  Trung Canidate , RB STL=  - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01 Canidate had a huge game against the New Yor= k Jets, posting 232 yards of total offense and two scores. His role as the = Rams' featured back may be short-lived, however, depending on the health of=  stud back Marshall Faulk.   Rod Gardner , WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 10/2= 1/01 Gardner had a huge game on Sunday, po! st! ing six catches for 208 yar= ds and a score against Carolina. He seems to have overtaken Michael Westbro= ok as the No. 1 receiving target in Washington, and is worth a roster spot = from a Fantasy perspective.

I am very dissapointed - I had one of my to-do's this week was to send you a note to take another $100 of your dollars by giving you the 10 points - it looks like you would have needed 30+ though. Either CU is OVERRATED or more like The Horns are some bad ass hausses. The truth is that The Horns can beat any team in the nation any weekend.  I would enjoy the ass-whipping the Horns would lay on the Cajun Bitches from the Red Stick (lsu sucks).  I guess being a Colorado Coonass means you get punked by the Horns twice - CU and Lousyanna State both being inferior to the Horns.  Hook 'EM    Brian R.

Kevin Dyson, WR TEN -=  Bass/Hull Updated 10/23/01Dyson is recovering from a thumb injury but is e= xpected to play in Monday's game against the Steelers. He is expected to pa= rticipate in practice. Eddie George , RB TEN - Tori Updated 10/23/01 George=  suffered a thumb injury in Sunday's game. He is expected to play in this w= eek's game.   Steve McNair , QB TEN - Martin Updated 10/23/01 McNair is suf= fering from a sore ankle as a result of a play in Sunday's game. However, h= e is expected to play in this week's game.   Chris Sanders  , WR TEN - Free=  Agent Updated 10/23/01 The Tennessean reports that Sanders has a disc prob= lem in his back. The reserve receiver is expected to see a specialist this = week. Treatment options consist of rest, an injection, or surgery. Don't ex= pect Sanders to play anytime soon. Rookie Drew Bennett will play in his abs= ence.   Damon Jones , TE JAC - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Jones is expecte= d to resume practicing on Wednesday. An MRI on his shoulder showed that his=  injury would not require surgery.   Fred Taylor , RB JAC - Martin Updated = 10/23/01 Taylor has been ruled out of Sunday's game against Baltimore and h= is status for next week's game remains uncertain. ""All I know is that, from=  week to week, they increase his exercises and change of direction,"" head c= oach Tom Coughlin told The Florida Times-Union. ""It remains to be seen when=  Fred will be able to play. Progress is slow. I'm hoping he responds well t= his week, then we can make some kind of legitimate guess [about a return da= te] next week."" Taylor has been inactive since severely injuring his groin = on Sept 23.     Dennis Northcutt , WR CLE - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Nor= thcutt left Sunday's game because of a concussion. He is expected to play w= hen the Browns return to action next week.   Todd Heap , TE BAL - Free Agen= t Updated 10/23/01 Heap did not play Sunday but head coach Brian Billick to= ld The Baltimore Sun he is optimistic that the rookie will play in this wee= k's game. Heap has been inactive for the last four games because of a sprai= ned ankle.   Terry Allen , RB BAL - Tori Updated 10/23/01 Allen, who left a= fter the fifth play of Sunday's game with a sprained ankle, is questionable=  for this week's game. Jason Brookins will start at running back if Allen i= s inactive.   Elvis Grbac , QB BAL - Tori Updated 10/23/01 Coach Brian Bill= ick expects Grbac to be ready for Sunday's game against Jacksonville, but t= he quarterback wasn't so sure. ""I'm day-to-day. I'm feeling pretty sore in = the chest area,"" Grbac said Monday. ""There could be something going on with=  the cartilage. I haven't picked up a ball or thrown a ball, so we'll just = have to wait and see."" Randall Cunningham will replace Grbac if he is unabl= e to play.     Az-Zahir Hakim , WR STL - Neal/McKay Updated 10/23/01 Hakim = suffered a calf injury during Sunday's blowout win over the New York Jets. = However, he is expected to be available for this weekend's game against New=  Orleans.   Trung Canidate , RB STL - Giggles Updated 10/23/01 According to=  the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, Canidate is expected to start in place of Mar= shall Faulk this weekend against New Orleans. ""I wouldn't expect Marshall t= o be up for this game,"" coach Mike Martz said. ""He's got to be 100 percent = before I would be convinced that we've got to let him play. And if he's not= , then he doesn't play."" Canidate proved himself as a worthy replacement la= st Sunday against the Jets, and should be starting from a Fantasy perspecti= ve again this week.     J.J. Stokes , WR SF - Matty Updated 10/23/01 Stokes=  spent much of the bye week tending to his injured legs, and is close to be= ing completely healthy. ""Thankfully the bye week came so early. It was a bl= essing for me because I was a! bl! e to get treatment every day,"" Stokes to= ld the Contra Costa Times . ""I practiced today good. I wouldn't say I'm 100=  percent but I'm darn close."" Stokes has been less than mediocre, however, = so don't use him as a regular starter unless he proves himself to be more r= eliable.   Ike Hilliard , WR NYG - Russell Updated 10/23/01 Hilliard contin= ues to improve each week, and could be back in the Giants' starting lineup = within the next few weeks. Hilliard led the G-Men with six catches for 80 y= ards on Monday night against Philadelphia, and looked as though his surgica= lly-repaired foot is almost completely healed.   Ron Dixon , WR NYG - Free = Agent Updated 10/23/! 0!  Dixon missed Monday night's 10-9 loss to the Phil= adelphia Eagles due to a sprained ankle. The reserve wideout is day-to-day.=    Marshall Faulk , RB STL - Matty Updated 10/23/01 According to Head Coach=  Mike Martz, Faulk is questionable for Sunday's game against New Orleans. ""= I'm just taking the same posture that we did a week ago,"" Martz said. ""I wo= uld not expect Marshall to be up (active) for this game. He's got to be 100=  percent before I'll be convinced that we've got to let him play."" Trung Ca= nidate would once again start in Faulk's absence is he's unable to go.    A= nthony Wright , QB DAL - Free Age! nt! Updated 10/23/01 Wright is expected = to start Sunday's game against Arizona despite swelling in his right knee. = Ryan Leaf could see some action in the game, however, so starting Wright fr= om a Fantasy perspective isn't advisable.   Dez White , WR CHI - Free Agent=  Updated 10/23/01 According to the Chicago Sun-Times, White will start in p= lace of the injured Marcus Robinson. White has struggled with his ball-catc= hing abilities, however, so be cautious in picking him up outside of deeper=  leagues.   David Terrell , WR CHI - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 ! Terrell = will not start at wide receiver in place of the injured Marcus Robinson, as=  was reportedly earlier. The Chicago Sun-Times is now reporting that Dez Wh= ite will start in place of Robinson, with Terrell being used as the team's = third receiver.   Tony Martin , WR ATL - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Martin=  will have an X-ray on his broken right collarbone this week. The team feel= s confident that Martin will be available for their Nov. 11 game against Da= llas, so Fantasy owners should keep him on reserve until then.   Rob Moore = , WR ARI - Martin Updated 10/23/01 According to Cardinals coach Dave McGinn= is, Moore may not play a regular season! g! ame this season. Moore, who has=  been dealing with a hamstring injury, continues to have setbacks in his re= covery. ""I was hoping we'd see him by now, McGinnis told the Arizona Republ= ic. ""That's why we both handled it like we did in training camp and we pace= d him. We were planning to have him from the start. I can't tell you when h= e'll be back. Until he can practice for a couple of weeks, we won't have hi= m."" If Moore is still on your Fantasy roster, now is the time to let him go= .   Tiki Barber , RB NYG - Neal/McKay Updated 10/22/01 Barber, who is proba= ble with a hamstring injury, is expected to play Monday night against Phila= delphia. Still, he will not get many carries, as Ron Dayne is expected to g= et the bulk of the work. Barber might be on the verge of losing the startin= g job outright for the remainder of the season.  Richard Huntley , RB CAR -=  Free Agent Updated 10/22/01 Panthers Head Coach George Seifert said Monday=  that Huntley will enter Week Seven as the team's starting tailback. ""He ha= s progressed from the standpoint that he is now healthy,"" said Seifert. ""He= re's a golden opportunity."" See if Huntley is still available in your leagu= e, as he looks to be the first player given a shot to claim the Carolina st= arting RB job.  Jacquez Green , WR TB - Free Agent Updated 10/22/01 Green s= uffered a left hip sprain during Sunday's game against Pittsburgh. The inju= ry will prevent him from practicing much this week, and could keep him out = of next Sunday's game against Minnesota. Monitor Green's progress during th= e week before deciding whether to use him in Week! S! even.  Keyshawn Johns= on , WR TB - Giggles Updated 10/22/01 Johnson was sidelined for the final m= inutes of Sunday's game against Pittsburgh due to a right hip flexor strain= . He will be limited in practice this week and could miss next Sunday's gam= e against Minnesota. Keep an eye on Johnson's progress this week as you pre= pare your lineup for Week Seven.  Warrick Dunn , RB TB - Martin Updated 10/= 22/01 Dunn suffered a strained right hamstring during Sunday's game against=  Pittsburgh. ""I don't know what kind of situation we're going to be in,"" Bu= cs Head Coach Tony Dungy! t! old the St. Petersburg Times . ""Warrick pulled=  a muscle, and he may be out a little while. So I don't know who it'll be c= arrying the load."" Dunn's backup, Aaron Stecker, is also injured, so be car= eful considering starting any Tampa Bay running backs in Week Seven.  Brett=  Favre , QB GB - Frank Updated 10/22/01 Favre injured his right elbow in th= e final seconds of Sunday's game at Minnesota. Fortunately, the Packers hav= e a bye week in Week Seven, so he should have time to recover. ""It'll be OK= ,"" Favre told the Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel. ""Thank goodness I have a week=  to relax. I think that will help.""  James Stewart , RB DET ! -! Hunter Upd= ated 10/22/01 Stewart left Sunday's game against Tennessee in the fourth qu= arter with a sprained right ankle. He is listed as day to day, and Lamont W= arren finished the game in his absence.  More Updates [IMAGE]  Copyright 20= 01 Commissioner.COM Inc and SportsLine.com Inc.

""I wouldn't expect Mar= shall to be up for this game,"" coach Mike Martz said. ""He's got to be 100 p= ercent before I would be convinced that we've got to let him play. And if h= e's not, then he doesn't play."" Canidate proved himself as a worthy replace= ment last Sunday against the Jets, and should be starting from a Fantasy pe= rspective again this week.     J.J. Stokes , WR SF - Free Agent Updated 10/= 23/01 Stokes spent much of the bye week tending to his injured legs, and is=  close to being completely healthy. ""Thankfully the bye week came so early.=  It was a blessing for me because I was ! ab! le to get treatment every day= ,"" Stokes told the Contra Costa Times . ""I practiced today good. I wouldn't=  say I'm 100 percent but I'm darn close."" Stokes has been less than mediocr= e, however, so don't use him as a regular starter unless he proves himself = to be more reliable.   Ike Hilliard , WR NYG - Tori Kuykendall Updated 10/2= 3/01 Hilliard continues to improve each week, and is now back in the Giants= ' starting lineup. Hilliard led the G-Men with six catches for 80 yards on = Monday night against Philadelphia, and looked as though his surgically-repa= ired foot is almost completely healed.   Ron Dixon , WR NYG - Free Agent Up= dated 10/23/01 Dixon missed Monday night's 10-9 loss to the Philadelphia Ea= gles due to a sprained ankle. The reserve wideout is day-to-day.   Marshall=  Faulk , RB STL - McKay Neal Updated 10/23/01 According to Head Coach Mike = Martz, Faulk is questionable for Sunday's game against New Orleans. ""I'm ju= st taking the same posture that we did a week ago,"" Martz said. ""I would no= t expect Marshall to be up (active) for this game. He's got to be 100 perce= nt before I'll be convinced that we've got to let him play."" Trung Canidate=  would once again start in Faulk's absence is he's unable to go.    Anthony=  Wright , QB DAL - Free Agent ! Updated 10/23/01 Wright is expected to star= t Sunday's game against Arizona despite swelling in his right knee. Ryan Le= af could see some action in the game, however, so starting Wright from a Fa= ntasy perspective isn't advisable.   Dez White , WR CHI - Free Agent Update= d 10/23/01 According to the Chicago Sun-Times, White will start in place of=  the injured Marcus Robinson. White has struggled with his ball-catching ab= ilities, however, so be cautious in picking him up outside of deeper league= s.   David Terrell , WR CHI - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Terrel! l ! will = not start at wide receiver in place of the injured Marcus Robinson, as was = reportedly earlier. The Chicago Sun-Times is now reporting that Dez White w= ill start in place of Robinson, with Terrell being used as the team's third=  receiver.   Tony Martin , WR ATL - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Martin will=  have an X-ray on his broken right collarbone this week. The team feels con= fident that Martin will be available for their Nov. 11 game against Dallas,=  so Fantasy owners should keep him on reserve until then.   Rob Moore , WR = ARI - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 According to Cardinals coach Dave McGinni= s, Moore may not play a regular season gam! e ! this season. Moore, who has=  been dealing with a hamstring injury, continues to have setbacks in his re= covery. ""I was hoping we'd see him by now, McGinnis told the Arizona Republ= ic. ""That's why we both handled it like we did in training camp and we pace= d him. We were planning to have him from the start. I can't tell you when h= e'll be back. Until he can practice for a couple of weeks, we won't have hi= m."" If Moore is still on your Fantasy roster, now is the time to let him go= .   Tiki Barber , RB NYG - The Klap Updated 10/22/01 Barber, who is probabl= e with a hamstring injury, is expected to play Monday night against Philade= lphia. Still, he will not get many carries, as Ron Dayne is expected to get=  the bulk of the work. Barber might be on the verge of losing the starting = job outright for the remainder of the season.  Richard Huntley , RB CAR - F= ree Agent Updated 10/22/01 Panthers Head Coach George Seifert said Monday t= hat Huntley will enter Week Seven as the team's starting tailback. ""He has = progressed from the standpoint that he is now healthy,"" said Seifert. ""Here= 's a golden opportunity."" See if Huntley is still available in your league,=  as he looks to be the first player given a shot to claim the Carolina star= ting RB job.  Jacquez Green , WR TB - Hunter Shively Updated 10/22/01 Green=  suffered a left hip sprain during Sunday's game against Pittsburgh. The in= jury will prevent him from practicing much this week, and could keep him ou= t of next Sunday's game against Minnesota. Monitor Green's progress during = the week before deciding whether to use him in Week! S! even.  Keyshawn Joh= nson , WR TB - Top Dogs Updated 10/22/01 Johnson was sidelined for the fina= l minutes of Sunday's game against Pittsburgh due to a right hip flexor str= ain. He will be limited in practice this week and could miss next Sunday's = game against Minnesota. Keep an eye on Johnson's progress this week as you = prepare your lineup for Week Seven.  Warrick Dunn , RB TB - Hunter Shively = Updated 10/22/01 Dunn suffered a strained right hamstring during Sunday's g= ame against Pittsburgh. ""I don't know what kind of situation we're going to=  be in,"" Bucs Head Coach Tony Dung! y ! told the St. Petersburg Times . ""Wa= rrick pulled a muscle, and he may be out a little while. So I don't know wh= o it'll be carrying the load."" Dunn's backup, Aaron Stecker, is also injure= d, so be careful considering starting any Tampa Bay running backs in Week S= even.

Player Updates NFL Reports  [IMAGE]Latest NFL Player News  Ricky Wat= ters , RB SEA - North Blvd Nutwhackers Updated 10/23/01 According to the Ta= coma News Tribune, Seahawks Head Coach Mike Holmgren says that Watters will=  return to the starting lineup as soon as he's healthy, which could be anot= her month or longer. ""We'll cross that bridge when we come to it,"" Holmgren=  said. ""I would be surprised if I didn't insert Ricky back into the lineup.=  He was our best player when he got hurt. Shaun (Alexander) has come in and=  played well. But I would suspect that when Ricky can play, he'll play agai= n."" If you have the roster room, it would be a good idea to stash both back= s on your team to ensure you're safe if Watters takes the job back from Ale= xander dow! n ! the stretch.  Trent Dilfer , QB SEA - Free Agent Updated 10= /23/01 Dilfer was unable to practice on Monday due to a groin injury. He ha= s lost the starting QB job to Matt Hasselbeck, and shouldn't be on any Fant= asy rosters at this point.  Matt Hasselbeck , QB SEA - Free Agent Updated 1= 0/23/01 Hasselbeck will be the Seahawks' starting quarterback for Sunday's = game against Miami, according to the Seattle Post-Intelligencer. He replace= s Trent Dilfer, who stood in for Hasselbeck as he was sidelined with a pull= ed groin. This isn't a very favorable matchup for Hasselbeck fro! m ! a Fan= tasy perspective, so don't use him this week.  Wayne Chrebet , WR NYJ - Who= 's Yo Daddy Updated 10/23/01 The Jets have listed Chrebet as questionable f= or next Sunday's game at Carolina. He will have an MRI on Tuesday to determ= ine the extent of the concussion he suffered Sunday against the Rams.  Dedr= ic Ward , WR MIA - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Ward missed Monday's practic= e due to a foot injury. He is expected to miss Sunday's game at Seattle, an= d isn't a useful Fantasy player at this point in the season.  Lamar Smith ,=  RB MIA - The Lie Downs Updated 10/23/01 Smith did not practice Monday due = to an ankle injury. He is still expected to play Sunday in Seattle, so don'= t be afraid to use him this week.  Marvin Minnis , WR KC - North Blvd Nutwh= ackers Updated 10/23/01 Chiefs Head Coach Dick Vermail said Monday that Min= nis might start ahead of Chris Thomas in Thursday's game against Indianapol= is. We don't recommend you use either receiver despite the fact that the Co= lts' secondary is hardly imposing. Neither player is going to be a clear-cu= t starter this week.  Jerome Pathon , WR IND - The Snake! P! it Updated 10/= 23/01 Pathon might miss his third straight game Thursday at Kansas City due=  to a sprained right foot. Don't use him this week.  Terrence Wilkins , WR = IND - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Wilkins is questionable for Thursday's ga= me at Kansas City due to broken ribs. We don't recommend you use him in a F= antasy league this week.  Terrell Davis , RB DEN - Meximullets Updated 10/2= 3/01 Davis is still targeting Sunday's game against New England as his come= back game from arthroscopic knee surgery, but the Broncos have not decided = whether they will activate! h! im. He will work in practice this week and t= he Broncos hope to know by Wednesday whether Davis can play. We don't recom= mend you use Davis in a Fantasy league unless it's absolutely certain he's = Denver's starting running back and is 100 percent healthy.   Warrick Dunn ,=  RB TB - One Man Show Updated 10/23/01 According to the St. Petersburg Time= s, Dunn doesn't have a hamstring strain, as was originally reported. Dunn w= on't practice until late in the week, however, but he is expected to play o= n Sunday against Minnesota.   Duce Staley , RB PHI - The Fat Bastards Updat= ed 10/23/01 Staley started Monday's game against the N.Y. Giants, but he di= dn't finish it. Staley carried the ball just three times for 22 yards, and = was spelled late in the game by rookie Correll Buckhalter, who gained 34 ya= rds on! 1! 1 carries late in the game. At this point, it's tough to depend = on Staley to post consistent Fantasy numbers, so consider reserving him if = your roster allows for a solid replacement.   Joe Nedney , K TEN - Free Age= nt Updated 10/23/01 Nedney suffered a neck injury in Sunday's game but is e= xpected to play this week.   Erron Kinney , TE TEN - Free Agent Updated 10/= 23/01 Kinney will be listed on the injury report because of a calf injury. = However, he is expected to play in this week's game.   Kevin Dyson , WR TEN=  - Meximullets Updated 10/23/01  Dyson is recovering from a thumb injury bu= t is expected to play in Monday's game against the Steelers. He is expected=  to participate in practice.  Eddie George , RB TEN - Thrill Kill Cult Upda= ted 10/23/01 George suffered a thumb injury in Sunday's game. He is expecte= d to play in this week's game.   Steve McNair , QB TEN - North Blvd Nutwhac= kers Updated 10/23/01 McNair is suffering from a sore ankle as a result of = a play in Sunday's game. However, he is expected to play in this week's gam= e.   Chris Sanders , WR TEN - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 The Tennessean re= ports that Sanders has a disc problem in his back. The reserve receiver is = expected to see a specialist this week. Treatment options consist of rest, = an injection, or surgery. Don't expect Sanders to play anytime soon. Rookie=  Drew Bennett will play in his absence.   Damon Jones , TE JAC - Free Agent=  Updated 10/23/01 Jones is expected to resume practicing on Wednesday. An M= RI on his shoulder showed that his injury would not require surgery.   Fred=  Taylor , RB! J! AC - The Nice Machine Updated 10/23/01 Taylor has been rul= ed out of Sunday's game against Baltimore and his status for next week's ga= me remains uncertain. ""All I know is that, from week to week, they increase=  his exercises and change of direction,"" head coach Tom Coughlin told The F= lorida Times-Union. ""It remains to be seen when Fred will be able to play. = Progress is slow. I'm hoping he responds well this week, then we can make s= ome kind of legitimate guess [about a return date] next week."" Taylor has b= een inactive since severely injuring his groin on Sept 23.     Dennis North= cutt , WR CLE - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Northcutt left Sunday's game be= cause of a concussion. He is expected to play when the Browns return to act= ion next week.   Todd Heap , TE BAL - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Heap did = not play Sunday but head coach Brian Billick told The Baltimore Sun he is o= ptimistic that the rookie will play in this week's game. Heap has been inac= tive for the last four games because of a sprained ankle.   Terry Allen , R= B BAL - The Guzzlers Updated 10/23/01 Allen, who left after the fifth play = of Sunday's game with a sprained ankle, is questionable for this week's gam= e. Jason Brookins will start at running back if Allen is inactive.   Elvis = Grbac , QB BAL - Thrill K! il! l Cult Updated 10/23/01 Coach Brian Billick = expects Grbac to be ready for Sunday's game against Jacksonville, but the q= uarterback wasn't so sure. ""I'm day-to-day. I'm feeling pretty sore in the = chest area,"" Grbac said Monday. ""There could be something going on with the=  cartilage. I haven't picked up a ball or thrown a ball, so we'll just have=  to wait and see."" Randall Cunningham will replace Grbac if he is unable to=  play.     Az-Zahir Hakim , WR STL - Thrill Kill Cult Updated 10/23/01 Haki= m suffered a calf injury during Sunday's blowout win over the New York Jets= . However, he is expected to be available for this weekend's game against N= ew Orleans.   Trung Canidate , RB STL - The Executioners Updated 10/23/01 A= ccording to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, Canidate is expected to start in p= lace of Marshall Faulk this weekend against New Orleans. ""I wouldn't expect=  Marshall to be up for this game,"" coach Mike Martz said. ""He's got to be 1= 00 percent before I would be convinced that we've got to let him play. And = if he's not, then he doesn't play."" Canidate proved himself as a worthy rep= lacement last Sunday against the Jets, and should be starting from a Fantas= y perspective again this week.     J.J. Stokes , WR SF - Who's Yo Daddy Upd= ated 10/23/01 Stokes spent much of the bye week tending to his injured legs= , and is close to being completely healthy. ""Thankfully the bye week came s= o early. It was a blessing for me because ! I ! was able to get treatment e= very day,"" Stokes told the Contra Costa Times . ""I practiced today good. I = wouldn't say I'm 100 percent but I'm darn close."" Stokes has been less than=  mediocre, however, so don't use him as a regular starter unless he proves = himself to be more reliable.   Ike Hilliard , WR NYG - oops, I did it again=  Updated 10/23/01 Hilliard continues to improve each week, and is now back = in the Giants' starting lineup. Hilliard led the G-Men with six catches for=  80 yards on Monday night against Philadelphia, and looked as though his su= rgically-repaired foot is almost completely healed.   Ron Dixon , WR NYG - = Free Agent Updated 10/23/01  Dixon missed Monday night's 10-9 loss to the P= hiladelphia Eagles due to a sprained ankle. The reserve wideout is day-to-d= ay.   Marshall Faulk , RB STL - oops, I did it again Updated 10/23/01 Accor= ding to Head Coach Mike Martz, Faulk is questionable for Sunday's game agai= nst New Orleans. ""I'm just taking the same posture that we did a week ago,""=  Martz said. ""I would not expect Marshall to be up (active) for this game. = He's got to be 100 percent before I'll be convinced that we've got to let h= im play."" Trung Canidate would once again start in Faulk's absence is he's = unable to go.    More Updates [IMAGE]  Copyright 2001 Commissioner.COM Inc = and SportsLine.com Inc.

""We'll cross that bridge when we come to it,""=  Holmgren said. ""I would be surprised if I didn't insert Ricky back into th= e lineup. He was our best player when he got hurt. Shaun (Alexander) has co= me in and played well. But I would suspect that when Ricky can play, he'll = play again."" If you have the roster room, it would be a good idea to stash = both backs on your team to ensure you're safe if Watters takes the job back=  from Alexander down the stret! ch!   Trent Dilfer , QB SEA - Free Agent Up= dated 10/23/01 Dilfer was unable to practice on Monday due to a groin injur= y. He has lost the starting QB job to Matt Hasselbeck, and shouldn't be on = any Fantasy rosters at this point.  Matt Hasselbeck , QB SEA - Bass/Hull Up= dated 10/23/01 Hasselbeck will be the Seahawks' starting quarterback for Su= nday's game against Miami, according to the Seattle Post-Intelligencer. He = replaces Trent Dilfer, who stood in for Hasselbeck as he was sidelined with=  a pulled groin. This isn't a very favorable matchup for Hasselbeck fr! om!=  a Fantasy perspective, so don't use him this week.  Wayne Chrebet , WR NYJ=  - JWillie Updated 10/23/01 The Jets have listed Chrebet as questionable fo= r next Sunday's game at Carolina. He will have an MRI on Tuesday to determi= ne the extent of the concussion he suffered Sunday against the Rams.  Dedri= c Ward , WR MIA - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Ward missed Monday's practice=  due to a foot injury. He is expected to miss Sunday's game at Seattle, and=  isn't a useful Fantasy player at this point in the season.  Lamar Smith , = RB MIA - Neal/McKay Updated 10/23/01 Smith did not practice Monday due to a= n ankle injury. He is still expected to play Sunday in Seattle, so don't be=  afraid to use him this week.  Marvin Minnis , WR KC - Free Agent Updated 1= 0/23/01 Chiefs Head Coach Dick Vermail said Monday that Minnis might start = ahead of Chris Thomas in Thursday's game against Indianapolis. We don't rec= ommend you use either receiver despite the fact that the Colts' secondary i= s hardly imposing. Neither player is going to be a clear-cut starter this w= eek.  Jerome Pathon , WR IND - Tori U! pd! ated 10/23/01 Pathon might miss = his third straight game Thursday at Kansas City due to a sprained right foo= t. Don't use him this week.  Terrence Wilkins , WR IND - Free Agent Updated=  10/23/01 Wilkins is questionable for Thursday's game at Kansas City due to=  broken ribs. We don't recommend you use him in a Fantasy league this week.=   Terrell Davis , RB DEN - JWillie Updated 10/23/01 Davis is still targetin= g Sunday's game against New England as his comeback game from arthroscopic = knee surgery, but the Broncos have not decided whether they will activate h= ! im! . He will work in practice this week and the Broncos hope to know by = Wednesday whether Davis can play. We don't recommend you use Davis in a Fan= tasy league unless it's absolutely certain he's Denver's starting running b= ack and is 100 percent healthy.   Warrick Dunn , RB TB - Martin Updated 10/= 23/01 According to the St. Petersburg Times, Dunn doesn't have a hamstring = strain, as was originally reported. Dunn won't practice until late in the w= eek, however, but he is expected to play on Sunday against Minnesota.   Duc= e Staley , RB PHI - Giggles Updated 10/23/01 Staley started Monday's game a= gainst the N.Y. Giants, but he didn't finish it. Staley carried the ball ju= st three times for 22 yards, and was spelled late in the game by rookie Cor= rell Buckhalter, who gained 34 yards on 11 carries l! at! e in the game. At=  this point, it's tough to depend on Staley to post consistent Fantasy numb= ers, so consider reserving him if your roster allows for a solid replacemen= t.   Joe Nedney , K TEN - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Nedney suffered a nec= k injury in Sunday's game but is expected to play this week.   Erron Kinney=  , TE TEN - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Kinney will be listed on the injury=  report because of a calf injury. However, he is expected to play in this w= eek's game.   Kevin Dyson , WR TEN - Bass/Hull Updated 10/23/01  Dyson is r= ecovering from a thumb injury but is expected to play in Monday's game agai= nst the Steelers. He is expected to participate in practice.  Eddie George = , RB TEN - Tori Updated 10/23/01 George suffered a thumb injury in Sunday's=  game. He is expected to play in this week's game.   Steve McNair , QB TEN = - Martin Updated 10/23/01 McNair is suffering from a sore ankle as a result=  of a play in Sunday's game. However, he is expected to play in this week's=  game.   Chris Sanders  , WR TEN - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 The Tennesse= an reports that Sanders has a disc problem in his back. The reserve receive= r is expected to see a specialist this week. Treatment options consist of r= est, an injection, or surgery. Don't expect Sanders to play anytime soon. R= ookie Drew Bennett will play in his absence.   Damon Jones , TE JAC - Free = Agent Updated 10/23/01 Jones is expected to resume practicing on Wednesday.=  An MRI on his shoulder showed that his injury would not require surgery.  =  Fred Taylor , RB JAC - Martin Updated 10/23/01 Taylor has been ruled out o= f Sunday's game against Baltimore and his status for next week's game remai= ns uncertain. ""All I know is that, from week to week, they increase his exe= rcises and change of direction,"" head coach Tom Coughlin told The Florida T= imes-Union. ""It remains to be seen when Fred will be able to play. Progress=  is slow. I'm hoping he responds well this week, then we can make some kind=  of legitimate guess [about a return date] next week."" Taylor has been inac= tive since severely injuring his groin on Sept 23.     Dennis Northcutt , W= R CLE - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Northcutt left Sunday's game because of=  a concussion. He is expected to play when the Browns return to action next=  week.   Todd Heap , TE BAL - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Heap did not play=  Sunday but head coach Brian Billick told The Baltimore Sun he is optimisti= c that the rookie will play in this week's game. Heap has been inactive for=  the last four games because of a sprained ankle.   Terry Allen , RB BAL - = Tori Updated 10/23/01 Allen, who left after the fifth play of Sunday's game=  with a sprained ankle, is questionable for this week's game. Jason Brookin= s will start at running back if Allen is inactive.   Elvis Grbac , QB BAL -=  Tori Updated 10/23/01 Coach Brian Billick expects Grbac to be ready for Su= nday's game against Jacksonville, but the quarterback wasn't so sure. ""I'm = day-to-day. I'm feeling pretty sore in the chest area,"" Grbac said Monday. = ""There could be something going on with the cartilage. I haven't picked up = a ball or thrown a ball, so we'll just have to wait and see."" Randall Cunni= ngham will replace Grbac if he is unable to play.     Az-Zahir Hakim , WR S= TL - Neal/McKay Updated 10/23/01 Hakim suffered a calf injury during Sunday= 's blowout win over the New York Jets. However, he is expected to be availa= ble for this weekend's game against New Orleans.   Trung Canidate , RB STL = - Giggles Updated 10/23/01 According to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, Canida= te is expected to start in place of Marshall Faulk this weekend against New=  Orleans. ""I wouldn't expect Marshall to be up for this game,"" coach Mike M= artz said. ""He's got to be 100 percent before I would be convinced that we'= ve got to let him play. And if he's not, then he doesn't play."" Canidate pr= oved himself as a worthy replacement last Sunday against the Jets, and shou= ld be starting from a Fantasy perspective again this week.     J.J. Stokes = , WR SF - Matty Updated 10/23/01 Stokes spent much of the bye week tending = to his injured legs, and is close to being completely healthy. ""Thankfully = the bye week came so early. It was a blessing for me because I was ab! le! = to get treatment every day,"" Stokes told the Contra Costa Times . ""I practi= ced today good. I wouldn't say I'm 100 percent but I'm darn close."" Stokes = has been less than mediocre, however, so don't use him as a regular starter=  unless he proves himself to be more reliable.   Ike Hilliard , WR NYG - Ru= ssell Updated 10/23/01 Hilliard continues to improve each week, and is now = back in the Giants' starting lineup. Hilliard led the G-Men with six catche= s for 80 yards on Monday night against Philadelphia, and looked as though h= is surgically-repaired foot is almost completely healed.   Ron Dixon , WR N= YG - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Dixon missed Monday night's 10-9 loss to t= he Philadelphia Eagles due to a sprained ankle. The reserve wideout is day-= to-day.   Marshall Faulk , RB STL - Matty Updated 10/23/01 According to Hea= d Coach Mike Martz, Faulk is questionable for Sunday's game against New Orl= eans. ""I'm just taking the same posture that we did a week ago,"" Martz said= . ""I would not expect Marshall to be up (active) for this game. He's got to=  be 100 percent before I'll be convinced that we've got to let him play."" T= rung Canidate would once again start in Faulk's absence is he's unable to g= o.

" Lenny! jumping in the conversation without missing a beat....good to have you with us. Nice comedy....but the only fat, bald 30 year old is the Dogger. (just kidding dog, you's not fat....you's just fluffy). Don is bald, but not fat. Roby is balding, but just a little ""stocky"". Clint has a belly, but is not balding. Other than that, we are all pretty normal (please use that term loosely).  Your parents would love to have us at their crib. Dog could rummage through all of your belongings, eat all of your parents' food, and wake them up at the ass crack of dawn with scrambled eggs and jumby. Roby could show your mom ""a good time"". Porteous, Clay, and Myers could talk to your dad about his company's legal shortcomings. Bernie could sell you all some much needed life insurance. Clint could smoke, and Dehart could clear his lungs so that he could ski without falling dead on the slopes. Gooch could lend Don the money to build an addition to your maw's bathroom (so that Dog and Roby could smell it up). And Naquin could try to get with your sister, take notes of the whole weekend's proceedings, and make copies for all of us to remember them by.  Porthole....see if Timmy, Tricia, Mike Thomas, etc. would be interested in going on the trip...Lenny....see about all of your Houston Fiji buddies (house bitch, Tim, Val, etc.). Tell Tim we'll let him bring his new wife with him, too, although that might mean that there could be up to 3 Phi Mu's on the trip....quorum could be met, and ""the Phi Mu Crew"" might be in full effect; God help us.  Clint, what about Freret and Dawn (that might make 4 Mu's)?  Anyone else we can think of who might be interested in this trip (Jan 10 - 14th)?   Ross F.

""We'll cross that bridge when we come to it,"" Holmgren said. = ""I would be surprised if I didn't insert Ricky back into the l! in! eup. He=  was our best player when he got hurt.

Trent Dilfer, QB SEA - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01Dil= fer was unable to practice on Monday due to a groin injury.

Staley carried the ball just three = times for 22 yards, and was spelled late in the game by rookie Correll Buck= halter, who gained 34 yards on! 1! 1 carries late in the game.

J! AC - The Nice Machine Updated 10/23/01Taylor has been ruled out o= f Sunday's game against Baltimore and his status for next week's game remai= ns uncertain. ""All I know is that, from week to week, they increase his exe= rcises and change of direction,"" head coach Tom Coughlin told The Florida T= imes-Union. ""It remains to be seen when Fred will be able to play. Progress=  is slow. I'm hoping he responds well this week, then we can make some kind=  of legitimate guess [about a return date] next week.""

Other than that, we are all pretty normal (please use that term loosely).  Your parents would love to have us at their crib. Dog could rummage through all of your belongings, eat all of your parents' food, and wake them up at the ass crack of dawn with scrambled eggs and jumby. Roby could show your mom ""a good time"". Porteous, Clay, and Myers could talk to your dad about his company's legal shortcomings. Bernie could sell you all some much needed life insurance. Clint could smoke, and Dehart could clear his lungs so that he could ski without falling dead on the slopes. Gooch could lend Don the money to build an addition to your maw's bathroom (so that Dog and Roby could smell it up). And Naquin could try to get with your sister, take notes of the whole weekend's proceedings, and make copies for all of us to remember them by.  Porthole....see if Timmy, Tricia, Mike Thomas, etc. would be interested in going on the trip...Lenny....see about all of your Houston Fiji buddies (house bitch, Tim, Val, etc.). Tell Tim we'll let him bring his new wife with him, too, although that might mean that there could be up to 3 Phi Mu's on the trip....quorum could be met, and ""the Phi Mu Crew"" might be in full effect; God help us.

He has now been playing football for 40 straight weeks and has one ca= tch for 19 yards in the NFL.      Chris Sanders  , WR TEN - Free Agent Upda= ted 10/24/01   Sanders will not require surgery on his back. He will be re-= evaluated after receiving an injection. His return date is unclear.    Bert=  Emanuel  , WR NE - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01   Emanuel signed with the D= etroit Lions on Wednesday. While the Lions are looking for a receiver to he= lp fill the void created by a season-ending injury to Germane Crowell, Eman= uel won't get the first crack at the job. Don't bother picking him up.    H= ines Ward  , WR PIT - Tori Updated 10/24/01   Ward is day to day with an an= kle injury. He is listed as probable for Monday's game against Tennessee.  =   Germane Crowell  , WR DET - Giggles Updated 10/24/01   The Detroit Lions = placed Crowell on injured reserve on Tuesday with a torn patella tendon in = his left knee, which ends his season.    Santana Moss  , WR NYJ - Free Agen= t Updated 10/24/01   The New York Daily News says there is still a noticeab= le hitch in Moss' stride as he rceovers from knee surgery. The earliest the=  Jets expect him to return is Dec. 2.    Brett Favre  , QB GB - Frank Updat= ed 10/24/01   Favre skipped Tuesday's practice due to general soreness. Wit= h Green Bay on the bye this week, expect him to be fully recovered in time = for Week Eight.    Marvin Minnis  , WR KC - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01   E= arly indications this week were Minnis would return to the starting lineup.=  But the Kansas City Star notes Chris Thomas is still working with the firs= t team in practice. There is no official word on which player will start on=  Thursday against the Colts.    Larry Foster  , WR DET - Free Agent Updated=  10/24/01   According to the Detroit Free Press , Foster is expected to sta= rt in Germane Crowell's place Sunday against Cincinnati. Foster is an inexp= erienced wideout not worthy of picking up in Fantasy leagues right now. Mon= itor his progress over the next few weeks.    Marcus Robinson  , WR CHI - H= unter Updated 10/24/01   The Bears placed Robinson on injured reserve on Tu= esday with torn ligaments in his left knee, effectively ending his season. = Drop him unless you play in a keeper league.    Neil Rackers  , K CIN - Fre= e Agent Updated 10/24/01   According to the Cincinnati Enquirer , the Benga= ls worked out three kickers, and did not sign one. Rackers' job is temporar= ily safe, but he is a big Fantasy risk because of his erratic play.    Todd=  Pinkston  , WR PHI - Hunter Updated 10/24/01   Pinkston has a strained wri= st but is expected to play in Sunday's game. He will be evaluated on a day = to day basis.     Ron Dixon  , WR NYG - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01   Dixon=  missed Monday game because of a sprained ankle. He has made progress in hi= s recovery and might play this week.    Joe Jurevicius  , WR NYG - Free Age= nt Updated 10/24/01   Ike Hilliard regained his starting position Monday, r= eturning Jurevicius to the role of a reserve. Jurevicius was productive as = a starter in Hilliard's absence. However, he will be useless as the No. 3 r= eceiver. There is a chance that he could return to starting lineup and repl= ace Amani Toomer. Toomer has been inconsistent this season. Jurevicius play= ed alongside Hilliard a few times in Sunday's game while Toomer stood on th= e sidelines.     Reggie Swinton  , WR DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01   S= winton is suffering from a hamstring injury and is questionable for Sunday'= s game against Arizona. ""He [Swinton] worked with the trainers on Monday an= d did some things, but he didn't do enough to say for sure he will be avail= able,"" said head coach Dave Campo. Darrin Chiaverini and Raghib Ismail will=  get more playing time in his absence.     Joey Galloway  , WR DAL - Giggle= s Updated 10/24/01   Galloway is listed as questionable for this week's gam= e against the Cardinals, but the Cowboys are optimistic about his chances o= f playing. He is recovering from a sprained foot. ""We're expecting some lim= ited practice tomorrow, so I would say he is questionable from the standpoi= nt that it will depend on how he improves the next two or three days,"" said=  head coach Dave Campo.       Darrin Chiaverini  , WR DAL - Free Agent Upda= ted 10/24/01   Chiaverini practiced Monday and is listed as probable for Su= nday's game against the Cardinals. He is recovering from a left knee injury= .     Raghib Ismail  , WR DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01   Ismail, recov= ering from a sprained knee, practiced Monday without any problems. He is li= sted as probable for this week's game.     Ricky Watters  , RB SEA - Free A= gent Updated 10/23/01   According to the Tacoma News Tribune , Seahawks Hea= d Coach Mike Holmgren says that Watters will return to the starting lineup = as soon as he's healthy, which could be another month or longer. ""We'll cro= ss that bridge when we come to it,"" Holmgren said. ""I would be surprised if=  I didn't insert Ricky back into the lineup. He was our best player when he=  got hurt. Shaun (Alexander) has come in and played well. But I would suspe= ct that when Ricky can play, he'll play again."" If you have the roster room= , it would be a good idea to stash both backs on your team to ensure you're=  safe if Watters takes the job back from Alexander down the stretch.    Tre= nt Dilfer  , QB SEA - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01   Dilfer was unable to pr= actice on Monday due to a groin injury. He has lost the starting QB job to = Matt Hasselbeck, and shouldn't be on any Fantasy rosters at this point.    = Matt Hasselbeck  , QB SEA - Bass/Hull Updated 10/23/01   Hasselbeck will be=  the Seahawks' starting quarterback for Sunday's game against Miami, accord= ing to the Seattle Post-Intelligencer . He replaces Trent Dilfer, who stood=  in for Hasselbeck as he was sidelined with a pulled groin. This isn't a ve= ry favorable matchup for Hasselbeck from a Fantasy perspective, so don't us= e him this week.    Wayne Chrebet  , WR NYJ - JWillie Updated 10/23/01   Th= e Jets have listed Chrebet as questionable for next Sunday's game at Caroli= na. He will have an MRI on Tuesday to determine the extent of the concussio= n he suffered Sunday against the Rams.    Dedric Ward  , WR MIA - Free Agen= t Updated 10/23/01   Ward missed Monday's practice due to a foot injury. He=  is expected to miss Sunday's game at Seattle, and isn't a useful Fantasy p= layer at this point in the season.    Lamar Smith  , RB MIA - Neal/McKay Up= dated 10/23/01   Smith did not practice Monday due to an ankle injury. He i= s still expected to play Sunday in Seattle, so don't be afraid to use him t= his week.    Marvin Minnis  , WR KC - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01   Chiefs = Head Coach Dick Vermail said Monday that Minnis might start ahead of Chris = Thomas in Thursday's game against Indianapolis. We don't recommend you use = either receiver despite the fact that the Colts' secondary is hardly imposi= ng. Neither player is going to be a clear-cut starter this week.    Jerome = Pathon  , WR IND - Tori Updated 10/23/01   Pathon might miss his third stra= ight game Thursday at Kansas City due to a sprained right foot. Don't use h= im this week.    Terrence Wilkins  , WR IND - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01  =  Wilkins is questionable for Thursday's game at Kansas City due to broken r= ibs. We don't recommend you use him in a Fantasy league this week.    Terre= ll Davis  , RB DEN - JWillie Updated 10/23/01   Davis is still targeting Su= nday's game against New England as his comeback game from arthroscopic knee=  surgery, but the Broncos have not decided whether they will activate him. = He will work in practice this week and the Broncos hope to know by Wednesda= y whether Davis can play. We don't recommend you use Davis in a Fantasy lea= gue unless it's absolutely certain he's Denver's starting running back and = is 100 percent healthy.    More Updates    Player News Teams   [IMAGE]   Ma= tty Player News    Marshall Faulk  , Active RB Updated 10/23/01  According = to Head Coach Mike Martz, Faulk is questionable for Sunday's game against N= ew Orleans. ""I'm just taking the same posture that we did a week ago,"" Mart= z said. ""I would not expect Marshall to be up (active) for this game. He's = got to be 100 percent before I'll be convinced that we've got to let him pl= ay."" Trung Canidate would once again start in Faulk's absence is he's unabl= e to go.    J.J. Stokes  , Reserve WR Updated 10/23/01  Stokes spent much o= f the bye week tending to his injured legs, and is close to being completel= y healthy. ""Thankfully the bye week came so early. It was a blessing for me=  because I was able to get treatment every day,"" Stokes told the Contra Cos= ta Times . ""I practiced today good. I wouldn't say I'm 100 percent but I'm = darn close."" Stokes has been less than mediocre, however, so don't use him = as a regular starter unless he proves himself to be more reliable.    Brian=  Griese  , Reserve QB Updated 10/21/01  Griese (shoulder) started Sunday's = game against San Diego, but he was ineffective. He posted 212 yards passing= , a touchdown and two interceptions in Denver's 27-10 loss.    Terry Glenn =  , Active WR Updated 10/21/01  According to published reports, Glenn has be= en declared inactive for Sunday's game against Indianapolis. Glenn is deali= ng with a hamstring injury that he sustained last week, and he is not yet 1= 00 percent.    Michael Pittman  , Active RB Updated 10/21/01  Pittman had a=  great outing on Sunday against Kansas City, posting 137 yards of total off= ense and a touchdown. Pittman won't post numbers this good with any regular= ity, but he's still a valuable player to have on your roster.    Frank Wych= eck  , Reserve TE Updated 10/21/01  Wycheck caught seven passes for 100 yar= ds and a TD at Detroit. Despite some quiet outings until this week, he rema= ins a top-notch Fantasy TE, especially with the Titans lacking in talent at=  wide receiver.    Michael Bennett  , Reserve RB Updated 10/21/01  Bennett = has now been listed as inactive for Sunday's game against Green Bay. Doug C= hapman will start at tailback for the Vikings in his absence.    Rod Smith =  , Active WR Updated 10/19/01  Smith should have another fine game this wee= k. He will be the focal point of the Denver passing game in a contest that = will feature a lot of offense.    Aaron Brooks  , Active QB Updated 10/18/0= 1  This could be the week that Brooks breaks out of his semi-slump. Brooks = will be facing an Atlanta defense that is dead last in the league against t= he pass, so the matchup is certainly in his favor.    Joe Horn  , Active WR=  Updated 10/18/01  Horn is a must-start this weekend against Atlanta. The F= alcons' secondary is very vulnerable, so Horn should have no trouble puttin= g up solid Fantasy numbers.    Giants  , Active DT Updated 10/17/01  Defens= ive tackle Keith Hamilton suffered a separated shoulder during Sunday's gam= e against St. Louis, but he is expected to play on Monday night against Phi= ladelphia. Linebacker Mike Barrow has a hip pointer, but should be able to = play in the game as well with some extra padding. CB Will Allen has a sprai= ned ankle, and his status against the Eagles is questionable at this point.=     Brad Johnson  , Reserve QB Updated 10/14/01  Johnson finally had a prod= uctive game Fantasy-wise, throwing for 287 yards and three scores against T= ennessee. He is still not worth starting on a regular basis, however, and i= s better off used when the matchup is good.    Oronde Gadsden  , Reserve WR=  Updated 10/12/01  Gadsden should find himself in position to catch a TD pa= ss against the Jets. Miami will score often against the New York defense.  =   Sebastian Janikowski  , Active K Updated 10/10/01  Janikowki needed five = stitches to close a cut on his head that was suffered during an off-field i= ncident. He has not missed practice and should play against the Colts this = week.   [IMAGE]  Copyright 2001 Commissioner.COM Inc and SportsLine.com Inc= .

""He's not going to be really ready to do any work that would be = football related until next summer,"" coach George Seifert said Wednesday.

Richard Huntley, who will replace Biakabutuka in the starting = lineup, visited his teammate at the hospital Tuesday. Huntley said the inju= ry was far worse than he expected and he's concerned Biakabutuka won't play=  again.        James Stewart  , RB DET - Tori Kuykendall Updated 10/25/01  =  Stewart will probably play on Sunday against the Bengals. The Detroit Free=  Press reports that his ankle injury has now been identified as a bad bruis= e and not a sprain.     Wayne Chrebet  , WR NYJ - Fear Updated 10/25/01   C= hrebet, the New York Jets' top receiver, will miss Sunday's game at Carolin= a with a head injury. He was hit in the helmet by St. Louis Rams' defensive=  tackle Brian Young on Sunday and left the game complaining of dizziness. I= t was the second consecutive week that a head injury knocked Chrebet out of=  the game. He left the Jets' win over Miami in the second half on Oct. 14. = Coach Herman Edwards described Chrebet's ailment as ""post-trauma migraines""=  and said he wanted to be extra cautious with the injury.  Edwards said Chr= ebet passed the various tests and scans he was given. Laveranues Coles will=  be the top receiver in his absence. Rookie Kevin Swayne will move ino the = starting lineup.       Terrell Davis  , RB DEN - Eric Bass Updated 10/25/01=    Davis disputed rumors that he may have a stress fracture in his leg and = could be lost for the season. ""At this point in time, I'm on schedule to pl= ay this Sunday,"" Davis said. Davis, who has missed five games this year and=  29 since 1999, admitted that his right knee remains sore, but he has been = well enough to play on the scout team the past two weeks. He remained on th= e scout team Wednesday as the Broncos prepared for this week's game against=  the New England Patriots. Davis was listed as questionable on the weekly i= njury report. Don't bother to start him. His abilities will be limited if h= e does play Sunday.        Clint Stoerner  , QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 10= /25/01   Starting quarterback Anthony Wright didn't practice Wednesday beca= use of fluid on his right knee, and might not play Sunday. Head coach Dave = Campo said Stoerner would start ahead of Ryan Leaf, if Wright isn't ready t= o play. Using Stoerner in your starting lineup would be a risky move. Stoer= ner, a second-year player from Arkansas, has never started in the NFL. He h= as played in only three games, completing 4 of 7 passes for 44 yards and tw= o touchdowns in his two appearances this season.       Anthony Wright  , QB=  DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01   Wright didn't practice Wednesday becau= se of fluid on his right knee, and coach Dave Campo indicated Wright might = not play Sunday.   Wright expected to have results of an MRI exam Thursday,=  and Campo said he wouldn't make a final decision on the quarterback's play= ing status for the Arizona game until after that. Campo said Clint Stoerner=  would start ahead of Ryan Leaf if Wright isn't ready to play Sunday. Campo=  said there was a good chance that Leaf could play for the Cowboys on Sunda= y. Leaf apparently hasn't been with the team long enough to merit a startin= g spot yet.        Terrell Davis  , RB DEN - Eric Bass Updated 10/24/01   D= avis is sufficiently healed from a knee injury, but now his lower left leg = is giving him problems and will probably keep him out of action this week. = X-rays revealed no stress fracture, says the Denver Post , but Davis' leg i= s throbbing. Mike Anderson will retain the starting job for now. If Davis i= s able to play, which seems unlikely, he will be very limited.    Amani Too= mer  , WR NYG - McKay Neal Updated 10/24/01   According to published report= s, Toomer might be benched in favor of WR Joe Jurevicius. Ike Hilliard will=  join Jurevicius if Toomer is demoted. Toomer caught only three passes Mond= ay night against the Eagles and did not have a reception for more than 10 y= ards. Head coach Jim Fassel demoted Toomer last season, in an effort to mot= ivate him.     Wayne Chrebet  , WR NYJ - Fear Updated 10/24/01   Chrebet wi= ll miss Sunday's game at Carolina with a head injury. Coach Herman Edwards = described Chrebet's ailment as ""post-trauma migraines"" and said he wanted t= o be extra cautious with the injury.   Edwards said Chrebet passed the vari= ous tests and scans he was given. Chrebet will be replaced by Kevin Swayne,=  a 26-year-old rookie who played in both the Arena League and the XFL durin= g the past year.

Chris Sanders  , WR TEN - Free=  Agent Updated 10/24/01   Sanders will not require surgery on his back. He = will be re-evaluated after receiving an injection. His return date is uncle= ar.    Bert Emanuel  , WR NE - McKay Neal Updated 10/24/01   Emanuel signed=  with the Detroit Lions on Wednesday. While the Lions are looking for a rec= eiver to help fill the void created by a season-ending injury to Germane Cr= owell, Emanuel won't get the first crack at the job. Don't bother picking h= im up.    Hines Ward  , WR PIT - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01   Ward is day = to day with an ankle injury. He is listed as probable for Monday's game aga= inst Tennessee.    Germane Crowell  , WR DET - FIBSABs Updated 10/24/01   T= he Detroit Lions placed Crowell on injured reserve on Tuesday with a torn p= atella tendon in his left knee, which ends his season.    Santana Moss  , W= R NYJ - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01   The New York Daily News says there is=  still a noticeable hitch in Moss' stride as he rceovers from knee surgery.=  The earliest the Jets expect him to return is Dec. 2.    Brett Favre  , QB=  GB - The Klap Updated 10/24/01   Favre skipped Tuesday's practice due to g= eneral soreness. With Green Bay on the bye this week, expect him to be full= y recovered in time for Week Eight.    Marvin Minnis  , WR KC - Free Agent = Updated 10/24/01   Early indications this week were Minnis would return to = the starting lineup. But the Kansas City Star notes Chris Thomas is still w= orking with the first team in practice. There is no official word on which = player will start on Thursday against the Colts.    Larry Foster  , WR DET = - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01   According to the Detroit Free Press , Foste= r is expected to start in Germane Crowell's place Sunday against Cincinnati= . Foster is an inexperienced wideout not worthy of picking up in Fantasy le= agues right now. Monitor his progress over the next few weeks.    Marcus Ro= binson  , WR CHI - Eric Bass Updated 10/24/01   The Bears placed Robinson o= n injured reserve on Tuesday with torn ligaments in his left knee, effectiv= ely ending his season. Drop him unless you play in a keeper league.    Neil=  Rackers  , K CIN - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01   According to the Cincinna= ti Enquirer , the Bengals worked out three kickers, and did not sign one. R= ackers' job is temporarily safe, but he is a big Fantasy risk because of hi= s erratic play.    Todd Pinkston  , WR PHI - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01   = Pinkston has a strained wrist but is expected to play in Sunday's game. He = will be evaluated on a day to day basis.     Ron Dixon  , WR NYG - Free Age= nt Updated 10/24/01   Dixon missed Monday game because of a sprained ankle.=  He has made progress in his recovery and might play this week.    Joe Jure= vicius  , WR NYG - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01   Ike Hilliard regained his = starting position Monday, returning Jurevicius to the role of a reserve. Ju= revicius was productive as a starter in Hilliard's absence. However, he wil= l be useless as the No. 3 receiver. There is a chance that he could return = to starting lineup and replace Amani Toomer. Toomer has been inconsistent t= his season. Jurevicius played alongside Hilliard a few times in Sunday's ga= me while Toomer stood on the sidelines.     Reggie Swinton  , WR DAL - Free=  Agent Updated 10/24/01   Swinton is suffering from a hamstring injury and = is questionable for Sunday's game against Arizona. ""He [Swinton] worked wit= h the trainers on Monday and did some things, but he didn't do enough to sa= y for sure he will be available,"" said head coach Dave Campo. Darrin Chiave= rini and Raghib Ismail will get more playing time in his absence.     Joey = Galloway  , WR DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01   Galloway is listed as qu= estionable for this week's game against the Cardinals, but the Cowboys are = optimistic about his chances of playing. He is recovering from a sprained f= oot. ""We're expecting some limited practice tomorrow, so I would say he is = questionable from the standpoint that it will depend on how he improves the=  next two or three days,"" said head coach Dave Campo.       Darrin Chiaveri= ni  , WR DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01   Chiaverini practiced Monday an= d is listed as probable for Sunday's game against the Cardinals. He is reco= vering from a left knee injury.     Raghib Ismail  , WR DAL - Rocks Updated=  10/24/01   Ismail, recovering from a sprained knee, practiced Monday witho= ut any problems. He is listed as probable for this week's game.     Ricky W= atters  , RB SEA - Rocks Updated 10/23/01   According to the Tacoma News Tr= ibune , Seahawks Head Coach Mike Holmgren says that Watters will return to = the starting lineup as soon as he's healthy, which could be another month o= r longer. ""We'll cross that bridge when we come to it,"" Holmgren said. ""I w= ould be surprised if I didn't insert Ricky back into the lineup. He was our=  best player when he got hurt. Shaun (Alexander) has come in and played wel= l. But I would suspect that when Ricky can play, he'll play again."" If you = have the roster room, it would be a good idea to stash both backs on your t= eam to ensure you're safe if Watters takes the job back from Alexander down=  the stretch.    Trent Dilfer  , QB SEA - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01   Dil= fer was unable to practice on Monday due to a groin injury. He has lost the=  starting QB job to Matt Hasselbeck, and shouldn't be on any Fantasy roster= s at this point.    Matt Hasselbeck  , QB SEA - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01=    Hasselbeck will be the Seahawks' starting quarterback for Sunday's game = against Miami, according to the Seattle Post-Intelligencer . He replaces Tr= ent Dilfer, who stood in for Hasselbeck as he was sidelined with a pulled g= roin. This isn't a very favorable matchup for Hasselbeck from a Fantasy per= spective, so don't use him this week.    Wayne Chrebet  , WR NYJ - Fear Upd= ated 10/23/01   The Jets have listed Chrebet as questionable for next Sunda= y's game at Carolina. He will have an MRI on Tuesday to determine the exten= t of the concussion he suffered Sunday against the Rams.    More Updates   =  Player News Teams   [IMAGE]   Matt Lenhart Player News    Isaac Bruce  , A= ctive WR Updated 10/22/01  Bruce was held to two catches for 37 yards Sunda= y, but that wasn't necessarily a reflection on him. The Rams were able to r= un the ball successfully so they didn't pass as much as they normally do. L= ook for Bruce to do better next week against the Saints.    Tony Banks  , R= eserve QB Updated 10/21/01  Banks finally had a somewhat productive game on=  Sunday, throwing for 346 yards and a score against Carolina. His performan= ce doesn't make him any more valuable from a Fantasy perspective, however, = so don't consider him any better than a reserve.    Corey Dillon  , Active = RB Updated 10/21/01  The Bears held Dillon to just 30 yards on 16 carries. = Expect the veteran runner to bounce back from such a quiet performance very=  quickly.    Johnnie Morton  , Reserve WR Updated 10/19/01  Morton could ha= ve a big game this weekend against Tennessee. The Titans' secondary has bee= n shaky at best, so the positive matchup makes Morton a good start from a F= antasy perspective.    Cris Carter  , Active WR Updated 10/19/01  Expect go= od numbers from Carter this week. He is a big-game player who will not be f= lustered by the improved Green Bay defense.    Kerry Collins  , Reserve QB = Updated 10/18/01  Collins has been mediocre at best this season, but his nu= mbers against Philadelphia were respectable in 2000. He's not the best opti= on Fantasy-wise, but you could do worse if you're desperate for a quarterba= ck.    Eric Moulds  , Active WR Updated 10/18/01  Moulds might get in the e= nd zone against Jacksonville. Look for the Bills to move him around often a= gainst the injury-riddled Jaguars secondary.    Peerless Price  , Reserve W= R Updated 10/18/01  Price might post respectable numbers against the Jaguar= s. Jacksonville's secondary is thin because of injuries.    Stephen Davis  = , Active RB Updated 10/18/01  Davis had his first decent game of the season=  on Monday against Dallas, but he's still a very risky Fantasy player due t= o Washington's horrible offense. Facing Carolina is an advantageous matchup= , however, so starting Davis this week warrants consideration.    Rickey Du= dley  , Reserve TE Updated 10/09/01  The Browns have placed Dudley on injur= ed reserve with a foot injury, officially ending his season. Drop him if he=  was on your Fantasy roster.    Steve Beuerlein  , Active QB Updated 10/05/= 01  The Broncos placed Beuerlein on injured reserve on Friday, ending his s= eason. He has been healing slowly from an offseason elbow injury, and isn't=  worth holding on to if you had him as insurance to Brian Griese in your le= ague.    Dolphins  , Active DT Updated 10/02/01  Linebacker Zach Thomas suf= fered a partially torn medial collateral ligament in his left knee during S= unday's loss to St. Louis. ""It's just real sore,"" Thomas told the Miami Her= ald . ""I'm going to try to play [Sunday].""

He did some running=  but did not practice Wednesday. Glenn is still recovering from a hamstring=  injury and the Patriots want to see how his leg holds up before activating=  him Sunday.     Drew Bledsoe  , QB NE - The Executioners Updated 10/25/01 =   The Boston Globe reports that there is a possibility that Bledsoe might b= e able to fill in as the emergency QB Sunday. Although he is still under hi= s playing weight, he has begun throwing and doing individual passing drills= .     Chad Morton  , RB NYJ - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01   Morton might be=  able to play this Sunday, according to The Bergen Record . He has missed t= he past three games because of an ankle sprain.     Marco Battaglia  , TE C= IN - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01   Battaglia is listed on the injury report=  as probable. He has a calf injury but is expected to play in Sunday's game=  at Detroit.     Chad Johnson  , WR CIN - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01   Joh= nson is making progress in his recovery from a broken clavicle, but The Cin= cinnati Enquirer reports that he will be sidelined for several more weeks. = Ron Dugans will fill in as the third receiver in his absence.     Chris San= ders  , WR TEN - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01   Sanders has responded well t= o back treatment and might play Monday, according to The Nashville Tennesse= an . However, Sanders is used as a third receiver on a run-oriented team an= d won't be too productive even if he is healthy.     Tyrone Wheatley  , RB = OAK - One Man Show Updated 10/25/01   Wheatley did not practice Wednesday b= ecause of a wrist and knee injuries, but head coach Jon Gruden told The Con= tra Costa Times that he is making progress. He is listed as questionable fo= r Sunday's game against the Eagles.     Keyshawn Johnson  , WR TB - The Lie=  Downs Updated 10/25/01   Johnson ran in the morning and afternoon but did = not practice Wednesday, according to The St. Petersburg Times . Johnson is = recovering from hip and thigh injuries but is expected to play Sunday.     = Jacquez Green  , WR TB - The Guzzlers Updated 10/25/01   Green is listed as=  questionable for Sunday's game against Minnesota. He is recovering from a = groin strain. Frank Murphy will replace Green at receiver if he is unable t= o play.     Warrick Dunn  , RB TB - One Man Show Updated 10/25/01   Dunn pa= rticipated in running drills Wednesday and did not have any setbacks in his=  recovery from a toe injury, according to The St. Petersburg Times . Nevert= heless, Dunn is still listed as questionable for this week's game against M= innesota.     Ike Hilliard  , WR NYG - oops, I did it again Updated 10/25/0= 1   Hillard is suffering from soreness in his surgically-repaired foot, acc= ording to the New York Newsday . The foot was sore following the Giants gam= e against St. Louis in Week Five but it is even more sore now. Keep an eye = on this situation. This condition might force Hilliard to the sidelines if = it intensifies.     Damon Jones  , TE JAC - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01   J= ones' status for this week's game is questionable, according to The Florida=  Times-Union . He missed practice on Wednesday because of a shoulder injury= . Kyle Brady will get most of the looks at tight end if Jones is unable to = play.     Elvis Joseph  , RB JAC - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01   Joseph too= k a lot of snaps in practice Wednesday and will be incorporated in as the t= hird-down back, according to The Florida Times-Union . Joseph won't have mu= ch value in this job but he will take carries away from starter Stacey Mack= .     Tyrone Davis  , TE GB - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01   Davis could ret= urn from his hamstring injury sooner than what was originally expected, acc= ording to published reports. He might begin practicing next week and will a= lmost certainly be activated before his target date of Thanksgiving. Davis = has been sidelined since August because of hamstring surgery. Nevertheless,=  he will be the No. 2 tight end when he returns.     Elvis Grbac  , QB BAL = - Thrill Kill Cult Updated 10/25/01   Grbac will likely be a game-time deci= sion for Sunday's game, according to The Baltimore Sun . He threw very litt= le in practice and is still suffering from a sore chest. Randall Cunningham=  will start if Grbac is unable to play.      Randy Moss  , WR MIN - Meximul= lets Updated 10/25/01   Moss is suffering from tendonitis in his left Achil= les tendon, according to The Pioneer Press . Moss missed practice Wednesday=  but is expected to play on Sunday.     Tony Martin  , WR ATL - The Snake P= it Updated 10/25/01   Martin might be ready to play when the Falcons resume=  their season on November 4. He has been sidelined for the past four games = because of a broken collarbone but the Atlanta Journal-constitution reports=  that he ran routes on Wednesday and caught some passes.     Wane McGarity =  , WR DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01   The Saints have signed McGarity, = who was released by the Cowboys earlier this season. McGarity will be used = mostly on returns, but he might eventually work his way into the Saints' re= gular rotation of receivers.     Matt Stover  , K BAL - The Snake Pit Updat= ed 10/25/01   Stover has a minor leg injury that will prevent him from kick= ing off but he will be able to kick field goals, according to published rep= orts. The injury isn't considered serious but the Ravens are considering St= eve Lindsey and Jaret Holmes as candidates to handle kickoffs.     Eric Met= calf  , WR OAK - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01   The Washington Redskins sign= ed Metcalf on Wednesday. He will be used mostly as a returner and has minim= al Fantasy value.      Tim Biakabutuka  , RB CAR - The Guzzlers Updated 10/= 25/01   Biakabutuka will be out until at least training camp with a fractur= e and other structural damage to his right foot. ""He's not going to be real= ly ready to do any work that would be football related until next summer,"" = coach George Seifert said Wednesday. ""Basically, it just separated,"" Seifer= t said of the top part of Biakabutuka's foot. ""The ligaments, tendons and b= one broke, so it all had to be put back together."" Richard Huntley, who wil= l replace Biakabutuka in the starting lineup, visited his teammate at the h= ospital Tuesday. Huntley said the injury was far worse than he expected and=  he's concerned Biakabutuka won't play again.        James Stewart  , RB DE= T - The Lie Downs Updated 10/25/01   Stewart will probably play on Sunday a= gainst the Bengals. The Detroit Free Press reports that his ankle injury ha= s now been identified as a bad bruise and not a sprain.     Wayne Chrebet  = , WR NYJ - Who's Yo Daddy Updated 10/25/01   Chrebet, the New York Jets' to= p receiver, will miss Sunday's game at Carolina with a head injury. He was = hit in the helmet by St. Louis Rams' defensive tackle Brian Young on Sunday=  and left the game complaining of dizziness. It was the second consecutive = week that a head injury knocked Chrebet out of the game. He left the Jets' = win over Miami in the second half on Oct. 14. Coach Herman Edwards describe= d Chrebet's ailment as ""post-trauma migraines"" and said he wanted to be ext= ra cautious with the injury.  Edwards said Chrebet passed the various tests=  and scans he was given. Laveranues Coles will be the top receiver in his a= bsence. Rookie Kevin Swayne will move ino the starting lineup.       Terrel= l Davis  , RB DEN - Meximullets Updated 10/25/01   Davis disputed rumors th= at he may have a stress fracture in his leg and could be lost for the seaso= n. ""At this point in time, I'm on schedule to play this Sunday,"" Davis said= . Davis, who has missed five games this year and 29 since 1999, admitted th= at his right knee remains sore, but he has been well enough to play on the = scout team the past two weeks. He remained on the scout team Wednesday as t= he Broncos prepared for this week's game against the New England Patriots. = Davis was listed as questionable on the weekly injury report. Don't bother = to start him. His abilities will be limited if he does play Sunday.        = Clint Stoerner  , QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01   Starting quarterba= ck Anthony Wright didn't practice Wednesday because of fluid on his right k= nee, and might not play Sunday. Head coach Dave Campo said Stoerner would s= tart ahead of Ryan Leaf, if Wright isn't ready to play. Using Stoerner in y= our starting lineup would be a risky move. Stoerner, a second-year player f= rom Arkansas, has never started in the NFL. He has played in only three gam= es, completing 4 of 7 passes for 44 yards and two touchdowns in his two app= earances this season.       Anthony Wright  , QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 1= 0/25/01   Wright didn't practice Wednesday because of fluid on his right kn= ee, and coach Dave Campo indicated Wright might not play Sunday.   Wright e= xpected to have results of an MRI exam Thursday, and Campo said he wouldn't=  make a final decision on the quarterback's playing status for the Arizona = game until after that. Campo said Clint Stoerner would start ahead of Ryan = Leaf if Wright isn't ready to play Sunday. Campo said there was a good chan= ce that Leaf could play for the Cowboys on Sunday. Leaf apparently hasn't b= een with the team long enough to merit a starting spot yet.        Terrell = Davis  , RB DEN - Meximullets Updated 10/24/01   Davis is sufficiently heal= ed from a knee injury, but now his lower left leg is giving him problems an= d will probably keep him out of action this week. X-rays revealed no stress=  fracture, says the Denver Post , but Davis' leg is throbbing. Mike Anderso= n will retain the starting job for now. If Davis is able to play, which see= ms unlikely, he will be very limited.    Amani Toomer  , WR NYG - The Fat B= astards Updated 10/24/01   According to published reports, Toomer might be = benched in favor of WR Joe Jurevicius. Ike Hilliard will join Jurevicius if=  Toomer is demoted. Toomer caught only three passes Monday night against th= e Eagles and did not have a reception for more than 10 yards. Head coach Ji= m Fassel demoted Toomer last season, in an effort to motivate him.     Wayn= e Chrebet  , WR NYJ - Who's Yo Daddy Updated 10/24/01   Chrebet will miss S= unday's game at Carolina with a head injury. Coach Herman Edwards described=  Chrebet's ailment as ""post-trauma migraines"" and said he wanted to be extr= a cautious with the injury.   Edwards said Chrebet passed the various tests=  and scans he was given. Chrebet will be replaced by Kevin Swayne, a 26-yea= r-old rookie who played in both the Arena League and the XFL during the pas= t year. He has now been playing football for 40 straight weeks and has one = catch for 19 yards in the NFL.      Chris Sanders  , WR TEN - Free Agent Up= dated 10/24/01   Sanders will not require surgery on his back. He will be r= e-evaluated after receiving an injection. His return date is unclear.

"Yo Lenny, Glad you finally pulled your big head out of Chemosabe's ass and decided to chat with us.  Thanks for looking us up when you came to New Orleans, I guess since none of us drink Jamison and wack off to the Sundance film festival we're not cool...  Anyways, thanks for letting us stay at your maw's place when we go skiing. Yes I'm going bald but your maw said that if you look good with hair then you'll look good without it- so this year I'll shave my sack as an added bonus...  Don't worry about saving for me a place to sleep, I'll just make a matress out of dog hair from those slobbering, gaseous, farting bulldogs your maw has.  Wish you were coming on the ski trip, but I realize the gay olympic trials are in South Beach at the same time, so I understand.  Hope you qualify.  cjrob   >From: ""Lenhart, Matthew"" <Matthew.Lenhart@ENRON.com> >To: ""ross_berthelot@bankone.com@ENRON"" ><IMCEANOTES-ross+5Fberthelot+40bankone+2Ecom+40ENRON@ENRON.com> >CC: ""Scott Naquin <naquinscott@yahoo.com>, Clint Eilbeck"" ><IMCEANOTES-+22Scott+20Naquin+20+3Cnaquinscott+40yahoo+2Ecom+3E+2C+20Clint+20Eilbeck+22@ENRON.com>, >   ""Myers Namie"" <myersnamie@yahoo.com>, ""Denis Naquin"" ><denisnaq@home.com>,   ""Tommy Porteous"" <tporteous@lemle.com>,   ""COREY >ROBICHEAUX"" <cjrob23@msn.com>, ""Tanya Flynn"" <tennis70810@yahoo.com>, >""Mike Gooch"" <mcg742000@yahoo.com>, ""Bernard Guste"" <bguste@wewill4u.com>, >  <chufft@bellsouth.net>, ""Scott Dehart"" <dehart81@hotmail.com>,   ""don >edgerton"" <edgeconstruct@aol.com> >Subject: RE: THE OFFICIAL SNOW REPORT!!!!! >Date: Wed, 24 Oct 2001 12:10:28 -0500 > >thanks for including me.  i don't think i will be able to make a ski >trip durning that period.  i have to go to miami and party on south >beach.  sorry.  maybe if something was scheduled around spring skiing >(feb-mar)  i could definately go.  robicheaux is bald?  i remember that >bastard was so hairy when i was living with him.  i used to have to >shave the soap in the shower after he used it.  i know some of the >houston guys would like to go skiing so keep us informed. > > > >  -----Original Message----- > > From:  ross_berthelot@bankone.com@ENRON > > Sent: Wednesday, October 24, 2001 10:39 AM > > To: Lenhart, Matthew > > Cc: ""Scott Naquin <naquinscott@yahoo.com>, Clint Eilbeck""; Myers > > Namie; Denis Naquin; Tommy Porteous; COREY ROBICHEAUX; Tanya Flynn; > > Mike Gooch; Bernard Guste; chufft@bellsouth.net; Scott Dehart; don > > edgerton > > Subject: RE: THE OFFICIAL SNOW REPORT!!!!! > > > > > > Lenny! jumping in the conversation without missing a beat....good to > > have > > you with us.

Thanks for looking us up when you came to New Orleans, I guess since none of us drink Jamison and wack off to the Sundance film festival we're not cool...  Anyways, thanks for letting us stay at your maw's place when we go skiing. Yes I'm going bald but your maw said that if you look good with hair then you'll look good without it- so this year I'll shave my sack as an added bonus...  Don't worry about saving for me a place to sleep, I'll just make a matress out of dog hair from those slobbering, gaseous, farting bulldogs your maw has.  Wish you were coming on the ski trip, but I realize the gay olympic trials are in South Beach at the same time, so I understand.

He was already playing with a sor= e right hip that limited him in practice last week. ""I will get an MRI in t= he morning and go from there,"" Johnson said. ""Right now, they are saying th= at it's just a bruise. But we'll know more tomorrow. I probably could not h= ave played if they needed me to. I was in pretty bad pain.""   Emmitt Smith = , RB! D! AL - Bass/Hull Updated 10/28/01 Smith pronounced himself OK despit= e having his right knee wrapped after the Dallas Cowboys' 17-3 victory over=  Arizona on Sunday. ""It's throbbing a little bit right now, but I'll be all=  right,"" Smith said. ""I felt it. I knew what it was. I didn't know the degr= ee the injury was. It worried me a bit.""   But Smith was able to walk off t= he field without assistance. He said he expects to play next week at the Ne= w York Giants. Coach Dave Campo said Smith would be re-evaluated on Monday,=  but said he was encouraged that Smith was walking around.     Daunte Culpe= pper , QB MIN - Giggles Updated 10/28/01 According to published reports, Cu= lpepper suffered a broken nose in Sunday's game against Tampa Bay. He is no= t expected to miss any game action.  Eddie Kennison , WR DEN - Free Agent U= pdated 10/28/01 Kennison rushed one time for 10 yards against New England, = and did not catch a pass. The veteran wideout has reverted back to  statist= ical silence after a brief period of productivity.   Mike Anderson , RB DEN=  - Neal/McKay Updated 10/28/01 Anderson rushed for only 40 yards on 14 carr= ies against the Patriots. He did score on an eight-yard r! un! , but the Br= oncos let Olandis Gary carry the ball 10 times for 37 yards also. Denver ap= pears to have lost some confidence in Anderson this year.  David Patten , W= R NE - Free Agent Updated 10/28/01 Patten caught five passes for 62 yards a= nd a TD at Denver. He should continue to be a scoring threat as long as he = remains one of New England's top two receivers.  Troy Brown , WR NE - Bass/= Hull Updated 10/28/01 Brown caught nine passes for 86 yards and a TD at Den= ver. He also carried the ball one time for 31 yards. Brown will always be a=  big-play threat against the weaker defensive teams on the Patriots' schedu= le.  Curtis Conway , WR SD - Giggles Updated 10/28/01 Conway caught nine pa= sses for 120 yards against Buffalo, In the past, Conway was a disappoitment= , but now he is working well with Doug Flutie and staying healthy. Conway i= s finally performing up to expectations as a Fantasy wideout.  Freddie Jone= s , TE SD - Neal/McKay Updated 10/28/01 ! Jo! nes overcame a sprained ankle=  to play against the Bills, and caught two passes for five yards. One of hi= s catches was good for a one-yard TD, and Jones may now get much of his num= bers on short TD catches. Doug Flutie seems to prefer his wideouts over the=  tight end when the Chargers are outside the red zone.  Larry Centers , RB = BUF - Free Agent Updated 10/28/01 Centers was limited to eight receiving ya= rds on four catches by San Diego. The Bills ideally want to get the ball do= wnfield to their wideouts and Jay Riemersma, so don't expect good numbers f= rom Centers ecery week.  Peerless Price  , WR BUF - Free Agent Updated 10/2= 8/01 Price caught eight passes for 151 yards and a TD at San Diego. While P= rice is still inconsistent, he appears to have improved enough to start for=  Fantasy teams occasionally.  Matt Hasselbeck , QB SEA - Bass/Hull Updated = 10/28/01 Hasselbeck had his best game as a pro, throwing for 230 yards, two=  TDs and no interceptions. But he continued to have some troubles completin= g key passes and getting the ball downfield on important downs.  Shaun Alex= ander , RB SEA - JWillie Updated 10/28/01 The Dolphins held Alexander to 87=  yards on 23 carries. Considering the strength of the Miami defense, Alexan= der's final numbers looked respectable, but he also fumbled twice. The Seat= tle RB will continue to post good yardage numbers, but the league's better = defenses might limit his overall output.  Oronde Gadsden , WR MIA - Matty U= pdated 10/28/01 Gadsden caught only one pass for 15 yards at Seattle. Miami= 's No. 1 wideout is not playing well enough to be anything more than a Fant= asy backup.  James McKnight , WR MIA - Free Agent Updated 10/28! /0!  McKni= ght caught eight passes for 94 yards and a TD at Seattle, but also lost a f= umble. The Miami receiver continues to be erratic and occasionally producti= ve.  Ron Dayne , RB NYG - Neal/McKay Updated 10/28/01 Dayne was held to jus= t 19 yards on eight carries by Washington. He is not putting up consistentl= y good numbers, and should not start for most Fantasy teams right now.  Ama= ni Toomer , WR NYG - Tori Updated 10/28/01 Toomer caught nine passes for 10= 9 yards and a TD against Washington. He rem! ai! ns a must-start Fantasy pl= ayer, no matter what the opposition is.  Stephen Davis , RB WAS - Bass/Hull=  Updated 10/28/01 Davis rushed for 107 yards against the Giants, but was he= ld out of the end zone again. He is still running for good yardage, but the=  Redskins continue to score via the pass when they are able to move the bal= l.  Tony Banks , QB WAS - Free Agent Updated 10/28/01 Banks threw for 190 y= ards, two TDs and was not intercepted by the Giants. Right, now the erratic=  QB is playing well enough to be used as a Fantasy reserve.  Duce Staley , = RB PHI - Giggles Updated 10/28/01 Staley played Sunday against Oakland but = was held to 19 yards and a touchdown on three carries, with two catches for=  35 yards. He was going up against a tough Raiders' rush defense, and shoul= d post better stats in future weeks. However, it bears noting that Correll = Buckhalter led the Eagles with seven carries, which suggests that neither b= ack is the clear go-to guy right now. That makes both risky starts.  Charli= e Garner , RB OAK - Russell Updated 10/28/01 Garner rushed 21 times for 77 = yards and a touchdown Su! nd! ay at Philadelphia. This outing could put him=  firmly in place as the Raiders' featured back while Tyrone Wheatley remain= s sidelined.  Rich Gannon , QB OAK - Martin Updated 10/28/01 Gannon passed = for just 158 yards, no touchdowns and no interceptions in Sunday's game at = Philadelphia. He was facing a tall challenge in the Eagles' secondary, and = we expect he will rebound with better stats in future weeks.  Donovan McNab= b , QB PHI - Russell Updated 10/28/01 McNabb passed for just 133 yards and = no touchdowns Sunday against Oakland, but he didn't get intercepted either.=  It was asking a lot for him to post great stats against the Raiders' defen= se, but this was still a disappointment. McNabb is in a bit of a slump righ= t now, but he should break out of it and be a useful Fantasy quarterback ov= er the second half of the season.  Michael Pittman , RB ARI - Matty Updated=  10/28/01 Pittman rushed 16 times for just 29 yards Sunday at Dallas. He ha= sn't been much better than Thomas Jones this season, and we don't think eit= her player will be a reliable Fantasy option for the remainder of the year.=   David Boston , WR ARI - Bass/Hull Updated 10/28/01 Boston caught nine pas= ses for 108 yards in Sunday's game at Dallas. While Jake Plummer has been a= n inconsistent quarterback from a Fantasy perspective, Boston has proven a = worthy player because he gets most of the looks in the Arizona passing game= . He's easily a solid No. 2 receiver on any team.  Jake Plummer , QB ARI - = Frank Updated 10/28/01 Plummer passed for 233 yards, no touchdowns and two = interceptions in Sunday's game at Dallas, further exhibiting how inconsiste= nt he can be. Unless the matchup dictates otherwise, you shouldn't rely on = him for useful stats on a weekly basis.   Cowboys , DT DAL - Free Agent Upd= ated 10/28/01 The Cowboys held the Cardinals to three points Sunday, and re= corded two sacks and two interceptions in the game. Dallas' defense has bee= n somewhat decent from a Fantasy perspective based on the matchup, but don'= t let this performance fool you into believing that this unit will give you=  consistent stats week in and week out.  Clint Stoerner , QB DAL - Free Age= nt Updated 10/28/01 Stoerner completed 9-of-18 passes for 93 yards, no touc= hdowns and an interception while rushing for seven times for 23 yards and a=  scor! e ! in Sunday's game against Arizona. These numbers aren't great for=  the Fantasy owner, and they came against a weak Cardinals' secondary. We d= on't recommend Stoerner for your team based on this outing.  Emmitt Smith ,=  RB DAL - Bass/Hull Updated 10/28/01 Smith left Sunday's game against Arizo= na late in the fourth quarter with a right knee injury after accumulating 8= 3 rushing yards on 21 carries.

He was already playing with a so= re right hip that limited him in practice last week. ""I will get an MRI in = the morning and go from there,"" Johnson said. ""Right now, they are saying t= hat it's just a bruise. But we'll know more tomorrow. I probably could not = have played if they needed me to. I was in pretty bad pain.""   Emmitt Smith=  , RB DAL - ! Ro! cks Updated 10/28/01 Smith pronounced himself OK despite = having his right knee wrapped after the Dallas Cowboys' 17-3 victory over A= rizona on Sunday. ""It's throbbing a little bit right now, but I'll be all r= ight,"" Smith said. ""I felt it. I knew what it was. I didn't know the degree=  the injury was. It worried me a bit.""   But Smith was able to walk off the=  field without assistance. He said he expects to play next week at the New = York Giants. Coach Dave Campo said Smith would be re-evaluated on Monday, b= ut said he was encouraged that Smith was walking around.     Daunte Culpepp= er , QB MIN - Hunter Shively Updated 10/28/01 According to published report= s, Culpepper suffered a broken nose in Sunday's game against Tampa Bay. He = is not expected to miss any game action.  Eddie Kennison , WR DEN - FIBSABs=  Updated 10/28/01 Kennison rushed one time for 10 yards against New England= , and did not catch a pass. The veteran wideout has reverted back to  stati= stical silence after a brief period of productivity.   Mike Anderson , RB D= EN - The Klap Updated 10/28/01 Anderson rushed for only 40 yards on 14 carr= ies against the Patriots. He did score on an eight-yard run, but the B! ro!=  ncos let Olandis Gary carry the ball 10 times for 37 yards also. Denver ap= pears to have lost some confidence in Anderson this year.  David Patten , W= R NE - Free Agent Updated 10/28/01 Patten caught five passes for 62 yards a= nd a TD at Denver. He should continue to be a scoring threat as long as he = remains one of New England's top two receivers.  Troy Brown , WR NE - The K= lap Updated 10/28/01 Brown caught nine passes for 86 yards and a TD at Denv= er. He also carried the ball one time for 31 yards. Brown will always be a = big-play threat against the weaker defensive teams on the Patriots' schedul= e.  Curtis Conway , WR SD - Baja Updated 10/28/01 Conway caught nine passes=  for 120 yards against Buffalo, In the past, Conway was a disappoitment, bu= t now he is working well with Doug Flutie and staying healthy. Conway is fi= nally performing up to expectations as a Fantasy wideout.  Freddie Jones , = TE SD - Free Agent Updated 10/28/01 Jones overc! am! e a sprained ankle to = play against the Bills, and caught two passes for five yards. One of his ca= tches was good for a one-yard TD, and Jones may now get much of his numbers=  on short TD catches. Doug Flutie seems to prefer his wideouts over the tig= ht end when the Chargers are outside the red zone.  Larry Centers , RB BUF = - Free Agent Updated 10/28/01 Centers was limited to eight receiving yards = on four catches by San Diego. The Bills ideally want to get the ball downfi= eld to their wideouts and Jay Riemersma, so don't expect good numbers from = Centers ecery week.  Peerless Price , WR BUF - Matt Lenhart  Updated 10/28/= 01 Price caught eight passes for 151 yards and a TD at San Diego. While Pri= ce is still inconsistent, he appears to have improved enough to start for F= antasy teams occasionally.  Matt Hasselbeck , QB SEA - Free Agent Updated 1= 0/28/01 Hasselbeck had his best game as a pro, throwing for 230 yards, two = TDs and no interceptions. But he continued to have some troubles completing=  key passes and getting the ball downfield on important downs.  Shaun Alexa= nder , RB SEA - The Klap Updated 10/28/01 The Dolphins held Alexander to 87=  yards on 23 carries. Considering the strength of the Miami defense, Alexan= der's final numbers looked respectable, but he also fumbled twice. The Seat= tle RB will continue to post good yardage numbers, but the league's better = defenses might limit his overall output.  Oronde Gadsden , WR MIA - Baja Up= dated 10/28/01 Gadsden caught only one pass for 15 yards at Seattle. Miami'= s No. 1 wideout is not playing well enough to be anything more than a Fanta= sy backup.  James McKnight , WR MIA - Baja Updated 10/28/01 McKnight caught=  eight passes for 94 yards and a TD at Seattle, but also lost a fumble. The=  Miami receiver continues to be erratic and occasionally productive.  Ron D= ayne , RB NYG - Martin Cuilla Updated 10/28/01 Dayne was held to just 19 ya= rds on eight carries by Washington. He is not putting up consistently good = numbers, and should not start for most Fantasy teams right now.  Amani Toom= er , WR NYG - McKay Neal Updated 10/28/01 Toomer caught nine passes for 109=  yards and a TD against Washington. He remains a must-start Fantasy player,=  no matte! r ! what the opposition is.  Stephen Davis , RB WAS - Matt Lenha= rt Updated 10/28/01 Davis rushed for 107 yards against the Giants, but was = held out of the end zone again. He is still running for good yardage, but t= he Redskins continue to score via the pass when they are able to move the b= all.  Tony Banks , QB WAS - Matt Lenhart Updated 10/28/01 Banks threw for 1= 90 yards, two TDs and was not intercepted by the Giants. Right, now the err= atic QB is playing well enough to be used as a Fantasy reserve.  Duce Stale= y , RB PHI - Free Agent Updated 10/28/01 Staley played Sunday against Oakla= nd but was held to 19 yards and a touchdown on three carries, with two catc= hes for 35 yards. He was going up against a tough Raiders' rush defense, an= d should post better stats in future weeks. However, it bears noting that C= orrell Buckhalter led the Eagles with seven carries, which suggests that ne= ither back is the clear go-to guy right now. That makes both risky starts. =  Charlie Garner , RB OAK - Hunter Shively Updated 10/28/01 Garner rushed 21=  times for 77 yards and a touchdown ! Su! nday at Philadelphia. This outing=  could put him firmly in place as the Raiders' featured back while Tyrone W= heatley remains sidelined.  Rich Gannon , QB OAK - McKay Neal Updated 10/28= /01 Gannon passed for just 158 yards, no touchdowns and no interceptions in=  Sunday's game at Philadelphia. He was facing a tall challenge in the Eagle= s' secondary, and we expect he will rebound with better stats in future wee= ks.  Donovan McNabb , QB PHI - Eric Bass Updated 10/28/01 McNabb passed for=  just 133 yards and no touchdowns Sunday against Oakland, but he didn't get=  intercepted either. It was asking a lot for him to post great stats agains= t the Raiders' defense, but this was still a disappointment. McNabb is in a=  bit of a slump right now, but he should break out of it and be a useful Fa= ntasy quarterback over the second half of the season.  Michael Pittman , RB=  ARI - Martin Cuilla Updated 10/28/01 Pittman rushed 16 times for just 29 y= ards Sunday at Dallas. He hasn't been much better than Thomas Jones this se= ason, and we don't think either player will be a reliable Fantasy option fo= r the remainder of the year.  David Boston , WR ARI - The Klap Updated 10/2= 8/01 Boston caught nine passes for 108 yards in Sunday's game at Dallas. Wh= ile Jake Plummer has been an inconsistent quarterback from a Fantasy perspe= ctive, Boston has proven a worthy player because he gets most of the looks = in the Arizona passing game. He's easily a solid No. 2 receiver on any team= .  Jake Plummer , QB ARI - Baja Updated 10/28/01 Plummer passed for 233 yar= ds, no touchdowns and two interceptions in Sunday's game at Dallas, further=  exhibiting how inconsistent he can be. Unless the matchup dictates otherwi= se, you shouldn't rely on him for useful stats on a weekly basis.   Cowboys=  , DT DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/28/01 The Cowboys held the Cardinals to t= hree points Sunday, and recorded two sacks and two interceptions in the gam= e. Dallas' defense has been somewhat decent from a Fantasy perspective base= d on the matchup, but don't let this performance fool you into believing th= at this unit will give you consistent stats week in and week out.  Clint St= oerner , QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/28/01 Stoerner completed 9-of-18 pa= sses for 93 yards, no touchdowns and an interception while rushing for seve= n times for 23 yards and a score in Sun! da! y's game against Arizona. Thes= e numbers aren't great for the Fantasy owner, and they came against a weak = Cardinals' secondary. We don't recommend Stoerner for your team based on th= is outing.  Emmitt Smith , RB DAL - Rocks Updated 10/28/01 Smith left Sunda= y's game against Arizona late in the fourth quarter with a right knee injur= y after accumulating 83 rushing yards on 21 carries. He will be evaluated s= hortly.  Rob Johnson , QB BUF - Martin Cuilla Updated 10/28/01 Johnson left=  Sunday's game in the third quarter with an apparent knee injury. He was ta= ken to the locker room for further examination and was briefly replaced by = Alex Van Pelt before he returned.

I usually use the BCC field when sending smack notes like this so everybody won't get barraged with weak Reply All's from recipients who think they can go toe to toe with me in e-mail smack (i.e. Val and his weak shit he likes to send). This time is different because I think y'all should know who your fellow pathetic smack talking LSU fans are. Y'all can start a new support group - called ""Vassigh's College Football Smacked down Bitches - that got their cakeholes shut by Chris Simms, Cedric Benson, and Roy Williams et al"" Y'all have dished it all out, so I do not feel bad for rubbing salt into the fatal wound that Ole Miss delivered you and your team Saturday night.  Here a couple of smack statements made by some if not all of the cajun's included in this e-mail header.    ""Simms sucks, how could he be a preseason heisman candidate?"" - Over his    last three games, Simms is 59-of-88 (67.0 percent) for 698 yards and 12    touchdowns passing 2 touchdowns rushing with just one interception    (176.41 rating).  He has just started about ONE full seasons worth of    games recently and is coming into his own.  Simms will be a top NFL pick    as will Roy Williams and Cedric Benson.  I can't think of any College    Football team in history with the high caliber triple threat that UT has    with Simms, Benson, and Williams.    ""The SEC is the best conference in football, the Big XII Sucks"" - What a    joke that statement is.    ""LSU would whip UT""  - Yeah right - LSU Could not beat Rice.    ""UT is the most overrated team in college football"" - interesting since    they are higher ranked now in November than they were in the preseason    polls.    ""Mack Brown can only recruit - he can't coach worth a damn - Nick Saban    is better"" - Mack Brown has one loss - he hasn't lost in Austin since he    has been coach - while Saban has led LSU to three losses - 2 in the Red    Stick - just THIS SEASON.  Every college football analyst would agree no conference compares to the Big XII. The BIG XII have 3 TEAMS RANKED IN THE TOP 5 early November - unbelievable! Two of the top ranked BIG XII team's only losses were to the other top ranked BIG XII school.  UT loss to OU and OU loss to Nebraska. The only way the best teams in the Big XII lose is when they have to play against each other. The highest ranked SEC team (Florida) lost to Auburn which lost to pathetic Arkansas.  All football players worth a damn have left y'alls God Forsaken state. Peyton to Tennessee, Marshall Faulk to SDSU, the newest Manning to Ole Miss that just whipped up on y'alls 3rd world state university in the Red Stick on national television on a cool October Saturday night. Cajuns like Jake Delhomme and Bobby Bouchieaux stay in Lousyanna to play college ball though - that's some encouraging news for y'all. I can't think of one LSU player that has ever done shit in the NFL. NFL teams have gotten screwed every time they drafted a Lousyanna State football player. David Lafleur, Kevin Faulk, Harvey Williams, Eddie Kennison - the list goes on and on.  It is really pathetic. Texas has just RECENTLY produced dominating hausses like Ricky, Tony Brackens, Dan Neil, Shaun Rogers, Leonard Davis, Priest Holmes, Blake Brockermeyer, Bryant Westbrook, and many others.  Look at Eric Metcalf in his first game back to the NFL for the Redskins - breaking NFL records. Texas players are magic baby. Not to mention legends like the Tyler Rose, Tom Landry, Bobby Layne, and Tommy Nobis  I hope y'all enjoy Shreveport on a cold December night while y'all attend Lousyanna States bowl game against Fresno State at the Independence bowl. At least you can enjoy the New Years holiday by watching the NFL like offense of The University of Texas Longhorns play in a BCS bowl and God willing with some magic from TAMU over the Texas Traitor filled roster of OU and some other help - watch UT vs. Miami in the Rose Bowl.  I guess that smack from Elliot saying Rohan was better than Simms seems pretty foolish to you now doesn't it. That dude needs to play linebacker if he wants to get in the NFL.  He might have a decent arm but he has no clue in the pocket,  The difference between how Eli Manning ran the passing game and Rohan did for LSU Saturday night showed LSU's deficiency at the QB position.  Fumbling, bumbling, stumbling is the best way to describe his play.  CKL - you better buy your family Christmas gifts from the dollar store because you need to save your money to pay on the $500 bet you made with me the night of Val's wedding in that little bar in Natchez, Mississippi.

The bet for $500 was to go to the person whose team would be ranked higher at the end of the 2001 College Football season: Me = University of Texas You =  LSU. Well since UT is in the top 5 and with a worst case scenario would not finish out of the top 15 this year and the fact that LSU will not even finish the season ranked - you need to start saving your extra pocket cash - or we can work out an installment plan. Lenhart was a witness as well was another of Val's amigos (I forgot the name but know the face).  It looks like history will keep on repeating itself with the Great State of Texas always being superior in every facet over it's little cajun neighbor to the east - Lousyanna. Texas has the winningest NFL team of all time in the Dallas Cowboys, the 3 time champions and top 4 ranked Texas Longhorns.

I usually use the BCC field when sending smack notes like this so everybody won't get barraged with weak Reply All's from recipients who think they can go toe to toe with me in e-mail smack (i.e. Val and his weak shit he likes to send). This time is different because I think y'all should know who your fellow pathetic smack talking LSU fans are. Y'all can start a new support group - called ""Vassigh's College Football Smacked down Bitches - that got their cakeholes shut by Chris Simms, Cedric Benson, and Roy Williams et al"" Y'all have dished it all out, so I do not feel bad for rubbing salt into the fatal wound that Ole Miss delivered you and your team Saturday night.  Here a couple of smack statements made by some if not all of the cajun's included in this e-mail header.    ""Simms sucks, how could he be a preseason heisman candidate?"" - Over his    last three games, Simms is 59-of-88 (67.0 percent) for 698 yards and 12    touchdowns passing 2 touchdowns rushing with just one interception    (176.41 rating).  He has just started about ONE full seasons worth of    games recently and is coming into his own.  Simms will be a top NFL pick    as will Roy Williams and Cedric Benson.  I can't think of any College    Football team in history with the high caliber triple threat that UT has    with Simms, Benson, and Williams.    ""The SEC is the best conference in football, the Big XII Sucks"" - What a    joke that statement is.    ""LSU would whip UT""  - Yeah right - LSU Could not beat Rice.    ""UT is the most overrated team in college football"" - interesting since    they are higher ranked now in November than they were in the preseason    polls.

I should have college football games on all day in the house.  LSU, UT, and A&M are all off that weekend.  I'm supplying all the gatorade, ice, and anything else we may need.  Bring $5 to pay for the gatorade and whatever is left over can buy beer/go to the winners.  We will not setup teams.  You either come with your partner or come hoping that someone else needs a partner, too.  It will be a double-elimination tournament on a 8 1/2 or 9 ft. goal and scoring will go as follows: to seven by ones, winning by two or first to ten points to keep games moving.  We may need to put a time limit on games if we have too many teams.  If someone has an old TV that they can bring over, we can put it on in the garage in the backyard.  If you want to reply to me, please don't reply to all.  This invitation is not limited to people in the cc: field, but please don't invite another ten people.  We should have enough teams.

A Dow Jones Newswires Column     NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- So Enron Corp. (ENE) says it wants to be more transparent - to make its impenetrable financial results and corporate structure easier for investors and analysts to understand.   Based on its announcements Thursday, however, it still has a heck of a long way to go.    With Enron's restatement Thursday of nearly five years' worth of earnings and additional information about the maze of off-balance-sheet deals related to it, we now have a lot more information about the mess at Enron than we had 24 hours ago. But we're not much closer to understanding just what HAPPENED to leave Enron in such a mess - and that's because the company's explanations of all this continue to be dense, confusing and next to impossible to grasp.    Try this tidbit, from the Form 8-K Enron filed about the restatements Thursday with the Securities and Exchange Commission:    ""In addition, Enron's net income is reduced for specific JEDI revenues previously allocated to Chewco, relating to the appreciation in value of Enron stock, which eliminate upon consolidation. This, in effect, reduces Enron's share of JEDI's earnings.""    Huh? And no, it doesn't help you to know that ""Chewco"" is an entity that wasn't included in Enron's financial results but which Enron now admits should have been. Or that ""JEDI"" isn't a ""Star Wars"" reference but a limited partnership in which both Enron and Chewco had invested. It's still impenetrable.    Then there are the times when Enron just plain doesn't give enough information. The company says its decision that Chewco should be included in its results after all ""is based on current information that Chewco did not meet the accounting criteria to qualify as ... unconsolidated..."" Uh - okay. WHY didn't it meet the criteria, and why did Enron previously believe that it did? Enron doesn't say.    Finally, Enron makes some assertions that just make you scratch your head. The company says part of the restatement of its earnings stems from unspecified ""prior-year proposed audit adjustments and reclassifications which were determined to be immaterial in the year originally proposed.""    Hmmm. Beyond the fact that Enron doesn't elaborate on the nature of these ""audit adjustments and reclassifications,"" or why they were originally considered immaterial, consider that according to Enron's own figures in the 8-K, they add up to a negative earnings impact of $87 million since 1997. That amount doesn't sound like any definition of ""immaterial"" I've ever heard.    An Enron spokesman couldn't immediately be reached for comment.    In fairness, this lack of clarity may be all but inevitable given Enron's Byzantine structure, which involves dealings with outside but related entities that also have third parties involved, which in one case have a subsidiary that allowed Enron to hedge the risks of an investment, and in another case is selling assets purchased from Enron to OTHER entities in order to finish paying Enron for the original transaction, and ... you get the idea. It's next to impossible to make clear because Enron's structure is just too baroque to understand in the first place.    The market is plenty puzzled by all this, even in the wake of Enron's attempt to clarify things. Take a look at the company's drunken-sailor stock chart from Thursday. After news of the restatements hit, Enron stock first jumped higher, going as high as $10 a share, then soon dropped back, to as low as $8.40, as investors started to digest the details of the news. Then up again to about $9.25, then down again to its current level of around $8.50.    There's no reason investors should be confused like this. There is absolutely no reason that a reasonably intelligent layman, with an elementary working knowledge of corporate finance, should be unable to understand the regulatory filings, structure, earnings and balance sheet of any public company.    If that's happens, it's the company's fault, not the investor's - either because the company hasn't explained things well enough or because its structure is needlessly complicated to begin with. If Enron wants to get back the market's confidence, fixing that problem, one way or the other, would be a good place to start.    -By Michael Rapoport, Dow Jones Newswires; 201-938-5976; michael.rapoport@dowjones.com    Folder Name: Dynegy Inc.

""We wanted to verify that it was taken in 2001, not 1951,"" said Kelvin Datcher of the center in Montgomery that tracks incidents of bigotry. ""The kids who called us were frantic.""  The photo, and others of students in blackface wearing Afros, jewelry and jerseys with the lettering of a black fraternity, were taken this year at Halloween parties at two fraternity houses and posted on the Internet by a party-photo service.  The incident has rocked the campus of more than 22,000 students, which bills itself as ""the loveliest village on the plain"" and says it is intent on recruiting minorities. As the photos illustrate, a racist, segregated past is hard to escape.  Students at Auburn and other colleges have no personal memory of Jim Crow segregation. But when it comes to socializing, many students gravitate toward those of their own race. And social fraternities and sororities -- many of which used to enforce racial exclusionary clauses -- remain some of the last bastions of segregationist attitudes.  Last year, when a black freshman applied to the University of Georgia's all-white Alpha Gamma Delta, most of the members were adamant that she be rejected. ""If we had a black girl in our sorority, none of the fraternities would want to do anything with us,"" one was quoted as saying.  That incident came to light because one sorority member, Ali Davis, filed a racial discrimination complaint. UGA temporarily suspended Alpha Gamma Delta during an investigation. Davis, saying she felt ostracized, later left the school.  Around the country, the Kappa Alpha Order, which is fond of displaying the Confederate battle flag, has been implicated in various racial incidents in recent years, the Southern Poverty Law Center reported.  The Louisiana Tech University chapter was placed on probation after a confrontation with black football players in which frat members made racist remarks, the center said. At Millsaps College in Mississippi, Kappa Alphas dressed in Afro wigs and blackface to protest pro-minority initiatives. In February, the KA chapter at the University of North Texas received a five-year suspension for disorderly conduct and verbal intimidation after some members were accused of racist remarks.  Such antics aren't limited to Kappa Alpha or the South, the Southern Poverty Law Center said. Several fraternities and sororities at New Hampshire's Dartmouth College threw a ""ghetto party"" in which students dressed up as urban African-Americans -- a theme that has surfaced at other campuses -- while a sorority there promoted a ""slave auction"" fund-raiser. The Sigma Chi fraternity at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln burned a cross at one of its ceremonies.  Such incidents leave college administrators, especially those assigned to foster diversity, wringing their hands. ""We've been working so hard to do the right thing, and then something like this happens,"" Doyle Bickers, Auburn's director of admissions, said Wednesday of the warped Halloween humor. ""It breaks your heart.""  ""You can't escape your history,"" added Jim Hardin, an adviser in the student life center. ""When something like this comes up, the question is, 'Have you really changed, or are you just putting on a good front?' ""  What has changed at Auburn, according to many black students, who make up 7.2 percent of the student body, is the administration's swift and open reaction.  Interim President William F. Walker immediately condemned the costumes as ""shocking and outrageous"" and suspended the fraternities, Beta Theta Pi and Delta Sigma Phi. He attended a meeting of the Black Student Union and promised a thorough but swift investigation, which is expected to be completed within 10 days. Stories on the incident were displayed on the university's Web site.  Delta Sigma Phi has expelled the two members who dressed as a Klansman and his lynching victim, and suspended four others.  ""Similar things have happened before,"" said Roland Harris, a junior management information systems major and member of Phi Beta Sigma, one of four historically black fraternities on campus. ""But this time a lot of people saw it, and they have to do something.""  Auburn admitted its first black student, surrounded by 100 Alabama state troopers, in 1961. The first black man pledged a traditionally white fraternity in 1984, and there currently is one black pledge among those 24 fraternities.  Auburn's overall black population is still less than at most Southeastern Conference universities, but stepped-up recruiting efforts led to a 24 percent increase of African-Americans admitted to this year's freshman class. One sign of changing times: The university's Student Government Association president is an African-American.  ""We were finally beginning to say, 'Thank God, we're making some headway,' and here comes this sad, unfortunate, damaging incident,"" said John Bello-Ogunu, head of the university's office of multicultural affairs. ""It will no doubt be detrimental to our efforts to attract not only minority students, but faculty and other staff as well.""  Bello-Ogunu said the administration's reaction has been ""on the mark."" He added that more action is needed, including diversity training for fraternities. At the invitation of university officials and students, the Southern Poverty Law Center will conduct a ""mass workshop"" on tolerance on Wednesday.  Prentice Gilbert, an Auburn senior who oversees the campus' historically black fraternities and who has helped recruit black students, said it will take time to remedy the Halloween incident's impact.  ""I have to keep reminding myself these were the actions of a few individuals who do not represent Auburn as a whole,"" Gilbert said. ""This is the most devastating blow we could take.""  ""The bottom line is, do we really want to be the 'Auburn family'?"" he added. ""If so, we really could become the loveliest village on the plain, as our motto says.""

"what's his new job . . . table cloth ironer?  Kennison turned out to be a real disaster.  I'm beginning to think that many of our recent free agents are turning out to be other team's trash.  I guess the Tractor Traylor is not washed up, and he's a big reason why Chicago has turned it around. Though he did get on Shanny's bad side during Pryce's holdout with some things he said.  We used to have this guy named Shannon Sharpe.  He's pretty good too.  If only i could say fuck it all and just  go skiing, but it's been 70 degrees here for 5 weeks.

He may see some playing time in certain situations, but he's not=  worth starting on your Fantasy team.   Terance Mathis , WR ATL - Frank Upd= ated 11/16/01 Mathis has done nothing this season in Atlanta, making him vi= rtaully worthless to Fantasy owners. If you've still got him in a deeper le= ague, continue to sit Mathis until he shows he's worth a starting! n! od.  =  Reggie Kelly , TE ATL - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01 Kelly is doubtful for = Sunday'a game against Green Bay due to a knee injury. He'll be replaced by = Alge Crumpler, who may take over the starting job from Kelly from this poin= t on.   Tony Martin , WR ATL - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01 Martin hasn't be= en a reliable Fantasy player this season, and things won't change this week= end against Green Bay. The Packers sport a very tough pass defense, so star= ting Martin isn't advisable.    Olandis Gary , RB DEN - Frank Updated 11/15= /01 According to published reports, Gary may get consideration for a starti= ng spor this week. The Broncos have apparently lost some faith in Mike Ande= rson.   Emmitt Smith , RB DAL - Bass/Hull Updated 11/15/01 According to pub= lished reports, Smith returned to practice on Thursday. There is still no o= ffical word on hsi status for Sunday's game.  James Stewart ,! R! B DET - H= unter Updated 11/15/01 Stewart (ankle) did not practice again on Thursday. = He may miss Sunday's game against the Cardinals.   Edgerrin James , RB IND = - JWillie Updated 11/15/01 According to published reports, it has been conf= irmed that James will miss the rest of the season with a knee injury. He wi= ll need surgery to repair a torn ACL. Dominic Rhodes will start at RB for t= he rest of the year, and Kevin McDougal should be his backup.  Jeff Graham = , WR SD - Free Agent Updated 11/15/01 Graham may post good numbers at Oakla= nd. San Diego will look to the air often if the Raiders concentrate on stop= ping the run.  LaDainian Tomlinson , RB SD - Hunter Updated 11/15/01 Tomlin= son may have a disappointing outing this week. Oakland's defense will be fi= red up to stuff the run after a very poor performance at Seattle.  Jerry Ri= ce , WR OAK - Neal/McKay Updated 11/15/01 Rice has not helped his Fantasy o= wners much in recent weeks. But he is still worth a start against the incon= sistent San Diego secondary. Tim Brown , WR OAK - Martin Updated 11/15/01 B= rown should have another good game this week. He always seems to play his b= est in intradivisional matchups.  Charlie Garner , RB OAK - Russell Updated=  11/15/01 Don't expect good numbers from Garner this week. A returning Tyro= ne Wheatley will steal some of his carries against the tough San Diego run = defense.  Tyrone Wheatley , RB OAK - Giggles  Updated 11/15/01 Wheatley is = now listed as probable for Sunday's game against San Diego. He is a risky s= tart because of his recent inactivity and the strength of the San Diego def= ense.  Rich Gannon , QB OAK - Martin Updated 11/15/01 Gannon should rebound=  from a quiet week. Expect good numbers in an important home game with San = Diego.  Olandis Gary , RB DEN - Frank Updated 11/15/01 Gary was inactive fo= r the last two games, but he will now see carries again because Terrell Dav= is is inj! ur! ed. He still may not play enough to help most Fantasy teams.=   Desmond Clark , TE DEN - Free Agent Updated 11/15/01 Clark will continue = to get regular looks from Brian Griese. The Denver QB will now lean heavily=  on his TEs, because injuries and other factors have crippled the Broncos a= t wideout.  Dwayne Carswell , TE DEN - Free Agent Updated 11/15/01 Expect C= arswell to be a regular target for Brian Griese this week. Injuries at WR w= ill make the Denver TEs more important in the passing game.  Donovan McNabb=  , QB PHI - Russell Updated 11/15/01 McNabb had a huge game against Minneso= ta last weekend, and should have more success on Sunday at Dallas. He's a t= op-notch Fantasy quarterback worthy of a weekly spot in your starting lineu= p.   Freddie Mitchell , WR PHI - Free Agent Updated 11/15/01 Mitchell sprai= ned his ankle last Sunday, but is expected to play this weekend against Dal= las. He may emerge as Philadelphia's No. 2 receiver with a few more good ou= tings, and is worth stashing away on your roster.   Keith Poole , WR DEN - = Free Agent Updated 11/15/01 Poole may see a lot of action at wideout for th= e Broncos this week. Injuries have hit Denver hard, possibly pressing Poole=  into extra playing time. He has never been a reliable Fantasy wideout in t= he past, so don't use Poole until he proves he can be a factor in Denver's = passing game.  Todd Pinkston , WR PHI - Hunter Updated 11/15/01 Pinkston ha= s fallen out of favor with Fantasy owners after a strong start to the seaso= n. Unless you play in a deeper Fantasy league, Pinkston isn't even worth a = roster spot at this point.   Chad Lewis , TE PHI - Free Agent Updated 11/15= /01 Lewis had a subpar game against Minnesota last week, but he's still one=  of the better tight ends in the league. He had two touchdowns against Dall= as earlier in the year, and is worth starting in Week 10.   James Thrash , = WR PHI - Frank Updated 11/15/01 Thrash has caught four touchdown passes in = his last two games, and is worth starting this week against Dallas. He may = be inconsistent at times, but when Thrash is good, he is capable of putting=  up solid Fantasy numbers.   Brian Griese , QB DEN - Matty Updated 11/15/01=  Griese's stats may be mediocre this week. The Broncos have been hurt by in= juries at wideout, and Griese may have trouble finding open receivers downf= ield.  Joey Galloway , WR DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/15/01 Galloway was te= rrible last week against Atlanta, mostly because of Ryan Leaf's inability t= o get the ball downfield effectively. Unless you play in a deeper league, G= alloway isn't worth starting in Week 10.   Jackie Harris , TE DAL - Free Ag= ent Updated 11/15/01 Harris had two catches for eight yards and a touchdown=  last weekend, but he's been unreliable overall. Unless you play in a deepe= r Fantasy league, Harris isn't worth a roster spot.   Darrell Jackson , WR = SEA - Hunter Updated 11/15/01 Jackson has performed well this season, and h= e is a good start again this week. Expect him to challenge the Buffalo seco= ndary throughout the day.  Raghib Ismail , WR DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/1= 5/01 Ismail has been Dallas' most reliable reciever this season, which isn'= t saying much. Unless you play in a very deep league, the ""Rocket"" is bette= r left on the waiver wire.   Shaun Alexander , RB SEA - JWillie Updated 11/= 15/01 Alexander should have another standout game at Buffalo. It is doubtfu= l the Bills' defense will be able to handle him, and he should be good for = 100-plus yards and at least one TD.

He'll go u= p against a tough New England secondary in Week Ten, so avoid using him out= side of deeper leagues.   Torry Holt , WR STL - Fear Updated 11/16/01 Holt = continues to put up consistent yardage totals, but he's only scored only th= ree touchdowns this season. He'll face a tough New England secondary t! hi!=  s weekend, but he's still worth starting on your Fantasy team based on his=  potential to put up solid numbers.   Isaac Bruce , WR STL - Matt Lenhart U= pdated 11/16/01 Bruce hasn't put up the huge Fantasy totals this season, bu= t he's still one of the better wideouts in the league. He'll face CB Ty Law=  and the formidable New England secondary, but he's still worth starting ba= sed on his potential for big numbers.   Marshall Faulk , RB STL - McKay Nea= l Updated 11/16/01 Faulk had a huge game against Carolina, proving that he = is still the best Fantasy player in the league. He's a must-start every wee= k, and should post solid numbers in Week 10 against New England.   Ernie Co= nwell , TE STL - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01 Conwell has had a few down wee= ks, so starting him on your Fantasy team is somewhat of a gamble. With the = lack of depth at tight end around the league, however, starting Conwell is = something many Fantasy owners will have no choice but to do.   Richard Hunt= ley , RB CAR - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01 ! Hu! ntley will be the likely s= tarter this weekend against San Francisco, but don't be surprised if he spl= its carries with Nick Goings. Avoid starting either back in Week 10 if at a= ll possible.   Donald Hayes , WR CAR - Eric Bass Updated 11/16/01 Hayes had=  only two catches for 11 yards last weekend against St. Louis. He's been un= reliable for Fantasy owners this season, so starting him is a real gamble. =    Wesley Walls , TE CAR - Tori Kuykendall Updated 11/16/01 Walls has been = held in check over the last three weeks, but he's still one of the better t= ight ends in the league. He's had some success against San Francisco in the=  past, so starting him is advisable.   Muhsin Muhammad , WR CAR - Fear Upda= ted 11/16/01 Muhammad finally had a somewhat productive game, catching six = passes for 75 yards against St. Louis. He's had some success in the past ag= ainst this week's opponent, San Francisco, so starting him is a decent move= .   Brett Favre , QB GB - The Klap Updated 11/16/01 Favre has been one of t= he best F! an! tasy quarterbacks in the league this season. He'll face an A= tlanta team on Sunday with a very vulnerable secondary, so be sure to start=  Favre this week.   Bubba Franks , TE GB - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01 Fran= ks may not put up huge yardage numbers, but his seven touchdowns in eight g= ames makes him a valuable Fantasy player. Unless you have a better option o= n your roster, Franks is the type of tight end that should start on a weekl= y basis.    Bill Schroeder , WR GB - Rocks Updated 11/16/01 Schroeder (ankl= e) is not listed on the NFL injury report, and is expected to start on Sund= ay against Atlanta. He's a solid play this week against Atlanta, whose seco= ndary is vulnerable to strong passing teams like Green Bay.   Reuben Drough= ns , RB DET - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01 Droughns will likely split time w= ith Lamont Warren in Detroit's backfield this weekend in James Stewart's ab= sence. Neither back has much Fantasy value outside of deeper leagues, and s= tarting them is a huge gamble.   Lamont Warren , RB DET - Free Agent Update= d 11/16/01 Warren will likely start in place of the injured James Stewart o= n Sunday against Arizona. He's split carries with Reuben Droughns, and is o= nly worth starting as a last resort in larger Fantasy leagues.   Charlie Ba= tch , QB DET - Rocks Updated 11/16/01 Batch will again lose playing time to=  Mike McMahon this week. McMahon will be the No. 2 QB again, but will see p= laying time as the Lions continue to use two quarterbacks. As a result, you=  may want to look for another signal-caller to start on your Fantasy team. =    David Sloan , TE DET - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01 Sloan is an unreliabl= e tight end, which was proven in his one-catch for minus-2 yard performance=  in Week Nine. Unless you play in a deeper league, starting Sloan isn't adv= isable.   Ron Dayne , RB NYG - Martin Cuilla Updated 11/16/01 Dayne has bee= n a serious disappointment for Fantasy owners in recent weeks. He may score=  a touchdown in goal-line situations, but he's a risky pick for Fantasy own= ers overall.   Kerry Collins , QB NYG - Matt Lenhart Updated 11/16/01 Colli= ns has been inconsistent this season, but the matchup this week! a! gainst = Minnesota is very favorable. He lit up the Vikings for 381 yards passing an= d five touchdowns in last year's NFC Championship game, and is worth taking=  a chance on in Week 10.   Joe Jurevicius , WR NYG - Free Agent Updated 11/= 16/01 Jurevicius has put up some solid Fantasy numbers in certain games thi= s season, but he's been inconsistent overall. However, facing a porous Minn= esota secondary on Monday makes him worth considering in larger Fantasy lea= gues.   Frank Wycheck , TE TEN - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01 Wycheck sat ou= t practice Thursday to rest his injured ankle. He is listed as questionable=  for Sunday's game. Don't expect him to be too reliable if he plays.   Ike = Hilliard , WR NYG - Tori Kuykendall Updated 11/16/01 Hilliard has caught th= ree touchdowns in his last three games, so starting him against Minnesota i= s advisable. The Vikings' secondary is questionable at best, so look for Hi= lliard to be productive.   Amani Toomer , WR NYG - McKay Neal Updated 11/16= /01 Toomer could find some real success on Monday night against Minnesota. = The Viking! s ! sport one of the worst secondaries in the league, so starti= ng Toomer based on the matchup is a wise move.   Mike Anderson , RB DEN - T= he Klap Updated 11/16/01 Contrary to some earlier reports, Anderson will re= main the starter in Denver's backfield for now. Some reports had indicated = that Olandis Gary would start in his place.  Michael Bennett , RB MIN - Fre= e Agent Updated 11/16/01 Bennett is expected to return to action after miss= ing three game with a high ankle sprain. He'll likely split carries with Do= ug Chapman on Monday night against the Giants, making him a risky start on = your Fantasy team.   Jerome Pathon , WR IND - Martin Cuilla Updated 11/16/0= 1 Pathon (foot) is now listed as doubtful for Sunday's game. Rookie Reggie = Wayne should start in his place.  Stephen Alexander , TE WAS - Free Agent U= pdated 11/16/01 Alexander (ankle) did not practice on Thursday, and is doub= tful for Sunday's game against Denver. William ! Ra! sby and Zeron Flemiste= r will likely split time at tight end in Alexander's absence, but neither p= layer has any real Fantasy value.   Redskins , DT WAS - Rocks Updated 11/16= /01 Linebacker Lavar Arrington (ankle) is expected to play on Sunday agains= t Denver. ""We wouldn't play him if we thought he wouldn't be effective,"" Re= dskins Coach Marty Schottenheimer told the Washington Post. ""I think he'll = be effective."" He suffered the injury in a game against Seattle a few weeks=  ago.   Tyrone Wheatley , RB OAK - Tori Kuykendall Updated 11/16/01 Wheatle= y has strep throat, and missed practice on Thursday. He is now questionable=  for Sunday's game as he also makes his way back from a knee injury.   Eagl= es , DT PHI - McKay Neal Updated 11/16/01 Cornerback Bobby Taylor missed pr= actice on Wednesday with a quadriceps injury. He is expected to return to p= ractice, however, and should be ready in time for Sunday's game against Dal= las.

Charlie Garner will once again be Oakland's feature back. Zack Crockett = may be used in goal-line situations.  Frank Wycheck , TE TEN - Matty Update= d 11/16/01 According to published reports, Wycheck is expected to play half=  of Sunday's game against Cincinnati. That makes him a risky start from a F= antasy perspective.  Steve McNair , QB TEN - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01 Mc= Nair's status is still in question for Sunday's game against Cincinnati due=  to an injured right thumb. He threw the ball during individual drills Frid= ay, and according to published reports, is likely to play despite not being=  100 percent. We don't recommend McNair this week as a result.  Emmitt Smit= h , RB DAL - Bass/Hull Updated 11/16/01 Smith will return to the lineup Sun= day against Philadelphia after missing two games with a sprained right knee= . Cowboys Head Coach Dave Campo said after Friday's practice that Smith wou= ld ""be ready to play the majority of the game."" His return bumps Troy Hambr= ick to fullback, but we wouldn't recommend you use either back against the = stingy Eagles rush defense.  Frank Sanders , WR ARI - Free Agent Updated 11= /16/01 Sanders (hamstring) was added to the NFL injury report on Friday and=  is now listed as questionable for Sunday's game against Detroit.  However,=  if you're completely desperate for a wideout in a larger league this week,=  Sanders' matchup against a vulnerable Detroit secondary is worth consideri= ng as long as he's able to play.    ! Chris Weinke, QB CAR - Tori Updated 1= 1/16/01 According to published reports, Weinke will be the starting quarter= back for Sunday's game against San Francisco. However, he's not worth start= ing on your Fantasy team.   Daunte Culpepper , QB MIN - Giggles Updated 11/= 16/01 Culpepper is one pace for a good Fantasy season despite the lack of c= onsistency in Minnesota's offense this season. He's one of the better quart= erbacks in the league from a Fantasy perspective, and should be in your sta= rting lineup on a weekly basis.   Cris Carter , WR MIN - Tori Updated 11/16= /01 Carter's numbers may be down somewhat this season, but he's still too g= ood to ever consider benching. The veteran has a knack for finding the end = zone, and should have a good game against rookie CB Will Allen and the Gian= ts' secondary on Monday night.   Randy Moss , WR MIN - Russell Updated 11/1= 6/01 Moss is listed as probable for Monday's game against the N.Y. Giants d= ue to an ankle injury. He's been underachieving this season, but it's almos= t impossible to bench him based on his potential to post solid Fantasy ! nu= ! mbers.   Ricky Williams , RB NO - Bass/Hull Updated 11/16/01 Williams is = one of the better Fantasy backs in the league, and is a good player to use = on a weekly basis. He'll face an Indianapolis defense that has been underac= hieving all season long, so Williams is a must-start.     Aaron Brooks , QB=  NO - Matty Updated 11/16/01 Brooks had a big game against San Francisco la= st weekend, throwing for 347 yards and two scores. He may be a bit inconsis= tent this season, but his potential to post huge numbers makes it tough to = bench him, especially against a vulnerable Indianapolis defense.    Willie = Jackson , WR NO - Martin Updated 11/16/01 Jackson put up a huge game agains= t San Francisco last weekend, posting 11 catches and 167 yards receiving. H= e'll face a questionable Indianapolis squad that is vulnerable to the pass = in Week 10, so starting Jackson this week is a solid option.   Stephen Davi= s , RB WAS - Bass/Hull Up! da! ted 11/16/01 Davis has stepped up his play a= fter beginning the season slowly. He's averaged 112 yards rushing over his = last four games, and is once again emerging as a reliable Fantasy player. G= ive him the start in Week 10 against a Denver defense that is vulnerable to=  high scoring games.   Tony Banks , QB WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01 Ba= nks has played well of late, throwing five touchdowns in his last three gam= es. He's got a good matchup this weekend against a Denver team that can be = beaten through the air, but he's only worth considering in very deep Fantas= y leagues.   Michael Westbrook , WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01 Westb= rook has been inconsistent this season, but he has caught three touchdown p= asses in his last four games. He'll face a Denver secondary this weekend th= at is vulnerable at best, so starting him in deeper leagues is worth consid= ering.   Rod Gardner , WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01 Gardner has bee= n held in check in his last two games, catching only three passes for 38 ya= rds. He does have a favorable matchup this weekend against Denver, however,=  so starting him is a good move.   Az-Zahir Hakim , WR STL - Neal/McKay Upd= ated 11/16/01 Hakim has been inconsistent in recent weeks, so starting him = on your Fantasy team is a gamble unless the matchup is right. He'll go up a= gainst a tough New England secondary in Week Ten, so avoid using him outsid= e of deeper leagues.   Torry Holt , WR STL - Tori Updated 11/16/01 Holt con= tinues to put up consistent yardage totals, but he's only scored only three=  touchdowns this season. He'll face a tough New England secondary this week= end, but he's still worth starting on your Fantasy team based on his potent= ial to put up solid numbers.   Isaac Bruce , WR STL - Frank Updated 11/16/0= 1 Bruce hasn't put up the huge Fantasy totals this season, but he's still o= ne of the better wideouts in the league. He'll face CB Ty Law and the formi= dable New England secondary, but he's still worth starting based on his pot= ential for big numbers.   Marshall Faulk , RB STL - Matty Updated 11/16/01 = Faulk had a huge game against Carolina, proving that he is still the best F= antasy player in the league. He's a must-start every week, and should post = solid numbers in Week 10 against New England.   Ernie Conwell , TE STL - Fr= ee Agent Updated 11/16/01 Conwell has had a few down weeks, so starting him=  on your Fantasy team is somewhat of a gamble. With the lack of depth at ti= ght end around the league, however, starting Conwell is something many Fant= asy owners will have no choice but to do.   Richard Huntley , RB CAR - Russ= ell Updated 11/16/01 Huntley will be the likely starter this weekend agains= t San Francisco, but don't be surprised if he splits carries with Nick Goin= gs. Avoid starting either back in Week 10 if at all possible.   Donald Haye= s , WR CAR - Martin Updated 11/16/01 Hayes had only two catches for 11 yard= s last weekend against St. Louis. He's been unreliable for Fantasy owners t= his season, so starting him is a real gamble.    Wesley Walls , TE CAR - Fr= ee Agent Updated 11/16/01 Walls has been held in check over the last three = weeks, but he's still one of the better tight ends in the league. He's had = some success against San Francisco in the past, so starting him is advisabl= e.   Muhsin Muhammad , WR CAR - Martin Updated 11/16/01 Muhammad finally ha= d a somewhat productive game, catching six passes for 75 yards against St. = Louis. He's had some success in the past against this week's opponent, San = Francisco, so starting him is a decent move.   Brett Favre , QB GB - Frank = Updated 11/16/01 Favre has been one of the best Fantasy quarterbacks in the=  league this season. He'll face an Atlanta team on Sunday with a very vulne= rable secondary, so be sure to start Favre this week.   Bubba Franks , TE G= B - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01 Franks may not put up huge yardage numbers,=  but his seven touchdowns in eight games makes him a valuable Fantasy playe= r. Unless you have a better option on your roster, Franks is the type of ti= ght end that should start on a weekly basis.    Bill Schroeder , WR GB - Fr= ank Updated 11/16/01 Schroeder (ankle) is not listed on the NFL injury repo= rt, and is expected to start on Sunday against Atlanta. He's a solid play t= his week against Atlanta, whose secondary is vulnerable to strong passing t= eams like Green Bay.   Reuben Droughns , RB DET - Free Agent Updated 11/16/= 01 Droughns will likely split time with Lamont Warren in Detroit's backfiel= d this weekend in James Stewart's absence. Neither back has much Fantasy va= lue outside of deeper leagues, and starting them is a huge gamble.   Lamont=  Warren , RB DET - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01 Warren will likely start in = place of the injured James Stewart on Sunday against Arizona. He's split ca= rries with Reuben Droughns, and is only worth starting as a last resort in = larger Fantasy leagues.

The Fantasy Football newsletter will arrive in your e-mail inbox every Friday. We'll include news about the web site; tips on using all the features available; and answers to your player-related questions from the ""Gridiron Guru.""    [IMAGE] Inside      ? Plan for the Playoffs   ? Game-by-Game Analysis   ? Gridiron Guru   ? Tip of the Week        [IMAGE]  [IMAGE]  [IMAGE]          Plan for the Playoffs     The Fantasy season is nearing its end, and the playoffs are on the horizon. For Fantasy 2001 players, the playoffs begin with NFL week 15 (games of Dec. 22-23) and last two weeks, with the championship game in week 16 (games of Dec. 29-30.)  If you're in a Football Commissioner league, go to Schedule, Playoffs to see when your playoffs start and how many rounds they last. Of course, the matchups are probably still not determined, so you may not see teams listed in the brackets. The commissioner of your league is responsible for adding the teams to your playoff brackets at the end of your regular season.  If your team is still in contention, go to NFL Teams, Schedule and take note of the NFL teams with byes during your playoff weeks, so you know which players will be available if - and WHEN - your team competes in a playoff matchup.          Game-by-Game Analysis     Go to Players, Game Log to see how a particular player did in each game this season. The player's statistics in the common categories will be displayed for each game. If you are breaking down free agents, the game log is great way to see who's been getting the most consistent production.          Gridiron Guru     Welcome to Gridiron Guru, where we'll answer your questions about players and offer Fantasy Football roster advice. We invite you to send your own scouting reports and comments on players to: gridguru@commissioner.com . You'll get the chance to be heard by thousands of Fantasy players just like yourself!         Question - Mike Blake     I'm having trouble filling my No. 2 WR spot. Should I start Az-Zahir Hakim, Todd Pinkston or Muhsin Muhammad in week ten?    Answer - GG     Hakim is a hit-or-miss type, so he's risky. Pinkston has done nothing in his last four games, and he's losing playing time to Freddie Mitchell. Muhammad bounced back from a few bad performances to catch six passes for 75 yards last weekend against St. Louis, and has had some past success against this week's opponent, San Francisco. Go with Muhammad.        Question - Russell Brown     My league starts 2 QBs. Donovan McNabb is one  of my starters. Who else should I start? I have Tom Brady,  Vinny Testaverde and Doug Flutie.    Answer - GG     Testaverde's Fantasy value has taken a real hit this  season because of the Jets' conservative offense. Flutie  struggled last week against a bad Denver secondary, and  won't have an easier time against Oakland. We'd suggest  playing Brady, who will start against St. Louis despite the  return of Drew Bledsoe. Brady has thrown 11 touchdowns in  his last five games, and is playing too well to bench.         Question - Chris Gilcrest     Who would you start at QB this weekend: Rich  Gannon or Kerry Collins? Which one of these four RBs would  you bench: Eddie George, Michael Pittman, Mike Anderson,  Curtis Martin?     Answer - GG     Collins has the better matchup of the two QBs, but  he's far too inconsistent to start over a player like  Gannon. Oakland will be looking to bounce back from a subpar  performance against Seattle, so look for Gannon to have a  solid game. As for your second question, bench Mike  Anderson. You can't bench Martin, no matter how bad the  matchup may be. George has four touchdowns in his last three  games against Cincinnati, and is worth starting despite his  struggles this season; and Pittman's matchup against Detroit  is too good to ignore.           Tip of the Week      Keith Simmons, Boulder, CO: Can Terrell Davis ever stay  healthy? He comes back and teases Fantasy owners with his  solid play over the last two weeks, only to fall prey to  another knee injury this past Sunday. He was once the best  Fantasy player in the league, but now Davis is an  unreliable, injury-prone shell of his former self.

He may be a bit inconsistent this season, but his potenti= al to post huge numbers makes it tough to bench him, especially against a v= ulne! ra! ble Indianapolis defense.    Willie Jackson , WR NO - Free Agent = Updated 11/16/01 Jackson put up a huge game against San Francisco last week= end, posting 11 catches and 167 yards receiving.

Rod Gardner , W= R WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01 Gardner has been held in check in his l= ast two games, catching only three passes for 38 yards. He does have a favo= rable matchup this weekend against Denver, however, so starting him is a go= od move.   Az-Zahir Hakim , WR STL - FIBSABs  Updated 11/16/01 Hakim has be= en inconsistent in recent weeks, so starting him on your Fantasy team is a = gamble unless the matchup is right. He'll go up against a tough New England=  secondary in Week Ten, so avoid using him outside of deeper leagues.   Tor= ry Holt , WR STL - Fear Updated 11/16/01 Holt continues to put up consisten= t yardage totals, but he's only scored only three touchdowns this season.

Marshall Faulk , RB STL - McKay Neal Updated 11/16/01 Faulk had a=  huge game against Carolina, proving that he is still the best Fantasy play= er in the league.

Donald Hayes , = WR ! CA! R - Eric Bass Updated 11/16/01 Hayes had only two catches for 11 y= ards last weekend against St. Louis.

He is one of three Eagles who will be held out of the ga= me. Brian Mitchell will likely serve as Duce Staley's backup.  Jamal Lewis = , RB BAL - Free Agent Updated 11/17/01 According to published reports, Lewi= s has been suspended for four games. Lewis' four-game suspension went into = effect on Friday and he will not be allowed to work out or reha! bi! litate=  with the team for four weeks, or until Dec. 17. Instead, Lewis will work t= oward recovering from a torn ACL in Tennessee.   Tyrone Wheatley , RB OAK -=  Giggles Updated 11/16/01 Wheatley (knee) is out for Sunday's game with the=  Chargers. Charlie Garner will once again be Oakland's feature back. Zack C= rockett may be used in goal-line situations.  Frank Wycheck , TE TEN - Matt= y Updated 11/16/01 According to published reports, Wycheck is expected to p= lay half of Sunday's game against Cincinnati. That makes him a risky start = from a Fantasy perspective.  Steve McNair , QB TEN - Free Agent Updated 11/= 16/01 McNair's status is still in question for Sunday's game against Cincin= nati due to an injured right thumb. He threw the ball during individual dri= lls Friday, and according to published reports, is likely to play despite n= ot being 100 percent. We don't recommend McNair this week as a result.  Emm= itt Smith , RB DAL - Bass/Hull Updated 11/16/01 Smith will return to the li= neup Sunday against Philadelphia after missing two games with a sprained ri= ght knee. Cowboys Head Coach Dave Campo said after Friday's practice that S= mith would ""be ready to play the majority of the game."" His return bumps Tr= oy Hambrick to fullback, but we wouldn't recommend you use either back agai= nst the stingy Eagles rush defense.  Frank Sanders , WR ARI - Free Agent Up= dated 11/16/01 Sanders (hamstring) was added to the NFL injury report on Fr= iday and is now listed as questionable for Sunday's game against Detroit.  = However, if you're completely desperate for a wideout in a larger league th= is week, Sanders' matchup against a vulnerable Detroit secondary is worth c= onsidering as long as he's able to play.   Chris Weinke , QB CAR - Tori Upd= ated 11/16/01 According to published reports, Weinke will be the starting q= uarterback for Sunday's game against San Francisco. However, he's not worth=  starting on your Fantasy team.   Daunte Culpepper , QB MIN - Giggles Updat= ed 11/16/01 Culpepper is one pace for a good Fantasy season despite the lac= k of consistency in Minnesota's offense this season. He's one of the better=  quarterbacks in the league from a Fantasy perspective, and should be in yo= ur starting lineup on a weekly basis.   Cris Carter , WR MIN - Tori Updated=  11/16/01 Carter's numbers may be down somewhat this season, but he's still=  too good to ever consider benching. The veteran has a knack for finding th= e end zone, and should have a good game against rookie CB Will Allen and th= e Giants' secondary on Monday night.   Randy Moss , WR MIN - Russell Update= d 11/16/01 Moss is listed as probable for Monday's game against the N.Y. Gi= ants due to an ankle injury. He's been underachieving this season, but it's=  almost impossible to bench him based on his potential to post solid Fantas= y numbers.   Ricky Williams , RB NO - Bass/Hull Updated 11/16/01 Williams i= s one of the better Fantasy backs in the league, and is a good player to us= e on a weekly basis. He'll face an Indianapolis defense that has been under= achieving all season long, so Williams is a must-start.     Aaron Brooks , = QB NO - Matty Updated 11/16/01 Brooks had a big game against San Francisco = last weekend, throwing for 347 yards and two scores. He may be a bit incons= istent this season, but his potential to post huge numbers makes it tough t= o bench him, especially against a vulnerable In! di! anapolis defense.    W= illie Jackson , WR NO - Martin Updated 11/16/01 Jackson put up a huge game = against San Francisco last weekend, posting 11 catches and 167 yards receiv= ing. He'll face a questionable Indianapolis squad that is vulnerable to the=  pass in Week 10, so starting Jackson this week is a solid option.   Stephe= n Davis , RB WAS - Bass/Hull Updated 11/16/01 Davis has stepped up his play=  after beginning the season slowly. He's averaged 112 yards rushing over hi= s last four games, and is once again emerging as a reliable Fantasy player.=  Give him the start in Week 10 against a Denver defense that is vulnerable = to high scoring games.   Tony Banks , QB WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01 = Banks has played well of late, throwing five touchdowns in his last three g= ames. He's got a good matchup this weekend against a Denver team that can b= e beaten through the air, but he's only worth considering in very deep Fant= asy leagues.   Michael Westbrook , WR WAS - Free Agent ! Updated 11/16/01 W= estbrook has been inconsistent this season, but he has caught three touchdo= wn passes in his last four games. He'll face a Denver secondary this weeken= d that is vulnerable at best, so starting him in deeper leagues is worth co= nsidering.   Rod Gardner , WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01 Gardner has=  been held in check in his last two games, catching only three passes for 3= 8 yards. He does have a favorable matchup this weekend against Denver, howe= ver, so starting him is a good move.   Az-Zahir Hakim , WR STL - Neal/McKa!=  y ! Updated 11/16/01 Hakim has been inconsistent in recent weeks, so start= ing him on your Fantasy team is a gamble unless the matchup is right. He'll=  go up against a tough New England secondary in Week Ten, so avoid using hi= m outside of deeper leagues.   Torry Holt , WR STL - Tori Updated 11/16/01 = Holt continues to put up consistent yardage totals, but he's only scored on= ly three touchdowns this season. He'll face a tough New England secondary t= his weekend, but he's still worth starting on your Fantasy team based on hi= s potential to put up solid numbers.   Is! aa! c Bruce , WR STL - Frank Upd= ated 11/16/01 Bruce hasn't put up the huge Fantasy totals this season, but = he's still one of the better wideouts in the league. He'll face CB Ty Law a= nd the formidable New England secondary, but he's still worth starting base= d on his potential for big numbers.   Marshall Faulk , RB STL - Matty Updat= ed 11/16/01 Faulk had a huge game against Carolina, proving that he is stil= l the best Fantasy player in the league. He's a must-start every week, and = should post solid numbers in Week 10 against New England.   Ernie! C! onwel= l  , TE STL - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01 Conwell has had a few down weeks,=  so starting him on your Fantasy team is somewhat of a gamble. With the lac= k of depth at tight end around the league, however, starting Conwell is som= ething many Fantasy owners will have no choice but to do.   Richard Huntley=  , RB CAR - Russell Updated 11/16/01 Huntley will be the likely starter thi= s weekend against San Francisco, but don't be surprised if he splits carrie= s with Nick Goings. Avoid starting either back in Week 10 if at all possibl= e.   Donald Hayes , ! WR! CAR - Martin Updated 11/16/01 Hayes had only two = catches for 11 yards last weekend against St. Louis. He's been unreliable f= or Fantasy owners this season, so starting him is a real gamble.    Wesley = Walls , TE CAR - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01 Walls has been held in check o= ver the last three weeks, but he's still one of the better tight ends in th= e league. He's had some success against San Francisco in the past, so start= ing him is advisable.   Muhsin Muhammad , WR CAR - Martin Updated 11/16/01 = Muhammad finally had a somewhat productive game, catching six passes for 75=  yards against St. Louis. He's had some success in the past against this we= ek's opponent, San Francisco, so starting him is a decent move.   Brett Fav= re , QB GB - Frank Updated 11/16/01 Favre has been one of the best Fantasy = quarterbacks in the league this season. He'll face an Atlanta team on Sunda= y with a very vulnerable secondary, so be sure to start Favre this week.   = Bubba Franks , TE GB - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01 Franks may not put up hu= ge ! ya! rdage numbers, but his seven touchdowns in eight games makes him a=  valuable Fantasy player. Unless you have a better option on your roster, F= ranks is the type of tight end that should start on a weekly basis.    Bill=  Schroeder , WR GB - Frank Updated 11/16/01 Schroeder (ankle) is not listed=  on the NFL injury report, and is expected to start on Sunday against Atlan= ta. He's a solid play this week against Atlanta, whose secondary is vulnera= ble to strong passing teams like Green Bay.

The rookie has mis= sed too much time to make a Fantasy impact this season.   Richard Huntley ,=  RB CAR - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01 Huntley actually had a good outing ag= ainst San Francisco, posting 94 scrimmage yards and a touchdown. However, h= e's far too inconsistent to start on a weekly basis.  ! Chris Weinke , QB C= AR - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01 Weinke started Sunday's game against San F= rancisco after missing last week's game due to a shoulder injury. He put up=  decent numbers, throwing for 177 yards and two touchdowns in Carolina's 25= -22 OT loss.   Wayne Chrebet , WR NYJ - Fear Updated 11/18/01 Chrebet did n= ot catch a pass at Miami. The Jets' wideout is no longer worthy of a starti= ng spot on Fantasy teams.   Garrison Hearst , RB SF - Free Agent Updated 11= /18/01 Hearst had another strong game, posting 113 scrimmage yards against = Carolina. His comeback from a serious ankle condition is nothing short of m= iraculous, and he's actually been a reliable Fantasy player over the last t= wo weeks.   Alex Van Pelt , QB BUF - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01 Van Pelt t= hrew for 316 yards, two TDs and no interceptions against the Seahawks. He d= id lose a fumble, but Van Pelt got solid protection for most of the game an= d will be a respectable Fantasy backup while he fills in for the injured Ro= b Johnson.  Jeff Garcia , QB SF - Martin Cuilla Updated 11/18/01 Garcia had=  another huge game, posting 305 yards and three touchdowns against Carolina= . He's been one of the top three Fantasy quarterbacks this season, and may = even be more valuable than Peyton Manning at this point.   Peerless Price ,=  WR BUF - Matt Lenhart Updated 11/18/01 Price caught 10 passes for 138 yard= s and a TD against Seattle. He has clearly become Buffalo's best Fantasy pl= ayer this season.  Matt Hasselbeck , QB SEA - Free Agent  Updated 11/18/01 = Hasselbeck threw for 134 yards, one TD and no interceptions at Buffalo. The=  Seattle QB is making less mistakes, yet he doesn't help Fantasy teams much= , either.  Jon Kitna , QB CIN - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01 Kitna put up 23= 4 yards passing and a touchdown against Tennessee, but two interceptions ma= de his performance mediocre. He's no better than a reserve Fantasy player a= t this point, best used when the matchup is right in a deeper league.   Kor= en Robinson , WR SEA - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01 Robinson caught two pass= es for 15 yards at Buffalo, including his first career TD, a seven-yarder. = Robinson is slowly improving, but still does not produce enough to be a rel= iable Fantasy player.  Corey Dillon , RB CIN - Matt Lenhart Updated 11/18/0= 1 Dillon was held in check by Tennessee, rushing for only 38 yards on Sunda= y. However, with all the injured running backs around the league this seaso= n, Dillon is still a must-start on a weekly basis.   Steve McNair , QB TEN = - Rocks Updated 11/18/01 McNair played despite a sore thumb, throwing for 1= 72 yards and a touchdown against Cincinnati. He's been an unreliable Fantas= y player this season, and is worth starting only when the matchup is right.=    Eddie George , RB TEN - Fear Updated 11/18/01 George was unimpressive on= ce again, posting only 65 scrimmage yards on Sunday against Cincinnati. He = just doesn't seem to be at full speed this season, and has been a huge Fant= asy disappointment.   Ricky Williams , RB NO - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01 = Williams had a big game on Sunday, rushing for ! 12! 0 yards and a touchdow= n against Indianapolis. He continues to prove his value as a Fantasy player= , and is a must-start ever week.   Aaron Brooks , QB NO - Free Agent Update= d 11/18/01 Brooks had an outstanding game against Indianapolis, throwing fo= r 249 yards and two touchdowns. He's put together two straight solid games,=  and may finally be reaching the potential the coaching staff knew he was c= apable of.   Peyton Manning , QB IND - Tori Kuykendall Updated 11/18/01 Man= ning put up a decent performance against New Orleans, posting 262 yards and=  a touchdown. He may not be putting up Manning-like numbers this season, bu= t he's still far too valuable to ever consider benching.   Marcus Pollard ,=  TE IND - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01 Pollard had a huge game on Sunday, ca= tching three passes for 126 yards and a touchdown against New Orleans. He m= ay not be the most consistent Fantasy player, but the lack of tight end dep= th around the league makes him a valuable commodity.   Donovan McNabb , QB = PHI - Eric Bass Updated 11/18/01 McNabb was unimpressive on Sunday, compili= ng only 153 scrimmage yards and a touchdown against Dallas. Despite the med= iocre performance, McNabb is still one of the best Fantasy quarterbacks in = the league.   Ryan Leaf , QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01 Leaf was hor= rible for the second straight week, throwing for only 102 yards with two in= terceptions. Incidently, both picks were returned for touchdowns as Dallas = fell to Philadelphia, 36-3.   Emmitt Smith , RB DAL - Rocks Updated 11/18/0= 1 Smith left Sunday's game against Philadelphia in the second half with an = apparent knee injury. He did not return to the game, and finished the day w= ith 90 scrimmage yards and a fumble.   Tyrone Wheatley , RB OAK - Tori Kuyk= endall Updated 11/18/01 Wheatley (knee) had been declared inactive for Sund= ay's game against San Diego.

Fr= eddie Jones, TE SD - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01 Jones (ankle) has been dec= lared inactive for Sunday's game. He has been advised not to play for two w= eeks.  Fred Taylor , RB JAC - Hunter Shively Updated 11/18/01 Taylor (groin= ) has been declared inactive for Sunday's game against Pittsburgh. Stacey M= ack will make the start in his absence, with Elvis Joseph seeing some actio= n as well.   Mark Brunell , QB JAC - Top Dogs! Updated 11/18/01 Brunell (qu= adriceps) has been declared inactive for Sunday's game. Jonathan Quinn will=  start in his place.  Cameron Cleeland , TE NO - Free Agent Updated 11/18/0= 1 Cleeland (ankle) has been declared inactive for Sunday's game against Ind= ianapolis. Boo Williams and Lamont Hall will split time at tight end in his=  absence.   Dez White , WR CHI - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01 White (ankle) = will start Sunday's game. He still may not do much against the Tampa Bay de= fense.   James Jackson , RB CLE - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01 Jackson (ankl= e) did not start in Sunday's game. Jamel White started against the Ravens. =   Steve McNair , QB TEN - Rocks Updated 11/18/01 McNair will start Sunday's=  game against Cincinnati as long after taking pre-game snaps without any pr= oblems.

Quincy = Carter! , QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/19/01Carter feels as though his ha= mstring has healed enough that he's ready to return to action. However, the=  Cowboys will start Ryan Leaf for a few more weeks before Carter gets his s= tarting job back. The team wants to evaluate Leaf in a few games this seaso= n to determine if he'll have any trade value in the offseason.  James Jacks= on , RB CLE - Hunter Updated 11/19/01 Jackson told the Cleveland Plain-Deal= er it was a coach's decision not to use him against the Ravens. Jackson had=  been suffering from an ankle injury, but reports prior to gametime had ind= icated he might have been able to play. With the sudden emergence of Benjam= in Gay, Jackson's Fant! as! y value might drop greatly.  Ryan Leaf , QB DAL=  - Free Agent Updated 11/19/01 Leaf had another terrible outing this weeken= d, but the Dallas Morning News is reporting that he'll remain the team's st= arting quarterback for the time being. However, he's no better than waiver = wire fodder in Fantasy Football.   Kevin Lockett , WR WAS - Free Agent Upda= ted 11/19/01 Lockett left Sunday's game against Denver in the first quarter=  due to a rib injury.

Mike Anderson , RB DEN - Neal/McKay Update= d 11/18/01 Anderson rushed for only 31 yards on 13 carries against the Reds= kins. Olandis Gary carried the ball ! 10! times for 28 yards. It is apparen= t Anderson is no longer worthy of a starting spot on Fantasy teams, and Gar= y will continue to see some work at his expense.  Michael Westbrook , WR WA= S - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01 Westbrook caught nine passes for 104 yards = and a TD at Denver. Opposing defenses are focusing on rookie Rod Gardner, a= nd Westbrook is getting open often after starting the year slowly.  Jake Pl= ummer , QB ARI - Frank Updated 11/18/01 Plummer threw for 334 yards, four T= Ds and was intercepted once by Detroit.

Lamont Warren , RB DET - Free Agen= t Updated 11/18/01 Warren rushed for 32 yards and a TD at Arizona and caugh= t 11 passes for 64 yards and a score. The Lions will continue to feature Wa= rren on third downs and near the goal line as a receiver, making him a good=  Fantasy backup for the rest of the year.  Warrick Dunn , RB TB - Martin Up= dated 11/18/01 Dunn caught 12 passes for 138 yards against the Bears, but h= e rushed for only 12 yards and fumbled twice. Don't count on Dunn for consi= stently good Fantasy numbers during the next few weeks. He can be explosive= , but he is also erratic.  Keyshawn Johnson , WR TB - Giggles Updated 11/18= /01 Johnson caught 12 passes for 89 yards against the Bears, but he failed = to get in the end zone again. Don't depend on Johnson down the stretch unle= ss your team is very thin at wideout.  David Terrell , WR CHI - Free Agent = Updated 11/18/01 Terrell caught! o! ne pass for 15 yards at Tampa Bay. The = rookie wideout is not consistent enough to start for most Fantasy teams.  M= arty Booker , WR CHI - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01 Booker caught seven pass= es for 165 yards and three TDs at Tampa Bay. In his third season, Booker ha= s become a superb Fantasy wideout. He is a player you must start every week= , no matter what matchup he faces.   Plaxico Burress , WR PIT - Free Agent = Updated 11/18/01 The Jaguars limited Burress to one catch for 13 yards. The=  second-year receiver has still not proven he can be a reliable Fantasy pla= yer.  LaDainian Tomlinson , RB SD - Hunter Updated 11/18/01 Tomlinson put u= p decent rushing numbers against Oakland, posting 68 yards and a touchdown.=  His overall statistics have been down in recent weeks, however, which may = have something to do with the fact that he held out for the entire preseaso= n.   Hines Ward , WR PIT - Tori Updated 11/18/01 Ward caught nine passes fo= r 112 yards and a TD against Jac! ks! onville. While he doesn't score often= , Ward has become a very solid receiver for Pittsburgh this year, and he wi= ll always post respectable totals.  Doug Flutie , QB SD - Russell Updated 1= 1/18/01 Flutie's recent struggles continued against Oakland, throwing for o= nly 98 yards on Sunday. Unless he faces a good matchup, starting Flutie is = becoming somewhat of a gamble.   Stacey Mack , RB JAC - Hunter Updated 11/1= 8/01 Mack was held to six rushing yards on eight carries at Pittsburgh. He = has not been a reliable back for the Jaguars or Fantasy owners this season.=   Rich Gannon , QB OAK - Martin Updated 11/18/01 Gannon had a solid outing = against San Diego, throwing for 311 yards and four touchdowns. He's one of = the top five Fantasy quarterbacks in the league and is a must-start every w= eek.

Rod Smith , WR DEN - Baja Updated 11/19/01 ! Sm! ith (ankle)=  could not finish Sunday's game. His status for Thursday's game against Dal= las is unclear.  Terance Mathis , WR ATL - McKay Neal Updated 11/19/01 Math= is has by far his best game of the season, catching seven passes for 70 yar= ds against Green Bay. He suffered a mild concussion in the game, but he's e= xpected to be fine for this weekend's contest at Carolina.   Jackie Harris = , TE DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/19/01 Harris suffered a strained right ham= string during Sunday's game against Philadelphia.

Frank Sanders , WR ARI - Baja Updat= ed 11/19/01 Sanders had a huge game against Detroit on Sunday, catching sev= en passes for 127 yards and a touchdown. He injured his hamstring in the ga= me, however, and is listed as day to day.   Quincy Carter , QB DAL - Free A= gent Updated 11/19/01 Carter feels as though his hamstring has healed enoug= h that he's ready to return to action. However, the Cowboys wil! l ! start = Ryan Leaf for a few more weeks before Carter gets his starting job back. Th= e team wants to evaluate Leaf in a few games this season to determine if he= 'll have any trade value in the offseason.   James Jackson , RB CLE - Free = Agent Updated 11/19/01 Jackson told the Cleveland Plain-Dealer it was a coa= ch's decision not to use him against the Ravens. Jackson had been suffering=  from an ankle injury, but reports prior to gametime had indicated he might=  have been able to play. With the sudden emergence of Benjamin Gay, Jackson= 's Fantasy value might drop greatly.  Ryan Leaf , QB DAL - Free Agent  Upda= ted 11/19/01 Leaf had another terrible outing this weekend, but the Dallas = Morning News is reporting that he'll remain the team's starting quarterback=  for the time being. However, he's no better than waiver wire fodder in Fan= tasy Football.   Kevin Lockett , WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/19/01 Locke= tt left Sunday's game against Denver in the first quarter due to a rib inju= ry. His status for next week's game against Philadelphia is uncertain at th= is time.

Mike Anderson , RB DEN - The Klap Updated 11/18/01 Anderson rushed fo= r only 31 yards on 13 carries against the Redskins. Olandis Gary carried th= e ball 10 times for 28 yards. It is apparent Anderson is no longer worthy o= f a starting spot on Fantasy teams, and Gary will continue to see some work=  at his expense.  Michael Westbrook , WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01 = Westbrook caught nine passes for 104 yards and a TD at Denver. Opposing def= enses are focusing on rookie Rod Gardner, and Westbrook is getting open oft= en after starting the year slowly.  Jake Plummer , QB ARI - Baja Updated 11= /18/01 Plummer threw for 334 yards, four TDs and was intercepted once by De= troit. Such stellar performances are rare for Plummer, who may not have a b= etter game this season.

Given what has transpired over the past month, it could be considered imprudent for Enron to incur the expense of such an event.  I regret that this action is necessary because I recognize that your hard work throughout the year merits a holiday celebration and so much more.  We will attempt to find other, more appropriate ways to recognize your outstanding contributions as we move into the holiday season.

He is not expected to return for another two to three weeks, meaning Shau= n Alexander will continue to be a key performer for many Fantasy teams as t= he postseason comes into view.  Doug Flutie , QB SD - Russell Updated 11/20= /01 Mike Riley told the San Diego Union-Tribune there is no QB controversy = involving Fl! ut! ie and rookie Drew Brees. ""Doug is going to be our quarte= rback,"" he said. ""You can talk about controversy all you want, but there is=  none within this building. He is our quarterback. He will start. He will g= et us the next win the next week."" Still, Flutie is not playing well enough= t to satisfy most Fantasy owners.  Mark Bruener , TE PIT - Free Agent Updat= ed 11/20/01 Bruener will miss the rest of the season after undergoing shoul= der injury. His loss may adversely affect Jerome Bettis' statistics, becaus= e Bruener is widely regarded as the best run-blocking tight end in football= .  Tyrone Wheatley  , RB OAK - Giggles Updated 11/20/01 Wheatley told the C= ontra-Costa Times he is no longer being bothered by a knee injury. He expec= ts to play on Sunday.  Erron Kinney , TE TEN - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 = Kinney (calf) may play this week after missing three games. He was expected=  to return to practice early this week.  Frank Wycheck , TE TEN - Matty Upd= ated 11/20/01 Wycheck (calf) will be limited in practice this week. He may = be a risky start in Week 11.  Steve McNair , QB TEN - Free Agent Updated 11= /20/01 The Tennessean says McNair's hand was sore when he arrived at the te= am's practice facility on Monday. Jeff Fisher now says he doesn't expect hi= m to miss any practice time this week.   Derrick Alexander , WR KC - JWilli= e Updated 11/20/01 Alexander (ribs) has returned to practice. He is expecte= d to start against Seattle.  Marvin Minnis  , WR KC - Free Agent Updated 11= /20/01 Minnis (ankle) is listed as doubtful for Sunday's game. Larry Parker=  may have to start in his place,  Mark Brunell , QB JAC - JWillie Updated 1= 1/20/01 Brunell (quadriceps) might miss Sunday's game against Baltimore. Jo= nathan Quinn will start again if Brunell can't play.  Mark Brunell , QB JAC=  - JWillie Updated 11/20/01 Brunell (quadriceps) might miss Sunday's game a= gainst Baltimore. Jonathan Quinn will start again if Brunell can't play!   = Reggie Wayne , WR IND - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 Wayne has a sprained kn= ee ligament, and is doubtful for Sunday's game against New Orleans. Terrenc= e Wilkins may have to start in his place.  Jerome Pathon , WR IND - Tori Up= dated 11/20/01 Pathon (foot) is done for the season. He will be put on inju= red reserve. Reggie Wayne (knee) is also hurting, meaning Terrence Wilkins = might have to be moved back into the starting lineup.   Jay Fiedler , QB MI= A - Tori Updated 11/20/01 Dave Wannstedt told the Miami Herald there is no = QB controversy surrounding Fielder and backup Ray right now. ``That's kind = of hypothetical,'' he said. ``Jay is the starter, and my only comment is we= 're going to get it squared away and play turnover-free football.''  Rod Sm= ith , WR DEN - Matty Updated 11/20/01 Mike Shanahan said he does not know i= f Smith (ankle) will be sufficiently healed to play in Thursday's game agai= nst the Cowboys. ""We'll get a chance to evaluate that during the week and s= ee,"" Shanah! an! told the Denver Post. ""If he can help our football team, h= e'll play. If he's in a situation where he can't perform at the level that = we think can help our team, then we'll keep him out and put somebody else i= n.""   Benjamin Gay , RB CLE - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 The Cleveland Pla= in-Dealer says Butch Davis won't indicate how much Gay will play in the nea= r future. ""We'll try to get him involved in some of the games,"" Davis said.=  ""We'll see.""   Kevin Lockett , WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 Locket= t, who suffered a rib injury last weekend against Denver, expects to play o= n Sunday against Philadelphia. However, the wide receiver has no real value=  as a Fantasy player at this point.   Tony Banks , QB WAS - Free Agent Upda= ted 11/20/01 Barring any setbacks, Banks will start Sunday's game against P= hiladelphia. Banks, who suffered a concussion last weekend vs. Denver, hasn= 't been feeling any after effects of the injury and should be under center = for the 'Skins.   Jacquez Green , WR TB - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 Green=  (abdomen) ! is! expected to return to practice on Wednesday at full streng= th. He's been inconsistent this season, and is best used when the matchup i= s favorable.   Terrell Owens , WR SF - Martin Updated 11/20/01 Owens suffer= ed a sprained left knee and ankle during the overtime session of last weeke= nd's game against Carolina. The injuries aren't considered serious, however= , and Owens is expected to be in the starting lineup on Sunday Indianapolis= .   Cecil Martin , RB PHI - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 Martin suffered a h= amstring injury during Sunday's game against Dallas. He'll miss a few days = of practice, but is expected to play in this weekend's game against Washing= ton. Martin has no real value as a Fantasy player at this point.    Giants = , DT NYG - Matty Updated 11/20/01 According to the New York Post, cornerbac= k Jason Sehorn's surgically-repaired right knee began giving him problems a= gain this past weekend. In fact, the team was unsure that he'd be able to c= over either Randy Moss or Cris Carter on Monday night, but he played anyway= . If he continues to play on a bad wheel, you should consider starting any = receivers opposing Sehorn the rest of the season.   Elvis Grbac , QB BAL - = Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 The Baltimore Sun says there is no indication t= hat Grbac will be replaced as the team's starting QB. Still, he is not perf= orming well enough to start for most Fantasy teams.  Donald Driver , WR GB = - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 Driver is still dealing with a thigh injury, = and is expected to miss Thursday's game against Detroit. The reserve wideou= t has no real value as a Fantasy player at this point.    Ravens  , DT BAL = - Russell Updated 11/20/01 Defensive end Michael McCrary will miss the rest=  of the season after undergoing knee surgery. His loss will certainly lower=  the sack output of the Baltimore defense and may mean the team will allow = more passing yardage than usual.    Cowboys , DT DAL - Free Agent Updated 1= 1/20/01 Linebacker Dexter Coakley, who was expected to miss two weeks due t= o a sprained knee, will likely get the start on Thursday after being out fo= r just one game. He'll help keep Denver's running game in check, but don't = expect his presence to give Dallas' defense added Fantasy value as a whole.=    Emmitt Smith , RB DAL - Bass/Hull Updated 11/20/01 Smith (knee) will sta= rt on Thursday's game against Denver. ""I'm not 100 percent, but I'm healthy=  enough to do my job,"" Smith told the Dallas Morning Star. He'll struggle t= o post solid Fantasy numbers due to Dallas' horrid passing game, so bench h= im this week if at all possible.     Donald Hayes , WR CAR - Martin Updated=  11/20/01 Hayes suffered bruised ribs during Sunday's game against San Fran= cisco. He may miss some practice time this week, but he's expected to play = this weekend against Atlanta. The Falcons secondary is one of the worst in = the league, so Hayes could turn into a good sleeper pick in Week 11.   Terr= y Hardy , TE ARI - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 Hardy is expected to return = to practice this week after missing three games due to shoulder injury. How= ever, he is not certain to play on Sunday against San Diego.

He should roll up some fine numbers agai= nst the Chiefs this week.  Tom Brady , QB NE - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 = The Patriots will stick with Brady for now, and Drew Bledsoe will remain th= e team's No. 2 QB. ""I don't see any changes this week,"" coach B! il! l Beli= chick said. Brady is a solid Fantasy starter right now, but add Bledsoe to = your roster as an insurance policy if you can.  Jonathan Quinn , QB JAC - F= ree Agent Updated 11/20/01 Quinn may have to start in place of Mark Brunell=  (quadriceps) again this week. Brunell's status is still unclear for Sunday= 's game.  Ricky Watters , RB SEA - Rocks Updated 11/20/01 Watters' shoulder=  has not sufficiently healed enough for him to practice, says the Seattle T= imes . He is not expected to return for another two to three weeks, meaning=  Shaun Alexander will continue to be a key performer for many Fantasy teams=  as the postseason comes into view.  Doug Flutie , QB SD - Top Dogs Updated=  11/20/01 Mike Riley told the San Diego Union-Tribune there is no QB contro= versy involving Flutie and rookie Drew Brees. ""Doug is going to be our quar= terback,"" he said. ""You can talk about controversy all you want, but there = is none within this building. He is our quarterback. He will start. He will=  get us the next win the next week."" Still, Flutie is not playing well enou= ght to satisfy most Fantasy owners.  Mark Bruener , TE PIT - Free Agent Upd= ated 11/20/01 Bruener will miss the rest of the season after undergoing sho= ulder injury. His loss may adversely affect Jerome Bettis' statistics, beca= use Bruener is widely regarded as the best run-blocking tight end in footba= ll.  Tyrone Wheatley , RB OAK - Tori Kuykendall Updated 11/20/01 Wheatley t= old the Contra-Costa Times he is no longer being bothered by a knee injury.=  He expects to play on Sunday.  Erron Kinney , TE TEN - Free Agent Updated = 11/20/01! Kinney (calf) may play this week after missing three games. He wa= s expected to return to practice early this week.  Frank Wycheck , TE TEN -=  Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 Wycheck (calf) will be limited in practice thi= s week. He may be a risky start in Week 11.  Steve McNair , QB TEN - Rocks = Updated 11/20/01 The Tennessean says McNair's hand was sore when he arrived=  at the team's practice facility on Monday. Jeff Fisher now says he doesn't=  expect him to miss any practice time this week.   Derrick Alexander , WR K= C - Martin Cuilla Updated 11/20/01 Alexander (ribs) has returned to practic= e. He is expected to start against Seattle.  Marvin Minnis , WR KC - Free A= gent Updated 11/20/01 Minnis (ankle) is listed as doubtful for Sunday's gam= e. Larry Parker may have to start in his place,  Reggie Wayne , WR IND - Fr= ee Agent Updated 11/20/01 ! Wayne has a sprained knee ligament, and is doub= tful for Sunday's game against New Orleans. Terrence Wilkins may have to st= art in his place.  Jerome Pathon , WR IND - Martin Cuilla Updated 11/20/01 = Pathon (foot) is done for the season. He will be put on injured reserve. Re= ggie Wayne (knee) is also hurting, meaning Terrence Wilkins might have to b= e moved back into the starting lineup.   Jay Fiedler , QB MIA - McKay Neal = Updated 11/20/01 Dave Wannstedt told the Miami Herald there is no QB contro= versy surrounding Fielder and backup Ray ri! gh! t now. ``That's kind of hy= pothetical,'' he said. ``Jay is the starter, and my only comment is we're g= oing to get it squared away and play turnover-free football.''  Rod Smith ,=  WR DEN - Baja Updated 11/20/01 Mike Shanahan said he does not know if Smit= h (ankle) will be sufficiently healed to play in Thursday's game against th= e Cowboys. ""We'll get a chance to evaluate that during the week and see,"" S= hanahan told the Denver Post. ""If he can help our football team, he'll play= . If he's in a situation where he can't perform at the level that we think = can help our team, then we'll keep him out and put somebody else in.""   Ben= jamin Gay , RB CLE - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 The Cleveland Plain-Dealer=  says Butch Davis won't indicate how much Gay will play in the near future.=  ""We'll try to get him involved in some of the games,"" Davis said. ""We'll s= ee.""   Kevin Lockett , WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 Lockett, who su= ffered a rib injury last weekend against Denver, expects to play on Sunday = against Philadelphia. However, the wide receiver has no real value as a Fan= tasy player at this point.   Tony Banks , QB WAS - Matt Lenhart Updat! ed! = 11/20/01 Barring any setbacks, Banks will start Sunday's game against Phila= delphia. Banks, who suffered a concussion last weekend vs. Denver, hasn't b= een feeling any after effects of the injury and should be under center for = the 'Skins.   Jacquez Green , WR TB - Hunter Shively Updated 11/20/01 Green=  (abdomen) is expected to return to practice on Wednesday at full strength.=  He's been inconsistent this season, and is best used when the matchup is f= avorable.   Terrell Owens , WR SF - Martin Cuilla Updated 11/20/01 Owens su= ffered a sprained left knee and ankle during the overtime session of last w= eekend's game against Carolina. The injuries aren't considered serious, how= ever, and Owens is expected to be in the starting lineup on Sunday Indianap= olis.   Cecil Martin , RB PHI - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 Martin suffered=  a hamstring injury during Sunday's game against Dallas. He'll miss a few d= ays of practice, but is expected to play in this weekend's game against Was= hington. Martin has no real value as a Fantasy player, but he is a key bloc= ker for Duce Staley.    Giants , DT NYG - Free Agent Upd! at! ed 11/20/01 A= ccording to the New York Post, cornerback Jason Sehorn's surgically-repaire= d right knee began giving him problems again this past weekend. In fact, th= e team was unsure that he'd be able to cover either Randy Moss or Cris Cart= er on Monday night, but he played anyway. If he continues to play on a bad = wheel, you should consider starting any receivers opposing Sehorn the rest = of the season.   Elvis Grbac , QB BAL - Eric Bass Updated 11/20/01 The Balt= imore Sun says there is no indication that Grbac will be replaced as the te= am's starting QB. Still, he is not performing well enough to start for most=  Fantasy teams.  Donald Driver , WR GB - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 Driver=  is still dealing with a thigh injury, and is expected to miss Thursday's g= ame against Detroit. The reserve wideout has no real value as a Fantasy pla= yer at this point.    Ravens , DT BAL - Eric Bass Updated 11/20/01 Defensiv= e end Michael McCrary will miss the rest of the season after undergoing kne= e surgery. His loss will certainly lower the sack output of the Baltimore d= efense and may mean the team will allow more passing yardage than usual.   =  Cowboys , DT DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 Linebacker Dexter Coakley, = who was expected to miss two weeks due to a sprained knee, will likely get = the start on Thursday after being out for just one game. He'll help keep De= nver's running game in check, but don't expect his presence to give Dallas'=  defense added Fantasy value as a whole.   Emmitt Smith , RB DAL - Rocks Up= dated 11/20/01 Smith (knee) will start on Thursday's game against Denver. ""= I'm not 100 percent, but I'm healthy enough to do my job,"" Smith told the D= allas Morning Star . He'll struggle to post solid Fantasy numbers due to Da= llas' horrid passing game, so bench him this week if at all possible.     D= onald Hayes , WR CAR - Eric Bass Updated 11/20/01 Hayes suffered bruised ri= bs during Sunday's game against San Francisco. He may miss some practice ti= me this week, but he's expected to play this weekend against Atlanta. The F= alcons secondary is one of the worst in the league, so Hayes could turn int= o a good sleeper pick in Week 11.   Terry Hardy , TE ARI - Free Agent Updat= ed 11/20/01 Hardy is expected to return t! o! practice this week after miss= ing three games due to shoulder injury. However, he is not certain to play = on Sunday against San Diego.   More Updates  [IMAGE]  Copyright 2001 Commis= sioner.COM Inc and SportsLine.com Inc.

To customi= ze, reschedule, or turn off these reports please  click here    NFL Reports= , Player Updates  [IMAGE]Latest NFL Player News  Tony Martin , WR ATL - Fre= e Agent Updated 11/21/01 Martin hasn't been a reliable Fantasy player at al= l this season, but he could have a decent outing against Carolina. The Pant= hers secondary is one of the worst in the league, so starting Martin in dee= per Fantasy leagues may be worth considering.   Frank Sanders , WR ARI - Fr= ee Agent Updated 11/21/01 Sanders is dealing with two tight hamstrings, but=  he's expected to play on Sunday against San Diego. The Chargers' secondary= ! h! asn't been playing well of late, so giving Sanders some consideration = in deeper leagues is advisable.   David Boston , WR ARI - Bass/Hull Updated=  11/21/01 Boston has become one of the premier wide receivers in Fantasy Fo= otball. He's posted three touchdowns and 217 yards receiving in his last tw= o games, and should have another solid game vs. San Diego in Week 11.   Tom=  Brady , QB NE - Martin Updated 11/21/01 Patriots Head Coach Bill Belichick=  announced late Monday that Brady will remain the starting quarterback for = the remainder of the season, barring injury. This relegates Drew Bledsoe to=  a backup role and makes him useless from a Fantasy perspective. Brady migh= t have his hands full passing against the Saints on Sunday, but he is a fai= rly safe weekly starter otherwise.   Dolphins , DT MIA - Martin Updated 11/= 21/01 Defensive tackle Daryl Gardener could miss the remainder of the seaso= n due to a fragmented disc in his back. He will miss at least one month to = rest and rehabilitate the injury before being re-evaluated. Gardener's abse= nce hurts the Dolphins' rush defense, which might be burned a little more b= y opposing running backs in the upcoming weeks.!   Marvin Minnis , WR KC - = Free Agent Updated 11/21/01 Minnis is unlikely to be available for Sunday's=  game against Seattle due to the sprained ankle he suffered during a Nov. 1= 1 game against the Jets. He will be replaced by Chris Thomas in the lineup = at split end, and you should keep him reserved for this week.  Mark Brunell=  , QB JAC - JWillie Updated 11/21/01 Brunell's nagging leg injury might sid= eline him for Sunday's game against Baltimore. He decided about two hours b= efore last Sunday's kickoff that he couldn't play against Pittsburgh due to=  a strained right quadriceps. Jonathan Quinn has been preparing as if he wi= ll start the game, so right now you shouldn't count on Brunell this week as=  you set your lineups.  Fred Taylor , RB JAC - Martin Updated 11/21/01 Tayl= or received a second medical opinion Tuesday that indicated his severe groi= n injury could keep him out up to three months and possibly the remainder o= f the season, according to the Florida Times-Union. The diagnosis was that = the injury still has not healed and will need more time to become healthy, = and in the meantime Taylor has developed pain! i! n his hip, a side effect = of the injury. It's sounding more and more like Taylor will not play again = this Fantasy season, although you should probably hold onto him until a fin= al decision is reached, provided you have a deep enough bench.  Rod Smith ,=  WR DEN - Matty Updated 11/21/01 Smith's sprained ankle was not healed enou= gh for him to practice on Tuesday, and there is a real chance he might miss=  Thursday's game against Dallas. He suffered the injury Nov. 11, and aggrav= ated it during Sunday's game. You should probably play it safe and keep Smi= th on your bench for this week. Temper your expectations for the entire Bro= ncos' offense as well - the Cowboys' D isn't the pushover many believed it = would be prior to the season.  Shaun Alexander , RB SEA - JWillie Updated 1= 1/20/01 With Ricky Watters expected to miss another two to three weeks, Ale= xander will remain the focal point of many contending Fantasy teams during = their charge to the playoffs. He should roll up some fine numbers against t= he Chiefs this week.  Tom Brady , QB NE - Martin Updated 11/20/01 The Patri= ots will stick with Brady for now, and Drew Bledsoe will remain the team's = No. 2 QB. ""I don't see any changes this week,"" coach Bill Belichick said. B= rady is a solid Fantasy starter right now, but add Bledsoe to you! r ! rost= er as an insurance policy if you can.  Jonathan Quinn , QB JAC - Free Agent=  Updated 11/20/01 Quinn may have to start in place of Mark Brunell (quadric= eps) again this week. Brunell's status is still unclear for Sunday's game. =  Ricky Watters , RB SEA - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 Watters' shoulder has=  not sufficiently healed enough for him to practice, says the Seattle Times=  . He is not expected to return for another two to three weeks, meaning Sha= un Alexander will continue to be a key performer for many Fantasy teams as = the postseason comes into view.  Doug Flutie , QB SD - Russell Updated 11/2= 0/01 Mike Riley told the San Diego Union-Tribune there is no QB controversy=  involving Flutie and rookie Drew Brees. ""Doug is going to be our quarterba= ck,"" he said. ""You can talk about controversy all you want, but there is no= ne within this building. He is our quarterback. He will start. He will get = us the next win the next week."" Still, Flutie is not playing well enought t= o satisfy most Fantasy owners.  Mark Bruener , TE PIT - Free Agent Updated = 11/20/01 Bruener will miss the rest of the season after undergoing shoulder=  injury. His loss may adversely affect Jerome Bettis' statistics, because B= ruener is widely regarded as the best run-blocking tight end in football.  = Tyrone Wheatley , RB OAK - Giggles Updated 11/20/01 Wheatley told the Contr= a-Costa Times he is no longer being bothered by a knee injury. He expects t= o play on Sunday.  Erron Kinney , TE TEN - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 Kinn= ey (calf) may play this week after missing three games. He was expected to = return to practice early this week.  Frank Wycheck , TE TEN - Matty Updated=  11/20/01 Wycheck (calf) will be limited in practice this week. He may be a=  risky start in Week 11.  Steve McNair , QB TEN - Free Agent Updated 11/20/= 01 The Tennessean says McNair's hand was sore when he arrived at the team's=  practice facility on Monday. Jeff Fisher now says he doesn't expect him to=  miss any practice time this week.   Derrick Alexander , WR KC - JWillie Up= dated 11/20/01 Alexander (ribs) has returned to practice. He is expected to=  start against Seattle.  Marvin Minnis , WR KC - Free Agent Updated 11/20/0= 1 Minnis (ankle) is listed as doubtful for Sunday's game. Larry Parker may = have to start in his place,  Reggie Wayne , WR IND - Free Agent Updated 11/= 20/01 Wayne has a sprained knee ligament, and is doubtful for Sunday's game=  against New Orleans. Terrence Wilkins may have to start in his place.  Jer= ome Pathon , WR IND - Tori Updated 11/20/01 Pathon (foot) is done for the s= eason. He will be put on injured reserve. Reggie Wayne (knee) is also hurti= ng, meaning Terrence Wilkins might have to be moved back into the starting = lineup.   Jay Fiedler , QB MIA - Tori Updated 11/20/01 Dave Wannstedt told = the Miami Herald there is no QB controversy surrounding Fielder and backup = Ra! y ! right now. ``That's kind of hypothetical,'' he said. ``Jay is the s= tarter, and my only comment is we're going to get it squared away and play = turnover-free football.''  Rod Smith , WR DEN - Matty Updated 11/20/01 Mike=  Shanahan said he does not know if Smith (ankle) will be sufficiently heale= d to play in Thursday's game against the Cowboys. ""We'll get a chance to ev= aluate that during the week and see,"" Shanahan told the Denver Post. ""If he=  can help our football team, he'll play. If he's in a situation where he ca= n't perform at the level that we think can help our team, then we'll keep h= im out and put somebody else in.""   Benjamin Gay , RB CLE - Free Agent Upda= ted 11/20/01 The Cleveland Plain-Dealer says Butch Davis won't indicate how=  much Gay will play in the near future. ""We'll try to get him involved in s= ome of the games,"" Davis said. ""We'll see.""   Kevin Lockett , WR WAS - Free=  Agent Updated 11/20/01 Lockett, who suffered a rib injury last weekend aga= inst Denver, expects to play on Sunday against Philadelphia. However, the w= ide receiver has no real value as a Fantasy player at this point.   Tony Ba= nks , QB WAS - Free Agent U! pd! ated 11/20/01 Barring any setbacks, Banks = will start Sunday's game against Philadelphia. Banks, who suffered a concus= sion last weekend vs. Denver, hasn't been feeling any after effects of the = injury and should be under center for the 'Skins.   Jacquez Green , WR TB -=  Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 Green (abdomen) is expected to return to pract= ice on Wednesday at full strength. He's been inconsistent this season, and = is best used when the matchup is favorable.   Terrell Owens , WR SF - Marti= n Updated 11/20/01 Owens suffered a sprained left knee and ankle during the=  overtime session of last weekend's game against Carolina. The injuries are= n't considered serious, however, and Owens is expected to be in the startin= g lineup on Sunday Indianapolis.

To customi= ze, reschedule, or turn off these reports please  click here    NFL Reports= , Player Updates  [IMAGE]Latest NFL Player News  Olandis Gary , RB DEN - Fr= ee Agent Updated 11/21/01 Gary will likely get a fair number of carries Thu= rsday against Dallas, but we don't expect him to provide useful Fantasy sta= ts. The Cowboys will probably focus on the run, which makes both Gary and M= ike Anderson risky starts this week since they have been splitting time.  B= rian Griese , QB DEN - Fear Updated 11/21/01 With favorite target Rod Smith=  likely sidelined by injury, Griese will have questionable receivers to wor= k w! it! h Thursday against Dallas. However, the Cowboys' defense will prob= ably focus on the run and force Griese to beat them through the air. He sho= uld provide your team with decent stats and is worth using this week.  Mars= hall Faulk , RB STL - McKay Neal Updated 11/21/01 Faulk had 153 scrimmage y= ards and a touchdown against New England last weekend. He's the best player=  in Fantasy Football, and is a must-start in any league format.   Jamel Whi= te , RB CLE - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01 The Browns may use White as a cha= nge-of-pace back Sunday against the subpar Bengals run defense. You might w= ant to consider him as a third running back option on your team if you're l= acking in starting options.  Ernie Conwell , TE STL - Free Agent Updated 11= /21/01 Conwell has had a few down weeks, so starting him on your Fantasy te= am is somewhat of a gamble. With the lack of depth at tight end around the = league, however, starting Conwell is something many Fantasy owners will hav= e no choice but to do.   Kurt Warner , QB STL - Baja Updated 11/21/01 Warne= r had a solid game against New England last Sunday, throwing for 401 yards = and three touchdowns. He's too good to ever consider benching, and will thr= ow at least two touchdowns against Tampa Bay's inconsistent secondary.   O.= J. Santiago , TE CLE - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01 Santiago catches the occ= asional pass for the Browns and could find the end zone every now or then. = He's going up against a mediocre Cincinnati secondary, so maybe this is one=  of the rare weeks he scores. Only use Santiago if you're desperate for a t= ight end, however, as he rarely gets a big yardage total.  Kevin Johnson  ,=  WR CLE - Top Dogs Updated 11/21/01 Johnson has been a prime target for Tim=  Couch in the Cleveland passing game this season, and is now a very reliabl= e No. 2 or 3 Fantasy receiver. Johnson is on a real hot streak and has a go= od career record against the Bengals, his opponent for this week, so get hi= m into your lineup.  Tim Couch , QB CLE - Rocks Updated 11/21/01 Couch has = a decent track record against the Bengals (453 passing yards, four TDs), wh= om he will face on Sunday. There are plenty worse quarterbacks you could ch= oose from, so if you're reaching to find a starter this week, give him a lo= ok.  Peter Warrick , WR CIN - Top Dogs Updated 11/21/01 Warrick has been ca= tching a fair amount of passes this season, but hasn't provided stats worth= y of using him on a weekly basis in a Fantasy league. His matchup against C= leveland on Sunday is unfavorable, so keep him reserved this week.  Darnay = Scott , WR CIN - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01 Although Scott has caught a to= uchdown pass in each of his last two games against the Browns, whom he play= s Sunday, we can't recommend you use him this week. He has been far too inc= onsistent and a real disappointment from a Fantasy perspective.  Jon Kitna = , QB CIN - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01 We can't advise you use Kitna as he = goes up against the Browns' secondary this week. Cleveland has been very st= ingy against the pass all year, leading the league in interceptions and ran= king ninth overall in sacks.  Corey Dillon , RB CIN - Matt Lenhart Updated = 11/21/01 Definitely get Dillon into your active lineup as he goes up agains= t the Browns on Sunday. He has a great career record against Cleveland (678=  rushing yards, five rushing TDs in five games). Dillon should remain in yo= ur active lineup week in and week ! ou! t in any league.  Larry Centers , R= B BUF - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01 Centers has been a great pass-catching = back for the Bills this season, but he will face a Miami defense on Sunday = that will likely be able to contain him. Only use him if you have no other = alternative on your bench.  Peerless Price , WR BUF - Matt Lenhart Updated = 11/21/01 Price has established himself as a solid Fantasy receiver in recen= t weeks, logging 100-plus yards in three of his last six games. He faces a = bigger challenge in Miami on Sunday, but right now you can't merit reservin= g him.  Eric Moulds , WR BUF - Matt Lenhart Updated 11/21/01 There's a good=  chance that Moulds will be inspired to have a good week against a solid Mi= ami secondary after he voiced disapproval at his recent limited role in the=  Buffalo passing game. Pair that with the fact that he has a good history a= gainst the Dolphins (four TDs in last six games), and he might be worth usi= ng as a No. 2 or 3 receiver this week.  Eric Johnson , TE SF - Free Agent U= pdated 11/21/01 Johnson caught three passes for 34 yards last weekend again= st Carolina. Unless you play in a deeper Fantasy league, Johnson isn't real= ly worth starting at this point.    J.J. Stokes , WR SF - Free Agent Update= d 11/21/01 Stokes had a solid game last weekend, catching eight passes for = 72 yards and two touchdowns against Carolina. He's been very unreliable ove= rall, however, so starting him is still a risky move.   Travis Henry , RB B= UF - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01 Henry had a very disappointing game agains= t the Seahawks in Week 10, and will likely struggle again against the far-b= etter Dolphins defense on Sunday. He has been far too inconsistent to merit=  using this week.  Alex Van Pelt , QB BUF - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01 Van=  Pelt is a very risky start on Sunday, as he is going up against a strong D= olphins secondary. He had a good start last week against the subpar Seahawk= s, but we don't forecast him helping carry your team to victory this week d= espite several injuries to the Miami defense. Keep Van Pelt on the bench fo= r Week 11.  ! Travis Taylor , WR BAL - Hunter Shively Updated 11/21/01 Afte= r a few solid weeks, Taylor has returned to his old unproductive self. We d= on't expect him to post great stats Sunday against the Jaguars, so don't us= e him this week.  Shannon Sharpe , TE BAL - Rocks Updated 11/21/01 Sharpe h= as been a very reliable tight end despite having just one receiving touchdo= wn on the season. He got seven catches the last time he faced Jacksonville,=  and should get several in their Week 11 matchup. Get Sharpe into your acti= ve lineup every week.  Qadry Ismail, WR BAL - McKay Neal Updated 11/21/01Is= mail has become the Ravens' lead receiver this season, and is quickly devel= oping into a very reliable No. 2 Fantasy wideout. He is on a real hot strea= k and has a good history against the Jaguars' secondary. Make sure you get = Ismail into your starting lineup this week. Correll Buckhalter , RB PHI - F= ree Agent Updated 11/21/01 Buckhalter will return from suspension this week= end, and will be available for Sunday's game against Washington. Duce Stale= y has established himself as the Eagles' featured back, so starting Buckhal= ter is a gamble.   Duce Staley , RB PHI - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01 Stale= y had a solid game against Dallas, posting 133 scrimmage yards in Philadelp= hia's 36-3 win. He's been on a roll in recent weeks, which makes him worth = starting in Week 11 against Washington.   James Thrash , WR PHI - Free Agen= t Updated 11/21/01 Just when you think Thrash is reliable, he puts up two c= atches for 17 yards like he did last weekend against Dallas. Thrash will st= ill be in the starting lineups of numberous Fantasy teams, but he's a gambl= e nonetheless.   Ron Dayne  , RB NYG - Martin Cuilla Updated 11/21/01 Dayne=  has been a serious disappointment for Fantasy owners in recent weeks. He m= ay score a touchdown in goal-line situations, but he's a risky pick for Fan= tasy owners overall.      Tiki Barber , RB NYG - The Klap Updated 11/21/01 = Barber has played well recently, compiling 233 scrimmage yards and a touchd= own in his last two games. Oakland has been vulnerable to the run this seas= on, so look for the Giants to use Barber prominently in their offense in We= ek 11.   Ike Hilliard , WR NYG - Tori Kuykendall! Updated 11/21/01 Hilliard=  continues to be a reliable Fantasy player despite playing on a sore toe. H= e may have a tough time against Oakland's formidable secondary, however, es= pecially if Charles Woodson is healthy enough to play.   Amani Toomer , WR = NYG - McKay Neal Updated 11/21/01 Toomer caught five balls for 60 yards aga= inst Minnesota on Monday night, but he'll struggle to post similar numbers = vs. Oakland. The Raiders have a formidable secondary, so benching Toomer in=  smaller Fantasy leagues is a wise move.

Despite his good outing, Mack remains a Fantasy risk be= ! ca! use of his inconsistency.   Qadry Ismail , WR BAL - Bass/Hull Updated=  11/25/01 The Jaguars held Ismail to three catches for 44 yards. Despite hi= s quiet statistical performance, Ismail remains a must-start player for any=  Fantasy team. He is one of the most complete and underrated receivers in t= he AFC.  Jason Brookins , RB BAL - Tori Updated 11/25/01 Brookins rushed fo= r 82 yards and two TDs at Jacksonville, but also lost a fumble. The rookie = RB is talented, but too erratic to be a Fantasy starter on most teams right=  now. Ron Dayne , RB NYG - Neal/McKay Updated 11/25/01 Dayne carried the ba= ll six times for 26 yards against Oakland. Don't depend on him for good num= bers during the remainder of the season.  Tiki Barber , RB NYG - Neal/McKay=  Updated 11/25/01 Barber rushed for 124 yards and a TD against Oakland, and=  caught five passes for 41 yards. He has played well recently, although his=  owners would still like to see him score on a more consistent basis.  LaDa= inian Tomlinson , RB SD - Hunter Updated 11/25/01 Tomlinson was held out of=  the end zone, but he had a good day against Arizona nonetheless. The rooki= e tailback had 145 scrimmage yards, including 13 receptions, in San Diego's=  20-17 loss.   Doug Flutie , QB SD - Russell Updated 11/25/01 Flutie had a = solid game, throwing for 308 yards and two touchdowns against Arizona. Howe= ver, he's only worth starting when the matchup is to his advantage.   Jake = Plummer , QB ARI - Frank Updated 11/25/01 Plummer had a decent outing on Su= nday, posting 241 yards and a touchdown against San Diego. Plummer, who als= o threw two picks, is only a reserve Fantasy quarterback at best.   David B= oston , WR ARI - Bass/Hull Updated 11/25/01 Boston had another outstanding = game, catching six passes for 121 yards and a touchdown against San Diego. = He's one of the most reliable Fantasy receivers in the league, and is worth=  starting on a weekly basis.   Willie Jackson , WR NO - Martin Updated 11/2= 5/01 Jackson had ! a ! good outing against New England, catching five catch= es for 78 yards and a touchdown. He may not be the most dependable Fantasy = receiver, but he is worth starting in deeper leagues.   Joe Horn , WR NO - = Matty Updated 11/25/01 Horn had another solid outing, catching four passes = for 97 yards against New England. He's been a very dependable receiver in r= ecent weeks and is worth starting on a weekly basis.  Tyrone Wheatley , RB = OAK - Giggles Updated 11/25/01 In his return from a knee injury, Wheatley c= arried the ball five times for 17 yards. Zack Crockett was used more often = in short-yardage packages, and Wheatley does not appear capable of starting=  for any Fantasy team in the near future. Even when he is fully healthy, he=  may not be able to take many carries away from Charlie Garner.  Antowain S= mith , RB NE - JWillie Updated 11/25/01 Smith had 153 yards of total offens= e and two touchdowns against New Orleans. After a slow start, Smith has bec= ome a pretty good weekly option for Fantasy Footballers  Tom Brady , QB NE = - Martin Updated 11/25/01 Brady put up huge numbers against New Orleans, po= sting 258 yards passing and four touchdowns. He's become a pretty reliable = Fantasy player, and his performance will likely keep Drew Bledsoe on the Pa= triots' bench for another week.  Rich Gannon , QB OAK - Martin Updated 11/2= 5/01 Gannon threw for 221 yards, three TDs and no interceptions against the=  Giants. He ignored rain-soaked conditions, and continued to look like the = most reliable QB in Fantasy Football.  Frank Sanders , WR ARI - Free Agent = Updated 11/25/01 Sanders left Sunday's game against San Diego after re-aggr= avating a hamstring injury. He was replaced by MarTay Jenkins, and did not = return to the game.  Eric Moulds , WR BUF - Bass/Hull Updated 11/25/01 Moul= ds finally emerged from an extended slump, catching six passes for 196 yard= s and two TDs against Miami. He also lost a fumble, and Fantasy owners shou= ld still remember that Moulds has been a disappointment for most of the yea= r. Don't be surprised if he follows his best outing of the year with a medi= ocre performance.  Alex Van Pelt , QB BUF - Free Agent Updated 11/25/01 Van=  Pelt had another fine game, throwing for 309 yards, three TDs and one inte= rception. He is definitely merits strong Fantasy consideration as long as h= e remains in Buffalo's starting lineup.  Oronde Gadsden , WR MIA - Matty Up= dated 11/25/01 Gadsden caught eight passes for 118 yards at Buffalo. He did=  not catch a TD pass, though, and lost a fumble. Gadsden is too unreliable = to start for most Fantasy teams in these important final weeks.  Jay Fiedle= r , QB MIA - Tori Updated 11/25/01 Fiedler threw for 262 yards, three TDs a= nd no interceptions at Buffalo. His performance may have quieted talk of a = QB controversy, but Fiedler is still too inconsistent to be a dependable Fa= ntasy QB.  Donovan McNabb , QB PHI - Russell Updated 11/25/01 The Redskins = held McNabb to 92 passing yards and 39 rushing yards, with no TDs or interc= eptions. Expect the Philadelphia QB to rebound quickly from such a quiet pe= rformance.  James Thrash , WR PHI - Frank Updated 11/25/01 Thrash caught fo= ur passes for 32 yards against Washington. He is too ! in! consistent to be=  a starter on better Fantasy teams as the playoffs approach.   Rod Gardner = , WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/25/01 Gardner caught four passes for only = 33 yards on Sunday. The rookie has slowed down considerably in the past few=  weeks, and now seems like a risk during the Fantasy homestretch.   Ki-Jana=  Carter , RB WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/25/01 Carter saw extensive action = on Sunday as Stephen Davis played through back problems. He carried 18 time= s for 56 yards, and is a good backup to have if Davis in on your Fantasy te= am. Davis has always been known to battle minor injuries.  Isaac Byrd , WR = CAR - Free Agent Updated 11/25/01 Byrd started in place of the injured Muhs= in Muhammad on Sunday. He posted decent Fantasy numbers in Muhammad's absen= ce, catching five passes for 69 yards in Carolina's 10-7 loss to Atlanta.  =  Muhsin Muhammad , WR CAR - Martin Updated 11/25/01 Muhammad missed! S! und= ay's game against Atlanta due to a shoulder injury. His status for next wee= kend's game against New Orleans is unknown at this time.   Derrick Alexande= r , WR KC - JWillie Updated 11/25/01 Alexander caught two passes for 56 yar= ds in his return from a rib injury. He was not open often, and Alexander ma= y continue to be a Fantasy disappointment if he stays healthy.  Chris Chand= ler , QB ATL - Free Agent Updated 11/25/01 Chandler had a subpar game on Su= nday, throwing for only 132 yards against Carolina. The Falcons chose to at= tack Carolina with their ground game, which was the reason for Chandler's p= oor Fantasy numbers.   Derrick Alexander , WR KC - JWillie Updated 11/25/01=  Alexander caught two passes for 56 yards in his return from a rib injury. = He was not open often, and Alexander may continue to be a Fantasy disappoin= tment if he stays healthy.

Rod Gardner , W= R WAS - Not So Nice Machine Updated 11/25/01 Gardner caught four passes for=  only 33 yards on Sunday. The rookie has slowed down considerably in the pa= st few weeks, and now seems like a risk during the Fantasy homestretch.

If you dont like this email, then you just don't understand.    A chronology of events for Saturday,  December 4, 1999, and the early morning hours of Sunday, December 5, 1999: 6:00 Arise, play the Eyes of Texas and Texas Fight at full-freaking blast 6:20 Get in car, drive to New Braunfels  7:30 Tee off (me and a buddy were the FIRST tee-time of the morning) 8:50 Turn 9 (crack open first beer) 8:53 Crack open second beer 8:58 Crack open...(you get the idea) 10:30 Finish 18 (holes, as well as beers), sign scorecard for smoooooth 95 10:35 Headed for San Antonio 10:50 Buy three 18-packs for pre- and post-game festivities 11:10 We decide we don't have enough booze, so we double-back to a liquor store and buy the good ol' 750 ml plastic bottle ""Traveler"" Jim Beam 11:50 Arrive at the tailgate spot. Awesome day. Not a single cloud in the sky. About 70 degrees. 11:55 I decide that we're going to kick the shit out of Nebraska. 11:56 I tell my first Nebraska fan to go fuck himself. 12:15 The UT band walks by on the way to the Alamodome. We're on the second floor of a two-story parking garage on the corner (a couple hundred of us). We're hooting and hollering like wildmen. The band doubles back to the street right below us and serenades us with Texas Fight and The Eyes of Texas. AWESOME MOMENT. 12:25 In the post-serenade serendipity, 50-100 grown men are bumping chests with one another, each and every one of them now secure and certain of the fact that we are going to kick the shit out of Nebraska. 1:00 The Nebraska band walks by on the way to the Alamodome. Again, we hoot and holler like wildmen. Again, the band doubles back and stops right below us to serenade us, this time, however, with the Nebraska fight songs. Although somewhat impressed by their spirit and verve, we remain convinced that we are going to kick the shit out of Nebraska. 1:30 I begin the walk to the Alamodome, somehow managing to stuff the ""Traveler"" and 11 cans of beer into my pants. 1:47 I am in line surrounded by Nebraska fans. They are taunting me. I am taunting back, still certain that we are going to kick the shit out of Nebraska. I decide to challenge a particularly vocal Nebraska fan to play what I now call and will forever be remembered as ""Cell-Phone Flop Out."" Remember flop out for a dollar? The rules are similar. I tell this Nebraska jackass that if he's so confident in his team, he should ""flop out"" his cell phone RIGHT NOW and make plane reservations to Phoenix for the Fiesta Bowl. And then I spoke these memorable words: ""And not those damn refundable tickets, either! You request those non-refundable, non-transferrable sons-of-bitches!"" He backs down. He is unworthy. I call Southwest Airlines and buy two tickets to Phoenix, non-refundable and non-transferrable. Price: $712. He is humbled. He lowers his head in shame. I raise my cell phone in triumph to the cheers of hundreds of Texas fans. I am KING and these are my subjects. I distribute the 11 beers in my pants to the cheering masses. I RULE the pre-game kingdom. 2:34 Kickoff. Brimming with confidence, I open the Traveler and pour my first stiffy. 2:45 I notice something troubling: Nebraska is big. Nebraska is fast. Nebraska is very pissed off at Texas. 3:01 The first quarter mercifully ends. 9 yards total offense for Texas. Zero first downs for Texas. I'm still talking shit. I pour another stiffy from the Traveler. 3:36 Four minutes to go in the first half: the Traveler is a dead soldier. I buy my first $5 beer from the Alamodome merchants. While I am standing in line, a center snap nearly decapitates Major Applewhite and rolls out of the end zone. Safety. 3:56 Halftime score: Nebraska 15, Texas 0. I wish I had another Traveler. 4:11 While urinating next to a Nebraska fan in the bathroom at halftime, I attempt to revive the classic Brice-ism from the South Bend bathroom: ""Hey, buddy, niiiiiiiiice cock."" He is unamused. 4:21 I buy my 2nd and 3rd $5 beer from the Alamodome merchants. I share my beer with two high school girls sitting behind me. Surprisingly, they are equipped with a flask full of vodka. I send them off to purchase $5 Sprites, so that we may consume their vodka. I have not lost faith. Nebraska is a bunch of pussies. 4:51 No more vodka. The girls sitting behind me have fled for their lives. I purchase two more $5 beers from the Alamodome merchants. 5:18 Score is Nebraska 22, Texas 0. I am beginning to lose faith. This normally would trouble me, but I am too drunk to see the football field.  5:27 I call Southwest Airlines: ""I'm sorry, sir. Those tickets have been confirmed and are non-refundable and non-transferrable."" 5:37 I try to start a fight with every person behind the concession counter. As it turns out, the Alamodome has a policy that no beer can be sold when there is less than 10 minutes on the game clock. I am enraged by this policy. I ask loudly: ""Why the fuck didn't you announce last call over the fucking PA system??!!"" 5:49 Back in my seats, I am slumped in my chair in defeat. All of a sudden, the Texas crowd goes absolutely nuts. ""Whazzis?,"" I mutter, awaking from my coma, ""Iz we winnig? Did wez scort?"" Alas, the answer is no, we were not winning and we did not score. The largest (by far) cheer of the day from the Texas faithful occurred when the handlers were walking back to the tunnel and Bevo stopped to take a gargantuan shit all over the letters ""S"", ""K"", and ""A"" in the ""Nebraska"" spelled out in their end zone. I cheer wildly. I pick up the empty Traveler bottle and stick my tongue in it. I am thirsty. 6:16 Nebraska fans are going berserk as I walk back to the truck. I would taunt them with some off-color remarks about their parentage, but I am too drunk to form complete sentences. With my last cognitive thought of the evening, I take solace in the fact that if we had not beaten them in October, they would be playing Florida State for the national championship. 6:30 Back in the car. On the way back to Austin for the 8:00 Texas-Arizona tip off. We can still salvage the day! I crack open a beer. It is warm. I don't care. 7:12 We have stopped for gas. I am hungry. I go inside the store. I walk past the beer frig. I notice a Zima. I've never had a Zima. I wonder if it's any good. I pull a Zima from the frig. I twist the top off and drink the Zima in three swallows. Zima sucks. I replace the empty bottle in the frig. 7:17 There is a Blimpie Subs in the store. I walk to where the ingredients are, where the person usually makes the sub. There is no one there. I lean over the counter and scoop out half a bucket of black olives. I eat them. I am still hungry. I lean further over the counter and grab approximately two pounds of Pastrami. I walk out of the store grunting and eating Pastrami. The patrons in the store fear me. I don't care. 8:01 We are in South Austin. I have been drinking warm beer and singing Brooks and Dunn tunes for over an hour. My truck-mate is tired of my singing. He suggests that perhaps Brooks and Dunn have written other good songs besides ""You're Going to Miss Me When I'm Gone"" and ""Neon Moon"" and that maybe listening to only those two songs, ten times each was a bit excessive. Perhaps, he suggests, I could just let the CD play on its own. I tell him to fuck off and restart ""Neon Moon."" 8:30 We arrive at the Erwin Center. My truckmate, against my loud and profane protestations, parks on the top floor of a nearby parking garage. I tell him he's an idiot. I tell him we will never get out. I tell him we may as well pitch a fucking tent here. He ignores me. I think he's still pissed about the Brooks and Dunn tunes. I whistle ""Neon Moon"" loudly. 8:47 I am rallying. I have 4 warm beers stuffed in my pants. We're going to kick the shit out of Arizona. 9:11 Halftime score: Texas 31, Arizona 29. I am pleased. I go to the bathroom to pee for the 67th time today. I giggle to myself because of the new opportunity to do ""the bathroom Brice."" There are no Arizona fans in the bathroom. I am disappointed. I tell myself (out loud) that I have a ""Niiiiiice cock."" No one is amused but me. 9:41 I walk to the bathroom while drinking Bud Light out of a can. Needless to say, they do not sell beer at the Erwin Center, much less Bud Light out of a can. I am stopped by an usher: ""Where did you get that, sir?"" I tell him (no shit): ""Oh, the cheerleaders were throwing them up with those little plastic footballs. Would you mind throwing this away for me?"" I take the last swig and hand it to him. He is confused. I pretend I'm going to the bathroom, but I run away giggling instead. I duck into some entrance to avoid the usher, who is now pursuing me. I sneak into a large group of people and sit down. The usher walks by harmlessly. I am giggling like a little girl. I crack open another can of Bud Light. 9:52 I am lost. In my haste to avoid the usher, I have lost my bearings. I have no ticket stub. I cannot find my seats. Texas is losing. 10:09 Texas is being screwed by the refs. I am enraged. I have cleared out the seats around me because I keep removing my hat and beating the surrounding chairs with it. A concerned fan asks if I'm OK and perhaps I shouldn't take it so seriously. I tell him to fuck off. 10:15 After the fourth consecutive ""worst fucking call I have EVER seen,"" I attempt to remove my hat again to begin beating inanimate objects. However, on this occasion I miscalculate and I thumbnail myself in my left eyelid, leaving a one-quarter inch gash over my eye. I am now bleeding into my left eye and all over my shirt. ""Perhaps,"" I think to myself, ""I'm taking this a bit seriously."" 10:22 I am standing in the bathroom peeing. I'm so drunk I am swaying and grunting. I have a bloody napkin pressed on my left eye. My pants are bloody. I have my (formerly) white shirt wrapped around my waist. I look like I should be in an episode of Cops. 10:43 Texas has lost. I put my bloody white shirt back on my body and make my way for the exits. I am stopped every 20 seconds by a good samaritan/cop/security guard to ask me why I am covered in blood, but I merely grunt incoherently and keep moving. 10:59 With my one good eye, I have located the parking garage. I walk up six flights of stairs, promise that when I see my friend I will punch him in the face for making me walk up six flights of stairs, find the truck, and collapse in a heap in the bed of the truck. I look around and notice that traffic is lined up all the way around the garage, six whole flights, and no one is moving. I take a nap. 11:17 I awake from my nap. I see my friend in the driver's seat. I lift my head to look out the bed of the truck and notice that traffic is lined up all the way around the garage, six whole flights, and no one is moving. I am too tired to punch my friend. I call my friend a ""Stupid fuck."" 11:31 I lift my head to look out the bed of the truck and notice that traffic is lined up all the way around the garage, six whole flights, and no one is moving. I call my friend a ""Stupid fuck.""  11:38 I lift my head to look out the bed of the truck and notice that traffic is lined up all the way around the garage, six whole flights, and no one is moving. I call my friend a ""Stupid fuck.""  11:47 I lift my head to look out the bed of the truck and notice that traffic is lined up all the way around the garage, six whole flights, and no one is moving. I call my friend a ""Stupid fuck.""  11:58 I am jostled. The truck is moving. I lift my head to look out the bed of the truck and notice that traffic is beginning to move on the second floor. I jump out of the truck, walk to the edge of the parking facility, and pee off the sixth floor onto the street below. My friend looks at me like I just anally violated his minor sister. I turn around and pee on the front of his truck while singing the lyrics to ""Neon Moon."" 12:11 We are moving. We are out of beer. I jump from the truck and go from vehicle to vehicle until someone gives me two beers. I am happy. I return to my vehicle. 12:26 We have emerged from the parking facility. We make our way to my apartment and find Ed sitting on the couch with a freshly opened bottle of Glenlivet on the coffee table in front of him. We are all going to die tonight. 12:59 We have finished three-quarters of the bottle of Glenlivet. We decide it would be a wonderful idea to go dancing at PollyEsther's. Ed has to pee. He walks down the hall to our apartment and directly into the full length mirror at the end of the hall, smashing it into hundreds of pieces. We giggle uncontrollably and leave for PollyEsther's. 1:17 The PollyEsther's doorman laughs uncontrollably at our efforts to enter his club. ""Fellas,"" he says in between his fits of spastic laughter, ""I've been working this door for almost a year. I've been working doors in this town for almost 5 years. And I can honestly say that I ain't never seen three drunker mother fuckers than you three. Sorry, can't let you in."" We attempt to reason with him. He laughs harder. 1:44 We find a bar that lets us in. We take two steps in the door and hear ""Last call for alcohol!"" I turn to the group and mutter: ""See, dat wasn't that fuckin' hard. Day don't fuckin' do that at the Awamo...the awaom...the alab...fuck it, that stadium we was at today..."" We order 6 shots of tequila and three beers. 2:15 Back on the street. We need food. We hail a cab to take us the two and one half blocks to Katz's. The cab fare is $1.60. We give him $10 and tell him to keep it. 2:17 There is a 20 minute wait. We give the hostess $50. We are seated immediately. 2:25 We order two orders of fried pickles, a Cobb salad, a bowl of soup, two orders of Blueberry blintzes, two Reuben sandwiches, a hamburger, two cheese stuffed potatoes, an order of fries, and an order of onion rings. 2:39 The food arrives. We are all asleep with our heads on the table. The waiter wakes us up. We eat every fucking bit of our food. Most of the restaurant patrons around us are disgusted. We don't give a shit. The tab is $112 with tip. 2:46 I'm sleepy. 9:12 I wake up next to a strange woman. She is the bartender at Katz's. She is not pretty.","mena.'luis@enron.com, eric.bass@enron.com, harrington.john@enron.com,   jones.ryan@enron.com, lobo.franklin@enron.com,   bauer.jennifer@enron.com, lyday.glenn@enron.com",matthew.lenhart@enron.com,RE: [Fwd: a day in the life],2001-11-27 14:54:51-08:00,sent

He w= ill be limited again in practice, and it's probably a good idea to keep him=  on reserve for Week 12 in your league.  Terrell Davis , RB DEN - JWillie U= pdated 11/27/01 Davis should be able to return from arthroscopic knee surge= ry in time for Sunday's game agai! ns! t Miami. He will practice this week = before a final decision is made, but we're skeptical the Broncos won't have=  him split carries with Mike Anderson, limiting both players' Fantasy value= s.  Keith Poole , WR DEN - Free Agent Updated 11/27/01 Poole has bruised ri= bs that will likely keep him on the sidelines for Sunday's game against Mia= mi. If he can't play, Kevin Kaspar would start in his place, and the Denver=  passing game would further suffer.  Rod Smith , WR DEN - Matty Updated 11/= 27/01 Smith now has two sprained ankles, and is questionable for Sunday's g= ame against Miami. If he can't play, then the Broncos might have to start K= evin Kaspar and Chris Cole at wideout, depending on Keith Poole's recovery = from a rib injury.  James Jackson , RB CLE - Hunter Updated 11/27/01 Jackso= n's ankle remains sore, and he will be re-evaluated Wednesday to determine = his status for Sunday's game against Tennessee. Benjamin Gay and Jamel Whit= e would continue to split carries if Jackson can't go.  Neil Rackers , K CI= N - Free Agent Updated 11/27/01 Bengals Head Coach Dick LeBeau said Monday = he has not yet made a decision on the status of Rackers, who missed two fie= ld-goal chances Sunday. He is 9-for-18 in field goals this season, and Jare= t Holmes has been on the practice squad since Nov. 1. Rackers will likely r= etain the job for Sunday's game against Tampa Bay, but he's a very risky Fa= ntasy starter based on his struggles.  Akili Smith , QB CIN - Free Agent Up= dated 11/27/01 Bengals Head Coach Dick LeBeau said Monday that Smith might = be promoted to No. 2 quarterback, according to The Cincinnati Enquirer . ""I= f that's what they're going to do, maybe the Bengals need to get rid of me,= "" Smith said, citing a desire to be traded if he's used in a mop-up role. H= e's not a recommended Fantasy choice, although it's important to note that = he's now likely next in line if Jon Kitna gets hurt.  Terry Allen , RB BAL = - Tori Updated 11/27/01 Allen, who remains out with a broken hand, could re= turn to the lineup on Dec. 16. With the Ravens losing Jason Brookins to an = injury, don't be surprised if Allen takes back the starting job once health= y. Hold onto him if you have the room on your reserve list or play in a dee= per league.  ! Moe Williams , RB BAL - Free Agent Updated 11/27/01 Williams=  becomes the Ravens' featured back after the injury to Jason Brookins. If y= ou play in a deeper league or are desperate for a running back, consider pi= cking up Williams, although you shouldn't expect him to post great stats un= less the matchup is very favorable.  Jason Brookins , RB BAL - Tori Updated=  11/27/01 Results of X-rays on Brookins' foot revealed a fracture of a bone=  in his small toe, which will sideline him for at least four weeks and poss= ibly the rest of the season. Moe Williams becomes the Ravens' starting runn= ing back, and might be worth adding to your roster in a deeper league.  Way= ne Chrebet , WR NYJ - JWillie Updated 11/27/01 Chrebret did not practice Mo= nday because of a shoulder injury. However, The New York Newsday reports th= at he is expected to play in Sunday's game.   Jake Arians , K BUF - Free Ag= ent Updated 11/27/01 Arians has been released by the Bills. Buffalo has sig= ned Shayne Graham to replace him.   Edgerrin James , RB IND - JWillie Updat= ed 1! 1/! 27/01 Colts coach Jim Mora said James' surgery to repair a torn l= igament in his left knee was successful Saturday in Miami.  Mora said he re= ceived the news from orthopedic surgeon Dr. Arthur Rettig, a team physician= . ""I spoke with him Saturday and he told me it went very well,"" Mora said. = James, the two-time NFL rushing champion, injured the knee when he was tack= led awkwardly late in a game at Kansas City on Oct. 25. He was placed on in= jured reserve last week. James' rehabilitation is expected to take seven mo= nths. He is not expected to take part in either of the Colts offseason mini= camps. Team president Bill Polian has not said whether James will be ready = for the start of training camp.     Terry Glenn , WR NE - Matty Updated 11/= 27/01  Glenn could be put on injured reserve if he doesn't recover from a h= amstring injury soon. That would mean the end of his season, and perhaps th= e end of his Patriots career. ""I haven't reached it yet,"" coach Bill Belich= ick said Monday when asked when he would decide if the roster spot would be=  better spent on someone other than Glenn. ""But as each day goes by, it get= s a little bit closer.""      Shayne Graham , K SEA - Free Agent Updated 11/= 27/01 The Buffalo Bills signed Graham as their kicker Tuesday, a day after = Jake Arians was released following a missed point-after against the Miami D= olphins. Graham had been released by the Seattle Seahawks before the start = of the season.   Stephen Alexander , TE WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/27/01 A= lexander, who has been hampered by a ankle injury, returned to action on Su= nday. He didn't start, however, and may lose playing time to both Walter Ra= sby and Zeron Flemister for the rest of the season. Unless you play in a de= eper league, dropping Alexander is advisable.  Az-Zahir Hakim , WR STL - Ne= al/McKay Updated 11/27/01 Hakim, who is dealing with an ankle injury, playe= d in Monday night's 24-17 loss to Tampa Bay. He had three catches for 29 ya= rds in the game.   Kevan Barlow , RB SF - Tori Updated 11/27/01 Barlow suff= ered a dislocated shoulder during Sunday's win over Indianapolis. ""It's thr= obbing,"" Barlow told the Contra Costa Times. ""I couldn't really sleep last = night. I had to sleep sitting up. It's hurting."" Barlow is listed as doubtf= ul for Sunday's game against Buffalo, so be sure to place him on reserve.  =    Terrell Owens , WR SF - Martin Updated 11/27/01 Owens suffered a spraine= d right foot on Sunday to go along with his sprained left ankle. X-rays wer= e negative, but Owens' foot was placed in a prot! ec! tive boot as a precau= tion. He is expected to miss some practice time this week, but he will be i= n the starting lineup on Sunday when the Niners face Buffalo.   Jeff Thomas= on , TE PHI - Free Agent Updated 11/27/01 Thomason suffered a hyperextended=  knee during Sunday's loss to Washington. He missed practice on Monday, and=  is status for Week 12 is uncertain at this time. The reserve tight end has=  very little value as a Fantasy player.   Donald Driver , WR GB - Free Agen= t Updated 11/27/01 Driver, who has been inactive for three straight weeks d= ue to a thigh injury, returned to practice on Monday. His status for Week 1= 2 remains unclear, but he's not worth starting on your Fantasy team in any = event.   Tyrone Davis , TE GB - Free Agent Updated 11/27/01 Davis, who has = been out all year due to a hamstring injury, will likely find out what his = status with the Packers will be this week. Depending on his health, the tea= m will either activate him, place him on injured reserve or cut him altogeh= ter.   James Stewart , RB DET - Hunter Updated 11/27/01 Stewart, who suffer= ed a neck stinger in last Thursday's game against Green Bay, is expected to=  be available for Week 12. He'll have a tough time posting good Fantasy num= bers against Chicago's tough run defense, but the lack of depth at running = back in the league makes it tough to bench him.   Charlie Batch , QB DET - = Free Agent Updated 11/27/01 According to the Detroit Free Press , Batch is = expected to start Sunday's game against Chicago despite a groin injury. ""Th= is is Charlie's offense,"" coach Marty Mornhinweg said. ""He practiced a litt= le bit today...he was in all weekend getting (the injury) treated...I would=  expect him close to full speed Wednesday."" He'll likely lose snaps to rook= ie QB Mike McMahon, however, so starting Batch is a risky proposition.   Ja= ckie Harris , TE DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/27/01 Harris missed last week'= s game against Denver due to a hamstring injury. The veteran tight end is l= isted as day to day.   Anthony Thomas , RB CHI - Martin Up! da! ted 11/27/0= 1 According to coach Dick Jaroun, Thomas' status for Week 12 is still uncer= tain. In fact, the Bears don't expect to know if Thomas, who is dealing wit= h a hamstring injury, will be available until later in the week.   Brad Hoo= ver , RB CAR - Free Agent Updated 11/27/01 Hoover (neck) will likely be hel= d out of practice this week. However, the Panthers are hopeful that he'll b= e available for Sunday's game against New Orleans.   Chris Weinke , QB CAR = - Tori Updated 11/27/01 Despite his inconsistent play and 14 interceptions,=  Weinke's job as Carolina's No. 1 quarterback is secure. ""There've been qua= rterbacks who have gone on to be very successful that have gone through tim= es like this,"" coach George Seifert told the Charlotte Observer. ""Even thou= gh there are a number of these plays that haven't turned out and there have=  been disruptions in his play, I think, ultimately, it will be more benefic= ial than not."" While he may be the starting quarterback in Carolina, Weinke=  isn't worth a roster spot in most Fantasy leagues.   Frank Sanders , WR AR= I - Free Agent Updated 11/27/01 Sanders, who left Sunday's game against San=  Diego due to nagging hamstring injuries, is questionable for the Cards' We= ek 12 matchup at Oakland. However! , ! he is optimistic that he'll be avail= able for the game. ""I'll be there,"" Sanders told the Arizona Republic. ""The= y're just real sore from doing a lot of running and jumping - normal wear a= nd tear."" In any event, keeping Sanders on your bench may be a good idea ag= ainst the tough Oakland secondary.   Rob Moore , WR ARI - Martin Updated 11= /27/01 Moore (hamstring) was supposed to begin some light running last week= , but he ended up doing nothing of the sort. ""He hasn't made a lot of progr= ess,"" coach Dave McGinnis told the Arizona Republic. ""We're going to come t= o a point where we're going to have to make a decision."" Moore, who has mis= sed the entire season due to injury, could be placed on the injured reserve=  list this week.   More Updates [IMAGE]  Copyright 2001 Commissioner.COM In= c and SportsLine.com Inc.

He has been sidelined by an ankle i= njury.  Wade Richey , K SD - Free Agent Updated 11/27/01 Richey is likely t= o lose the starting placekicking job with the Chargers if they sign Steve C= hristie to a contract. San Diego would shift Richey to kickoffs only, after=  he missed two short field goals Sunday to drop to 21-for-30 on the ! se! a= son. In that case, you should drop Richey from your roster.  Steve Christie=  , K BUF - Hunter Shively Updated 11/27/01 The Chargers are expected to sig= n Christie on Tuesday provided he passes a physical, according to the San D= iego Union-Tribune. He would handle the field-goal chores for the remainder=  of the season, with Wade Richey shifting to kickoffs. If you're a Richey o= wner and need a kicker, Christie might be worth a pickup based on past hist= ory, but don't expect him to be one of the better kickers in the league eve= n if he does get the starting job.  Mark Brunell , QB JAC - Top Dogs Update= d 11/27/01 Brunell is questionable for Monday's game against Green Bay, the=  third straight week his status has been in question due to continued pain = in his quadriceps muscle. He will be limited again in practice, and it's pr= obably a good idea to keep him on reserve for Week 12 in your league.  Terr= ell Davis , RB DEN - Eric Bass Updated 11/27/01 Davis should be able to ret= urn from arthroscopic knee surgery in time for Sunday's game against Miami.=  He will practice this week before a final decision is made, but we're skep= tical the Broncos won't have him split carries with Mike Anderson, limiting=  both players' Fantasy values.  Keith Poole , WR DEN - Free Agent Updated 1= 1/27/01 Poole has bruised ribs that will likely keep him on the sidelines f= or Sunday's game against Miami. If he can't play, Kevin Kaspar would start = in his place, and the Denver passing game would further suffer.  Rod Smith = , WR DEN - Baja Updated 11/27/01 Smith now has two sprained ankles, and is = questionable for Sunday's game against Miami. If he can't play, then the Br= oncos might have to start Kevin Kaspar and Chris Cole at wideout, depending=  on Keith Poole's recovery from a rib injury.  James Jackson , RB CLE - Fre= e Agent Updated 11/27/01 Jackson's ankle remains sore, and he will be re-ev= aluated Wednesday to determine his status for Sunday's game against Tenness= ee. Benjamin Gay and Jamel White would continue to split carries if Jackson=  can't go.  Neil Rackers , K CIN - Free Agent Updated 11/27/01 Bengals Head=  Coach Dick LeBeau said Monday he has not yet made a decision on the status=  of Rackers, who missed two field-goal chances Sunday. He is 9-for-18 in fi= eld goals this season, and Jaret Holmes has been on the practice squad sinc= e Nov. 1. Ra! ck! ers will likely retain the job for Sunday's game against = Tampa Bay, but he's a very risky Fantasy starter based on his struggles.  A= kili Smith , QB CIN - Free Agent Updated 11/27/01 Bengals Head Coach Dick L= eBeau said Monday that Smith might be promoted to No. 2 quarterback, accord= ing to The Cincinnati Enquirer. ""If that's what they're going to do, maybe = the Bengals need to get rid of me,"" Smith said, citing a desire to be trade= d if he's used in a mop-up role. He's not a recommended Fantasy choice, alt= hough it's important to note that he's now likely next in line if Jon Kitna=  gets hurt.  Terry Allen  , RB BAL - Free Agent Updated 11/27/01 Allen, who=  remains out with a broken hand, could return to the lineup on Dec. 16. Wit= h the Ravens losing Jason Brookins to an injury, don't be surprised if Alle= n takes back the starting job once healthy. Hold onto him if you have the r= oom on your reserve list or play in a deeper league.  Moe Williams , RB BAL=  - Free Agent Updated 11/27/01 Williams becomes the Ravens' featured back a= fter the injury to Jason Brookins. If you play in a deeper league or are de= sperate for a running back, consider picking up Williams, although you shou= ldn't expect him to post great stats unless the matchup is very favorable. =  Jason Brookins , RB BAL - Free Agent Updated 11/27/01 Results of X-rays on=  Brookins' foot revealed a fracture of a bone in his small toe, which will = sideline him for at least four weeks and possibly the rest of the season. M= oe Williams becomes the Ravens' starting running back, and might be worth a= dding to your roster in a deeper league.  Wayne Chrebet , WR NYJ - Fear Upd= ated 11/27/01 Chrebret did not practice Monday because of a shoulder injury= . However, The New York Newsday reports that he is expected to play in Sund= ay's game.   Jake Arians , K BUF - Free Agent Updated 11/27/01 Arians has b= een released by the Bills. Buffalo has signed Shayne Graham to replace him.=    Edgerrin James , RB IND - Martin Cuilla Updated 11/27/01 Colts coach Jim=  Mora said James' surgery to repair a torn ligament in his left knee was su= ccessful Saturday in Miami.  Mora said he received the news from orthopedic=  surgeon Dr. Arthur Rettig, a team physician. ""I spoke with him Saturday an= d he told me it went very well,"" Mora said. James, the two-time NFL rushing=  champion, injured the knee when he was tackled awkwa! rd! ly late in a gam= e at Kansas City on Oct. 25. He was placed on injured reserve last week. Ja= mes' rehabilitation is expected to take seven months. He is not expected to=  take part in either of the Colts offseason minicamps. Team president Bill = Polian has not said whether James will be ready for the start of training c= amp.     Terry Glenn , WR NE - Tori Kuykendall Updated 11/27/01 Glenn could=  be put on injured reserve if he doesn't recover from a hamstring injury so= on. That would mean the end of his season, and perhaps the end of his Patri= ots career. ""I haven't reached it yet,"" coach Bill Belichick said Monday wh= en asked when he would decide if the roster spot would be better spent on s= omeone other than Glenn. ""But as each day goes by, it gets a little bit clo= ser! .""!   Shayne Graham , K SEA - Free Agent Updated 11/27/01 The Buffalo = Bills signed Graham as their kicker Tuesday, a day after Jake Arians was re= leased following a missed point-after against the Miami Dolphins. Graham ha= d been released by the Seattle Seahawks before the start of the season.   S= tephen Alexander , TE WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/27/01 Alexander, who has = been hampered by a ankle injury, returned to action on Sunday. He didn't st= art, however, and may lose playing time to both Walter Rasby and Zeron Flem= ister for the rest of the season. Unless you! p! lay in a deeper league, dr= opping Alexander is advisable.  Az-Zahir Hakim , WR STL - FIBSABs Updated 1= 1/27/01 Hakim, who is dealing with an ankle injury, played in Monday night'= s 24-17 loss to Tampa Bay. He had three catches for 29 yards in the game.  =  Kevan Barlow , RB SF - Free Agent Updated 11/27/01 Barlow suffered a dislo= cated shoulder during Sunday's win over Indianapolis. ""It's throbbing,"" Bar= low told the Contra Costa Times . ""I couldn't really sleep last night. I ha= d to sleep sitting up. It's hurting."" Barlow is listed as doubtful for Sund= ay's game against Buffalo, so be sure to place him on reserve.     Terrell = Owens , WR SF - Martin Cuilla Updated 11/27/01 Owens suffered a sprained ri= ght foot on Sunday to go along with his sprained left ankle. X-rays were ne= gative, but Owens' foot was placed in a protective boot as a precaution. He=  is expected to miss some practice time this week, but he will be in the st= arting lineup on Sunday when the Niners face Buffalo.   Jeff Thomason , TE = PHI - Free Agent Updated 11/27/01 Thomason suffered a hyperextended knee du= ring Sunday's loss to Washington. He missed practice on Monday, and is stat= us for Week 12 is uncertain at this time. The reserve tight end has very li= ttle value as a Fantasy player.   Donald Driver , WR GB - Free Agent Update= d 11/27/01 Driver, who has been inactive for three straight weeks due to a = thigh injury, returned to practice on Monday. His status for Week 12 remain= s unclear, but he's not worth starting on your Fantasy team in any event.  =  Tyrone Davis , TE GB - Rocks Updated 11/27/01 Davis, who has been out all = year due to a hamstring injury, will likely find out what his status with t= he Packers will be this week. Depending on his health, the team will either=  activate him, place him on injured reserve or cut him altogehter.   James = Stewart , RB DET - Tori Kuykendall Updated 11/27/01 Stewart, who suffered a=  neck stinger in last Thursday's game against Green Bay, is expected to be = available for Week 12. He'll have a tough time posting good Fantasy numbers=  against Chicago's tough run defense, but the lack of depth at running back=  in the league makes it tough to bench him.   Charlie Batch , QB DET - Rock= s Updated 11/27/01 According to the Detroit Free Press, Batch is expected t= o start Sunday's game against Chicago despite a groin injury. ""This is Char= lie's offense,"" coach Marty Mornhinweg said. ""He practiced a little bit tod= ay...he was in all weekend getting (the injury) treated...I would expect hi= m close to full speed Wednesday."" He'll likely lose snaps to rookie QB Mike=  McMahon, however, so starting Batch is a risky proposition.   Jackie Harri= s , TE DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/27/01 Harris missed last week's game aga= inst Denver due to a hamstring injury. The veteran tight end is listed as d= ay to day.   Anthony Thomas , RB CHI - Free Agent Updated 11/27/01 Accordin= g to coach Dick Jaroun, Thomas' status for Week 12 is still uncertain. In f= act, the Bears don't expect to know if Thomas, who is dealing with a hamstr= ing injury, will be available until later in the week.   Brad Hoover , RB C= AR - Free Agent Updated 11/27/01 Hoover (neck) will likely be held out of p= ractice this week. However, the Panthers are hopeful that he'll be availabl= e for Sunday's game against New Orleans.   More Updates  [IMAGE]  Copyright=  2001 Commissioner.COM Inc and SportsLine.com Inc.

If you dont like this email, then you just don't understand.    A chronology of events for Saturday,  December 4, 1999, and the early morning hours of Sunday, December 5, 1999: 6:00 Arise, play the Eyes of Texas and Texas Fight at full-freaking blast 6:20 Get in car, drive to New Braunfels  7:30 Tee off (me and a buddy were the FIRST tee-time of the morning) 8:50 Turn 9 (crack open first beer) 8:53 Crack open second beer 8:58 Crack open...(you get the idea) 10:30 Finish 18 (holes, as well as beers), sign scorecard for smoooooth 95 10:35 Headed for San Antonio 10:50 Buy three 18-packs for pre- and post-game festivities 11:10 We decide we don't have enough booze, so we double-back to a liquor store and buy the good ol' 750 ml plastic bottle ""Traveler"" Jim Beam 11:50 Arrive at the tailgate spot. Awesome day. Not a single cloud in the sky. About 70 degrees. 11:55 I decide that we're going to kick the shit out of Nebraska. 11:56 I tell my first Nebraska fan to go fuck himself. 12:15 The UT band walks by on the way to the Alamodome. We're on the second floor of a two-story parking garage on the corner (a couple hundred of us). We're hooting and hollering like wildmen. The band doubles back to the street right below us and serenades us with Texas Fight and The Eyes of Texas. AWESOME MOMENT. 12:25 In the post-serenade serendipity, 50-100 grown men are bumping chests with one another, each and every one of them now secure and certain of the fact that we are going to kick the shit out of Nebraska. 1:00 The Nebraska band walks by on the way to the Alamodome. Again, we hoot and holler like wildmen. Again, the band doubles back and stops right below us to serenade us, this time, however, with the Nebraska fight songs. Although somewhat impressed by their spirit and verve, we remain convinced that we are going to kick the shit out of Nebraska. 1:30 I begin the walk to the Alamodome, somehow managing to stuff the ""Traveler"" and 11 cans of beer into my pants. 1:47 I am in line surrounded by Nebraska fans. They are taunting me. I am taunting back, still certain that we are going to kick the shit out of Nebraska. I decide to challenge a particularly vocal Nebraska fan to play what I now call and will forever be remembered as ""Cell-Phone Flop Out."" Remember flop out for a dollar? The rules are similar. I tell this Nebraska jackass that if he's so confident in his team, he should ""flop out"" his cell phone RIGHT NOW and make plane reservations to Phoenix for the Fiesta Bowl. And then I spoke these memorable words: ""And not those damn refundable tickets, either! You request those non-refundable, non-transferrable sons-of-bitches!"" He backs down. He is unworthy. I call Southwest Airlines and buy two tickets to Phoenix, non-refundable and non-transferrable. Price: $712. He is humbled. He lowers his head in shame. I raise my cell phone in triumph to the cheers of hundreds of Texas fans. I am KING and these are my subjects. I distribute the 11 beers in my pants to the cheering masses. I RULE the pre-game kingdom. 2:34 Kickoff. Brimming with confidence, I open the Traveler and pour my first stiffy. 2:45 I notice something troubling: Nebraska is big. Nebraska is fast. Nebraska is very pissed off at Texas. 3:01 The first quarter mercifully ends. 9 yards total offense for Texas. Zero first downs for Texas. I'm still talking shit. I pour another stiffy from the Traveler. 3:36 Four minutes to go in the first half: the Traveler is a dead soldier. I buy my first $5 beer from the Alamodome merchants. While I am standing in line, a center snap nearly decapitates Major Applewhite and rolls out of the end zone. Safety. 3:56 Halftime score: Nebraska 15, Texas 0. I wish I had another Traveler. 4:11 While urinating next to a Nebraska fan in the bathroom at halftime, I attempt to revive the classic Brice-ism from the South Bend bathroom: ""Hey, buddy, niiiiiiiiice cock."" He is unamused. 4:21 I buy my 2nd and 3rd $5 beer from the Alamodome merchants. I share my beer with two high school girls sitting behind me. Surprisingly, they are equipped with a flask full of vodka. I send them off to purchase $5 Sprites, so that we may consume their vodka. I have not lost faith. Nebraska is a bunch of pussies. 4:51 No more vodka. The girls sitting behind me have fled for their lives. I purchase two more $5 beers from the Alamodome merchants. 5:18 Score is Nebraska 22, Texas 0. I am beginning to lose faith. This normally would trouble me, but I am too drunk to see the football field.  5:27 I call Southwest Airlines: ""I'm sorry, sir. Those tickets have been confirmed and are non-refundable and non-transferrable."" 5:37 I try to start a fight with every person behind the concession counter. As it turns out, the Alamodome has a policy that no beer can be sold when there is less than 10 minutes on the game clock. I am enraged by this policy. I ask loudly: ""Why the fuck didn't you announce last call over the fucking PA system??!!"" 5:49 Back in my seats, I am slumped in my chair in defeat. All of a sudden, the Texas crowd goes absolutely nuts. ""Whazzis?,"" I mutter, awaking from my coma, ""Iz we winnig? Did wez scort?"" Alas, the answer is no, we were not winning and we did not score. The largest (by far) cheer of the day from the Texas faithful occurred when the handlers were walking back to the tunnel and Bevo stopped to take a gargantuan shit all over the letters ""S"", ""K"", and ""A"" in the ""Nebraska"" spelled out in their end zone. I cheer wildly. I pick up the empty Traveler bottle and stick my tongue in it. I am thirsty. 6:16 Nebraska fans are going berserk as I walk back to the truck. I would taunt them with some off-color remarks about their parentage, but I am too drunk to form complete sentences. With my last cognitive thought of the evening, I take solace in the fact that if we had not beaten them in October, they would be playing Florida State for the national championship. 6:30 Back in the car. On the way back to Austin for the 8:00 Texas-Arizona tip off. We can still salvage the day! I crack open a beer. It is warm. I don't care. 7:12 We have stopped for gas. I am hungry. I go inside the store. I walk past the beer frig. I notice a Zima. I've never had a Zima. I wonder if it's any good. I pull a Zima from the frig. I twist the top off and drink the Zima in three swallows. Zima sucks. I replace the empty bottle in the frig. 7:17 There is a Blimpie Subs in the store. I walk to where the ingredients are, where the person usually makes the sub. There is no one there. I lean over the counter and scoop out half a bucket of black olives. I eat them. I am still hungry. I lean further over the counter and grab approximately two pounds of Pastrami. I walk out of the store grunting and eating Pastrami. The patrons in the store fear me. I don't care. 8:01 We are in South Austin. I have been drinking warm beer and singing Brooks and Dunn tunes for over an hour. My truck-mate is tired of my singing. He suggests that perhaps Brooks and Dunn have written other good songs besides ""You're Going to Miss Me When I'm Gone"" and ""Neon Moon"" and that maybe listening to only those two songs, ten times each was a bit excessive. Perhaps, he suggests, I could just let the CD play on its own. I tell him to fuck off and restart ""Neon Moon."" 8:30 We arrive at the Erwin Center. My truckmate, against my loud and profane protestations, parks on the top floor of a nearby parking garage. I tell him he's an idiot. I tell him we will never get out. I tell him we may as well pitch a fucking tent here. He ignores me. I think he's still pissed about the Brooks and Dunn tunes. I whistle ""Neon Moon"" loudly. 8:47 I am rallying. I have 4 warm beers stuffed in my pants. We're going to kick the shit out of Arizona. 9:11 Halftime score: Texas 31, Arizona 29. I am pleased. I go to the bathroom to pee for the 67th time today. I giggle to myself because of the new opportunity to do ""the bathroom Brice."" There are no Arizona fans in the bathroom. I am disappointed. I tell myself (out loud) that I have a ""Niiiiiice cock."" No one is amused but me. 9:41 I walk to the bathroom while drinking Bud Light out of a can. Needless to say, they do not sell beer at the Erwin Center, much less Bud Light out of a can. I am stopped by an usher: ""Where did you get that, sir?"" I tell him (no shit): ""Oh, the cheerleaders were throwing them up with those little plastic footballs. Would you mind throwing this away for me?"" I take the last swig and hand it to him. He is confused. I pretend I'm going to the bathroom, but I run away giggling instead. I duck into some entrance to avoid the usher, who is now pursuing me. I sneak into a large group of people and sit down. The usher walks by harmlessly. I am giggling like a little girl. I crack open another can of Bud Light. 9:52 I am lost. In my haste to avoid the usher, I have lost my bearings. I have no ticket stub. I cannot find my seats. Texas is losing. 10:09 Texas is being screwed by the refs. I am enraged. I have cleared out the seats around me because I keep removing my hat and beating the surrounding chairs with it. A concerned fan asks if I'm OK and perhaps I shouldn't take it so seriously. I tell him to fuck off. 10:15 After the fourth consecutive ""worst fucking call I have EVER seen,"" I attempt to remove my hat again to begin beating inanimate objects. However, on this occasion I miscalculate and I thumbnail myself in my left eyelid, leaving a one-quarter inch gash over my eye. I am now bleeding into my left eye and all over my shirt. ""Perhaps,"" I think to myself, ""I'm taking this a bit seriously."" 10:22 I am standing in the bathroom peeing. I'm so drunk I am swaying and grunting. I have a bloody napkin pressed on my left eye. My pants are bloody. I have my (formerly) white shirt wrapped around my waist. I look like I should be in an episode of Cops. 10:43 Texas has lost. I put my bloody white shirt back on my body and make my way for the exits. I am stopped every 20 seconds by a good samaritan/cop/security guard to ask me why I am covered in blood, but I merely grunt incoherently and keep moving. 10:59 With my one good eye, I have located the parking garage. I walk up six flights of stairs, promise that when I see my friend I will punch him in the face for making me walk up six flights of stairs, find the truck, and collapse in a heap in the bed of the truck. I look around and notice that traffic is lined up all the way around the garage, six whole flights, and no one is moving. I take a nap. 11:17 I awake from my nap. I see my friend in the driver's seat. I lift my head to look out the bed of the truck and notice that traffic is lined up all the way around the garage, six whole flights, and no one is moving. I am too tired to punch my friend. I call my friend a ""Stupid fuck."" 11:31 I lift my head to look out the bed of the truck and notice that traffic is lined up all the way around the garage, six whole flights, and no one is moving. I call my friend a ""Stupid fuck.""  11:38 I lift my head to look out the bed of the truck and notice that traffic is lined up all the way around the garage, six whole flights, and no one is moving. I call my friend a ""Stupid fuck.""  11:47 I lift my head to look out the bed of the truck and notice that traffic is lined up all the way around the garage, six whole flights, and no one is moving. I call my friend a ""Stupid fuck.""  11:58 I am jostled. The truck is moving. I lift my head to look out the bed of the truck and notice that traffic is beginning to move on the second floor. I jump out of the truck, walk to the edge of the parking facility, and pee off the sixth floor onto the street below. My friend looks at me like I just anally violated his minor sister. I turn around and pee on the front of his truck while singing the lyrics to ""Neon Moon."" 12:11 We are moving. We are out of beer. I jump from the truck and go from vehicle to vehicle until someone gives me two beers. I am happy. I return to my vehicle. 12:26 We have emerged from the parking facility. We make our way to my apartment and find Ed sitting on the couch with a freshly opened bottle of Glenlivet on the coffee table in front of him. We are all going to die tonight. 12:59 We have finished three-quarters of the bottle of Glenlivet. We decide it would be a wonderful idea to go dancing at PollyEsther's. Ed has to pee. He walks down the hall to our apartment and directly into the full length mirror at the end of the hall, smashing it into hundreds of pieces. We giggle uncontrollably and leave for PollyEsther's. 1:17 The PollyEsther's doorman laughs uncontrollably at our efforts to enter his club. ""Fellas,"" he says in between his fits of spastic laughter, ""I've been working this door for almost a year. I've been working doors in this town for almost 5 years. And I can honestly say that I ain't never seen three drunker mother fuckers than you three. Sorry, can't let you in."" We attempt to reason with him. He laughs harder. 1:44 We find a bar that lets us in. We take two steps in the door and hear ""Last call for alcohol!"" I turn to the group and mutter: ""See, dat wasn't that fuckin' hard. Day don't fuckin' do that at the Awamo...the awaom...the alab...fuck it, that stadium we was at today..."" We order 6 shots of tequila and three beers. 2:15 Back on the street. We need food. We hail a cab to take us the two and one half blocks to Katz's. The cab fare is $1.60. We give him $10 and tell him to keep it. 2:17 There is a 20 minute wait. We give the hostess $50. We are seated immediately. 2:25 We order two orders of fried pickles, a Cobb salad, a bowl of soup, two orders of Blueberry blintzes, two Reuben sandwiches, a hamburger, two cheese stuffed potatoes, an order of fries, and an order of onion rings. 2:39 The food arrives. We are all asleep with our heads on the table. The waiter wakes us up. We eat every fucking bit of our food. Most of the restaurant patrons around us are disgusted. We don't give a shit. The tab is $112 with tip. 2:46 I'm sleepy. 9:12 I wake up next to a strange woman. She is the bartender at Katz's. She is not pretty.",frank.ermis@enron.com,matthew.lenhart@enron.com,FW: [Fwd: a day in the life],2001-11-28 12:49:14-08:00,sent
