"I've reviewed the O&M Agreement and here is a summary of the provisions we  might use in describing to the Commission why it meets the requirement that  TW have control over the compressor motor.  The O&M Agreement (OMA) provides that ECS will pay TW a fee for operating and  maintaining the compressor motor facilities as described in the agreement.   TW, as Operator, is required to operate and maintain the motor facilities  pursuant to and consistent with i) the policies and procedures of Enron  Operating Company's Standard Operating Procedures, a copy of which has been  approved by Operator, ii) the requirements of all laws (which includes  regulations, rules, orders, or other similar action of any governmental  authority), and iii) the OMA.  Operator is required to provide O&M services  described in the agreement, including procuring and furnishing, at its sole  cost and expense, all materials, equipment, services, supplies and labor  necessary for routine operation and maintenance in accordance with all  material agreements, laws, incurance policies and permits.  Additionally,  Operator is responsible for filing all reports required by law and obtaining  any permits, licenses and approvals required by law.    Operator is  responsible for taking appropriate action in case of an emergency.  ECS has  the right to observe and consult with Operator in connection with performance  of Operator's duties, in order to ensure compliance with the OMA.  A bad fact:  The agreement is terminable by either party upon 30 days written  notice.  Since this ostensibly ECS could ostensibly replace TW at any time  with ",drew.fossum@enron.com,susan.scott@enron.com,Gallup compressor contract,1979-12-31 16:00:00-08:00,sent
"Frazier and Dari:  Elizabeth Brown and Rita Bianchi have asked whether we  need to include our so-called ""pool"" contracts on TW's index of customers.   These are FTS-1 agreements which have a reservation charge of $0 for transfer  from a pool to a point within the pool (involving no actual movement of  gas).  Historically TW has categorized such agreements as ""administrative""  and has not included them on the index of customers.  Apparently we need the  contracts to exist as FTS-1 agreements for internal purposes.    I suppose the question has come up again in Elizabeth's and Rita's review of  our postings for Order 637 purposes:  whether the two ""pool"" contracts (Amoco  and Burlington) need to be included on the Index of Customers.  I suppose  that technically they should be since they are called FTS-1 agreements.   However, I have very little heartburn with continuing to leave them off the  list since no transportation is ever involved.    My main concern is that we be consistent among the pipelines, in order to  simplify the maintenance of our websites.

"You have asked me to outline the argument that would be used in requesting a  motion to expedite the Commission's decision in this proceeding.  The motion  would be filed pursuant to Rule 212 of the Commission's Rules of Practice and  Procedure, which simply allows parties to file motions.  Sempra is not yet a  party, so it would have to include in its pleading a motion to intervene out  of time.  The Commission may grant late interventions pursuant to Rule 214 if  the movant has good cause for failing to file the motion on time, permitting  the intervention will cause no significant disruption of the proceeding, the  movant's interest is not adequately represented by other parties in the  proceeding, and no prejudice to other parties would result from granting late  intervenor status.  Additionally, like other intervenors, Sempra must also  explain its interest in the proceeding, including why it has a right to  participate, why it could be directly affected by the outcome of the  proceeding, and that its participation in the proceeding would be in the  public interest.  (We've seen numerous interventions by Sempra and they have  some standard language they use in their interventions to describe the  company and request intervenor status).     The basis for requesting expedited status of the SWGas application would be  that Sempra's Gallup Expansion transport agreement includes a provision ",jeffery.fawcett@enron.com,susan.scott@enron.com,Southwest Gas proceeding,1979-12-31 16:00:00-08:00,sent

Also, Susan, what is the protocol for a case being litigated at  the CPUC for inquiries like this?  Should we put a disclaimer that the  information we might provide is protected under Rule 51 or other ""settlement  discussions only"" protection?    Mr. Pedersen, First, I'd like to clear-up the nomenclature being used here.  As you know,  currently SoCalGas doesn't assign ""primary rights"" to deliveries off of any  interconnecting pipeline.  The establishment of tradeable rights for  intrastate capacity is among the issues currently under consideration in the  CPUC proceeding.   However, if what you are asking about is what has been the  historical or otherwise available receipt capacity for Transwestern  deliveries at North Needles, then let me offer the following.   Transwestern has always operated on the premise that SoCalGas could  physically accept up to a maximum of 750 MMcf/d at its North Needles receipt  point.  Consequently, Transwestern has sold firm transportation to its  interstate customers for west flow deliveries to North Needles not to exceed  the 750 MMcf/d limitation.  Our west flow mainline capacity is 1.09 Bcf/d.   The 340 MMcf/d difference between the mainline capacity and the physical  capacity into SoCalGas at North Needles is used to provide firm service at  our other delivery points at or near the California border, including PG&E,  Mojave, Southwest Gas, Citizens Utilities, and in the near future, directly  connected electric generation plants.

If you have any questions, please  e-mail or call me (x30596).   ---------------------- Forwarded by Susan Scott/ET&S/Enron on 12/30/99 12:41  PM ---------------------------   Kevin Hyatt 12/30/99 12:39 PM To: Susan Scott/ET&S/Enron@ENRON cc:    Subject: The El Paso Controversy Continues   ---------------------- Forwarded by Kevin Hyatt/ET&S/Enron on 12/30/99 12:38  PM --------------------------- ET & S Business Intelligence From: Lorna Brennan on 12/30/99 09:18 AM To: Bill Cordes/ET&S/Enron@ENRON, Julie McCoy/ET&S/Enron@ENRON, Lou  Geiler/ET&S/Enron@ENRON, Tim Aron/ET&S/Enron@ENRON, Steve  Klimesh/ET&S/Enron@ENRON, Sarabeth Smith/ET&S/Enron@ENRON, Gary  Sova/ET&S/Enron@ENRON, Rob Wilson/ET&S/Enron@ENRON, Lon  Stanton/ET&S/Enron@Enron, Margaret Carson/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Rita  Hartfield/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Rockey Storie/ET&S/Enron@ENRON, Stephanie  Miller/ET&S/Enron@ENRON, Kent Miller/ET&S/Enron@ENRON, John  Dushinske/ET&S/Enron@ENRON, Dave Neubauer/ET&S/Enron@ENRON, Michael  Bodnar/ET&S/Enron@ENRON, Joni Bollinger/ET&S/Enron@ENRON, David  Badura/ET&S/Enron@Enron, Janet Bowers/ET&S/Enron@ENRON, Craig  Buehler/ET&S/Enron@ENRON, Bob Burleson/ET&S/Enron@ENRON, Allen  Cohrs/ET&S/Enron@ENRON, John Fiscus/ET&S/Enron@ENRON, Bret  Fritch/ET&S/Enron@Enron, Steve Gilbert/ET&S/Enron@ENRON, Morgan  Gottsponer/ET&S/Enron@ENRON, Brenda Harris/ET&S/Enron@ENRON, James  Harvey/ET&S/Enron@ENRON, Stephen Herber/ET&S/Enron@ENRON, Dana  Jones/ET&S/Enron@ENRON, Jane Joyce/ET&S/Enron@ENRON, Stephanie  Korbelik/ET&S/Enron@ENRON, Therese Lohman/ET&S/Enron@ENRON, Bill  Mangels/ET&S/Enron@ENRON, Penny McCarran/ET&S/Enron@ENRON, Vernon  Mercaldo/ET&S/Enron@ENRON, Larry Pavlou/ET&S/Enron@ENRON, Eileen  Peebles/ET&S/Enron@ENRON, Maria Perales/ET&S/Enron@ENRON, Tony  Perry/ET&S/Enron@Enron, Loren Penkava/ET&S/Enron@ENRON, Ken  Powers/ET&S/Enron@ENRON, Joan Schwieger/ET&S/Enron@ENRON, Chris  Sebesta/ET&S/Enron@ENRON, Frank Semin/ET&S/Enron@Enron, Neal  Shaw/ET&S/Enron@ENRON, Larry Swett/ET&S/Enron@ENRON, Kay  Threet/ET&S/Enron@ENRON, Mike Ullom/ET&S/Enron@ENRON, Lisa  Valley/ET&S/Enron@Enron, Chuck Wilkinson/ET&S/Enron@ENRON, Jim  Wiltfong/ET&S/Enron@ENRON, Jo Williams/ET&S/Enron@ENRON, Karen  Lagerstrom/ET&S/Enron@Enron, Ray Stelly/ET&S/Enron@ENRON, Bob  Stevens/ET&S/Enron@Enron, Sue M Neville/ET&S/Enron@ENRON, Mike  Barry/ET&S/Enron@ENRON, Miriam Martinez/ET&S/Enron@ENRON, Martha  Janousek/ET&S/Enron@ENRON, Kimberly Watson/ET&S/Enron@ENRON, Don  Powell/ET&S/Enron@ENRON, Melinda Tosoni/ET&S/Enron@ENRON, Steve  Weller/ET&S/Enron@ENRON, Michael G Stage/ET&S/Enron@ENRON, Tim  Johanson/ET&S/Enron@ENRON, Mike McGowan/ET&S/Enron@ENRON, Steven  Harris/ET&S/Enron@ENRON, Lindy Donoho/ET&S/Enron@ENRON, Jeffery  Fawcett/ET&S/Enron@ENRON, Lorraine Lindberg/ET&S/Enron@ENRON, Kevin  Hyatt/ET&S/Enron@Enron, Christine Stokes/ET&S/Enron@ENRON, Drew  Fossum/ET&S/Enron@ENRON, Lee Huber/ET&S/Enron@ENRON, Maria  Pavlou/ET&S/Enron@ENRON, Mary Kay Miller/ET&S/Enron@ENRON, Glen  Hass/ET&S/Enron@ENRON, Donna Fulton/Corp/Enron@ENRON cc:   Subject: The El Paso Controversy Continues  Enron-El Paso Deal Could Mute Competition to CA       Fearing an end to pipeline competition in California, the state's  regulators and Indicated      Shippers have called on FERC to summarily reject the three  transportation agreements by      which Enron North America Corp. has contracted for 1.25 Bcf/d of  unsubscribed firm      capacity on El Paso Natural Gas.        Approval of these agreements would give Enron Corp., parent of  Transwestern Pipeline      and Enron North America, control over all the available transportation  capacity to the      southern California border, warned Harvey Morris, principal attorney for  the California      Public Utilities Commission (CPUC), which plans to submit its protest  today. Between      the two pipelines, he estimated Enron will control 2.34 Bcf/d of firm  capacity from the      San Juan and Permian basins to California.        For Morris, Enron North America's contracting of the El Paso capacity  represents a      worse threat to the pipeline's other shippers than Dynegy Marketing and  Trade, who has      held the capacity for past two years and whose contract expires Dec. 31.  ""At least then      there was some Transwestern competition to the Dynegy situation. Now  it's Enron, the      owner of Transwestern, who's stepping into Dynegy's shoes.""        But ""what's even worse,"" he told NGI, is the revenue-sharing provision  in the contracts. It      stipulates that ""after Enron makes $35 million off of these contracts,  it has to share the      proceeds with El Paso for 25% of anything beyond $35 million. So  effectively, Enron and      El Paso have become partners in how high they can jack up the  transportation rate      differential between the California border and the Southwest producing  basins.""        The two pipeline companies ""that have for decades competed with each  other in carrying      Southwest supplies to California are now partners. We think that's  anticompetitive, and      there's no way FERC should approve it,"" Morris said. He recalled the  basis differential      between the San Juan Basin spot price and the California border shot up  by 17% during      1998, the first year during which Dynegy controlled the El Paso capacity  into California.      This situation could worsen under Enron, he believes.        ""At first blush the El Paso-Enron contracts [do] not appear to contain  the same      anticompetitive features of the El Paso-Dynegy contracts,"" Indicated  Shippers noted, but      a ""closer review and analysis"" reveals the anticompetitive effects of  the revenue-sharing      provision (RSP) in El Paso-Enron contracts ""are not only similar"" to  those of the hotly      contested reservation-reduction mechanism (RRM) in the El Paso-Dynegy  case, ""but are      increased......due to the fact that the contracts are with a marketing  affiliate of El Paso's      primary interstate pipeline competitor,"" Transwestern.        Both the RRM and RSP ""operate to provide a disincentive for El Paso and  its competitors      to compete against each other, or to take any other action that will act  to drive down the      basis differential that defines the market value of the capacity,""  Indicated Shippers told      FERC in a protest filed on Wednesday [RP97-287-041]. The group includes  producers      Amoco Production, Burlington Resources Oil and Gas, Marathon Oil, and  Phillips      Petroleum, and two marketers - Amoco Energy Trading and Phillips Gas  Marketing.        FERC ""should reject the tariff filing immediately. The Commission erred  in allowing the      El Paso-Dynegy contracts to remain intact for their two-year term after  finding that the      contracts were anticompetitive. This issue is pending in the [D.C. Court  of Appeals].      That same error should not be repeated here,"" the producers and  marketers said.        The CPUC's attempt to block the Enron-El Paso contracts at the outset is  a little bit      unusual for the agency, Morris said, but it learned its lesson following  Dynegy. ""When the      Dynegy situation first hit, we asked for FERC to investigate the matter.  We thought      FERC did a very inadequate job then.....This time around we're asking  for FERC to      summarily reject it. It's hard for an agency like ours to take such a  strong stand right at      the beginning, but we've learned too much from two years of suffering  under the Dynegy      situation. And this is even worse.""        In the event the Commission should reject California's request, the CPUC  has asked that      an ""anti-hoarding condition"" be included in the contracts, which would  require Enron to      release unused capacity into the short-term market at a price higher  than what it's paying      El Paso for the capacity. ""They must make a little profit,"" Morris  noted. ""We're confident      Enron can't use the entire 1.2 Bcf/d of capacity.....so there's going to  be unused      capacity.""        The agency also wants FERC to clarify that the primary delivery point  for the Block II      portion of the capacity (579MMcf/d) is PG&E-Topock in keeping with the  terms of the      1996 settlement between El Paso and its customers. Morris said he agreed  fully with      Amoco, Burlington Resources and Southern California Gas (SoCalGas),  which accused      El Paso of violating the 1996 agreement by allowing Dynegy to use  SoCalGas-Topock as      a primary delivery point for the Block II capacity last summer. They  contend the alleged      violation is included in the Enron contracts.        He also noted the CPUC will challenge the ability of Enron to call back  Block II capacity      after it already had been recalled by El Paso shippers to serve Pacific  Gas and Electric      (PG&E) customers in northern California. Last July, FERC granted Dynegy  the right to      do this under its contracts with El Paso. But Morris contends the  decision violates the      1996 settlement under which PG&E paid $54 million to preserve the right  of the pipeline's      shippers to recall the Block II capacity to serve end-users in its  service territory.        The CPUC also intends to challenge the Commission's decision that would  enable Enron      to ""just sit on the capacity,"" thereby withholding idle Block II  capacity from the market.      Indicated Shippers also contend the Enron contracts violate the Block II  capacity      provisions of the 1996 rate case, as well as ""exacerbate"" the primary  firm delivery point      capacity-allocation issues that are pending before FERC now.        The CPUC accused El Paso of ""deliberately"" filing the Enron contracts at  FERC just      before the holidays to avoid controversy. The pipeline ""is trying to  sneak one of the most      controversial things ever past FERC right before Christmas so that  protests would be      minimized,"" said Morris. ""They did this with the Dynegy contracts two  years ago. They      have a pattern of filing right at the last minute, making it harder for  people to protest and      harder for FERC to stop it from going into effect.""     ,Copyright 1999 Intelligence Press Inc.

Marathon and Phillips have joined in the protest, attacking the entire deal as anti-competitive. The protesters hope FERC will force El Paso to begin again with capacity assignments. Amoco and Burlington had already protested the deal two weeks ago at FERC, when they claimed the sale would violate El Paso?s rate case settlement and tariff. The shippers argue that El Paso was trying to sell part of that primary firm capacity at delivery points other than PG&E/Topock), which the settlement prohibits. The settlement was intended to protect PG&E and allow it to access service. If this capacity is delivered at other points such as SoCal/Topock, it could add to the glut at that point, the protesters argued. El Paso and Enron stand to gain if the basis differential between the San Juan Basin and California remains large. Marathon and Phillips say that Enron and El Paso can manipulate that basis differential because between them and their affiliates they control all the excess capacity from the San Juan Basin to California. ______________________________________________________________________ Energy Seminars New 2000 Dates!

Speculator long positions now outnumber short positions by 1.4 to 1 compared with a ratio of 2.9 to 1 two weeks earlier and 3.8 to 1 four weeks earlier. Prices peaked at a post-Gulf-War high of $27.15 a barrel November 22nd and ended the year at $25.60. Long positions in crude oil futures on the NYMEX held by hedge funds and large speculators were 44,233 on December 28th, little changed from 44,693 on December 14th, according to the CFTC. Speculator short positions doubled, though, to 31,868 from 15,364. Speculators also became less bullish about both gasoline and heating oil as their short positions increased much more than the long positions did during the two-week period. The ratio of longs to shorts in gasoline fell to about 3-to-2 from 20-to-1. For natural gas, speculators increased their overall bet that gas prices would fall. They had placed bets for rising gas prices from April until mid-November, when a lack of severe cold weather demand pulled prices down from a two-year high. The following table shows the changes in speculator positions for crude oil, heating oil, gasoline and natural gas futures.

The transaction is expected to close in February. The sale includes natural gas reserves totaling approximately 1.1 Tcf, 6,500 production wells, and 4,000 miles of pipeline network in Kentucky, West Virginia, Pennsylvania and Ohio. Sale of the exploration and production business is the first step in The Statoil Group?s overall plan of complete divestment of Statoil Energy. Statoil Energy?s remaining businesses, power generation, energy marketing and trading,  will be offered for sale in a separate process starting later this month. The divestment plan is part of Statoil?s overall restructuring program to concentrate on its core business activities: exploration and production in Norway and other selected areas of the world; the European natural gas and energy business; crude oil trading, refining and marketing; and petrochemicals. Equitable?s market capitalization is $1.1 billion. ______________________________________________________________________  TAGE The Austin Group Energy Executive Search Consultants  pj@austingrp.com -  <A HREF=""http://www.austingrp.com"">www.austingrp.com</A> Phone (281) 497-8595  -   Fax (281) 597-0099 ______________________________________________________________________  EPRI Launches Customized Technical Support Services Subsidiary     A new subsidiary of the Electric Power Research Institute will offer customized technical support services to both members and non-members of its research program. EPRIsolutions is a for-profit subsidiary created to hasten the application of EPRI technologies already developed through decades of collaborative research. EPRIsolutions will work directly with our customers to select, install and support the EPRI technologies most suitable for their particular needs. Many of the services offered will be performed by the staff of EPRI?s Technology Application Centers located throughout the US. For example, the Engineering and Test Centers in Lenox, Mass. and Haslet, Tex. can provide audits of utility power delivery systems to identify weaknesses before they lead to outages. The Maintenance and Diagnostics Center in Charlotte, N.C. can help customers save on the cost of operating and maintaining their fossil-fired power plants. As an example of how such integrated services will be offered, EPRIsolutions can help customers adapt and install the powerful, sophisticated software packages now available for load forecasting, environmental risk assessment, and retail market management. In some cases, EPRIsolutions will go one step further by acting as an application service provider for companies that want to outsource data-intensive operations. The first such ASP activity will be on-line monitoring and diagnosis of water chemistry for several nuclear power plants. EPRIsolutions is being formed through the merger of two existing subsidiaries, EPRICSG and EPRIGEN, which were created to allow EPRI to conduct proprietary R&D on behalf of individual funders, who would retain rights to the intellectual property involved. In addition to continuing this activity, EPRIsolutions takes on the function of providing customized technology application and consulting services. Such private-benefit work lies beyond the scope of EPRI's tax-exempt, collaborative research mission and thus requires the use of a taxable subsidiary. ______________________________________________________________________  HEAD?S UP? PRICES DOWN!      Natural gas prices have fallen to $2.40/MMBtu from $3.20/MMBtu just last month. Storage injections still outweigh storage withdrawals. Where will prices go? Depends on the weather. If it is warm in Houston and New York City over the Thanksgiving holidays, will prices continue to head south? Under those conditions, they have since 1993. Call it ?Rader?s Stupid Frozen Turkey Theory? or call it storage fundamentals, but be prepared in case this silly theory comes true one more year.

Calpine bought the remaining 58% interest in the Rio Vista field that it did not already own, along with some exploration rights. It received the 42%  stake when it acquired Sheridan Energy last November for $128 million. Calpine plans to purchasing natural gas fields and pipelines so it can provide fuel for its natural gas powered generators at lower costs. Calpine plans to expand its electric generation businesses in California, Texas, Arizona and Nevada along with the Southeast and Northeast. It operates power plants that can generate 3,400 MW. .

(by contrast, williams  bought about 0.1 bcf/day at an average rate of $.207.)   el paso released  this information via a a press release without any prior approval from ena.   julie, please don't hesitate to fill any holes or (unintended) innaccuracies.  the situation is complicated by the fact that california is currently in the  midst of intense negotiations over restructuring the state's gas industry.   the negotiations have been going on for about 8 months and have been very  contentious.  socal has teamed with indicated producers, california  manufacturers association, and muni generators from southern california to  push a very ""go slow"" approach that is (surprise) quite friendly to larger  users.  enron is teamed with western hub storage, wild goose storage,  calpine, southern california edison, green mountain power, the city of  vernon, and spurr/remac (provides services to california's k-12 school  system) under an alliance called ""california alliance for competition""  (snappy, i know).  the cac proposal is pushing, among other things, a single,  state-wide market for transport, storage and balancing, including tradeable  rights in a secondary market.  indicated producers has been aggressive and hostile toward marketers--as has  cma--throughout the negotiations.  ip's bile has not been reserved solely for  enron, however.  one outcome of the negotiations has been the suit ip  launched against el paso at ferc regarding el paso's nom process.  (i believe  ena filed in support of the suit.)  el paso is losing that one and will  likely change its nom process sooner rather than later.  i think it's important to have a quick call to develop a clear and consistent  message on the ena deal and coordinate what we're saying about that deal with  the other gas issues on the table.  i'm assuming that if there's anything we  can do to keep harvey morris (and california) from mucking up the deal, the  better.  i know harvey well.  i'm not sure, given his quotes, there's much  ""educating"" to be done, but may make sense to meet with him, nonetheless.   more important, indicated producers is the real--and biggest--problem.  let me know if you folks think there'd be value in briefly discussing the  issue.  best, jeff    Kevin Hyatt@ENRON 12/30/99 10:51 AM To: Jeff Dasovich/SFO/EES@EES, Joseph Alamo/SFO/EES@EES cc:   Subject: The El Paso Controversy Continues  CPUC attorney Harvey Morris obviously has NO CLUE on how the transportation  business works.   ---------------------- Forwarded by Kevin Hyatt/ET&S/Enron on 12/30/99 12:49  PM --------------------------- ET & S Business Intelligence From: Lorna Brennan on 12/30/99 09:18 AM To: Bill Cordes/ET&S/Enron@ENRON, Julie McCoy/ET&S/Enron@ENRON, Lou  Geiler/ET&S/Enron@ENRON, Tim Aron/ET&S/Enron@ENRON, Steve  Klimesh/ET&S/Enron@ENRON, Sarabeth Smith/ET&S/Enron@ENRON, Gary  Sova/ET&S/Enron@ENRON, Rob Wilson/ET&S/Enron@ENRON, Lon  Stanton/ET&S/Enron@Enron, Margaret Carson/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Rita  Hartfield/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Rockey Storie/ET&S/Enron@ENRON, Stephanie  Miller/ET&S/Enron@ENRON, Kent Miller/ET&S/Enron@ENRON, John  Dushinske/ET&S/Enron@ENRON, Dave Neubauer/ET&S/Enron@ENRON, Michael  Bodnar/ET&S/Enron@ENRON, Joni Bollinger/ET&S/Enron@ENRON, David  Badura/ET&S/Enron@Enron, Janet Bowers/ET&S/Enron@ENRON, Craig  Buehler/ET&S/Enron@ENRON, Bob Burleson/ET&S/Enron@ENRON, Allen  Cohrs/ET&S/Enron@ENRON, John Fiscus/ET&S/Enron@ENRON, Bret  Fritch/ET&S/Enron@Enron, Steve Gilbert/ET&S/Enron@ENRON, Morgan  Gottsponer/ET&S/Enron@ENRON, Brenda Harris/ET&S/Enron@ENRON, James  Harvey/ET&S/Enron@ENRON, Stephen Herber/ET&S/Enron@ENRON, Dana  Jones/ET&S/Enron@ENRON, Jane Joyce/ET&S/Enron@ENRON, Stephanie  Korbelik/ET&S/Enron@ENRON, Therese Lohman/ET&S/Enron@ENRON, Bill  Mangels/ET&S/Enron@ENRON, Penny McCarran/ET&S/Enron@ENRON, Vernon  Mercaldo/ET&S/Enron@ENRON, Larry Pavlou/ET&S/Enron@ENRON, Eileen  Peebles/ET&S/Enron@ENRON, Maria Perales/ET&S/Enron@ENRON, Tony  Perry/ET&S/Enron@Enron, Loren Penkava/ET&S/Enron@ENRON, Ken  Powers/ET&S/Enron@ENRON, Joan Schwieger/ET&S/Enron@ENRON, Chris  Sebesta/ET&S/Enron@ENRON, Frank Semin/ET&S/Enron@Enron, Neal  Shaw/ET&S/Enron@ENRON, Larry Swett/ET&S/Enron@ENRON, Kay  Threet/ET&S/Enron@ENRON, Mike Ullom/ET&S/Enron@ENRON, Lisa  Valley/ET&S/Enron@Enron, Chuck Wilkinson/ET&S/Enron@ENRON, Jim  Wiltfong/ET&S/Enron@ENRON, Jo Williams/ET&S/Enron@ENRON, Karen  Lagerstrom/ET&S/Enron@Enron, Ray Stelly/ET&S/Enron@ENRON, Bob  Stevens/ET&S/Enron@Enron, Sue M Neville/ET&S/Enron@ENRON, Mike  Barry/ET&S/Enron@ENRON, Miriam Martinez/ET&S/Enron@ENRON, Martha  Janousek/ET&S/Enron@ENRON, Kimberly Watson/ET&S/Enron@ENRON, Don  Powell/ET&S/Enron@ENRON, Melinda Tosoni/ET&S/Enron@ENRON, Steve  Weller/ET&S/Enron@ENRON, Michael G Stage/ET&S/Enron@ENRON, Tim  Johanson/ET&S/Enron@ENRON, Mike McGowan/ET&S/Enron@ENRON, Steven  Harris/ET&S/Enron@ENRON, Lindy Donoho/ET&S/Enron@ENRON, Jeffery  Fawcett/ET&S/Enron@ENRON, Lorraine Lindberg/ET&S/Enron@ENRON, Kevin  Hyatt/ET&S/Enron@Enron, Christine Stokes/ET&S/Enron@ENRON, Drew  Fossum/ET&S/Enron@ENRON, Lee Huber/ET&S/Enron@ENRON, Maria  Pavlou/ET&S/Enron@ENRON, Mary Kay Miller/ET&S/Enron@ENRON, Glen  Hass/ET&S/Enron@ENRON, Donna Fulton/Corp/Enron@ENRON cc:   Subject: The El Paso Controversy Continues  Enron-El Paso Deal Could Mute Competition to CA       Fearing an end to pipeline competition in California, the state's  regulators and Indicated      Shippers have called on FERC to summarily reject the three  transportation agreements by      which Enron North America Corp. has contracted for 1.25 Bcf/d of  unsubscribed firm      capacity on El Paso Natural Gas.        Approval of these agreements would give Enron Corp., parent of  Transwestern Pipeline      and Enron North America, control over all the available transportation  capacity to the      southern California border, warned Harvey Morris, principal attorney for  the California      Public Utilities Commission (CPUC), which plans to submit its protest  today. Between      the two pipelines, he estimated Enron will control 2.34 Bcf/d of firm  capacity from the      San Juan and Permian basins to California.        For Morris, Enron North America's contracting of the El Paso capacity  represents a      worse threat to the pipeline's other shippers than Dynegy Marketing and  Trade, who has      held the capacity for past two years and whose contract expires Dec. 31.  ""At least then      there was some Transwestern competition to the Dynegy situation. Now  it's Enron, the      owner of Transwestern, who's stepping into Dynegy's shoes.""        But ""what's even worse,"" he told NGI, is the revenue-sharing provision  in the contracts. It      stipulates that ""after Enron makes $35 million off of these contracts,  it has to share the      proceeds with El Paso for 25% of anything beyond $35 million. So  effectively, Enron and      El Paso have become partners in how high they can jack up the  transportation rate      differential between the California border and the Southwest producing  basins.""        The two pipeline companies ""that have for decades competed with each  other in carrying      Southwest supplies to California are now partners. We think that's  anticompetitive, and      there's no way FERC should approve it,"" Morris said. He recalled the  basis differential      between the San Juan Basin spot price and the California border shot up  by 17% during      1998, the first year during which Dynegy controlled the El Paso capacity  into California.      This situation could worsen under Enron, he believes.        ""At first blush the El Paso-Enron contracts [do] not appear to contain  the same      anticompetitive features of the El Paso-Dynegy contracts,"" Indicated  Shippers noted, but      a ""closer review and analysis"" reveals the anticompetitive effects of  the revenue-sharing      provision (RSP) in El Paso-Enron contracts ""are not only similar"" to  those of the hotly      contested reservation-reduction mechanism (RRM) in the El Paso-Dynegy  case, ""but are      increased......due to the fact that the contracts are with a marketing  affiliate of El Paso's      primary interstate pipeline competitor,"" Transwestern.        Both the RRM and RSP ""operate to provide a disincentive for El Paso and  its competitors      to compete against each other, or to take any other action that will act  to drive down the      basis differential that defines the market value of the capacity,""  Indicated Shippers told      FERC in a protest filed on Wednesday [RP97-287-041]. The group includes  producers      Amoco Production, Burlington Resources Oil and Gas, Marathon Oil, and  Phillips      Petroleum, and two marketers - Amoco Energy Trading and Phillips Gas  Marketing.        FERC ""should reject the tariff filing immediately. The Commission erred  in allowing the      El Paso-Dynegy contracts to remain intact for their two-year term after  finding that the      contracts were anticompetitive. This issue is pending in the [D.C. Court  of Appeals].      That same error should not be repeated here,"" the producers and  marketers said.        The CPUC's attempt to block the Enron-El Paso contracts at the outset is  a little bit      unusual for the agency, Morris said, but it learned its lesson following  Dynegy. ""When the      Dynegy situation first hit, we asked for FERC to investigate the matter.  We thought      FERC did a very inadequate job then.....This time around we're asking  for FERC to      summarily reject it. It's hard for an agency like ours to take such a  strong stand right at      the beginning, but we've learned too much from two years of suffering  under the Dynegy      situation. And this is even worse.""        In the event the Commission should reject California's request, the CPUC  has asked that      an ""anti-hoarding condition"" be included in the contracts, which would  require Enron to      release unused capacity into the short-term market at a price higher  than what it's paying      El Paso for the capacity. ""They must make a little profit,"" Morris  noted. ""We're confident      Enron can't use the entire 1.2 Bcf/d of capacity.....so there's going to  be unused      capacity.""        The agency also wants FERC to clarify that the primary delivery point  for the Block II      portion of the capacity (579MMcf/d) is PG&E-Topock in keeping with the  terms of the      1996 settlement between El Paso and its customers. Morris said he agreed  fully with      Amoco, Burlington Resources and Southern California Gas (SoCalGas),  which accused      El Paso of violating the 1996 agreement by allowing Dynegy to use  SoCalGas-Topock as      a primary delivery point for the Block II capacity last summer. They  contend the alleged      violation is included in the Enron contracts.        He also noted the CPUC will challenge the ability of Enron to call back  Block II capacity      after it already had been recalled by El Paso shippers to serve Pacific  Gas and Electric      (PG&E) customers in northern California. Last July, FERC granted Dynegy  the right to      do this under its contracts with El Paso. But Morris contends the  decision violates the      1996 settlement under which PG&E paid $54 million to preserve the right  of the pipeline's      shippers to recall the Block II capacity to serve end-users in its  service territory.        The CPUC also intends to challenge the Commission's decision that would  enable Enron      to ""just sit on the capacity,"" thereby withholding idle Block II  capacity from the market.      Indicated Shippers also contend the Enron contracts violate the Block II  capacity      provisions of the 1996 rate case, as well as ""exacerbate"" the primary  firm delivery point      capacity-allocation issues that are pending before FERC now.        The CPUC accused El Paso of ""deliberately"" filing the Enron contracts at  FERC just      before the holidays to avoid controversy. The pipeline ""is trying to  sneak one of the most      controversial things ever past FERC right before Christmas so that  protests would be      minimized,"" said Morris. ""They did this with the Dynegy contracts two  years ago. They      have a pattern of filing right at the last minute, making it harder for  people to protest and      harder for FERC to stop it from going into effect.""     ,Copyright 1999 Intelligence Press Inc.

"On January 13, 2000, FERC issued a Section 7(c) certificate for  Transwestern's Gallup Expansion.  The Commission's order contained two  conditions:  1) that Transwestern file its discounted rates within 15 days of  the order, and 2) that Transwestern restructure its relationship with Enron  Compression Services so that Transwestern will have sufficient operation  control over the motor at the Gallup compressor station to assume regulatory  responsibility for the motor's operation, and that Transwestern file a report  with the Commission stating how it complied with this condition.   Transwestern accepted the  certificate January 14, 2000 but reserved the  right to seek rehearing or clarification of the order.  On January 18, 2000,  Transwestern filed a motion for extension of time to comply with the  condition that Transwestern file its discounted rates.  Transwestern has  already filed with the Commission the discounted rates it will charge its  expansion shippers, subject to a request for confidentiality.   Transwestern  intends to file a request for rehearing of the January 13 order explaining  why the Commission erred in ordering Transwestern to publicly disclose its  discounted rates in advance of the normal time for making such disclosure  through a discount report.

Here are some real examples that have been heard or reported:   1. From a Southwest Airlines employee: ""There may be 50 ways to leave your lover, but there are only four ways out of this plane........""  2. Pilot: ""Folks, we have reached our cruising altitude now, so I am going to switch the seat belt sign off. Feel free to move about as you wish, but please stay inside the plane till we land....it's a bit cold outside, and if you walk on the wings it affects the flight pattern.""  3. After landing: ""Thank you for flying Delta Business Express. We hope you enjoyed giving us the business as much as we enjoyed taking you for a ride.""  4. Upon landing and in the process of coming to a stop at Washington National, a lone voice comes over the loudspeaker: ""Whoa, big fella. WHOA!""  5. After a particularly rough landing with thunderstorms in Memphis, a flight attendant on a Northwest flight announced: ""Please take care when opening the overhead compartments. After a landing like that, sure as hell everything has shifted.""  6. From a Southwest Airlines employee: ""Welcome aboard Southwest Flight XXX to YYY. To operate your seatbelt, insert the metal tab into the buckle, and pull tight. It works just like every other seatbelt and if you don't know how to operate one, you probably shouldn't be out in public unsupervised. In the event of a sudden loss of cabin pressure, oxygen masks will descend from the ceiling. Stop screaming, grab the mask and pull it over your face. If you have a small child traveling with you, secure your mask before assisting with theirs. If you are traveling with two small children, decide now which one you love more.""  7. ""Weather at our destination is 50 degrees with some broken clouds, but they'll try to have them fixed before we arrive. Thank you, and remember, nobody loves you or your money more than Southwest Airlines.""  8. ""Your seat cushions can be used for flotation in the event of an emergency water landing. Please take them with our compliments.""  9. ""As you exit the plane, please make sure to gather all of your belongings. Anything left behind will be distributed evenly among the flight attendants. Please do not leave children or spouses.""  10. ""Last one off the plane must clean it.""  11. From the pilot during his welcome message: ""We are pleased to have some of the finest attendants in the industry. Unfortunately, none of them are on this flight......!""  12. Overheard on an American Airlines flight into Amarillo, Texas, on a particularly windy and bumpy day: During the final approach, the captain  was really having to fight it after an extremely hard landing. The flight attendant came on the PA and announced, ""Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Amarillo. Please remain in your seats with your seatbelts fastened while the captain taxis what's left of our airplane to the gate!""  13. A flight attendant's comment on a less than perfect landing: ""We ask  you to please remain seated as Captain Kangaroo bounces us to the terminal.""  14. An airline pilot wrote that on this particular flight he hammered his ship into the runway really hard. The airline had a policy which required the first officer to stand at the door while the passengers exited, smile, and give them a ""Thanks for flying XZY airline."" He said that in light of his bad landing, he had a hard time looking the passengers in the eye, thinking that someone would have a smart comment.  Finally, everyone had gotten off except for a little old lady walking with a cane. She said, ""Sonny, mind if I ask you a question?"" ""Why no, Ma'am,"" said the pilot, ""What is it?"" The little old lady said, ""Did we land or were we shot down?""  15. After a real crusher of a landing in Phoenix, the flight attendant came on with, ""Ladies and gentlemen, please remain in your seat until Captain Crash and the Crew have brought the aircraft to a screeching halt up against the gate. And, once the tire smoke has cleared and the warning bells are silenced, we'll open the door and you can pick your way through the wreckage to the terminal.""  16. Part of a flight attendant's arrival announcement: ""We'd like to thank you folks for flying with us today.

"Hi Mum!  Well, I mustered the courage to start my bathroom painting project  yesterday.  I chose a medium blue that looks very nice.  Guess who helped  me?  Bill!  He got pretty enthusiastic with that roller.  So we were able to  knock it out in about 3 hours.  There was a lot of woodwork to tape off.   Tonight I will finish the tub area, which needed some  repair/caulking/spackling.  Now I am anxious to do the bedroom, but probably  will not get to it until next month.  Maybe you will be able to help me  decide on a color when you are here this weekend.  I'm torn between ""Happy  Yellow"" and a lighter version of the blue I used in the bathroom.  If I  decide to paint any of the downstairs, I believe I will entrust that work to  the professionals.  Got 4 tickets to the dance performance.  Since Bill seems to genuinely enjoy  dance, I invited him.  So that leaves us with one ticket.  If you would like  to invite someone, just let me know; otherwise maybe one of my friends around  here will join us.  Hope your weekend project was a success.    Talk to you soon!

"The only problem I can see with this is that paragraph 4 could be construed  to encourage NMNG to request amendment not only to increase the MAXDTQ but  also to decrease it (if the MAXDTQ has been increased by a previous  amendment).  I worry that this might mislead NMNG that the parties can  decrease the MAXDTQ by agreement rather than NMNG using capacity release  procedures.   However, the paragraph does not obligate TW to do anything &  doesn't give NMNG any rights, since any change in the MAXDTQ must be by  mutual agreement (and it's subject to available capacity).  Since it does not  seem to give either party anything they do not already get under the tariff,  I think I would recommend we omit it.  However, NMNG might insist on this or  similar language to reflect the ""deal"" --- or at least the conversations of  the parties.  If that's the case, I suppose I would advise the marketing  folks to limit the language of paragraph 4 to an increase in MAXDTQ and  explain that any decrease would have to be thru capacity release.

"I agree with you that par. 4 doesn't give NMNG anything beyond what the  tariff and general contract law gave them.  The ""subject to agreement by  Transwestern"" language is redundant since the previous clause says "" by  mutual written agreement.""  Additionally, its confusing and innacurate  because the ""provided, however, that"" clause isn't even binding if we  mutually agree to eliminate it.   I therefore think we ought to take par. 4  out, or at least remove the ""provided however"" clause.  I don't agree that we  can only decrease their MDQ by using capacity release.  We can mutually agree  to terminate their contract or reduce their MDQ without using cap. release.   I suppose we would need to use cap. release if the termination or reduction  of their MDQ was a sham designed to get the capacity from NMNG to another  shipper, however.   I would propose one change to Par. 3 just to make the discount more clear.   The par. talks about primary delivery points but is silent on primary  receipts.  I'd add this, after the words ""Appendix A"" at the end of the  current first sentence:  ""and receipts at the primary points of receipt set forth on Appendix A.  The  discounted rate shall also apply to receipts at alternate receipt points in  Transwestern's East of Thoreau (EOT) area.""  I'm a fan of being extremely clear when we limit availability of discounts,  and think we should always fully explain what the discount applies to at both  the receipt and delivery end of the deal.    Susan, please work with Christine to get these changes made.  I'd like to  eliminate par. 4 entirely, but I can live with it if the business people want  to leave it in, as long as we eliminate the ""provided however"" clause.

"Lindy -- I'm working on a checklist. There were just a couple of issues arising from the discussions with market  services, weren't there? One having to do with whether we want to change our 68 A to reflect FTS-1 and  FTS-3 in same bucket -- I'm leaning towards not changing since the language  is already general enough to cover us there. The other issue had to do with issuing the OFO if EFBH does not show up in  the last cycle.  I do not believe any changes are necessary there either.   The tariff language as it's currently written says we ""shall"" issue an OFO,  and we would, but an OFO issued in the last cycle would simply be a formality  and the EFBH shipper would have no choice but to pay the penalty. If you see any roadblocks on these 2 tariff sheets (27A and 68A), or if there  are any other issues we need to address, let me know.  Also, if you want to  sit down and go thru my checklist together sometime tomorrow, or even later  this afternoon, I'm available. Thanks! S.

"My several hours of on-line research on this last Sept. turned up nothing on  point.  The only case that even addressed the issue of confidentiality of  contracts in a certificate context was one I'll excerpt here:  **  In Maritimes & Northeast Pipeline, L.L.C., 80 FERC P 61,346 (1997),  Maritimes requested confidentiality for the precedent agreements it  submitted. Commission staff denied the blanket request, but indicated that  Maritimes could request that specific provisions be kept confidential.  Maritimes subsequently requested that the contract terms and various cut-off  dates [FN29] in the precedent agreements be kept confidential because such  information was commercially sensitive. On the other hand, Maritimes  requested that the terms and conditions of the backstop agreements be kept  confidential, but was willing to make the contract terms of 10 and 20 years  public. Generally, the Commission will deny blanket requests for  confidentiality of agreements that are submitted to demonstrate market  support for new facilities. [FN30] However, in the instance case, the  contract terms of the backstop agreements are public and, thus, evidence of  longterm subscriptions for Maritimes proposal are in the public record and  support our finding that Maritimes has demonstrated a market for its proposed  services. Therefore, we find no compelling reason to require the length of  the terms of the other precedent agreements or the cut-off dates to be made  public.   FN29 Cut off dates refer to points in time when individual contracts could  terminate contingent on the occurrence of certain events.  FN30 See, e.g., Colorado Interstate Gas Company, 76 FERC P 61,291 (1996). **  In Amoco Production Company and Amoco Energy Trading Company V. Natural Gas  Pipeline Company of America, 82 FERC P 61,037 (1998), which involved a  request for confidentiality of a gas sales agreement, the Commission  explained why a gas sales agreement should be given confidential treatment  but transportation contracts should not:    the Commission has explicitly held that gas transportation rates stand on a  different footing from gas sales rates because pipelines and their competitors are  subject to similar disclosure requirements. In ANR Pipeline Co., the Commission explained that unlike gas  sales in a competitive market, transportation of natural gas is still regulated under  the assumption that the pipeline exercises market power. Even where transportation competition exists, that  competition is from other pipelines that are likely to be subject to similar filing and reporting  requirements.   There were several cases denying confidential treatment of rates in the  context of Section 4 cases.

"The reservation charge reduction applicable to TW's failure to deliver gas  under certain circumstances does NOT apply to either force majeure events or  periods of unscheduled maintenance less than 10 days in any calendar  quarter.  Unscheduled maintenance is defined as unanticipated or unplanned  maintenance on the pipeline system required to be performed to ensure that  gas continues to flow in months other than Dec., Jan., Feb., July and Aug.    Assuming we could even classify the proposed activity as ""maintenance,"" I'm  not sure we could get away with saying it was unanticipated or unplanned, as  the Gallup expansion has been in the works for some time.  I am also not  completely comfortable calling this ""force majeure"" because part of the  tariff definition is that the event was not within the control of either  party; however, since the definition does include ""binding order of any court  or governmental authority,"" we could possibly say this is force majeure if  we're reducing the pressure in order to comply with a DOT pipeline safety  rule.  (In that event, our notice on the EBB would be a force majeure  notice.)  If not, we can argue that since this is not ""maintenance,"" but  simply being done to construct the expansion in a safe and prudent manner,  the shippers' rights are not triggered under the reservation charge reduction  provisions.  In that case, damages (if any) would have to be pursued under  ordinary contract law.    I realize that this is not a very satisfactory answer; however, the outage is  going to be relatively short, and no shipper in recent memory has availed  itself of the reservation charge reduction.  I recommend we give shippers  reasonable notice of the pressure reduction so that they can make alternate  plans -- this will reduce the likelihood that they will feel revengeful.

" Parties represented at an informal meeting after the February 7, 2000  prehearing conference discussed circulating redlined versions of the CAC  settlement proposal as a point of departure for further settlement  conferences.  Transwestern Pipeline Company submits the following comments in  lieu of a redlined document.   Transwestern fully supports the CAC's proposal of a path-defined receipt  point structure that would define primary and secondary rights at receipt  points on the SoCalGas system. Not only does the proposal satisfy the  Commission's requirement that Hector Road be established as a formal receipt  point, it is also consistent with open and non-discriminatory access and use  of the SoCalGas system, and will help provide a reasonable degree of  certainty so that all market participants can more effectively plan gas  transportation.  CAC's proposed receipt point principles ensure that no  upstream transportation provider will unduly be denied access to SoCal's  system.   Transwestern believes that the parties may still need to address certain  details regarding implementation of the receipt point proposal that have not  been fully described in the CAC document.

This Friday  at 6:30 p.m. Pavel Kogan will be performing with the Houston Symphony at  Jones Hall.  All of the tickets for this show are being sold at a set price,  which means that we can obtain center orchestra seats for only $25.00 a  piece.  My idea for the night is as follows, attend what I'm sure will be an  outstanding performance, grab a late bite to eat at one of several excellent  restaurants downtown (Mia Bella and Osteria D'Aldo come to mind) and polish  off the evening by gracing one of the many hot-spots found downtown (Jones  Bar, Swank Lounge, Deans, Mercury Room, etc.) with our presence.  Bear in  mind that my plan is completely open to suggestions from each and every one  of you.  While I realize such an early show may interfere with some people's  plans (workout routines, etc.) I am sure things could be rearranged for one  evening.

"As you know, current firm contracts on Transwestern provide for delivery of  250 MMcf/d of gas to Topock.  In the context of the Gallup Expansion,  Transwestern has entered into firm contracts for an additional 40 MMcf/d to  Topock.  Once the Gallup expansion is built, Transwestern will have a total  of 290 MMcf/d of firm capacity under contract to the Topock delivery point:   40 MMcf/d more than PG&E has agreed to accept while PCBs continue to be  present.  Bill Cordes has asked what Transwestern's potential liability to shippers  would be if PG&E's refusal to accept deliveries due to the continued presence  of contaminants causes Transwestern to have to curtail firm service at  PG&E/Topock.  The legal answer is that Transwestern's tariff provides for a  reservation charge refund but does not limit the damages that could be sought  by a shipper.    More specifically, Rate Schedule FTS-1 specifically provides for a  reservation charge refund if Transwestern fails to deliver gas for a firm  shipper.  In December, January, February, July and August, the shipper is  entitled to a reservation charge refund for all nominated and confirmed  quantities not delivered.  In all other months, the shipper is entitled to a  refund only if deliveries fall below 75% of nominated/confirmed quantities  for a period of 75 consecutive days. The tariff does not preclude a shipper  from seeking other damages resulting from Transwestern's failure to provide  service under an FTS-1 contract.  A shipper whose firm service is curtailed  would likely incur damages in addition to the reservation charge, including,  for example, the cost of buying spot gas or damages resulting from the  shipper's inability to fulfill contractual obligations. Such damages could be  recovered in a breach of contract action.  Not all shippers would incur such  damages because some might be willing to take delivery of gas at alternate  points if capacity is available at such points.  Bill has asked Steve to work with me in quantifying our potential exposure.   I could really use your help in putting a dollar amount on potential  damages.  Can we meet briefly to discuss this?

"Christine -- Here's a brief answer to your questions.  With regard to segmentation, Order 637 is completely silent with regard to  rates to be charged for segmented capacity, so we would have considerable  leeway here.  The order is also silent with respect to the effective  restriction of segmented capacity by making discounts inapplicable to certain  alternate (or primary) points.  Hopefully TW will be able to avoid the  segmentation issue altogether by invoking the Global Settlement, as we plan  to do in our rehearing request and compliance filing.  (Our Global Settlement  argument is that we should be able to rely on tariff provisions, including  our current restriction on changing primary points, that were implemented to  mitigate the effects of turnback on TW).  On hourly service, I believe that we could put an hourly service into place  on TW without  running afoul of the Peak and Off-Peak Rates (i.e., seasonal  rates) provisions of the order.  In other words, I think the Commission would  see them as two separate kinds of service.  As for how to communicate with our customers, I believe Regulatory has  offered to have a meeting with TW customers in early April to make a  presentation on Order 637 and provide a forum for discussion.  I realize the  order becomes effective March 27; however, compliance filings are not due  until May 1, and some requirements do not even become effective until  September 1.  Before the beginning of April, the GPG pipelines will simply  not have their positions fully formed enough to make a very well-organized  presentation to persons outside the company.  The meeting is still in the  planning stages and I will fill you in on details as they are available.  In  the meantime, if your customers have questions, I'll be happy to help answer  them.

Here are a couple of items that I need  additional clarification on:  1)  Segmentation -  You summarized "" Pipelines must allow segmentation to the  extend operationally feasible and cannot hide behind current tariff  provisions ...  ""    Does this mean, for example, an Ignacio to California  contract (i.e. 40,000 Dth/d at a $.20 total path rate) could be segmented by  the shipper such that on any single day they could nom 40 MM/d from Ignacio  to El Paso Blanco as well as 40 MM/d from Blanco to California?  If they  could, would the $.20 apply to each segment such that we could bill them 80  MM/d ($.20) for the time period that they flowed on a segmented basis or  would they only pay the $.20 applied to the contract's 40 MM/d MDQ?       Another scenario would be if the shipper is allowed to flow based on this  segmented basis, but unless the discount letter providing the $.20  specifically provides for a negotiated segmented transport rate the shipper  will be billed MAX rate for some or both of the segmentated paths (?) if  these paths are not already provided as ""alternate"" receipt or delivery  paths?    2)  Peak & OFF-Peak Rates. - You summarized "" The policy does not apply to  long-term shippers with contracts for 12 or more consective months of  service.""      TW will eventually file for hourly rates, however, the parties most  interested in this service will be marketers serving a generation station, or  the generation station's own gas supply manager/purchaser.  Most likely these  contracts WILL BE of a longer term nature than month to month or even  seasonal.  I need to reconcile your summarized comment to what we will expect  from the marketplace.  Thanks for your feedback.  Since 637 is effective March 27th, I am eager to  be able to speak intelligently to my customers regarding some of these more  critical issues.  Thanks.

Maria Pavlou 03/06/2000 04:39 PM To: Drew Fossum/ET&S/Enron@ENRON cc: Susan Scott/ET&S/Enron@ENRON   Subject: Re: Gas Sales on TW?    FYI a little more background:    The Amgas relationship began as a result of TW's efforts to unbundle under  Order No. 636, whereby we assigned gas purchase contracts to Amgas.  In  addition, we had them administer certain remaining gas purchase contracts as  well as our de minimus sales function.  All Amgas does today is administer  our sales function.  We never eliminated our sales function; we just  transferred the administration of it to Amgas.    The marketing affiliate rule requires that a pipeline's sales division be  treated as a functional equivalent of a marketing affiliate.   Our standards  of conduct provide that the Vice President of Finance and Accounting is  advised of pertinent sales activities by Amgas but does not participate in  any of the day-to-day operations of Transwestern's merchant function.  As a  result, the VP is not a shared operating employee under Standard G.  FTS-2  transportation service is the unbundled no-notice transportation service the  (former and current) sales customers received under Order No.  636.   I think  we should be able to file revised standards saying that the merchant function  is even smaller than it was when we unbundled [true?] which is not enough  work for an agent to perform and that we've brought it back in house and  explain why the person with the sales function responsibility is not a shared  operating employee under G.

This sounds like a good candidate for a waiver application to FERC.  If we  can save the $60,000/yr, it would be worth asking FERC for authority to  simply use an ET&S market services person to administer the farm tap sales  from time to time, without any functional separation or other junk.  We could  even list the specific sales contracts we have so FERC would be comfortable  that we are not going to expand the business.  The NN situation was different  (I think) because NN had formally notified FERC that it was discontinuing use  of its sales rate schedule.  Would TW use the FTS-2 rate schedule?  We have  never formally discontinued the TW sales function, right?   What do you guys  think about the likelihood that FERC would approve such a waiver?  Has it  ever approved similar small-volume waivers?

I've been asked to look into whether TW may administer its farm tap sales  contracts directly or whether we need to continue to use AmGas.  TW no longer  has any gas purchase contracts, just a handful of sales contracts to persons  who granted rights of way to TW.  Many of these parties don't even buy gas on  a regular basis, but they still have the contractual right to do so.  We pay  AmGas around $60,000/year to administer the contracts.  The AmGas contract is  terminable on 30 days notice.  I know that last year NNG re-established its pipeline sales division to make  occasional gas sales and for other economic reasons (i.e. the base gas  deal).  Do you think it would be worthwhile for TW to do the same?  Looks  like NNG had an easy time getting its filing approved, but would like to hear  from you what all was involved behind the scenes -- in other words, was it as  easy as it looked?    Another idea that Maria suggested would be to apply to the Commission to  waive the Section 284.286 requirements in this instance since the remaining  sales contracts are so few and insignificant.

"With regard to the Commission's limitations on the right of first refusal,  Order 637 provides for grandfathering of discounted long-term contracts that  are now subject to ROFR.

The TW Commercial Group has asked whether we  should challenge the grandfathering of existing contracts.

"Lorraine:  here's what we would have to show FERC, along with some of my  comments.  Let me know if you have additional ideas, and I'll turn it into a  draft to send around to the usual suspects.    1.  Rate impact on TW customers; method by which TW would collect the costs  of the acquired capacity.     -  I assume TW would be at risk for any undercollection of revenue  associated with the PNM capacity; thus there is no cost-shift potential to  other shippers.    - Net costs will be separately recorded.  2.  Would acquisition of PNM capacity enable TW to gain control over access  to upstream capacity and supply sources in a manner which would permit TW to  limit customer choices or improperly tie use of the acquired capacity to  other pipeline services?  (I think Mary Kay will be able to help us explain  the ""no tying"" part).  3.  Would TW's marketing affiliates receive preferential treatment?     - No TW marketing affiliate will be involved in the proposed transaction  - Acquisition of PNM capacity will not result in any undue preference or  advantage to any affiliated entity.  4.  Will TW as a holder of capacity receive preferential treatment over PNM's  customers, to the detriment of PNM's customers?     - No.  PNM will be making the capacity available to TW only during periods  in which it has unused capacity available on its system, so any impact on PNM  shippers should be minimal.    - Service contract under PNM's tariff does not provide for unduly  preferential treatment of TW.  5.  How will capacity be managed or otherwise integrated into TW's existing  open access operations?     - TW will enter into service agreements with PNM from time to time to  transport gas on the portion of PNM's line from Blanco, NM (i.e., the Blanco  Hub operated by TW) to Rio Puerco, NM, where PNM's system interconnects with  TW's mainline.  Resulting available capacity will be posted according to TW's  tariff.    - The capacity will be used to serve customers under TW's FTS-1, LFT and ITS  (right?) rate schedules from the Blanco receipt point to delivery points on  TW's system.    - Lorraine -- we need to discuss our arrangement with PNM -- Would we be  able to acquire on an as-needed basis?  Would it be an ordinary service  agreement as provided in their tariff?  Which would come first, our deal with  PNM or with our shipper?  It might be good to come up with some examples of  likely scenarios.  6.  Would acquisition of PNM capacity prevent unnecessary construction of new  facilities?     - Yes.  Demand currently exceeds available capacity on the San Juan  Lateral.  Transwestern was unable to construct San Juan Phase II because of  prohibitively high costs of obtaining an easement on Navajo land.  Using the  PNM Blanco to Rio Puerco line is one of the few remaining alternatives  available to TW to expand this portion of its system.  It would enable TW to  transport an additional ______ of gas for shippers from the San Juan Basin to  delivery points on the mainline of TW's system without the need for expanding  the San Juan lateral.  The acquired capacity would benefit customers by  effectively providing incremental capacity on a constrained portion of TW's  system, at minimal cost to TW and no environmental disturbance.  Would enable  both TW and PNM to use their systems more efficiently. ",lorraine.lindberg@enron.com,susan.scott@enron.com,Acquisition of PNM capacity,2000-03-08 06:54:00-08:00,sent

My point is that if we are already contracting for daily firm this way, it  should not matter whether the discount is effective for one month or for 12  months.    If there is a problem with the current arrangement, we should discuss it.   Nothing about the way we do these deals has changed since we discussed it  last December.

This phrasing is of course misleading; TW's daily  firm contracts are always for a term of just one day, but renew for  consecutive one-day terms unless terminated.  The discount letter, on the  other hand, grants a discounted rate for each of the one-day terms for a  certain period of time (typically one month).  Steve Harris wants to be able  to ""sell daily firm for a one-year period.""  In contractual terms all this  would mean is that the contract is for renewabable one-day terms (as usual),  and the discount applicable to such terms would be effective for one year.  I  see no problem with this, do you?  (Apparently the current perception in  marketing is that regulatory/legal was limiting daily firm to a 3-month  period.)

"Part II:  FERC Writing Handbook  1.  ""WHEREFORE, PREMISES CONSIDERED"" adds a note of authority to your  pleadings.  In fact, some administrative law judges will throw your pleading  into the special incinerator marked ""Nonconforming Pleadings"" (located on the  west side of the FERC building) unless such language is present.  2.  Pronouns should be used sparingly, if at all.  With few exceptions,  parties must always be named to avoid confusion, even if it means the name of  the party will appear several times in one sentence.  3.  The verb ""request"" may not be used without the word ""to.""  Example:   ""Pipeline X respectfully requests the Commission to grant its motion.""  4.  ""In regards to"" or ""vis-a-via"" sound more intelligent than ""about"" or  ""concerning.""  5.  If you are not sure you've conveyed an important point effectively,  repeat the statement verbatim at various other points in your pleading for  emphasis.  Additionally, repeating a contractual provision several times in a  contract will give your client greater rights than if you only include the  provision once.  6.  Always recite the entire history of the proceeding in your pleading  before stating the purpose of your pleading.  No FERC staffer ever remembers  what happens, and the added pages will make your pleading really impressive.  7.  When in doubt, insert more commas.

This would effectively operate as an  expansion of TW's system from the San Juan Basin to the mainline.  TW would  acquire PNM capacity then post it as available on the EBB just like we post  other capacity.  Shippers could then use the capacity to transport gas from  Blanco to any point on TW's system.   The capacity that PNM has available at  this time is seasonal (summer months) only, so it would be used to provide  short-term firm capacity or LFT to TW customers.   The marketers anticipate  that the additional capacity would mostly be used to ship gas to points on  TW's mainline besides Rio Puerco -- in other words, the total path used by  shippers would be a combination of PNM's system and TW's system.  Shippers  wouldn't necessarily know whether PNM capacity was being used to provide  service on their contract, only that their gas is being shipped from A to B.    In re-reading the Texas Eastern line of cases, I believe we can distinguish  TW's proposal from that in Northern's Docket No. 97-388 because it is more  specific (we are asking for authority to acquire capacity on a specific  pipeline) and because it is more in the nature of an expansion of TW's  constrained San Juan lateral rather than a proposal to broker other  pipelines' capacity.  I may be overly optimistic, but I also believe we meet  all the Texas Eastern criteria.  I realize that I have not discussed this very extensively (or at all) with  any of you, but I have gone ahead and drafted the proposal in the form of a  letter to FERC.  It seemed the most efficient way to provide a starting point  for discussion, especially since I was able to borrow heavily from our  successful Market Center Services filing.

The purpose of my changes was to (i)  apportion the risk assumed by TW and Calpine based on the economic benefits  realized by the parties and the ability of a party to insure against the  risk, and (ii) to clearly identify the parts of the facilities to be serviced  by TW and the list of services routinely performed.  I noticed that there is  no insurance  coverage  required of either Party.  I expect that Calpine  insures its property against casualties and is therefore in the best position  to assume the risk of loss or damage to its property.   On the other-hand,  third party property that is in the care, custody and control of TW while it  performs its work, is not covered by Enron's standard general liability  policies.  Builder's risk  coverage must be purchased to cover this risk; the  coverage is expensive.  Section 5.4 and Section 4.1 reflect this reasoning.   If TW plans to limit its financial responsibility to the amount of money  collected by Customer from TW's insurance carriers, then an Insurance section  should be included, and the penultimate sentence of Section 5.4 further  edited to stipulate that limitation.  If TW's limitation of liability is to  be a percentage of the total amount of revenues and compensation it receives  under this transaction, then that dollar-amount should be inserted in the  latter mentioned sentence of Section 5.4.

"The Commercial Group asked several weeks ago whether they can enter into  discount letters applicable to daily firm for as long as one year.  The  standard wording of the discount letter applicable to daily firm is such that  the discount is effective for as many one-day terms as the FTS-1 agreement  renews, but not beyond a specified date.  Typically TW enters into these  discount letters for a term of one month.  The marketers say that they were  once told that they could not make such a discount applicable for longer than  a 3-month term.   I see no basis for this limitation.  The term of the FTS-1  agreement is one day, renewable from day to day.  The discount is only  applicable for so long as the FTS-1 agreement renews.  If the FTS-1 agreement  does not renew, the discount is no longer applicable.  The basis for the  shipper's transportation rights is the FTS-1 agreement.  We are not  guaranteeing a shipper ""daily"" firm for longer than a one-day term.  The  discount letter merely states that, for so long as the FTS-1 agreement  renews, a particular discount applies, up to a certain cutoff date. Does this make sense?  I realize you are swamped, but I need to get Steve an  answer so that the marketers know what is acceptable.  Drew and I have  discussed this and he is on board.

"Susan, Attached is the text I am forwarding to the investors.  Please let me  know if you have any comments.  Thanks for your help.   I talked further with Transwestern Counsel today concerning the issues and  have the following points;   1.  FERC was made aware of the Compression Services arrangement with ECS (at  that time via Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp.) in the filings for the  certification of the Kachina units.  FERC simply didn't ask any further  questions in that proceeding.  The Operation & Maintenance Agreements in  place for the Kachina units essentially accomplishes the same things as the  Operational Control Agreement in Gallup.  TW feels the O&M agreements would  be adequate to answer any questions that possibly FERC might ask regarding  this subject matter.  The Operational Control agreement was put into place in  Gallup because it was thought to be easier to give FERC exactly what is was  looking for rather than show them the Gallup O&M Agreement which might slow  down the process at that time.   2.  There is no basis in FERC Regs or the NGA for FERC to impose any type of  penalty or discontinue the Compression Service's due to TW's operation of  Kachina without the Operational Control Agreement.  No regs or law address  this situation.  Again this is tempered by the fact that FERC was made aware  of the arrangement and didn't ask any questions and the O&M agreement is in  place to accomplish control for TW.   3.  I also faxed you a copy of Section 19(c) of the NGA which indicates that  the petition for rehearing does effect the status of the certificate.   Construction is moving ahead and the anticipated start date is May 1.    I will forward the filing TW made wrt to the Operational Control Agreement as  soon as I recieve it.

"Main Entry: al?tru?ism Pronunciation: 'al-tru-""i-z&m Etymology: French altruisme, from autrui other people, from Old French,  oblique case form of autre other, from Latin alter Date: 1853 1 : unselfish regard for or devotion to the welfare of others  We got to talking about you at lunch today.  Rudy mentioned that in effort to  get your goat he often tells you your not being very altruistic towards him  by consuming so much of his time requesting reports.  My understanding is that your  typical response to this is ""I am the most altruistic person.""  I am sure you  recognize the hypocrisy  laden in this statement.  If a true altruist is unselfish then he would not  care if his acts are recognized or not.  In fact, the true altruist hopes  only that his acts benefit those to which they are directed.  We may have to downgrade you to ""concerned  individual"".                         But given your good-hearted and idealistic leanings I thought you would might  like to know that the Landmark River Oaks Theatre is going to be showing Mr.  Smith  Goes to Washington Saturday and Sunday at 10:00 a.m.  If you haven't seen the  film it's a black and white starring Jimmy Stewart as an idealistic,  extremely unselfish young man who takes on the corrupt political machines of Washington, D.C.   The film ranked 29th on AFI's (The American Film Institute) top 100 films of  the Century list, and is tied for first place on the Sscott5 Greatest Films List..

"Supposedly my phone is going to be switched over the weekend so I should be  back in the world of reachable individuals next week.  I'm glad you  appreciated my observation rather than taking offence.  I was afraid after  two weeks of silence I may have pissed you off somehow, in which case that  last email would have  probably been the final nail in the coffin.    As far as the new job goes it is looking very promising.  Turns out my trader  went to college with my brother-in-law, sister, and brother so we have too  many mutual connections for him to be mean or rude to me.  Even without the  connections he seems like a pretty cool guy and is very supportive of my  learning all I can about his book.  Hopefully, after I get the daily routine  down he'll let me sit with him during the down times and watch him work.  You should definitely try and see the film Saturday and even if you can't  pull yourself out of bed you should rent it, I really think you would  enjoy/be inspired by it (at least I am every time I watch it).  I hope things  are well with you although I am sensing some disenchantment.  If that is the  case I can give you a few tips on how to overcome and once again appreciate  your current position in life.  Believe me over the last two months I have  had ample opportunity to do just that.  Just let me know if I can return the  favour you once did for me.    Have fun at y'alls Happy Hour tonight.  P.S.

You see,  Transwestern is a formal party to the GIR proceeding.  As such, we are  currently involved (albeit indirectly) in negotiations with SoCal and other  parties regarding the ability [and mechanism] for SoCal to recover costs to  implement unbundled services on their system.  System pooling is one of those  services.    I'll defer to counsel on this, but in my humble opinion, I don't think it  wise for TW to offer SoCal any kind of cost figure to base its estimates on.   First, its probably not good form for one party to the proceeding to give  another party information that could prove to be prejudicial.  Secondly, and  probably more practically, if Transwestern were of a mind to, it could  intentionally skew the results of their survey.   Unless collective wisdom feels differently, I'd suggest we politely decline  on some reasonably nebulous basis, i.e. --- we don't know... we forgot.... we  really didn't account for it separately... it's been too long.... the people  who might have known are no longer here... whatever.   That way we don't  appear uncooperative, just incompetent!    I'm kidding.  Just let me know how else I can help here.

The family members sat silent as they absorbed the news.  At length, someone asked, ""Well, how much does a brain cost?""  The doctor quickly responded, ""$200,000 for a female brain, and $500,000 for a male brain."" The moment turned awkward. Men in the room tried not to smile, avoiding eye contact with the women, but some actually smirked.  A girl, unable to control her curiosity, blurted out the question everyone wanted to ask, ""Why is the male brain so much more?""  The doctor  smiled at her childish innocence and then to the entire group said, ""It's a standard pricing procedure.  We have  to mark the female brains down, because they're used.""

"Hi Mum!  No, tickets were hard to come by.  Tried to get some they released a  couple of weeks ago, but didn't realize everyone would send their secretaries  and interns downstairs to hold places in line!  I'm sure the VPs will get  tired of going to the games, and start giving tickets away.   Tonight is the big CAM gala.  Bill was in trial all week and had no time to  go shopping, or even to get measured for an ordinary tux rental, so he  borrowed one from Andre (who owns 4).  Andre is a couple of inches shorter  than Bill.  Depending on the overall look, I may or may not acknowledge that  Bill is my date.  My 60's dress I got at Wear It Again Sam looks fabulous.   It is a sleeveless gown with an empire waist; the top is maroon velvet and  the rest is very heavy pink satin.  Since it wraps in the back I was able to  move the hooks over to get it to fit.  Dress was $38 but it cost $35 to get  it hemmed!  Ann and I were considering asking Mema to do our hair, but I'm  really going to be pressed for time this afternoon.  Too bad the party is not  on a Saturday.  Our plans for the rest of this weekend are still up in the air.  What are you  doing the weekend of the 16th?  Bill has signed up for the MS150 again that  weekend.  If you are free that weekend why don't I plan to come either Fri.  or Sat. a.m.  Let me know.  Our law conference begins Thurs. a.m. in San Antonio.  Dot (Staci's boss) is  having a party at her house on Lake McQueeney on Wednesday, so I'm driving  Frazier and Tony in the Dentmobile that morning.  We really do have a fun  group; it should be a good time.  If K&J want company I'll drive over to see  them on Thurs. night instead of going to the awards dinner, which was a big  drag last year.  I'll call them this weekend and see what Jim's travel plans  are.  Today we'll find out about settlement in the California proceeding...this  will decide whether I will be tied up in hearings for most of May.  Keep your  fingers crossed!  Love, Sooz      Camp2scott@aol.com on 03/31/2000 09:08:17 AM To: Susan.Scott@enron.com cc:    Subject: ballpark   Hi, Sooz--Big article about the Enron ballpark today--did the company treat you to the opening?  I'm up to my ears in jobs around the house in preparation for Eric's visit. It's always a good thing to have company--you get all kinds of things done you should have done a long time ago.  I painted half of my bedroom last night, and the other half will have to wait until I decide what to do with the windows.  But, I needed to paint over the patch on the fireplace wall, and the holes left by the blinds I took down ages ago.  Didn't know what color I had used, so I chose a new one.  You can't really tell that I've stopped at the corners.  Jim is still unsure about his business trip rescheduled and rescheduled for next week, the 4th and 5th.  I'm hoping it's canceled because Karin asked if I would come, and that really puts me in a bind with Eric coming in on the 6th as far as cooking, and last minute things.  Sally is coming on the 8th, so if the trip is postponed until that week, she'll be around.  Are you still going to SA for your continuing ed?  Did I tell you I bought 4 rocking chairs for the back porch?  They're not as comfortable as I thought they'd be.

"Now that two settlement proposals and a motion to extend time have been  filed, there is no telling what the CPUC will do.  My recommendation is that  we play it safe and assume we will need to file testimony on April 17.  To  that end, it's time to review some basics.  In its July 8, 1999 decision, the Commission stated:  ""We see reason to  pursue a change in protocol for receiving gas at Hector Road, even in the  short term.  If there are burdens that would unfairly fall upon Transwestern  customers is a window was established at Hector Road, we want to hear about  it in the next phase of the proceeding.  In addition, we seek specific  proposals as to how such an arrangement should be defined.""  Accordingly, the testimony we file should explain:  1.  The unfair harm that could potentially befall TW customers if Hector Road  were established as a formal receipt point 2.   Our proposal for making Hector a formal receipt point by establishing  primary and secondary receipt points 3.  Why our proposal is fair and consistent with Commission policy (here we  might want to draw analogies to the interstate system and explain why that  works)  I will also have an opportunity to make legal and policy arguments in a brief  after testimony has been filed.  Let's discuss how best to go about drafting the testimony.  I think the best  thing to do would be to outline the testimony, then decide who is going to  say what.

"---------------------- Forwarded by Susan M Scott/HOU/ECT on 04/06/2000 06:24  PM ---------------------------           RE:     Southern Advice  ADVICE TO NORTHERNERS MOVING SOUTH:  The following is a pre-approved posting whose purpose is to offer insight and advice to Northerners moving South.  1.  Save all manner of bacon grease. You will be instructed on how to use it shortly. 2.  Just because you can drive on snow and ice does not mean Southerners can. Stay home the two days of the year it snows. 3.  If you do run your car into a ditch, don't panic.  Four men in the cab of a four-wheel pick-up with a 12-pack of beer and a tow chain will be along shortly. Don't try to help them. Just stay out of their way. This is what they live for. 4.  You can ask Southerners for directions, but unless you already know the positions of key hills, trees and rocks, you're better off trying to find it yourself. 5.  Remember: ""Y'all is singular.""  ""All y'all is plural."" All y'all's is plural possessive."" 6. Get used to hearing, ""You ain't from around here, are you?"" 7.  Don't be worried that you don't understand anyone. They don't understand you, either. 8.  The first Southern expression to creep into a transplanted Northerner's vocabulary is the adjective ""big ol,"" as in ""big ol truck,"" or ""big ol boy."" 9.  As you are cursing the person driving 15 mph in a 55-mph zone, directly in the middle of the road, remember: ALL Southern folks learned to drive on a John Deere, and this is the proper speed and lane position for that vehicle. 10. If you hear a Southerner exclaim, ""Hey, y'all, watch this!"" Stay out of his way. These are likely the last words he will ever say, or worse still, that you will ever hear. 11. Most Southerners do not use turn signals; they ignore those who do. In fact, if you see a signal blinking on a car with a Southern license plate, you may rest assured that it was already turned on when the car was purchased. 12. If it can't be fried in bacon grease, it ain't worth cooking, let alone eating. 13. The wardrobe you always brought out in September can wait until December. 14. If there is the prediction of the slightest chance of even the most minuscule accumulation of snow, your presence is required at the local grocery store. It does not matter if you need anything from the store. It is just something you're supposed to do. 15. Satellite dishes are very popular in the South. When you purchase one,it is positioned directly in front of the house. This is logical, bearing in mind that the dish cost considerably more than the house, and should, therefore, be prominently displayed. 16.  Be advised that in the South, ""He needed killin'"" is a valid defense.   ========================== End Part 2 ============================= ","tobin.carlson@enron.com, daniel.falcone@enron.com,   benjamin.freeman@enron.com, nicholas.stephan@enron.com,   sunil.dalal@enron.com",susan.scott@enron.com,Fwd: Southern Advice,2000-04-06 11:26:00-07:00,sent

The ALJ assigned to the GIR case, Andrea  Biren, has apparently issued a ruling on SoCal's Motion to Extend the  deadline for filing the all-party settlement.   Although I personally haven't  seen the document yet, it was the primary focus of the meeting.  According to accounts from the group, Judge Biren's ruling did not grant  SoCal's motion for extension.  Rather, she will hear arguments on the motion  during the Prehearing Conference scheduled for Tuesday, April 11.  Judge  Biren also asked that parties to the proceeding be prepared to file full  scale testimony discussing all settlement proposals on file as well as offer  any addtional comments on the most promising options set forth by the  Commission.  Unfortunately, she is silent on what date the testimony would be  due (originally, testimony was due on April 17).  In addition, Judge Biren's  ruling apparently leaves open the possibility that she could be talked into  something different during Tuesday's prehearing conference (ie. a different  procedural schedule, or an amended or streamlined testimony filing protocol).  The telecon group decided to do the following: (1) approach CPUC commissioner  Bilas on Monday and let him know the status of the all-party settlement and  ask him to intervene in favor of the extension, (2) go before Judge Biren on  Tuesday (as a group, and individually, if necessary) and request that in leiu  of a full scale testimony procedure, would she accept a process whereby,  similar to what was done in the PG&E settlement, parties file declarations in  favor of one settlement versus another, and then the Judge  supervises/conducts a panel discussion on the issues surrounding the  settlement?  If Judge Biren rejects the idea of a less formal process, one  which arguably doesn't offer as complete a record in the case (which most on  the call felt was the likely outcome), then would she agree to a schedule  whereby she grants the SoCal motion, the all-party settlement is filed on  April 17, then all parties, including the Norm Pedersen group, would have the  chance to file testimony (only testimony, not additional declarations)  indicating support of one settlement over another and the reasons/logic,  including how the settlements meet the Commisision objectives, on or before  May 5?  As far as the all-party settlement document is concerned, SoCal will be  forwarding a preliminary (as yet incomplete) draft for the parties to review,  but not to comment on.  SoCal intends to circulate another, more complete  version Monday morning for purposes of soliciting comments/changes.

"The quote speaks to so many in such personal ways...Obviously you identified  with it's message.  Although, I'm not sure about the Dalai Lama comment as he  does believe in a power higher than himself.  As for myself...  I am still measuring my powers.  They seem to lie in such varied arenas that  I never know what I will discover day-to-day.  As far as tasting the fruits of my passion, you know what they say...the  first bite is the sweetest.  And I must say I look forward with great  anticipation to sitting down at the table when the time is right.  My place in the world is a combination of one of the guys and the ever  idealistic, eternal optimist (i.e. I see what is and yet still hold out hope  for more).  * I don't believe the sentiment in Return to Me was pure fiction.

"Interesting.  I seem to remember that under Texas law, everything goes to the  surviving spouse.  Any community property issues between Greg and ex should  have been settled in the divorce proceedings.  But it's been a while since I  looked -- I will ask Bill for a second opinion.    In any event, a will is a good idea, especially when kids are involved.  If,  God forbid, the worst should happen, you can bet that ex + kids would make  life even more difficult for you in what would already be a tough time!  Bill  doesn't do wills but he could probably recommend someone who would do a will  for cheap.

Awesome day. Not a single cloud in the sky. About 70 degrees. 11:55 I decide that we're going to kick the shit out of Nebraska. 11:56 I tell my first Nebraska fan to go fuck himself. 12:15 The UT band walks by on the way to the Alamodome. We're on the second floor of a two-story parking garage on the corner (a couple hundred of us). We're hooting and hollering like wildmen. The band doubles back to the street right below us and serenades us with Texas Fight and The Eyes of Texas. AWESOME MOMENT. 12:25 In the post-serenade serendipity, 50-100 grown men are bumping chests with one another, each and every one of them now secure and certain of the fact that we are going to kick the shit out of Nebraska. 1:00 The Nebraska band walks by on the way to the Alamodome. Again, we hoot and holler like wildmen. Again, the band doubles back and stops right below us to serenade us, this time, however, with the Nebraska fight songs. *Although somewhat impressed by their spirit and verve, we remain convinced that we are going to kick the shit out of Nebraska. 1:30 I begin the walk to the Alamodome, somehow managing to stuff the ""Traveler"" and 11 cans of beer into my pants. 1:47 I am in line surrounded by Nebraska fans. They are taunting me. I am taunting back, still certain that we are going to kick the shit out of Nebraska. I decide to challenge a particularly vocal Nebraska fan to play  what I now call and will forever be remembered as ""Cell-Phone Flop Out."" Remember flop out for a dollar? The rules are similar. I tell this Nebraska jackass that if he's so confident in his team, he should ""flop out"" his cell  phone RIGHT NOW and make plane reservations to Phoenix for the Fiesta Bowl.  And then I spoke these memorable words: ""And not those damn refundable tickets, either! You request those non-refundable, non-transferrable sons-of-bitches!"" He backs down. He is unworthy. I call Southwest Airlines and buy two tickets to Phoenix, non-refundable and non-transferrable. Price:  $712. He is humbled. He lowers his head in shame. I raise my cell phone in  triumph to the cheers of hundreds of Texas fans. I am KING and these are my  subjects. I distribute the 11 beers in my pants to the cheering masses. I  RULE the pre-game kingdom. 2:34 Kickoff. Brimming with confidence, I open the Traveler and pour my first stiffy. 2:45 I notice something troubling: Nebraska is big. Nebraska is fast. Nebraska is very pissed off at Texas. 3:01 The first quarter mercifully ends. 9 yards total offense for Texas. Zero first downs for Texas. I'm still talking shit. I pour another stiffy  from the Traveler. 3:36 Four minutes to go in the first half: the Traveler is a dead soldier.  I buy my first $5 beer from the Alamodome merchants. While I am standing in line, a center snap nearly decapitates Major Applewhite and rolls out of the end zone. Safety. 3:56 Halftime score: Nebraska 15, Texas 0. I wish I had another Traveler. 4:11 While urinating next to a Nebraska fan in the bathroom at halftime, I attempt to revive the classic Brice-ism from the South Bend bathroom: ""Hey, buddy, niiiiiiiiice cock."" He is unamused. 4:21 I buy my 2nd and 3rd $5 beer from the Alamodome merchants. I share my beer with two high school girls sitting behind me. Surprisingly, they are equipped with a flask full of vodka. I send them off to purchase Sprites, so that we may consume their vodka. I have not lost faith.  Nebraska is a bunch of pussies. 4:51 No more vodka. The girls sitting behind me have fled for their lives.  I purchase two more $5 beers from the Alamodome merchants. 5:18 Score is Nebraska 22, Texas 0. I am beginning to lose faith. This normally would trouble me, but I am too drunk to see the football field. 5:27 I call Southwest Airlines: ""I'm sorry, sir. Those tickets have been confirmed and are non-refundable and non-transferrable."" 5:37 I try to start a fight with every person behind the concession counter. As it turns out, the Alamodome has a policy that no beer can be sold when there is less than 10 minutes on the game clock. I am enraged by this policy. I ask loudly: ""Why the fuck didn't you announce last call over the fucking PA system??!!"" 5:49 Back in my seats, I am slumped in my chair in defeat. All of a sudden, the Texas crowd goes absolutely nuts. ""Whazzis?,"" I mutter, awaking from my coma, ""Iz we winnig? Did wez scort?"" Alas, the answer is no, we were not winning and we did not score. The largest (by far) cheer of the day from the Texas faithful occurred when the handlers were walking back to the tunnel and Bevo stopped to take a gargantuan shit all over the letters ""S"", ""K"", and ""A"" in the ""Nebraska"" spelled out in their end zone.  I cheer wildly.  I pick up the empty Traveler bottle and stick my tongue in it. I am thirsty. 6:16 Nebraska fans are going berserk as I walk back to the truck. I would taunt them with some off-color remarks about their parentage, but I am too drunk to form complete sentences. With my last cognitive thought of the evening, I take solace in the fact that if we had not beaten them in October, they would be playing Florida State for the national championship. 6:30 Back in the car. On the way back to Austin for the 8:00 Texas-Arizona tip off. We can still salvage the day! I crack open a beer.  *It is warm.  I don't care. 7:12 We have stopped for gas. I am hungry. I go inside the store. I walk past the beer frig. I notice a Zima. I've never had a Zima. I wonder if it's any good. I pull a Zima from the frig. I twist the top off and drink the Zima in three swallows. Zima sucks. I replace the empty bottle in the frig. 7:17 There is a Blimpie Subs in the store. I walk to where the ingredients are, where the person usually makes the sub. There is no one there. I lean over the counter and scoop out half a bucket of black olives. I eat them.  I am still hungry. I lean further over the counter and grab approximately two pounds of Pastrami. I walk out of the store grunting and eating Pastrami. The patrons in the store fear me. I don't care. 8:01 We are in South Austin. I have been drinking warm beer and singing Brooks and Dunn tunes for over an hour. My truck-mate is tired of my singing. He suggests that perhaps Brooks and Dunn have written other good songs besides ""You're Going to Miss Me When I'm Gone"" and ""Neon Moon"" and that maybe listening to only those two songs, ten times each was a bit excessive. Perhaps, he suggests, I could just let the CD play on its own.  I tell him to fuck off and restart ""Neon Moon."" 8:30 We arrive at the Erwin Center. My truckmate, against my loud and profane protestations, parks on the top floor of a nearby parking garage.  I tell him he's an idiot. I tell him we will never get out. I tell him we may as well pitch a fucking tent here. He ignores me. I think he's still pissed about the Brooks and Dunn tunes. I whistle ""Neon Moon"" loudly. 8:47 I am rallying. I have 4 warm beers stuffed in my pants. We're going to kick the shit out of Arizona. 9:11 Halftime score: Texas 31, Arizona 29. I am pleased. I go to the bathroom to pee for the 67th time today. I giggle to myself because of the new opportunity to do ""the bathroom Brice."" There are no Arizona fans in the bathroom. I am disappointed. I tell myself (out loud) that I have a ""Niiiiiice cock."" No one is amused but me. 9:41 I walk to the bathroom while drinking Bud Light out of a can.  Needless to say, they do not sell beer at the Erwin Center,much less Bud Light out  of a can. I am stopped by an usher: ""Where did you get that, sir?"" I tell him (no shit): ""Oh, the cheerleaders were throwing them up with those little plastic footballs. Would you mind throwing this away for me?"" I take the last swig and hand it to him. He is confused. I pretend I'm going to the bathroom, but I run away giggling instead. I duck into some entrance to avoid the usher, who is now pursuing me. I sneak into a large group of people and sit down. The usher walks by harmlessly. I am giggling like a little girl. I crack open another can of Bud Light. 9:52 I am lost. In my haste to avoid the usher, I have lostmy bearings. I have no ticket stub. I cannot find my seats. Texas is losing. 10:09 Texas is being screwed by the refs. I am enraged. I have cleared out the seats around me because I keep removing my hat and beating the surrounding chairs with it. A concerned fan asks if I'm OK and perhaps I shouldn't take it so seriously. I tell him to fuck off. 10:15 After the fourth consecutive ""worst fucking call I have EVER seen,"" I attempt to remove my hat again to begin beating inanimate objects.  However, on this occasion I miscalculate and I thumbnail myself in my left eyelid, leaving a one-quarter inch gash over my eye. I am now bleeding into my left eye and all over my shirt. ""Perhaps,"" I think to myself, ""I'm taking this a bit seriously."" 10:22 I am standing in the bathroom peeing. I'm so drunk I am swaying and grunting. I have a bloody napkin pressed on my left eye. My pants are bloody. I have my (formerly) white shirt wrapped around my waist. I look like I should be in an episode of Cops. 10:43 Texas has lost. I put my bloody white shirt back on my body and make my way for the exits. I am stopped every 20 seconds by a good samaritan/cop/security guard to ask me why I am covered in blood, but I merely grunt incoherently and keep moving. 10:59 With my one good eye, I have located the parking garage. I walk up six flights of stairs, promise that when I see my friend I will punch him in the face for making me walk up six flights of stairs, find the truck, and collapse in a heap in the bed of the truck. I look around and notice that traffic is lined up all the way around the garage, six whole flights, and  no one is moving. I take a nap. 11:17 I awake from my nap. I see my friend in the driver's seat. I lift my head to look out the bed of the truck and notice that traffic is lined up all the way around the garage, six whole flights, and no one is moving.  I am too tired to punch my friend. I call my friend a ""Stupid cocksucker."" 11:31 I lift my head to look out the bed of the truck and notice that traffic is lined up all the way around the garage, six whole flights, and no one is moving. I call my friend a ""Stupid cocksucker."" 11:38 I lift my head to look out the bed of the truck and notice that traffic is lined up all the way around the garage, six whole flights, and no one is moving. I call my friend a ""Stupid cocksucker."" 11:47 I lift my head to look out the bed of the truck and notice that traffic is lined up all the way around the garage, six whole flights, and  no one is moving. I call my friend a ""Stupid cocksucker."" 11:58 I am jostled. The truck is moving. I lift my head to look out the bed of the truck and notice that traffic is beginning to move on the second floor. I jump out of the truck, walk to the edge of the parking facility, and pee off the sixth floor onto the street below. My friend looks at me like I just anally violated his minor sister. I turn around and pee on the front of his truck while singing the lyrics to ""Neon Moon."" 12:11 We are moving. We are out of beer. I jump from the truck and go from vehicle to vehicle until someone gives me two beers. I am happy. I return to my vehicle. 12:26 We have emerged from the parking facility. We make our way to my apartment and find Ed sitting on the couch with a freshly opened bottle of Glenlivet on the coffee table in front of him. We are all going to die tonight. 12:59 We have finished three-quarters of the bottle of Glenlivet. We decide it would be a wonderful idea to go dancing at PollyEsther's. Ed has to pee. He walks down the hall to our apartment and directly into the full length  mirror at the end of the hall, smashing it into hundreds of pieces.  We giggle uncontrollably and leave for PollyEsther's. 1:17 The PollyEsther's doorman laughs uncontrollably at our efforts to enter his club. ""Fellas,"" he says in between his fits of spastic laughter, ""I've  been working this door for almost a year. I've been working doors in this town for almost 5 years. And I can honestly say that I ain't never seen three drunker mother fuckers than you three. Sorry, can't let you in."" We attempt to reason with him. He laughs harder. 1:44 We find a bar that lets us in. We take two steps in the door and hear ""Last call for alcohol!"" I turn to the group and mutter: ""See, dat wasn't that fuckin' hard. Day don't fuckin' do that at the Awamo...the awaom...the alab...fuck it, that stadium we was at today..."" We order 6 shots of tequila and three beers. 2:15 Back on the street. We need food. We hail a cab to take us the two and one half blocks to Katz's. The cab fare is $1.60. We give him $10 and tell him to keep it. 2:17 There is a 20 minute wait. We give the hostess $50. We are seated immediately. 2:25 We order two orders of fried pickles, a Cobb salad, a bowl of soup, two orders of Blueberry blintzes, two Reuben sandwiches, a hamburger, two cheese stuffed potatoes, an order of fries, and an order of onion rings. 2:39 The food arrives. We are all asleep with our heads onthe table. The waiter wakes us up. We eat every fucking bit of our food. Most of the restaurant patrons around us are disgusted. We don't give a fuck.

Awesome day. Not a single cloud in the sky. About 70 degrees. 11:55 I decide that we're going to kick the shit out of Nebraska. 11:56 I tell my first Nebraska fan to go fuck himself. 12:15 The UT band walks by on the way to the Alamodome. We're on the second floor of a two-story parking garage on the corner (a couple hundred of us). We're hooting and hollering like wildmen. The band doubles back to the street right below us and serenades us with Texas Fight and The Eyes of Texas. AWESOME MOMENT. 12:25 In the post-serenade serendipity, 50-100 grown men are bumping chests with one another, each and every one of them now secure and certain of the fact that we are going to kick the shit out of Nebraska. 1:00 The Nebraska band walks by on the way to the Alamodome. Again, we hoot and holler like wildmen. Again, the band doubles back and stops right below us to serenade us, this time, however, with the Nebraska fight songs. *Although somewhat impressed by their spirit and verve, we remain convinced that we are going to kick the shit out of Nebraska. 1:30 I begin the walk to the Alamodome, somehow managing to stuff the ""Traveler"" and 11 cans of beer into my pants. 1:47 I am in line surrounded by Nebraska fans. They are taunting me. I am taunting back, still certain that we are going to kick the shit out of Nebraska. I decide to challenge a particularly vocal Nebraska fan to play  what I now call and will forever be remembered as ""Cell-Phone Flop Out."" Remember flop out for a dollar? The rules are similar. I tell this Nebraska jackass that if he's so confident in his team, he should ""flop out"" his cell  phone RIGHT NOW and make plane reservations to Phoenix for the Fiesta Bowl.  And then I spoke these memorable words: ""And not those damn refundable tickets, either! You request those non-refundable, non-transferrable sons-of-bitches!"" He backs down. He is unworthy. I call Southwest Airlines and buy two tickets to Phoenix, non-refundable and non-transferrable. Price:  $712. He is humbled. He lowers his head in shame. I raise my cell phone in  triumph to the cheers of hundreds of Texas fans. I am KING and these are my  subjects. I distribute the 11 beers in my pants to the cheering masses. I  RULE the pre-game kingdom. 2:34 Kickoff. Brimming with confidence, I open the Traveler and pour my first stiffy. 2:45 I notice something troubling: Nebraska is big. Nebraska is fast. Nebraska is very pissed off at Texas. 3:01 The first quarter mercifully ends. 9 yards total offense for Texas. Zero first downs for Texas. I'm still talking shit. I pour another stiffy  from the Traveler. 3:36 Four minutes to go in the first half: the Traveler is a dead soldier.  I buy my first $5 beer from the Alamodome merchants. While I am standing in line, a center snap nearly decapitates Major Applewhite and rolls out of the end zone. Safety. 3:56 Halftime score: Nebraska 15, Texas 0. I wish I had another Traveler. 4:11 While urinating next to a Nebraska fan in the bathroom at halftime, I attempt to revive the classic Brice-ism from the South Bend bathroom: ""Hey, buddy, niiiiiiiiice cock."" He is unamused. 4:21 I buy my 2nd and 3rd $5 beer from the Alamodome merchants. I share my beer with two high school girls sitting behind me. Surprisingly, they are equipped with a flask full of vodka. I send them off to purchase Sprites, so that we may consume their vodka. I have not lost faith.  Nebraska is a bunch of pussies. 4:51 No more vodka. The girls sitting behind me have fled for their lives.  I purchase two more $5 beers from the Alamodome merchants. 5:18 Score is Nebraska 22, Texas 0. I am beginning to lose faith. This normally would trouble me, but I am too drunk to see the football field. 5:27 I call Southwest Airlines: ""I'm sorry, sir. Those tickets have been confirmed and are non-refundable and non-transferrable."" 5:37 I try to start a fight with every person behind the concession counter. As it turns out, the Alamodome has a policy that no beer can be sold when there is less than 10 minutes on the game clock. I am enraged by this policy. I ask loudly: ""Why the fuck didn't you announce last call over the fucking PA system??!!"" 5:49 Back in my seats, I am slumped in my chair in defeat. All of a sudden, the Texas crowd goes absolutely nuts. ""Whazzis?,"" I mutter, awaking from my coma, ""Iz we winnig? Did wez scort?"" Alas, the answer is no, we were not winning and we did not score. The largest (by far) cheer of the day from the Texas faithful occurred when the handlers were walking back to the tunnel and Bevo stopped to take a gargantuan shit all over the letters ""S"", ""K"", and ""A"" in the ""Nebraska"" spelled out in their end zone.  I cheer wildly.  I pick up the empty Traveler bottle and stick my tongue in it. I am thirsty. 6:16 Nebraska fans are going berserk as I walk back to the truck. I would taunt them with some off-color remarks about their parentage, but I am too drunk to form complete sentences. With my last cognitive thought of the evening, I take solace in the fact that if we had not beaten them in October, they would be playing Florida State for the national championship. 6:30 Back in the car. On the way back to Austin for the 8:00 Texas-Arizona tip off. We can still salvage the day! I crack open a beer.  *It is warm.  I don't care. 7:12 We have stopped for gas. I am hungry. I go inside the store. I walk past the beer frig. I notice a Zima. I've never had a Zima. I wonder if it's any good. I pull a Zima from the frig. I twist the top off and drink the Zima in three swallows. Zima sucks. I replace the empty bottle in the frig. 7:17 There is a Blimpie Subs in the store. I walk to where the ingredients are, where the person usually makes the sub. There is no one there. I lean over the counter and scoop out half a bucket of black olives. I eat them.  I am still hungry. I lean further over the counter and grab approximately two pounds of Pastrami. I walk out of the store grunting and eating Pastrami. The patrons in the store fear me. I don't care. 8:01 We are in South Austin. I have been drinking warm beer and singing Brooks and Dunn tunes for over an hour. My truck-mate is tired of my singing. He suggests that perhaps Brooks and Dunn have written other good songs besides ""You're Going to Miss Me When I'm Gone"" and ""Neon Moon"" and that maybe listening to only those two songs, ten times each was a bit excessive. Perhaps, he suggests, I could just let the CD play on its own.  I tell him to fuck off and restart ""Neon Moon."" 8:30 We arrive at the Erwin Center. My truckmate, against my loud and profane protestations, parks on the top floor of a nearby parking garage.  I tell him he's an idiot. I tell him we will never get out. I tell him we may as well pitch a fucking tent here. He ignores me. I think he's still pissed about the Brooks and Dunn tunes. I whistle ""Neon Moon"" loudly. 8:47 I am rallying. I have 4 warm beers stuffed in my pants. We're going to kick the shit out of Arizona. 9:11 Halftime score: Texas 31, Arizona 29. I am pleased. I go to the bathroom to pee for the 67th time today. I giggle to myself because of the new opportunity to do ""the bathroom Brice."" There are no Arizona fans in the bathroom. I am disappointed. I tell myself (out loud) that I have a ""Niiiiiice cock."" No one is amused but me. 9:41 I walk to the bathroom while drinking Bud Light out of a can.  Needless to say, they do not sell beer at the Erwin Center,much less Bud Light out  of a can. I am stopped by an usher: ""Where did you get that, sir?"" I tell him (no shit): ""Oh, the cheerleaders were throwing them up with those little plastic footballs. Would you mind throwing this away for me?"" I take the last swig and hand it to him. He is confused. I pretend I'm going to the bathroom, but I run away giggling instead. I duck into some entrance to avoid the usher, who is now pursuing me. I sneak into a large group of people and sit down. The usher walks by harmlessly. I am giggling like a little girl. I crack open another can of Bud Light. 9:52 I am lost. In my haste to avoid the usher, I have lostmy bearings. I have no ticket stub. I cannot find my seats. Texas is losing. 10:09 Texas is being screwed by the refs. I am enraged. I have cleared out the seats around me because I keep removing my hat and beating the surrounding chairs with it. A concerned fan asks if I'm OK and perhaps I shouldn't take it so seriously. I tell him to fuck off. 10:15 After the fourth consecutive ""worst fucking call I have EVER seen,"" I attempt to remove my hat again to begin beating inanimate objects.  However, on this occasion I miscalculate and I thumbnail myself in my left eyelid, leaving a one-quarter inch gash over my eye. I am now bleeding into my left eye and all over my shirt. ""Perhaps,"" I think to myself, ""I'm taking this a bit seriously."" 10:22 I am standing in the bathroom peeing. I'm so drunk I am swaying and grunting. I have a bloody napkin pressed on my left eye. My pants are bloody. I have my (formerly) white shirt wrapped around my waist. I look like I should be in an episode of Cops. 10:43 Texas has lost. I put my bloody white shirt back on my body and make my way for the exits. I am stopped every 20 seconds by a good samaritan/cop/security guard to ask me why I am covered in blood, but I merely grunt incoherently and keep moving. 10:59 With my one good eye, I have located the parking garage. I walk up six flights of stairs, promise that when I see my friend I will punch him in the face for making me walk up six flights of stairs, find the truck, and collapse in a heap in the bed of the truck. I look around and notice that traffic is lined up all the way around the garage, six whole flights, and  no one is moving. I take a nap. 11:17 I awake from my nap. I see my friend in the driver's seat. I lift my head to look out the bed of the truck and notice that traffic is lined up all the way around the garage, six whole flights, and no one is moving.  I am too tired to punch my friend. I call my friend a ""Stupid cocksucker."" 11:31 I lift my head to look out the bed of the truck and notice that traffic is lined up all the way around the garage, six whole flights, and no one is moving. I call my friend a ""Stupid cocksucker."" 11:38 I lift my head to look out the bed of the truck and notice that traffic is lined up all the way around the garage, six whole flights, and no one is moving. I call my friend a ""Stupid cocksucker."" 11:47 I lift my head to look out the bed of the truck and notice that traffic is lined up all the way around the garage, six whole flights, and  no one is moving. I call my friend a ""Stupid cocksucker."" 11:58 I am jostled. The truck is moving. I lift my head to look out the bed of the truck and notice that traffic is beginning to move on the second floor. I jump out of the truck, walk to the edge of the parking facility, and pee off the sixth floor onto the street below. My friend looks at me like I just anally violated his minor sister. I turn around and pee on the front of his truck while singing the lyrics to ""Neon Moon."" 12:11 We are moving. We are out of beer. I jump from the truck and go from vehicle to vehicle until someone gives me two beers. I am happy. I return to my vehicle. 12:26 We have emerged from the parking facility. We make our way to my apartment and find Ed sitting on the couch with a freshly opened bottle of Glenlivet on the coffee table in front of him. We are all going to die tonight. 12:59 We have finished three-quarters of the bottle of Glenlivet. We decide it would be a wonderful idea to go dancing at PollyEsther's. Ed has to pee. He walks down the hall to our apartment and directly into the full length  mirror at the end of the hall, smashing it into hundreds of pieces.  We giggle uncontrollably and leave for PollyEsther's. 1:17 The PollyEsther's doorman laughs uncontrollably at our efforts to enter his club. ""Fellas,"" he says in between his fits of spastic laughter, ""I've  been working this door for almost a year. I've been working doors in this town for almost 5 years. And I can honestly say that I ain't never seen three drunker mother fuckers than you three. Sorry, can't let you in."" We attempt to reason with him. He laughs harder. 1:44 We find a bar that lets us in. We take two steps in the door and hear ""Last call for alcohol!"" I turn to the group and mutter: ""See, dat wasn't that fuckin' hard. Day don't fuckin' do that at the Awamo...the awaom...the alab...fuck it, that stadium we was at today..."" We order 6 shots of tequila and three beers. 2:15 Back on the street. We need food. We hail a cab to take us the two and one half blocks to Katz's. The cab fare is $1.60. We give him $10 and tell him to keep it. 2:17 There is a 20 minute wait. We give the hostess $50. We are seated immediately. 2:25 We order two orders of fried pickles, a Cobb salad, a bowl of soup, two orders of Blueberry blintzes, two Reuben sandwiches, a hamburger, two cheese stuffed potatoes, an order of fries, and an order of onion rings. 2:39 The food arrives. We are all asleep with our heads onthe table. The waiter wakes us up. We eat every fucking bit of our food. Most of the restaurant patrons around us are disgusted. We don't give a fuck. The tab is $112 with tip. 2:46 I'm sleepy. 9:12 I wake up next to a strange woman. She is the bartender at Katz's. She is not pretty. > > >   - att1.htm     ","gary.stadler@enron.com, chris.abel@enron.com, tobin.carlson@enron.com,   daniel.falcone@enron.com",susan.scott@enron.com,Fw: This is long but definitely worth reading,2000-04-13 04:02:00-07:00,sent

I call my friend a ""Stupid cocksucker."" 11:38 I lift my head to look out the bed of the truck and notice that traffic is lined up all the way around the garage, six whole flights, and no one is moving. I call my friend a ""Stupid cocksucker."" 11:47 I lift my head to look out the bed of the truck and notice that traffic is lined up all the way around the garage, six whole flights, and  no one is moving. I call my friend a ""Stupid cocksucker."" 11:58 I am jostled. The truck is moving. I lift my head to look out the bed of the truck and notice that traffic is beginning to move on the second floor. I jump out of the truck, walk to the edge of the parking facility, and pee off the sixth floor onto the street below. My friend looks at me like I just anally violated his minor sister. I turn around and pee on the front of his truck while singing the lyrics to ""Neon Moon."" 12:11 We are moving. We are out of beer. I jump from the truck and go from vehicle to vehicle until someone gives me two beers. I am happy. I return to my vehicle. 12:26 We have emerged from the parking facility. We make our way to my apartment and find Ed sitting on the couch with a freshly opened bottle of Glenlivet on the coffee table in front of him. We are all going to die tonight. 12:59 We have finished three-quarters of the bottle of Glenlivet. We decide it would be a wonderful idea to go dancing at PollyEsther's. Ed has to pee. He walks down the hall to our apartment and directly into the full length  mirror at the end of the hall, smashing it into hundreds of pieces.  We giggle uncontrollably and leave for PollyEsther's. 1:17 The PollyEsther's doorman laughs uncontrollably at our efforts to enter his club. ""Fellas,"" he says in between his fits of spastic laughter, ""I've  been working this door for almost a year. I've been working doors in this town for almost 5 years. And I can honestly say that I ain't never seen three drunker mother fuckers than you three. Sorry, can't let you in."" We attempt to reason with him. He laughs harder. 1:44 We find a bar that lets us in. We take two steps in the door and hear ""Last call for alcohol!"" I turn to the group and mutter: ""See, dat wasn't that fuckin' hard. Day don't fuckin' do that at the Awamo...the awaom...the alab...fuck it, that stadium we was at today..."" We order 6 shots of tequila and three beers. 2:15 Back on the street. We need food. We hail a cab to take us the two and one half blocks to Katz's. The cab fare is $1.60. We give him $10 and tell him to keep it. 2:17 There is a 20 minute wait. We give the hostess $50. We are seated immediately. 2:25 We order two orders of fried pickles, a Cobb salad, a bowl of soup, two orders of Blueberry blintzes, two Reuben sandwiches, a hamburger, two cheese stuffed potatoes, an order of fries, and an order of onion rings. 2:39 The food arrives. We are all asleep with our heads onthe table. The waiter wakes us up. We eat every fucking bit of our food. Most of the restaurant patrons around us are disgusted. We don't give a fuck. The tab is $112 with tip. 2:46 I'm sleepy. 9:12 I wake up next to a strange woman. She is the bartender at Katz's.

Awesome day. Not a single cloud in the sky. About 70 degrees. 11:55 I decide that we're going to kick the shit out of Nebraska. 11:56 I tell my first Nebraska fan to go fuck himself. 12:15 The UT band walks by on the way to the Alamodome. We're on the second floor of a two-story parking garage on the corner (a couple hundred of us). We're hooting and hollering like wildmen. The band doubles back to the street right below us and serenades us with Texas Fight and The Eyes of Texas. AWESOME MOMENT. 12:25 In the post-serenade serendipity, 50-100 grown men are bumping chests with one another, each and every one of them now secure and certain of the fact that we are going to kick the shit out of Nebraska. 1:00 The Nebraska band walks by on the way to the Alamodome. Again, we hoot and holler like wildmen. Again, the band doubles back and stops right below us to serenade us, this time, however, with the Nebraska fight songs. *Although somewhat impressed by their spirit and verve, we remain convinced that we are going to kick the shit out of Nebraska. 1:30 I begin the walk to the Alamodome, somehow managing to stuff the ""Traveler"" and 11 cans of beer into my pants. 1:47 I am in line surrounded by Nebraska fans. They are taunting me. I am taunting back, still certain that we are going to kick the shit out of Nebraska. I decide to challenge a particularly vocal Nebraska fan to play  what I now call and will forever be remembered as ""Cell-Phone Flop Out."" Remember flop out for a dollar? The rules are similar. I tell this Nebraska jackass that if he's so confident in his team, he should ""flop out"" his cell  phone RIGHT NOW and make plane reservations to Phoenix for the Fiesta Bowl.  And then I spoke these memorable words: ""And not those damn refundable tickets, either! You request those non-refundable, non-transferrable sons-of-bitches!"" He backs down. He is unworthy. I call Southwest Airlines and buy two tickets to Phoenix, non-refundable and non-transferrable. Price:  $712. He is humbled. He lowers his head in shame. I raise my cell phone in  triumph to the cheers of hundreds of Texas fans. I am KING and these are my  subjects. I distribute the 11 beers in my pants to the cheering masses. I  RULE the pre-game kingdom. 2:34 Kickoff. Brimming with confidence, I open the Traveler and pour my first stiffy. 2:45 I notice something troubling: Nebraska is big. Nebraska is fast. Nebraska is very pissed off at Texas. 3:01 The first quarter mercifully ends. 9 yards total offense for Texas. Zero first downs for Texas. I'm still talking shit. I pour another stiffy  from the Traveler. 3:36 Four minutes to go in the first half: the Traveler is a dead soldier.  I buy my first $5 beer from the Alamodome merchants. While I am standing in line, a center snap nearly decapitates Major Applewhite and rolls out of the end zone. Safety. 3:56 Halftime score: Nebraska 15, Texas 0. I wish I had another Traveler. 4:11 While urinating next to a Nebraska fan in the bathroom at halftime, I attempt to revive the classic Brice-ism from the South Bend bathroom: ""Hey, buddy, niiiiiiiiice cock."" He is unamused. 4:21 I buy my 2nd and 3rd $5 beer from the Alamodome merchants. I share my beer with two high school girls sitting behind me. Surprisingly, they are equipped with a flask full of vodka. I send them off to purchase Sprites, so that we may consume their vodka. I have not lost faith.  Nebraska is a bunch of pussies. 4:51 No more vodka. The girls sitting behind me have fled for their lives.  I purchase two more $5 beers from the Alamodome merchants. 5:18 Score is Nebraska 22, Texas 0. I am beginning to lose faith. This normally would trouble me, but I am too drunk to see the football field. 5:27 I call Southwest Airlines: ""I'm sorry, sir. Those tickets have been confirmed and are non-refundable and non-transferrable."" 5:37 I try to start a fight with every person behind the concession counter. As it turns out, the Alamodome has a policy that no beer can be sold when there is less than 10 minutes on the game clock. I am enraged by this policy. I ask loudly: ""Why the fuck didn't you announce last call over the fucking PA system??!!"" 5:49 Back in my seats, I am slumped in my chair in defeat. All of a sudden, the Texas crowd goes absolutely nuts. ""Whazzis?,"" I mutter, awaking from my coma, ""Iz we winnig? Did wez scort?"" Alas, the answer is no, we were not winning and we did not score. The largest (by far) cheer of the day from the Texas faithful occurred when the handlers were walking back to the tunnel and Bevo stopped to take a gargantuan shit all over the letters ""S"", ""K"", and ""A"" in the ""Nebraska"" spelled out in their end zone.  I cheer wildly.  I pick up the empty Traveler bottle and stick my tongue in it. I am thirsty. 6:16 Nebraska fans are going berserk as I walk back to the truck. I would taunt them with some off-color remarks about their parentage, but I am too drunk to form complete sentences. With my last cognitive thought of the evening, I take solace in the fact that if we had not beaten them in October, they would be playing Florida State for the national championship. 6:30 Back in the car. On the way back to Austin for the 8:00 Texas-Arizona tip off. We can still salvage the day! I crack open a beer.  *It is warm.  I don't care. 7:12 We have stopped for gas. I am hungry. I go inside the store. I walk past the beer frig. I notice a Zima. I've never had a Zima. I wonder if it's any good. I pull a Zima from the frig. I twist the top off and drink the Zima in three swallows. Zima sucks. I replace the empty bottle in the frig. 7:17 There is a Blimpie Subs in the store. I walk to where the ingredients are, where the person usually makes the sub. There is no one there. I lean over the counter and scoop out half a bucket of black olives. I eat them.  I am still hungry. I lean further over the counter and grab approximately two pounds of Pastrami. I walk out of the store grunting and eating Pastrami. The patrons in the store fear me. I don't care. 8:01 We are in South Austin. I have been drinking warm beer and singing Brooks and Dunn tunes for over an hour. My truck-mate is tired of my singing. He suggests that perhaps Brooks and Dunn have written other good songs besides ""You're Going to Miss Me When I'm Gone"" and ""Neon Moon"" and that maybe listening to only those two songs, ten times each was a bit excessive. Perhaps, he suggests, I could just let the CD play on its own.  I tell him to fuck off and restart ""Neon Moon."" 8:30 We arrive at the Erwin Center. My truckmate, against my loud and profane protestations, parks on the top floor of a nearby parking garage.  I tell him he's an idiot. I tell him we will never get out. I tell him we may as well pitch a fucking tent here. He ignores me. I think he's still pissed about the Brooks and Dunn tunes. I whistle ""Neon Moon"" loudly. 8:47 I am rallying. I have 4 warm beers stuffed in my pants. We're going to kick the shit out of Arizona. 9:11 Halftime score: Texas 31, Arizona 29. I am pleased. I go to the bathroom to pee for the 67th time today. I giggle to myself because of the new opportunity to do ""the bathroom Brice."" There are no Arizona fans in the bathroom. I am disappointed. I tell myself (out loud) that I have a ""Niiiiiice cock."" No one is amused but me. 9:41 I walk to the bathroom while drinking Bud Light out of a can.  Needless to say, they do not sell beer at the Erwin Center,much less Bud Light out  of a can. I am stopped by an usher: ""Where did you get that, sir?"" I tell him (no shit): ""Oh, the cheerleaders were throwing them up with those little plastic footballs. Would you mind throwing this away for me?"" I take the last swig and hand it to him. He is confused. I pretend I'm going to the bathroom, but I run away giggling instead. I duck into some entrance to avoid the usher, who is now pursuing me. I sneak into a large group of people and sit down. The usher walks by harmlessly. I am giggling like a little girl. I crack open another can of Bud Light. 9:52 I am lost. In my haste to avoid the usher, I have lostmy bearings. I have no ticket stub. I cannot find my seats. Texas is losing. 10:09 Texas is being screwed by the refs. I am enraged. I have cleared out the seats around me because I keep removing my hat and beating the surrounding chairs with it. A concerned fan asks if I'm OK and perhaps I shouldn't take it so seriously. I tell him to fuck off. 10:15 After the fourth consecutive ""worst fucking call I have EVER seen,"" I attempt to remove my hat again to begin beating inanimate objects.  However, on this occasion I miscalculate and I thumbnail myself in my left eyelid, leaving a one-quarter inch gash over my eye. I am now bleeding into my left eye and all over my shirt. ""Perhaps,"" I think to myself, ""I'm taking this a bit seriously."" 10:22 I am standing in the bathroom peeing. I'm so drunk I am swaying and grunting. I have a bloody napkin pressed on my left eye. My pants are bloody. I have my (formerly) white shirt wrapped around my waist. I look like I should be in an episode of Cops. 10:43 Texas has lost. I put my bloody white shirt back on my body and make my way for the exits. I am stopped every 20 seconds by a good samaritan/cop/security guard to ask me why I am covered in blood, but I merely grunt incoherently and keep moving. 10:59 With my one good eye, I have located the parking garage. I walk up six flights of stairs, promise that when I see my friend I will punch him in the face for making me walk up six flights of stairs, find the truck, and collapse in a heap in the bed of the truck. I look around and notice that traffic is lined up all the way around the garage, six whole flights, and  no one is moving. I take a nap. 11:17 I awake from my nap. I see my friend in the driver's seat. I lift my head to look out the bed of the truck and notice that traffic is lined up all the way around the garage, six whole flights, and no one is moving.  I am too tired to punch my friend. I call my friend a ""Stupid cocksucker."" 11:31 I lift my head to look out the bed of the truck and notice that traffic is lined up all the way around the garage, six whole flights, and no one is moving.

"Vanessa, I checked with Bill, and the very unsatisfying answer to your  question is that it totally depends on how Greg divided the community  property with his ex.  He agreed with me that a will is a good idea in any  case because you can arrange things so that you avoid legal proceedings and  save a lot in taxes!  Our friend Tony Maluski does probate work:  I believe  his number is 713-228-7401.  He's a nice guy and I believe him to be  competent; however, I think it is a good idea to shop around when you're  doing something routine like a will or an uncontested divorce, so I'd advise  calling several lawyers and see who you like best and who will give you the  best deal.

"As you know, we recently did an east-to-east deal with USGT for 400,000  MMBtu/day with alternate rights to California  at a higher rate.  SoCal filed a protest and I'm working on the response.  In  part, they are alleging that TW is ""attempting to exploit a weakness"" in the  GISB procedures to the detriment of existing customers.  For example, under  TW's tariff (which they concede is GISB compliant), primary firm cannot bump  alt. firm in cycle 2.  SoCal says this means that any primary shipper  attempting to deliever to an in-path alt. point will be unable to re-nominate  to its primary point once this ""alternate"" capacity [I assume they mean  USGT's] is confirmed.  According to SoCal this will substantially limit  shippers' flexibility, including the ability to use market area pooling.   Once gas is nominated thru a pool its subsequent movement to a delivery point  is defined as an al. delivery regardless of the rights of the capacity under  which it moves.  Thus by manipulating the GISB cycle process, TW and USGT  will bump firm shippers.  I could really use your help in responding to this argument.  (First of all,  I'm not sure I even understand it!)  If either of you have a few minutes  today or tomorrow when we could get together, that would be great.  Also --  you two were the first to come to mind, but feel free to refer me to someone  else in your group if you are swamped.  Please e-mail or call when you get a  chance... Thanks!

This change effects both TAGG - Deal Capture and TAGG - Deal  Clearing.  In order to be ready for the commercial people in case they use the two  legged Gas Daily deal, I am requesting that your Gas Daily team input maybe 20-25 deals in  TAGG - Deal Capture using the new guidelines.  Ron Nolte has outlined below how the input  process  should be handled for these types of deals.  I will be out of the office Monday and Tuesday of next week so I am  requesting that the Gas  Daily team have these deals in by next Wednesday.

In order for this as well as the changes to the Settlement process  to work,  the following rules must be adhered to when the deal is captured.  1) The fixed price must be entered as leg 1. 2) The float price must be entered as leg 2.  3) Leg 1 and leg 2 must be ""linked"" by clicking the ""Link"" button on the deal  capture  window and by inserting a row as follows:      The ""Purpose"" above will be listed as ""Deal Link"" when the picklist  displays.  The ""Link"" can be  done from either leg 1 or leg 2.   4) The  confirm can only be created/revised/viewed/printed/faxed  from leg 1.   5) The clearing status of the deal can only be changed from leg 1.   Please note that  any change to the status of either leg will be reflected  on the other  leg automatically; e.g., assume a confirm is created on leg 1,  the deal  status of both   legs will display ""Generated"".  Then assume someone changes leg 2 in Deal  Capture,  the status of both legs in TAGG deal clearing will be automatically set to  ""Pending -  Revised after Generated"".

(You've privately believed that                    the rules don't necessarily apply to you.) This                    month, your incredible adaptability and powers of                    persuasion help you shed the status quo and                    break out of the corral. Unless you catch your                    foot in a bear trap, nothing can stop you. People                    are fascinated by your mind, wit, ideas, and                    conversation. (Don't forget: Oprah Winfrey is an                    Aquarius!) Your views are welcomed and                    provoke others to investigate things they may                    have taken for granted. Speak up during the first                    week, especially if it's to announce you're                    starting a new venture. Business travel is likely                    during the first and third weeks, especially if                    contractual issues need to be finalized. Travel is                    actually enjoyable this month and can open your                    eyes to fresh horizons.

"Frank and Steve, see the attached.  My theory, which is based on our  experience with the Gallup compressor, is that we could enter into a joint  ownership and operating agreement with Agave, and as long as we convince the  Commission that the agreements give TW sufficient control over the operation  of the facility to ensure FERC regs are complied with, they will be OK with  the joint ownership -- and not try to assert jurisdiction over Agave (a  gathering company).  Although it seems likely that other pipelines have  entered into such arrangements, I've not found any cases on point here.  Do you agree with my conclusion?  Any other ideas or insights?

We are working with Agave to develop a storage facility near the  West Tx lateral in Eddy County, NM.

TW would then lease out storage space to shippers plus use storage  capacity to augment our Park N Ride capability.  The storage would be  connected via lateral to our W Tx line.

Whatever happens and whatever is said about your move don't ever lose sight  of the fact that in every aspect of this situation you conducted yourself in  the best and most open manner possible.  In no way can or should your conduct  be called into question.  Bearing that in mind any criticism that was  expressed within the meeting this morning was beyond inappropriate.

Furthermore, just keep focused on what an incredible  opportunity this move is going to be for you and all of the doors it will  inevitably open.

Our consulting agreement with IGS (which  has now terminated) provided for a flat fee, plus an incentive fee calculated  using the net present value of any contract ""identified by IGS"" and entered  into during the term of the consulting agreement.  During the term of the  agreement, TW entered into its Gallup Expansion agreement with Southern.  IGS  is now claiming it brought in the deal and so is entitled to an incentive  fee.  While it is undisputed that Mark discussed the deal with Southern,  Southern was also on Lorraine's list of shippers to contact for Gallup  Expansion capacity.  Also, the capacity was posted for all to see.  So, while  Mark can certainly claim he ""identified"" the deal, he was not alone in doing  so.   Steve is going to call Mark in response to his letter (after he talks to  Lorraine to verify facts).  Our thinking is that if we offer IGS some money  they will be happy.  We would really like to preserve what has been a good  working relationship with this consultant.   On the other hand, I think we  could probably take the position that they are not entitled to any incentive  fee.  However, since the contract is silent as to whether IGS has to be the  only party bringing in the deal in order to qualify for the incentive fee,  this position is not as strong as I'd like it to be, and IGS might sue TW.   The amount in dispute could be as much as $200,000, depending on what rate we  use in calculating net present value.  If you have any problem with our offering to pay part of the incentive fee to  IGS, let me know.  I think it will be very important for Steve not to admit  that Mark helped in any way in getting the deal -- just in case they do  decide to take us to court.

The  engineer did report that the vibration is high for a new compressor, but not  harmful to the compressor for the short term.  It is Rolls engineer's opinion that the excessive bearing vibration is due to  vibrations created by gas flow through the suction strainer.  Rolls will be  reviewing the gathered vibration data over the next few days to provide any  further feedback.  TW Ops, via independent tests, has determined that the amplitude of the  vibration that is eminating from the suction strainer is at a level which  can, over time, be detrimental to the mechanical integrity of the unit  piping.   EECC, TW Ops Mgmt, and the TW Ops Team have discussed the situation and have  decided to temporarily take the unit out of service to pull the suction  strainer.  The strainer will be inspected for foreign material or damage.   The strainer will not be replaced unless some foreign material is found.  It  is hoped that the removal of the strainer will 'de-tune' the piping system.  EECC, TW Ops Mgmt, and the TW Ops Team all feel that the risk of running  without the startup strainer is minimized since the unit has been running  intermittently for the past few days and has accumulated some significant run  time.  It is expected that  any foreign material in the suction piping should  have already been caught in the strainer.  Secondly, the station was designed  with a suction scrubber which will further protect the compressor.  It is expected that the unit will be unavailable until midnight May 4, while  the startup strainer is removed.  Care must be taken during the  reinstallation of the piping spool as to not affect the compressor alignment  or apply stress to the compressor nozzles.

"Hi Mum!  The trip was pretty exhausting.  Friday we saw Hoover Dam, had lunch  at a great diner in Kingman (on Route 66!) and rolled into Sedona around 5.   Climbed around the red rocks of Sedona all day on Saturday, sat by the pool  in the afternoon and I did some shopping.   Sunday we drove to Grand Canyon  and did part of the Bright Angel trail.  That was pretty strenuous but  definitely worth it.  Wish we could have made it a longer trip but we had  Bill's trial schedule to deal with.  I'll spare you the details of my trip  home -- suffice it to say I didn't make it back to Houston until about noon  yesterday and have a $200 travel voucher for my trouble.  I will definitely come to Austin next weekend but probably will not get in  until later on Saturday.  How about a homemade (by Chef Sooz) brunch on  Sunday a.m.?  Have to run to a meeting ... for race info, I would try a search for Texaco  or Texaco Gran(d?) Prix on the Internet.  I know that Texaco probably has it  on their website.  If you don't find anything let me know. Love, Sooz     Camp2scott@aol.com on 05/09/2000 01:37:42 PM To: Susan.Scott@enron.com cc:    Subject: your trip   Hi, Sooz!  Hope you had a wonderful time in Ariz, saw all kinds of wonderful things, and didn't fall into the Canyon and expire.  Hope you took a lot of photos. Can't wait to hear all about it.  I had a good time with Grayson.  Jim and I fed her bottles Sat and Sun, and she took them without a whimper.  Karin is feeling liberated!  I think she wants to quit breastfeeding since she is having to pump at the office, and everytime Grayson misses a feeding from her.  Jim is upset.  She has an ally in Eric.  He says, men don't know when to stay out of something like that. Anyway, Grayson is turning out to be a very happy baby.  Everytime you look at her, she breaks out in a huge smile.  Are you coming next weekend?  K&J are and have made a couple of hc appts. One is for 6:45 Fri which they fear they won't be able to make.  Trying to get some enthusiasm to pull out all the dead ground cover and plant something else, but so far, can't seem to get the momentum.  Everything else is looking pretty good with all our rains.  Except that the shrub people raped the photinias by the street.  They say they should come back nicely. We'll see.  Is there someplace you can find info about the car races in Sept?  Eric has a free ticket he needs to use by Nov 15.  I don't know how this would work with our CA trip planned for Oct. 3-17.  Had no problem getting a place to stay in Carmel and we're working out from there.  We'll probably stay in Santa Cruz about 4 nights so we can do some sailing.

On  the 25th, we would go from 12Noon-2:30PM on capacity and 2:30-4:00PM on  retail matters.

We should concentrate on nailing down  the substance of our arguments prior to the 24th and then work to reach  alignment between the various witnesses over the two day practice sessions.?

Rod Hayslett  05/10/2000 06:38 AM To: Bob Chandler/ET&S/Enron@ENRON cc:    Subject: Re: TW Proposal for Fuel Retention in Dollars (not in-kind) -- Draft  Accounting Memo    Some simple questions?      As I indicated this morning, it's not that I ""want"" to classify these credits  as revenues in order to achieve any commercial, regulatory, overhead  allocation or tax objectives, but if all other factors are considered equal  believe that revenue treatment is the most appropriate decision from  both  GAAP and FERC USofA standpoints.    FERC USofA  In the ""Shipper Supplied Gas"" section of Order 581 the Commission concluded  that ""it is not appropriate to mandate revenue recognition for gas provided  by shippers for compressor fuel and other pipeline system use and used to  provide transportation services.  Instead, each pipeline will have the  discretion to determine whether it will recognize revenue for these  transactions in its accounting records...Pipelines electing to recognize  shipper provided gas as revenue must also recognize an equal amount of  purchased gas expense.  Pipelines would credit the appropriate transportation  revenue account (Accounts 489.1 through 489.4) and record an equal amount in  Account 805, Other Gas Purchases.""    We have chosen not to recognize  revenue, but we do want to track our transactions, so we debit and credit  different subaccounts of acct 805.  The over-retained volumes on TW are  debited to acct 805 and credited to acct 495 Other Revenues (also in  accordance with Order 581. However, for internal reporting we map the 495  credit to cost of transport (expense).    Sounds reasonable to me.    Will  you be able to continue that in SAP? Yes.  We'll be using statistical orders  in lieu of subaccounts. While the Commission agreed that pipelines would not be required to recognize  shipper provided gas on its books, it did require those who chose to do so to  record it as transportation revenue, not as a credit to fuel or gas purchase  expense.  GAAP  Revenues.  Statement of Financial Accounting Concepts No. 6 defines revenues  as inflows or other enhancements of assets of an entity or settlements of its  liabilities (or a combination of both) from delivering or purchasing goods,  rendering services, or other activities that constitute the entity's ongoing  major or central operations.  In the TW proposal the cash inflows are the result of a fuel charge factor in  the transportation tariff.  TW's ongoing major or central operation is the  rendering of natural gas transportation services to shippers pursuant to its  tariff.  Therefore  the credits resulting from the assessment of the fuel  charge constitute transportation revenues.    I don't think there is a  limitation with respect to cash received in lieu of gas.  When gas is  retained we can debit and credit 805 and it's a wash.  When we receive cash  we have to charge a balance sheet account (Cash) and credit an income  statement account.  We can't opt out of recording an earnings creating  transaction.   What is the argument that this cash does not just take the  place of Gas you would have received and should track the normal accounting  for gas?  The cash alone cannot take the place of a retained volume; the cash  together with a gas purchase is the volumetric equivalent of a volume  retained.   Under this proposal we would charge gas purchase expense when the  cash is used to buy gas that would replace the volumes not retained in  kind.   I am concerned that what you are proposing may not work as well after  the next rate case (since I don't believe it likely we will be allowed to  continue to collect the windfall) and we may be setting ourselves up for  restatements.    But I guess it really won't matter, because whatever we do  FERC will have specifically ordered us to account for it that way, isn't that  right?  There is nothing about our current or proposed accounting that would  have to be changed as the result of a future rate case that changes the  volumetric retention factors.  However, if a tracker is imposed, then we  would have additional entries to make, similar to those we now make on NNG.   In any event, the  imbalance cashout  approach described below  would result  in the recording of fuel retention entries  (debit and credit account 805)   exactly the same as we now record for volumes  retained.  It would merely  result in the additional entry to resolve the imbalance by debiting cash and  crediting the imbalance receivable from the shipper.    Expenses.  Statement of Financial Accounting Concepts No. 5 speaks to the  recognition of expenses and losses:  ""Further guidance for recognition of  expenses and losses is intended to recognize consumption (using up) of  economic benefits...during a period.  Expenses...are generally recognized  when an entity's economic benefits are used up in delivering or producing  goods, rendering service, or other activities that constitute its ongoing  major or central operations...""  In the TW proposal natural gas volumes are consumed in the operation of  compressor engines to render natural gas transportation service to  shippers...the ongoing major or central operation of the company.  Receiving  cash from shippers in accordance with the Tariff's fuel charge does not  reduce the consumption of natural gas volumes in rendering transportation  service, Instead it provides economic assets (cash) to the company to pay for  the gas volumes that have to be acquired to run the compressors.  Therefore  the proceeds from the fuel charge represent transportation revenues for the  company, not a fuel or gas purchase expense reduction.     I recently  received a memo from Susan Scott (Legal) indicating that in approving tariff  changes to allow shippers to pay cash for fuel use rather than to provide  in-kind volumes, FERC looks at the situation as being analogous to cashing  out an imbalance, where the imbalance was created by the shipper not  delivering the fuel retention volumes.  If we followed FERC's lead here we  would record the fuel retention entries with a debit and credit to Account  805, then credit the cash receipt from the shipper as a reduction of its  imbalance.  Any gain or loss on the cash-out would be credited to Acct 495  (gain) or charged to Acct 813 (loss), just like any other gain or loss on  resolution of an imbalance.    I think the cashout approach will probably meet the objective of not bloating  reported margins...at least if the tariff language is consistent with this  concept.  If you prefer this cashout approach to my original proposal to  record fee revenue, then I will go ahead and re-draft the accounting memo  along those lines.  Any final determination of the appropriate accounting,  though, would have to be made after the language in the tariff revision is  finalized. However, if the cashout approach is your preference, then I expect  that we could work with Rates to make sure that the tariff language doesn't  conflict with the cashout approach.  Shall I re-draft and recirculate the memo using the cashout approach?

From an historical perspective before Order 636 we  didn't seem to have any difficulty recording the proceeds from the PGA  tracker portion of the tariff as transportation revenue.  Under the proposed  circumstances, we are charging a fee based on average fuel retention  percentages that are set somewhat higher than actual consumption and there is  no requirement for a true-up.  In this circumstance, even though we may call  it a fuel reimbursement factor, it seems to be more characteristic of revenue  than expense credit.    That having been said, if it's deemed to be advantageous to the company to  account for these cash proceeds as an expense credit, I could support  crediting the proceeds to a/c 805 similar to our accounting for volumetric  fuel retention.  If that's the path you'd like us to follow, I'll amend the  draft memo accordingly.  Please confirm.

The Commission stated that while TW's proposal may be in the  public interest, further investigation of the issues, including those raised  by Dynegy in its protest, is necessary prior to authorization.  The order  does not make clear what issues are to be investigated, but they seem to  include:  whether TW will, in effect, become a marketer for PNM's services,  whether the rates are just and reasonable and whether there is any expansion  of monopoly power.  Additionally, the Commission noted that while PNM has  certificate (i.e., public convenience & necessity) authority to transport gas  in interstate commerce, PNM will ""have to either explain how it has  appropriate rate authority for transportation of natural gas in interstate  commerce, or seek appropriate rate authority from the Commission.""

Glen               From:  Susan Scott                           05/16/2000 11:44 AM    To: Mary Kay Miller/ET&S/Enron@ENRON, Mary Darveaux/ET&S/Enron@ENRON, Glen  Hass/ET&S/Enron@ENRON cc: Drew Fossum@ENRON   Subject: TW LFT  I have been working with Ramona and Lorraine to make system adjustments to  TW's LFT arising from conclusions made at a Northern LFT meeting a few weeks  ago.  One change that has been called for is that if a Limited Day is called  (for now let's say a total Limited Day, without notifying shippers of any  percentages), no LFT can flow at any time during that day but the LFT shipper  would have the option to flow IT to the extent space is available.  If a  Limited Day were called notifying shippers that only a certain percentage  would flow, LFT shippers would be able to flow that percentage, and the rest  could be scheduled IT.    Drew latched onto this when I mentioned it to him and wanted to debate this  change with me.  As currently configured, TW's system would allow LFT  shippers to put in nominations on a Limited Day, and if any LFT capacity were  in fact available that LFT would be scheduled.  Similarly, if TW were to  notify shippers of a partial Limited Day (say 50%), and 60% of the capacity  in fact became available, TW's system (today) would allow LFT shippers to put  their nominations in and flow 60%, not limit them to 50%.   TW's tariff  language appears suitably vague to allow this --  a Limited Day is defined as  a day on which TW may choose not to schedule service in whole or in part, and  the billing section has a provision for Limited Days on which any quantity of  gas is transported.    Our question was whether, by changing TW's LFT system as described in the  first paragraph, we wouldn't be leaving some firm transportation revenue on  the table (because the IT rate is generally lower than our firm rate).  If  so, is the change necessary for some other reason?   Please let me know what  you think.  SS          ",lorraine.lindberg@enron.com,susan.scott@enron.com,Re: TW LFT,2000-05-17 09:15:00-07:00,sent
"Tony & Frazier -- several comments from TW Commercial.  Page 1:  Streamlined Credit -- what does ""interested parties"" mean? parties  interested in bidding, or parties interested in us having a look at their  credit ?  Probably need to make this clear; on first reading, looks like  obtaining credit approval ahead of time is optional.  (Don't we want everyone  to get approval ahead of bidding?).  Page 2:  you state that ""individual bid transactions are kept confidential.""   What is confidential:  the identity of the shipper?  the bid itself?  In TW's  IOS, we post the individual bids as they come in, but do not post the name of  the shipper.  We feel that the posting of the dollar amount bids helps us get  a higher rate as shippers bid against each other, and likewise recommend  online bids be posted in real time.  I notice you call them ""sealed bids"" on  page 4 -- not true if we're going to show them.  Page 3:  why not request a little more emphatically that shippers establish  creditworthiness at least several days in advance of bidding?  Especially  since we plan to attract brand-new shippers by offering this service.  Our  credit dept. folks would probably appreciate not having to do it all between  2 and 4 on bid day.  If we're asking that shippers submit bids to 3 decimal places, our example  should be to 3 decimal places (e.g., $0.351).  Page 7:  ""an"" Capacity Trading Agreement should be ""a"" Capacity Trading  Agreement.  Page 8:  So we don't appear low-tech, let's go ahead and tell shippers we  plan to have the Request for Service and the service agreement available for  online submittal at some point in the near future.  Also, we've never asked shippers to submit a Request for Service with each  bid.  A shipper may bid and re-bid several times over the bidding process.   They really only need to submit the Request for Service at the time of, or  prior to, the first bid.  I recommend stating ""You must submit a Request for  Service prior to making your initial bid"" so they don't think they have to  submit a new one every time they revise their bid.  Page 9:  Under ""When TW will Respond"":  need to specify how notification will  be sent.    Page 14:  Column that says ""Price"" should say ""Rate"" (for a second there we  thought you were talking about gas prices).  Also, please use example rates  that are more realistic for TW (in the $0.240 to $0.299 would be great...)  Thanks for all your hard work on this.

" When the Commission granted Texas Eastern authority to hold capacity on  another pipeline in Texas Eastern Transmission Corporation, 74 FERC P 61,074  (1996), it stated that when a pipeline holds capacity on an upstream  pipeline, the downstream pipeline's customers may hold title to the gas  transported on the upstream pipeline.  The Commission recognized this as one  of the limited exceptions to the shipper must have title rule.  Specifically,  the Commission stated:    The downstream pipeline will not hold title to gas shipped on capacity it has  acquired on an upstream  pipeline. Rather, shippers on the downstream pipeline will hold title to the  gas on the upstream  pipeline. We will allow a pipeline to hold the upstream capacity; we will  not, however, allow the pipeline  to hold title to the gas being shipped.  Thus, the downstream pipeline will  be the shipper on the upstream  pipeline, but will not hold title when the gas is being shipped. This results  in a limited exception to the rule  that a shipper must hold title to gas being shipped.   I believe that if we can address the Commission's other concerns about this  filing, they will grant a similar waiver for this transaction.

"In response to your inquiries about whether TW's tariff allows the format  posting, bidding and awarding of capacity in our EnronOnline proposal, here  is my 2 cents' worth.  The criteria for awarding capacity is found in the Right of First Refusal  section of TW's tariff (for some reason that's never been clear to me). See  Section 13.A. (Sheet No. 18):  ""All available capacity shall be allocated  under these procedures, and Transporter will not maintain a firm  transportation queue.""  The ROFR section does specify the posting and bidding  procedures (including a minimum one month period between posting and the bid  deadline -- See Section 13.D.) but arguably these timelines only apply to the  ROFR bidding process, not to an open season for other capacity.  Even if the  one-month minimum bid period did apply outside the ROFR process, the  EnronOnline proposal complies by giving shippers at least a month to submit  bids (Tony -- am I right about this?).  The only other relevant part of our tariff is the EBB/Internet section of the  General Terms and Conditions (beginning on Sheet No. 72).   TW will continue  to comply with all provisions in this section.  The section even specifically  provides that shippers may request service and contract electronically.  I've found nothing in else in TW's tariff that would appear to address an  online open season one way or the other.  I believe our tariff gives us the  flexibility to sell capacity online as we've proposed to do.  Hope this helps.

"Since the contract quantity goes to zero in Nov.-Mar., they pay no  reservation charge in those months, so effectively the rate is zero for those  months.  I suppose we could draft it either way and logistically it would  work.  We used a similar structure in a deal we did earlier this year, if I  recall correctly.  Also --  I agree that we would need to file this as a material deviation if  SWG agrees to include the capacity release provision.

Now Socal will try to poll the parties so as to prepare a consensus Exhibit that will put ""fact"" to the upstream capacities into the Socal system. Well, I fear that the other pipeline lines will shape the facts to their agendas and we will have a distorted landscape into the Socal system. The downside I perceive is that the judge will 1) want to Let the Market decide via increasing the maximum receipt point capacity allowed  or 2) want further comments on the entire Socal receipt point capacity structure. These two onerous outcomes can be avoided if the judge receives a consensus Exhibit(at least from the Settlement parties) that is explained in a consistent manner  and with common terms.

"Tony, I thought there would be a case that stated that if an interstate  pipeline posts the criteria under which it will evaluate capacity bids, it  must stick to those criteria and not award the capacity to a bidder on some  other basis.  It seems a simple enough extension of the principle that  capacity must be awarded on a nondiscriminatory basis.  However, I did not  find any case that stands for that exact proposition.  As you may be aware,  the Commission made Natural Gas Pipeline Company of America (NGPL) come up  with a way to ensure that it awarded capacity one a nondiscriminatory  basis...because NGPL was found to have been giving preferential treatment to  its shippers.  NGPL's solution was to come up with an auction process, and  there is a whole line of cases if you're interested.  The underlying  presumption is that if you set up a system under which all capacity is  awarded and stick with that system, there is no way you could be acting  discriminatorily.  But of course the Commission never comes out and says this  even though it should be obvious.  Probably the best we can do is extrapolate from 1) the tariff and 2) the NGA  (doesn't it also say we have to provide service on a not unduly discrim.  basis?).  Also, in your memo I'd give an example; i.e., if we notify shippers  of our auction process and set a deadline for bidding, but then award the  capacity to Sempra (assuming Sempra requested capacity after the posting), we  will have unduly discriminated against all the other shippers who had to  participate in the auction process.    Maybe in future postings on Enrononline we should include a statement to the  effect that the capacity posted will not be awarded except thru the  Enrononline process.  Now for some trivia.  Remember we were discussing with Shelley whether we  could post a different method (other than that prescribed in the tariff) for  determining best bid?  In my Westlaw search I ran across the relevant case.   In Northwest Pipeline, 85 FERC P 61,335, the Commission stated:  ""The  Commission has previously given pipelines the leeway, in open season  provisions, to either include in their tariff a single non-discriminatory bid  evaluation methodology, or provide themselves the flexibility of choosing  different non-discriminatory bid evaulation methods for different  transactions, provided that the pipeline posts the bid evaluation methodology  before the bidding process begins.""  The only problem is I am not sure we  have that ""flexibility"" since the tariff does not expressly allow us to post  a different method.  Maybe next time we do a tariff cleanup we could add some  language allowing us to do so.  I have to move on to my next project but if you want me to comment on what  you write I'd be happy to.

"Phil Richardson and Sarah Tomalty of Dynegy say that they would probably  (i.e. subject to management approval) withdraw their protest if we would  amend our proposed tariff language to limit the quantity of capacity we can  acquire from PNM to 20,000/day.  Their chief concern is to prevent TW from  becoming simply a broker for another pipeline's capacity (which has never  been our intention).  Lorraine is discussing this with Steve to see whether  this is something we could live with.

"Susan, Thanks for the draft exhibit. My first comment is that the general approach taken by Socal tends to ""generalize"" the Socal receipt points by noting all upstream pipeline market possibilities. I think this is helpful in that we should stay focused on the Socal structure and not worry about upstream mismatches. All receipt points apparently are mismatched so they all are similarly situated. It would therefore be of no particular use for the ALJ to dwell on this topic to long in this proceeding.  Some additional comments;  Wheeler Ridge - Incoming Interstate Capacity : ok , K/M testimony unchallenged at 1 bcf/d     - Take Away : PG&E No.Cal assumes full displacement volumes and bi-directional flow                             capacity of at least 200 mmcfd                             K/M to PG&E - list 200 mmcfd , I know it has physically done over         350 mmcfd         Hector Rd. - ok         K/M to Las Vegas should be closer to 200 mmcfd  Hector Road - Strike the asterisk and comment concerning Hector deliveries limited by TW.

We appreciate your work on it and generally agree with  the exhibit and the approach taken by SoCalGas.  However, we think it  appropriate to balance simplicity with the need to be responsive to Judge  Biren's questions.    See the attached marked-up version of the exhibit.  We've attempted to  streamline the data provided for ""non-Wheeler"" points, and to clarify the  footnotes regarding Wheeler Ridge.  Also, we've modified the numbers  regarding the TW Topock lateral to accurately reflect the lateral's 400  MMcf/d physical capability.  We've also made some minor formatting changes.

"Good Morning Susan, I presume Norm is asking the same type of question of each of the upstream pipelines. If his ""game"" is to balance upstream firm rights to specific Socal points , TW should be in an excellent net position against the other parties. Let's review, PG&E has an estimated 160 to 210 mmcfd of firm KRS shippers currently, EPNG has a FERC documented problem and arguably only 540 @Topock and 1210 @ Blythe, Mojave has 0 mmcfd at Hector RD. as documented in this proceeding, Kern uses a specified firm delivery point in their shipper agreements, therefore shippers like Reliant at SCE'S old Coolwater Plant would specify the Coolwater Station as their delivery point and not Socal Wheeler Ridge. I estimate the upper end of Kern shippers specifying Wheeler Ridge as their firm delivery point is 325 mmcfd.  I am available today, to discuss these matters. I'll be out tomorrow.  Another approach to Norm's question is to form our response as : Under the current Socal windowing structure, primary rights ""into"" Socal are unavailable.

"Mike -- Thanks for the input...we stewed over this for a while but decided to  respond (as briefly as possible) rather than give Norm a chance to whine to  the judge that we were being uncooperative in this somewhat unusual exhibit  drafting process.  Jeff's answer is consistent with what will appear in the  exhibit (and from what one can find out about TW in numerous of our FERC  filings, for that matter).  If Norm tries somehow to make Jeff's response  part of the record you can bet I will object...if it's not on the record  already, or on the face of this one late-filed exhibit, it should not be  allowed into the record.   Apparently Norm has also called Rich Hall with annoying questions. I don't plan to respond if he contacts us with any follow-up, but will let  you know if he does.

Be advised that Norm is a little out of order asking discovery questions like this after the record is closed.  You are not obligated to respond to him under these circumstances.  He is still trying to buttress his apparent belief that the EPNG and TW capacity to the California border is completely fungible and can be delivered to either SoCal or PG&E without any limitations.  Please let me know if he tries this again.  Thanks, Mike  -----Original Message----- From: Susan.Scott@enron.com [mailto:Susan.Scott@enron.com] Sent: Thursday, June 15, 2000 2:17 PM To: Norman A.

As you know, currently SoCalGas doesn't assign ""primary rights"" to deliveries off of any interconnecting pipeline. The establishment of tradeable rights for intrastate capacity is among the issues currently under consideration in the GIR proceeding.   However, if what you are asking about is what has been the historical or otherwise available receipt capacity for Transwestern deliveries at North Needles, then let me offer the following.  Transwestern has always operated on the premise that SoCalGas could physically accept up to a maximum of 750 MMcf/d at its North Needles receipt point.  Consequently, Transwestern has sold firm transportation to its interstate customers for west flow deliveries to North Needles not to exceed the 750 MMcf/d limitation.  Our west flow mainline capacity is 1.09 Bcf/d.       ""Norman A.

In the deal, Enron will provide both gas and electric commodities to Hades' facilities throughout and under North America.  John D. Rockefeller, former CEO of energy monopolist Standard Oil, is now head of Hades' energy management division.  Said Rockefeller, ""Obviously Hell has significant heating demands.  While eternal flames are a great idea in concept, they require vast and reliable fuel resources.  Enron was the only supplier willing to make a deal with my boss, and, as a former monopolist, I just like the way they do business."" A spokesperson for Enron said the two cultures were able to work easily together during negotiations.  According to the company, ""The deal fits both companies exceptionally well.  With Hades' ability to attract and retain new customers, we see this as a fabulous growth opportunity for millennia to come.""  According to several energy industry insiders, Hades' high heating demand with very little need for summer air conditioning make it a very attractive energy portfolio addition. Hades is a multinational corporation with millions of sites worldwide and approximately 173 quintillion customers.  The entity boasts sustained high growth rates over the last two thousand years. Enron is one of the world's leading energy and communications companies. The company owns approximately $37 billion in energy and communications assets.  Enron ranks in the top quarter of Fortune's ""Best 100 Companies to Work For if You Can Keep A Job There and Don't Mind Working 80 Hours A Week,"" and is among the most respected corporations in America, as ranked by customers with respect-us-or-get-curtailed clauses in their energy supply contracts.

I.99-07-003 - EPNG Revisions To SoCalGas Draft Exh 28 re Pipeline  Capacity   Attached is an e-mail containing revisions and additions El Paso recommends be made to SoCalGas' draft Exhibit 28 which was distributed for further comment  to parties on June 16, 2000.  This e-mail has two attachments.  The first  attachment is a revised copy of SoCalGas' table titled ""Firm Pipeline Capacity into  Southern California"" with changes to:  (a) correct the amount of firm interstate  capacity on El Paso at Topock, shown in the col. ""Incoming Interstate Capacity,"" by  replacing the incorrect figure, 2230 MMcfd (which includes capacity for delivery to SW  Gas which is not available to California on a firm basis) with the correct  figure,  2080 MMcfd; (b) delete the reference to El Paso delivery capacity to SW Gas from  the col. ""Total Take-away Capacity"" since this capacity is not firm capacity  available to California; (c) adjust the totals at the bottom of both cols. affected by  these changes; (d) add a new footnote to reference to the fact that shippers on El  Paso have existing firm contract rights for delivery from El Paso at Topock to  SoCalGas totaling 1466 MMcfd which exceeds SoCalGas' take-away capacity at Topock and clearly creates a ""mismatch""; and (c) add reference in footnote (2) to the physical capacity of Kern/Mojave at the interconnection with SoCalGas at Wheeler Ridge South, which is in excess of 680 MMcfd even though the metering is currently set to 500 MMcfd.   The second attachment contains two schematics intended to supplement SoCalGas' draft map of receipt points and interconnections.  These schematics more accurately reflect the actual  physical interconnections at Topock and Hector Ridge and correct both the inaccurate impression that the interconnect with  El Paso at Topock consists of several separate pipelines with no cross over, and that inaccurate impression that  several interconnections may exist between pipelines at Hector Road .   El Paso understands and acknowledges that there are a number of possible responses to Administrative Law Judge Biren's request for a late filed exhibit concerning ""mismatches"" and pipeline capacity upstream and downstream from SoCalGas receipt points.  In the spirit of compromise, El Paso  will not oppose  SoCalGas filing an exhibit as proposed 6/16/00 provided it is revised to reflect the  changes and additions El Paso has proposed in this e-mail.

I am the marketing director in Houston for  Transwestern Pipeline.  I have a favor to ask of you: could you possibly send  me only those tariff page copies slated for ""insertion"" into our tariff books  and not the pages that are ""submitted for filing""?    My reason is this: by the time the ""submitted for filing"" pages get to me,  it's too late for me to make any changes to them (not that I would anyway)  and they just get tossed out when the final pages are approved and printed.  If keeping up with a separate distribution list is not feasible I  understand.  However, I wonder how many other folks feel the same way as I  do?  If the number of people is significant, then there is the potential to  save a lot of time, effort, and money by reducing the copying, printing, and  distribution costs.

"Attached is a preliminary draft of a filing for capacity options on  Transwestern.  The attachments include a filing letter, proposed tariff  language and a proposed form agreement.  Obviously there are still quite a few details to be worked out.  I am  distributing a draft at this early stage in hopes of initiating a dialogue  about the larger issues first.  A few that come to mind are whether we want  to commit to selling options online, how best to explain or justify the  option fee, and what specifically in the industry has changed such that FERC  should depart from existing policy and allow TW to essentially reserve future  capacity for shippers.  Please let me know your thoughts on these and any  other issues.

"With regard to capacity release I think we will have to give the replacement  shipper the cash-for-fuel option, because what if we have sold capacity that  was created by the releasing shipper's buying fuel from us?  If the  replacement shipper suddenly starts shipping fuel, that capacity goes away.   (It's sort of like the EFBH/resulting forward haul problem).  Probably we  should require that the cash for fuel election automatically transfer to the  replacement shipper.  This would probably have to go into our tariff  someplace when we make our FERC filing; otherwise it might run contrary to  our current tariff provisions and practice.  Another solution might be to  just sell resulting capacity as LFT, daily FTS-1 or even FTS-3 capacity (with  some modifications to the FTS-3 Rate Schedule, of course), which would allow  us the flexibility not to schedule on certain days.  For longer-term deals  this might not be practicable, though.    Further questions...let me know.

We had  several open issues that came up in our discussions and they are as follows:  Regulatory/Legal issue: Can we have contract specific language on our firm  contracts that would prevent the firm shipper from releasing this fuel  discount  cash option to an acquiring shipper?     If we must offer this  special cash option to the acquiring shipper we will need to build a process  to track this fuel option from the firm shipper to the releasing shipper.  This will require more system modifications that we have not accounted for at  this time.  Shipper nomination issue: How will we handle shipper nomination line items  that are nominated as overrun paths on their firm contracts?  Could we  default these ""02"" overrun transactions to calculate the fuel in kind using  our existing tariff fuel %?  This would  make the process of trying to  reconcile the contracted MDQ fuel volumes easier when we verify that the  volumes the shipper elected to pay in cash tie back to the total volumes  scheduled & paid for in cash..  Tariff Sheet issue:  When you state in the tariff provision that ""The shipper  may use the cash for fuel option only if the posted point of sale is a  receipt point on shipper's service agreement"" Does this only apply to the  shipper's primary receipt points?  I would appreciate it if you could respond to these issues. If you feel like  we should meet to discuss, I will be glad to set up another meeting. Please  let me know.

"Ramona, ""total cost commitment"" in TW's tariff generally means total revenue  to be received from a transaction, taking  into account reservation rate, the term of the commitment, and the commodity  revenues associated with any minimum  throughput commitment the shipper may make.  Obviously some of these items  aren't applicable in the PNR context; the  language must have just been lifted from another part of the tariff.  For PNR  we would just multiply rate times number  of days the service will be used.  Practically speaking, I'm not sure how  this is done if you have an interruptible service with  no throughput commitment, but I think you should just be able to use the  number of days in the contract term.    If there's a tie (i.e. more than one shipper willing to pay at or above max  rate), we just allocate the capacity pro-rata.  We  do not have to offer a right to match.

We state that  buyers willing to pay more than the maximum tariff rate will be considered to  be paying the maximm rate and we will pro-rate amoung buyers willing to pay  the same total cost commitment.

Pursuant to Sempra's Gallup Expansion Agreement  allowing Sempra the right to ""call"" upon SoCalNeedles capacity, subject to  availability, at a $.30 rate,  Sempra has requested to obtain 23,000 Dth/d of  East of Thoreau (EOT) to SoCalNeedles capacity for the July - October term.   Sempra's blended rate of $.2928 represents 21,500 Dth/d of capacity at  $.30/Dth (their ""call"" capacity) and 1,500 Dth/d of additional Needles  capacity sold to them at $.19/Dth.  Non-standard provisions contained in Sempra's original Gallup expansion  Agreement  are included in the discount letter and contained in Paragraphs 3  and 4:   Paragragh 3 grants Sempra the ability to have alternate delivery points in  Transwestern's EOT Area at the discounted rate in situations where SoCalGas'  ""window""  can be shown to reduce Sempra's nominated deliveries to SoCalGas.   Sempra must provide Transwestern a written confirmation from SoCalGas  indicating a reduction in scheduled volumes in order to obtain such alternate  delivery capacity at the discounted rate.  If written confirmation is either  not provided or Sempra elects to transport on an alternate basis to the EOT  Area due to favorable market conditions, then the rate for such transport  shall be the discounted rate plus $.01.  Paragragh 4 grants Sempra the ability during the term of the July - October  transportation agreement, to move their primary delivery point from  SoCalNeedles to PG&E/Topock, Mojave /Topock, or to the potential SWG  interconnect subject to capacity availability and a 5 day notification  period.

"Here is a quick summary of our meeting on capacity options on TW.  Bill  Cordes, Steve Harris, Shelley Corman, John Buchanan, Tony Pryor, and members  of the TW Commercial Group (including Jeff Fawcett) were present.   1.  The group all agreed that while it is probably a good idea to mention  that the options could be sold in an online format, we do not want to limit  ourselves at this point and should probably just state that a notice will be  posted on the TW website whenever we have options for sale.   2.  Price:  the filing needs to include a discussion of how price will be  determined, and how capacity will be awarded.  We might also need to include  an estimate of how much revenue options will generate in the first year.   3.  Need to add a short explanation of where TW will get the capacity if a  shipper exercises its call option.   4.  Should frame the service as requiring an exception to current Commission  policy on reserving capacity...not asking Commission to abandon its policy  altogether.   5.  May need to address:  assignability of options; limitation on damages  for nonperformance.   6.  Timeline:   - Turn around a new draft and get further comments (July 3 week)   - Get Market Services started on its analysis of the new service    - Begin contacting customers to get their buy-in (Lorraine already has a  producer/customer very interested in supporting our filing)   - Start the process of getting Board approval (sales of options require  Board approval at Enron)   - Meet informally with FERC to discuss (Shelley is working on)   - Make the filing at FERC (we did not try to specify a date yet)  If you have any further comments please let me know.

"Hi yourself,  Glad to hear you all had a good time in Thailand, although I get the  impression you could have done without some of the sights.  Mom thinks it  must be fate that this guy and I keep bumping into each other.  Along those lines, I had an absolutely incredible weekend.  I drove to  Harlingen Saturday morning/afternoon (5 hr. drive) for a friend's wedding and  then drove to Austin to meet up with Emily on Sunday.  We ate at Guerro's and  then hit Cedar door for a little while.  There wasn't anything going on there  so I suggested we try Cedar Street.  Funny thing is Ted, that's his name,  walks by our table at the bar.  He stopped to say hello and ended up sitting  down with us the rest of the evening.  His friends joined us as soon as they  had been shot down by the girls they had been trying to woo.  We ended up  going to Polly Esters for a little while to do some dancing.  Before we  parted ways he asked if we had any plans for Monday night and got my cell  phone number.  Needless to say I was feeling pretty good.  He called us  Monday and we made plans to meet up after dinner -- we ate at Sullivan's, it  was very good.  His birthday is July 4 (how great is that?) so I brought him  one of those travel size bottles of Crown from the honor bar as a birthday  gift...Big Hit.  Anyway, spent the whole night talking and getting to know  each other and all I can say is he seems like a really good guy.  (One of the  best signs was his reproach of denim shorts on guys, especially cut-offs...be  sure and tell Chuck about that one because I know it's something he feels  pretty strongly about as well.)  So at this point I'll pretty much just run  through the stats:  Height :   6'2"" - 6'3"" Weight : about 225 lbs. Education: UCLA (undergraduate and MBA) AND Law School ( I'm not sure where) Birthday: 7/4/69 -- YES, he was born in a different decade than me...think it  may be more of an issue for him than me. Hometown: Santa Barbara, CA  ETC:  Youngest of three children.  Appears to like/be close to his family.   Irish Catholic (we actually discussed religion)   His dad was in the Navy   Favorite Movies -- Fletch, Caddy Shack...he definitely has a good sense of  humor and likes to laugh   He really likes Texas...would like to have a ranch/lakehouse somewhere in  the hill country  Best Quotes:    ""Every California guys idea of a dream girl is a girl in  jeans a t-shirt and cowboy boots.""    ""Every Texas girls idea of a dream guy is a guy who lives on a ranch, has  an good education, is comfortable financially and is also a great     businessman.  Only problem is there are only four of those guys out there and  three of them are married.""   ""Texas girls have the ability to wrap a man around their finger quicker  than any group of women I've ever met.""   ""I really want to learn how to two step.""    So, as I'm sure you can tell there are definitely some attractive  characteristics to this guy (to boot he was a complete gentleman in every  capacity).  There are no plans as of yet, but I will be sure to keep you  informed of any progress.  Write back soon and let me know how the apartment,  the job hunt and everything else is going.

We saw some pretty ronchy things there, too.  I'm not sure it if were the old men with the young boys and a million of those clubs or if the clubs ""featuring"" women were worse.

"Attached is a revised draft of TW's capacity option filing.  I thought the  comments I received last week were very helpful, and pursuant to our  discussion I've added language addressing rates, limitation of liability, and  the necessary exception to Commission policy.  Some of the language will  probably need to be expanded or changed.  I have also included a section in  the tariff cross-referencing applicable General Terms and Conditions.  The  letter and tariff sheets are redlined; I did not make significant changes to  the agreement.  I have not come up with a projected filing date yet; I believe it is  important first to plan our pre-filing communication with customers as well  as informal discussions with FERC staff.  I will be contacting some of you to  coordinate these efforts, and this should help us decide on a reasonable date.  Market Services:  Because this filing is still just a draft and may change  based on what we hear from customers, I will just continue to keep you in the  loop and will leave it up to you to decide when and with whom to meet in  order to get the information you need.

"Lorraine, I have no problem with Larry's proposed change or his reasons for  the change.  However, I would ask that we eliminate the word ""volumetric"" as  that has other connotations in the FERC tariff world.

I don't think it's necessary  in order to convey Larry's meaning.  Why don't we insert:  ""on a daily basis   only   to the volumes for which such other alternate points are utilized"".   If Larry wants to talk about it I'm happy to.  If he comes up with any more  issues I am sending him to law school as punishment.

I am visualizing a  nomination day with part of the volumes from Primary or one of these  specified points and part of the volumes from some other unspecified  alternate point.

"Good news:  I've just received word that the FERC has issued an order denying  SoCal's request for rehearing of the Gallup order.  FERC also ordered that  TW's request for rehearing (which asked the Commission not to require TW to  disclose discounted rates) is now moot because we filed a discount report at  the time required by Section 284.7(b)(6) of the Commission's rules (as we  always do).    If SoCal is still feeling vindictive, they can file an appeal in the D.C.  Circuit.  I believe their window is 60 days.

As soon as HR learns of employee acceptance of a transfer, HR sends an email  notice to this distribution list.   Legal contacts the employee to set up an exit interview (or entrance  interview in the case of employees returning to GPG).  At the interview the  pipeline attorney will the employee a copy of the training materials & the  respective pipeline's Standards of Conduct.  In addition, the pipeline  attorney will instruct the employee to return any pipeline-related email  messages with a reply that message has not been opened and asking to be  removed from the distribution list in light of the employee transfer. Legal initiates, completes and retains the checklist forms. Legal sends an email to the Helpdesk and asks for an email reply when access  has been disabled.  A copy of this email is attached to the form.  We can  keep a master GPG employee transfer file in the 47th floor conference room.  Here are the electronic transfer forms:     Here is an electronic copy of the training package:     Attached below is a sample of the email notice sent to the Helpdesk.   I'd appreciate your feedback on this gameplan.  We still need to sort out an  arrangement on who should conduct interviews.  Frazier handles Citrus/FGT; I  handle GPG/OTS.  I'm not sure who handles ET&S Houston?   I also need your  feedback on how we are going to pull all the 1999 transfer forms together.

"Hi Mum.  Sept. 29 sounds great; I have always wanted to see Chorus Line.  So  go ahead and order tickets if you like.    I think I might be skiing in the Park City area in December.  Allie's wedding  is Dec. 16.  at Sundance.  If you and Eric planned your trip then, you and I  could hit the bunny slopes together.  I want to take lessons, and stick to  the easy runs.  No way am I getting more injuries; I am creaky enough as it  is.  Bill is still hoping to go to Sweden in September to buy his Volvo wagon.  I  have really lost my enthusiasm for the trip and would rather go to Mexico,  and have told him so.  So I'm not sure what will happen.  Are you interested  in going to San Miguel for the running of the bulls?  Hope the Hip Abductors are not demanding too much as ransom.  Love, Sooz     Camp2scott@aol.com on 07/13/2000 10:32:35 AM To: Susan.Scott@enron.com cc:    Subject: planning   Hi, Sooz!  What are you doing Sat, Sept 29?  Was just checking over the Broadway series at the Paramount, and ""Chorus Line"" is coming for a 2-wk period.  I would love to see it.  I could probably find someone to go with on a weeknight, but would prefer going with you if you're available.  Let me know.  I'll be leaving for Calif a few days later, Oct 3.  Eric had a fatty tumor removed from just under his shoulder Mon.  Called him when I returned from Houston to check on him and he surprised and shocked me by saying he was not skiing with his L.A. group this year, and wants me to go on some ski trips with him.  It's one of those things you wish for, and then you get it?  Oh no.  I don't even know if I'll really progress past the beginner slope, but am sure I'll be very good at apres.  I think he's considering Park City for the first one.  He says the transportation there is good, and it's a good place for me to learn.  Darrell went with me to The Hills Tues. and I discovered the Hip Abductors! Wow.  Didn't feel the workout until after my walk last night.  Sure hope all this is doing some good.  Checked their long list of reciprocal clubs, and The Met isn't one of them, but that doesn't matter.  You can still go as a guest.  (Neither is the Los Gatos Ath. Club.)  Must check out exercises for skiing.  Went to the lab early this a.m. for pre-physical tests.  Had a late lunch yesterday and no dinner, so I was starved when I woke up.  They opened at 7:00 and there wasn't much of a wait.  Fabion had disappeared for a few weeks, and Mike had lined up another guy to mow for us, but Fabion showed up--he had been in Mexico.  Sure glad to see him.  He's from some town near San Miguel.  K, J & G are coming for an overnight Sat.  Karin has a haircut appt.  Glad for the company.  Mother's a/c went out in her car as she was leaving Austin on the 5th.  All that way to Houston in the heat.  At least she left early.  She just spent $800 for a new compressor for that old heap.  Couldn't believe it.  She had just spent $200 for freon on her previous trip--it all leaked out.  Even with her other gas guzzler, $1000 would have gone a long way paying for gas.

"Drew -- I've looked at this and it is fine; really does not deviate from what  we have posted before.  One issue that arose Friday was whether our all-or-nothing approach (i.e.,  shipper must take all 49,000 dth of capacity or none at all -- or all 20,000  or none at all) constitutes tying.  The 49,000 package includes 35,000 to  North Needles and 14,000 to Topock.  So if a shipper wants the Needles space  it has to take the Topock space too.  This looked like a clear case of tying  to me until I remembered that this capacity is now, and has been, posted and  available and any shipper can bid on any part of the Needles space right now  if they wanted to and we'd sell it to them without making them take the  Topock space.  That'll be true during the IOS too -- i.e., nothing can stop  shippers from bidding on the Needles space outside of the IOS process.  This  is just a situation in which we're putting a special package together with  the expectation that the price will reflect the fact that the less desirable  Topock space is part of that package.    Does this make sense to you?  If not, give me a call.

The next day the kids came back and one  by one began to tell their stories.    Kathy said, ""My father's a farmer and we have a lot of  egg-laying hens.  One time we were taking our eggs to  market in a basket on the front seat of the pickup when  we hit a bump in the road and all the eggs went flying  and broke and made a mess.""  ""And what's the moral of  the story?"" Asked the teacher.  ""Don't put all your eggs  in one basket!""  ""Very good,"" said the teacher.    ""Now, Lucy?""    ""Our family are farmers too.  But we raise chickens for  the meat market.  We had a dozen eggs one time, but when  they hatched we only got ten live chicks. And the moral  to this story is, don't count your chickens until they're  hatched.""  ""That was a fine story Lucy.""  ""Johnny do you have a story to share?""    ""Yes, ma'am, my daddy told me this story about my uncle Bob.   Uncle Bob was a pilot in Vietnam and his plane got hit.  He  had to bail out over enemy territory and all he had was a  bottle of whiskey, a machine gun and a machete. He drank the  whiskey on the way down so it wouldn't break and then he  landed right in the middle of 100 enemy troops.  He killed  seventy of them with the machine gun until he ran out of  bullets, then he killed twenty more with the machete till the  blade broke and then he killed the last ten with his bare hands."" ""Good heavens,"" said the horrified teacher, ""What kind of moral  did your daddy tell you from that horrible story?""  ""Don't fuck with Uncle Bob when he's been drinking.""

"I do not see any problems with the draft tariff sheets. My concerns are how  to implement this new service. We need to start meeting with  marketing/legal/regulatory to determine how we will implement this & define  the system requirements. Here are some of my questions:  If we recall & the nomination is still in place, then how do we allocate?  What are the allocation rules? How do we track the volumes/contracts that have been recalled? Who will  monitor this process? What type of process is needed to track recalls &  transporter call volumes? What is the timing for the recall notice? Can it occur after the gas day has  started? Will we have partial day recalls? Will the recall option & transporter put option carry over to the aquiring  shipper? What system changes are needed for capacity release? How do we require a shipper to take firm transport capacity? Will this have  some type of OFO notice similar to EFBH that requires the shipper to nominate? How will the invoice system be changed to handle the various option fee  processes? Will we store this information at a contract level in CBS or in  the rate system at a contract level? Who will load & monitor these fee  options? Do we need a new Rate Schedule?

Lindberg, Christine Stokes/ET&S/Enron@ENRON, TK  Lohman/ET&S/Enron@ENRON, Michelle Lokay/ET&S/Enron@Enron   Subject: Caithness Big Sandy LLC  TW and Caithness met in Denver this week for the first face-to-face meeting  between the parties.  The purpose of the meeting was to review the status of  the Caithness Big Sandy Project and to establish the next steps for moving  the project forward.  Caithness Corporation Caithness Corp. is a privately held company based in New York with a variety  of business interests.  The company is essentially a financial vehicle for  private investors.  Their energy segment currently owns 1,200 MW of  generation through renewable assets in California (geothermal at Coso, wind  in Tehachapi and Palm Springs) and a gas fired plant in South Carolina  jointly-owned by Florida Power & Light.  Big Sandy Project The Big Sandy Project is a proposed power plant to be located near Wickieup,  Arizona.  The project would be built in two phases- first phase would be 550  MW, with a gas load of approx. 80,000 MMBtu/d, and phase 2 would add another  170 MW for a total of 720 MW with a gas load of 120,000 MMBtu/d.  The proposed location of the plant is approximately 40 miles south of  Transwestern's pipeline.  The take-off point on Transwestern would be at/near  valve station #1008, approximately 15 miles downstream of compressor Station  #1.  The current estimate includes an alignment that follows Arizona state  highway 93 south to a location 2 miles southeast of Wickieup in the S/W 4 of  Section 5, T15N, R12W, Mohave County, Arizona.  There is a 500 KV  transmission line owned by WAPA that crosses the property.  This line is one  of the principal electric transmission systems in the Southwest and extends  from the Phoenix area to the Mead substation near Boulder City, NV.  I've  included a WAPA map below which indicates this line.  Also, on the site is a  water pipeline owned by the Cyprus Amax Bagdad mine.  Water for the plant  will come from an encapusulated water table through deep wells.  They have  currently dug the first two test wells, each capable of 500 cfm.  The power  plant will require approximately 3,500 cfm of water.  In addition to the  wells, the plant has several thousand-acre feet of water rights to surface  water from the Big Sandy River.  The project may also purchase water from the  Cyprus Bagdad water pipeline.  The chief geological feature of this area is the Big Sandy River and  associated wash.  The highway 93 roadbed follows along the river.  The area  includes rolling hills and is principally desert terrain, with some limited  agricultural and ranching interests.  Wickieup is a very small town with an  estimated population of 200.  Project Schedule Gas Turbine(s) ordered Westinghouse-Seimens  May 2000 Submit Environmental Impact Statement (EIS)  August 2000 Arrange financing     December 2000 EIS approval      March 2001 Construction begins     April 2001 Testing begins      July 2002 Commercial Operation     November 2002  There are two lead agencies for purposes of the project's EIS- the Bureau of  Land Management (BLM Kingman office) and the Western Area Power  Administration (WAPA).  There is only one endangered/threatened species known  to be present in the area.  Lateral Pipeline Alignment The most critical path item is the alignment of the lateral pipeline.  The  alignment (lateral pipeline route) must be included in the EIS to be filed  next month.  Caithness has spoken preliminarily with the Arizona Department  of Transportation (ADOT) and the agency is amenable to granting an easement  for the pipeline.  The problem appears to be in the limited amount of right  of way available.  Measured from the shoulder to the fenceline, there is only  a 70 ft. right of way available for construction.  Typically, pipelines  require a 100 ft. temporary construction easement and 50 ft. of permanent  right of way.  Preliminary discussions indicate another problem with this  alignment may be the roadway's routing within the wash of the riverbed.  If the highway 93 corridor is unsuitable for the pipeline, the second  alternative appears to be running the pipeline down the adjacent N/S section  line.  The problem with this approach is that as the line nears the site, the  routing would have to contend with the river bed and wash areas, possibly  necessitating deep burial and anchoring.  The other route would involve  following along the WAPA electric transmission corridor.  The only issue  there, aside from whether WAPA would permit the pipeline encroachment, is  whether there are safety and/or corrosion concerns associated with a high  pressure gas line located under a high voltage transmission system.  Other Preliminary Project Issues There are other fundamental issues to address.  The original concept was to  interconnect the proposed Transwestern lateral with El Paso's northern  mainline and the yet-to-be-constructed Questar Southern Trails Pipeline, both  of which lay adjacent to Transwestern's mainline.  Transwestern's original  estimate to construct a 16"" lateral pipeline and meter station ($20.3MM) was  based on the following specifications:  120 MMcf/d 450 psig delivery pressure, 900 psig inlet pressure  The meeting resulted in a revised set of specifications that now include a  higher 550 psig minimum delivery pressure (new technology Westinghouse  turbines).  In addition, our understanding is that EPNG's system operates at  a pressure 100-150 psig lower than Transwestern's.  In order to accommodate  EPNG deliveries and to account for the new higher minimum pressure, the  design will likely change to a 20"" pipeline.

"Tony, the idea we had discussed at our meeting with Drew was somehow  acquiring capacity on El Paso in order to access the South Needles  interconnect with SoCal.  Currently SoCal lets El Paso deliver to S. Needles  but does not extend the same privilege to TW.      I'm unsure how it would work.  TW does have a couple of interconnects with El  Paso's system.  I would simply say in the memo that one solution to the  constraint at Topock might be to get some shippers to switch to South  Needles, and deliver gas to South Needles after twisting SoCal's arm and  letting us in, or somehow acquiring capacity on El Paso (or otherwise using  their system) to access South Needles.

I believe the answer is that SWGas will always be billed based on the  one-part rate, regardless of how we choose to allocate the rate components.

We have agreed that TWPL would allocate the rate between fixed and variable components.  I have never been clear on just when and how that will be done.  I have assumed you would make that call, let us know, and it would be over.  Is there any idea that issue would be a changing thing, or is it ""once done, always done""?  Further, what factors do you use to make that determination and what, if any, rules and regulations apply?

Lindberg, Christine Stokes/ET&S/Enron@ENRON, TK  Lohman/ET&S/Enron@ENRON, Michelle Lokay/ET&S/Enron@Enron   Subject: Caithness Big Sandy LLC  TW and Caithness met in Denver this week for the first face-to-face meeting  between the parties.  The purpose of the meeting was to review the status of  the Caithness Big Sandy Project and to establish the next steps for moving  the project forward.  Caithness Corporation Caithness Corp. is a privately held company based in New York with a variety  of business interests.  The company is essentially a financial vehicle for  private investors.  Their energy segment currently owns 1,200 MW of  generation through renewable assets in California (geothermal at Coso, wind  in Tehachapi and Palm Springs) and a gas fired plant in South Carolina  jointly-owned by Florida Power & Light.  Big Sandy Project The Big Sandy Project is a proposed power plant to be located near Wickieup,  Arizona.  The project would be built in two phases- first phase would be 550  MW, with a gas load of approx. 80,000 MMBtu/d, and phase 2 would add another  170 MW for a total of 720 MW with a gas load of 120,000 MMBtu/d.  The proposed location of the plant is approximately 40 miles south of  Transwestern's pipeline.  The take-off point on Transwestern would be at/near  valve station #1008, approximately 15 miles downstream of compressor Station  #1.  The current estimate includes an alignment that follows Arizona state  highway 93 south to a location 2 miles southeast of Wickieup in the S/W 4 of  Section 5, T15N, R12W, Mohave County, Arizona.  There is a 500 KV  transmission line owned by WAPA that crosses the property.  This line is one  of the principal electric transmission systems in the Southwest and extends  from the Phoenix area to the Mead substation near Boulder City, NV.  I've  included a WAPA map below which indicates this line.  Also, on the site is a  water pipeline owned by the Cyprus Amax Bagdad mine.  Water for the plant  will come from an encapusulated water table through deep wells.  They have  currently dug the first two test wells, each capable of 500 cfm.  The power  plant will require approximately 3,500 cfm of water.  In addition to the  wells, the plant has several thousand-acre feet of water rights to surface  water from the Big Sandy River.  The project may also purchase water from the  Cyprus Bagdad water pipeline.  The chief geological feature of this area is the Big Sandy River and  associated wash.  The highway 93 roadbed follows along the river.  The area  includes rolling hills and is principally desert terrain, with some limited  agricultural and ranching interests.  Wickieup is a very small town with an  estimated population of 200.  Project Schedule Gas Turbine(s) ordered Westinghouse-Seimens  May 2000 Submit Environmental Impact Statement (EIS)  August 2000 Arrange financing     December 2000 EIS approval      March 2001 Construction begins     April 2001 Testing begins      July 2002 Commercial Operation     November 2002  There are two lead agencies for purposes of the project's EIS- the Bureau of  Land Management (BLM Kingman office) and the Western Area Power  Administration (WAPA).  There is only one endangered/threatened species known  to be present in the area.  Lateral Pipeline Alignment The most critical path item is the alignment of the lateral pipeline.  The  alignment (lateral pipeline route) must be included in the EIS to be filed  next month.  Caithness has spoken preliminarily with the Arizona Department  of Transportation (ADOT) and the agency is amenable to granting an easement  for the pipeline.  The problem appears to be in the limited amount of right  of way available.  Measured from the shoulder to the fenceline, there is only  a 70 ft. right of way available for construction.  Typically, pipelines  require a 100 ft. temporary construction easement and 50 ft. of permanent  right of way.  Preliminary discussions indicate another problem with this  alignment may be the roadway's routing within the wash of the riverbed.  If the highway 93 corridor is unsuitable for the pipeline, the second  alternative appears to be running the pipeline down the adjacent N/S section  line.  The problem with this approach is that as the line nears the site, the  routing would have to contend with the river bed and wash areas, possibly  necessitating deep burial and anchoring.  The other route would involve  following along the WAPA electric transmission corridor.  The only issue  there, aside from whether WAPA would permit the pipeline encroachment, is  whether there are safety and/or corrosion concerns associated with a high  pressure gas line located under a high voltage transmission system.  Other Preliminary Project Issues There are other fundamental issues to address.  The original concept was to  interconnect the proposed Transwestern lateral with El Paso's northern  mainline and the yet-to-be-constructed Questar Southern Trails Pipeline, both  of which lay adjacent to Transwestern's mainline.  Transwestern's original  estimate to construct a 16"" lateral pipeline and meter station ($20.3MM) was  based on the following specifications:  120 MMcf/d 450 psig delivery pressure, 900 psig inlet pressure  The meeting resulted in a revised set of specifications that now include a  higher 550 psig minimum delivery pressure (new technology Westinghouse  turbines).  In addition, our understanding is that EPNG's system operates at  a pressure 100-150 psig lower than Transwestern's.  In order to accommodate  EPNG deliveries and to account for the new higher minimum pressure, the  design will likely change to a 20"" pipeline.

We have traditionally relied on verbal  communication, only if asked by the shipper,  of any potential alternate  rights associated with the primary capacity being auctioned.  I do not feel  that in this recent IOS process that any shipper had possibly NOT increased  their bid due to the impression that there was no additional flexibility  beyond  the primary path rights of the capacity being auctioned.  However,  I  do think that the TW commercial group should discuss how we communicate to  any interested party those alternate rights  associated with future IOS bids  or EnronOnline bids.

"Lorraine, here are a few notes from my review of the Val Verde contract, and  my initial impressions.  Let's talk more about how to approach the issue  after we meet with Ron tomorrow about MAOP.  12/31/92 Interconnect Agreement:  Sec. 1.3 specifies pressures and states that unless there is an agreement to  provide firm compression service TW will accept up to 200,000 on an  interruptible basis.  Sec. 2 states that the Blanco Hub MAOP shall not be exceeded.  Sec. 4.2 limits damages (no consequential damages).  The contract also has a fairly standard force majeure clause.  2/18/93 letter amendment:  Sec. 3 obligates TW to provide firm compression service in order to accept  200,000 into TW's system (provided MOGI has pressure of at least 650 and  quantity of at least 140).  Acknowledges that this is an agreement to provide  firm compression in accordance with Sec. 1.3 of 12/92 agreement.  9/25/95 letter amendment:  Increases quantity to be received at the interconnect to 250,000 once the San  Juan expansion is effective.  My initial conclusions:  It is pretty clear we have an obligation to accept  250,000 on a firm basis, provided that Burlington complies with the pressure  requirements.  Probably the only way we can avoid this obligation is if  accepting 250,000 would cause us to exceed the hub MAOP.  In that case we can  argue impossibility of performance.  Also, we could avoid the obligation  because the summer heat above certain temperatures constitutes force  majeure.  This argument is strengthened by the fact that temperatures seem to  have gotten hotter over the years.    The fact that we entered into our most recent agreement with Burlington in  January of this year weakens the credibility of our arguments (they will say  we should have known by now).  Burlington might try to argue that we have an  absolute obligation to comply with the agreement, even if it means expensive  system modifications.  That argument is not a very strong one because the  agreement contains no such affirmative obligation and in fact quite clearly  describes the facilities that are the subject of the agreement.",lorraine.lindberg@enron.com,susan.scott@enron.com,Burlington: PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL ATTORNEY-CLIENT  COMMUNICATION,2000-08-03 10:14:00-07:00,sent

These concerns may not constitute all of our concerns; I'm sure there will be more as we continue to review this proposal with our commercial people.  Also, they have not been reviewed with management, and may, or may not, represent the ultimate positions that Conoco (or the Indicated Shipper Trial Group) takes in any proceeding before the FERC.  Thanks again for inviting us to lunch yesterday.  Both Teddy and I found it to be very helpful and informative.  We look forward to a more detailed description of your proposal, and the ability to discuss it with Transwestern in a future customer meeting.  Please forward this e-mail on to Jeff; I don't have his direct e-mail address.  Tentative Regulatory Issues regarding Transwestern's Transport Option Program (""TOP"").  1. Market Based Rates.  To the extent that TW intends to offer the TOP service without a corresponding cost based recourse service, under current FERC policy, TW would need to make a filing that demonstrates a lack of market power. 2. Comparable Service:  To the extent that TW implements a TOP service, it would be highly advisable to provide that other FT holders be able to offer a similar call & put capability in the capacity release market.  As I remember TW's tariffs, this would likely require specific changes to the capacity release sections in order to allow prospective capacity releases with a call or put pricing option. 3. Hoarding:  The TOP service should not be a means for any party (particularly an affiliate) to manipulate the transportation market and/or to exert market power by withholding capacity. 4. Reliability:  The TOP service should require sufficient protections to ensure continued, undiminished service to all of TW's existing and future FT customers. 5. Standardized Product:  The terms and conditions for the TOP service should be standardized in order that each TOP service offer is not considered a ""non-conforming"" contract under FERC policy.  The call and put options, and any administrative or operating limitations, should be specifically defined. 6. Non-preferential Service:  TW must ensure that the TOP service is offered and administered in a manner that is fair and equitable, and in a manner that does not convey a preferential right to any party (particularly an affiliate). 7. Revenue:  Regardless of whether the TOP is a cost or market based rate, there will be a question as to where the revenue goes. 8. Pilot Program.  Given the precedential nature of this proposal, perhaps the industry would be more comfortable with the TOP if it were filed as an experimental program on TW, with a finite life.  This would allow parties to gain experience prior to having all of the Enron pipelines (and others) file for similar authority.  Thanks again.

"Attached is the latest draft of the Transport Option Program filing.  There are a couple of important changes from the last draft.  One is that we're no longer stating that the option fee is going to be  ""market-based.""  At FERC, the term ""market-based"" has connotations of having  to prove to FERC that a non-cost-based rate is appropriate because we lack  market power.  While we probably do lack market power, the consensus of the  legal/regulatory team was to try to portray the option fee as a built-in  feature of the transport rate, which is simply being disaggregated into a  separate option fee.  If this theory is not clear to you after you read the  filing letter, let's discuss how it should be improved.  The other significant change (also based on my meeting with legal/regulatory)  is that I've structured the tariff language and the agreement so that every  shipper, regardless of whether they currently use transport on TW, will have  to have a firm transportation agreement when they buy an option.  In other  words, a shipper that does not currently have a service agreement will simply  execute an agreement with a MAXDTQ of zero.  This structure has two  advantages:  1) it's consistent with our option-fee-as-part-of-transport-rate  theory, and 2) it will help support that theory in our next rate case.  I'd like to meet next week, either Wednesday afternoon or Thursday, to  discuss the following topics:  1)  Your comments and questions on this draft, 2)  Some examples of options, to make sure the tariff provisions and contract  work from a logistical standpoint, 3)  The bidding process, and how bids for options will be evaluated, and 4)  Comments received from shippers thus far.

I'm meeting informally with the Commercial Group next week to discuss 1) some  examples of options to make sure the tariff provisions and contract work from  a logistical standpoint, 2) the bidding process, and how bids for options  will be evaluated, and 3) further comments received from shippers.  I'll  circulate our ideas on bidding and awarding options, and any other new ideas  or questions.  As I've discussed with some of you, our shippers are asking to see the filing  in its entirety before we file it, and would like to have a roundtable  meeting prior to filing to discuss their concerns.  I realize there is some  concern about showing them our filing.  What if we just show them our final  tariff language and form agreement, and offer to host a meeting to discuss  their questions?  Let me know what you think.  Our target filing date will depend on whether we have a customer meeting  first, and when FERC staff is available to talk.

"Yesterday Jeff Fawcett, Lee Ferrell and I met with Dynegy marketing and  legal/regulatory representatives regarding TW Transport Options.  Overall the  meeting was very positive.  We had nothing but encouraging remarks from the  marketing representatives.  However, the regulatory people (Sarah Tomalty, Ed  Ross) had a couple of issues.  The biggest issue is a marketing affiliate  concern.  Apparently Dynegy is on a crusade at FERC to place further limits  on deals pipelines can do with their marketing affiliates.  They have run  into situations in which pipelines (examples:  Koch, El Paso) have blatantly  favored their marketing affiliates to the extent that Dynegy cannot even do  deals with them.  (In fact, one of the problems with Koch has been Koch's  price option deals with its affiliate.)  The perception is that the  affiliates, by using ""funny money,"" can always make themselves the highest  bidder, with a net benefit to the entire organization (pipeline +  affiliate).  The remedy Dynegy is proposing is to require a marketing  affiliate, if it is the highest bidder, to credit back the difference between  the price it pays and the price offered by the next highest bidder.  The  presumption is that the affiliate has an unfair advantage because it is able  to pay above market value in order to get the capacity.   Dynegy's proposal  would encourage affiliates to pay ""real"" dollars.    While it emphasized its belief that TW does not favor its marketing  affiliates, Dynegy would like for us to include in our filing some limitation  on options transactions with marketing affiliates.   It is likely that other  pipelines will file for the ability to sell options once FERC approves our  filing, and Dynegy would like for this type of protection to be part of the  precedent set by our filing.  Ed hinted that FERC may be considering a  divestiture requirement for marketing affiliates, and that pipelines can  avoid this extreme result by voluntarily limiting their transactions with  affiliates.  Shelley, I know you've discussed this issue with Ed already and  our reactions were the same.  Basically we politely told Dynegy that we don't  believe we're part of the problem and that we are therefore not inclined to  unnecessarily disadvantage our company by further limiting ENA's ability to  do business with TW.   We can probably expect an intervention with comments  or a limited protest addressing the issue.  The other regulatory question was whether we intend to file each option deal  as a negotiated rate.  My analysis of this issue is that since we're  proposing the option fee as part of the transport rate, options would always  be a type of negotiated rate and would need to be filed.  If you think this  is not the right answer, please let me know because we need to decide it  before we file the tariff sheets.  Sarah's question seemed to be more one of  curiosity rather than a basis for protest.  Like the Indicated Shippers, Dynegy appeared interested in an all-customer  meeting to discuss the service.  Jeff and the rest of the commercial group  are looking further into whether and when we would have such a meeting.   If you have any questions or concerns please let me know.","mary.miller@enron.com, shelley.corman@enron.com, glen.hass@enron.com,   sstojic@gbmdc.com, steven.harris@enron.com",susan.scott@enron.com,TW Options Update: Dynegy meeting,2000-08-17 04:27:00-07:00,sent

"I've looked into whether we can terminate our Val Verde interconnect  agreement with Burlington, and have determined we may do so only if we take  the following steps:  1.  Terminate the OBA by giving 30 days notice to Burlington.  Paragraph 13  of the 6/1/94 OBA with Burlington (as successor in interest to Meridian)  provides that either party may terminate the OBA ""at the end of the primary  term, or thereafter by providing thirty (30) days prior written notice"" to  Burlington.  (The one-month primary term ended June 30, 1994 and has since  gone month-to-month.)  2.  On the effective termination date of the OBA, terminate the interconnect  agreement by giving 30 days notice to Burlington.    The 12/31/92  Interconnect Point Operating Agreement, Paragraph 6, provides that either  party may terminate on 180 prior notice after expiration of the primary  term.  This is of limited use to us since the primary term does not expire  until 12/31/02.  However, the paragraph also provides that the agreement ""may  be terminated by either party upon thirty (30) days prior written notice in  the event the OBA between the parties is terminated.""

"First of all, I'm delighted you want to stay and would not have a problem  with Deron moving in.  However, in return I would ask for increased rent of  $650, to take into account the improvements you want and additional water use  and wear & tear.  After you read this let me know whether you think this is  reasonable.  I'll try to answer all your questions:  Q. I believe you had mentioned some termite issues and I wanted to make sure that we would not be doing anything to cause the floor to collapse  as we would be removing light items for heavier items.   A.  I really do not think it is a problem.  In addition to the oak floor,  there is a subfloor, so heavier items should be fine.  I'd draw the line at a  waterbed, though!  Q.  The stove is a bit problematic...   A.  No problem to look into this.  I'm sure it can be repaired.  I will give  the appliance folks a call.    Q.  Do you know if the garage apt. would support a 2nd line being installed?   A.  I'm sure it will...go ahead and do it; if the phone company runs into any  internal wiring problems let me know and I'll call my phone wiring dude.  Q.  Do you know if the washer/dryer connections in the garage part work for  sure?  A.  I have a bad feeling about those connections!  I'll get them up and  running, and can get someone to haul the old washer off.  Q.  I am guessing that they would need to be gas, not electric?   A.  I would strongly recommend a gas dryer because it is so much more  economical.  Plus you would not believe how much faster you can get jeans and  towels dry than with electric! If I have to get a new connection installed it will be gas if possible.  Q.  At one point, you had mentioned doing something with the kitchen floor as  the linoleum has seen better days... Would it be possible to look into this?  A.  I have always thought linoleum in a black & white checkerboard pattern  would look really cute in there.  It's cheap to install and fairly easy  except I'm leary of taking on the project myself because pulling up the old  stuff is going to be a you-know-what.  I will call & ask my handyman, unless  you and Deron are just dying to do it yourselves.  Q.  Do you know if any paint is leftover?  A.  The color I used on the trim was Antique White semigloss; there should be  some left in the garage.  I'll check and if not I can pick up some for you at  the paint store as I'll be going there this week or this weekend.  The only additional issue I have is parking -- Dianna is staying with me and  helping w/rent for the next several months and I'd like her to be able to use  that middle space.  I know it's a pain but either you or Deron would have to  park on the street.  The other option is to get one of the back garage doors  working so there is access to the garage from the alley.  If I did this do  you think y'all would use it, or is that too impractical?  As for timing with the oven, W/D connections and kitchen floor, I'm taking  the first full week of Sept. off and it would be easiest for me to get  everything done then if that's okay with y'all.

"I agree that the proposed facilities could be constructed under the prior  notice provisions of TW's blanket certificate if the cost and environmental  requirements are met.  The facilities appear to meet the criteria for an  ""eligible facility"" under section 157.202(b)(2)(i):  they are necessary to  provide service to Big Sandy within existing mainline certificate levels, and  according to my research the facilities are similar to those that the  Commission routinely has found to be eligible under a blanket certificate.   The prior notice project cost limit for year 2000 is $20,200,000.  (Sec.  157.208).  If the project is not within this cost limit we will need to seek  a 7(c) certificate.    I've researched the incremental rate question and here's what I've been able  to find out:  In the context of a 7(c) application, FERC generally requires use of existing  Part 284 rates.  This was the case when TW applied for a certificate to  construct the San Juan lateral.  TW requested a separate zone rate for the  lateral in that proceeding but FERC stated that a section 7 proceeding was  not the appropriate forum.  The Commission stated, however, that it would be  willing to entertain an abbreviated Section 4 filing by TW to revise its Part  284 rates to inclue zone rates for the lateral.  So TW made a Section 4  filing and got zone rates approved based on the cost of service for the  lateral.   Whether we construct the Big Sandy lateral under the blanket certificate or  not, it appears that we would have to file a limited section 4 if we want to  implement rates for the lateral that are different from the West of Thoreau  rates.  As for whether an open season would be required, I assume it would not be if  Caithness is going to fully subscribe the capacity on the lateral.  However,  if other shippers are interested and we want to get the best rate we'll  probably want to have an open season.  In any event, in the context of a 7(c)  application FERC is going to put us at risk for recovery of costs, so it  would be to our advantage to sell 100% of the new capacity.  At this point I am uncertain whether we even want or need different rates for  the Big Sandy lateral...ultimately it will depend on the cost of the project  and what rates would make it economic for TW to proceed.  I hope this helps...if there are further questions or if any of this does not  sound right to you let me know.

Project    As you are aware, Transwestern is working with a shipper to potentially  provide service to a new power plant located approximately 40 miles off the  mainline in Arizona.  Although, the final negotiation are not complete  certain options are being evaluated, I need some assistance in interpreting  the regulations regarding the authority we should use for approval of this  project.    The facilities that would be constructed include a delivery point and  approximately 40 miles of pipe.  As these facilities are non-mainline, it may  be possible to construct the proposed facilities under the prior notice  provisions of TW's blanket certificate, provided the project satisfies the  blanket criteria (generally costs and environmental).  With this in mind, I have the following issues and questions:  Preliminarily, marketing is thinking that we may want to develop an  incremental rate  to recover the cost of the project.  Would a new incremental rate for this service impact our ability to file for  approval under the prior notice provisions?  Note: Generally, Subpart F of  Part 157 (blanket regulations) does not address service issues as  transportation service is provided under Part 284 of the Commission's  regulations.  However, the regulations (o157.204)  set forth Who may apply  for a blanket certificate.   The criteria includes, among other things, any  interstate pipeline that has rates accepted by the Commission.  Therefore,  would an incremental rate have to be approved by the Commission before the  proposed facilities would be blanket eligible?  Can a new incremental rate be established through a limit-section 4 rate  filing or is a case-specific certificate required?  As the facilities will not include any mainline expansion - Is an open season  required for the project?  My opinion is ""NO"".  Do you agree?  Your thoughts and assistance in this matter would be greatly appreciated.   Thanks MW  ",michele.winckowski@enron.com,susan.scott@enron.com,"Re: Caithness Big Sandy, LLC.

Although, the final negotiation are not complete  certain options are being evaluated, I need some assistance in interpreting  the regulations regarding the authority we should use for approval of this  project.    The facilities that would be constructed include a delivery point and  approximately 40 miles of pipe.  As these facilities are non-mainline, it may  be possible to construct the proposed facilities under the prior notice  provisions of TW's blanket certificate, provided the project satisfies the  blanket criteria (generally costs and environmental).  With this in mind, I have the following issues and questions:  Preliminarily, marketing is thinking that we may want to develop an  incremental rate  to recover the cost of the project.  Would a new incremental rate for this service impact our ability to file for  approval under the prior notice provisions?  Note: Generally, Subpart F of  Part 157 (blanket regulations) does not address service issues as  transportation service is provided under Part 284 of the Commission's  regulations.  However, the regulations (o157.204)  set forth Who may apply  for a blanket certificate.   The criteria includes, among other things, any  interstate pipeline that has rates accepted by the Commission.  Therefore,  would an incremental rate have to be approved by the Commission before the  proposed facilities would be blanket eligible?  Can a new incremental rate be established through a limit-section 4 rate  filing or is a case-specific certificate required?  As the facilities will not include any mainline expansion - Is an open season  required for the project?  My opinion is ""NO"".  Do you agree?  Your thoughts and assistance in this matter would be greatly appreciated.   Thanks MW    ",drew.fossum@enron.com,susan.scott@enron.com,"Re: Caithness Big Sandy, LLC.

"Cinderella in Her Later Years.......  Cinderella was now 75 years old. After a fulfilling life with the now dead Prince, she happily sat upon her rocking chair, watching the world go by from her front porch, with a cat named Bob for companionship.  One sunny afternoon, out of nowhere, appeared the Fairy Godmother.  Cinderella said ""Fairy Godmother, what are you doing here after all these years??""  The Fairy godmother replied ""Well Cinderella, since you have lived a good, wholesome life since we last met, I have decided to grant you 3 wishes.  Is there anything for which your heart still yearns?""  Cinderella was taken aback, overjoyed and after some thoughtful consideration, and almost under her breath she uttered her first wish:  ""I wish I was wealthy beyond comprehension."" Instantly, her rocking chair was turned into solid gold. Cinderella was stunned.  Bob, her old faithful cat, jumped off her lap and scampered to the edge of the porch, quivering with fear. Cinderella said ""Oh thank you, Fairy Godmother"".  The Fairy Godmother replied, ""It is the least I can do. What does your heart want for your second wish?"" Cinderella looked down at her frail body, and said: ""I wish I was young and full of the beauty of youth again.""  At once, her wish having been desired became reality, and her beautiful youthful visage had returned. Cinderella felt stirrings inside her that had been dormant for years and a long forgotten vigor and vitality began to course through her.  Then the Fairy Godmother again spoke ""You have one more wish, what shall you have?"" Cinderella looks over to the frightened cat in the corner and says""; ""I wish for you to transform Bob, my old cat, into a beautiful, and handsome young man"".  Magically, Bob suddenly underwent so fundamental a change in his biological make-up, that when complete he stood before her, a man, so beautiful the like of which she nor the world had ever seen, so fair indeed that birds began to fall from the sky at his feet.  The Fairy Godmother again spoke: ""Congratulations, Cinderella.  Enjoy your new life."" And, with a blazing shock of bright blue electricity, she was gone. For a few eerie moments, Bob and Cinderella looked into each other's eyes, Cinderella sat, breathless, gazing at the most stunningly perfect man she had ever seen. Then Bob walked over to Cinderella, who sat transfixed in her rocking chair, and held her close in his young muscular arms.  He leaned in close blowing her golden hair with his warm breath as he whispered:  ""I bet you regret having me neutered now, don't you?""

In the deal, Enron will provide both gas and electric commodities to Hades' facilities throughout and under North America.  John D. Rockefeller, former CEO of energy monopolist Standard Oil, is now head of Hades' energy management division.  Said Rockefeller, ""Obviously Hell has significant heating demands.  While eternal flames are a great idea in concept, they require vast and reliable fuel resources.  Enron was the only supplier willing to make a deal with my boss, and, as a former monopolist, I just like the way they do business."" A spokesperson for Enron said the two cultures were able to work easily together during negotiations.  According to the company, ""The deal fits both companies exceptionally well.  With Hades' ability to attract and retain new customers, we see this as a fabulous growth opportunity for millennia to come.""  According to several energy industry insiders, Hades' high heating demand with very little need for summer air conditioning make it a very attractive energy portfolio addition. Hades is a multinational corporation with millions of sites worldwide and approximately 173 quintillion customers.  The entity boasts sustained high growth rates over the last two thousand years. Enron is one of the world's leading energy and communications companies. The company owns approximately $37 billion in energy and communications assets.

HI Susan-  I'm so excited for your visit this weekend!  Whenever you get a chance, let me know your arrival time on Saturday and departure on Monday so I can plan around them both....  I've been brainstorming some fun things for us to do, and thought we could spend some time lounging at the beach, shopping at the outlet center near me, go out for a champagne bunch on Sunday, grill out on the beach, and possibly go to a polo match or the Del Mar races.  Which of these interests you?  Are there any tourist sites that you would like to see while in town?  The zoo, Balboa Park (where all the museums are), or anything else?  Oh- I've arranged for us to have a massage on Monday- the woman is coming to my house!  We'll each get a 30 minute massage....I think this will be great quality, girl time!  I've missed our shopping binges!  Please bring any current pictures of friends and family- I can't wait to hear how everyone in your life is doing.  Weather has been beautiful as usual- about 75 degrees and perfect.  In the evenings it gets cool enough to wear you need a light sweater or jacket, but you can always borrow something from me, too.  The condo I'm living in now is tiny, but cute.  I've been living there for a year and am moving out in 2 weeks.  I could have moved out this Labor Day weekend, but obviously didn't want to be doing that while you were in town.  So you'll have to excuse a bit of the mess and come back another time when I move into the cuter place- I love the new place I'm moving into- it's 2 stories with vaulted ceilings and lots of skylights.  See you soon! Julie  ",ted.noble@enron.com,susan.scott@enron.com,this weekend!,2000-08-28 10:37:00-07:00,sent
"Julie,  Everything you have mentioned up to this point sounds incredible.  I would  love to see the symphony, got to a polo match or the races, etc. etc.  I've  made everybody here at work green with envy talking about my trip.  I'm going  to email you back tomorrow with a much more detailed response to your emails  because I'm trying like mad to get out of work before 7:00 tonight.  Anyway,  like I said it all sounds great and I am very excited about the trip (believe  me it's much needed).

"Julie,  Sorry for the delayed response.  I can't express to you how excited I am to  be coming out there this weekend.  After the last week and a half of work I  am in desperate need of rest and relaxation (that of course means lots of  shopping).  As far as activities go, I'm pretty much up for anything.  My  guess is I'm probably going to want to take a quick nap when I get in  Saturday morning before starting the weekend's activities, but after that I  say we just get going.  The symphony sounds incredible as do the races or the  polo match so I'll just leave the final choices to your discretion.  I would  definitely be up for a trip to the zoo if you want to go, but considering I  go there every time I'm in San Diego I could miss it in order to do/see some  other things.  The only things I insist upon are ample time outdoors and good  seafood.  Anyway,  I arrive in San Diego on America West flight 2180 at about  9:00 a.m. and leave Monday at 6:10 p.m. so we've almost got three full days  to work with.

So, being a guy, I take the alarm completely out of the wall with  my leatherman tool.  Finally go to sleep and arrive in my same clothes and  baseball hat at work around 7:30 to pick up my keys and head home and  shower/change.  Of course this cannot go perfectly, so I run into my MD on  the way to the Met parking lot. Smooth.  I finally arrive back at work around  9:00 and miss the group's morning weather briefing.

"Jeff -- since most of Teddy's comments were over my head yesterday, I could  use your help on that part of the discussion.  *** Transwestern held its Transport Options Workshop on August 31.   Commercial  and regulatory representatives of BP-Amoco, Burlington, Conoco, Coral,  Dynegy, Phillips and Reliant attended.  After a brief overview of the  proposed TW Options filing, we opened the floor for questions and comments.   Here is a summary of the comments.  Marketing affiliate concerns.  BP's regulatory representative expressed  concern that TW's marketing affiliates would be able to use options to game  the system.  For example, since TW and ENA are both Enron companies, if ENA  buys a call option it is essentially a free option.  ENA could buy a call out  of the money and we could buy it back from them, with the proceeds going to  Enron's bottom line.  BP suggested that TW's marketing affiliates be banned  from purchasing options, or that the marketing affiliate be required to  credit the call money to other shippers.  BP's concern is that TW's filing  will set a precedent for other pipelines to offer a similar service, so they  want TW's options program to be as restricted as possible.  Dynegy reiterated  its suggestion that the marketing affiliate be required to credit back the  difference between the option fee paid by the affiliate and the next highest  bidder's bid, if the affiliate's bid exceeds the next highest bid by a  certain percentage.    Our response was that while actual abuse of an options program by a marketing  affiliate would be a concern, we feel that TW is entitled to a presumption  that it has complied and will continue to comply with the rules on sale of  capacity to marketing affiliates.  At this point we are not inclined to  voluntarily include any limitations on the options program.  If BP and others  have issues regarding Commission marketing affiliate policy in general, those  issues should be addressed in a different proceeding that pertain to all  interstate pipelines.  Right of first refusal.  Burlington asked whether options would replace the  right of first refusal.  Our response was that ROFR will still be available  pursuant to the terms and conditions of our tariff.  Negotiated rate.  BP's representative claimed that options will constitute a  negotiated rate and that each deal will need to be filed as such.  We did not  respond to this or discuss it further.  However, TW's position at this point  is that since the option fee is part of the transportation rate, the deals  will only be negotiated rate deals if the total rate exceeds the maximum  rate.    Hoarding capacity.  Several customers expressed concern that the options  program would make it easier for a shipper to hoard capacity.  It was not  clear why they thought that options would create more opportunity for  hoarding than already exists.  Their perception was that options would simply  make hoarding cheaper and easier.  We acknowledged that the potential for  withholding capacity from the market is one reason for FERC's current policy  against reserving capacity for shippers.  Although we did not commit to  placing any limits on the quantity of capacity for which a shipper may  purchase an option, it is possible that FERC may require us to do so.  Our plan is to meet with PG&E and SoCalGas in California to elicit their  comments, and finalize the FERC filing by mid-September.

"Transwestern held its Transport Options Workshop on August 31.   Commercial  and regulatory representatives of BP-Amoco, Burlington, Conoco, Coral,  Dynegy, Phillips and Reliant attended.  After a brief overview of the  proposed filing, TW opened the floor for questions and comments.  Here is a  summary of the comments.  Marketing affiliate concerns.  BP's regulatory representative expressed  concern that TW's marketing affiliates would be able to use options to game  the system.  In BP's example, since TW and ENA are both Enron companies, ENA  could purchase an ""out of the money"" call option essentially cost free, since  its affiliate (TW) would have the ability to buy the option back.  Proceeds  from ENA's ability to then ""move the market"" through the establishment of the  long basis position would go directly to Enron's bottom line.  BP suggested  that TW's marketing affiliates be banned from purchasing options, or that the  marketing affiliate be required to credit 100% of the option proceeds to  other shippers.  Although BP admits that Transwestern's prior dealings with  ENA have not been suspect, BP fears that TW's filing will set a precedent for  other pipelines to offer a similar service.  Since TW will be the first  pipeline to offer such services, BP wants TW's program to be as restricted as  possible.  Dynegy echoed BP's concern regarding possible affiliate abuse, but  rather than shelve the program entirely, Dynegy reiterated an earlier  suggestion that Transwestern be required to credit back the difference  between the option fee paid by an affiliate and the next highest bidder, if  the affiliate's bid exceeds the next highest by a certain percentage.    TW's response was that while actual abuse of an options program by a  marketing affiliate may be a legitimate concern, owing to its unassailable  record in this area, TW should be entitled to a presumption that it has  complied and will continue to comply with Commission policy covering the sale  of capacity to marketing affiliates, and was not inclined to voluntarily  include any limitations on the options program.  If BP and others have  serious concerns regarding the Commission's overall policy on marketing  affiliates, those issues should be raised in a separate proceeding that  applies to all interstate pipelines.  Right of first refusal.  Burlington asked whether options would replace the  right of first refusal.  TW's  response was that ROFR will still be available  pursuant to the terms and conditions of our tariff.  Negotiated rate.  BP's representative claimed that option contracts will  constitute a negotiated rate and that each deal will need to be filed as  such.  TW did not respond to this or discuss it further.  However, TW's  position at this point is that since the option fee is part of the  transportation rate, transportation deals that include the option amendment  will only be considered negotiated rate deals if the total rate including the  option fee exceeds the maximum transport rate.    Hoarding capacity.  Using the recent large block sale of capacity on El Paso  as an example, several customers expressed concern that the options program  would make it easier for a shipper to hoard capacity.  It was not clear why  some of the workshop participants thought that the sale of options would  create more opportunity for hoarding capacity than already exists.  Perhaps  because the option fee is a lesser cost than the transport rate for the  underlying capacity, their perception was that options would simply make  hoarding cheaper and easier.  TW acknowledged that the potential for  withholding capacity from the market is one reason for FERC's current policy  against reserving capacity for shippers.  Although TW did not commit to  placing any limits on the either the quantity of capacity or options for  capacity that any one shipper may own, it is possible that FERC may require  TW to do so in a final order.  Our plan is to meet with PG&E and SoCalGas in California the week of  September 11 to go over details of the program, and to finalize the FERC  filing by mid-September.

Here in Canada, we do not to deals at NGI-PGE/CG and I do not believe that  the book PWR-NG-LTCA is a Canadian book.  A review of the audit trial indicates that the counterparty used to be  EPMI.  Is it possible it was changed by mistake to ECC.

"Hey Em,  First things first, I got the personality test...very interesting.  I took it  twice.  The first time I was a Mastermind (like Katy) and the second I was a  Mentor (like Matt)  I think I only changed two answers between the first and  second test.  Anyway, definitely a fun little intro to a rather boring Monday  morning.  I was trying to remember where we left on in the saga of Ted Noble.  I guess  the last time I had emailed you Ted had to spend the night at Darren's  apartment because he'd left his keys in his locker at the Met.  Well, if  you'll remember at the end of the email he said he'd talk to me later, which  is extremely relevant considering he was supposed to tell me whether we could  go get a drink that night or not.  I knew he had his presentation that day so  I figured he'd call later that afternoon to tell me yeah or neah...I received  no call, no email, no nothing.  Of course, always wanting to give others the  benefit of the doubt I figured the presentation must have taken longer than  expected and afterward he'd decided to just go to Austin and pick up his  friend from the airport.  If that were the case, knowing Ted, I thought he  must have just forgotten that he'd told me he'd call.  WRONG!!!!  Friday at  work I had to go down to his floor (for legitimate reasons I swear) and he  was there, the jerk.  He didn't see me though nor did he try communicate with  me at all that day.    Flash forward to the next week.  I didn't get back to the office until  Wednesday because I was in Austin Tuesday for a recruiting trip.  When I got  in I of course immediately checked my email...nothing.  I also didn't have  any messages at any of the 3 phones I can be reached through.  So it's now  Thursday afternoon, still no interaction...I am pissed.  About 2:00 p.m. he  calls.  He asks me about San Diego and I ask him about Austin...both trips  were great.  We discuss UCLA and UT football for  a while...I of course get  riled up.  He informs me that he is going to be trading corn (yes, you heard  me corn) for Enron.  While he is very excited about trading I get the  impression he feels a little overwhelmed and he is a very concerned about how  much trading will limit his vacation time.  He said that he and Darren had  been meeting with consultants all week to get up to speed and therefore the  week had pretty much just been one long string of meetings.  It is around  this point that he brings up the vacation thing and how, to his dismay, as a  trader you work when the markets are open and you're only off when they're  closed.  As a result, he's decided to get in his long visit home ASAP, i.e.  ""I'm leaving tomorrow (Friday) to go to California for a week.""  I make sure  I heard him correctly and yes he said leaving, tomorrow and  1 whole week (7  days) AND at no point did he ask to get together before he left.  So, that  was Thursday.  I'm down on his floor again on Friday to talk to my old group  and, to my dismay, run in to him.  We exchange pleasantries, I ask him when  he's leaving, he informs me he is going to sleep for the entire week in an  attempt to catch-up, I tell him to have fun and that's that.  So here we are, or rather here I am in Houston...alone.  Any thoughts?  On a brighter note, tell Katy I think I'm going to try and come Oct 4 - Oct 9  so that I can see both of you.  Also, I understand your dilemma regarding  Claudia, but I definitely don't think you should look a gift horse in the  mouth (if you know what I mean).  That first month after Katy leaves is going  to be awkward so it's best to have someone there even if only to act as a  crutch until you find your footing.  I'm sure Monique can testify to a little  extra weight dealing with me since you and Matt both took off.  And speaking  of Matt, no I haven't heard a thing from the turn-coat.  I need to shoot him  an email and see how things are shaping up for him.  I'm willing to bet  though that moving to Austin hasn't solved all of his problems...just  transplanted to a prettier location.  Get back to me with anything...I'm desperate for positive energy.  Oh, and  I'm going to try to meet with that Director friend of mine this week to talk  about swinging a rotation in London (he has 75 employees over there that work  for him right now), and I'm going to set up a meeting with the lady in charge  of my rotations within the analyst program to make sure I'm doing everything  I can to get over there and still get promoted.

"Christine, the ""actual fuel usage"" provision is probably a material deviation  from the tariff, unless we cap the fuel rate at the maximum percentage stated  in our tariff.  I have added language to this effect.  If we're using the ""actual fuel"" language because we anticipate that the fuel  usage will exceed the maximum, and therefore we do not wish to cap the  percentage at the maximum, we can certainly leave my additional language out  and file a summary of the contract.  I do not think such a filing would  generate too much unwanted attention from FERC or our shippers.  Let me know.

Also, Kevin - is $.09 a  sufficient TOTAL RATE for alternate deliveries to the California Border?  I  think by fixing the rate like this we are leaving a lot of money behind.  We  could put wording in the contact that each month the alternate rate to  California will be set by Transwestern.  We have, a long time ago, used this  language and it forces the shipper to call TK for the appropriate montly rate  quote.  If fact, Richardson Products has this arrangement.

"Elizabeth, Jeff forwarded me your questions about capacity options.  I've  answered them to the extent they involve legal/regulatory issues.  If you  need anything further please don't hesitate to call.  ?  Can a new shipper who enters into an FTS-1 contract with zero MDQ in order  to purchase a shipper call option or sell a transporter put option be  allowed, prior to the exercise date, to transfer the underlying option rights  by permanently releasing this contract?    YES.  ?   Will we be required to report these contracts with zero MDQ on the Index  of Customers and/or the Transactional Report?  YES.  ? Can the releasing shipper permanently release a portion of his existing MDQ  and choose to keep or transfer the option rights?   YES.  The shipper could  even release all of its MDQ (reducing it to zero) and keep its option rights.  ? How is it determined whether a contract with an option amendment is within  the min/max tariff rate or needs to be filed as a negotiated rate?  The  option fee is converted to a per-Dth, per day rate and added to the transport  rate.  If the total exceeds the maximum tariff rate, it's ""negotiated"".   Otherwise, our position is that it's not negotiated.

"I've discussed the ""actual fuel"" provision with Christine and Bob and made  them aware that this is a nonconforming provision that would need to be  filed, since the FTS-1 rate schedule provides that fuel payments are to be  made according to the percentages set forth in the rate sheets.    According to Bob's calculations, the actual fuel used by Duke under this  contract is likely to exceed the applicable percentages in our tariff.  I don't think FERC or any of our shippers would have any immediate objection  to our charging actual fuel.  However, I know that fuel is a sensitive issue  on TW so I wanted to be sure to draw your attention to this provision.

For NNG, no tariff sheets need to be changed at this time.  The tariff  currently states that NNG does not share marketing employees with its  marketing affiliates.  The tariff also states that the only shared facility  is the Houston office.  Both of these items are still true.  The EES employee  on 2 in this building is not considered an employee of an NNG marketing  affiliate.  As far as compliance with the posting requirements on the  internet, all affiliate information, job descriptions, organization charts,  and corporate structure are available.  I talked with Toby today about an  indicator when the information is updated.  The web site currently does not  have a specific date as to when the information was last updated.  The  organization charts have a date in the left hand corner to indicate the date  the chart was put together which would change as the chart information  changed.  Dari, to be in compliance with Standard L, does Toby need to add an  indicator showing when the information was last updated?  Also, it is my  understanding that Dari will put together the filing letter.  For TW, tariff sheets will need to change to reflect that they are sharing  office space with their affiliate in Albuquerque and in this office building  with the EES employee on 2.  The posted information for TW would be the same  as for NNG so the question still exists as to whether Toby would need to add  an indicator of when the information was last updated.  Would Mary be  preparing the tariff sheets and Maria preparing the letter?  In a copy of a Tennessee filing that Maria gave me, Tennessee proposed taking  the marketing affiliate information out of the tariff completely because it  wasn't possible to meet the ""update within 3 days"" requirement stated in  Standard L through changing tariff sheets.  Instead, Tennessee will have this  information on their website.  The order accepting their filing came out  August 23rd.  Is this of interest to anyone?  Please let me know if I have left out anything.  Thanks. Ranelle ",susan.scott@enron.com,glen.hass@enron.com,marketing affiliate filing,2000-09-12 08:32:00-07:00,received

Sorry I didn't respond to your email yesterday.  I opened it in between classes, but never got back to my comouter and was out eating with a firm until 11:00.  I will be glad when all of this is over.  The jury is split on what you should do.  Knowing myself, I would want to know what happened...  i.e. what's the matter with him?  I think I would ask him-- in a non-confrontational-- almost joking way-- like I didn't really care either way but was just wondering-- why he stopped calling, etc.  I say that, but I have never done that before, so I don't really know if that is what I wish I would do, or if that really is what I would do-- and this has happened to me lots of times.  Usually, I just write the guy off as gay or stupid...  Leslie (and though I haven't talked to my mom, I know she would agree) says not to give him any satisfaction of knowing you care.  Just act pleasant and normal as if nothing has happened and is if you were actually the one who stopped the contact-- maybe he thinks you were, you never know.  I think this is a good tactic if you are sure your curiosity and need to tell him off won't eat at you.  Actually, in practice, I usually combine these tactics.  Remember when Michael Stockton was so rude to me freshman year?  First I called him and told him off (Laura made me), then I ignored him (pleasantly, though)for about four months until he couldn't stand it and started asking Laura about me.  In other words, both tactics are good.  I really think you ought to do what makes you feel the best.  If you confront him, he might say something you don't want to hear, but then again, you will get some resolution.  If you don't confront him, you can always chalk it up to his homosexuality and you can feel better knowing he thinks you don't care...  If I ever see him again, I will ignore him (blatantly).  Don't worry about it too much-- we should feel sorry for people who are still confused about their sexuality at 31.  Isn't he a little old to be living in the closet?  Let me know what happens.  -Corey   _________________________________________________________________________ Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.

There = is=20 also no respect for our running game from any team that we face. I think th= e=20 best way to end this strategy against us is to become the aggressor on=20 offense and not sit back passively and react to what the defense is giving= =20 us. =20 =09 =09In order for us to achieve this, I think it starts with us putting our b= est=20 athletes on the field on offense. These guys may not be the most experience= d=20 players, but they will gain experience with playing time, and they have the= =20 ability to make a team pay for selling out with the blitz. It's time to sta= rt=20 Roy Williams and B.J. Johnson at receiver (along with Montrell Flowers) and= =20 play a one-back offensive set.

He just hasn't had the chanc= e=20 to display them. We desperately need to have all playmakers on the field if= =20 we are going to turn this thing around. If not, I could see this season=20 slipping to 7-4 real quick. What are your thoughts, Chip?=20 =09 ?? The Jackson residence=20 =09 =09 BROWN:  With any unexpected loss, the tendency is to throw everyone out=  -=20 change coaches, players, even the bus driver. You do that and you are telli= ng=20 this team that you have absolutely no confidence in them. There can't be to= o=20 much change at any one time. The big question is how the team responds to= =20 this Stanford loss emotionally. Something tells me if Texas can find some= =20 resolve and perform really well, you'll see some solid performances at all= =20 the positions where problems currently exist. In 1996, Texas was No. 6 and= =20 Notre Dame was No. 9. Texas had the game won in Austin and then lost. UT th= en=20 lost three of its next four, which included games against Oklahoma State,= =20 Oklahoma and Colorado - all teams Texas is about to face after this week's= =20 opponent, Houston.=20 =09 =09That was a different coach and different players. But the common thread = was=20 that Texas hit the top 10 and then choked. If Texas is hung over from its= =20 loss to Stanford, trouble could be on the horizon. If Texas can find resolv= e=20 to show everyone that Stanford truly was a game in which everything that=20 could go wrong did, then I think the Longhorns will bounce back and be a ha= rd=20 team to beat the rest of the way. Tuesday night Mack Brown said the Longhor= ns=20 are not a very good football team right now. The challenge has been made to= =20 his team. If they come out and stink against Houston, every position will b= e=20 scrutinized, every coach, even the bus driver. There will be enough fire=20 being thrown in Austin to serve up grilled fajitas for the entire state.

Mitch Golding=20 =09 =09 BROWN:  As the QBs turn. This week, it appears Chris Simms will start= =20 because he was practicing with the first team on Tuesday. That has been the= =20 trend. Whoever practices with the first team gets the start. Anyway, we'll= =20 see how they respond after the Stanford game. Major Applewhite was erratic = in=20 his play, despite almost leading the Longhorns back from the dead to a=20 miraculous victory. I'm sticking to my theory that the coaches want to see= =20 what Simms can do against Houston before picking one or the other =20 =09 =09to get solo duty in the Oklahoma and Colorado games. =20 =09 =09Granted, if one struggles along the way, the other will come in. But Mac= k=20 Brown said they primarily went with Applewhite against Stanford because of= =20 his experience and the fact that it was the team's first game on the road. = He=20 said they still have all the faith in the world in Simms. It would seem to = me=20 that it takes away the incentive to really take control of the offense, lig= ht=20 it up and get on a roll when you are alternating, but I'll continue to watc= h=20 like everyone else. =20 =09 =09I keep trying to remind myself that Brown did this twice at North Caroli= na=20 with success. Of course, with those QBs (Oscar Davenport and Chris Keldorf)= ,=20 Brown had different styles and gained an advantage by forcing the defense t= o=20 prepare for Davenport's scrambling and Keldorf's passing. With Simms and=20 Applewhite you pretty much get the same style.

Nels Marshall=20 =09 =09 BROWN:  Here are Brown's exact words: ""Experience. We were in a tight= =20 football game and Major (Applewhite) has been around a long time. I was pro= ud=20 - even with as poorly as we played offensively in the third quarter - that = we=20 didn't panic.

And even if he does get holes, he still will never break through t= he=20 linebackers for a TD. Why not put Ivan Williams or Kenny Hayter back there= =20 with Mitchell and go with a two-back, three-wide offense? You don't lose a= =20 receiver as Hodges is a nice, smart receiver. =09 =09Other ramblings: Is Quentin Jammer really a corner? He got beat MANY tim= e=20 against Stanford. I loved his hitting when he played safety but his injury= =20 may have forever changed his game if he can't play safety and can't keep up= =20 with opponent's wideouts. =09 =09How is the defensive end position shaping up? The defensive tackles were=  all=20 over the field against Stanford, but the DEs didn't make much noise. What i= s=20 up with the blocked punts? UT should be really, really embarrassed. Does=20 Stockton take too long? Is he too close to the line? Can the line block? Ca= n=20 anyone at UT block? =09 =09Does Brown ride the officials who are missing holding calls? Several tim= es=20 the camera caught clear holds by Stanford's line. Why on earth would you ru= n=20 up the middle, on your own goal line against two of the best DTs you'll pla= y=20 against?=20 =09?? Andrew Bowen=20 =09 =09 BROWN:  I think your feelings are shared by many Texas fans who are=20 incredibly pained, shocked, disappointed, angered and hurt by last Saturday= 's=20 events. But in talking to Mack Brown on Tuesday, he said it's fair to beat= =20 the team up for not being able to run the ball. But he said to jump on any= =20 other part of the team is to rip young, inexperienced kids who are still=20 learning what it takes to compete as a top-ranked team.=20 =09 =09To be fair to Brown, he did say repeatedly that his team was overrated a= nd=20 needed time to grow into some key positions - receiver, defensive end,=20 fullback and some positions on the offensive line and at corner. It probabl= y=20 isn't fair to question whether Mack Brown can motivate because his teams di= d=20 beat Nebraska twice, Oklahoma twice and Texas A=02?once. If a trend develop= s,=20 and Texas falls apart the rest of the season, there will be a fair question= =20 about whether Brown did a good enough job of keeping his team's head screwe= d=20 on straight. But it's typical after losses to want to shred every part of t= he=20 team.=20 =09 =09Brown said before the season that as soon as something went wrong, the= =20 quarterback situation would be blamed. And he was right. The QBs are still= =20 working hard, and look for Simms to start this week against Houston. There'= s=20 no question that the O-line is struggling, but so are the backs and so are= =20 the receivers. Brown said only two of the five sacks were the fault of the= =20 line. He said the other three were caused by miscommunication between=20 Applewhite and the receivers, causing Applewhite to hold the ball too long.= =20 =09 =09Mitchell was standing too deep in the backfield against Stanford, so it = was=20 taking him too long to get to the holes. The coaches were not happy about= =20 that. They were yelling at him to move up. He should only be 6 1/2 yards=20 deep. But he was sometimes at 9 yards. Mitchell also struggled with some=20 blitz pickup, which is uncharacteristic of him. So look for Victor Ike,=20 Hayter and possibly Williams to get a little time against Houston.=20 =09 =09Coaches are still high on Jammer. Again, he hasn't played corner much in= =20 games after moving from safety. But coaches are not thinking of moving him.= =20 The defensive end position is a big concern with defensive coordinator Carl= =20 Reese. He is willing to rifle through his whole pile until he finds a coupl= e=20 who can really play. Cory Redding was better than usual against Stanford. B= ut=20 that position still needs a lot of work. The blocked punt occurred because= =20 one player, who blocked perfectly on 11 other punts Saturday night, failed = to=20 block a player coming right up the middle, which guarantees doom. That play= er=20 has been chewed out every which way. =09 =09As far as the penalties, there were several questionable calls. But Brow= n,=20 who did a lot of yelling at officials during the Stanford game, couldn't sa= y=20 anything about it after the game because he would be fined. Texas can still= =20 have a good season, and perhaps having these problem areas pointed out so= =20 early will help in that direction. We'll see if Texas takes this loss=20 constructively or destructively.=20 =09? =09 =09 =09 Q: Last year at times I saw blazing speed and ability from Cory Redding= . I=20 know he was considered by many to be the best high school defensive player = in=20 the country in 1998. I've waited all off-season to see him explode against= =20 teams this year. I haven't seen it yet. Maybe this week against Stanford. M= y=20 question is, why was he moved from his high school position of linebacker= =20 where he was dominant into the defensive end role where he seems undersized= =20 and average? Is Texas that low on defensive line talent? It seems our=20 recruiting has been great. Please help me understand. Hook 'em Horns!=20 =09?? Ernie McAnally=20 =09 =09 BROWN:  Redding told me recently that linebacker is still his first lov= e.=20 But he said coaches came to him last year and said he could get on the fiel= d=20 right away as a defensive end. Coaches also feel that his body (6-5, 260) i= s=20 perfect for the DE position. He's tall, athletic, fast and has long arms. I= n=20 time, coaches feel Redding will develop into an All-America player. But the= re=20 is no question that he has struggled against the run. He made some big play= s=20 against Stanford, recording six tackles, three of them for losses and=20 blocking an extra point attempt. He is just a sophomore. Over this season a= nd=20 the next two years, he should only get better.=20 =09? =09 =09 Q: I was watching the regional telecast of the TCU game today and the= =20 announcers  stated that TCU had anted up $90,000 for the Heisman campaign f= or=20 LaDainian Tomlinson. How much did UT spend on its campaign for Ricky=20 Williams' run for the Heisman?=20 =09 =09 BROWN:  Texas didn't spend that much money at all. They produced a few= =20 postcards, a video and a CD-ROM screen saver to send out to the national=20 media detailing Ricky's accomplishments. But those costs totaled less than= =20 $10,000, according to UT officials.=20 =09? =09 =09 =09 Q: Did any of the freshman who did not play in the Louisiana-Lafayette = game=20 play in the Stanford game? I am watching to see which ones might be=20 redshirts. =20 =09?? Mike Smith, Houston=20 =09 =09 BROWN:  According to the participation chart provided at the Stanford-T= exas=20 game, Austin Sendlein was the only freshman to play against the Cardinal wh= o=20 did not play against Louisiana-Lafayette. In addition to Sendlein, here are= =20 the other freshmen who have played so far: WRs Roy Williams, B.J. Johnson a= nd=20 Sloan Thomas; TE Brock Edwards; DE Kalen Thornton; CB Nathan Vasher; FS=20 Phillip Geiggar; and DT Stevie Lee.=20 =09? =09 =09 =09 Q: Is it true that in Mack Brown's four or five head coaching stops, hi= s=20 teams have yet to win a single conference championship? Since UT has lost= =20 four out of its last five games, wouldn't a loss to Houston this week=20 officially end Mack Brown's honeymoon with the alumni, notwithstanding his= =20 abundant PR program? With Brown about to land his third national Top 5=20 recruiting class, I believe fans are going to expect more gridiron victorie= s=20 to go with those recruiting victories. =20 =09?? T. Hough=20 =09 =09 BROWN:  It's true that Brown has yet to win a conference championship i= n=20 stints at Appalachian State, Tulane, North Carolina and now Texas. At=20 Appalachian State, Tulane and UNC, he was taking over absolutely dead=20 programs. He took Tulane to a bowl, and he had Florida State to deal with i= n=20 the Atlantic Coast Conference while at UNC. But he took UNC to six bowl gam= es=20 in his 10 years at UNC and won four of them.=20 =09 =09A loss to Houston would certainly intensify the frustration of Texas=20 faithful. But I think anyone who would be looking to put Brown on the hot= =20 seat or rip him if Texas lost to Houston would be overlooking the job he ha= s=20 done beating Nebraska (twice), Oklahoma (twice) and Texas A=02?(once) in hi= s=20 first two seasons here. He has also turned Texas back into a destination=20 school for top recruits and brought the UT community back together. In=20 addition to all that, he has done more good for UT out of the limelight tha= n=20 probably most Texas fans realize.=20 =09 =09Brown is now in the same spotlight as Bobby Bowden, John Cooper, Lloyd C= arr,=20 Steve Spurrier and Phil Fulmer. Any unexpected losses are unforgivable in t= he=20 eyes of fans. It may take some time for Brown and his team to adjust to tha= t.=20 UNC fans were pretty ho-hum about everything the Tar Heels did in football,= =20 even when they won big. Brown wanted to win at a school with huge=20 expectations. He'll have to adjust now that it appears Texas will be starti= ng=20 out the next few seasons in the Top 10.=20 =09? =09 =09 =09 Q: Is Lee Jackson out for the Houston game?=20 =09?? Marty Bonner=20 =09 =09 BROWN:  Jackson is out for the Houston game with a hamstring pull suffe= red=20 against Stanford. He may also miss the Oklahoma State game. Mack Brown said= =20 this is a bad week to be without Jackson because Houston can throw the ball= =20 really well.=20 =09? =09 =09 =09 Q: Is Ricky Williams' jersey being retired at the Oklahoma State game S= ept.=20 30?=20 =09?? Mark Wilson=20 =09 =09 BROWN:  Yes. Williams' No. 34 will be retired at that game. Williams ha= s=20 said he will be there because the New Orleans Saints are off that weekend.= =20 Host Communications has also just finished a video biography on Williams th= at=20 will be available soon.=20 =09? =09 =09 =09 Q: What did Mack Brown say about the expectations surrounding his team = after=20 the loss to Stanford?=20 =09?? Virginia Blair=20 =09 =09 BROWN:  Again, here are Mack's words: ""I said during the pre-season tha= t we=20 were overrated. I didn't see any reason with the youth, the way we finished= =20 last year and the inexperience across the board that we should have been a= =20 Top 5 football team. One of the great things about Texas is that you receiv= e=20 a tremendous amount of attention and publicity, but in some cases people wa= nt=20 to push you too fast to get to the top. I think that we were in that positi= on=20 and expectations got out of hand. I knew that we would have a difficult gam= e=20 at Stanford and that it would be a tough game to win. I also didn't think= =20 that we deserved to be ranked fifth in the country.

"I'm soooo good.  The chosen path was cool, indifference.    So, last night was Steak Night and with Nick and Wilson both in town we had a  really good showing.  I got there about 7:30 with Nick, and the group's size  swelled to about 12+ by 8:30 - 9:00.  About 8:00 I saw Kevin (Ted's pal - the  one you meet a steak night) wandering around LW's obviously in search of  someone.  Can you believe it?  He (Ted) knew I had organized this gathering -  I know that because Nick is working right across from he and Darren and  overheard Darren encouraging Ted's attendance (mind you Ted was not in the  email distribution) - and he had the nerve to come.  Anyway, Kevin saw me and  came over to chat.  He informed me that ""our friend Ted should be there  shortly"" to which I responded, ""You would know better than me at this  point"".  The subject was dropped until he felt the need to raise it again.   He asked if Ted and I parted on good terms/ bad terms, etc.  I said there  really weren't any terms, I just hadn't heard a peep out of him for about 2  weeks.  Kevin wanted to know if I was going to break a bottle over Ted's head  and cause a big scene.  When I said no, I think he was genuinely  disappointed.  I said in order for me to do something like that I would have  to care about the ""loss"" and that, while a week or two earlier I might have  cared a bit more, with each passing day the ""loss"" seems less and less like  much of a loss.  Kevin told me I was better-off without Ted.  To go even  further, he informed me that there is no way he would ever let a daughter of  his date Ted nor any of his ""girl-friends"".  He said that while he thought  Ted was a great guy (i.e. fun to be around, good stories, etc.) he wasn't  good dating material.  I agreed with Kevin saying ""Ted is a great guy, he  just makes a lousy man"" (don't you like that one?).  I then went on to say  ""Anyway, I'm destined for bigger and better things, right?"".  Kevin: ""Much  bigger and much better.""  About this time my parents showed up...the plot  thickens.  I introduced Kevin to my parents and since both my Dad and Kevin  were in the Navy and attended Colorado they had much to talk about.  The two  of them had probably been talking for about half an hour when  ""dum-da-dum-dum"" Ted shows up.  He approaches our group because he sees Kevin  and is forced to make eye-contact with me.  I give him a ""hey"" and he gives  me the arm squeeze and a much too pleasant ""how's it going?"".  He asked what  Kevin and my Dad were talking about, I told him the Navy, he said don't get  Kevin started or you'll never shut him up...Then he walked away.  He never  acknowledged my parents nor did he ever speak to me again the rest of the  evening.  The beautiful thing is Kevin stays and talks with my Dad for  another half hour and when Darren shows up he hangs out with ""my group"" for  quite a while before going to join Ted.  My parents and I ate our steaks  right behind Ted and then went back over to our group at the picnic table  when we were finished.  It really was a great night.  I would almost say I  was glowing (I was having so much fun with my friends and family and it  wasn't a show for Ted's benefit...I really was having a great time).  So,  when my parents decide to head out they walked over to Ted/Kevin's table to  say good-bye to Kevin.  It was awesome.  Ted's sitting right next to Kevin  while Kevin and my Dad are talking and appears to be actually shrinking in  his chair.  Yet again no acknowledgement of my parents - he couldn't even  make eye-contact.  I ended up staying there for at least another hour and  then went with a few of the guys to the Ale House.  Needless to say I was  very hung over today.  Anyway, there's the story...He's a complete and utter  ass-hole.  So I'm done.  And no, there is no way he could weasel his way back  in to my good graces.    Now on to a fun subject, my trip to London.  I bought my ticket today ( I  think I got hosed a little bit, but it was the cheapest ticket I could find -  $450 before taxes).  I will arrive at Heathrow airport around 7:00 a.m.  Friday the 6th and depart about 11:00 a.m. on Tuesday the 10th.  I'm very  excited about the trip, I really need to get out of Houston.

I suggested both the Dan Electro and the Going Out Downtown ideas to Craig, and we got off on a tangent and never made a decision, except that he is coming over at 7:30.  Now I'm faced with the dilemma of what to wear (only a problem when I go out with Craig).  Should I: a) call him at home later and ask him where we're going b) wear something noncommittal that wouldn't be especially appropriate at either venue c) wear jeans and change into something nicer if we go downtown d) wear a slipdress and change into jeans if we go to the Heights hinterlands?

"It's kind of funny, everybody has the same feeling about the ""Ted situation""  - utter disappointment.  But yes, it is definitely his loss.  And, I loved  the fact that Kevin (his friend) spent so much time talking to my Dad because  that had to make Ted feel like a complete jerk (which he is).  I'm am very excited about my trip to London.  The other guy I mentioned in  the email, Darren, is going to be working over there for a few months so I'll  get to see him there as well.  Plus, in November I'm going to visit my  brother and his wife in South Korea which should be interesting.  The globe  trotting continues.  Your weekend sounds like it's going to be pretty fun.  I wish I could be  there as well, but it is football season so I will be in Austin this  weekend.

"Lindy, FERC has consistently held that pipelines may make ""operational"" sales  of gas.  Specifically this has included occasional sales of gas resulting  from cashout requirements and the buying and selling of gas to maintain  linepack levels.  TW's sale of excess linepack gas would probably be fine.   By contrast, buying gas then turning around and reselling it would be suspect  as it would look too much like our unbundled merchant function.  Let me know if you have further questions.       Lindy Donoho 09/20/2000 04:43 PM To: Steven Harris/ET&S/Enron@ENRON, Susan Scott/ET&S/Enron@ENRON cc:    Subject: TW Buy/Sell Gas For Operations  In our Plan meeting, we were discussing UAF and Operation's objective to  reduce it.  Operation's objective is a volumetric goal, but we are at risk  for the gas price.  It started me thinking about our whole fuel expense.   TW's fuel expense is valued on our books at the TW systemwide index.  Should  TW be hedging the fuel that we burn?  Jan-Aug, 2000 (acctg months) Y-T-D fuel  expense is at $21MM ($2.6MM/month) at a total volume of 6.7 Bcf.  This  summer, with high gas prices and Gallup in service, our fuel has been ranging  $3.4-3.8MM a month.  Operations has objectives to minimize the fuel use, but  not the price.    How could we hedge our fuel used?  Would we sell all the fuel retained (hedge  it as high as possible) and manage our fuel expense separately through its  own purchasing and hedging (as low as possible) effort?  Could we have hedged  some portion of our fuel usage last year for this year at $2.36 (like we  hedged our excess fuel) and not be subject to the high prices we're seeing  this summer?  Do you think there is an opportunity here to manage our fuel expense more  effectively?  Susan, I think you had looked at TW's ability to buy/sell gas a few months back  (when we were looking at fuel monetization).  What did the FERC Order say  about under what circumstances TW could buy/sell gas?  ",lindy.donoho@enron.com,susan.scott@enron.com,Re: TW Buy/Sell Gas For Operations,2000-09-22 07:45:00-07:00,sent
"You had a question about the meaning of Section 4.3.  Here's a brief  explanation.  Section 4.2 covers indemnification in case one party gets sued by a third  party for damage caused by negligence of the other party.  I'm OK with  eliminating ""stockholders"" and the ""...judgments of any nature..."" clause you  two spoke about on the phone as long as they come out of both subparagraphs  a. and b.  Section 4.3 needs to stay in because it covers any potential action by EPFS  against TW for damage to EPFS's facilities during the term of the agreement.   TW is already obligated elsewhere in the agreement to construct and operate  the facilities in accordance with industry practice, tariff and DOT  standards.  Our policy in interconnect agreements is that if TW complies with  these standards we should not then somehow be liable for damage to EPFS in  case of explosion, etc.  In other words, both parties bear the risk attached  to something unforeseeable going wrong notwithstanding use of industry and  DOT standards. (By the way, I believe the ""notwithstanding anything in this Article 4 to the  contrary"" language should come out; I'm not sure why it's in the draft.)

The chosen path was cool, indifference.    So, last night was Steak Night and with Nick and Wilson both in town we had a  really good showing.  I got there about 7:30 with Nick, and the group's size  swelled to about 12+ by 8:30 - 9:00.  About 8:00 I saw Kevin (Ted's pal - the  one you meet a steak night) wandering around LW's obviously in search of  someone.  Can you believe it?  He (Ted) knew I had organized this gathering -  I know that because Nick is working right across from he and Darren and  overheard Darren encouraging Ted's attendance (mind you Ted was not in the  email distribution) - and he had the nerve to come.  Anyway, Kevin saw me and  came over to chat.  He informed me that ""our friend Ted should be there  shortly"" to which I responded, ""You would know better than me at this  point"".  The subject was dropped until he felt the need to raise it again.   He asked if Ted and I parted on good terms/ bad terms, etc.  I said there  really weren't any terms, I just hadn't heard a peep out of him for about 2  weeks.  Kevin wanted to know if I was going to break a bottle over Ted's head  and cause a big scene.  When I said no, I think he was genuinely  disappointed.  I said in order for me to do something like that I would have  to care about the ""loss"" and that, while a week or two earlier I might have  cared a bit more, with each passing day the ""loss"" seems less and less like  much of a loss.  Kevin told me I was better-off without Ted.  To go even  further, he informed me that there is no way he would ever let a daughter of  his date Ted nor any of his ""girl-friends"".  He said that while he thought  Ted was a great guy (i.e. fun to be around, good stories, etc.) he wasn't  good dating material.  I agreed with Kevin saying ""Ted is a great guy, he  just makes a lousy man"" (don't you like that one?).  I then went on to say  ""Anyway, I'm destined for bigger and better things, right?"".  Kevin: ""Much  bigger and much better.""  About this time my parents showed up...the plot  thickens.  I introduced Kevin to my parents and since both my Dad and Kevin  were in the Navy and attended Colorado they had much to talk about.  The two  of them had probably been talking for about half an hour when  ""dum-da-dum-dum"" Ted shows up.  He approaches our group because he sees Kevin  and is forced to make eye-contact with me.  I give him a ""hey"" and he gives  me the arm squeeze and a much too pleasant ""how's it going?"".  He asked what  Kevin and my Dad were talking about, I told him the Navy, he said don't get  Kevin started or you'll never shut him up...Then he walked away.  He never  acknowledged my parents nor did he ever speak to me again the rest of the  evening.  The beautiful thing is Kevin stays and talks with my Dad for  another half hour and when Darren shows up he hangs out with ""my group"" for  quite a while before going to join Ted.  My parents and I ate our steaks  right behind Ted and then went back over to our group at the picnic table  when we were finished.  It really was a great night.  I would almost say I  was glowing (I was having so much fun with my friends and family and it  wasn't a show for Ted's benefit...I really was having a great time).  So,  when my parents decide to head out they walked over to Ted/Kevin's table to  say good-bye to Kevin.  It was awesome.  Ted's sitting right next to Kevin  while Kevin and my Dad are talking and appears to be actually shrinking in  his chair.  Yet again no acknowledgement of my parents - he couldn't even  make eye-contact.  I ended up staying there for at least another hour and  then went with a few of the guys to the Ale House.  Needless to say I was  very hung over today.  Anyway, there's the story...He's a complete and utter  ass-hole.  So I'm done.  And no, there is no way he could weasel his way back  in to my good graces.    Now on to a fun subject, my trip to London.  I bought my ticket today ( I  think I got hosed a little bit, but it was the cheapest ticket I could find -  $450 before taxes).

"I've redlined the outline to address what I believe is the most important  risk you guys will face out there:  the risk that FERC will listen to your  presentation and conclude that the embedded optionality that some pipelines  are currently offering in transport contracts is a negotiated term and  condition and therefore must be stopped.  I think we need to tailor the  presentation and filing to minimize the chance that FERC will take away  flexibility we think we now have (i.e., the flexibility to embed shipper puts  in transport contracts).   Even if the TW approach on unbundled options goes  nowhere, several of the strategies we may want to implement next year depend  on continued ability to sell embedded options.

"Everything goes O.K.  I met with Ted last week for dinner Thursday night...it  was VERY enlightening.  I'll forward you the email I sent to my sister-in-law  (it sums everything up pretty well).  Let me know if you want to grab coffee,  a drink, etc. tonight or tomorrow night - although I think you've got NCL  tomorrow.    Well, we met and had dinner last night.  NOTHING of importance was discussed  during our entire meal and it was only when I brought things up as we were  leaving that any actual ""talking"" occurred.  Here are the basics...  - There is definitely no ""us"" anymore...and I quote ""sometimes these things  just fade out"" - There is much I didn't know about him and I am sure even more that I still  don't - Case in point...He was MARRIED before (yes, you read correctly married) - Turns out he's been divorced about three years, it didn't end well and he  hasn't had a relationship that has lasted beyond       2 mos. in those three  years (even though, by his own admission, he has dated quite a bit) - Can you  say issues? - He told me ""I know this sounds so trite, but this really has nothing to do  with you, it's all me.""  Of course I agreed with him saying ""I know it's you  Ted, I don't have any problems."" (He got a chuckle out of that one) - I told him about my frustrations and disappointment with how he had handled  things and he apologised (evidently Kevin told him about our exchange at  Steak Night) and I also let him know how much I appreciated his handling of  things in the beginning - I said I really hated animosity and hard feelings and that as long as he  hadn't done anything truly horrible to me (i.e. murder a family member, etc.)  I would really like to leave things on a good note...He agreed. - He said I was a fantastic girl and that he still really enjoyed hanging out  and talking with me (although I don't see us doing a lot of that...not very  healthy for me)   So all in all I walked away with three very important things 1. A lightened  load (I got everything of my chest that I wanted to and needed to) 2. My  dignity (I handled just it as I'd hoped...with composure and wit) 3. A  clearer since of Ted as a person (He definitely has a lot of issues in his  life that he has not completely dealt with yet, and might never deal with  completely)  Anyway, I'm okay with everything and surprisingly feel pretty good.  I'll  talk to you soon.

"Hey,  It's 8:30 and I'm still at work.  Did I mention I really need this vacation?   Anyway, I have a couple of questions for you.  Is there anything special  you'd like me to bring over (that your Mom isn't getting for you).  I talked  to your Mom yesterday and she mentioned a craving for Turkey Jerky.  If you  want me to bring some over just let me know where to buy it.  Also, do you  have any predictions for the weather.  I'm planning on bringing the following  - jeans, sweatshirt, black pants & skirt, black cardigan, ""rain coat"" (I put  it in quotes b/c I know mine won't be official), some ""go out"" close, running  shoes, heels, and boots, 2 sweaters, varying tops, and a pair of shorts.  I  always end up over-packing, but I'm really going to try to pare down.  I'm  assuming you have a blow-dryer so I can leave mine at home.   I talked to Darren today and he said Friday sounded good...and, I sent an  email to Nick so hopefully it will work for him as well.  I also emailed  Jessica's friend Ashley who's living over there and she wanted to get  together maybe for lunch or something over the weekend.   I've been checking out the Tube Maps on the Web and don't think I should have  much of a problem getting to your place.  I assume I'm going to want to get  off at the Holland Park tube stop.

Anyway, Trav's pledge  class had a reunion at the house after the game and I think it may have  single-handedly cured me of wanting men in their early thirties.  The single  guys from their class are definitely still single for a reason.  Also, you've  gotta tell Chuck that Kinzer's date for the game was a year younger than me  (although I will say, after meeting her, you would've thought she was much  younger).

It has taken up to 3 hours due to the  amount of questions from the attendees.   One  focus of these meetings is to give the field staff a better  understanding of the impact  UAF has on our bottom line (TW) and  the impact  it has on our shipper costs (NNG).   Yesterday, 10/4/00 I had the opportunity to meet with several members of the  financial group in Houston to discuss UAF.  Coming out of that meeting was a  request to schedule a Houston presentation on ""UAF Fundamentals"".  This has  been done, and will be at 1 PM on Oct. 18, 2000. (Place yet to be determined.)

He is very fun and very sweet but just a tad bit flighty; still think he has some growing up to do.  That's why I warned Dianna that he would probably just be someone to go out on a few dates with, for fun. I really don't think he's ready to settle down at all.  On the other hand, he's fun to be with, and has a way of making you feel that you're the only woman in the room.  That kind of attention (the lighthearted, no-strings-attached kind) might be just what you need right now.  The problem with Dianna was that she instantly fell in love with him, and of course was very frustrated when he did not call every day or want to hang out all the time.  She finally started acting a little cold towards him. His take on the situation:  she expects too much! The only difficulty might be that John could be leery of dating my friends by now!

"The attached draft reflects revisions made pursuant to our discussions with  FERC staff.  You will be receiving a hard copy of the tariff sheets  separately.  Please make sure you read the ""Waivers"" section towards the end of the  document as it contains some additional requests for waivers.  Also, there seems to be some confusion over whether we are going to post all  options, not just Shipper call options.  My previous drafts have provided for  posting of Shipper call options only.  All other types of options will be  generally available, on a nondiscriminatory basis, through our tariff.  My  thinking was that it is commercially impracticable to post the specifics of  all types of options, and it's not necessary since options will be noted on  our transaction reports required by Order 637.

Right now, we are in the midst of several internal control reviews  related to various risk areas.   We are currently testing the risk that NNG and TW reserves (regulatory, legal  contingencies, etc.) are inappropriately valued and/or established.  One of  the controls that Accounting cited to mitigate this risk was that both Legal  and Rates reviewed the NNG and TW FERC Form No. 2s prior to issuance.  Harry  Walters and Allen Joe mentioned to us that there is no formal ""sign-off"" or  approval process by Legal and Rates of the Form 2s, but instead, drafts were  sent to the groups and any comments were then reviewed with Accounting.  Your  names were mentioned as those they sent the 1999 Form 2 drafts to for Legal  to review (Maria-NNG and Susan-TW).

"Hey Em,  Well it's 8:30 Friday night and surprise I'm still at the office.  I love  this place!!!  To answer your question, yes I am definitely suffering  withdrawal.  I will be working very hard over the next few months to cure  that though.  Nothing really exciting to report here except A) Nick called me  my first day back in the office to make sure I arrived home safely ( I really  don't know what to do about all of that)  B) Ben keeps calling me to see if I  want to go out - 2 nights in a row in addition to our Steak Night beer (I  haven't gone either night).  How ironic is all of this?  I've got one guy  worrying and thinking of me that I care nothing for...I've got another guy  who I at one time cared for but no longer do trying to take advantage of my  vulnerable state (which in truth isn't really vulnerable at all) and another  guy, who I until fairly recently cared for, who I think could go the rest of  his life without ever seeing/speaking to me again (Or course I guess the  reverse of that is true as well).  Talk to you soon, Susan  Positive notes:  I think Ted is getting greying and losing hair with the  added stress of corn trading.  He looks old and pitiful.

"Susan,  I don't know if my dad told you, but I am at Tulane law school and enjoying it very much.  The work is challeging, but I am really happy with the my choice of paths.  The campus is beautiful, the people are normal, the town is amazing (a bit distracting at times), and my professors and the law school in general are fantastic.  I am writing you to ask for your advice.  They are beginning to apply the job search pressure to us (it is already the 8th week) and I am trying to figure out my best course of action.  I have heard that most of the big firms in Houston aren't even looking for students after only their 1st year-- that they prefer to interview after the 2nd year for summer clerk positions and then associate jobs. Do you know of any smaller firms or specific attorneys that I might be able to pursue with a letter and resume?  What did you do after your first year?  Did you stay in Texas?  I do know that I want to practice in Houston, so I think that working there during this, my first summer, would be a smart idea.  It will at least give me more time to make contacts/ meet people.  What do you think?  Any thoughts/advice you have would be greatly appreciated.   Thank you, Katy",susan.scott@enron.com,ktgotts@aol.com,Necesito consejos,2000-10-16 10:51:00-07:00,received

I'm Al Gore, and I'd like to tell you about myself. I know a lot about hardship, because I came into this world as a poor black child in a tiny town in the backwoods of Tennessee.  I was born in a log cabin that I built with my own hands.  I taught myself to read by candlelight and helped support my 16 brothers and sisters by working summers as a deck hand on a Mississippi River steamboat.  My mother taught me the value of education, so every day I would walk 5 miles to a one-room schoolhouse.  I was a mischievous, fun-loving scamp, thought I never dreamed that one-day, my youthful escapades would serve as the inspiration for ""Huckleberry Finn.""  Back then, black folks in the south were second-class citizens. One day, a traveling minister came through town, and I asked him if anyone was ever going to do something to guarantee civil rights for all Americans.  Well, I guess I made an impression.  You see, the minister's name was Martin Luther King, Jr.  My father was a United States Senator.  He once perched me on his knee and said, ""Son, if you work hard and listen to your mama, someday you can live in a hotel in Washington, D.C., and go to an exclusive prep school.""  But life of privilege was not for me.  After getting my high school diploma, I took a job in a hot, dirty textile mill.  I was so appalled at the treatment of the workers there that I organized a union. Later, that experience inspired a movie - which is why, to this day, my close friends at the AFL-CIO call me ""Norma Rae.""  When word got out what an 18 year old factory worker had done, Harvard called and offered me a scholarship.  I captained the hockey team to four consecutive national championships, but I also played football and was good enough to win the Heisman Trophy.  During my college years, I lived in a housing project and moonlighted playing lead guitar for a little rock band.  You may have heard of it -- the Rolling Stones.  But there was a war going on, and I felt I had to serve my country.  So I enlisted in the U.  S.  Army and went to Vietnam.  I was deeply opposed to the war, but I did my duty as a soldier and came back home with the Medal of Honor and the Croix de Guerre.  When I got back, I took a long journey across this great land of ours. I've crossed the deserts bare, man, I've breathed the mountain air, man, I've traveled, I've done my share, man, I've been everywhere. And the people I met at truckstops and campgrounds and homeless shelters on that journey all said the same thing: ""Al, we need you in Washington.""  I knew they were right, but first I had to take care of some other business---building the World Trade Center, founding the Audubon Society, doing the clinical research that proved smoking caused cancer, and coming up with the recipe for Mrs.  Field's chocolate chip cookies.  Finally, I deferred to the demands of the people of Tennessee and allowed them to elect me to the House of Representatives and the Senate, where I established the US Strategic Oil Reserve.  And then one winter day nearly nine years ago, for no particular reason, I answered the call of the people once again and took the oath of office as Vice President of the United States.  Since then, I've been part of the most successful administration in American history.  And, in my spare time, I invented the Internet. Many times Bill Clinton has been pondering some grave decision and has asked me what to do.  And when I would give him my thoughts, he would invariable say, ""Of course.  That's brilliant.  Why didn't I think of that?"" During the darkest days of the impeachment battle, the president told me he only wished he had listened when I told him to stay away form that dark-haired intern.  So after I decided to run for president, I sat down with him and asked if he had any suggestions about how to conduct my campaign. And Bill Clinton gave me a few simple words of advice -- words I'll never forget.  He looked me in the eye and he said, ""Al, just tell the truth, it's always worked for me.""

"Southern Trails proposed, at an estimated cost of $155,000,000, a pipeline  project consisting mostly of 693 miles of crude oil pipeline acquired from  ARCO.  Ten percent of the project would be new construction and the remainder  would be conversion of the crude oil line to gas service.  The pipeline  system would be divided into an East Zone and a West Zone.  The East Zone,  which will begin in the San Juan Basin and end at the California border, will  have 87,500 Dth/d of available capacity.  The West Zone, wholly within  California, will have 120,000 Dth/d.    Southern Trails received certificate authority for the project on July  28,2000.  An optional certificate application does not require any showing of  market need; however, Southern Trails did hold an open season from Sept. to  Oct. 1998 during which it received 22 bids totalling 810,000 Dth/d of  demand.  The order issuing the certificate did not say how much of the  capacity had been subscribed, only that Southern Trails had contracted with  its affiliate, Questar Energy, for 30,000 Dth/d of firm capacity in theh East  Zone for 5 years and one month, and taht firm transportation service  agreements of 5 and 10 year terms are ""being negotiated"" with prospective  shippers which, if executed, would subscribe the balance of the capacity in  both the East and West zones.    TW is an intervenor in this docket so I have received everything that has  been filed.  I have no further information about any further subscription of  capacity.  I also have no information regarding any progress that has been  made on construction. If you need a more detailed summary of the proposal that was filed at FERC,  or if you have any other questions, please let me know and I'll see what I  can find.

"Colleen, thank you so much for your very prompt attention to this.  I  definitely had the wrong version of the agreement. Jeff confirmed by voice mail this morning that even though we already  included the 5.4 language in the draft we sent him back in March, he does  find it objectionable and will want to modify it, so he will be very  interested in seeing your suggested language too.  Please send your attachment ""CalpineO&M 10-18-00 edits to draft03-20-00"".  Again, thank you so much for your help with this.  (Calpine has finally woken  up and realized they want this in place Nov. 1...) I will let you know how negotiations are shaping up.      Colleen Raker 10/18/2000 07:35 PM To: Susan Scott/ET&S/Enron@ENRON cc:    Subject: Draft- Operating Agreement  Attached below is Jeff Fawsett's  3/22/00 note to Calpine with TW's 3/20/00  draft of the Operating Agreement .  What changes if any did Calpine require  to this draft?  Please note that Section 5.4 of the attached 3/20/00 draft is  substantively identical to my further-revised Section 5.4 (with subsections A  and B) that I forwarded to you a few days after Jeff's note to Calpine.   From our meeting this morning I understand that Jeff appears adverse to  Transwestern's claiming zero financial responsibility for damages to  Calpine's Measurement and Control Facilities that result from TW's O&M  Services.  Consequently, I made some modifications to Articles 4 and 5 of the  3/20/00 draft for TW management's consideration.  These changes are noted in  the attached document marked ""CalpineO&M 10-18-00 edits to draft03-20-00"".   With my 10-18-00 revisions, TW places a limit on its liability to Calpine for  loss or damage incurred by Calpine due to TW's Services, including loss or  damage to the existing M&C Facilities,  if and to the extent damage is caused  by TW's negligent acts or omissions.  To complete my modification to Section  5.3, TW is to insert the maximum aggregate amount of financial liability it  is willing to assume in any contract year.  This amount could be the amount  of Calpine's deductible on its property insurance coverage or a lesser  amount.  Whatever the amount chosen, please remember that TW is self-insured  for the first $2M, each occurrence.  Therefore, what is the amount of risk  that TW is willing to pay out of its earnings if Calpine claims damage to its  existing Facility due to TW's negligent operations?  That is the amount to  insert in the blank space in Section 5.3.    FYI, the changes in Sections 3.1 and 4.1 (b) and (c), and the striking of  Section 4.1 (d) do not create any substantive changes to the 3/20/00 draft.   I  made the latter changes for stylistic reasons and to correct typos and  redundancies.  Please call me if you have any questions and to let me know  the status of this document.  I have lost track of my notes on the status of  TW Operations' review and approval of the list of Services included in  Exhibit B; this needs to be determined by Jeff (or his designee) before the  final definitive agreement is prepared for signing.   ---------------------- Forwarded by Colleen Raker/ET&S/Enron on 10/18/2000  06:34 PM ---------------------------   Jeffery Fawcett 03/22/2000 12:26 PM To: chadd@calpine.com cc:  (bcc: Colleen Raker/ET&S/Enron)  Subject: Draft- Operating Agreement  Chad, Sorry it took so long to get back with you, but we've had some folks out  (including me) on Spring Break with their kids.

"Your welcome.    As for myself, I'm doing pretty good these days.  I've been up in Austin  practically every weekend for the games and have actually been managing to go  out a bit more here in Houston during the week in an effort to become social  again.  There isn't too much new in Tejas...the weather's still warm and a  bit on the muggy side, but what can you expect it's only almost November.   Today is Wednesday, so of course Steak Night is on the agenda for this  evening.  Actually, the guy who trained me for my current job is leaving  Enron and his happy hour just happens to be at Little Woodrow's tonight - how  convenient.  On the man front, I've put myself back out on the ""market"" so to  speak and have a couple of pursuant suitors right now (although, I don't know  that in the end any of them will pass muster).  Unfortunately for them I am  somewhat sceptical of guys in general these days (especially ones that I  can't get background information on through friends), but I'm trying not to  let that color my opinion too much.

"Bug had a busy Halloween at school- Big kids dressed up trick or treated at all the classrooms and bug was the only baby still awake during this time so they put her in a high chair to watch all of the action.  She fell asleep on the short ride home which she never does. We bought her an outifit to wear at Old Navy that's not really a ""costume"". It is an orange one piece thing with these cute smiling spiders on it that says ""silly spiders"". It was a little boyish, but the pumpkin motif suit was on white t-shirt material and I knew it would be totally stained by the end of the day.  The orange hid those pesky carrots and peaches! We took pictures of her holding on to the gourd jack-o-lantern yesterday morning.  I think she enjoyed watching the kids come to our door for candy, but she really didn't like the doorbell much at all. The ""Hamlets"" slummed it and left their million dollar house area of Alamo Heights to come trick or treat on the old street.  They brought new baby whose name sounds like Frayton - not sure how to spell - but it was fun to see them again.

"Jessica,  I'm sorry I never got in touch with you last weekend, but I had the wrong  phone number with me and didn't have enough brain power to think of using  Information.  I don't think I would have been much fun anyway since I pretty  much just ended up sleeping the whole weekend.  In fact, I fell asleep in the  car on the ride back to my sister's house after the game and my parents  decided to just leave me in the car.  I think I was probably out there for an  hour before I woke up (needless to say I was very confused).  Anyway, hope  things are going well for you and Clay.  I know everything must be kind of  crazy for both of you right now with finals coming up and all of the  interviewing you've both no doubt been doing.   I really want to get a chance to see you and chat...I don't feel like we've  had a good one in forever.  I will be in Austin over Thanksgiving for the  game, so we could try to touch base then if you're going to be in town.

The OII orders the Sempra affiliates and parent to > demonstrate that SDG&E's gas supply and transmission system are adequate > to provide service to present and future core and noncore customers. >  >       As you may recall, the OII sprang from an AL that SDG&E > filed in August requesting emergency review and approval of its proposals > to temporarily revise gas transportation service elections to its noncore > customers.  SDG&E subsequently pulled the advice letter after the > Commission issued a resolution rejecting it and outlined an OII it was > going to issue on this matter.

WASHINGTON (AP) - Following an emergency meeting this morning, Congress unanimously voted to eject Florida from the United States of America.  The move was a reaction to the confusion and irregularities in the state's voting numbers that have totally disrupted the 2000 Presidential election.  ""This is the last straw,"" said Utah senator Orin Hatch. ""First Elian Gonzales, now this.""  Several congressmen told reporters the decision has been a long time in coming.  ""We're all pretty much sick of Florida,"" said representative Barney Frank. ""They've been a constant embarrassment for too long now.""  Added Frank, ""They had Dan Marino for a while, but what have they done lately? Oh, that's right; screw up our entire democracy. I forgot.""  In a speech on the Senate floor, Massachusetts senator Ted Kennedy commented that the loss of Florida's sizable elderly population will free up billions of dollars in Social Security funds.  ""These are valuable funds which can now be redirected toward national defense. We can finally rebuild our demoralized, weakened military,"" said the Senator to roaring applause.  As a result of the Florida screw-up, the House and Senate decreed a new election will take place in early December. This time, ballots in each state will be tabulated by robots.  ""It is clear that our human vote-counting system is too inherently flawed,"" said Speaker of the House Dennis Hastert. ""The presence of these new, superior robot mast- umm, I mean - tabulators will ensure 100% accuracy.""  ""Remember,"" said Hastert, ""every vote counts, especially if it's counted by robots.""  Dynamiting will begin in Florida next Wednesday, after which the state will be completely geographically separated from the United States.  ""After that, they're on their own,"" said Hastert.

Everytime I go, I come home thinking we should forget all family gift-giving and concentrate our efforts on Whoville! Anyway, it's Marge's birthday and this is what she wanted to do, so we went with all the hoards and dined on a cold pasta lunch and cold ice tea in the tearoom for $10.  We were very disappointed when we saw people walking around upstairs with cheese and chili smothered hotdogs!  Parking a mess--no lots at Palmer due to construction.  So, satellite parking with shuttle buses.  Took an hour at 2 p.m. from waiting in line to arriving at the car in Zilker, but the only civil way to handle it.

"From astrology.com (must I beware of overindulgence in such websites?) I like the part about charm and charisma and think it is very true.  Sagittarius and Sagittarius When two Sagittarians join together in a love match, the truth-loving natures  makes theirs a near perfect relationship. This couple views the world around  them with an educated eye and both share an intense hunger for more  knowledge. They will engage one another in pleasant conversation and  banter that challenges and tickles the mind.  An occasional hotheaded dispute  can erupt in the Sagittarius-Sagittarius relationship, when one fact-fanatic  Sag  partner carries things a little too far. Easygoing and independent, these two  are  compatible when it comes to balancing personal interests. They've never known  jealousy, and each partner keeps busy with personal projects when not with  their  lover. When they are together, however, they do all they can toward pleasing  their partner and satiating common interests.  Although they are adaptable  and  modern, they can, at times, fly off the handle. However, it is not in the  Archer's  nature to hold a grudge or let disagreements fester very long.   Sagittarius is ruled by the Planet Jupiter (Luck). Expansion is the key word  here;  as both partners enjoy the acquisition of knowledge, they will carry over  exciting  ideas into their relationship. They must be mindful of over-indulgences, as  such  gluttony will only distract them. Their charm and charisma make them a very  pleasant couple not only to one another, but the entire crowd.

"Hey Wilson,  Yep, I'm still in Houston for the time being...I'll probably be here through  March of next year when my current rotation ends.  Everything's going pretty  well, work is still consisting of long hours but I think ultimately the hard  work is going to pay off.  In fact, the whole London thing is looking pretty  good right now.  There might be an opportunity for me to get into some  structuring and originating roles over there which is much more along the  lines of where I'd like to go (versus this whole trader support thing - great  experience for the time being, but definitely not a permanent role).  Glad to  hear things are still well with you.  Sounds like you're still the same old  Wilson...working deals and hooking-up.  You'll have to let me know when  you're going to be in town so we can get the gang together to go out.  It  looks like Darren's going to be back in town for about 6 weeks or so coming  up so hopefully we could all make a steak night reunion.    I've been going out quite a bit as well and have had a couple dates, but  nothing really to speak of.  I was kind of on a rampage over the last month  just messing with guys heads (flirting, getting them to buy me drinks, giving  them my number and then completely ignoring them).  I think it was some need  I had to treat your entire gender like shit.  I'm pretty much over it  though.  It's not really in my nature to be like that, just a reactionary  thing for having been treated like crap myself.    Keep in touch and let me know when you're going to be in town.

"Hi!  Saw some clear glass votive holders on a long stem at Smith-Hawken the other day that I thought might be different on the table for the holidays. Don't know if they're in the catalog and don't know how much they are.  Am looking at some fireplace tools that Breed sells by the piece.  Interested in tongs, poker, shovel.  But don't know if I want them on a stand or not, and that gets pricey.  Also need a new bellows.  Breed also has a leather and metal log holder that's nice looking--but that also may be pricey.

"As to your question about what's going on in California, I've done some  reading and here are my thoughts.  The Nov. 1 FERC order in Docket No. EL00-95-000, in which the Commission  ordered a $150/MWh price cap (among other things), was predicated on the  Commission's authority under Section 206 of the Federal Power Act.   Specifically, the FPA provides that if the Commission finds that ""any rate,  charge or classification for jurisdictional services, or any rule,  regulation, practice or contract affecting such rate, charge or  classification"" is unjust or unreasonable, the Commission shall determine the  just and reasonable rate, charge, classification, rule, regulation, practice,  or contract that should be in effect.  The Commission recognized that certain  areas of the flawed California market are not within its jurisdiction, but  ""fixed"" the areas within its jurisdiction.   Apparently the California  governor agrees with me that the Commission's jurisdiction in the area of  wholesale electricity prices is questionable...  In any event, if the Commission wanted to open a proceeding to investigate  the justness and reasonableness of negotiated gas transportation rates, its  authority to do so would be much clearer.  The Natural Gas Act expressly  authorizes FERC to declare unlawful any transportation rate that is not just  and reasonable.  ""Just and reasonable"" has been interpreted in many different  contexts and the Commission has significant discretion over what it means.   As we all know too well, the Commission sometimes acts unpredictably.   However, my feeling is that it will probably take more than 2 or 3  above-max-rate contracts to motivate the FERC to act to declare a negotiated  rate deal, struck within a pipeline's tariff authority, to be unjust and  unreasonable.  The California proceeding was initiated after entire  communities of individual consumers suffered 200-300% increases in their  electricity bills.  The prices for electricity in California were outrageous  across the board and affected everyone in the state.  By contrast, TW's  transport rates for its short-term deals are far removed from end user prices  and the practice of negotiating higher than max rate deals is probably not  widespread enough for anyone to notice.  It is far from being a consumer  issue, and besides, the elections are over.  However, as you and I have  already discussed, we must be wary of parties like Dynegy that do notice just  about everything and who might try to draw it to FERC's attention.  We do  need to watch to see whether other pipelines serving California are doing the  same types of deals.  Kathy, why don't you and I discuss a system of  monitoring the contract information postings of El Paso, Kern, PGT/NW.  Drew,  obviously I've only scratched the surface here so let's talk if you want a  more in-depth report.

You know, the laws that say you can't  charge $100 per sheet of plywood during a hurricane or $50 for a bucket of  water during a drought.  I think we need to research two things: 1.  are there any such laws applicable to our business?  (Cal. state law  would probably be the best place to start) 2.  could the political/regulatory fight in Cal about power and gas prices  ever expand all the way to our transport pricing?  I.e., if the CPUC whacks  the power sellers for taking unfair advantage of their monopoly power, its  not a big leap for the CPUC or FERC or even U.S. congress to whack gas  sellers for jacking prices up to $14/MMBtu, as happened on Friday.  If that  happens, its just another small jump to whack us for charging $1 for  transport, or so the logic goes.  I'd like to hear preliminary views by 8:30  Monday am so I can talk to Mike before Stan's staff meeting (no written memo  necessary).

"Excellent reading of the legal authority issues as well as the political  winds.  I think your sense of the likelihood of trouble is accurate.  I also  agree with your implicit premise that if FERC or anyone else wanted to make  trouble regarding our negotiated rate deals, the easiest approach, and the  most direct one, is to challenge the deals as unjust and unreasonable under  NGA section 4/5.

"Remember we need to make a filing for our BP Energy deal, which becomes  effective Dec. 1.  (Mary, I think you and I talked about this several weeks  ago).  The contract simply includes a right of first refusal for BP Energy.   The contract is such that the shipper would not have been entitled to a ROFR  under our tariff, which is why it's a material deviation. The filing will simply need to reference a tariff sheet on which the contract  provision is described. Let me know if you need anything (a copy of the contract, for instance).

"Maria and Drew, this is a long-winded e-mail but please bear with me...  The problem:  As you probably remember, several months ago several of us met to discuss the  following language in the ROFR portion of Transwestern's tariff: ""if the rate  bid exceeds the maximum tariff rate, then the rate will be considered to be  the maximum tariff rate,"" and the additional frustrating language ""[a]ll  available capacity shall be allocated under these procedures . . ..""  At our  last meeting, we concluded that probably the best way to ensure that TW could  capture the true value of the capacity would be to link the negotiated rate  to index prices.  However, since this usually involves an unacceptable amount  of risk to both the shipper and TW, the marketers haven't done any  index-based rates and have no current plans to enter into any such deals.  I  have been asked by the Commercial Group to revisit this issue and to think of  other ways we could increase our ability to charge more than the maximum  rate.   Ideally they would like to eliminate the language I've quoted above.   However, my research has indicated that absent our 1) bringing about radical  change in the way FERC thinks about recourse rates or 2) showing that TW  lacks market power, we are probably stuck with this language.  Why the problem exists (you may already know):  Steve Stojic and I did some looking into why the language is in our tariff in  the first place.  In the Alternative Rates Policy Statement (RM95-6-000), the  Commission explained that it is willing to entertain individual requests for  negotiated rates, but only where customers retain the ability to choose a  cost-of-service based tariff rates.  ""[T]he availability of a recourse  service would prevent pipelines from exercising market power by assuring that  the customer can fall back to cost-based, traditional service if the pipeline  unilaterally demands excessive prices or withholds service.  Thus, the  recourse rate mitigates market power.""    The Commission went on to confirmed that under ROFR provisions the highest  rate that an existing shipper must match if it wishes to continue its  transportation arrangement is the maximum tariff rate. This policy is clearly  not limited to ROFR situations:  when capacity is constrained, a shipper  willing to pay only the recourse rate cannot lose access to capacity merely  because someone else is willing to pay a negotiated rate.  ""When there are  more requests for capacity than there is capacity available, then the  pipeline must allocate capacity among those shippers willing to pay either  the negotiated rate or the maximum recourse rate, for example on a pro rata  basis if required by its tariff.""  The example cited by the Commission:  If a  pipeline has 100 Dth/d available and two shippers request that capacity, one  who is willing to pay no more than the recourse rate of $5 and another a  negotiated rate of $6, then each would be allocated 50 Dth/d on a pro rata  basis (assuming the tariff provided for pro rata allocation and not some  other allocation method such as lottery).    When TW filed for authority to charge negotiated rates, it voluntarily added  the statement that ""if the rate bid exceeds the maximum tariff rate, then the  rate will be considered to be the maximum tariff rate.""  Presumably we had  concluded that we needed to add this recourse rate related provision in order  to receive negotiated rate authority.    Solutions??  I would like to know whether you concur that changing our tariff language  outright is probably out of the question.  I feel as if I've really been  chasing my tail here.  I have owed Lindy an answer for some time now.  But I  keep coming back to our having to prove lack of market power (which, Drew, is  where I believe you were headed when we talked about this in mid-October).   Steve Harris has asked whether we can just start small and remove the  recourse rate cap as to only a portion of our system.  I think we would still  have to show lack of market power in order to do this.  Do you agree?  Stojic  warns that proving lack of market power is a lengthy and expensive  proposition.  Might be worth it to us, though.  Another idea is to somehow provide shippers with an incentive to pay more  than max rate.  After all, we do have authority to charge negotiated rates.   We've seen one instance in which one of our marketers was able to get more  than max rates for IT space based on good customer relations alone.  However,  despite our wonderful relationships with most of our customers, it's unlikely  we can pull this off with any consistency.  We wondered whether we might be  able to get more than max rates in the context of an auction procedure.  But  I just am not convinced we could get around the Commission's requirement that  recourse rates be available.  That requirement has not changed.  Have either  of you seen anything to the contrary?    I would like to meet with you two, plus several others I have in mind, to  discuss this, preferably early this week (Tues. or Wed.), but would like to  discuss briefly with you first.

If you guys are interested in doing this, I think our  next step is to give Citizens a ballpark estimate of what we would charge to  operate their Griffith system.  We can ""hedge"" our proposal based on the need  to see the installed equipment specs and/or what other equipment might be  necessary to integrate these facilities into our operations.  I'm awaiting  word from legal/regulatory to see what their issues might be.

If it's decided that we will do this  there might be some additional equipment needed. We can get an operating cost  together if you would like.

One of their  principal assets, Louisiana Gas Service (LGS) is one of those companies  recently sold by Citizens.  LGS provided gas control and operations services  to other non-LGS companies, including the Citizens Utilities LDC assets in  Arizona.  With the consummation of the sale of LGS, Citizens has told me  confidentially that they have no reasonable way of operating the  interconnect, metering and 1.5 mile lateral pipeline facilities that  interconnects TW and EPNG to the recently constructed Griffith Energy Power  Plant.   Therefore, Citizens is looking to possibly have a 3rd party provide  contract operations services under an operating agreement.  TW has been asked  in writing by Citizens to consider making a proposal to operate these  facilities.   Does TW have an interest in providing contract operations services for  Citizens?  In a related legal/regulatory question, does TW have the authority  to conduct contract services on behalf of others, or would we have to perform  these services as a separate legal entity?  If we do, does this present an  affiliate problem for us if we ""share"" operating employees?  If these  threshold questions can be accommodated, and TW is not only able to provide  contract operations services for Citizens, but has a commercial desire to do  so, what would we charge Citizens for this service?  Although it would appear  at first blush to be a relatively simple matter to operate these facilities,  remember that Citizens will be receiving gas (potentially) from both TW and  EPNG simultaneously, presenting not only a challenge to balance pressure  between the pipes, but to account for and reconcile deliveries and receipts  from both pipes as well as the plant site.   Although I'm the principal commercial representative for Citizens as regards  transportation matters, I'm certainly willing to step out of the middle of  this negotiation if Operations desires to handle it themselves.  I will be  happy to provide you a copy of the brief 1/2 page letter Citizens sent to me  on the 17th soliciting TW's interest.   Given the relatively short lead time  until LGS operations is sold, Citizens has requested expedited  consideration.  Please let me know how you want to proceed.  Call if you have  any questions.          ",mary.miller@enron.com,susan.scott@enron.com,Citizens request for proposal,2000-11-28 00:41:00-08:00,sent

"Okay, so here's the debate...There's a flight out Friday night leaving  Houston at 11:00 pm and getting into SD around 2:20 in the morning.  The next  earlier flight leaves Houston around 5:30 pm but unfortunately there's no way  I could make that one because of  work.  The other option is to fly in  Saturday morning like I did last time.  I'm leaning towards leaving Friday  night and just taking a cab to your place as long as you don't mind waking up  to let me in.  That way we'd have all day Saturday to do things and I  wouldn't leave on Sunday until around 3:30 (or I could even leave around  6:00).

Susan and I spoke with Jeff Dasovich and Mark= =20 Baldwin yesterday, and the consensus of those conversations was that=20 Transwestern should remain involved in this proceeding only for purposes of= =20 implementation/documentation.  Jeff offered that he might send a letter to= =20 Governor Gray's office expressing both dismay and indignation that the CPUC= =20 didn't complete their task and warning of the adverse outcome to California= =20 ratepayers if these more modest reforms are approved.  He may ask the other= =20 Comprehensive Settlement parties to join in signing the letter.  Susan, Mar= k=20 and I spoke about this idea later, and we've got some reservations about TW= 's=20 role in admonishing the CPUC.   We should probably wait to see this letter= =20 first before committing to anything.  Bilas draft cautious toward SoCal competition Mindful of the current chaos over energy markets in the state, California= =20 Public Utilities Commissioner Richard Bilas has recommended the adoption of a much more=20 moderate approach to promoting competition on Southern California Gas=01, (SoCal) sy= stem. In his draft decision, Bilas advised the commission to reject the unbundlin= g=20 of intrastate transmission and instead approve the first settlement filed in the case, th= e=20 less far-reaching Interim Settlement (IS), submitted in December 1999. SoCal, San Diego Gas a= nd=20 Electric and other parties filed two more settlements after the IS, reaching a=20 comprehensive agreement in April this year.  But since then, gas and power prices skyrocketed in the state, prompting a= =20 consumer backlash and giving competition a bad name.  The draft language notes that= =20 the first interim settlement was supported by more customer groups than the later agreements. Recent events =01&lead us to conclude that the centerpiece of this=20 investigation, the unbundling of intrastate transmission and the implementation of a system of firm,=20 tradable intrastate transmission rights, should be delayed,=018 according t= o the=20 draft order.  =01&This unbundling is the basis of the [comprehensive settle= ment]=20 and we cannot approve it. We do not, however, wish to commit to paralysis= =20 until 2006, as the [post-interim settlement] would have us do. Accordingly,= =20 we believe Californians are better served at this juncture by the adoption,= =20 with modifications, of the IS.=018  The biggest change to the IS in the draft is the rejection of an automatic= =20 capacity expansion by SoCal at Wheeler Ridge, Calif., with rolled-in rates if certain criteria= =20 are met.  El Paso Energy had objected to the provision in the IS that would have allowed SoCa= l=20 to automatically expand capacity at Wheeler Ridge by 100 million cfd if a certain number of= =20 curtailments oc-curred. =20 El Paso objected to forcing all shippers to pay for the expansion at Wheele= r=20 when only certain customers would benefit. =20 The draft says SoCal can file a separate application for the Wheeler Ridge= =20 expansion, but approval would be conditioned on a traditional hearing proce= ss.  The draft decision would also: =01=07 End SoCal=01,s current =01&windowing=018 process, which limits shipp= ers=01, ability to=20 change nominations for deliveries between receipt points on the system. It is replaced with an= =20 announced daily calculation of capacity available at each receipt point; =01=07 Establish Hector Road as a formal receipt point for nominations; =01=07 Institute an operational flow order (OFO) procedure. Provides a foru= m for=20 more changes in OFO procedures if excessive OFOs are made; =01=07 Set up =01&pools=018 of gas on the SoCal transmission system that ar= e intended to=20 increase the liquidity of gas trading; =01=07 Make changes to balancing rules, while retaining the current 10% mon= thly=20 imbalance tolerance; =01=07 Make SoCal=01,s own gas acquisition unit subject to the same balanci= ng rules=20 and penalties as all other shippers; =01=07 Allow some limited imbalances trading, as well as the right to assig= n and=20 reassign unbundled storage contract in a secondary market, with a SoCal electronic bulletin=20 board set up for it; =01=07 Unbundle from core transportation rates the storage capacity cost ex= ceeding=20 that required for core minimum reliability; and =01=07 Provide for rate recovery of up to $3.5 million in implementation co= sts.  In addition, the draft would unbundle core interstate transportation from= =20 rates, eliminate core contribution to noncore interstate transition cost surcharges, elimina= te=20 the core subscription option as well as the caps for core aggregation programs.  The threshold fo= r=20 participating in core aggregation is reduced, and billing options are offered to core=20 aggregators.  Bilas=01, draft also warned that the commission may come back in two years = to=20 open another investigation into gas competition, taking into account any changes in mark= et=20 conditions. Bilas gave a little more insight into his decision in the text of the draft= . =01&The cost of gas as a commodity has vastly increased at the border, show= ing a=20 differential between the basin and border prices that is more than the cost of transport= =20 and related services; we question whether there will be an opportunity for discounting by markete= rs=20 if more competition is allowed,=018=20 Bilas wrote in the draft decision.  =01&With half the state already committ= ed to=20 a restructured competitive natural gas industry, it suddenly seems as if the= =20 benefits of such re- structuring to enhance competition are speculative, particularly at this=20 time.

Susan and I spoke with Jeff Dasovich and Mark= =20 Baldwin yesterday, and the consensus of those conversations was that=20 Transwestern should remain involved in this proceeding only for purposes of= =20 implementation/documentation.  Jeff offered that he might send a letter to= =20 Governor Gray's office expressing both dismay and indignation that the CPUC= =20 didn't complete their task and warning of the adverse outcome to California= =20 ratepayers if these more modest reforms are approved.  He may ask the other= =20 Comprehensive Settlement parties to join in signing the letter.  Susan, Mar= k=20 and I spoke about this idea later, and we've got some reservations about TW= 's=20 role in admonishing the CPUC.   We should probably wait to see this letter= =20 first before committing to anything.  Bilas draft cautious toward SoCal competition Mindful of the current chaos over energy markets in the state, California= =20 Public Utilities Commissioner Richard Bilas has recommended the adoption of a much more=20 moderate approach to promoting competition on Southern California Gas=01, (SoCal) sy= stem. In his draft decision, Bilas advised the commission to reject the unbundlin= g=20 of intrastate transmission and instead approve the first settlement filed in the case, th= e=20 less far-reaching Interim Settlement (IS), submitted in December 1999. SoCal, San Diego Gas a= nd=20 Electric and other parties filed two more settlements after the IS, reaching a=20 comprehensive agreement in April this year.  But since then, gas and power prices skyrocketed in the state, prompting a= =20 consumer backlash and giving competition a bad name.  The draft language notes that= =20 the first interim settlement was supported by more customer groups than the later agreements. Recent events =01&lead us to conclude that the centerpiece of this=20 investigation, the unbundling of intrastate transmission and the implementation of a system of firm,=20 tradable intrastate transmission rights, should be delayed,=018 according t= o the=20 draft order.  =01&This unbundling is the basis of the [comprehensive settle= ment]=20 and we cannot approve it. We do not, however, wish to commit to paralysis= =20 until 2006, as the [post-interim settlement] would have us do. Accordingly,= =20 we believe Californians are better served at this juncture by the adoption,= =20 with modifications, of the IS.=018  The biggest change to the IS in the draft is the rejection of an automatic= =20 capacity expansion by SoCal at Wheeler Ridge, Calif., with rolled-in rates if certain criteria= =20 are met.  El Paso Energy had objected to the provision in the IS that would have allowed SoCa= l=20 to automatically expand capacity at Wheeler Ridge by 100 million cfd if a certain number of= =20 curtailments oc-curred. =20 El Paso objected to forcing all shippers to pay for the expansion at Wheele= r=20 when only certain customers would benefit. =20 The draft says SoCal can file a separate application for the Wheeler Ridge= =20 expansion, but approval would be conditioned on a traditional hearing proce= ss.  The draft decision would also: =01=07 End SoCal=01,s current =01&windowing=018 process, which limits shipp= ers=01, ability to=20 change nominations for deliveries between receipt points on the system. It is replaced with an= =20 announced daily calculation of capacity available at each receipt point; =01=07 Establish Hector Road as a formal receipt point for nominations; =01=07 Institute an operational flow order (OFO) procedure. Provides a foru= m for=20 more changes in OFO procedures if excessive OFOs are made; =01=07 Set up =01&pools=018 of gas on the SoCal transmission system that ar= e intended to=20 increase the liquidity of gas trading; =01=07 Make changes to balancing rules, while retaining the current 10% mon= thly=20 imbalance tolerance; =01=07 Make SoCal=01,s own gas acquisition unit subject to the same balanci= ng rules=20 and penalties as all other shippers; =01=07 Allow some limited imbalances trading, as well as the right to assig= n and=20 reassign unbundled storage contract in a secondary market, with a SoCal electronic bulletin=20 board set up for it; =01=07 Unbundle from core transportation rates the storage capacity cost ex= ceeding=20 that required for core minimum reliability; and =01=07 Provide for rate recovery of up to $3.5 million in implementation co= sts.  In addition, the draft would unbundle core interstate transportation from= =20 rates, eliminate core contribution to noncore interstate transition cost surcharges, elimina= te=20 the core subscription option as well as the caps for core aggregation programs.  The threshold fo= r=20 participating in core aggregation is reduced, and billing options are offered to core=20 aggregators.  Bilas=01, draft also warned that the commission may come back in two years = to=20 open another investigation into gas competition, taking into account any changes in mark= et=20 conditions. Bilas gave a little more insight into his decision in the text of the draft= . =01&The cost of gas as a commodity has vastly increased at the border, show= ing a=20 differential between the basin and border prices that is more than the cost of transport= =20 and related services; we question whether there will be an opportunity for discounting by markete= rs=20 if more competition is allowed,=018=20 Bilas wrote in the draft decision.  =01&With half the state already committ= ed to=20 a restructured competitive natural gas industry, it suddenly seems as if the= =20 benefits of such re- structuring to enhance competition are speculative, particularly at this=20 time.  With one leg in the water, the current has switched direction and it will be difficult, if not= =20 foolhardy, to reach our goals by forging ahead.  =01&We choose to take a cautious approach again,=018 the draft continues. = =01&Rather=20 than proceeding to unbundle transmission in Southern California now, we approve, with=20 modifications, the settle- ment suggesting smaller steps towards a competitive market. Additionally, w= e=20 unbundle core interstate transmission and once again urge the Legislature to pass consume= r=20 protection legisla- tion aimed at unregulated marketers while we facilitate growth in core=20 aggregation programs.=018 The CPUC would not rule out the unbundling of intrastate transmission and= =20 other restruc- turing in the future =01&but believe that at this point in time the certain= =20 benefits do not outweigh the costs to most ratepayers.=018  All drafts must be filed 30 days before the meetings at which they will be= =20 discussed.

The following is a very brief outline of what would be required to prove la= ck=20 of market power.  A warning:  lack of market power is very difficult to=20 prove.  Koch, a pipeline that most in the industry would agree does lack=20 market power, tried and failed.  The deck is already stacked against us in= =20 TW's case given the withholding of capacity by El Paso's affiliate and the= =20 price conditions in California.  However, we do need to analyze the=20 possibilities for TW, if not to the Cal. border, then on other parts of our= =20 system.  Additionally, we need to discuss acceptable incentives for shipper= s=20 to pay negotiated rates if we do not end up changing our tariff.  Would you be availabile on Tuesday to discuss this?  Please let me know.  I= n=20 the meantime, here is a summary of FERC's policy on market based rates.  ***  To obtain authority to charge market based rates, TW would first have to=20 request a declaratory order, and in its application provide information=20 showing it meets the requirements outlined below.  If the Commission finds= =20 all requirements have been met, it will issue an order and TW would then ma= ke=20 the appropriate tariff filing to put market based rates into effect. =20 Application for declaratory order must include:  1.  Detailed description of the services proposed for market-based rate=20 treatment.  I assume in our case it would be firm transportation service.  2.  A statement defining the relevant product and geographic markets=20 necessary for establishing the applicant lacks market power with respect to= =20 the services at issue.  The Commission requires a narrow definition of the= =20 market=01(""firm transportation"" is probably narrow enough, but for our purp= oses=20 we might want to narrow it down more (i.e., firm transportation East of=20 Thoreau).  We have to define substitute services available to shippers=01(o= ther=20 pipelines are a ""good substitute"" only if shippers can obtain the same=20 quality of service on a timely basis, and if the other pipelines offer such= =20 service at a price that would deter TW from raising its prices more than=20 10%.  All relevant ""origin markets"" must be defined (Panhandle; West Texas)= =20 as well as ""destination markets,"" and alternatives for shippers in those=20 markets identified.  Transportation alternatives are only good alternatives= =20 if they provide a netback to shippers that is roughly the same as if they= =20 used TW.  Note that the Commission has rejected capacity release as a good= =20 alternative since it does not guarantee a shipper its desired contract=20 quantity.  3.  Market share and HHI calculations; discussion of other relevant=20 competitive factors.  Commission looks at size of market share, mitigating= =20 factors such as ease of entry, and market concentration as measured by HHI.=  =20 Market concentration has to be calculated for each relevant receipt point a= nd=20 delivery point.

Vittorio Mincato, Eni's chief executive, confirmed that the group is on the verge of finalizi= ng the sale of its Immobiliare Metanopoli property subsidiary (Eni's real estate company) with assets valued between $856 million and $1.3 billion. Eni's decision to divest its property assets has been viewed by many observ= ers of the company as an attempt to release funds to facilitate a merger with another company. Enron Corp. has been among those on a rumored short list of merger prospects for Eni.  ANALYSIS: Is the foundation being established for a mega-merger between Eni and Enron? It is not too difficult to formulate a theoretical argument in that direction.  Eni is Italy's state-owned, multi-faceted energy company, operating in the oil and gas, power generation, petrochemicals, oilfield services, and engineering industries. The company has a market capitalization of about 47 billion euros (approximately $40 billion), is present in over 70 countri= es and produces more than one million barrels of oil equivalent a day. Across the European energy market=01*which once it has fully privatized will repre= sent an arguably larger market than the United States=01*Eni is unquestionably one of the Continent's leading champions.  Illustrating this point, Eni has taken several important steps within Europ= e to, as it says, ""play an increasingly important role"" in the Continent's competitive energy market. For instance, earlier this month, Eni inked a deal to sell 2 billion cubic meters of natural gas to Gaz de France. This deal followed a previous agreement in which Eni agreed to sell 4 billi= on cubic meters of natural gas to Italy's largest private energy supplier, Edison. With both agreements, Eni has given a substantial kick start to the opening of the European natural-gas market. CEO Mincato has said that Eni would recoup the losses made by giving up its market hold in Italy by ""focusing on international markets.""  One move that Eni has made outside of Europe also came earlier this month. Eni made a bid for Australia's Petroz NL, which wields an 8.25 percent stake in Bayu-Undan, the giant gas and liquids project located off the northern coast of Australia. Eni already owns 6.7 percent of Bayu-Undan and apparently is attempting to gain a majority ownership over the project. It is no wonder why=01*the Bayu-Undan field has recoverable reserves of 400 million barrels of liquefied petroleum gas and gas reserves of 3.4 trillion cubic feet. Petroz has not yet accepted Eni's offer, but a favorable decisi= on is expected shortly. Thus, whatever Eni may be divesting in Italy it is trying to regain in other key areas of the world. In fact, Mincato recently confirmed that Eni plans to increase its daily output of oil from a current level of 1.2 million barrels to 1.5 million barrels by 2003.  Moreover, Eni has been making aggressive attempts at expansion, both within Europe and beyond. Along with that expansion comes the development of merge= r strategy. Eni does not want to be left as a target for a takeover, which could be a strong possibility given its recent divestitures and the fact that its profits remain strong. Net income for the company for the first half of 2000 was 2,606 millions of euros (equivalent to approximately $2.2 billion), representing a 119-percent increase. Eni is largely considered one of the best buys among the big oil stocks, but it would rather merge with an equal partner than be sold to another company. As consolidation of the oil industry continues, Eni reportedly believes that the only way to remain a top player is to marry an equally large player on the world stage.  Enron may be at the top of Eni's list of merger partners. Negotiations with Spain's largest oil company, Repsol, appear to have stalled, as was confirmed when Mincato stated that any ""link-up with Repsol would not be a merger of equals."" French oil company TotalFina is also interested, but is preoccupied with its own acquisition of fellow French oil company Elf. Other companies that have been mentioned include Conoco and Phillips=20 Petroleum. It is quite obvious that Eni's merger prospects are predominantly oil=20 companies, which is quite clearly the company's intention. Thus, it may seem odd that Enron is also included as a top prospect. Enron, while unquestionably a world player, is known for its unorthodox approach to hard assets. Put succinctly, Enron believes that it doesn't need to own physical assets in order to be a major player, but rather it only needs to rely on strategi= c contractual agreements.  However, if Eni wants to continue to expand globally, it arguably could not find a better partner than Enron, generally considered North America's biggest buyer and seller of electricity and natural gas. Enron's gas tradin= g and distribution activities in particular=01*along with its electricity=20 production, raw material trading and broadband expansion=01*would all appear to be good compliments to Eni's portfolio. Reports of talks between the two companies first appeared in the Italian financial paper iL Sole 24 Ore, based on input from an unnamed source. The report indicated that Enron is being targeted by Eni for an equity partnership or even a full merger. Mincato, as recently as Tuesday of this week, continues to adamantly deny that any deal with Enron is being studied.  Not surprisingly, Enron is remaining mum on the rumors and has not even mentioned Eni in any recent disclosures. However, the incorporation of Eni's power production portfolio would support Enron's expansion into new markets such as Japan, for example. Back in March, the Japanese government began allowing non-utility firms to supply power to industrial and commerci= al end-users. Almost simultaneously, Enron established a new subsidiary, Enron Japan Corp., to capitalize on new opportunities in the country. Enron Japan= 's first offer is a 10-percent discount off current electricity prices for customers who sign on with Enron for two to four years. Operating against its North American strategy, Enron also plans to build a power station in northern Japan, beating to the punch several of its key rivals, includin= g Vivendi, Texaco and Royal Dutch Shell, which also have expressed interest in establishing operations in the country.  Enron's proposed power plant should give the company prime access to compan= ies in the Tohoku and Kanto regions, as well as Tokyo, the ""big catch"" of the Japanese market. In my opinion, herein lies the primary synergy that would make the partnership between Eni and Enron a strategic step for both=20 companies. As Eni attempts to position itself in various key markets, Japan seems like a natural location, and I've seen no reports that indicate Eni is moving into Japan on its own. The fact that Enron is already there, along with most other lucrative international markets, must certainly be appealin= g to Eni. Regarding Enron's perspective on any potential partnering, Eni's substantial oil and natural-gas generation assets, along with its current lock on the European market, must be very attractive.  Enron's current market capitalization is about $48 billion, which actually makes it larger than Eni. This raises the question of which company would be the buying partner if a merger were to indeed take place. All of the rumors flying around currently speak of Eni pursuing Enron, but it could just as easily be the other way around. Those of us who follow Enron closel= y may find it hard to believe that the powerhouse company would ever be the target for a takeover or even a merger. In any case, the rumors continue to fly as Eni responds to claims of ""thou doth protest too much."" Whether or not any such merger between Eni and Enron, which appears smart on paper, will materialize remains to be seen. However, it certainly seems like Eni is lining up its chess pieces to cement some kind of partnership in the very near future. =3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D= =3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D= =3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D SCIENTECH can help you find the answers you need.

Since it will be a manual process, can you keep an LFT waiver log/book that  is at a LE level, then place a copy of this signed overrun request form in  each LFT contract file & change the flag to Yes on each active LFT contract  for that shipper? Item 2. Can they change their mind on the waiver-if so would this require an  amendment to the contract? Answer - Yes they can change, so the field needs  to be date effective, but would like it to be an administrative amendment  with new request form signed by the shipper ( not an amendment through the  contract). This would be a change for all their LFT contracts since marketing  wants to keep it simple at an LE Shipper Level. Item 3. Can the waiver be date sensitive? Answer -  Yes, Susan Scott will  review the request form and make any changes needed. I will forward a copy of  the draft I did to you and marketing and Susan to review. Item 4. Is the contracts group suppose to be the keeper of the waiver? Answer  - Yes, Marketing suggested that a LFT Waiver book be set up, then also they  would like a copy of the signed request form to be in each LFT contract file. Item 5. When is the shipper suppose to submit the waiver - at request time?  Answer - Yes at the time they are executing their first LFT contract. When we  have the system changes in production, I will let marketing know, & they will  advise the shippers of this new waiver. Item 6. Where will the waiver reside? With the request, on the Web under  blank forms? Answer - Yes, on the web, under Contracts-blank forms for  TW.   Please let me know if you have any other issues.

The system should default to no waiver which means the LFT shipper  would be scheduled to zero when we call an LFT day at their point. If we have  the waiver, then the flag will be set to yes. During scheduling we will  schedule their LFT as overrun if capacity at the point was available. I do  not have a draft waiver form, but I can get a copy of one that NNG uses.  You  may want to address these issues from Linda. See her questions below.

No longer  pertains to NNG -   I am familiar with this issue.  The situation was  described to me as follows:   Shipper has a standing nom for a month.  i.e.    a firm 100/day at a receipt point.  sometime during the month we call a LFT  day at the receipt point,  the nom would automatically become an  interruptible nom for the LFT which may or may not be scheduled,  but the key  is that the Shipper does not have to watch the notice and make a specific  nom.

"Hey Bronwyn,  I just realized I never emailed you back ( I am a bad, bad person).  Glad to  hear things are going well with you.  It was so neat to run into you in  Houston, I see your brother around the building quite a bit but I don't think  he recognizes me.  I'll have to make a point to reintroduce myself the next  time I see him.    So what's new with you?  Have you moved?  I know you were thinking about LA a  while back...I've got a couple of friends from high school who are living out  there and are really having a good time.  Anyway, I completely understand the  urge to try something new.  I too am thinking of making a move before next  summer ( I don't know exactly where, but somewhere outside of Texas...I  really need to experience something different).  Speaking of which, Emily is  in London going to graduate school right now.  I've already been to visit her  once there and she's trying to talk me into moving over there.  I would  actually love to go, if there was a job with Enron there that interested me.    As for my dating life, it is relatively unchanged.  I was seeing one guy for  a while, really liked him, things were going great ( I thought )...then he  seemed to loose interest and decided 2 mos. into things to tell me he has  issues and that he'd been married before.  Needless to say, that was pretty  much the end of things.  It's made me a little hesitant when it comes to  meeting new guys, but at the same time I had so much fun in the beginning  that I'm still optimistic about my dating future.  How about you?  Concerning Kappa...I'll give you a run down on everyone I still keep in touch  with.  Corey's in Law School at Texas ( doing great of course) and has  already secured a clerkship with a federal judge in Galveston when she  graduates.  Jessica Bateman is now Jessica Pulliam - and she too is in Law  School at Texas and has secured a federal clerkship with a judge in Dallas  when she graduates.  Elizabeth's is in Med School in San Antonio and dating a  fellow med student there.  Stephanie Spence is now Stephanie Williams and is  living and working in Dallas.  Lisa Meador is getting married next April to a  guy from Texas ( he was a KA, there Brad Thealman (sp?) ) who is absolutely  perfect for her.  That about sums it up, but if there's anyone else you're  wondering about just ask...I can probably find out some scoop.  Talk to you soon, Susan           Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp.

I have the flexibility with my job to live wherever I choose, so I've  been thinking about LA.  I'm torn though b/c I like Houston, too.

"As it appears I will be living and breathing the 32nd floor of the Enron  building well through the first of the year, I've decided to break down and  try to maintain my friendships via email.  You all know me well enough to  know that this a huge step on my part ( I am not the world's best emailer).   Anyway, I feel like I'm out of touch with what's going on in your collective  lives and am thus missing out on some pretty wonderful, exciting and special  things.  So when and if any of you get a chance shoot me back a quick note  and let me know what's new in your life.  Love you guys, Susan  Jennifer - Hope work is going well.  I know this time of year has got to be  crazy for anyone in your line of work, but I'm sure you're handling it well.   We really need to go grab coffee, dinner, a movie or something soon.  I'm in  need of a good chat.  Jessica - I know you're in the midst of finals right now and probably about  to pull your hair out.  Just focus on the fact that they'll be over soon and  you'll be off to London to see Ashley and Lee ( I am so jealous).  Please  tell Clay I say hello and wish him good luck as well on y'alls exams.  Lisa - Hey sweetie!  I am so sorry I couldn't make it to your shower in SA,  but Jen said it went really well.  We need to get together soon I've missed  seeing you and especially hearing about the wedding and all the fun goings  ons in your life.  Tell Brad I say ""Hi"" and I'll be glued to the TV set just  like him on the on the 29th rooting on the Horns.  Emily - I really want to hear how your Thanksgiving went with Thomas and the  ""Fam"".  Knowing Thomas it went great and your entire family (especially your  Mom) is absolutely in love with him.  Keep me posted on your plans for the  future ( I'm curious where you're going to end up geographically).  Also, I  thought you'd find it interesting that I may have an opportunity to work in  your old hometown - Chicago.  Any thoughts?  Elizabeth - I have really been out of touch with you and I am very mad at  myself for letting that happen.  Please write back soon and let me know how  school, your family and this new man in your life ( okay, I'm not completely  out of touch) are all doing.  My guess is you're going through exams as well  right now so I'll wish you the best of luck and infinite success.","jkbowles@hotmail.com, jespulliam@aol.com, lisa.a.meador@chase.com,   emily.boon@msdw.com, edrington@uthscsa.edu",susan.scott@enron.com,Hi girls...,2000-12-12 01:56:00-08:00,sent
"Contrary to popular belief I am alive...The 22nd works for me too (although  given my current work situation I'm sure I'd be late - better late than  never, right?)  Anyway, both of the current suggestions sound good ( I've  been to Benji's - great food and heard really good things about Ousie's table  as well).

So far it has been overwhelmingly positive!  I really can't wait to get us all together.  Emily had suggested Ousies's Table-as well as a coworker of mine.  Yesterday during our lunch break we went and looked at Ousies's and it seems pretty cute.  Unfortunately they were not open, but I heard they light it up at night and it is supposed to be really pretty.  The other suggestion is Benji's.  Lis-you made a good point.  It would be nice to try somewhere new. I have not heard from Sarah or Kelly-so if you talk to them-please pass them the message.  I know Kelly usually checks her email, but I am not sure about Sarah.  If anyone has a number for her-let me know.  I also haven't heard from Susan Scott-so Lisa- you are in charge of that. Ashley-I know you've gotten this message-so reply!  : ) Corinne-Sorry that you will not be able to make it. : (  If anything changes-let us know. Jen's flight comes in around 7 that night-so I thought we would make the reservations for 8-830 so she has time to make it.

Jeff, Lorraine and I just  learned that this is not the case.  Our ""generally available"" posting system  does not distinguish between capacity rolling off of a contract and capacity  that is subject to a ROFR; all it recognizes is the expiration of the initial  contract term.  Therefore, we have capacity posted on our website that is  subject to the current shipper's ROFR and that is therefore not really  available.  We found this out when a shipper called asking about some posted  space.  Jeff's initial reaction was ""no, that space isn't available.""  But  when we checked the posting, there it was.  The commercial people instantly  recognized it as space currently subject to a contract that contains a ROFR.    My recommendation is that we modify the posting procedure to NOT post  capacity until we know that capacity is unsubscribed after we jump thru all  the ROFR hoops.  The premature posting of that capacity is, at best,  confusing to our customers who might count on getting the space by bidding  maximum rate.  I realize that modifying our system might involve additional  time and cost, but I think it's misleading to leave it as is.  Please let me  know whether you concur.

From my perspective, TW needs an agreement because TW is uniquely situated.   Here's why.  - My understanding is that TW is the only pipeline that has been asked to pay  a fee.  - The developers Michelle Lokay and I have been talking to seem very  uncertain about exactly what the fee covers.  -  $50,000 is a lot of money to Transwestern.  -   Transwestern has a recent history of not getting what it thought it had  bargained for from affiliated companies, and would appreciate our trying to  protect them.  I am not trying to create extra work for anyone.  I am just a little confused  about why a contract for TW would necessitate a contract for the other 2  companies.  If you could help me understand, I would appreciate it.    If the consensus is that we feel strongly that TW should not have a written  agreement, then I would at least insist on a detailed letter of intent or  term sheet.  This would force both sides to think ahead about what is  expected.  (And, as a practical matter, it's highly unlikely that we're going  to take legal action for breach of contract against an affiliate...)  Thanks.

"Once Susan gets the last few pieces of info, either Steve or I should call  ECS and try to resolve this.  Steve--you or me??  Its your call.  DF     Susan Scott 01/21/2001 12:45 PM To: Kevin Hyatt/ET&S/Enron@Enron, James Centilli/ET&S/Enron@ENRON, Drew  Fossum@ENRON cc: Steven Harris/ET&S/Enron@ENRON   Subject: ECS Gallup contract  Here are some bullet points based on our conversation Friday morning  regarding the ECS Compression Service Agreement.  These bullet points  summarize our position and are intended to be a starting point for a  conversation between persons at TW and at ECS (who are yet to be determined)  regarding the additional power costs incurred by Transwestern as a result of  the lack of a system for monitoring peak loads on CDEC.  If you have  additional comments, please let me know.    We still need to decide who is going to call whom; I am going to leave that  up to you, but do let me know if I can help.   -  ECS is under an obligation to work in good faith with CDEC to establish a  monitoring system that would automatically  alert TW to peak loading conditions on CDEC's system.    -  Rate No. 21 became effective in July 2000.  ECS did not obtain permission  for TW to access the ""Members Only"" portion of CDEC's website (which contains  load data) until January 2001.  Access to the information required a  confidentiality agreement, which was executed in December.  -  ECS blames the delay on Tri-State/CDEC, who allegedly would not work on  the confidentiality agreement until the merger was completed.   ""Good faith""  by ECS would reasonably include alerting TW to any such delay or any  difficulty in getting access to CDEC's information.  TW was never contacted  in this regard.    -  Since Rate No. 21 contains a rebate for customers that avoid peak load  times, we assume that CDEC is under an obligation to provide such customers  with access to peak load information (I have not been able to verify this,  but it makes sense).  If this is true, we should have been able to have  access immediately upon the effectiveness of Rate No. 21.  -  Most if not all of the $325,000 peak load costs incurred by TW since July  could have been avoided had TW had access to a monitoring system.  Because it  did not alert TW to difficulties/delay in getting the necessary information  from CDEC, ECS did not act in good faith in obtaining such access and should  therefore take responsibility for its share of the consequences.  -  ECS needs to act without further delay to build an automated monitoring  system to eliminate the need for someone to continuously monitor the  website.  An estimated completion date should be provided.  I've left messages at CDEC to ask about access to the Members Only part of  the website; I'll follow up.  The website states only that access is granted  ""on a case-by-case basis.""  I hope to make contact on Monday and will let you  know what I'm able to learn from them.

My chief concern was the pre-637 contracts that are not in our transactional reports.  Most of the discount letters include confidentiality provisions and we're required to seek confidential treatment if required to disclose the contracts.  I was hoping to find that none of the information about these contracts had been disclosed in any public forum.  However, I think our shippers (and TW) would be hard-pressed to claim that the info FERC is requesting is confidential.  These shippers' names and contract rates are disclosed in our monthly discount reports to FERC.  (I assume we do not seek confidential treatment of these reports -- let me know if I'm mistaken.)   Quantities, expiration date and receipt and delivery points for these shippers' contracts appear on the Index of Customers on our website.

Assessing extreme penalties, as the OFO/EFOs would do, on users who  are not perfectly imbalance under this situation certainly seems unfair.   However, I think we should argue that limiting the payments to  shippers/customers whose gas is diverted to serve core customers to a market  index may not fully compensate for the diversion.

If you have  additional comments, please let me know.    We still need to decide who is going to call whom; I am going to leave that  up to you, but do let me know if I can help.   -  ECS is under an obligation to work in good faith with CDEC to establish a  monitoring system that would automatically  alert TW to peak loading conditions on CDEC's system.    -  Rate No. 21 became effective in July 2000.  ECS did not obtain permission  for TW to access the ""Members Only"" portion of CDEC's website (which contains  load data) until January 2001.  Access to the information required a  confidentiality agreement, which was executed in December.  -  ECS blames the delay on Tri-State/CDEC, who allegedly would not work on  the confidentiality agreement until the merger was completed.   ""Good faith""  by ECS would reasonably include alerting TW to any such delay or any  difficulty in getting access to CDEC's information.  TW was never contacted  in this regard.    -  Since Rate No. 21 contains a rebate for customers that avoid peak load  times, we assume that CDEC is under an obligation to provide such customers  with access to peak load information (I have not been able to verify this,  but it makes sense).  If this is true, we should have been able to have  access immediately upon the effectiveness of Rate No. 21.  -  Most if not all of the $325,000 peak load costs incurred by TW since July  could have been avoided had TW had access to a monitoring system.  Because it  did not alert TW to difficulties/delay in getting the necessary information  from CDEC, ECS did not act in good faith in obtaining such access and should  therefore take responsibility for its share of the consequences.  -  ECS needs to act without further delay to build an automated monitoring  system to eliminate the need for someone to continuously monitor the  website.  An estimated completion date should be provided.  I've left messages at CDEC to ask about access to the Members Only part of  the website; I'll follow up.

I think a simple checklist for the marketers, legal & reg. would help.   Here's what I suggest:  - Marketer:  Work with Susan on negotiated rate contract language.  E-mail  draft of contract to Glen, Mary, Susan, Mary Kay and Drew for information and  for sign-off by Legal and Regulatory prior to sending to the shipper.    - Mary and Susan -- have a telephone conversation to confirm that a filing  needs to be made, and if so when.  If a filing does not need to be made  immediately, note filing date on both Mary's and Susan's calendars (and on  Filing Log).  - Marketer:  Contract must be executed at least one day before gas flow.   Once contract is executed, immediately (1) fax it to Mary at 402-398-7006 and  (2) make sure the contract representative (Linda Trevino?) knows that it is a  negotiated rate deal and needs to be posted on the transactional report.  - Mary?  Susan?:  Contact Linda Trevino to let her know the negotiated rate  tariff page that should be reference on the transactional report.  -  Mary/Glen:  Draft negotiated rate filing and have Susan or Maria review.   Rate language in tariff should be identical to contract negotiated rate  language.  Send to D.C. for filing.  Let me know if I've left anything out, and I'll get this edited, spiffed up,  etc. and circulate it to the marketers so we can get through April and all  other future deals without a hitch.

Mr. Cooper  indicated that he's been in contact with Lorraine for purposes of acquiring  Red Rock expansion capacity.  Moreover, Mr. Cooper has been in contact with  SoCal Gas in order that SoCal Gas recognize firm deliveries from Transwestern  at Needles in excess of the current (sustainable) limit of 750 MMcf/d.   Mr. Cooper insists that he is making progress with SoCal Gas aimed at lifting  the 750 window to 760, and that SoCal Gas has indicated U.S. Gypsum would be  entitled to an exclusive right to the increased amount.   While trying not to  be argumentative, I told Mr. Cooper that if SoCal Gas was willing to set  aside a discrete increment of capacity for a single shipper, it would be a  radical departure from current SoCal Gas policy.  Currently, SoCal Gas does  not provide unbundled intrastate transmission.  They have only accepted or  not accepted pipeline nominations, as the case may be, as an aggregate  volume, with no distinction being drawn on who the upstream shippers were.  I set about to try to explain that there is no correlation (other than  coincidental timing) between (1) TW discussions with SoCal Gas at raising the  capacity window at Needles and (2) TW's effort to sell Red Rock Expansion  space.  In addition, I attempted to explain that TW feels it will be required  to follow certain rules pursuant to its tariff and FERC policy associated  with making new delivery point capacity available on a non-discriminatory  basis.  With respect to this issue, I told Mr. Cooper that, although we're  currently discussing it, we'd yet to come to any decision on how, if  incremental capacity does become available at Needles, TW would make such  delivery point capacity available to its shippers.    Mr. Cooper then proceeded to launch into a diatribe about how, if that's the  case, then ""he's wasted 3 weeks in active negotiations"" with both SoCal Gas  and TW aimed at securing capacity at Needles.  He said on several occasions  that ""end game"" for him was to secure a firm portal from the interstate  system onto and through the SoCal Gas system.  Mr. Cooper also expressed a  concern that if he's forced into a competitive bidding situation with other  big marketing companies (in his words, ""such as ENA"") for Needles capacity,  then he probably couldn't compete, and once again, would be left on the  outside looking in.  He pointed to the El Paso Merchant deal on EPNG as a  prime example.    Mr. Cooper said he wasn't ready to accept my explanation as to why TW  couldn't commit to offering U.S. Gypsum an exclusive right to any incremental  Needles capacity, and asked that I formally ""run it up the flagpole"" to  senior management and get back with him by telephone with TW's ""official  position.""   As an editorial comment, I'm not sure Mr. Cooper completely  understands (or cares about) the landscape here.  I'd go so far as to say  that from his style and the tone of his conversation with me, he won't easily  take ""no"" or even a ""maybe"" as an answer.   The difficulty for TW is going to  be in trying to persuade him that we're interested in his business and  sympathize with his position, but that we face real legal and/or regulatory  issues here, and they cannot be dismissed or ignored by U.S. Gypsum or any  other customer.  I'd like to be in a position to call him back on Friday and give him TW's  ""official position"" on his request for Needles service in the Red Rock  expansion.  Thoughts?  Suggestions?  Help?

If I understand correctly our posting period for this capacity expires on Monday at 5 p.m. You should accumulate service requests for the capacity until that time.  Tie bids will be decided by a lottery. If shippers ask you can explain to them that since this is newly posted capacity, we're posting it until 5 p.m. Monday and will not award capacity until that time, and if requests for service exceed available capacity we'll award it based on the procedures in Section 13 of the FTS-1 Rate Schedule.     -----Original Message----- From:  Miller, Mary Kay   Sent: Tuesday, March 20, 2001 5:55 PM To: Scott, Susan Cc: Fossum, Drew; Pavlou, Maria; Huber, Lee; Lokay, Michelle; Hyatt, Kevin; Fawcett, Jeffery; Hass, Glen; Darveaux, Mary Subject: RE: TW posting question -- URGENT  Per our previous decisions, we have utilized the provisions of section 13 for purposes of allocating capacity.

Without any parameters, we're better off sticking as close to the tariff allocation mechanism as possible.

Allocating the capacity on a FCFS basis is contrary to the open season concept.

OPPEL Jr. and LOWELL BERGMAN  03/26/2001 The New York Times Page 1, Column 4 c. 2001 New York Times Company  Early last year, the El Paso Natural Gas Company took bids from two dozen companies for the right to ship enough natural gas through its pipeline from Texas and New Mexico to meet one-sixth of the daily demand of energy-starved California.  The winner: El Paso's sister company, the El Paso Merchant Energy Company, which buys, sells and trades natural gas. The bidding was not close. El Paso Merchant offered twice as much for the capacity as the other companies bid, in total, for bits and pieces. Why pay so much more? California officials, who are pressing a complaint against El Paso at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, say the answer is simple. The state contends that El Paso Merchant, with help from its sister company, saw the transaction as a way to manipulate the price of natural gas by using its control of pipeline capacity.  According to sealed documents obtained by The New York Times that are part of filings in the federal case, executives at El Paso Merchant said internally that the deal would give them ''more control'' of gas markets, including the ''ability to influence the physical market'' to benefit the company's financial positions.  El Paso executives called the accusations fanciful, and in a formal response to California's complaint, said the state ''grossly distorted'' company documents by quoting words and phrases out of context.  The dispute opens a window on an important debate about oversight of the natural gas industry, which fuels a growing share of the nation's electric power plants.  At issue is whether current safeguards do enough to prevent anticompetitive abuses in the marketing and trading of natural gas, and whether federal regulators adequately enforce existing rules. In particular, many industry officials question whether regulated pipeline companies are able to favor unregulated sister companies that trade natural gas and are free to maximize profits.  More than 200,000 miles of interstate pipelines crisscross the country, moving natural gas from Canada, the Southwest and other producing regions to fuel factories, power utilities and heat houses.  Not long ago, many parts of the country had excess pipeline capacity. But experts say that several regions, including California, New York and New England, now face constraints as demand soars for gas to fuel power plants.  In California, state officials and utility executives said the documents in the federal case, and El Paso's actions, were proof that the state's energy crisis stemmed not just from an ill-conceived deregulation plan but from price manipulation and profiteering.  ''They are the market maker with this pipeline,'' said Loretta Lynch, the president of the California Public Utilities Commission, which has struggled to cope with skyrocketing power prices and supply shortages.  El Paso ''sets the price in California,'' Ms. Lynch said, and what it did was intentional. ''It has affected the price,'' she said, ''for everything related to heat and electrical power prices in the state.''  California's complaint to the federal agency contends that El Paso Merchant ''has hoarded capacity and refused to attractively price unused capacity'' on the pipeline. The state also charges that El Paso Natural Gas, the pipeline's owner, has had no incentive to spur competition, by offering discounts to other users, because the two companies are corporate siblings. The state said that El Paso had violated federal natural gas statutes that prohibit anticompetitive behavior.  The sealed filings in the El Paso case indicated that the company expected to make money by widening the ''basis spread'' -- the difference between what gas can be bought for in producing basins of Texas and New Mexico, at one end of the pipeline, and its price on delivery to Southern California.  As it turned out, spreads widened enormously over the last year as the price of gas soared in California, adding to costs for wholesale electricity that pushed the biggest utilities near bankruptcy. California utilities paid $6.2 billion above competitive prices for wholesale electricity over the last 10 months, state officials estimated. The utilities are not allowed to recoup the costs from customers. While the cost of 1,000 cubic feet of gas typically is less than $1 higher at the California end of the pipeline, spot prices in the state rose to almost $50 more than the Texas-New Mexico price in December.  To executives of the parent company, the El Paso Corporation, the accusations of market manipulation are ludicrous.  High gas prices in California, El Paso executives said in interviews, are easily explained by soaring demand, the poor credit standing of the state's utilities and the failure of the utilities to retain pipeline capacity or store enough gas for winter.  ''The idea that anybody is holding back on California is really ridiculous,'' said Clark C. Smith, president of El Paso Merchant's operations in North America.  Some El Paso customers, though, agreed with California officials. The Pacific Gas & Electric Company, the San Francisco-based utility, condemned El Paso in a filing with the federal agency after its lawyers reviewed the sealed company documents.  ''It is now very clear from the business records of El Paso Energy Corporation,'' the utility said in the filing, ''that the business strategy El Paso Merchant was authorized at the highest corporate levels to pursue involved manipulation of price spreads.''  The agency has not ruled on California's complaint, which asks that the deal between El Paso Natural Gas and El Paso Merchant be invalidated. Based on the agency's history of policing energy providers lightly, many industry observers predicted that the complaint would be dismissed, perhaps as soon as the agency's public meeting on Wednesday.  Nonetheless, El Paso Merchant is feeling some pressure. The subsidiary said recently that it planned to relinquish control of all but about 22 percent of the capacity on the pipeline to California, rather than exercise an option that would have allowed it to retain the entire capacity of 1.2 billion cubic feet of gas a day.  Critics said they believed El Paso made the move in hopes of lessening the chance of government action. El Paso executives deny that but do say that their decision was influenced by the backlash over the arrangement.  Surrendering the pipeline capacity made for a ''gut-wrenching'' decision, Mr. Smith said, but was ''a first-class gesture'' to California. El Paso Merchant paid $38.5 million to control the pipeline capacity from March 1, 2000, until May 31, 2001. While Mr. Clark said he did not know the return on that investment, he acknowledged that it was lucrative.  ''No doubt about it,'' Mr. Clark said, ''we made good money.''  The question of whether El Paso's conduct has driven gas prices higher is expected to be scrutinized by legislators in Sacramento this week. The company also faces several lawsuits, including one by the city of Los Angeles, that accuse it of conspiring with other companies to prevent pipeline projects that could have eased California's energy crisis. El Paso denied the accusation.  With pipeline capacity and gas supplies tighter, concerns about anticompetitive behavior have increased as price volatility has created soaring profits for energy marketers and traders.  Dynegy Inc., a Houston-based energy trader, was once the target of complaints to federal regulators that it had artificially raised prices by abusing capacity that it controlled on El Paso's pipeline to California.  In a filing with regulators in January, Dynegy contended that pipeline companies routinely favored affiliates. ''Abuses abound because of financial windfalls, difficulty of detection, lengthy investigations and increased complexity of the market,'' the company said.  ''There are some red flags right now,'' said William L. Massey, a member of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission since 1993. Mr. Massey said he was troubled by the potential for abuses when pipeline companies own gas and power marketing subsidiaries as well as electric plants fueled by natural gas. El Paso is in all those businesses.  ''What the commission ought to be serious about is: What are the forces at work? Is it simply robust markets responding to true supply-and-demand signals, or is it a market defined by market power and some measure of affiliate abuse?'' he said.  Many in the industry do not believe changes are needed.  ''There are rules in place today that protect against affiliate abuse,'' said Stanley Horton, chief executive for gas pipeline operations at the Enron Corporation and chairman of the Interstate Natural Gas Association of America, the industry's trade group, referring to the rules under which California has brought its complaint about El Paso.  To its critics, El Paso epitomizes the competitive concerns. It operates the nation's largest network of interstate pipelines and owns one of the largest reserves of natural gas. With its recent acquisition of the Coastal Corporation, another large pipeline operator, El Paso has a market capitalization of $32 billion.  At a conference at El Paso headquarters in Houston in February, analysts heard executives predict net profits of $1.7 billion this year. El Paso's much better known rival, Enron, with its headquarters a few blocks away, is expected to earn about $1.4 billion.  El Paso Merchant provides the strongest growth. Two years ago, the unit's profits, before interest payments and taxes, were $99 million; this year, it is expected to have $700 million in North America alone. In its latest quarterly report, El Paso attributed those profits, in part, to ''commodity market and trading margins'' that were enhanced by ''power price volatility, particularly in the Western United States.''  Critics contend that El Paso set out to exploit those conditions. According to the sealed filings, on Feb. 14, 2000, the day before El Paso Merchant was awarded the pipeline capacity, executives made a presentation to William A. Wise, chief executive of the parent company, laying out the rationale for the bid.  The presentation outlined what it termed ''strategic advantages,'' including ''more control of total physical markets'' and the ''ability to influence the physical market to the benefit of any financial/hedge position,'' according to the sealed filings. The passages suggested that El Paso expected the deal to give it sway over the market for trading actual volumes of gas and to support financial transactions it had entered into with other parties to limit its risk.  For every one-cent increase in the spread on gas prices, the presentation said, El Paso Merchant stood to make an additional $2.4 million.  Under the heading ''Challenges,'' according to the sealed filings, the presentation stated that storage was needed ''to help manipulate physical spreads, adding to the overall transport/storage cost.''  On April 14, according to the sealed filings, El Paso Merchant's president at the time, Greg G. Jenkins, wrote a memorandum to Mr. Wise involving an update for directors meeting later that month. The memorandum stated: ''We will make money two ways: 1) increase the load factor, 2) widen the basis spread.''  The language appears to suggest that El Paso Merchant would profit by increasing the gas flow in the pipeline -- the load factor -- while increasing the difference between what gas could be bought for at one end and what it could be sold for at the other end -- the basis spread.  In an interview, Mr. Smith, the El Paso Merchant executive, said that the unit's prices, and profits, on bulk gas sales in California were locked in months in advance, so that the company could not benefit from rising prices in the spot market.  Otherwise, Mr. Smith declined to provide any details about money made on the pipeline deal or about financial terms of the transactions that locked in prices ahead of time. In addition, Mr. Smith said that nearly all of El Paso Merchant's pipeline capacity was used every day when prices spiked late last year, with no capacity withheld to increase prices.  The company did not respond last week to a request to discuss information in the sealed documents. But El Paso Merchant, in a filing with federal regulators, said California's complaint had ''misconstrued and incorrectly interpreted'' what it termed ''snippets of data.''

"I know, I know.  It's still weird to me.  While I thought it was great that Lisa was holding back on the physical side of this relationship early on...I'm beginning to wonder if she really likes him, or just likes having someone to talk to who will cater to her.  I mean, I'm all for prudence when it comes to the physical side of relationships, but after a month of constant contact and interaction I would have to question the fact I didn't feel compelled to completely jump the guy.  That's not to say I would, but I'd still have to question the lack of desire to do so.  I just don't get the impression that she is that attracted to him.  Seems more like ""good buddy"" to me.  I think she misses the Matt's, Alan's, Thatcher's, etc. that she got that from in the past.    On the plus sides, he is a very happy person who loves to smile and is pleasant to be around.

" In our negotiated rate proceeding, the Commission issued a Section 5 ""show cause"" order.  Specifically, TW must, within 10 days of the order, show cause why its actions in offering the negotiated rate contracts (Reliant, Richardson, BP, Sempra, Astra) was not in contravention of Commission policy.  TW must explain the availability of firm capacity on TW's system, and how it has the firm capacity to move gas under the transactions under investigation, yet provide recourse service without interruption.  Drew, Maria and I will work with outside counsel to file the necessary pleading.  I'll get a copy of the order to each of you.  In other news, in CPUC v. El Paso, the Commission issued an order discussing CPUC's complaint that El Paso Merchant intentionally acquired more capacity than needed to manipulate price spreads. The order dismisses denies summary judgment and dismisses the complaint. FERC stated that El Paso Merchant has not violated any standards of conduct. With respect to the issue of market power, the current record is not considered to be complete. However, FERC will schedule a hearing to complete and review the record.

I'm getting out of the office no later than 6:30 everyday (and it's usually closer to 4:30-5:00) and I actually have time to do other things with my life.

As you probably know, SoCalGas is proposing to add compression to its system,  which will result in at least 50,000 MMcf/d additional takeaway capacity from  Needles by Dec. 2001. TW's shippers have gotten wind of this thru the trade press and are already  calling TW to ask about the availability of additional Needles capacity.   Many of them are already shippers to Topock who would love to switch their  primary point to Needles. The issue is this:  One of the reasons Red Rock capacity has been so slow to  sell is that we have no more Needles capacity available, and shippers are  less enthusiastic about shipping to Topock.  Our marketers would like to  earmark the new Needles delivery point capacity for use by Red Rock shippers,  rather than let existing shippers move primary points.  This will help to  sell out the expansion space. I am looking thru my file of cases on the topic of reserving capacity for  expansions, to see if it gets us anywhere.  I'll let you know what I find.   If you have comments in the meantime, please let me know.  We may need to set  up a conference call to discuss this sometime next week.  Thanks.

"Hey,  Just wanted to make sure you're still up for the MFA reception tomorrow night.  I told Lisa about it last night and she said she'd like to go as well.  So...the reception is supposed to start at 7:00 and go until 9:00 and I figured we could either go to an early dinner, or cut out of the reception a little bit early and go to dinner afterward (say around 8:00 - 8:30).  Of course, dinner doesn't have to factor in at all if we don't want it to...just a suggestion.  I'll give you call later tonight to hammer out the details.

As you probably know, SoCalGas is proposing to add compression to its system, which will result in at least 50,000 MMcf/d additional takeaway capacity from Needles by Dec. 2001. TW's shippers have gotten wind of this thru the trade press and are already calling TW to ask about the availability of additional Needles capacity.  Many of them are already shippers to Topock who would love to switch their primary point to Needles. The issue is this:  One of the reasons Red Rock capacity has been so slow to sell is that we have no more Needles capacity available, and shippers are less enthusiastic about shipping to Topock.  Our marketers would like to earmark the new Needles delivery point capacity for use by Red Rock shippers, rather than let existing shippers move primary points.  This will help to sell out the expansion space. I am looking thru my file of cases on the topic of reserving capacity for expansions, to see if it gets us anywhere.  I'll let you know what I find.  If you have comments in the meantime, please let me know.  We may need to set up a conference call to discuss this sometime next week.  Thanks.

"Hi Ashley,  It's so funny that you emailed me today because I was just telling Jessica this weekend that I needed to drop you a line.  Unfortunately, I'm no longer moving to London.  I was offered a job here in Houston trading and just couldn't pass it up.  However, I will definitely tell my friend Emily about the flat...she's always looking for ways to save a little bit of money.  I'll also keep my ears open for any Enronites who are looking for places to live.  Actually, the reason I was going to email you was to let you know I'm coming over to visit again this June.  I will be in town basically the 6th through the 11th (flying in on the 5th and departing the 12th).  I hope you're in town at least some of that time...I'm still frustrated we never had a chance to hook-up last time.  Food for thought...there's an Eagles concert on the 9th and my friend already has tickets with some buddies... I'm was planning on just getting a single ticket and hopefully squeezing in with them, but if you have any interest please let me know and we could just get tickets together.

"Okay...On Friday they have openings at 10:00, 10:30 & 11:00 and Saturday there are openings from 2:00 to 5:00.  Either works for me.  The packages I'm looking at are about and hour and a half long and I thought to buy you some more time I could just visit all the shops.  Here are the two packages I'm looking at...what do you think?  (The lady at the spa recommended the second one)  Fruit Body Facial: A double-exfoliating facial for the entire body leaving the skin feeling silky smooth and shining -- ideal before a wedding or  a special occasion that's just right for that backless dress. You are first exfoliated with crushed Californian grape seeds followed by a light  misting with an orange blossom aromatherapy oil. After a brief shower, you'll enjoy an all-over message with a facial quality message lotion.  Then it's your choice of either an invigorating peppermint glycolic or a calming aloe vera/grapefruit finishing skin treatment.  Benefits: Skin feels rejuvenated and healthy; circulation is stimulated and the skin has a healthy glow.  Time: 90 minutes   Pacific Paradise Body Scrub& Massage: Pineapple papaya lotion is the moisturizer and California grape seeds - nature's anti-oxidant -  are the exfoliant in this 20 - 25 minute body scrub. You'll feel like island Royalty as warm coconut kuki oil is used as the lotion during a 50-minute  message that completes the treatment.  Benefits: Rough skin disappears as the powerful moisturizing properties of tropical oils sink deep into your skin.

Florida should probably be separate.  SPP could be in this RTO or the Midwest.  Therefore, the overall theme that Jim discussed this morning (that FERC has started something somewhat positive, but should take the step to actually state that it wants these utilities to work toward one SE RTO) can be put into the GridSouth and Southern request for rehearing (Tom C. is getting the draft of this.)

As Chair Herbert said:  SPP should have read the Commission's order in May and taken it more seriously.  (Issues for possible rehearing are ****).  ? The Commission declined to approve SPP's scope and configuration because the SPP members remain uncommitted to the RTO and have not made a decision to transfer operational control and the SPP/Entergy relationship remains somewhat undefined.  The Commission wants to see evidence of serious efforts to form RTOs that combine current RTO proposals and Entergy and SPP must file a report by May 25 addressing this scope issue.   o Bulk power sales and purchase figures indicate that natural markets extend beyond the SPP RTO borders.  There are significant sales and purchases between SPP and SERC (and Midwest companies to a lesser extent.)  o Expect the existing TOs to file Section 203 applications to transfer control of transmission to SPP.  o MOU must be clarified to demonstrate that the minimum requirements of an RTO, such as operational authority, ATC calculation and planning/expansion, will be met.  ? Approves Entergy's proposal for a Managing Member that controls all voting rights to the Transco and approves Entergy's Board approval process (states that Entergy would control no more than two of the selection committee's seven members).   ? Allows Southwestern Public Service Company to satisfy its merger obligation by joining SPP instead of MISO.  ? The Commission did not address EPMI's motion to condition market based rate authority on RTO participation.******          ",christi.nicolay@enron.com,susan.scott@enron.com,Re: FERC order denying SPP/Entergy RTO -Summary,2001-04-11 12:14:00-07:00,sent

"As I discussed with the commercial group, it is very difficult to post a minimum NPV because it depends not only on the term but on other assumptions in James' chart as well.  (Steve can shed some more light on this if you see him at Keyex). So I've recommended that we discuss with individual shippers what there needs might be as far as term, then give them a number.  They were planning on calling shippers individually anyway to make them aware of the Needles space. We can use our chart as a go-by so everyone gets treated the same.     -----Original Message----- From:  Fossum, Drew   Sent: Thursday, April 12, 2001 12:24 AM To: Harris, Steven; Scott, Susan Cc: Miller, Mary Kay; Lindberg, Lorraine; Fawcett, Jeffery; Hyatt, Kevin; Lokay, Michelle; Lohman, TK; Pavlou, Maria Subject: RE: Red Rock posting -- URGENT  We need to clear up the ""minimum bid"" issue and this posting would be a good place to do that.

"Hey Lisa,  Hope you had an absolutely incredible honeymoon.  I'm sure it was a blast.  The reason I'm writing, actually, is because I left something at the church the night of the wedding.  I thought it had been taken to the country club but the wedding co-ordinators didn't have it.  Basically, it was a white plastic bag with a little kids t-shirt and a little girls shorts & tank top outfit (along with a little hand painted picture).  I bought the clothes in the Caymans for my niece and nephew, so ideally I like to track them down.  I was hoping you could tell me who I should contact about items left in the bridesmaid's room in the church.  I think the bag said The Wharf on the outside if that helps at all.

For a customer keeping a PNR balance for several days, is it accepta= ble to charge whatever is the posted rate for each of those days, or should=  TW charge the rate in effect on the first day of the balance?  =09Answer:  The tariff doesn't say.  I believe this is a business decision.=   Would we rather charge the same rate every day, or are both parties OK wi= th taking the risk that it will go up or down from day to day?  My understa= nding is that we presently charge the same rate that was in effect on the s= ame day.  I also understand that, rather than documenting the rate in a con= tract or other writing, we rely on our posting.  If we change our practice = and start charging the posted rate applicable to each rate, I recommend at = a minimum that we notify our customers in a posting.  From a legal standpoi= nt I also have to recommend that the rate be documented in a deal sheet, e-= mail or other writing.  While we may be indifferent (after all, Form M says=  the max rate applies in absence of an agreement to the contrary), document= ation of the actual rate could save us hassle if a conflict arises.  =09Another thing:  There is nothing to keep us from charging some shippers = the posted rate on the first day for the entire term of the balance, and ot= her shippers the posted rate from day to day.  However, there can be no dis= crepancy among similarly situated shippers.  To avoid the appearance of dis= crimination, I'd recommend choosing one method or the other, if that is fea= sible from a business standpoint. =20  =09Assuming you are going to use the day to day approach for all shippers, = here are my recommendations:  =09My recommended language to include on the rate posting webpage would be = something to this effect:  BALANCES CARRIED FORWARD FROM DAY TO DAY SHALL B= E CHARGED THE RATES APPLICABLE TO EACH DAY OF THE BALANCE.  (If this looks = awkward to you let's discuss a better way to say it.)  =09I recognize PNR deals happen within minutes.  However, if it is possible=  to do an e-mail or fax, it could read:  The rate applicable to Contract No= . ______ on each day that quantities are parked or ridden shall be the rate=  posted on Transwestern's website for that day.  Another option might be ju= st to include this language as an attachment to the master agreement; it wo= uld not have to be done for each deal.  2.  If we have the following situation:  Shipper A has parked 10,000 dth fo= r a week and wants to move it out; Shipper B wants to ride 10,000 dth; we c= an only accommodate schedule activity totaling 10,000 dth -- who gets prior= ity?  =09Answer:  Shipper A should have priority because it has the greatest tota= l cost commitment to TW in accordance with Sheet 37E of the tariff.

The answer is no.  With regard to state agencies or municipalities, section 201(f) of the Fede= ral Power Act (""FPA"") states that no provision of Part II of the FPA, which=  governs the regulation of electric utility companies engaged in interstate=  commerce, ""shall apply to, or be deemed to include, the United States, a S= tate or any political subdivision of a state, or any agency, authority, or = instrumentality of any one or more of the foregoing, or any corporation whi= ch is wholly owned, directly or indirectly, by any one or more of the foreg= oing, or any officer, agent, employee of any of the foregoing acting as suc= h in the course of his official duty, unless such provision makes specific = reference thereto.""  Section 205 of the FPA, which would would otherwise require an entity to ha= ve rates for wholesale sales of power on file with FERC, does not apply to = state agencies and municipalities.  With regard to whether QFs need power marketing authorization, most QFs are=  exempt (some small power production facilities are not exempt) from most p= rovisions of the FPA, including section 205, which requires public utilitie= s making sales of electric energy for resale in interstate commerce to file=  rate schedules with FERC.  QFs are instead regulated under PURPA, which au= thorizes utilities to purchase power from QFs at the purchaser's avoided co= st.  FERC decisional precedent indicates that a QF can lawfully sell at mar= ket-based rates without seeking market-based rate authorization from FERC, = but that it may nevertheless be prudent for a QF to seek FERC acceptance of=  a market-based rate schedule that would provide protection in the event QF=  status is lost.

The meeting will take place at:  The Omni Interlocken 500 Interlocken Blvd. Broomfield, Colorado  80021 Phone# 303-438-6600 Fax# 303-464-3252 Check-in time  3:00 p.m. Check-out time  12:00 p.m. (Noon)  The  Government Affairs meeting will take place on Thursday, June 14 and will  begin at 8:00 am and will conclude by 11:30 am.  I have arranged for box  lunches to be served after the meeting.   After the meeting, we will have the  remainder of the day for some fun activities, along with a buffet dinner  served that evening to complete the day (on-site dinner location TBD).    Block of Rooms - A block of rooms have been reserved for Government Affairs.   I will be turning in a rooming list to the hotel next week so, I  would like  to know by Friday, April 27 your plans to attend the meeting.     Shuttle Service -  See attachment for shuttle times.  Please note, a return  reservation from the hotel to the airport is required.  Please contact the  Concierge to arrange for shuttle service.  Colorado Weather - For the month of June, you can expect the  following:          High's - 80.............Low's - 52  Flights from Houston - I have checked with TAP for roundtrip flights from  Houston - Denver, Denver - Houston and an exceptionally great  (non-refundable) fare of $190.94 is available.  However, fares are not  guaranteed until actually booked.   Let's book early!!!!!  The activities to choose from are as follows:  Please let me know by May 4  your choice of activity!!!!!!  Whitewater Rafting - A bus will leave the Omni Interlocken Resort at 2:00pm  to head for an afternoon of exciting adventure on Colorado's Clear Creek.   The Arkansas River is one of the most popular whitewater adventures anywhere,  combining spectacular scenery and action packed rapids.  Teamwork is the name  of the game as your team paddles down these tumbling cascades.  Continuous  class III and IV rapids will thrill guests throughout the run. Drop over  Nomad, surge through the Phoenix Holes and take on the class IV climax, the  Outer Limits.  Good physical condition and the ability to swim are  recommended.  The group will have three thrilling hours on the river and will  return to the Omni by 6:15pm.  Chautauqua Park Hiking Adventure - One of the most popular access points for  mountain hiking trails in Boulder is Chautauqua Park. The focal point is the  100-year-old dining hall.  The Colorado Chautauqua is one of only four of the  original Chautauquas still operating in America, as opposed to when thousands  dotted the nation and culturally enriched rural people in the early 1900s.  The tour includes: transportation, professional guide service, two hours of  guided hiking - total time for excursion is 4 hours. (Dress code: Shorts or  hiking attire, appropriate footwear, sunglasses, sunscreen and hats).   Departure time and return will be relayed at a later date.  Spa Services -  The Spa at Omni Interlocken Resort offers a number of spa  services (massages, facial & skin care treatments, body treatments or nail  services, to name a few).  If you are interested in this as an activity,  please let me know and I will fax a detailed list of their services.  You  will need to call the spa and schedule your own appointment if this is the  activity you choose.  Golf -  For the golf enthusiasts, an afternoon of golf at the Omni  Interlocken 27-hole championship golf course which stretches out over 300  acres of verdant fairways is another activity to select from.  Spectacular  panoramic views from three 9-hole courses, which feature more than 400 feet  in elevation changes.  If this is the activity of choice please respond via  e:mail and I will add you to the list.  The game of choice will be ""best  ball"" play.  Biking -  Scenic bike paths are located near the hotel for those with  interest.  If this is your choice of activity, please let me know and I will  reserve a bike and map for you enjoyment.  After reviewing the choices above, please select an activity you prefer to  take part in.  Due to the fact that our group is so large, (which makes it  more difficult to coordinate activities) once you select an activity, we ask  that you not change your selection.

Lisa was none to pleased with me...she wants you to have nothing to do with him, but I told her she has to share the wealth and quite being such a boy hog.

"Okay, so I'd really like to make a trip up there this weekend ( I haven't spent a weekend in Houston during April and can't imagine why I wouldn't just make the month a clean sweep).  Anyway, I know you're unbelievably busy right now and spending an entire weekend with me would not help you in the least...So, here's my suggestion:  I could either come up Friday night and we could do a late dinner (say 8:30-9:00 ) and then find someplace to hang out for a while or just rent a movie.  On Saturday we could get up, work out, grab something for brunch/lunch and maybe even go to Barton Springs (depending on the weather) and then I could take off and leave you the rest of Saturday and all of Sunday to work (we could even skip the Barton Springs piece).

Please let  me know of your plans to attend (today) as well as, let me know by Friday,  May 4 which activity you choose.  gngr 713-853-7751 ----- Forwarded by Ginger Dernehl/NA/Enron on 05/01/2001 12:31 PM -----  Well, the time has arrived for me to let you know what is in store for  everyone at the next Government Affairs department meeting on Thursday, June  14.  The meeting will take place at:  The Omni Interlocken 500 Interlocken Blvd. Broomfield, Colorado  80021 Phone# 303-438-6600 Fax# 303-464-3252 Check-in time  3:00 p.m. Check-out time  12:00 p.m. (Noon)  The  Government Affairs meeting will take place on Thursday, June 14 and will  begin at 8:00 am and will conclude by 11:30 am.  I have arranged for box  lunches to be served after the meeting.   After the meeting, we will have the  remainder of the day for some fun activities, along with a buffet dinner  served that evening to complete the day (on-site dinner location TBD).    Block of Rooms - A block of rooms have been reserved for Government Affairs.   I will be turning in a rooming list to the hotel next week so, I  would like  to know by Friday, April 27 your plans to attend the meeting.     Shuttle Service -  See attachment for shuttle times.  Please note, a return  reservation from the hotel to the airport is required.  Please contact the  Concierge to arrange for shuttle service.  Colorado Weather - For the month of June, you can expect the  following:          High's - 80.............Low's - 52  Flights from Houston - I have checked with TAP for roundtrip flights from  Houston - Denver, Denver - Houston and an exceptionally great  (non-refundable) fare of $190.94 is available.  However, fares are not  guaranteed until actually booked.   Let's book early!!!!!  The activities to choose from are as follows:  Please let me know by May 4  your choice of activity!!!!!!  Whitewater Rafting - A bus will leave the Omni Interlocken Resort at 2:00pm  to head for an afternoon of exciting adventure on Colorado's Clear Creek.   The Arkansas River is one of the most popular whitewater adventures anywhere,  combining spectacular scenery and action packed rapids.  Teamwork is the name  of the game as your team paddles down these tumbling cascades.  Continuous  class III and IV rapids will thrill guests throughout the run. Drop over  Nomad, surge through the Phoenix Holes and take on the class IV climax, the  Outer Limits.  Good physical condition and the ability to swim are  recommended.  The group will have three thrilling hours on the river and will  return to the Omni by 6:15pm.  Chautauqua Park Hiking Adventure - One of the most popular access points for  mountain hiking trails in Boulder is Chautauqua Park. The focal point is the  100-year-old dining hall.  The Colorado Chautauqua is one of only four of the  original Chautauquas still operating in America, as opposed to when thousands  dotted the nation and culturally enriched rural people in the early 1900s.  The tour includes: transportation, professional guide service, two hours of  guided hiking - total time for excursion is 4 hours. (Dress code: Shorts or  hiking attire, appropriate footwear, sunglasses, sunscreen and hats).   Departure time and return will be relayed at a later date.  Spa Services -  The Spa at Omni Interlocken Resort offers a number of spa  services (massages, facial & skin care treatments, body treatments or nail  services, to name a few).  If you are interested in this as an activity,  please let me know and I will fax a detailed list of their services.  You  will need to call the spa and schedule your own appointment if this is the  activity you choose.  Golf -  For the golf enthusiasts, an afternoon of golf at the Omni  Interlocken 27-hole championship golf course which stretches out over 300  acres of verdant fairways is another activity to select from.  Spectacular  panoramic views from three 9-hole courses, which feature more than 400 feet  in elevation changes.  If this is the activity of choice please respond via  e:mail and I will add you to the list.  The game of choice will be ""best  ball"" play.  Biking -  Scenic bike paths are located near the hotel for those with  interest.  If this is your choice of activity, please let me know and I will  reserve a bike and map for you enjoyment.  After reviewing the choices above, please select an activity you prefer to  take part in.  Due to the fact that our group is so large, (which makes it  more difficult to coordinate activities) once you select an activity, we ask  that you not change your selection.  So, please talk to your colleagues ahead  of time before making your choice.  Thanks and don't hesitate to call me if you have any questions.

I've got a trip coming up to the Kentucky derby next weekend...was in vegas last weekend....but will be around here until mid june when john and I go to alaska.  I am slightly ready to slow down now...way too much travel...john and i need to spend more quality time together.  I don't know how you do the long distance relationship..it would be very hard for me.  I guess I crave more constant attention--high maintenance---Ha!  Kidding.  Anyway, it is always great to hear from you.  Hopefully we can talk soon. Take care, Mo.

Enron et al were concerned that the RTO initiatives underway were independently developing RTOs with little emphasis on coordination with neighboring business practices.    At the May 30, 2001 FERC meeting, Chairman Hebert announced this FERC technical conference may be scheduled as early as June.  This is a reversal of the Chairman's earlier resistance to holding a technical conference when he instead favored the RTO filing process to individually address interregional coordination.  The key to the Chairman's change in direction can be attributed to Enron's active participation on the Electronic Scheduling Collaborative (ESC) a non-NERC industry collaborative effort formed to respond to the FERC ANOPR on OASIS Phase II.    By working through a EPSA/ELCON joint filing in response to the ESC filing, Enron was able to raise awareness of the seams coordination threats to OASIS Phase II development and successfully sway the ESC to file in support of the earlier EPSA/ELCON/Enron/Reliant/Dynegy Request for Technical Conference.   Govt Affairs will continue to monitor the development of the Technical Conference and provide needed support to resolve inter-RTO seams issues.

" Entergy filed proposed revisions to its pro forma OATT relating to Ancillary Services Schedules Nos. 3, 4, 5 and 6, proposed to be effective August 1, 2001.  Entergy's basic premise is that the pro forma tariff and ancillary services established as part of Entergy's Open Access Transmission Tariff settlement in Docket No. ER95-112 should be changed.  Entergy states that current charges are based on the amount of energy transmitted by Entergy without regard to the amount of capacity and energy Entergy must maintain in order to provide these services, and that these charges should be capacity-based rather than energy-based.     EPMI -- among several other parties -- protested the filing.   On July 25, FERC issued an order as follows:   - Entergy must define the term ""integrated peak load.""  (In its answer to EPMI's protest, Entergy agreed to define the term as the customer's average load over the course of the hour as measured by the appropriate metering).   - Issues related to Energy Imbalance Services must be set for hearing, as Entergy has not demonstrated that certain proposed penalties are appropriate.  (EPMI had objected specifically to the proposed CRP penalty).   - Issues related to Spinning Reserves and Supplemental Reserves must also be set for hearing.   Although most of Entergy's proposed provisions have been set for hearing, FERC is allowing the provisions to become effective August 1, subject to refund.  Additionally, Entergy asked for a settlement judge, so FERC ordered that one be appointed, and encouraged the parties to resolve their differences.  A settlement judge will be appointed by August 9 and will convene a settlement conference.  The judge must submit a report to the Commission by September 24.   I will keep you updated.

" On July 26, 2001, FERC issued an order conditionally approving the proposed tariff for the Neptune Project, which will consist of several thousand miles of undersea high-voltage direct current transmission systems connecting Main, New Brunswick and Nova Scotia to the capacity-constrained markets of Maine, New York City, Long Island and Connecticut.  As a merchant transmission facility, Neptune proposed to assume all the risk of the the project.  It proposed rates effectively capped by market forces.   Conditions on the Commission's approval:      - Neptune must join an RTO adjacent to or containing the geographic area of its proposed faciliteis and must place operational control of its facilities under the RTO.    - Service must be provided pursuant to the Order No 888 pro forma tariff (Commission denied Neptune's request for a waiver).    - Neptune cannot negotiate bilateral transactions prior to conducting its open season; it must make all capacity available solely through the open season process.
