"Mark,   Further to my e-mail to you of last week on the above subject, I have now  reviewed the due diligence which was undertaken by Enron Houston with local  Indian Counsel (Crawford Bailey & Co.) on the above topic in January 1997.   That due diligence reveals the following:  Prior Reserve Bank of India (""RBI"") approval required to do business in  India:  If  Enron is considered to be ""doing business in India"" (which it  would, for example, if we had a branch or entity there) we shall require the  prior consent of the  RBI under Section 29 (1) (a) Foreign Exchange  Regulation Act 1973 (""FERA"") e.g. to set up the branch or entity.  Please  note that at the date of the opinion from Indian counsel (14th January,  1997), Indian counsel opined that no guidelines had been set down as to any  conditions necessary to be satisfied by a foreign company in order to obtain  approval from the RBI to do business in India.  This needs to be revisited as  to the requirements.  Repatriation of proceeds / Exchange Control:  Please note that in the  approval which would need to be obtained from the RBI, such approval would  state whether the revenues generated in India could be repatriated e.g., to  the USA, or not.  I assume that we would require such ability to repatriate  and so we shall have to ensure that the RBI approval covered it.  We also  need to check if there are now any limits to such repatriation.    FX / Interest Rate dealings:  A. It would appear that if we open a desk in India for FX and Interest Rate  Products for the Enron Group (i.e., an internal Treasury Desk) to trade with  dealers in India then dealings would be required to be in accordance with  either the Rules framed by the RBI or otherwise specifically approved by the  RBI.    B. FX Products could be entered into with authorised dealers in India and  would be subject to limitations on dealings in foreign exchange imposed by  the FERA.  Please note that if transactions are outside the scope of the  general rules framed by the RBI and which are not otherwise specifically  approved by the RBI this may result in a contravention of FERA.  It is not  clear what are the exact ramifications of  dealings in contravention of FERA;  this needs to be investigated.   C. What are the Rules of FERA (see A above)?  It appears that the RBI  requires authorised dealers in India to ensure that their customers are  actually exposed to exchange risk in respect of a genuine underlying  transaction before entering into rate protection transactions to hedge their  exposure to movements in currency rates or interest rates, and authorised  dealers are required to satisfy themselves that underlying commitments are  firm and that forward cover is not being provided for merely anticipated  deals.   The opinion does not state how this verification is obtained by the  dealer.   It appears, however, that there was a relaxation of the Rules  shortly before the 1997 due diligence was undertaken whereby authorised  dealers could offer certain derivative products in certain circumstances to  corporates either by booking a transaction overseas or on a back-to-back  basis without seeking the approval of the RBI.  These transactions are the  following:  1. Interest Rate Swaps.  2. Currency Swaps.  3. Coupon Swaps.  4. Purchase of Interest Rate CAPS/Collars.  5. Forward rate agreements.   In order to take advantage of that relaxation however the authorised dealers  are required to ensure that:  (i) The RBI has given final approval for the conclusion of the underlying  loan transactions.  (ii) The notional principal amount of the hedge does not exceed the  outstanding amount of the loan.  (iii) The maturity of the hedge does not exceed the remaining life to  maturity of the underlying loan  (iv)  The Board of Directors of the corporate to have approved (a once and  for all basis is sufficient) the relevant financial limits and the authorised  designated officials who can conclude the hedge transactions.  Please note that the derivatives mentioned above concern the hedging of  underlying ""loan"" transactions.  Hence query, e.g., whether a simple currency  swap just to hedge exposure in one currency where there is no actual  underlying loan has the benefit of any exemption - and if not, query how one  obtains the prior approval of the RBI to do this.  This needs to be  investigated.  If transactions cannot take advantage of an exemption we shall  need to investigate how one obtains the specific approval of the RBI to a  transaction.     Speculative transactions are void:  Please note that transactions entered  into for purely speculative reasons would be void pursuant to Section 30 of  the Indian Contract Act 1872.  Indian counsel opines that provided the rate  or currency derivative transaction is entered into in respect of hedging or  protection against an actual underlying then the transaction would be valid.   Capacity and Authority: It appears that Enron would also have to ensure that  the transactions were covered by its objects' clause and similarly that our  counterparties' objects' clauses covered the products in which we wish to  deal - there is no third party protection against entities dealing outside  their capacity.  Furthermore, in relation to authority to enter into  transactions, it would appear that we would need to authorise certain Enron  officials to enter into specific transactions through Board Resolutions or  Powers of Attorney and that we would need to check our counterparties'  documentation in this regard.    Derivatives and Borrowings:  If we were to establish a company in India, we  would be subject to the Companies Act 1956 in relation to limitation on the  quantum of monies which it could borrow.   Any borrowing in excess of  stipulated limits would be required to be sanctioned by the members in the  company in general meeting.  Accordingly, in relation to derivatives'  transactions incidental to the borrowing of monies in foreign currency, one  would need to ensure that the underlying borrowing itself was sanctioned by  the members of the company in general meeting. The power to borrow itself,  must be exercised by a full meeting of the board of directors.   Collateral: It would appear that charges taken over collateral provided /  received, for example, in relation to obligations under an ISDA Master  Agreement where the cash charged was situated outside India, would be legal,  valid and binding, as against the liquidator of an Indian counterparty in its  insolvency; however, the approval of the RBI to the creation of the charge,  pledge or mortgage would be necessary in the first instance.  The due  diligence does not state how such approval would be gained nor does the due  diligence consider outright transfers of collateral (e.g., under English law)  rather than charges over the collateral nor does it deal with collateral  situated locally in India;  these issues need to be checked.   Choice of Law and Arbitration:  It would appear that Indian entities may  enter into agreements (e.g., ISDA Masters) governed by New York or US law and  it would appear that provisions for arbitration would work.  Insurance business:  Indian counsel opined that interest rate/FX derivative  transactions would not be categorised as insurance business in India.  Income Tax:  Please note that if an Enron entity, or a branch of an Enron  entity, was set up in India or if Enron appointed an agent there to undertake  such business, then any income arising to the Enron entity / branch in India  from a derivative transaction would be subject to Indian Income Tax.  Please  note however that there are Double Taxation Agreements with USA, UK and  Singapore with India.  However, no details of rates of taxation or further  explanation of the mechanics of the Double Taxation Agreements are given in  the opinion.  Gross-Up Clauses:  Contractual gross-up clauses re withholdings (e.g., the  standard gross-up clause in the ISDA Master) would need to be approved by the  RBI.  Indian counsel does not state how this is achieved.   Close-out netting:  Whilst it appears that the netting concept of an ISDA  Master Agreement would work according to Indian counsel, the existing due  diligence is slightly ambiguous in that it states that an official liquidator  or official assignee of an Indian entity would be able to disclaim  unprofitable contracts which Indian counsel opines would mean the net sum  (e.g., if our Indian counterparty owed us a balance on a close-out against  them in their insolvency).  This needs to be revisited with Indian counsel.  Oral Contracts:  Please note that in relation to oral contracts, whilst it is  possible to sue upon an oral contract in India, it is not possible to take  any steps for the purpose of enforcing any judgement obtained except with the  permission of the RBI under section 47 of FERA.  Indian counsel does not  state how such approval this would be obtained and how long it would take to  obtain.    Mark, I suggest that we should have a brief discussion concerning the above  before I take any further action on the above.  Kind regards  Mark   Apart from obtaining the consent from the RBI to set up a branch or a  subsidiary in India, and then to obtain the permission to repatriate to the  US any proceeds of such business, there did not appear to be any other trade  control or other laws which would inhibit Enron's ability to do business in  India.

"Mark:  I am concerned about committing to the development of legal risk books using  a VAR-like analysis since our attempts in this direction a couple of years  ago failed (Bob Williams and I worked on that project).  Many of the risks  that were identifiable did not lend themselves to the numeric analysis so  near to the commercial guys' hearts and the numbers we came up with were  close to meaningless.  If you want a technical example of a legal risk in our financial trading  contracts, you could use either (i) the statute of frauds (deals of more than  one year in length may be unenforceable if the confirm isn't signed) or (ii)  the widespread use of multiple ""Omnibus"" short-form contracts for trades  before a master agreement is executed (resulting in many transactions where  netting in bankruptcy has not been tested in court).  Item (i) could be fixed  with legislation (as it has in New York).  Item (ii) could be reduced if the  traders/dealmakers were willing to put pressure on their customers to sign  master agreements.  I like the idea of emphasizing the need for buy-in from the commercial side  in the contract negotiation/formation process.  That buy-in needs to be at  all levels and it will only happen with the line folks if they get it from  the top.

"1.  Legal Risk Report -- developed the concept of the legal risk report for  ECT.  I began reporting and managing the ECT legal risks on that basis.  This  resulted in a better understanding of legal risks such as the power contract  risks.  There will be many collateral benefits for the company as a result of  this new technology for legal risks such as better decision making on  transactions and faster focus on solving problems.        2.   Developed and implemented new Chinese Wall Policy  --  in the face of  almost daily breaches of the then existing policy, a new policy was developed  that is fashioned to fit the unique business of ECT.  The traders and  originators helped design the policy and have ""bought in"".  Training was  completed in June.  This new policy should reduce our SEC risk, while at the  same time, allow us to take advantage of certain information.     3.  Lead power industry to develop a standardized form  --  pushed ISDA  and EEI to work with the major IOU's to jointly develop a standard master  trading form for power.  The form is now 80% complete and is modeled after  the ECT form.  The result will be a significant saving of legal time and  effort and more transactions will be completed in the industry with less risk  of an unintended default.     4.  Cutting edge legal work -- identified and solved many cutting edge  legal questions in connection with the start-up of many ECT businesses.   These businesses include (i) the acquisition of competitive information, (ii)  weather, coal, emissions, band- width and electronic trading, and (iii)  acquisition of businesses through contract such as contemplated in the UI and  the Peoples deals.     5.  Carolina Power & Light -- after filing suit against CP&L, acheiving a  settlement at 90% of the value, despite difficult legal issues.     6.  Deals are Us  --  lots and lots of deals done.

We would like to invite you to participate in  the conference as speakers because of your roles in developing the Master  Agreement.  I've attached a proposed program for the conference would  appreciate your comments.  Not all the issues need to be part of the oral  presentation, but could be included in the written handouts.  Please review the program to see which issues you might want to address.  Let  me know if you are interested in being on the program, are available, or have  someone else to recommend as a speaker.  As co-chairs of the working group,  it seems logical to make Patti and Dave moderators. for the main sessions on  the contract.  I've filled in some other potential speakers.  Also, we were  thinking of having speakers on managing trading floor operations and credit  ratings for power marketers.  Any suggestions there would be welcome.  If  need be, we can set up a conference call to discuss working out the rest of  the presenters for the program.  ************************************************************ Andrew S.

Fully 31% of more than 1,000 human-resources officials surveyed by  Philadelphia labor-relations lawyer Stephen Cabot and the American Management  Association reported that employees have sometimes gotten sexually harassing  e-mails; 85% of the employers have policies to avert problems. Employers  including First Union Corp., Charlotte, N.C., have fired people recently for  sending harassing e-mail.

Panther is one of the operating subsidiaries in our DPR Holding  Company relationship with Chris Cline.  As many of you are aware, we are in the process of restructuring the Panther  loan. Panther has violated certain financial covenants as a result of the  lack of coal production when the mine was temporarily idled. These covenant  violations put the loan in default and put us in a position to restructure  certain aspects of the relationship. (All principal and interest payments  have been made as scheduled despite the shutdown).  Part of the restructuring may involve deferring certain principal payments  until 6/30/00 when Panther is expected to resume coal production. Since we  are in the process of negotiating certain changes and since DPR Holding  Company was sitting on $2.0 mm to be used for the payment and/or dividend  distributions, they asked if they could wait until the distribution payment  date in November before making the principal payment. This would give us a  few more weeks to finalize the restructuring negotiations and perhaps enable  them to defer the payment until June. This would also allow DPR to make a  larger dividend distribution to both us and Cline.   I told them that this was okay but that it did not constitute a waiver or  decision to defer the payment. Unfortunately, this was not communicated well  internally. I felt that this was an acceptable action because the company has  the money and we are in the process of restructuring the repayment schedule.  I also viewed it as a minor accomodation to Cline who has personally spent  over $5 million on equipment for the project since January and has not  charged the joint venture.   However, to avoid hurting the relationship or DPR's reputation internally,  Cline made the payment today.

The measure is designed to safeguard potential price  manipulation by generators until new electricity wholesale  trading rules are introduced next year. McCarthy plans to add  ""good behavior"" clauses to legislation proposed by the  government last week and scheduled for discussion in parliament  next month. And an independent advisory body would settle  disputes between McCarthy and electric companies.       Allegations from big industry customers that National Power  and PowerGen abused their market power by raising prices in July  spurred McCarthy's action. The company's combined profits were  $21.7 million higher than profits during the same two weeks in  1998.  The companies ""strenuously deny"" the charges of price  manipulation (Andrew Taylor, Financial Times, Oct. 19).

We have  subsequently prepared a detailed draft analysis and costing of our claims  (the ""Particulars of Claim"") which has been served on ICI's lawyers , Herbert  Smith . They have come back with some requests for supporting documentation  which we are currently dealing with.  The Sale of Business Agreement requires us , unless ICI agree to settle which  seems highly unlikely at this stage , to issue formal court proceedings  against ICI before 21 November in respect of the Halochems. claim and before  17 December in respect of DuPont  . We wish to deal with the two claims  together and , accordingly , it is proposed that we issue proceedings , at  latest , on 16 November . Issue puts us into a formal procedural timetable .  ICI would have 14 days to reply indicating whether they wish to defend and a  further 14 days to issue a defence , though this period is generally capable  of being extended by a further 28 days . The process of discovery , whereby  each side has the opportunity to examine relevant documentation in the  possession of the other , would probably begin after 3 months or so . If we  were to go to full trial , this could be in the second half of next year .  If we don't issue proceedings before the relevant dates , we lose the right  to bring the relevant claim completely unless ICI has waived the requirement  that we issue proceedings by these dates , which they have shown no  inclination to do.The downside of issuing proceedings is that , whilst we are  entitled to withdraw them at any stage if we decide not to proceed with the  claims , we would then be liable for much of ICI's legal costs from the date  of issue to the date of withdrawal .  Our lawyers' view  is that , were we to  go to full trial and lose , the potential aggregate liability for ETOL's  legal costs and ICI's legal costs would be between o1 million and o1.5  million (our current costs are around o70 , 000 ).  In terms of the chances of success of our claims were we to go to full trial  , I believe  , and am advised , that the DuPont reduced steam-take claim is  more likely to succeed than the Halochems. shutdown claim . Given the legal  complexities of contractual warranty claims , I do not think it would be wise  , at this stage , to be overly confident of success at full trial . However ,  there is certainly , in my view , good potential for achieving a settlement  with ICI which may involve more than simply a cash payment (eg restructuring  of key contracts , land deals etc. ) .We do know that , as a matter of  practice , ICI ignore potential claims unless proceedings have been issued .  Issue of proceedings should , thus , be viewed primarily , at this stage , as  a necessary means of getting ICI to the negotiating table . Their costs will  not ramp up significantly until discovery starts , so we should be ready to  monitor closely and constantly our prospects in the litigation as against our  potential exposure should we withdraw or lose .  On the basis of the above , I would recommend that proceedings are issued  against ICI and would very much welcome your views or comments on this.  Regards.  Jon                                                                     ",mark.haedicke@enron.com,richard.sanders@enron.com,"Warranty claim by Enron Teesside Operations Limited against ICI  Chemicals & Polymers Limited (""ICI"")",1999-12-05 05:45:00-08:00,received

The  groundwork has been laid to develop very profitable businesses in each of  these areas.     3.  Aggressive Pursuit of Litigation Claims as a Plaintiff -- pursued  Carolina Power & Light , Shell/Meridian, TVA, Ft. James and many others.   Most have already settled with excellent results.  Successfully defended  Wolfschlager, the last Panhandle case and Jolen.      4.  Lead Power Industry to Develop Master Power Agreement -- ENA lead the  Edison Electric Institute coalition in developing  the first master power  agreement.  ENA will benefit greatly in terms of dramatically lower  transaction costs and greater liquidity.     5.  Reduced Legal Costs as Percentage of Earnings -- brought overall legal  costs to less than 6% of EBIT in 1999, down from 8% in 1998, despite the  upsurge in origination activity.     6.  Brought Finance and Corporate Legal Talent to Origination Deals -- as  the origination work expanded dramatically and became much more complex,  brought in more sophisticated legal talent to deals like UI and Peoples with  great success.     7.

"MIchael:  I will be over for the ISDA board meeting on January 25 and 26.  With the  launch of the credit derivatives business, I think it would be a good time to  do a brief Securities Law/Chinese Wall seminar relating to the credit  business.  I would propose to review the rules we have instituted in NA and  particular issues in the European market.  My preference on timing is in the  morning on the 26th, and second, in the afternoon on the 25th.  Please give  your thoughts on this.  Take care.

We are pleased to announce the formation of the Credit Markets Group which is  responsible for developing innovative products to better manage the risk of  our internal credit portfolio as well as, looking  for opportunities to  provide third party credit protection.  Initially, we will be making markets  in bankruptcy protection on reference credits which are currently in our  portfolio but we expect to add additional credit products and reference  credits very quickly.  The team will utilise EnronOnline as its primary trade execution tool,  looking to quickly build market share by capturing the eyes of our current  counterparts.  Simultaneously,  we will launch an external web site focused  on credit protection where potential customers will have access to real time  prices and filter on specific reference credits as well as, access to credit  models and research papers on effective credit risk management.  Utilising  e-commerce business principles, we expect to aggressively claim the space for  corporate credit protection.  We expect to make a public announcement about  these new products in late January.  In order to effectively access the global market for credit protection, the  group will be based in London with an initial local desk set up in Houston as  well.  Bryan Seyfried will be transitioning out of RAC, where he was  responsible for the Trading Controls and Research teams in Europe, to lead  the group and he will report to me.

John called me back today.  He said the view in the PX is that Enron is  stalling.  I gave him the other side of the story.  He thinks nothing will be  done until the next Market Monitoring COm meeting later this month (the PX  web site does not list the date),  He says the matter will likely be  discussed in Executive Session.  He also believes that the PX wants to meet  with Enron and isn't likely to do anything publicly until after that meeting.  Unfortunately, from talking to John, the perception at the PX appears to be  that this matter should be handled like the Chicago Board of Trade where they  monthly release a list of offenders and what they have done, and nobody  thinks much about it.  It's routine.  That's the wat they want these to be in  the future, but they realize that this one -- the first -- will seem much  bigger than that because it is first.  He said we got stuck because we did something significant and they really  didn't have any process set up to handle these things.  He said the  compliance staff has only gotten some real analytical skills as of Nov  (although he mentioned outside consultants looked at our case).  We also  aren't being picked on.  Other people are being investigated, but we're  coming through first.  I asked about utility pressure.  He said he has been  asked about the investigation by utility people, but doesn't believe it has  caused any undue pressure on the PX.  He said, if they were being pressured,  the investigation would have been completed by now.  He said that they don't want to give the matter any more significance than it  has, but they can't ignore it.  A 3000MW schedule over a 30 MW line just  can't be ignored, he said.  I didn't ask him for a heads' up on the public release of the letter, but I  feel I can call him for updates at any time.

Under the terms of the credit product, on the  occurrence of  a bankruptcy with respect to a specified third party (the  Reference Entity) the Seller of the product (which could be either Enron or  its online counterparty) will pay a fixed, pre-agreed cash sum in an agreed  currency to the Buyer. (It should be borne in mind that this product differs  in a number of ways from the more conventional credit derivatives traded in  the international markets. This means that a change in the nature or terms of  our product or the introduction of alternative credit products will likely  change the analysis below.)  Set out below is an overview of where we have come out on the more  significant legal issues.  I am also attaching a two page ""Executive Summary  of Legal Advice"" prepared by outside counsel which highlights the significant  legal issues/risks in each country and which should be read in conjunction  with this note mail. As you will see, the Executive Summary does not focus on  issues we raised which are ""all clear"" from a legal perspective, so as to  keep the summary to a sensible length  (but there was plenty of good news  too!).  Where a legal issue has been identified, I have either set out below  what action is to be taken, or not addressed it further on the basis that, on  the advice of foreign counsel, the risk is not very substantial or unlikely  to materialise. Therefore, where no comment is made below in relation to a  risk highlighted in the attached summary, please assume that the legal risk  is one which, in our view, it is reasonable to take.  A.  Countries in which the credit product can be traded in January 2000   Finland, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, UK, US  B.  Countries in which launch of the product via EnronOnline will need to be  delayed   Canada, Germany (reasons set out below)  C.  General Issues (applicable in all countries)  The credit product is fundamentally different from the usual energy and  related products we trade and so gives rise to new or increased legal risks  of a general nature:  (i)  Capacity - We will not be able to assume generally that our  counterparties will have the legal power and authority necessary to trade the  product and so will need to check each counterparty's constitutional  documents before allowing them to trade the product online.  This applies to  almost all entities (eg corporates, municipalities, insurance companies) in  all countries.  Some entities may lack the power to trade under the general  law (in which case we will not be able to deal with them at all) or under  their constitutional documents (in which case they will need to amend their  constitutional documents if they wish to trade).    The check need only be made once at the beginning of the credit trading  relationship and so can be added to our procedures.  It is not a particularly  onerous job and will increase the cost of this business only incrementally.  (ii)  Confidentiality - We will need to put in place procedures to ensure  that we are not misusing confidential information about our business  counterparties on whom we are offering credit protection.  Misuse can occur  both in pricing the product and trading it.  The procedures will not include  formal Chinese Walls separating the credit traders from our other traders or  the credit department (a point we have managed to agree with both UK and US  counsel following very detailed discussions).  The procedures will include  (a) the use of a Restricted List in both the US and Europe (similar to the  procedure currently used in Houston); and (b) practical steps to ensure that  confidential information derived from other areas of our business and which  we are not entitled to use (eg because it is the subject of a confidentiality  agreement) is not imparted to the credit traders.  In addition, where Enron  has an especially close relationship with a prospective reference entity, or  otherwise has confidential information relating to such an entity, we will  need its written consent before offering protection on that entity.  Without  such consent, there will be an unjustifiably high risk of being sued by that  entity for breach of confidence.  D.  Country Specific Issues  (i)  Canada - There is a substantial risk that the product will constitute  insurance business, constituting an offence and rendering contracts in the  product unenforceable against our counterparties.  We should try to resolve  this issue with the Canadian authorities before launching the product in  Canada.  Timeframe for clearance is highly uncertain since it is not clear  which Canadian authority would take jurisdiction of the matter.  (ii)  Germany -  Again the issue is insurance.  The risk is higher than in  Canada and so Germany should be excluded initially.  (iii)  Norway - There is a material risk that the credit product could be  regarded as gaming in Norway, in which case trades would be void and  unenforceable.  The normal way to mitigate this risk in Norway is by using a  ""substantial professional effort"" to satisfy ourselves that a trade is being  entered into for valid commercial purposes (normally hedging) by our  counterparty. Clearly, it will not be possible to take such steps on a trade  by trade basis in the context of EnronOnline.  At a minimum, we should  therefore ensure at the outset of the online trading relationship in this  product with each Norwegian counterparty that there is a commercial logic  behind its trading this product type.  (iv)  Switzerland -  If the credit product is the main purpose of our trading  relationship with a counterparty, we should check with the Swiss supervisory  authority whether the product constitutes insurance (the position being  unclear).  If a trade is insurance, it can be terminated by the counterparty  (which is obviously of greater concern if Enron is the Buyer) and an offence  will be committed since Enron is not authorised as a Swiss insurer.  However,  I understand that the initial group of counterparties will be existing  business relationships, in which case we can parallel path this issue.  (v)  US (New York Law)   (a) CFTC regulation - by structuring the product either as a swap or an  option (and meeting certain other conditions) we can rely on exemptions under  the US Commodities Exchange Act.   (b)  US securities laws - there is a small chance that the credit product  constitutes a ""security"" under US securities laws (please see attached  Executive Summary).  However, SEC regulations allow the public offering of  securities to ""accredited investors"" which will allow us to deal with  investors having at least US$5 million in assets.  Since most of our  counterparties will be fairly large, sophisticated players, this test should  not impede the business.  (c)  Insider trading - US counsel have advised that the risk of insider  trading occurring as a result of the product being characterised as security  (see (b) above) is relatively remote.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ -------------------- Please feel free to call me on x36566 if you would like to discuss this  project further.

The following is an approximation of what I have in mind.  ""If desired by KNOC and subject to prevailing market conditions, Enron will  use its best efforts to structure, advise, arrange, underwrite, syndicate,  and/or provide the capital necessary to complete the project.""  I'm sure the ENA guys have better language than this from some of their pitch  books, but hopefully you see what I'm looking for with my first cut.  From a  marketing perspective, we would like this to be as strong and attractive as  possible from a KNOC perspective, and still provide us outs to make the  ""offer"" non-binding.

"There is a proposal to have a meeting of the head traders of Enron, Reliant,  Sempra, Coral, Duke, Southern, Dynergy and El Paso.  The idea would be to  talk about e-commerce in the energy business.  Specifically, Enron might  propose standardization of our masters, start-up of a clearing house for  energy trading, electronic mechanism for confirmations, opening EOL to other  companies to post bids and offers, and discuss electronic protocols for  transactions with other energy companies to reduce costs.  We would probably  discuss the state of regulatory restrictions under the CEA.  What are the anti-trust issues for such a meeting? What are the appropriate parameters for such meeting?

"My thoughts concerning potentially novel elements of EnronOnline:  1.  The online ""making of a market"" i.e. the continuous posting of real-time  prices for both purchases and sales of commodities 2.  The online ability to enter into an energy commodity or commodity  derivative transaction. 3.  The continuous and frequent updating of prices - including the operation  of the ""Stack Manager"" which automates this process in many ways so that the  system can react more quickly than a person. 4.  EnronOnline uses multiple levels of contractual language - a single line  ""short description"" of abbreviated terms identifying the transaction to the  trader, a long description which defines the abbreviated terms and adds  additional legal language and general terms and conditions which contain the  remaining contractual terms and are accepted only once by the counterparty. 5.  The site directs counterparties to different contracts based on the  counterparty profile containing both credit information and information  concerning the contracts the counterparty already has in place. 6.  It may be relevant for any or all of the foregoing that the EnronOnline  system is web-based - i.e. the user does not require any system-specific  software but just a web browser (and an internet plug-in application) 7.  The Master User account gives the counterparty the ability to set up  passwords for sub-users for that entity and control the access and trading  authority of various password holders. 8.  Each user can create customized screens showing only those products in  which he or she is interested. 9.  The system provides for the submission of offers to transact by  counterparties which are automatically accepted or rejected by the system  based on pre-established criteria resulting in binding contracts.

How will you implement it?  Global eCommerce Law & Business Report can help net market makers answer these questions with rich monthly analyses of legal and regulatory issues, best business practices, and the barriers and opportunities that exist in regions around the world. In our latest issue, for example, we provide a detailed evaluation of content regulation, privacy, electronic signatures, and consumer regulation which e-commerce marketers in Japan must consider. Next month, look for a review of the regulatory environment in China.  Also in the current issue, a senior analyst at the Yankee Group explores Latin America's fast growing Internet market, which is expected to more than double by 2003.

Fiona,  please pull together bios on each of Enron's team members and current job  assignments at Enron and forward to Sid and John so they can know who they  are dealing with - - - take a little of the mystery out of first  engagements!  I will forward a hardcopy diagram of the Enron/MG plc  Integration plan - - -  John Gill.  John's role as Assistant to the Executive is a senior commercial  position.  He was recruited + hired by MG from GE Capital and has extensive  experience in M+A activities.  He is assigned to MG's merchanting division  and is a relatively recent hire.  I believe he has been actively involved in  recruiting a 9 person structured finance team.  John, along with Sid Tipples  and David Tregar, has been tasked to co-ordinate the Enron/MG integration.  Sid Tipples.  Like John Gill, Sid is an Assistant to the Executive working in  the financial services division.  I've had limited conversation with him.  He  is actively involved in corp development.  Howard Carter.  Howard is the Director of Finance in MCC.  He started his  career at Anglo Chemical and Ore Co transferring to Philipp Bros when it  acquired the majority holding in Anglo Chemicals.  He qualified as an  accountant in 1979 and became a Fellow of the Chartered Association of  Certified Accountants in 1984.  He joined MCC (physical merchanting division)  when it was established in 1989.  He talked to me about a ""control"" function  that his group performs that sounds somewhat like a combination of Enron's  tasks for originators and structurers.  He seems to pick up several functions  in the merchanting division and Michael Farmer is keen to keep him in the  loop for H/R assessments.  David Tregar.  David is the Financial Director.  He was educated at Lancaster  University prior to joining Arthur Andersen in 1973.  He became an associate  of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in 1976 and  Fellow of the  Institute in 1981.  Since leaving AA in 1978, he has worked continuously in  commodity trading.  He joined MGAG in 1990 and was appointed Finance  Director  of MGL in 1991.  Prior to this he worked for several US brokerage  houses.  He is involved in just about everything at MG (risk, compliance, IT,  treasury, banking).  Personally, David is very open and friendly.  Bernard Page.  Bernard is a long standing employee of MG (since early 1970s)  due to retire in October.  He's had various positions of responsibilities.   Prior to Enron's offer, he was winding down his career by planning MG's  relocation from One America Square to 25 Cannon Street.  Now, it looks like  he will be actively involved in relocating their offices to 40 G.  Bernard  tends to be a little reticent until engaged in a conversation about MG's  business, etc.  He has a solid understanding of the financial services  division and an outstanding working knowledge of MG's office system  infra-structure - - - if he doesn't know something, he knows where to get the  answer.  I get the sense he has known Michael Hutchison for a long, long time.  Michael Farmer.  Michael is Managing Director of the merchanting division and  has over 30 years experience in the metals industry.  He started his career  with A Strauss & Co, a metal exchange broker and tin merchant.  He also  worked for two other metal brokers and was formerly Desk Head (copper) for  Philipp Brothers.  He jointly set up MCC, which is the (physical) merchanting  division of MG, with Dieter Boettcher (Tom's father/uncle/relative???) who  has subsequently retired.  Michael kindly explained the physical metals  business to me and we immediately started connecting on commercial project  development opportunities, particularly in copper.  Michael Hutchison.  Michael is the Managing Director of the financial  services division.  He was educated at Hull University.  He joined MGL in  1971, became a member of the Board of Directors in 1982, was appointed Joint  Managing Director in 1984, and became Managing Director in 1995.  Between  1984 and 1988, Michael was a committee member of the LME and from 1990 has  served as a Director of the LME.  Michael is a very articulate,  action-oriented trader, who just wants to get on with it.  Having said that,  he has been very patient and careful in explaining the financial markets to  me and has provided me with a lot of resources (videos, books, brochures,  reports) on the industry.  Hamish Scutt.  Hamish was a banker with Kleinwort Benson for 18 years and  developed a strong relationship with MG during the latter part, which led to  him being recruited and hired ~3 years ago.  He is very interested in  promoting a ""credit culture"" that proactively assigns  limits and measures  performance.  I get the sense that he has, in his quiet and friendly way,  pushed for more credit control in a productive fashion - - - he wants to  avoid adversarial relationships with the metals traders.  He is very open to  Enron's ideas about credit and is known by a number of people (Lee Munden,  Steve Young) at Enron.  Tom McKeever.  Tom is the Executive Chairman and has been involved in the  metals industry for over 22 years.  He joined MG in 1994 when he became  responsible for the Group's US operations.  His experience with public  companies (Amax) as a manager and director made him a very credible manager  for MG during their IPO and period of public holding.  He lends stability and  balance to the executive team.  He is very practical; for example, he wants  to know who from Enron is going to contact MG staff - - - he doesn't want  them, in their enthusiasm to be open with Enron, to reveal proprietary  information to an unscrupulous competitor posing as Enron!  Tom Boettcher.  Tom joined MGAG in 1993 as a Vice President of the Metal  Division, Head of Copper.  He became a Director of MCC in 1995.  Prior to  joining MGAG he worked for 12 years as Head of Metal Department (Prokurist)  at Norrdeutsche Affinerie.  I have only had limited discussion with Tom - - -  he is preparing a list of development prospects based on a conversation I had  with Michael Farmer.  Kevin Rhodes.  Kevin is the Director of Operations for the financial service  division where he is responsible for the Administration department which  encompasses all aspect of back-office and trader support systems.  He joined  the Henry Bath (the warehousing company) from university and joined MGL when  it took over Henry Bath in 1992.  I have not met Kevin, yet.  Timothy Jones.  Tim is the Director of Trading for the financial services  division.  He joined MGL in 1980.  He was educated at Homefield College,  Christchurch, and started with MGL as a trainee trader.  He has been MGL's  Senior Trader for several years.  He was appointed a Director of MGL in 1995  and is a member of the LME Ring Committee.  I have not met Tim, yet.

"Milly asked that I clarify briefly the Bid Deposit risks.  The Bid Deposit is  due Monday, June 12, 2000 by 5:00 p.m. MST.    General Rule:  The Bid Deposit is at risk of penalties being assessed against  it if a bid is made and accepted but we fail to close on the bid.  Otherwise,  the Bid Deposit is returned (with interest if posted in cash rather than a  letter of credit) if we do not bid or if our bids are not accepted.  The  maximum ""points"" available in the Auction is 20 and the Bid Deposit is Cdn.  $2 million per point for a total of Cdn. $40 million.    There are, however, three indirect problems:  1. related to Project Stanley, a Winning Bidder may be in default under the  Auction Participation Agreement for non-compliance with the licensing,  registration and membership requirements of the Power Pool, and if the result  of that default was an inability to close on a Winning Bid, the Bid Deposit  could be at risk of penalties;  2. also related to Project Stanley, representations and warranties are given  in the Auction Participation Agreement at the time of its delivery on Monday,  June 12th, and which must be ""brought forward"" at closing of a Winning Bid to  the effect that we are in compliance with all legal requirements, and if the  result of not being able to make that representation or warranty was an  inability to close on a Winning Bid, the Bid Deposit may be at risk of  penalties;  3. unrelated to Project Stanley, there is the potential for other penalties  to be imposed between the time the Bid Deposit is posted on Monday and  closing of the Auction through amendments to the Electric Utilities Act  and/or the Auction Rules, and which therefore, would be unknown at the time  the Bid Deposit is posted.  Although I would like to say this is an unlikely  event, to date the Government has been amending documents and rules fairly  freely.

Some officials criticized the bill, introduced by Rep. Thomas Ewing, R-Ill., chairman of the House Agriculture Subcommittee on Risk Management, for diminishing the jurisdiction of the Securities and Exchange Commission over certain derivatives products.  The legislation, as well as a companion bill introduced by Senate Agriculture Chairman Richard Lugar, R-Ind., would streamline the laws overseeing derivatives products and futures markets as well as deregulate some aspects of that industry.  Lawmakers have been struggling all year to revamp those markets. The Commodity Exchange Act - which expires Sept. 30 - determines which agency, the SEC or the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, has jurisdiction over what derivatives products.  A tugging war between the two agencies over how to redraw those lines has slowed progress on the legislation.  Annette Nazareth, director of the SEC's division of market regulation, faulted Ewing's legislation for creating a new kind of deregulated futures trading facility, but then giving the CFTC exclusive jurisdiction over the securities traded on those new facilities.  ""The (SEC) does not believe that there is a justification for eliminating the traditional role of other regulators, including the SEC, in regulating markets and intermediaries that trade such government securities and other products,"" Nazareth said in written testimony.  She noted that it's especially important that the SEC retain its authority ""when these products would be traded on facilities subject to even fewer investor protections than exist today on futures exchanges.""  Treasury assistant secretary Lewis Sachs also found that section of the bill flawed, saying that his agency was concerned that Ewing's bill makes regulatory oversight of clearinghouses optional, not mandatory. He was similarly concerned about giving the CFTC exclusive jurisdiction over all transactions conducted within a clearinghouse.  ""The exclusive jurisdiction of the CFTC may preclude securities regulators from maintaining oversight of organizations that clear securities-related products,"" Sachs said in his written testimony. He added that regulation of clearinghouses should be mandatory and that the SEC should oversee clearinghouse transactions for products currently under its jurisdiction.  Nazareth also suggested that Ewing clarify a section of the bill so that it clearly gives the SEC direct access to audit trails, coordinated market surveillance and inspection authority to pursue insider trading and other fraudulent practices regarding the trading of single-stock futures.  ""The SEC should not be required to seek the permission of any other entity to protect investors,"" she said.  Both Sachs and Nazareth found it ""troublesome"" that Ewing's bill has a lower threshold than other proposals for determining what constitutes a ""sophisticated investor."" That's important because the legislation allows sophisticated investors to conduct a wide variety of transactions with the least amount of scrutiny from federal regulators.  ""We do not believe that adequate consideration has been given to whether $10 million in total assets is a sufficient indication of sophistication,"" she said. ""Moreover, the bill grants the CFTC broad discretion to declare anyone an eligible contract participant.""  Lugar's bill, as well as a report released last year by the nation's top financial regulators, defines a sophisticated investors as having at least $25 million in assets.  Sachs also had serious reservations about the way Ewing's bill relieves regulatory burdens for futures markets, saying that there may be some unintended consequences for ""legislating"" relief.  ""Once such provisions are written into law, the regulators will have no ability to review and amend them should subsequent market developments warrant change or should other problems arise,"" Sachs said.  In addition, Sachs was troubled by some changes to the rules overseeing government securities that, he said, could ""undermine the laws that Congress put in place in recent years that were designed to uphold and strengthen the integrity of the government securities market.""  Patrick Parkinson, associate director of the division of research and statistics for the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve, also criticized a section of the bill that he said would ""leave uncertainty about whether some electronic trading systems for financial contracts between professional counterparties were subject to the (Commodities Exchange Act).""  C. Robert Paul, general counsel for the CFTC, had concerns of his own about the legislation. He highlighted problems with the way the bill handles metal and energy commodities as they relate to electronic trading systems.  For his part, Ewing warned regulators that Congress may run out of time to pass the legislation this year if the agencies can't agree on key aspects of the bill.  ""I hesitate to say, let's pass those parts we agree on. It's pretty easy to pat yourself on the back and just do the easy work,"" Ewing said.  Several lawmakers criticized the SEC and CFTC for holding up progress for the sake of politics. The two agencies have deep differences of opinion over how to regulate single-stock futures.  Ewing's bill gives the CFTC almost exclusive authority over single-stock futures. The SEC wants to share jurisdiction over the new product.  ""I really don't necessarily see this as a turf battle,"" Nazareth said following her testimony. ""There are significant challenges in crafting a framework that protects investors in the way they have come to expect in the securities market.""   Dow Jones Energy Service, 6/15/00 Japan Online Power Trading May Spark More Deregulation By Mika Watanabe  TOKYO -(Dow Jones)- Partial deregulation of Japan's power industry in March hasn't exactly charged up the country's power sector, as industrial and commercial users have yet to take advantage of their newly-won freedom to pick suppliers.  However, the launch of online electricity trading in Japan later this year will likely lure more independent power suppliers into the market, spurring trading activity and possibly prompting the government to take further deregulation steps ahead of a scheduled review in March 2003, analysts say.  Among the early birds hoping to provide the catalyst for this process in the form of a trading system are Japanese trading house Itochu Corp. (J.CIT or 8001) and the U.S.' Automated Power Exchange (X.AUP), which plan to launch a Web-based electric power exchange in November.  U.S.-based Enron Corp. (ENE) has also launched its global EnronOnline Internet trading platform for a variety of commodities and financial products and is approaching companies here with the eventual target of trading electricity.  ""Even though the market will be limited initially, if the trading mechanism were there, a substantial number of large-lot buyers who seek lower prices would participate, while potential sellers who hold excess generation capacity would also join in, to make money from their idle assets,"" said Naoto Hashimoto, a senior utility analyst at Nomura Securities.  As of March, Japan's 8,000-odd high-volume industrial and commercial users - which together represent 27% of total Japanese power demand - are now free to choose their suppliers.  ""The potential is enormous,"" agreed Hideki Yokoyama, general manager of Itochu's power project group. ""Though the performance (of our online exchange) won't necessarily be stellar at first, its early launch should pave a smooth way to grab some 65% of the Japanese electricity market, which is slated to open in the next stage of deregulation within three years.""  Yokoyama also noted a chicken-and-egg effect: while trading activity would likely lead to faster deregulation, specific liberalization measures would lead to more activity. Online electricity trading might take hold in Japan sooner than expected if requirements discouraging potential entrants are eased in response to growing complaints from various industries, he said.  Even after partial deregulation, independent power producers who want to sell retail electricity are still fettered by several inflexible requirements. For example, companies must sign a one-year or longer transmission grid leasing contract and a costly back-up supply contract with existing utilities.  Yokoyama predicts that the Ministry of International Trade and Industry might relax such requirements before the 2003 review.  ""Potential entrants' calls for online trading could set a wave of e-commerce in motion, and that would put added pressure on the regulators,"" he said.  Utilities' Participation Key To Boosting Liquidity  Experts concede that online electricity trading liquidity is likely to be thin in the initial stage, but they say volume will snowball as domestic utility giants enter the market.  APX and Itochu plan to form a joint venture in July for their online exchange, tentatively called JPX, and expect Japanese utilities as well as other energy concerns to invest in the Y1.5-billion venture.  ""We will keep the door open for any regional power monopolies,"" said Yokoyama, adding that some utilities are now studying the trading mechanism with keen interest.  ""It's just a matter of time before some farsighted existing utilities use the new mechanism to hedge against potential risks such as losing customers and falling prices, and this will consequently increase market liquidity,"" predicted Nomura's Hashimoto.  Outside the power concerns, the likely participation of other domestic heavyweights, including Osaka Gas Co. (J.OSG or 9532) and Nippon Telegraph & Telephone Corp. (NTT or 9432) should also provide a tremendous boost to the electricity market, said Masanori Maruo, a Tokyo-based utility analyst at Deutsche Securities Ltd.  NTT, Osaka Gas and Tokyo Gas Co. (J.TYG or 9531) already unveiled in March their plan to team up in entering Japan's retail electricity business.  ""Gas utilities and NTT hold massive excess power generation capacity, while NTT is the country's largest electricity user which alone represents 0.5% of entire domestic consumption,"" said Maruo. ""The combination will be able to play a significant role in electricity trading by taking a two-way position to offset risks,"" he said.  In addition, some domestic and foreign financial firms, including Industrial Bank of Japan Ltd. (J.IBJ or 8302) and Morgan Stanley Dean Witter & Co. (MWD), are set to offer various electricity-linked derivatives, designed to manage risks from fluctuations in demand and prices. Such products could spur further market participation of existing utilities as well as potential sellers.  Analysts say the biggest long-term risks are those faced by utilities which lag behind in doing business the new way. While market participation won't bring them much financial gain, such power companies have the most compelling need to hedge against price fluctuations, as they surrender their price-setting monopolies to market forces.  ""It may seem that power utilities have little to gain from participating in online trading, but in fact, they have much to lose if they stay away from the trading mechanism,"" as they fall behind in hedging risks, said Hashimoto. ""Eventually, they'd end up playing a loser's game.""   The Wall Street Journal Europe, 6/14/00 Philippines Relaxes Banks' Requirement To Raise Capital  MANILA -- The Philippine Central Bank has decided to withdraw a requirement for banks to raise their minimum capital for 2000, a move expected to ease investors' concerns over the stability of the country's banking industry, analysts said.  The decision to eliminate the third and final round of a capital increase for banks effectively extends to Dec. 31, 2000, the deadline for compliance with last year's minimum capital requirement of 4.95 billion pesos (122.2 million euros) for universal banks and 2.4 billion pesos for commercial banks.  Originally, universal banks were required to raise their minimum capital to 5.3 billion pesos by the end of 2000, while commercial banks were required to raise their minimum capital to 2.8 billion pesos.  In the Philippines, universal banks are commercial banks with expanded licenses that allow them to venture into noncommercial banking operations such as investment banking and fund management.  The central bank's decision to relax its capital rule will prevent a loss of confidence in banks that would otherwise have had a difficult time meeting the new requirement, said Angping & Associates Securities Inc. The move will also prevent panic among depositors that could lead to heavy withdrawals at banks or the banks' closure, Angping added.  The central bank's capital requirement for banks may be adjusted next year in line with the new risk-based capital framework contained in the recently passed General Banking Act.  The framework allows the central bank to impose new capital requirements based on the activities banks are involved in and the capital risks tied to them. Higher capitalization may be imposed, for instance, on banks engaged in high-risk transactions such as derivatives trading, central bank Gov. Rafael Buenaventura said.  The central bank implemented a three-stage increase of the minimum capital of banks in 1998 in a bid to strengthen the banking system to prevent a fallout from the Asian financial crisis. Ironically, however, the higher capital requirements indirectly led to the closure of one commercial bank and heavy withdrawals at two other banks earlier this year. Last month, Urban Bank closed after experiencing a liquidity crunch after several days of withdrawals by depositors.  The withdrawals were triggered by rumors that the bank's previous downgrade to a thrift bank from a commercial bank was because of cash flow problems. The bank was downgraded because it couldn't meet the original 2.4 billion peso capital requirement deadline for commercial banks as of the end of 1999.   The Economist, 6/10/00 Danger Signs  An unusual thing happened this week in America. The prices of corporate bonds rose. Of late they have proved a dreadful investment-worse by far than government bonds. How much farther their prices will rise depends largely on what happens in the market in which they are priced: the swaps market. That market is in turmoil.  Swaps are the glue that binds together the world's financial system. First developed in the early 1980s, they now dwarf other financial instruments. At the end of last year there were some $46 trillion of swaps outstanding, compared with $5.4 trillion in, for example, international bond markets.  Broadly, swaps come in two forms: interest-rate swaps and currency swaps. Simply put, both allow parties to exchange cash-flows. In a currency swap, the two exchange currencies and re-exchange them at maturity at the same rate. In the meantime they exchange interest payments.  In a typical interest-rate swap, one side exchanges a floating-rate obligation (generally based on Libor, the rate at which the best banks lend to each other) for a fixed one.  This simplicity has made swaps, and interest-rate swaps in particular, a very useful tool.  They allow banks, for example, to match their assets and liabilities much more closely. If they have lots of short-term floating-rate liabilities (such as savings accounts) but long-term fixed-rate assets (such as loans) they can ""swap"" long-term assets into short-term ones. Likewise, companies can use swaps to convert fixed-rate debt (which investors might prefer) into floating-rate debt, or vice versa.  The level of the fixed rate in the swap reflects, among other things, the willingness of the market to accept corporate debt rather than government debt, which means that the swap rate is calculated at a spread over government bonds. Euro swap-spreads have risen in recent weeks, but dollar swap-spreads have widened dramatically. Ten-year spreads peaked at the end of May at 140 basis points (hundredths of a percentage point)-a higher spread than ever before (see chart on next page). They have since narrowed, but are still wider than at the height of the financial crisis that followed Russia's default. At times in recent weeks, the swaps market has shut down completely; nobody was willing to receive a fixed rate.  What on earth is going on? There are, broadly, two sets of explanations, one relatively benign, the other emphatically not. The benign view is that the rise in swap spreads is explicable by rising interest rates, greater default risk, and the relative sizes of government-and corporate-bond markets.  Governments are issuing fewer bonds. On optimistic assumptions, America's government could buy back all its debt by 2010. American companies, in contrast, are borrowing hugely. That makes government bonds more valuable, compared with corporate debt. It reflects what Stephen Compton, head of bonds at Schroder Salomon Smith Barney in Europe, calls ""the privatisation of the bond markets"".  Rising interest rates, too, are partly to blame for widening swap spreads. When the market thinks that interest rates will rise, there is more of an incentive to pay, rather than receive, a fixed rate. That incentive is greater at times when, as now, long-term rates are lower than short-term ones (an ""inverted yield curve""). This means that anybody receiving a fixed (long-term) rate and paying a floating one loses money.  Then there is the increase in corporate debt Credit Suisse First Boston (CSFB) expects American companies to issue as many bonds this year as they did last, when they sold record amounts. Importantly for swap spreads, one reason that firms are borrowing so much is to buy back their shares. So American companies are becoming ever more highly geared, and hence less creditworthy. Share buy-backs are running at double last year's level and, reckons David Goldman, a strategist at CSFB, will remain in vogue as long as debt is relatively cheap, and firms' managers think that more leverage is good for shareholder value.  If this were not enough, swap-market folk also point accusing fingers at Gary Gensler, under-secretary at the American Treasury. In March, he said that federally sponsored agencies, such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which everybody assumed were guaranteed by the government, were not. The yield on their debt rose sharply. Since they are the biggest actors in the swaps market, so did swap spreads.  Swap knot  Taken together, these factors might seem enough to explain what has happened. But James Bianco, who runs an eponymous research firm, thinks they are not. Swap spreads, he points out, have been widening for the past three and a half years-before any of these other factors cropped up. And they do not explain why swap spreads have risen so fast this year.  Mr. Bianco argues that two things dominate the pricing of interest-rate swaps: interest rates and credit concerns. For most of the 1990S swap rates went up and down with interest rates. That relationship has now largely broken down, suggests Mr. Bianco, because markets have become more concerned over risks to the financial system, as a result of the crises of recent years. If Mr. Bianco is right, this has important ramifications: it suggests there are growing worries about the riskiness of the swaps market, based on fears about the health of financial firms-by far the biggest participants.  Pshaw, say critics: there is no credit risk in the swaps market. Forget about those telephone-number figures: no principal amount is exchanged in a swap, so what matters is not the ""notional"" amount at risk but the cost of replacing the swaps-a far lower number. Moreover, big banks post collateral if they are on the losing side of a swap, thus eliminating even any residual risk.  Really? ""Swaps are perceived as riskless. That must be wrong,"" says a treasurer at a big bank. Unlike futures exchanges, the swaps market looks only at current exposures, not potential ones (futures exchanges demand a dollop of cash up front to cover the second). And the market has grown so much that these potential risks are becoming huge.  So it is at least plausible that people are starting to fret about the banking system. But why might this be a problem in America, of all places? Because it is taking ever more risk to generate the returns demanded by share-holders. Bank lending is growing by 10% at an annual rate, and property lending by 13.5%, its highest rate since 1989. If anything, these rates are accelerating because, after nine years of growth and few defaults, banks' backward-looking risk models tell them that lending is a fine business.  And not just in America. In Europe, too, banks are taking more risk to generate higher returns. At best, the swap market is merely reflecting this increase in risk. At worst, it might be signaling that the world's financial system is in danger of becoming unglued.  End of ISDA Press Report, Thursday, June 15, 2000.

Thank you for agreeing to help us arrange interviews with  Enron employees Fred Lagrasta and Bill Bradford.  To give you some  background, we are representing Statoil Energy Trading, Inc. in a breach of  contract dispute with Central Resources, Inc. regarding losses and costs  resulting from Central's alleged default of its obligations under the terms  of natural gas and crude oil swap and swaption transactions.  Statoil alleges  that Central did not provide the credit assurances required once it exceeded  its credit limit, so Statoil terminated the transactions.  During  negotiations, however, prior to termination, Central and Statoil were  negotiating with Enron regarding a possible assignment of the transactions to  Enron.  This was not consummated, but we would be inquiring into the  circumstances surrounding the proposed assignment.  We would like to  interview Enron employees Fred Lagrasta and Bill Bradford regarding these  discussions concerning the potential assignment, in o! rder to evaluate whether there is any need to depose either of these  individuals.

To  facilitate the wider use of electronic contracts, this protocol could be  endorsed by ISDA. Hopefully, it would become a standard that others would use  for all types of contracts. Perhaps, if necessary or helpful, the adoption of  the protocol could be done electronically by each party unilaterally agreeing  to abide by it, possibly using the same type of approach ISDA used in  connection with the introduction of the EMU currency a few years ago.   Initially, the protocol would be primarily applicable to U.S. counterparties,  but it could be expanded to non-U.S. counterparties as e-signature laws like  the new U.S. law are enacted across the globe.  Basic Protocol:  By adopting the protocol, each counterparty would agree that  the relevant agreement may be electronically signed by complying with the  following steps:  1) The parties negotiate and agree on a final form the relevant agreement,  and appoint one of the parties (""First Party"") to prepare the document for  electronic signature;  2) The First Party prepares the final form in the PDF format (e.g., the body  of the text could not be modified) with the exception of the blank signature  blocks for each party to be placed on the last page of the agreement;  3) An authorized signatory of the First Party electronically signs the  agreement (Note: this electronic signature could be accomplished by  inscribing an electronic handwritten signature or the signatory typing in  his/her name and title in the blank signature block);  4) The agreement, as electronically signed by the First Party, is sent via  electronic means (e.g., by e-mail) by the First Party to the other party  (""Second Party"");  5) An authorized signatory of the Second Party  electronically signs the  agreement (Note: this electronic signature could be accomplished by  impressing an electronic handwritten signature or the signatory typing in  his/her name and title in the signature block);  6) The agreement, as electronically signed by the Second Party, is sent via  electronic means (e.g., by e-mail) by the Second Party to the First Party,  accordingly, creating the fully executed agreement; and  7) Each party would be responsible for maintaining in its own electronic  archives the agreement as electronically signed by the parties.

Basic Protocol:  By adopting the protocol, each counterparty would agree that  the relevant agreement may be electronically signed by complying with the  following steps:  1) The parties negotiate and agree on a final form the relevant agreement,  and appoint one of the parties (""First Party"") to prepare the document for  electronic signature;  2) The First Party prepares the final form in the PDF format (e.g., the body  of the text could not be modified) with the exception of the blank signature  blocks for each party to be placed on the last page of the agreement;  3) An authorized signatory of the First Party electronically signs the  agreement (Note: this electronic signature could be accomplished by  inscribing an electronic handwritten signature or the signatory typing in  his/her name and title in the blank signature block);  4) The agreement, as electronically signed by the First Party, is sent via  electronic means (e.g., by e-mail) by the First Party to the other party  (""Second Party"");  5) An authorized signatory of the Second Party  electronically signs the  agreement (Note: this electronic signature could be accomplished by  impressing an electronic handwritten signature or the signatory typing in  his/her name and title in the signature block);  6) The agreement, as electronically signed by the Second Party, is sent via  electronic means (e.g., by e-mail) by the Second Party to the First Party,  accordingly, creating the fully executed agreement; and  7) Each party would be responsible for maintaining in its own electronic  archives the agreement as electronically signed by the parties.  Also, the following could be considered: (a) adding to the protocol that each  party,by adopting the protocol, agrees to be bound by any agreement entered  into by means of the protocol, and any other appropriate language to enhance  the enforceability of the ""e-signature"" process and (b) adding to the  preprinted form of the Master Agreement, a provision whereby each party  adopts the electronic signature protocol endorsed by ISDA as in effect from  time to time.

The summary has been prepared by Andy Cornfield who is our resident expert on  the SFA's capital rules.  As previously discussed, EEFT - our SFA regulated agent through which we  currently propose to run this business - is subject only to very modest  regulatory capital rules since it does not take any principal positions.  Our  view, however, is that a bond and equity trading desk of the type discussed  will (sooner or later) become subject to SFA capital requirements and so it  makes sense now to estimate the likely extent of that capital.  It would be very helpful at this stage if you (or someone in your group)  could provide a guestimate (based on the US model, but modified where you  think the European positions might be different) of the likely volumes and  constituent parts of these businesses:  after 12 months of trading  after 24 months of trading after 36 months of trading  Please contact Andy or myself if you would like to discuss this.

These events include  customer and employee meetings, and trade shows.    ENA has made some modifications to the process, which are described in this  memo.  The $5,000 threshold remains in effect for all customer events.  However, the  threshold for approval for employee meetings and events has been lowered to  $2,000, and some additional requirements must be met prior to approval.  Please be sure to follow the procedures described below for all meetings and  events, so we can continue to successfully manage these events.  1) Prior to making any commitments to customers or vendors, all customer  events with anticipated costs in excess of $5,000, and all employee events  with anticipated costs in excess of $2,000 must be reviewed by the ENA Public  Relations (PR) department and approved by the ENA Office of the Chairman  2) The PR department will handle the site search and hotel contract  negotiations for all such events.  Once this is completed, the PR department  will work with you to plan and produce your event in its entirety; or they  can provide as much or as little assistance as you require. The PR department  will be responsible for helping you achieve the best value for your program  and ENA.  3) A completed expenditure request form (see attached) and supporting  documentation is required for each event.  Employee meetings require a  detailed agenda as part of the event documentation prior to approval.  Please  submit the completed expenditure request form and documentation to the PR  department at EB 3642, or work with PR department employees to complete the  form.  4) After PR review, the expenditure will be submitted to the ENA Office of  the Chairman for final approval.  Additionally, the PR department can assist in the procurement of tickets for  various local sporting events and concerts.  If you have any questions regarding this process, would like assistance  planning an event, or need tickets for a Houston event, please contact Dorie  Hitchcock in the PR department at (713) 853-6978.

"I spoke with Stacey Carey today after the ISDA call.  I reiterated that we  have been willing to support the process so far on the understanding that we  would prefer a bill that gives us parity with financial products and, failing  that, the minimum we can accept is a bill which exempts (preferably excludes)  energy commodities and hopefully metals from the Act.   She confirmed that  ISDA will continue to push for the exemption or exclusion.  The comments from Treasury to Chris Long recently underscore that our ""Phil  Graham card"", to the extent we have one, is a significant political strength  for us and we should not play the card until we need to.  Stacey agreed with  a statement made by Don Moorehead on this morning's call that Graham will not  start to move in the process until the House has produced a viable bill.   Given that we should probably not seek his help until a bit later in the  process - possibly mid September.

"Mark - I do think we can get this done this year to our satisfaction.  It  won't be the energy provisions that bring it down...it will be the single  stock future issue.    I think we should hold off on the Ken Lay call until we have a better sense  of the movement of the bill in the House and the politics in the Senate.  We  need to have a very clear and well-timed message delivered to Gramm from Ken.  As to you coming to Washington, it would be most beneficial.  But, as I have  said above, let's decide after Congress returns when it would be most  valuable (and you are available).  In the next few weeks,  I will spend time with the Rules Committee and the  House leadership to more clearly know how the House plans to proceed.  This  will be crucial to our Senate strategy.

Michael ---------------------- Forwarded by Michael R Brown/LON/ECT on 09/08/2000  11:49 ---------------------------   Mark Elliott 08/08/2000 14:59 To: Joe Gold/LON/ECT@ECT cc: Michael R Brown/LON/ECT@ECT, Steve W Young/LON/ECT@ECT, Fernley  Dyson/LON/ECT@ECT, Richard Sage/LON/ECT@ECT, Andrew Cornfield/LON/ECT@ECT,  Tim Davies/LON/ECT@ECT, Diana Higgins/LON/ECT@ECT, Tina Ward/LON/ECT@ECT,  Michael Schuh/FRA/ECT@ECT, Gregor Baumerich/LON/ECT@ECT, Heribert  Kresse/FRA/ECT@ECT, Sandip Joshi/LON/ECT@ECT   Subject: URGENT & IMPORTANT: Note re main legal risks re the EEX Spot Market  Joe,  Further to our discussion yesterday, when you mentioned that you wished to  commence trading on the EEX Spot Market on and from Wednesday 9th August, I  set out below the main elements of legal risk, as I see them, in the various  elements of the Exchange Rules.  You should note as a general matter that the  Exchange Rules are largely vague and ambiguous which only heightens the  potential legal legal risk.  The Counterparty to our trades  Enron's counterparties to trades will be the individual market participants  with whom our bids and offers get matched - our counterparty will not be the  Exchange itself or a clearing house.  We shall only be told the identity of the counterparty(ies) with whom we have  neen matched after that matching process has occurred.  There is no mechanism  to filter counterparties based on credit quality, types of counterparty etc.   Hence, there is no effective credit control left to trading participants over  whom they should do deals with.  Collateral Arrangements  As far as security by way of collateral for trading exposures among the  participants is concerned, initial collateral of Euros 100,000 is posted with  the Exchange in one of the prescribed methods (bank guarantee, cash,etc) via  one's ""clearing"" bank.  The Exchange will monitor the exposures of all the  counterparties and can require more collateral to be posted overnight, on a  variation margin basis, if a counterparty is exposed over the level of  collateral previously posted.  Note that the collateral which the Exchange  may require to be posted does not seem to include cover for any unpaid  amounts where a participant has not paid for power delivered - it appears  that it will only cover the mark-to-market value of deals struck on the  Exchange which remain outstanding (i.e., pre-delivery)  In terms of the amount of collateral required to be posted, it would appear  that each trade will be calculated on a gross, rather a net, basis (even for  buys and sells with the same counterparty and not just trades with different  counterparties).  The rules are very vague here.  I would suggest that your  traders and RAC touch base on this issue and understand - by speaking to the  Exchange if necessary - exactly the methodology of calculating our collateral  posting requirement.    Whilst the Exchange will monitor the participants' exposures and call for  margin from the Participants' clearing banks as appropriate, there is an  obligation imposed on each participant itself to be able itself to monitor  its own exposures and its own collateral posting requirement.  It is unclear  whether the Exchange has provided sufficient information in relation to the  model to be used to enable us to fulfill this requirement.  I suggest that  back office and RAC look into this immediately in conjunction with your  trading staff.  Technically we can have our membership suspended if we do not  comply with the Rules; more importantly,  from a good buisness practice  perspective, we should be able to comply with the rules plus be able to know  these figures each day.   RAC and your traders should therefore check that we  can do this immediately.      In the event that a counterparty defaults, there are two points to note.    Firstly, what constitutes a default is unclear.  The Rules state that a  default is where a counterparty is, to quote, ""unable"" to meet its  obligations under the Rules.  Strictly, inability (e.g., insolvency) would  not cover unwillingness (e.g.,, counterparty can pay but does not wish to pay  for whatever reason).  Clifford Chance Germany have advised me that they feel  that a German court would stretch the meaning to include unwillingness to  meet obligations  but, of course, point out that this would be for a judge  ultimately to decide.  Secondly,  even if a counterparty is in default as defined, there is no  absolute legal obligation on the EEX to realise / call upon the collateral  posted with it.  This will depend upon whether the management board of the  EEX exercsies a discretion to instruct the EEX to do so.  In my view. the  Exchange could well take the view that as the trades are a matter between the  individual participants (as the Exchange is not the counterparty), the  Exchange may well be unwilling to realise collateral until the outcome of  arbitration between the parties to a dispute.  Clearly this could be a number  of weeks or months after the non-payment dispute arose and hence increasing  our credit risk.  Please note that there is no clear recourse to the Exchange  in the event that the Exchange itself refuses to realise collateral.  If the Exchange does realise the collateral however, it will hold it for the  benefit of all Participants.  Note, however, that this does not seem to cover  previously unpaid amounts as mentioned above.   Taxes  End consumers can be participants on the Exchange.  As this is the case, if  we get matched with an end consumer, then apparently we open ourselves up to  potential liability to pay German energy taxes.   Clifford Chance have advise  me that, whilst this remains an unresolved issue, apparently the German  fiscal authorities appear only to ensure that German-based entities pay such  tax, rather than foreign-based ones such as ECTRL, which is our trading  participant.  If you require further details on this, please refer to Tina  Ward in Tax Department.  Renewable Energy Sources Act.  Again, if we, as a seller, were matched with an end-consumer, then under this  Act we are obliged to ensure that we source approximately 3.45% of the energy  sold from a renewable source.  I understand that this is approximately 4  times as expensive as normal domestic power, coming in at around 16.75  pfennigs per kWh.  It is entirely unclear how this will be monitored and  enforced in respect of dealings on the Exchange, although Cliffords' view is  that this will be done in some way through the Balancing mechanism.  May be  your traders should look into this in greater detail, should it be of  concern.   Settlement  On a purely logistical level, for your general information, please note that  physical power delivery is T+1, whereas Buyer settles T+2.   The Exchange states that bills from sellers to buyers will go to the buyers  via the Exchnage.  It is unclear how the mechanics of this work (they are not  dealt with in the Rules to any greater extent).  I would suggest that your  trading staff and our settlements staff look into this immediately, by  speaking directly to the Exchange if necessary.  It should also be borne in  mind that I assume that invoices will have to raised and issued within the  T+2 framework.   IMPORTANT NOTE:  Clearly we want eventually to put this trading participation thorough a  formal and final CACs  process (the rules have totally altered since we  CACs'd it last time three weeks ago).  However, I understand that you would  like to be able to trade from tomorrow, which will be a few days in advance  of the CACs  process (additional rules in German have only just been sent to  me, and hence I cannot tell you at present what is the import of these).  In  this respect, please note that ECTRL is joining as a Market-Maker and hence,  under the Exchange Rules, if you wish to proceed, we would have the  obligation from tomorrow to quote firm two way prices during normal market  opening hours.  The Exchange can promulgate rules prescribing the length of  time for which bids / offers are active, minimum / maximum volumes bid /  offerred, the width of spreads, etc.,.; I understand from Clifford Chance  that the Exchange has not yet prescribed these rules.  What we do know at the  moment is that if we fail ""too often"" to quote as a market maker, then the  exchange can remove / suspend us as a trading participant.  In order to  mitigate your risk at present therefore, you may wish to consider the size of  volumes we would quote and width of spreads, etc.., and discuss with RAC and  / or Credit beforehand.  Finally, I understand that: (a) Dresdner's banking terms for us have still  not been agreed (apparently these are being dealt with at an Enron Houston  Legal Department level) and therefore I cannot tell you whether Dresdner  would be willing to provide the collateral guarantee etc before these are  agreed and (b) I understand that the EEX still has some outstanding points re  our Balancing arrangements which would need to be finalised before we could  trade.  Sandip is in contact with Enron Houston over (a) and I understand  that Heribert and Michael Schuh are dealing with the Balancing  arrangements.     Subject to clearing the items in (a) and (b), and discussing volumes, spread  etc with RAC / Credit etc.,  if you wish to proceed tomorrow, please let me  know as I shall need to write to the Exchange this afternoon informing them  of this (our application forms were submitted under the caveat that we would  write to them when we wished our membership to go active).

In anticipation of that, I would appreciate your input on how the documentation is made available and, in particular, the pricing of that access.   For anyone other than an ISDA member, the documents will be made available in electronic PDF form for purchase on a per document basis. For members, two additional options will be made available for access to interactive versions of the documentation: an internet version and an intranet version.   The internet version will consist of the complete library of ISDA documentation in an interactive version also in PDF format. The documents will include internal links within documents (section reference to the section itself, use of a defined term to its definition) as well as links to User's Guides that have been published for a particular document. We propose that the pricing of this option will be on a per user annual fee basis.   The intranet option will permit users to take the full library of ISDA documents and place it on a firm's intranet, thereby providing access to anyone within the firm who has access to the intranet. ISDA would charge a fixed annual fee for this service.    I would appreciate your responses to the following questions:   1. Ignoring cost, do you think your institution would be more likely to use the internet version of the documents or take them onto your intranet?    2. If you are more likely to use the internet version, how many users would you anticipate worldwide within your institution?   3. For the internet service, would you prefer to pay (a) a high initial fee for the first user (e.g., $5,000) and a small additional fee for each incremental user (e.g., $100) or (b) a lower initial fee (e.g., $3,000) and a larger additional fee for each incremental user (e.g., $500)? Assume for these purposes that the cost of the intranet service is $10,000 per annum.   4. Would your answer to question 3 change if the cost of the intranet service were $15,000?   I will not hold you to any of these answers. I just hope to get your input as we proceed to further consideration at the Board level of how electronic delivery of documentation will work and how it will be priced.   Thank you for your input.

Mark  We can make this even simpler.  All broker trades are confirmed the next  day.  We would only need to record trader deals when they deal direct which  is rare and all marketer deals.

As a  part of the merger-related activity, Engage (which is a limited partnership)  is being split as between its two owners, Westcoast and Coastal.   Virtually all of my clients (the ""big deal"" Structured Power Group here at  Engage) are moving with a subsidiary of our other owner, Westcoast, while I  am remaiining here in Houston with Engage, which is a Coastal subsidiary.?  So, despite the fact that power is a growth area, my propsects vis a vis the  merger are less good than if I were still supporting a substantial client  base.? So, I am now looking at other opportunities that may be available,  despite the fact I have been with Engage only a year.  Attached you will find a cover letter and my resume.?

"Mark   Dan Reck is hoping to enter into discussions with Canadian National, who are  insisting upon the inclusion of a non-raid provision in the confidentiality  agreement, the offending clause is attached.  In speaking with Dan, his view is that it is more likely that Canadian  National would want to employ some of our people than us wanting to employ  any but their most senior people.  The period proposed is for one year after the date we have terminated our  discussions. I have asked that Canadian National consider a 6 month period  and they have not yet responded.  In looking at the legal policy on this, I see that the head business person  and you, as the General Counsel, will need to be comfortable with this  provision.

The various trade associations will be most responsive to the idea if they are hearing strong support for a single agreement from decision-making levels within member firms. We will separately continue or commence a dialogue with the trade associations that sponsor various agreements or are active in the areas of the financial products that would be covered by such an agreement.  The trade associations we have identified as likely to be important to this project are the following:  Securities Industry Association (US) The Bond Market Association (US) International Securities Market Association (principally Europe) European Banking Federation (Europe) The Foreign Exchange Committee (NY, London, Tokyo) Emerging Markets Traders Association  The following associations may also be helpful to the process:  Australian Financial Markets Association British Bankers Association Japan Securities Dealers Association Canadian Bankers Association International Primary Markets Association (London-based) ACI (The Foreign Exchange Association)(Paris-based)_  If your firm is active in any of these organizations, we encourage you to discuss as soon as possible with your representative within that organization the need to support the development of a single agreement for financial products and urge them to express their support to the associations. If it would be useful to share with them the thoughts in my memorandum to the board, please feel free to do so. I have attached an edited version which deletes the last couple of sections on my discussions with the BMA, the Russo-Carlin group, Ernie Patrikis's letter and possible approaches for ISDA.

Please advise on the following:     1.  We continue to feel the name of the committee (including Power) is not sufficiently expansive to accommodate the growing markets involving energy and other new derivatives. We were considering something like Energy and Developing Derivative Markets?  We thought the old name Commodities had a traditional rather than a forward-looking sound to it. What are your thoughts?  I like Energy/Emerging Markets Committee or  Energy and Emerging Markets Committee.     2.  As we discussed a couple of weeks ago, invites should go to US companies and non-US companies with a US presence in the energy/commodity markets. Non-members should be invited as in London. We told people at the London meeting about the Houston meeting so they are on notice. Also, if there are minutes of that meeting produced soon they will probably refer to the meeting so there may be no need to invite them. Individual call-ins should be discouraged, but we might consider giving people an opportunity to gather at ISDA NY and plug a small group in from there. It's unlikely we will get many people from NY to go to Houston just for this meeting.  I am ok with plugging people in from NYC so long as we  know exactly who we are plugging in.     3.  When you suggested Enron as the venue, were you offering a conference room or should we be considering the Doubletree or somewhere else?  .  Did we ever settle hours, etc. and whether there should be some kind of ""social event"" afterwards and for whom?  All of this is obviously intended to increase the profile/activity of the committee; highlight the upcoming conference; focus on the issues that are not as significant to the European committee. Should we agree to a general social event, we'll include in the attached draft invitation.  I am ok having a  social event, but wonder if we shouldn't see how this meeting goes and plan  next time accordingly.  Please schedule a room at the Doubletree.  I would  suggest 3:30 and plan on a two hours meeting.     4. Attached is a draft invitation. Please comment on the text, etc.   Would you prefer to be the signatory? No     <<Energy Agenda Draft.doc>>     I look forward to your thoughts.

Policy on Noncompetition.  I  would appreciate if you would check with your CEO/COO regarding this e-mail  and respond to me by Friday, September 29 if you have questions or concerns.   Enron APACHI may need to commit to the following provisions (that bind Enron  affiliates) by Monday, October 2.  Given the consolidating power generation market in Asia Pacific, Enron Asia  Pacific/Africa/China (Enron APACHI) is proposing to enter into a transaction  with Marubeni and Sithe Asia to combine the respective power generation  portfolios into a single company (Newco).  Newco would be charged with making  the shareholders' investments as liquid as possible to allow for sale of the  shareholders' respective stakes in Newco.    The shareholders believe that Newco must not be seen by the market as a  ""dumping ground"" for existing power projects but rather as the vehicle  through which the investors will continue to pursue power generation  opportunities in Asia.  As a result, Enron APACHI proposes to include  competition restrictions in the Marubeni/Enron Shareholder Agreement that  would bind their respective affiliates.    The following is a summary of these competition provisions:  Enron affiliates (with the exceptions stated below) could only develop or own  power projects in the Asia Pacific Region (as defined below) after first  offering the opportunity to Newco.  If Newco declines the opportunity, Enron  would be free to own the project itself or offer the project to third parties  provided that the terms do not materially improve.  Development or ownership  does not include the provision of construction, O&M, offtaker or risk  management services.  There are a number of exceptions to this rule:  (a) small projects involving  20 MW or less; (b) projects in which Enron owns less than a 1/3 interest; (c)  projects initiated by our SK joint venture; (d) Korean projects using natural  gas produced by Enron; (e) projects obtained in a corporate acquisition in  which Asia generation is less than 20% of the value of the acquisition; and  (f) situations in which any Enron company would be exposed to fiduciary  liability to another shareholder in complying with the competition  restriction.  ""Affiliates"" will be defined to exclude Enron affiliates which are  publicly-owned (e.g., Azurix).  ""Asia Pacific Region"" will be defined to include Brunei, China (including  Hong Kong and Macau), South Korea, North Korea, Taiwan, Vietnam, Laos,  Cambodia, Thailand, Myanmar, the Philippines, Malaysia, Indonesia, East  Timor, Singapore, Papua New Guinea and the Pacific Islands (including Guam,  Saipan, the Federated States of Micronesia, and Fiji, but excluding Hawaii).   It does not include Japan and Australia.  The competition clause would survive until the earlier of (a) Enron selling  its interest in Newco or (b) December 31, 2003.

"Mark,  I have discussed your note with Justin and Paul and wanted to give you some  feedback.   Masters combining Physical and Financial transactions  The view was that whilst we would obviously take advantage of such  documentation if it were developed, the current need for such a product at  Enron Europe is limited and so we probably would not want to commit resource  to leading an effort to develop it. Differences in delivery obligations and  physical supply systems make such documentation extremely difficult to  develop, and we have in the past, on the few occasions when the need has  arisen, used our own physical contracts and bridged those into master  agreements for financial transactions.   Merging the numerous financial Masters now available in the market.  The paper attached to your note seems more focussed on this issue. I can  understand ISDA from a market positioning perspective not wanting to ignore  the competition and possibly wanting to join forces with them. Again,  however, the operational benefits such a merger would be likely to bring to  Enron Europe would probably be marginal: ISDA is gaining more and more market  acceptability in Europe and changes may serve, initially at least, to slow  the rate of acceptance of ISDA as standard documentation, rather than  accelerate it.    That was about it. I'd be happy to discuss this further next week in Houston  if you think that would be useful.

The various trade associations will be most responsive to the idea if they are hearing strong support for a single agreement from decision-making levels within member firms. We will separately continue or commence a dialogue with the trade associations that sponsor various agreements or are active in the areas of the financial products that would be covered by such an agreement.  The trade associations we have identified as likely to be important to this project are the following:  Securities Industry Association (US) The Bond Market Association (US) International Securities Market Association (principally Europe) European Banking Federation (Europe) The Foreign Exchange Committee (NY, London, Tokyo) Emerging Markets Traders Association  The following associations may also be helpful to the process:  Australian Financial Markets Association British Bankers Association Japan Securities Dealers Association Canadian Bankers Association International Primary Markets Association (London-based) ACI (The Foreign Exchange Association)(Paris-based)_  If your firm is active in any of these organizations, we encourage you to discuss as soon as possible with your representative within that organization the need to support the development of a single agreement for financial products and urge them to express their support to the associations. If it would be useful to share with them the thoughts in my memorandum to the board, please feel free to do so. I have attached an edited version which deletes the last couple of sections on my discussions with the BMA, the Russo-Carlin group, Ernie Patrikis's letter and possible approaches for ISDA.

I am still operating the fitness company but it is quickly coming to an end  due to running out of money so I am looking forward to finding a new position  in the next couple of weeks.

(PG&E), in filings with the California Public=20 Utilities Commission (CPUC) and California Independent System Operator=20 (Cal-ISO), has requested that a rate cap be placed on wholesale purchases= =20 in the state. The utility is asking the CPUC to lower the current rate=20 cap from $250 per megawatt hour to $100, or 10 cents per kilowatt hour.=20 In seeking the rate cap, PG&E is joined by Edison International, the parent= =20 company of Southern California Edison, and The Utility Action Network (TURN= ),=20 a ratepayer advocacy group.  ANALYSIS: The current rate cap of $250 per megawatt hour in the wholesale= =20 market of California resulted from the price spikes experienced in San=20 Diego this summer. As San Diego Gas & Electric had paid off its stranded=20 costs, the retail rate freeze in its area was lifted and SDG&E customers=20 were exposed to market-based prices, which doubled and at times tripled=20 due to increased demand in the state and power supply concerns. PG&E=20 customers=20 were not exposed to the price spikes because, at the time, PG&E had not=20 paid off its own stranded costs and was still under a retail rate freeze.  Yet the company has felt the impact from the price spikes just the same.=20 PG&E buys a great deal of its power on the wholesale market, and as a resul= t=20 is about $2.2 billion in debt (some figures suggest it is as high as $2.7= =20 billion). Due to the retail rate freeze still in effect, PG&E has been=20 unable to pass this debt on to customers by raising its rates. In real=20 terms, PG&E was paying up to 19 cents per kilowatt hour on the wholesale=20 market this summer, when by law it was only allowed to charge its customers= =20 on average 5 cents per kilowatt hour. In total, PG&E has paid about $2.7=20 billion more to suppliers than it can bill customers for, and this amount= =20 is growing by hundreds of millions each month. This explains the utility's= =20 motivation in wanting to see the CPUC further lower the cap on wholesale=20 rates in California.  However, even though PG&E as a whole is in debt, the utility=01*as well as= =20 other divisions under parent company PG&E Corp.=01*is still making money of= f=20 deregulation in California. For instance, PG&E's Diablo Canyon nuclear=20 plant has been able to capitalize on the high value of power on the wholesa= le=20 market. The utility confirmed recently that altogether its power facilities= =01* the=20 ones left after the utility was forced to divest the bulk of its power=20 assets=01*still provide about $150 million a month to the utility. In addit= ion,=20 PG&E Corp.'s unregulated energy commodity trading operation has been doing= =20 very well. And the unregulated National Energy Group=01*which operates in= =20 markets outside of California, such as Massachusetts, Rhode Island and=20 New Hampshire=01*posted a 233-percent profit increase for the second quarte= r.=20 Thus, it is important to note the distinction between PG&E and its parent,= =20 PG&E Corp. Ironically, as a whole, PG&E Corp. has stated that it does not= =20 support rate caps, and has opposed the issue when it has surfaced in other= =20 states.  PG&E reported second-quarter earnings of $216 million on $2.3 billion in=20 revenue, representing a 26-percent increase over the same quarter last=20 year. Third quarter earnings also reportedly will be strong. This puts=20 PG&E in an awkward predicament. On one hand, PG&E wants to convince=20 shareholders=20 that the company is doing well and making money from the commodities that= =20 it sells. On the other hand, PG&E is attempting to convince regulators=20 that it is losing money due to the high wholesale prices that it must pay= =20 for power. In fairness, though, the revenue PG&E has earned cannot come=20 anywhere near to paying off the massive debt the company has accrued due=20 to its obligation of serving customers.  PG&E's rate freeze is scheduled to end March 31, 2002, at the very latest,= =20 or sooner if it is determined that PG&E's stranded costs have been repaid,= =20 something that utility executives say may already have taken place. Due=20 to higher-than-expected revenues and higher-than-market valuations of the= =20 utility's assets, it may very well be the case that PG&E's stranded costs= =20 are already paid off. When this is officially determined by the CPUC, PG&E= =20 will argue that customers should be liable for some or all of the debt=20 it has assumed while the rate caps were in place. The CPUC has scheduled=20 a hearing to address these issues on Oct. 19. The core question of these=20 proceedings will be whether or not PG&E should be allowed to turn over=20 its debt to customers through rate increases once the rate freeze is lifted= .=20 PG&E wants to be able to retroactively bill customers for its debt, based= =20 on the date which the CPUC determines that PG&E had in fact paid off its=20 stranded costs, a point groups such as TURN will surely protest.  It may seem surprising that TURN was among the group with PG&E that filed= =20 the petition to lower the rate cap on wholesale prices. Typically, TURN=20 and PG&E (along with most utilities) are at polar opposites regarding most= =20 issues. However, both agree that wholesale rates are too high and want=20 to see a new cap put into place, but for completely different reasons.=20 TURN says that PG&E and other utilities took a risk when agreeing to the=20 rate freeze and they should not be allowed to pass debts that resulted=20 from that risk onto customers. TURN continues to retain a watch over the=20 proceedings related to PG&E's proposal, specifically with regard to the=20 possibility that the CPUC will allow the utility to raise rates on customer= s.  Within the course of these new developments, it's important to be clear=20 on PG&E's motivations. Some California lawmakers and consumer advocates=20 have called for a complete return to regulation, arguing that deregulation= =20 in California has become a failed experiment. Many have surmised that PG&E'= s=20 proposal for wholesale caps is essentially a call to return California=20 to a regulated structure. I think this is a misinterpretation. PG&E has=20 very clearly stated that its proposal is a ""necessary short-term step to=20 try to bring prices back in line."" PG&E's efforts really shouldn't be viewe= d=20 as a move to return California to a regulated market. Rather, PG&E is merel= y=20 attempting to protect its own interests. The utility wants to secure=20 temporary=20 lower rates for the power it needs to buy on the wholesale market and=20 transfer=20 its debts to customers once the rate freeze is lifted. A return to regulati= on=20 via a permanent rate cap would not be in PG&E's best interests as it=20 continues=20 to sell power from its nuclear plant. In addition, PG&E probably recognizes= =20 that regulation would discourage additional companies from building new=20 power plants in California, which would not be good for the long-term econo= my=20 of the state. This also would do little to lower wholesale prices in=20 California.=20 As we discovered this summer, the less supply, the higher the price for=20 power.=20  PG&E's proposal to lower rate caps on wholesale prices is, more than anythi= ng=20 else, an attempt to protect itself from what it perceives as disastrous=20 economic impact if it is not able to transfer its debt to customers. A=20 recent Wall Street Journal report inferred that if wholesale prices continu= e=20 to exceed what PG&E can charge customers, the utility could become=20 ""technically=20 insolvent"" sometime next year. It will be interesting to see if the CPUC=20 has the same perception when it evaluates PG&E's proposal later this month.= =20  =3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D= =3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D= =3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D Need to design and implement your IT infrastructure?

Just got a call from Jan Smutney-Jones.  Apparently, word is on the  street that Peace intends to begin targeting Enron as an example of the  ""misconduct"" that Peace alleges has occured in California's markets.  Smutney  thinks Peace may be keying off the comments of the ""unnamed"" trader in the  Dow article claiming that Enron's been buying power and holding on to it.   Apparently Peace's other angle is/will be:  ""The same people who colluded in  the design of this market are now colluding to profit unfairly from it.""  No  idea of when and how Peace might launch any attacks.  Two immediate thoughts:  Apart from the bad reporting in the Dow article, that article shows that  Enron got beat by, among others, two federal (Canada and the US), one state  (SRP) and one municipal (LADWP) government. David Freeman, who now heads up LADWP, was appointed ""Czar"" by the State of  California and charged with the task of implementing Steve Peace's brain  child (AB 1890).  Freeman set up the ISO and PX market structures.  He also  set up the Governing Boards.

In this regard we had agreed to talk  to Stikeman Elliott about representation.  It turns out the Stikemans has an  unresolveable conflict, as it acts for Enmax, the City of Calgary's retail  affiliate and a direct competitor.  From asking around, it also seems that  any of the firms which have/may have experience in the developing retail  market, have acquired that experience for a client that would put them in  direct conflict as well (ex. Bennet Jones - Atco/Canadian Utilities;  Macleod  Dixon and McCarthy Tetrault - TransAlta;  Burnet Duckworth - City of  Calgary/Enmax/City of Medicine Hat;  Borden Ladner Gervais - EPCOR), many of  whom we have no experience in dealing with in any event.  It seems to me that  the available alternatives are Blake Cassels & Graydon and Osler Hoskin &  Harcourt, neither of whom to my specific knowledge have specific expertise in  this area.  However, as noted, those with any actual (or purported) expertise  tend for that reason to be conflicted.  Accordingly, my suggestion is that I  speak to Blakes to see what expertise they have, but likely nonetheless  retain them (assuming there is no conflict) on the basis of their general  capabilities and their understanding and commitment to Enron.  At the end of  the day, even if there is a learning curve, it is seemingly learnable and  inevitable.  Please let me know if you have a problem, as we need to move  quickly to get on with the project.  To confirm, you were going to let me know how we should proceed with  structuring the affiliate (liability vs. tax efficiency), which may be  affected by how and if EES participates.  Once the ball is rolling on the Alberta electricity front, we will re-focus  on gas and other jurisdictions, such as Ontario.  Regards, Peter.

It is generally ok to have confirmations signed by certain carefully  selected directors since we are confirming a trade that already took place  and there is master agreement already signed. 3.

I attach a letter EECC signed and sent out to the EcoElectrica project  yesterday re the need to schedule a senior management meeting to try and  resolve outstanding issues and payments due EECC for this project, We have  been trying to schedule meetings to resolve these matters since September,  but the project, perhaps because of Mission Energy's impact, has not yet  agreed to a meeting to resolve the matter.      With David Haug's help  we were able to get a significant portion of  undisputed payments that had been delinquent for some time (in some cases  since before the first of the year) paid. including a recent payment of $6  million. Even so, approximately $18 million still remains unpaid to EECC and  seriously delinquent.  EcoElectrica has identified $8.4 million as being  withheld in connection with disputed liquidated damage payments, but there  remains an undisputed, unpaid balance of approximately $9.6 million that  EcoElectrica has not offered any contractual or other explanation for  withholding other than that  they are working on other matters.  Larry Izzo needs to get these claims resolved, and at least needs a  commitment from EcoElectrica to a date for formal senior management  discussions under the contract from the project.

"Mark, I am not completely sure what the other groups want to do; however,  assuming a fixed amount of the ""internal"" legal costs are fairly represented  by this allocation as ENA's ""capacity"" charge, you are correct.  This number  will be in the P/L under your name.  The ""outside"" legal costs should be  tracked and controlled and carried at the business unit (by deal) level.   I  need an estimate of the quarterly ""capacity charge"" for ENA and an estimate  of outside legal costs by business unit.

As  you will recall, PG&E had difficulty starting the unit, apparently as a  result of a faulty gearbox in the original FT4A11 engine, and therefore we  agreed to swap out the A11 engine and replace it with the A9 engine.  It was  apparently represented to PSM by PG&E that the replacement A9 engine had been  completely overhauled.  PSM's testing and discussions with the shop that was  to have performed the overhaul, both of which occurred subsequent to closing,  have confirmed that the A9 was not overhauled but was simply serviced in  order to allow it to start.  PSM prepared a letter to send to PG&E demanding that the faulty A9 engine be  replaced with the original A11 engine.  I have reviewed that letter and  revised it substantially.  I enclose a copy of that letter as revised by me  for your review and comment.    Also, given that PSM was acting on ENA's behalf in performing the due  diligence on the PG&E unit and given that ENA relied on PSM's due diligence  in acquiring the PG&E unit, I have prepared an additional cover letter to  PSM.  I attach a copy of that cover letter for your review as well, which  letter is fairly aggressive in its current form.  It clearly identifies both  that (i) my comments on the PG&E letter are made only to protect and preserve  ENA's rights and interests and do not represent legal or other advice to PSM  regarding their position and may not be relied upon by PSM as such and (ii)  that we are preserving all of ENA's rights and causes of action that ENA may  have against PSM with respect to these matters.  It seems to me that, if the  engine is in fact in such poor condition, PSM should have discovered that  prior to our closing the deal.  I understand the PSM may have performed  boroscope testing on the original A11 engine but did not, for whatever  reason, perform the same test on the A9 prior to our closing the deal with  PG&E.  In any event, I realize that we have other issues to consider in our  approach to this, such as the finalization of the joint venture, under which  we have around $8 million at risk currently, and also that Principal  Investing is negotiating an equity position in PSM, so I will leave it up to  the commercial people as to how agressive we want to be.  Regardless, even if  we remove the last paragraph of the cover letter, I think that the point made  in the second paragraph regarding legal advice needs to remain.

H.R. 4541 passed the House 377-4 last evening and Enron strongly  supports the legislation (I will e-mail Ken Lay's letter to Chairman Combest  which expresses our support plus some talking points for your information.)   There is a real opportunity to enact this legislation this Congress.  The  last deal which needs to be cut is with Senator Gramm (he is the only  obstacle to enactment in the Senate.)  The ""Energy Provisions"" discussed in  this press release are NOT IN PLAY and will not be changed in the Senate.  It  is other provisions which do not directly affect Enron which are being  negotiated.  Contrary to this release's statement, no House member (other than one member  who didn't make it for the vote,Congressman Baker) is asking for changes in  the Senate.  The overwhelming numbers speak for themselves.  All and all,  this press release is outlandish.  This will be our highest priority next week and changes occur by the hour.   Please call if you do indeed get press calls and need our assistance.  Many  thanks.   EXCHANGE EXPRESSES OUTRAGE AT HOUSE PASSAGE OF H.R. 4541  NEW YORK, NY, October 20, 2000 -- In response to passage by the House of Representatives last night of H.R. 4541, the Commodity Futures Modernization Act of 2000, New York Mercantile Exchange Chairman Daniel Rappaport issued the following statement:        The New York Mercantile Exchange finds it particularly egregious that, by approving subsection (g) (3) of Section 106, the House would not only remove the energy and metals marketplaces from public scrutiny and regulatory oversight, but also do this in a fashion that discriminates between established markets versus start-up electronic forums.  It is particularly outrageous, at a time when every U.S. consumer is feeling the impact of high energy prices, to allow lobbying by a small group of vested interests to influence Congress to take these markets out of the public eye and create an advantage for people to trade on private, proprietary systems lacking the protections of a neutral self-regulatory organization. Policy makers, regulators, and the American public will be deprived of currently available information on market participation, concentration, and financial performance.  This is not only a matter of ill-conceived public policy but is also anti-competitive and directly contrary to the recommendations made by the President'sWorking Group on financial markets.  Even House members who voted in favor of the bill have been publicly quoted as saying that it must be changed in the Senate.  The New York Mercantile Exchange plans to fight adamantly at the Senate level to demand that this subsection either be eliminated or be amended to create a consistent regulatory policy for electronic and open outcry markets.  # # #     ----------------------------------  This e-mail is sent by a law firm and contains information that may be privileged and confidential.

You may be getting a call from JoAnne Pinkett regarding a proposal for future funding of the BEAR program.  There has apparently been some difficulty in communication between the BEAR board and our board.    Any proposal has to make its way through the Children's Services Committee then the Executive Committee.  It is then put before the whole board for a vote.  I thought that you would be an idea person to advise the BEAR representatives as to how to structure the proposal to the Children's Committee to ensure that it is given a fair and expeditious review and decision - a proposal that would be comprehensible to board members who are not directly involved with the BEAR program.  I also thought you could give this advice without having to commit a great deal of time (including travel time for meetings).  I think everyone agrees that it is a great program and that we should be supportive of such public-private partnerships.  There is probably some difference of opinion amongst the board as to how much support (and at what pace) we should give the program.  I would deeply appreciate your helping the BEAR folks make the clearest proposal possible.  I, for one, want this program to succeed.  As good as its current work is - I think it holds even greater potential for benefiting the children we serve.

It was through that  company that I developed a relationship with Enron and subsequently came to  work here in 1993.    Since coming to Enron, I have maintained regular contact and networks with  several of my former partners.  One of them, Barry Curtiss-Lusher, started up  his own oil and gas exploration and production company, Nexus Resources, in  Denver.  Barry has recently asked me to join his Board of Directors.

Currently, Nexus  does not pay any cash stipend to its Directors.  It does, however, compensate  Board members with Nexus stock.  Additionally, I would be making a minor  personal investment in Nexus stock.

"fyi. michelle has the kelly role at the end been discussed with you or are we  covered re consulting agreement??  Lisa J. Mellencamp Enron North America Corp. 1400 Smith St. Houston, TX  77002 Tel:  (713) 853-7986 Fax: (713) 646-3393 E-mail:  Lisa.Mellencamp@enron.com ----- Forwarded by Lisa Mellencamp/HOU/ECT on 10/25/2000 08:52 AM -----   Randal Maffett  10/24/2000 05:40 PM        To: jerrel@ecogas.com, jerrel@rmisp.com, Jeff Donahue/HOU/ECT@ECT, Andrea V  Reed/HOU/ECT@ECT    cc: sjham84@aol.com, kmahmoud@austin.rr.com, kelly.mahmoud@enron.com,  rstephens@bracepatt.com, Lisa Mellencamp/HOU/ECT@ECT    Subject: Status update  Selexol Plant - has been sold to Tanoma for $200K.  Wire transfer received  today.  I have called Montauk and informed them and withdrawn from further  negotiations with them.  FYI - we never accepted their offer. Austin PPA - was sold to EDI for $150K.  Wire transfer received yesterday. Steve and Geoff are pursuing the sale of the blower and flare from the Austin  project, potential $30K. Current cash projection (based solely on money in the bank) through the week  ending Nov. 3 is + $135K.  The rent for the Austin office for Oct has been  paid.  This number also includes $20K for Nov's rent (due 11/1).  This  provides some breathing room (time-wise) to continue trying to execute the  strategy of an orderly liquidation in order to maximize Ecogas' ability to  satisfy its obligations with its creditors.   Our meeting today with ZAPCO re: the purchase of the company via a stock swap  went ok but my confidence level a deal can be done in the timeframe required  is very low due to complications on their part.  We are exploring another  structural option - at ZAPCO's request.  The ball is in their court and they  know we are continuing to pursue other alternatives. Discussions with Inter-Asia Venture Management (IAVM) continue to both  progress and expand.  In addition to Rosenberg IAVM has expressed a direct  interest in Ecovest and McCommas.  Considering McCommas represents the bulk  of current value, IAVM has now elevated their interest to buying Ecogas Corp.  as a whole rather than on a piecemeal basis.  Again, the ball is in their  court and they are demonstrating a real sense of urgency to make something  happen.  They are well aware of the time constraints. Frito-Lay/McCommas Bluff - F/L senior management does not want to ""get into  the landfill energy business"" (at least directly) and brought in a third  party intermediary.  After detailed discussions and due diligence on their  part, the third party was not willing to put forth a formal offer.  Their  intermediary does not have the capital to close the deal and is not willing  to put his current assets at risk.  As a result, we have escalated  discussions with another entity who could provide the same interface with F/L  and whom would be acceptable by F/L.  This will also be dependent on the  probability of the IAVM and/or ZAPCO discussion referenced above. Skyline/Westside - a bid request package was sent out to approximately 8 or 9  industry participants with bids due 10/23.  To date only one company  responded with a very low bid and a lot of ""contingencies.""  There are at  least 2 other companies who called and expressed interest in bidding but have  not yet submitted their bids.  EDI has requested permission to visit with WMI  directly and get a read on the Gas Rights Agreements and their willingness to  work with them.  At this point, I don't think we should agree.  Depending on  how discussions with IAVM and/or ZAPCO progress, this will require a  judgement call as to whether or not we should proceed with this transaction.   Any input from the rest? FYI - Felipe Vega, the controller for Ecogas, has tendered his resignation  effective Monday, Oct. 30.  Kelly Mahmoud will assume the necessary role to  keep things in order.  Given the updates above, we are still pursuing parallel and simultaneous  paths of either selling the company outright or strategically liquidating  assets with our focus on McCommas Bluff.  Feel free to call if you have any  questions or would like to discuss in more detail.",mark.haedicke@enron.com,lisa.mellencamp@enron.com,Status update,2000-10-25 01:54:00-07:00,received

"Why wouldn't we use the EEI form in Ontario?  The markets will be integrated,  at least in part, into the US.  We could have an annex for Ontario.

Greg, Chris needs the Master form ASAP so we can take the lead on this  Ontario industry form development iniative.  Can you finalize the form and  prepare a bullet point memo as requested by Chris comparing the differences  between our form and EEI.  Greg, also you should coordinate a Calgary office meeting with traders and  originators (not more than 1 hour) to unveil and explain the form ASAP.   Alberta Market Opening and PPA trading commences Jan 1/01 and we may need  push to get Masters signed or rely on GTC in the short term.  Chris, you should do likewise in Toronto when appropriate.

The reason I ask is that I am going to be  involved in the industry push here in Ontario to develop a standard physical  bilateral agreement.  While it is my understanding that many participants  want to start with the EEI form and OPGI believes that they already have a  next to final form, for obvious reasons Peter and Milly would like to see our  form become the industry standard.  Another thing that would be helpful is a brief memo describing the  differences between the EEI form and our form and the rationale for the  differences.  Some of this may be readily apparent from running a blackline,  but I would like to have the benefit of the knowledge you have built up in  developing the form.    Timing of this is fairly tight as the next meeting on this initiative is  November 9th.  My goal is to show up at the meeting and advocate a  ""Canadianized"" version of the EEI form and then describe the great time and  effort Enron has expended on this already and table our draft as a starting  point.  Apparently EEI will also be in attendance.  I will follow up with Elizabeth  Sager on what is the status of our relationship with EEI and what was the US  experience in developing the EEI master.

"Mark:  Got your voice mail on this. I wasn't sure if you were suggesting the policy  for trading contracts or all contracts of greater than a year.  My thoughts are as follows:  1) Policy Scope: I think we need to address whether the Policy will extend to  trading as well as origination transactions. As you know, often there is a  very blurry line.  2) Existing Masters: If a master is in place, confirmations will be used for  terms of one month to greater than one year. I don't think it will be  practical for us to approve these confirmations before signature unless there  are material modifications done to the pre-approved confirmation template in  the master, which would require Legal approval in the present state of  affairs.  I assume the Policy would only apply to individually negotiated  contracts outside a Master Agreement.  3) Order of Magnitude: We should consider having a dollar figure (determined  simply by multiplying the notional or contract volume x the contract price or  the Enron financial commitment amount), coupled with the one year or greater  term, that would require the additional OGC/AGC approval in order to make  sure the requirement is imposed only for higher dollar contracts.

I believe we made some  progress yesterday on the overall look and feel of the site.   Meeting Notes:  Mark - Presented ideas for the look and feel of the web site based on law  firm web sites and intra-Enron sites.  I will continue to pursue work with  the IT group on the design and implementation of the site.  Michelle - Reported on her progress with the ENA PR group on a name.   click.legal or click.law seem to be the favorite addresses; however,  ""legalmatters.enron"" was also suggested.  Michelle will continue to work with  the ENA PR group to develop a name, possible logo and slogan/tag-line  consistent with the Enron vision statement.  Janette - Reported on the status of the organization chart information to be  used on the site.  Indicated she is still waiting for responses from several  of the groups for the ""who are we"" paragraph.  She is also making progress on  matching the org. chart to the individual legal team members.  Work on this  project will continue.  Ed/James - Both reported on the status of link identification.  Discussion  took place regarding the further identification of categories associated with  the links and those links that will be useful to the Department, realizing  that few clients will actual access our site for links.  Work on a listing of  categories and sites for these categories will continue.   General Information:  Subsequent to our meeting, I met with our designated IT project coordinator -  Tamika Hebert.  We spent almost two hours discussing the functionality we  want in the site.  Unfortunately, John Reese, our IT designer, was out of the  office and unable to provide me with the design ideas he has to date.  I hope  to receive these designs later today or tomorrow and will make them available  to everyone for comment.  I also provided Tamika with references to some of  the sites we reviewed during our meeting so that she could understand some of  the look, feel and functionality we want.  Concerning actual development of the background structure, the ""programmer""  has not been identified for this project, but should be by the end of this  week.  Once he/she is identified, work will begin on the design of the  functionality of the site.  Concurrent with this effort, it is necessary that  we start providing content to Tamika so that site areas can be tested and  reviewed.  Accordingly, once information is available in your respective  areas, please provide it to me or forward it directly to Tamika.  Reminder - Please remember to note that we have moved the time of the meeting  from 2:00 to 2:30.  Our next meeting will be next Wednesday, November 1 in  EB38C2.  Thanks again for the hard work.

EEI has called me and  stated that they want to attend a meeting on November 9th  in Ontario to  advocate the use of the EEI form in Canada.

"Joe Hartsoe, Rick Shapiro, or Jim Steffes can fill you in on the details of  what FERC did today.  One question you need to think about is how their  decision on price caps affects any contracts which we may have indexed to  California's spot market.  The way it reports the market clearing price will  change fundamentally if prices over 150 will be accepted but not used to  clear the market for all bids.  So, if we are using this as a reference price  in our contracts it may trigger the need to look for alternatives. ----- Forwarded by Steven J Kean/NA/Enron on 11/01/2000 03:39 PM -----   Ann M Schmidt  11/01/2000 10:37 AM        To: Mark Palmer/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Karen Denne/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Meredith  Philipp/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Steven J Kean/NA/Enron@Enron, Elizabeth  Linnell/NA/Enron@Enron, Eric Thode/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Laura  Schwartz/Corp/Enron@Enron, Jeannie Mandelker/HOU/ECT@ECT, Mary  Clark/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Damon Harvey/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT,  Keith Miceli/Corp/Enron@Enron, James D Steffes/NA/Enron@Enron, Richard  Shapiro/NA/Enron@Enron    cc:     Subject: USA: FACTBOX-FERC details changes for Calif power market.  USA: FACTBOX-FERC details changes for Calif power market.  11/01/2000 Reuters English News Service (C) Reuters Limited 2000.  WASHINGTON, Nov 1 (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission  on Wednesday approved several actions to revamp California's power market  over the next two years.  Immediate changes include the following: * Eliminate requirement that three utilities - Pacific Gas & Electric, San  Diego Power and SoCal Edison - must sell all of their power to and buy all  their power from the state Power Exchange (PX).  * Require market participants to schedule 95 percent of their transactions in  the day-ahead markets to reduce chronic underscheduling of load and  generation and over-reliance on the ISO's real-time imbalance market to meet  supply. FERC also proposed a penalty charge for scheduling deviations in  excess of 5 percent of hourly load requirements.  * Temporary modification of the single-price auction so bids above $150 MWh  cannot set the market clearing price paid to all bidders.  * Establish independent, non-stakeholder governing boards for the California  Power Exchange (PX) and Independent System Operator (ISO).  * Create congestion management design proposal.  * Establish generation inter-connection procedures.  * Explore alternatives to the single price auction by the ISO and PX.  * Develop market rules to ensure sufficient supply is available to meet load  and reserve requirements.  FERC also approved changes to protect wholesale customers from unreasonable  rates during the time it will take to adopt longer-term market remedies. The  following price mitigation measures will remain in effect until Dec. 31,  2002:  * Single-price auctions for all sales in the ISO and PX markets at or below  $150 MWh. The single price would be used for all load which clears below this  amount in the auction.  * If an auction does not clear below the $150 MWh level, suppliers who choose  to bid above $150 would be paid their price bid. In other words, the highest  bid of the day, if above $150 per MWh, would no longer be the clearing price  paid by all.  * Sellers receiving above $150 per MWh would be required to report their bids  to FERC on a weekly basis and provide certain cost information to the agency.  * The ISO and PX would be required to report monthly information on such  bids, allowing FERC to monitor competitive conditions and assure just and  reasonable rates. Sellers would be subject to potential refund liability but  no lower than their marginal or opportunity cost if FERC finds  non-competitive conditions. The potential refund liability would extend the  full 24 months it would take to implement the market reforms.  Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.

At the risk  of being bold,  I think the undercurrent of your note and your discussions  with Haedicke over the last couple of days is a matter of absolute control.   Ownership and passion are important characteristics of our best commercial  people but so is fostering a diversity of opinions and ideas.  With the back  and mid office,  the current Enron model is based upon scale and  standardization which generates tremendous operating leverage.  Further, it  helps us manage risk and is a board mandated control issue.   In the  long-run, it is actually less costly (ie) systems that don't work together,  less transferable human capital, un-managed legal risks, etc.   A lot of your points are very valid and Haedicke has never and never will get  in the way of managing commercial business; however, Mark, Wes, Sally, Beth  et al have a mandate to provide a flexible, scalable but standardized  delivery mechanism, that manages our risk across the broad empire.  Don't  quit protecting the business and your people; however, please help accomplish  some of these goals as well.  In short, I would like to keep the reporting structures the same.    Lets take the earliest opporunity to discuss this.

As you know, with the exception of Origination & Finance, all  other Canadian departments (Trading, Legal, Ops, Acctg, HR, Govt, & IT)  report directly to someone in Houston while having a dotted line to me.   In my mind, this is completely backwards (ie. it should be a solid line to  me, and a dotted line to their respective counterparts in Houston) for the  following reasons. First, performance feedback is not communicated to these  individuals in a timely manner if at all. Even when it is, more times than  not, it is perfunctory in nature. In fact, I think that feedback is given  somewhat reluctantly because the manager  in Houston has really no idea  whether the individual in Canada is doing a good job or not.   Second, it is sub-optimal. I seem to be spending more and more time dealing  with issues between the Canadian employee and their respective manager in  Houston. Many of these conversations revolve around my first point. Case and  point, we almost lost Laura Scott earlier this year because she was feeling  unappreciated and felt that her boss had no idea the hours/effort she was  putting in. And just yesterday, I had a very unsatisfactory phone call with  Mark Haedicke regarding Peter Keohane. The result - I now have a very  demotivated lawyer on my hands.  Third, it is costly. Having senior people fly up to Calgary/Toronto to ""stay  in the loop"" and to complete performance reviews is both costly from both a  dollar and time perspective.    Frankly, I'm not looking for more performance reviews to do, but I do think  its important that staff receive meaningful feedback in a timely fashion. I  know what these people do - I work with them every day. It is my job to lead,  inspire, and motivate but lately it feels like it is my job to liase between  Houston and the employee.  I would appreciate your thoughts on this.  Regards Milnthorp      ",mark.haedicke@enron.com,david.delainey@enron.com,Re: Reporting Structure,2000-11-03 00:31:00-08:00,received

Over the last  few days, the form of the paper pursuant to which Enron Canada will trade  physical power in Canada has been reviewed and (I think) finalized by legal  in Calgary and Houston and the commercial people in Calgary.  We have  determined that it is in the best interest of Enron to jointly promote the  Edison Electric Institute (EEI) form of master which, as I described in my  e-mail of yesterday, consists of a standardized base contract with an  amending section, much like the ISDA form of financial master.  However, as  the current form of the EEI master is a US document, containing many US  specific provisions that have no application in Canada, commercially it has  been identified as a concern that, with respect to counterparties that are  not sophisticated trading companies, selling a US document with a Canadian  addendum will be difficult if not impossible.  Therefore, we are going to proceed to finalize the form of ""industrial  master"" that I have drafted and sent out numerous times for review, a copy of  which I enclose in both a clean and black-lined version (black-lined to the  most recent draft distributed to you) in what I now believe is, in fact,  final form.  Our commercial people can use this form, together with the form  of GTC I distributed to most of you earlier today, to market power in Alberta  to counterparties who will not accept the EEI form.  We will immediately begin the process of supporting the use of the EEI form  in Canada but will propose that a Canadian form of base contract be agreed to  and implemented, thereby eliminating the problem of using a US document as  the base contract for Canadian transactions.  I will begin the process of  trying to create a first draft of this base contract which, other than with  respect to removing US references and incorporating specific Canadian  principles, will be identical to the US form.  I will also commence the  process of preparing what Enron believes the form of addendum to this  Canadian base contract should be.  Sorry for the lengthy e-mail, but I wanted to ensure that everyone was  completely up-to-date with the status and process.  I believe that this  solution will address everyone's concerns without jeopardizing commercial  transactions in Alberta.

These have been worked out over the past several  months by a task force of the US and UK governments, along with  representatives of industry (including Enron) and NGOs (including Amesty and  Human Rights Watch) under the auspices of Secretary fo State Albright and  Foreign Secretary Cook.  As a result, we really don't  have the ability to  change the text, which is fixed.   As you know, Enron is very concerned about human rights issues because of  their intrinsic value and their community relations impacts.These guidelines  would be in addition to the Human Rights Policy Statement the Enron board  adopted last year, which really do not touch on security matters as such. I  have sent this to each of your since your business units are those that have  the most extensive operations in the developing countries in which these  issues are of primary concern.  (I am separately collecting comments/concerns  from within EES and EECC.)  The Enron effort on this guideline project has been lead by Lauren Goldblatt  of the Corp. PR group. Lauren has run the attached drafts past Mike Hicks and  Pete Vandergam at Corp. Security for their views of whether this can be  implemented by Enron.  We as the legal department have been asked to express  our view on are the following:  (a) Are there any show stoppers that would argue that Enron should not  publicly express its ""endorsement"" of these polices? (b) If Enron were to express its endorsement of the policy statement, what if  any material problems do you think your business line might encounter in  implementing the policy? (c) Do you see any unintended practical or legal consequences that might  arise from Enron publicly adopting or endorsing this as policy?  Please take an hour few hours to read through the materials, or have one of  your lawyers do so. You might need to consult with your operation personnel  for their practical views as well.   I would be grateful if you could express  any concerns you may see with the guidelines by November 7 (Wednesday) so  that I can coordinate comments and get the responses out.   (The deadline for  Enron and other companies to express their endorsement of the policy has been  extended from the November 8 deadline expressed in the attached to November  15. To allow time for Enron to deal with responses, we have been asked to get  our feed back to Lauren by November 8 (Thursday).)  You cane-mail your comments or phone them to  me at 713-646-6309. If I get  suffucient expressions of interest for a conference call by Monday, I will  set up a call in number for Wednesday morning US.

USA: FACTBOX-FERC details changes for Calif power market.  11/01/2000 Reuters English News Service (C) Reuters Limited 2000.  WASHINGTON, Nov 1 (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission  on Wednesday approved several actions to revamp California's power market  over the next two years.  Immediate changes include the following: * Eliminate requirement that three utilities - Pacific Gas & Electric, San  Diego Power and SoCal Edison - must sell all of their power to and buy all  their power from the state Power Exchange (PX).  * Require market participants to schedule 95 percent of their transactions in  the day-ahead markets to reduce chronic underscheduling of load and  generation and over-reliance on the ISO's real-time imbalance market to meet  supply. FERC also proposed a penalty charge for scheduling deviations in  excess of 5 percent of hourly load requirements.  * Temporary modification of the single-price auction so bids above $150 MWh  cannot set the market clearing price paid to all bidders.  * Establish independent, non-stakeholder governing boards for the California  Power Exchange (PX) and Independent System Operator (ISO).  * Create congestion management design proposal.  * Establish generation inter-connection procedures.  * Explore alternatives to the single price auction by the ISO and PX.  * Develop market rules to ensure sufficient supply is available to meet load  and reserve requirements.  FERC also approved changes to protect wholesale customers from unreasonable  rates during the time it will take to adopt longer-term market remedies. The  following price mitigation measures will remain in effect until Dec. 31,  2002:  * Single-price auctions for all sales in the ISO and PX markets at or below  $150 MWh. The single price would be used for all load which clears below this  amount in the auction.  * If an auction does not clear below the $150 MWh level, suppliers who choose  to bid above $150 would be paid their price bid. In other words, the highest  bid of the day, if above $150 per MWh, would no longer be the clearing price  paid by all.  * Sellers receiving above $150 per MWh would be required to report their bids  to FERC on a weekly basis and provide certain cost information to the agency.  * The ISO and PX would be required to report monthly information on such  bids, allowing FERC to monitor competitive conditions and assure just and  reasonable rates. Sellers would be subject to potential refund liability but  no lower than their marginal or opportunity cost if FERC finds  non-competitive conditions. The potential refund liability would extend the  full 24 months it would take to implement the market reforms.  Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.

Rick  --------------- Forwarded by Rick Buy/HOU/ECT on 11/01/2000 02:11 PM  ---------------------------       From:  Rick L Carson                                                              11/01/2000 11:28 AM                                      To: Rick Buy/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: David Gorte/HOU/ECT@ECT, Bradford Larson/HOU/ECT@ECT, Don  Rollins/HOU/ECT@ECT  Subject: Cypress Exploration Program - Operator/Cash Call Issue      Rick:  I wanted to inform you about a situation where a Commercial Team has  subjected Enron to some material risk that did not get appropriate  approval.                  Here's the story:   On October 30, I received a funding request for my  approval of approximately $260,000 representing a cash advance request on   the Bernard No. 1 well, a 16,500 exploratory well in the Cypress Program.    The request appeared pretty routine but as is our procedure, I had Don  Rollins check it out .   Don discovered that we had already paid our cash  call and this cash call represented our working interest partner, Kelley  Oil's share, which is a highly unusual situation.  Checking further we  discovered that  the well is being drilled under a farmout agreement from  Kelley, who wanted to be operator.  Our guys (Thompson/Josey) wanted Enron  (not Kelley)  to operate the well during the drilling phase but did not want  to be official operator of record so they set up Rozel Onshore, our prospect  generator in Lafayette to be our surrogate operator.  Kelley was upset about  this and would not sign the Joint Venture Agreement unless the cash call  provisons were deleted.  Thompson/Josey and team agreed and signed the  agreement which has no initials from the Legal Department.   The effect of  this was that Rozel/Enron would have to incur all the costs then bill and  collect from Kelley.  Rick, as you are aware, the cash call provision in a JOA is the primary  credit risk mitigant that an operator has to ensure that his partners pay  their share of well costs before costs are incurred.  This can be  particularly good protection if a well gets in trouble with lots of cost  overruns that partners don't  want to pay.  In this case, our surrogate  operator, Rozel has no established credit with oil service companys and no  money of his own so all services including the drilling rig are having to be  prepaid by Enron 100%.  The well is heavily front end loaded with costs with  a total drill and complete exposure of over $4.0 million (if thing go ok!)  I discussed this with Dave Gorte and Brad Larson and we all agreed  that we  are forced to fund since the well is drilling and failure to fund would shut  down operations.   Also, keep in mind that this will be an ongoing obligation  (and risk exposure) during this entire drilling phase.  Lessons Learned:    1) The E&P merchant finance team has no business operating a deep S.  Louisiana exploratory test.    2)  Important provisions, like ""cash call"" should never be given away  without appropriate risk assessment and approval.  Please call if you have questions.

"I think this is a detrimental reliance case or fraud.  I want to be  aggressive on this.  Richard, please let me know what theory is best.  Do we  have counsel for Washington?  Mark     Christian Yoder  10/27/2000 12:15 PM        To: Elizabeth Sager/HOU/ECT@ECT, Mark Taylor/HOU/ECT@ECT, Richard B  Sanders/HOU/ECT@ECT, Mark E Haedicke/HOU/ECT@ECT    cc:     Subject: Puget Sound requests NW price caps  In the days immediately before the application for a price cap, Puget came to  us and asked us to enter into several put options.  We did so. I am advised  by the traders that if this price cap were to actually be in effect,  our put  option transactions would not make sense for us economically and we would  never have entered into them had we known of their intention to make this  filing.   I am under some pressure  to explain two things:  (i) whether the  fact that they knew they were going to file for the cap when they did the  options is some kind of fraud, and (ii) whether the WSPP Agreement or our  ISDA swap agreements have any clauses in them to address this kind of  thing,ie. is this some kind of ""illegality"" issue?  I am working on the  second issue and have discussed it with Mark Taylor, but on the first issue,  I need advice from Richard and anyone else who can help.----cgy  ---------------------- Forwarded by Christian Yoder/HOU/ECT on 10/27/2000  09:59 AM ---------------------------   Mary Hain 10/27/2000 09:50 AM To: James D Steffes/NA/Enron@Enron, Marcie Milner, Joe Hartsoe@Enron, Sarah  Novosel/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Richard Sanders, Christian Yoder/HOU/ECT@ECT,  Portland West Desk cc:   Subject: Puget Sound requests NW price caps  Puget Sound has filed a complaint against all jurisdictional sellers of  wholesale energy and/or capacity in the Pacific Northwest, including parties  to WSPP agreement.

<KSumme@isda.org>    Subject: Restructuring Meeting  Memo to Credit Derivatives Documentation Task Force: We have arranged for meetings of the Credit Derivatives Documentation Task Force to take place simultaneously in New York and London on Monday, November 13, at 9:30 NY time/2:30 London time. The New York meeting will take place at the offices of Chase Manhattan Bank, 270 Park Avenue, 11th Floor, Room C. The London meeting will take place at the offices of Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, 20 Cabot Square, Canary Wharf, London E14.  Please RSVP to Barbara Hanlon at bhanlon@isda.org indicating at which location you will be attending. At each meeting, I will arrange for several individuals to present their view on the Restructuring issue. There will then be an opportunity in each meeting to ask questions of those individuals and for more general discussion. We will then link the London and New York meetings by telephone to share views between the meetings.  This distribution list is drawn from participants in the documentation process. The Restructuring issue, while focused on a term in the documentation, is nevertheless one of market practice and not really one of documentation. We, therefore, encourage you to ensure that the views of your trading desk are expressed at the meeting, preferably by having someone from the desk at the meeting. We expect a large number of people at the meetings, however, so we also encourage you to consider who from your institution is most critical to be in attendance to ensure that your views are heard.  We look forward to hearing from you on the 13th.

What I believe he is  referring to is documentation of financial (gas or power transactions).   (i.e. All physical transactions, Confirms, GTC's, Masters, etc. are  documented out of Calgary, all with the proper controls.)  Honestly, I am not  clear on this point.  My understanding is that responsibility for financial  trading for Canada is with Mark Taylor.  i.e. I understand that Confirms  which do not require legal input have been moved to the Confirm group in  Calgary, but Confirms which require legal input, ISDA Masters with Canadian  counterparties, structured financial transactions, etc. remain with Mark  Taylor, and that Calgary Legal is not, generally speaking, responsible for  financial transactions.  I do not want to re-visit this issue, but merely  clarify any confusion so that I can get back to Milnthorp.  I know that  neither Greg Johnston, Mark Powell, Chris Gaffney nor I are seeing any  financial trades.

The methodology I used is as follows:     (1) We each ended up with one exhibition game.     (2) The two of you expressed a preference for weekend nights.  There are 12 Friday and Saturday games, so I gave each of you six.     (3)  I tried to give you games where you will not be out of town (although I ended up giving each of you one game where both of you will be out of town).     (4) I divided the teams into good teams (Trailblazers, Jazz, Heat, Spurs, Lakers,  Knicks, Pacers and Sonics), medium teams (Timberwolves, Hornets, Kings, 76ers, Cavaliers, Suns, Celtics and Nets) and bad teams (Bulls, Pistons, Grizzlies, Wizards, Magic, Clippers, Mavericks, Bucks, Nuggets, Warriors, Raptors and Hawks), and I tried to divide the teams so that there was a realtively even distribution of team levels. Mark ended up with 5-7-6, Rob with 6-3-9 and I ended up with 2-1-2.  Although Rob has one more good team than Mark has, he get to see more dogs.  I am not 100% certain that I have a good handle on whose going to be good, mediocre and bad, and there were some teams that might be bad but I put in a medium category because they are interesting (e.g. 76ers, Celtics and Nets).     (5) Finally, I attempted to minimize the repeats.  But it ended up that Mark has the Timberwolves and Grizzlies  twice, and Rob has the Warriors and Nuggets twice.     And, of course, if you don't like what I did you can always trade.        This was a highly scientific process, done with the aid of Lotus 1-2-3.

As a result, we really don't  have the ability to  change the text, which is fixed.   As you know, Enron is very concerned about human rights issues because of  their intrinsic value and their community relations impacts.These guidelines  would be in addition to the Human Rights Policy Statement the Enron board  adopted last year, which really do not touch on security matters as such. I  have sent this to each of your since your business units are those that have  the most extensive operations in the developing countries in which these  issues are of primary concern.  (I am separately collecting comments/concerns  from within EES and EECC.)  The Enron effort on this guideline project has been lead by Lauren Goldblatt  of the Corp. PR group. Lauren has run the attached drafts past Mike Hicks and  Pete Vandergam at Corp. Security for their views of whether this can be  implemented by Enron.  We as the legal department have been asked to express  our view on are the following:  (a) Are there any show stoppers that would argue that Enron should not  publicly express its ""endorsement"" of these polices? (b) If Enron were to express its endorsement of the policy statement, what if  any material problems do you think your business line might encounter in  implementing the policy? (c) Do you see any unintended practical or legal consequences that might  arise from Enron publicly adopting or endorsing this as policy?  Please take an hour few hours to read through the materials, or have one of  your lawyers do so. You might need to consult with your operation personnel  for their practical views as well.   I would be grateful if you could express  any concerns you may see with the guidelines by November 7 (Wednesday) so  that I can coordinate comments and get the responses out.   (The deadline for  Enron and other companies to express their endorsement of the policy has been  extended from the November 8 deadline expressed in the attached to November  15. To allow time for Enron to deal with responses, we have been asked to get  our feed back to Lauren by November 8 (Thursday).)  You cane-mail your comments or phone them to  me at 713-646-6309. If I get  suffucient expressions of interest for a conference call by Monday, I will  set up a call in number for Wednesday morning US.

As you know, Enron is very concerned about human rights issues because of  their intrinsic value and their community relations impacts.These guidelines  would be in addition to the Human Rights Policy Statement the Enron board  adopted last year, which really do not touch on security matters as such. I  have sent this to each of your since your business units are those that have  the most extensive operations in the developing countries in which these  issues are of primary concern.  (I am separately collecting comments/concerns  from within EES and EECC.)  The Enron effort on this guideline project has been lead by Lauren Goldblatt  of the Corp. PR group. Lauren has run the attached drafts past Mike Hicks and  Pete Vandergam at Corp. Security for their views of whether this can be  implemented by Enron.  We as the legal department have been asked to express  our view on are the following:  (a) Are there any show stoppers that would argue that Enron should not  publicly express its ""endorsement"" of these polices? (b) If Enron were to express its endorsement of the policy statement, what if  any material problems do you think your business line might encounter in  implementing the policy? (c) Do you see any unintended practical or legal consequences that might  arise from Enron publicly adopting or endorsing this as policy?  Please take an hour few hours to read through the materials, or have one of  your lawyers do so. You might need to consult with your operation personnel  for their practical views as well.   I would be grateful if you could express  any concerns you may see with the guidelines by November 7 (Wednesday) so  that I can coordinate comments and get the responses out.   (The deadline for  Enron and other companies to express their endorsement of the policy has been  extended from the November 8 deadline expressed in the attached to November  15. To allow time for Enron to deal with responses, we have been asked to get  our feed back to Lauren by November 8 (Thursday).)  You cane-mail your comments or phone them to  me at 713-646-6309. If I get  suffucient expressions of interest for a conference call by Monday, I will  set up a call in number for Wednesday morning US.

"Mark, Rob Milnthorp has asked me to consider whether there is an artful way  under our Master Agreements that upon certain occurrences we could elevate  our exposure from unsecured to secured, particularly in circumstances where,  for whatever reason, we have not received letters of credit or other  collateral.  My thought is to insert a clause in our Master Agreements in the  nature of a ""floating charge"".  The problem with this concept is that it may be resisted within the  industry.  For example, certain counterparties, i.e. a financial institution  or a near-financial institution, such as a bank, a brokerage, a trading  institution, etc., would not likely be willing to provide us with security  over their assets.  In general, counterparties will also have concerns with  granting security over their assets, particularly as that security may have  restricting consequences for their treasury/banking relationships and  covenants, and/or on their ability to conduct business, including disposing  of assets which may then require our consent.  In addition, it would likely  be necessary to introduce this concept on a bilateral basis, such that it  would also be binding on us in similar circumstances.  (Counterparties could  go so far as requiring this concept in our Enron Corp. guarantees.)  For example, in the natural gas business in Canada at least, older form  marketing agreements and agreements used by gas aggregators with gas  producers used ""reserved dedication"" covenants, whereby reserves were  dedicated to a particular contract.  These covenants did not, however, create  security, to avoid the complicating issues addressed above.  To the extent  that the reserves were not available, the marketer/aggregator could have a  claim, on an unsecured basis, for breach of covenant, but was not in a  secured position.  I do not believe we want to go to this type of concept.  However, we may be able to think of some creative way whereby the  counterparty is free to deal with us (and we are free to deal with them) on  an unsecured basis, subject to our standard collateralization requirements,  but also provide that upon the occurrence of a particularly serious event,  such as a Material Adverse Change, a Triggering Event, an Event of Default,  etc., the security automatically takes place.  We would need to consider  whether such a ""prospective"" security interest could be made to work and be  enforceable.  I have discussed this concept on a preliminary basis with Rob Milnthorp and  Mungo Hardwicke-Brown of the Blake firm to see if we could create a  relatively simple clause to be inserted into our Master Agreements which  artfully deals with this issue.  In essence, the idea would be to get  ourselves in a position of being one step ahead of all of the unsecured  creditors in the event there is an insolvency.  Would you please let me know whether you think this is a worthwhile project  or whether we have considered such a thing in the past in Houston.  As noted  above, the clause would have to be one that could be ""sold"" to counterparties  and be acceptable to us on a bilateral basis (and that may well not be  possible).  If you believe that it is a worthwhile project, I will continue  to work with Mungo Hardwicke-Brown to see if we can come up with something.   If you do not believe that it is a worthwhile project or have considered this  idea in the past and found it to be unworkable, please let me know, and we  will not work on it further.

Enron's senior staff meeting on Monday has been created as the primary forum  to discuss and promote the commercial initiatives of our entire operations.   These meetings are mandatory for all Director and equivalent level staff  within the organisation across all Enron companies in Australia.  The  meetings will be held in the boardroom at 4.30PM on each Monday (or Tuesday  in case of holiday).  Accordingly, I encourage you to avoid scheduling any  conflicts with this timing. The first meeting will be held on Monday 30 October.  David Minns will play a central role to the coordination of the commercial  activities of this group.  Please supply David with a list of your group's  major deal initiatives should you intend to be absent from this meeting.  In  David's absence please provide me with this list should you be unable to  attend this meeting in person or not be in a position to dial in to the  meeting.   In addition, Heidi Mason will assume greater responsibility for coordinating  support resources throughout office.  All administrative staff will report to  Heidi in addition to their current direct report.  The assumption of greater coordinating responsibility for David and Heidi is  designed to maximise the amount of effort each Director is expending on  direct commercial activities as well as increasing efforts to maximise  existing resources and cross-commodity deal opportunities.  A general office email will be sent advising of this initiative.  This email  will also incorporate explicit comment on reporting and expense obligations.

Mark -  I work in the middle market group in the Portland West Power Group.  I feel  that this year there have been some issues regarding turning around certain  legal financial tasks.  A good example to look at is the SMUD ISDA contract.   This counterparty transacted with our weather desk in a breakthrough deal  that began in October.  Both Enron and SMUD are still struggling to sign the  ISDA.  Part of the reason for the delay in signing was the difficulty I had  in getting someone in legal to get the process going before the deal  transacted.  I probably began speaking with someone (I think is was Sara) at  least several months prior to the closing of the deal but never made any  progress.  Ultimately I got frustrated and left the process to Gary Taylor in  the weather group to deal with (I was merely supporting him since I had a  relationship with SMUD).    Although I historically felt Sara Shackelton was the west power contact for  such matters she seems overwhelmed with many other groups needs.  I am  interested in one contact for our group that can turn things around in a  timely manner.  I think from what I heard from other in my group that my  opinion is commonly shared.  I have tired to bring this issue up with Mark  Taylor since early September yet after trying to call him several times and  sending two emails I have given up trying to contact him (this seems ironic  given the subject I wanted to discuss with him).    I would welcome any insight you can provide.  One thought I had was to have a  lawyer who represents both financial and physical issues (Shari Stack seems  to be qualified to represent both sides and she works for the West).  My  group has become used to speedy reponse on the physical side and perhaps has  high expectations on all legal matter.  You can reach me at 503-464-3810.   Thanks.

"Mark:  I spoke briefly to Steve Pruett this past week regarding the Cypress JOA cash  call issue that you had inquired about.   As I mentioned in my voicemail to  you, I was not aware of the farmout arrangement or JOA with Kelley and had  not been asked to review the farmout agreement or the JOA.  I obtained copies  of the documents and asked Steve to fill me in on how the situation  developed.  Steve was out of the office much of last week; he followed up  Friday with the attached email message.   As Steve mentions in his email, there were extenuating circumstances and  timing issues, but certainly it was a mistake for a rig to be moved and a  well spudded without agreements in place and for documents to be signed  without appropriate review and approval.  I understand that John Thompson and  Steve made the decision to move the rig and spud the well when they had a  term sheet and draft agreement that they anticipated being able to sign in  short order.   Allen Wilhite and I frequently work together to get  documentation finalized and in form for Steve's execution.  From Steve's  reaction when I told him I had not reviewed or initialled the farmout (which  had been initialled by Allen), I believe he had assumed that had been the  case in this situation as well, although he did not try to place  responsibility on Allen.  Steve is one of the best and the brightest I've worked with at Enron.  He is  extremely busy, working very hard to manage the portfolio of existing E & P  assets, as well as working on new deals.  I have worked with Steve enough to  know that he would never have intentionally failed to follow our procedures.   I think this incident was a mistake that will not be repeated.  I will remind  the ECR group at Monday's staff meeting that review by the legal department  is required before any agreements are signed.  Where do we go from here?  Would you like for me to arrange a meeting with  Steve?  Please let me know if there is anything further you would like for me  to do.   Steve raises the issue of staffing in his email.  In light of the level of  activity for new ECR deals, time that is required in assisting Global Finance  with Condor and a funding vehicle for the VPPs, and the increased legal time  required as Bonne Terre, Cypress, and Vastar are no longer managed by third  parties, being able to provide quality and timely legal advice is  increasingly difficult, and staffing is an issue that I hope can be addressed  soon.

The circumstances of the event follow to  the best of my knowledge, without confirming with Allen Wilhite who is  presently inaccessible:  Rozel Energy, led by Bill Rogers, identified a high potential / relatively  low risk prospect in late August on acreage held by Kelley Oil & Gas (sub of  Contour Energy).  He commissioned a lease check and found that Kelley  controlled 90%+ of the acreage, but it was set to expire on Sept. 28, 2000.  Rozel, after reviewing the prospect with ECR technical personnel and  receiving approval to do so, sought to acquire top leases over the prospect  only to find that others had already top-leased a significant portion of the  prospect.  Had the Kelley lease expired, these parties would have controlled  and drilled the prospect.  Rozel, with the help of Allen Wilhite, approached Kelley for a farmout.   Kelley asked to be presented with a prospect review under the concept that  Kelley would be willing to farmout approximately 50% of its interest, or  farmout all of its interest retaining an ORRI convertible to a WI APO or  higher ORRI at its option.  Kelley elected to participate for 50% of its interest in the well before the  farmout agreement was drafted.  Kelley agreed to general terms in a brief  letter agreement.  Kelley sought to operate the well, which ECR rejected due  to Kelley's poor track record in drilling deep S. Louisiana wells.  Rozel  Energy is the operator in absence of Enron having an operating vehicle.   Rozel employed a seasoned contract operator in S. Louisiana, Stokes and  Speiler, who are being managed daily by Arvel Martin and Bob Devine, who each  have over 25 years experience in mangement of drilling operations.  Inasmuch as the operation of the well was in dispute, the negotiation of the  JOA and the farmout agreement was strained and Kelley was non-responsive to  Allen's efforts to finalize the agreement.  Allen, Craig Fox, Arvel Martin  and I met with Kelley's Land Manager and VP of Operations and established a  dialogue and rapport (we thought).  The initial draft of the farmout  agreement was put together on Sept. 15th by Kelley and Allen.  Allen did not  share the draft with you then as we were still apart on certain deal  provisions, particularly who would operate.  ECR members were in dispute over  the importance of operations.  With Kelley's consent and our high level of confidence that we would reach  terms with Kelley, we moved our rig in and spudded the well a few days prior  to the Sept. 28th lease expiration.  Allen and I continued to be frustrated  with not reaching final contract terms with Kelley after the well was  spudded.  I pressed Allen to finalize an agreement and he presented an  agreement signed by Kelley on October 16, 2000 (effective Sept. 15, 2000).    Following my signature and upon his departure to Kelley's offices to deliver  the document, I asked him if you had reviewed JOA and he said no.  I asked  him if it was required or customary for Legal to review JOAs, and he said it  was sometimes done but there are rarely revisions.  I did not ask  specifically about farmout agreements.  The Kelley farmout was the first  farmout in a directly-owned asset that I had encountered.  I failed to  recognize the distinction between numerous farmouts that I had seen executed  by our GP's in our Juniper, Bonne Terre (historically) and Texland ventures,  and a farmout with Enron's name on the line.  It is my job as a Vice President to know what requires Legal review.  I have  been made aware that farmout agreements and JOA's in directly owned assets  (as opposed to LP's with a GP such as Juniper) require Legal review and  signoff.  The compliance meeting last week underscored that point.  We had  outside counsel (Lisa Jaubert) under your direction review the Tri-C and  Manti farmout agreements and your initials are evidence of your approval.   I respect you as an attorney and business partner and commit that I will be  diligent about obtaining your review of agreements and ask you when in doubt  as to whether legal review and approval is required on a particular item or  issue.  The demands that our large oil & gas exploration portfolio places on you is  another issue that we should discuss.  The Bonne Terre, Cypress and Vastar  ventures have significant drilling activity that has commenced and will  continue.  Dissolution of Bonne Terre and distribution of the assets to ENA  (to be held in BT Exploration LLC) will increase the legal and commercial  activity level.  We have another prospect in Cypress that is being promoted  and will be spudded in the next 10 days, so expect to see a farmout agreement  on the S. Riceville prospect late next week.  I would be pleased to discuss these matters with you and Mark Haedicke in  person if you desire.  I regret my failure to obtain your review and approval  of the Kelley farmout agreement and commit to preventing a repeat of the  mistake.  I am concerned about the pace of agreements that we face in the  immediate future on our direct-owned ventures.   I look forward to working  with you on ways to better manage our business process in Cypress-Acadian,  Bonne Terre & Vastar ventures.

"Mark:  As I mentioned in my voice mail to you last Saturday, in addition to the  choice of Mexican law, there is another outstanding issue that may result in  increased risk to Enron Corp.  I did not go into detail on this issue this  morning when we spoke because discussions are still ongoing relative to the  issue and I sensed that you had a very limited amount of time available.  The  issue has not yet been resolved and I want to assure that you are aware of  the issue before I leave the office for the holiday.  Enron Corp. will provide a letter of credit to Pemex as required under the  Fuel Supply Agreement.  The letter of credit will be in an amount equal to  150% of two months of estimated gas purchases under the Fuel Supply  Agreement.  The lenders have required that Enron Corp. evidence in writing  its commitment to provide such letter of credit and, therefore, a FSA Credit  Support Agreement (the ""FSA Support"") is currently under negotiation.  The following issue arises under the repayment mechanism currently set forth  in FSA Support and, therefore, it is possible that it may become moot when  the negotiations relative to the FSA Support are concluded.  The repayment mechanism for the fuel supply letter of credit states that  Enron Energia Industrial de Mexico, S. de R.L. de C.V. (""EEIM"") will  reimburse Enron Corp. for any disbursements made under the letter of credit.   This mechanism may subject Enron Corp. to the risk that, after repayment by  EEIM to Enron Corp. of an outstanding debt resulting from EEIM's  reimbursement obligation and the resulting reinstatement of the letter of  credit, the repayment by EEIM could be withdrawn as a preferential payment if  EEIM went into bankruptcy.  In such event, Enron Corp. would be in the  situation of having an outstanding letter of credit and an unpaid  reimbursement obligation.   To reiterate, the FSA Support is still under negotiation but such  negotiations must be concluded before the lenders will close.  I will request  that Robert Stephens, the Bracewell Patterson attorney working on the FSA  Support, keep you updated on the status of this issue in my absence.  Robert  will be in Washington, D.C., through Wednesday.

Here's the story:   On October 30, I received a funding request for my  approval of approximately $260,000 representing a cash advance request on   the Bernard No. 1 well, a 16,500 exploratory well in the Cypress Program.    The request appeared pretty routine but as is our procedure, I had Don  Rollins check it out .   Don discovered that we had already paid our cash  call and this cash call represented our working interest partner, Kelley  Oil's share, which is a highly unusual situation.  Checking further we  discovered that  the well is being drilled under a farmout agreement from  Kelley, who wanted to be operator.  Our guys (Thompson/Josey) wanted Enron  (not Kelley)  to operate the well during the drilling phase but did not want  to be official operator of record so they set up Rozel Onshore, our prospect  generator in Lafayette to be our surrogate operator.  Kelley was upset about  this and would not sign the Joint Venture Agreement unless the cash call  provisons were deleted.  Thompson/Josey and team agreed and signed the  agreement which has no initials from the Legal Department.   The effect of  this was that Rozel/Enron would have to incur all the costs then bill and  collect from Kelley.  Rick, as you are aware, the cash call provision in a JOA is the primary  credit risk mitigant that an operator has to ensure that his partners pay  their share of well costs before costs are incurred.  This can be  particularly good protection if a well gets in trouble with lots of cost  overruns that partners don't  want to pay.  In this case, our surrogate  operator, Rozel has no established credit with oil service companys and no  money of his own so all services including the drilling rig are having to be  prepaid by Enron 100%.  The well is heavily front end loaded with costs with  a total drill and complete exposure of over $4.0 million (if thing go ok!)  I discussed this with Dave Gorte and Brad Larson and we all agreed  that we  are forced to fund since the well is drilling and failure to fund would shut  down operations.   Also, keep in mind that this will be an ongoing obligation  (and risk exposure) during this entire drilling phase.  Lessons Learned:    1) The E&P merchant finance team has no business operating a deep S.  Louisiana exploratory test.    2)  Important provisions, like ""cash call"" should never be given away  without appropriate risk assessment and approval.  Please call if you have questions.

"Mark, as I have mentioned to you the Plan B Alberta Power Auction is  scheduled for Nov 29/00, under which Enron Canada can purchase for one-year  terms, in each of three successive years, up to approximately 300MW/year #1;   130MW/year #2; and 65MW/year #3, of the unsold PPA capacity that reverted  back to the Balancing Pool of Alberta following the first auction last  August.  The bid qualification documentation needs to be in Friday and US  Thanksgiving is Thursday/Friday.  I wanted you to be aware of this, and  determine from you if any corporate approvals need to be obtained.  Firstly, Derek Davies/John Zufferli will only be bidding to the extent  authorized by Lavo.  Secondly, bid qualification commits us to the rules of the auction, the forms  of documentation to govern both the auction and the purchase if we are  successful, and requires a bid deposit (approximately C$6.5MM), but does not  obligate us to bid and, provided we comply with the auction rules, the Bid  Deposit will be returned after the auction.  Thirdly, unlike the PPA auction the risks are much less significant in terms  of volume and term.  In terms of documentation, if we are the successful  bidder, we will be buying power from the Balancing Pool under a physical  Master, which seems to be a Canadianized version of the EEI Master and which,  although not entirely to our liking, is generally satisfactory.  Fourthly, the position will, I understand, be managed in the power trading  book within approved position limits.  Note:  The nominal amounts owing (i.e.  no up front payment is required) on an unhedged basis for the entire 300MWs  in year #1 would be something like C$260MM, assuming a C$100/MW purchase  price.  Year #2 would be C$114MM and year #3 would be C$57MM.  Given the nature of the transaction, the short time that we have with US  Thanksgiving intervening, and numerous other demands, I do not believe that a  DASH, Risk Memo and/or Board Approval is necessary, but please let me know.  I will leave you a brief voice mail to follow-up.  Peter.",mark.haedicke@enron.com,peter.keohane@enron.com,Plan B Auction - Need for Approvals ?,2000-11-21 10:38:00-08:00,received

"Mark, thanks for the voice mail.  In terms of a risk memo, I agree that one  should not be necessary as in many respects this can be characterized as  normal course trading within position limits under a standardized Master  Agreement and without an outlay of capital, but hopefully the following  (together with my memo from last night - copy attached) suffices to the  extent a risk memo is required.  In terms of unusual risks:  1.  We do not have any rights to collateral under the proposed Master.   However, the counterparty is the Balancing Pool which is essentially  Government of Alberta credit risk.  Derek Davies is I believe dealing with  Credit to resolve credit issues.  In fact, I believe the Balancing Pool is  taking significant risk as it is selling the power firm under a Master which  does not match up to the interruptible nature of the PPAs it holds.  2.  The Balancing Pool will be secured under the Master by a parental  guarantee of Enron Corp. and has a somewhat discretionary right to call for  collateral from us under the Master if there is a material change in Enron  Corp.'s creditworthiness.  3.  It is a requirement of the auction that we will have entered into  back-to-back physical hedges for 70% of the volume we acquire, and we are  currently working at putting those deals in place conditional on us bidding  and being successful in the auction.  Penalties can be imposed if 70% of the  volume purchased is not properly hedged.  4.  As we are dealing with the Government of Alberta, we always run the risk  (as we are somewhat seeing now with respect to the Sundance PPA we acquired  in the first auction) that they can change the auction rules, the market  rules or the legislation in ways that are adverse to us.  In terms of the  auction rules, as with the first auction, they could be better drafted, but  our fundamental concern will be to make sure that it is clear that if we post  a bid deposit and do not bid that we get the deposit back, and to ensure that  the rules are clear enough that we are comfortable that we are in complete  control of whether or not we can comply with the rules.

Mark, as I have mentioned to you the Plan B Alberta Power Auction is  scheduled for Nov 29/00, under which Enron Canada can purchase for one-year  terms, in each of three successive years, up to approximately 300MW/year #1;   130MW/year #2; and 65MW/year #3, of the unsold PPA capacity that reverted  back to the Balancing Pool of Alberta following the first auction last  August.  The bid qualification documentation needs to be in Friday and US  Thanksgiving is Thursday/Friday.  I wanted you to be aware of this, and  determine from you if any corporate approvals need to be obtained.  Firstly, Derek Davies/John Zufferli will only be bidding to the extent  authorized by Lavo.  Secondly, bid qualification commits us to the rules of the auction, the forms  of documentation to govern both the auction and the purchase if we are  successful, and requires a bid deposit (approximately C$6.5MM), but does not  obligate us to bid and, provided we comply with the auction rules, the Bid  Deposit will be returned after the auction.  Thirdly, unlike the PPA auction the risks are much less significant in terms  of volume and term.  In terms of documentation, if we are the successful  bidder, we will be buying power from the Balancing Pool under a physical  Master, which seems to be a Canadianized version of the EEI Master and which,  although not entirely to our liking, is generally satisfactory.  Fourthly, the position will, I understand, be managed in the power trading  book within approved position limits.  Note:  The nominal amounts owing (i.e.  no up front payment is required) on an unhedged basis for the entire 300MWs  in year #1 would be something like C$260MM, assuming a C$100/MW purchase  price.  Year #2 would be C$114MM and year #3 would be C$57MM.  Given the nature of the transaction, the short time that we have with US  Thanksgiving intervening, and numerous other demands, I do not believe that a  DASH, Risk Memo and/or Board Approval is necessary, but please let me know.

Mark, thanks for the voice mail.  In terms of a risk memo, I agree that one  should not be necessary as in many respects this can be characterized as  normal course trading within position limits under a standardized Master  Agreement and without an outlay of capital, but hopefully the following  (together with my memo from last night - copy attached) suffices to the  extent a risk memo is required.  In terms of unusual risks:  1.  We do not have any rights to collateral under the proposed Master.   However, the counterparty is the Balancing Pool which is essentially  Government of Alberta credit risk.  Derek Davies is I believe dealing with  Credit to resolve credit issues.  In fact, I believe the Balancing Pool is  taking significant risk as it is selling the power firm under a Master which  does not match up to the interruptible nature of the PPAs it holds.  2.  The Balancing Pool will be secured under the Master by a parental  guarantee of Enron Corp. and has a somewhat discretionary right to call for  collateral from us under the Master if there is a material change in Enron  Corp.'s creditworthiness.  3.  It is a requirement of the auction that we will have entered into  back-to-back physical hedges for 70% of the volume we acquire, and we are  currently working at putting those deals in place conditional on us bidding  and being successful in the auction.  Penalties can be imposed if 70% of the  volume purchased is not properly hedged.  4.  As we are dealing with the Government of Alberta, we always run the risk  (as we are somewhat seeing now with respect to the Sundance PPA we acquired  in the first auction) that they can change the auction rules, the market  rules or the legislation in ways that are adverse to us.  In terms of the  auction rules, as with the first auction, they could be better drafted, but  our fundamental concern will be to make sure that it is clear that if we post  a bid deposit and do not bid that we get the deposit back, and to ensure that  the rules are clear enough that we are comfortable that we are in complete  control of whether or not we can comply with the rules.

"Please review this memo and leave me a voice mail on the status.  Are we  making changes suggested by our Mexican lawyers?  Mark ----- Forwarded by Mark E Haedicke/HOU/ECT on 11/22/2000 12:10 PM -----   ""Weiland, William"" <wweiland@velaw.com>  11/21/2000 03:29 PM        To: ""'Haedicke, Mark E.'"" <Mark.E.Haedicke@enron.com>    cc: ""'Banczak, Peggy J.'"" <Peggy.Banczak@enron.com>, ""Dilg, Joe""  <jdilg@velaw.com>    Subject: Choice of Mexican Law - Vitro/Monterrey Project  Peggy Banczak called me yesterday to say that the Inter-American Development Bank (""IADB"") had indicated its refusal to fund its loan to the appropriate ENE borrower in connection with the Enron-Vitro Monterry Cogeneration Project (""Project"") unless the PPA(s) (and construction contracts?), i.e., those contracts to be concluded between Mexican entities and calling for performance in Mexico, be governed by Mexican law.  Peggy explained that after long negotiation, ENE had been able to convince Vitro and Cementos Apasco (and other power purchasers/construction companies?) to agree that their contracts be governed by New York law but that despite this great success, IADB now for policy reasons was insisting that those contracts be governed by Mexican law.  Peggy and I talked with Rogelio Lopez-Velarde and Peggy subsequently provided me copies of three memoranda dated August 15, September 18 and September 27, 2000, addressed to Peggy and Robert Stephens of Bracewell & Patterson from Rogelio Lopez-Velarde and Amanada Valdez.  In the August 15, 2000, memorandum Rogelio and Ms. Valdez analyzed the enforceability of certain of the provisions of the PPA between Enron Energia Industrial de Mexico, S. de R.L. de C.V. and Apasco should that agreement be governed by Mexican law.  They recommended certain changes be made if the agreement were to be governed by Mexican law.  In the September 18, 2000, memorandum Rogelio and Ms. Valdez gave their opinion on the enforceability of the ""Suspension Remedy"" contained in Section 13.5 of the PPA.  In their memorandum of September 27, 2000, they opined principally that the provision of Section 13.6 of the PPA specifically denying each ""Capacity User"" the right to terminate the PPA except in the case of a ""Producer Event of Default under Section 132(a) (sic) has occurred and the Project has been Abandoned"" was unenforceable.  I have reviewed the three memoranda but I have not reviewed the PPA nor any of the other underlying Project documents.  As Joe Dilg mentioned to you before we undertook last week our limited review of the Enron-Vitro Amparo matter, we are not Mexican lawyers and therefore we cannot opine on the Lopez Velarde, Heftye, Abogados memoranda and opinions referenced above and we cannot opine on how the application of Mexican law to disputes that could arise under agreements the IADB now insists be governed by Mexican law might affect the enforceability of provisions of those agreements or the agreements themselves.    I consider the memoranda provided by the Lopez Velarde, Heftye, Abogados firm, however, to be well reasoned and written.  As I have not seen the underlying documents, I am not able to determine whether the August 15, 2000, memorandum addresses all of what the drafters characterize as the ""Challengeable Clauses"" in the PPA in Section I.2.A.  My guess is that the form from which the PPA has been developed is a form that ENE has used on other occasions in circumstances that would permit the agreements to be governed by laws of jurisdictions that have experience considering sophisticated commercial disputes at a minimum and perhaps disputes specifically arising under power purchase agreements.  If ENE does agree to subject interpretation of the PPA and other affected contracts to Mexican law, it would be worthwhile to again review the PPA and other affected agreements to be absolutely sure that all of the ""Challengable Clauses"" are identified and either changed in a manner acceptable to ENE to make them enforceable or if not changed that the risks of leaving the provisions ""as is""  are fully understood and evaluated by ENE.  I do have the following specific comments concerning the August 15, 2000, memorandum:     1.   If they already have not been made, is it possible still to convince the Mexican counter parties to make the changes Lopez Velarde, Hefty, Abogados have suggested?  Based on the Lopez Velarde, Hefty, Abogados memos, it seems to me that  ENE, as a condition to agreeing to accept Mexican law as the governing law, would want to negotiate at least the material changes to the PPA suggested by the Lopez Velarde, Heftye, Abogados firm in the memoranda.     2.   If it is not possible to negotiate the changes or is possible only to negotiate some of the changes, with respect to the ""Discretionary Performance Prohibition"" and the ""Discretionary Condition Prohibition"" outlined in Sections I.1.1 A. and B, would only the specifically applicable Performance or Condition provision be rendered unenforceable or could the PPA in its entirety be deemed unenforceable if either ""performance of portions of the PPA [as opposed to performance of the entire agreement] are left to the unilateral discretion of one of the parties."" or ""compliance with some [as opposed to all] [of the conditions] rests exclusively in the discretion of the obligor...""?        Are there any Performance or Condition Prohibitions that individually could be deemed to render unenforceable the entire PPA?        If there are a number of Performance or Condition Prohibitions that are not amended, could they in the aggregate be deemed sufficient to render undenforecable the entire PPA?     3.   Is there any other Challengable Clause or other clause in the PPA or other affected agreement that without modification to make enforceable should cause ENE not to entier into the PPA or other affected agreement ?     4.   Do the Discretionary Performance or Discretionary Condition Prohibitions constitute events of default, even if the party in whose favor they run do not attempt to enforce them, constitute an event of default that would afford the ""innocent party""  the right to demand rescission of the PPA?  I understand that the PPA and the affected contracts all contain dispute resolution provisions that would subject disputes to international arbitration.    Assuming that the dispute resolution provisions are not renegotiated, the fact that Mexican law, if agreed as the governing law, will be interpreted by arbitrators and not Mexican courts is a factor that could result in a more independent consideration and resolution of the interpretation and application of Mexican law to disputes that may arise under the contracts.

Here's the story:   On October 30, I received a funding request for my  approval of approximately $260,000 representing a cash advance request on   the Bernard No. 1 well, a 16,500 exploratory well in the Cypress Program.    The request appeared pretty routine but as is our procedure, I had Don  Rollins check it out .   Don discovered that we had already paid our cash  call and this cash call represented our working interest partner, Kelley  Oil's share, which is a highly unusual situation.  Checking further we  discovered that  the well is being drilled under a farmout agreement from  Kelley, who wanted to be operator.  Our guys (Thompson/Josey) wanted Enron  (not Kelley)  to operate the well during the drilling phase but did not want  to be official operator of record so they set up Rozel Onshore, our prospect  generator in Lafayette to be our surrogate operator.  Kelley was upset about  this and would not sign the Joint Venture Agreement unless the cash call  provisons were deleted.  Thompson/Josey and team agreed and signed the  agreement which has no initials from the Legal Department.   The effect of  this was that Rozel/Enron would have to incur all the costs then bill and  collect from Kelley.  Rick, as you are aware, the cash call provision in a JOA is the primary  credit risk mitigant that an operator has to ensure that his partners pay  their share of well costs before costs are incurred.  This can be  particularly good protection if a well gets in trouble with lots of cost  overruns that partners don't  want to pay.  In this case, our surrogate  operator, Rozel has no established credit with oil service companys and no  money of his own so all services including the drilling rig are having to be  prepaid by Enron 100%.  The well is heavily front end loaded with costs with  a total drill and complete exposure of over $4.0 million (if thing go ok!)  I discussed this with Dave Gorte and Brad Larson and we all agreed  that we  are forced to fund since the well is drilling and failure to fund would shut  down operations.   Also, keep in mind that this will be an ongoing obligation  (and risk exposure) during this entire drilling phase.  Lessons Learned:    1) The E&P merchant finance team has no business operating a deep S.  Louisiana exploratory test.    2)  Important provisions, like ""cash call"" should never be given away  without appropriate risk assessment and approval.  Please call if you have questions.

Their thinking was that Steve is probably a  better ""deep thinker"" (to use Elizabeth's words) but that he might be bored  with the routine transaction work that Shari seems to really enjoy.  He also  doesn't have the ISDA background which would provide tremendous benefit to  us.  Therefore, I think Shari is a better fit for our current needs.    Having said that, I am extremely impressed with Steve.  He has a better  handle on this California work than anyone I've worked with yet.  He seems  really bright and responsive.  I talked to him last week about working for  Enron and he seemed interested.  I didn't get into any details about our  needs, but gauged his general level of interest in the work that he is doing  for us and his willingness to consider jobs other than his current one.  He  basically said that he would be happy to hear about opportunities here.  I  was talking to Richard Sanders yesterday and he also is impressed with Steve  and said that he had considered trying to hire him.  I don't know if there is  a position for Steve or not.

"Mark, other than the ""political risk"", I would give a low risk rating (1-2),  but would give it a ""3"" as result of the politaical risk associated with the  government changing the market rules or legislation.  As time has passed  since the first auction the Government has showm a much greater inclination  to do some not well thought out initiatives geared toward keeping prices down.

Peter:  I think your collective e-mails constitute the legal risk memo.  What do you  think the legal risk rating ought to be?  Regards,  Mark     Peter Keohane  11/22/2000 10:28 AM        To: Mark E Haedicke/HOU/ECT@ECT    cc: John J Lavorato/Corp/Enron@Enron, Greg Johnston/CAL/ECT@ECT, Derek  Davies/CAL/ECT@ECT, Rob Milnthorp/CAL/ECT@ECT    Subject: Plan B Auction - Need for Approvals ?  Mark, thanks for the voice mail.  In terms of a risk memo, I agree that one  should not be necessary as in many respects this can be characterized as  normal course trading within position limits under a standardized Master  Agreement and without an outlay of capital, but hopefully the following  (together with my memo from last night - copy attached) suffices to the  extent a risk memo is required.  In terms of unusual risks:  1.  We do not have any rights to collateral under the proposed Master.   However, the counterparty is the Balancing Pool which is essentially  Government of Alberta credit risk.  Derek Davies is I believe dealing with  Credit to resolve credit issues.  In fact, I believe the Balancing Pool is  taking significant risk as it is selling the power firm under a Master which  does not match up to the interruptible nature of the PPAs it holds.  2.  The Balancing Pool will be secured under the Master by a parental  guarantee of Enron Corp. and has a somewhat discretionary right to call for  collateral from us under the Master if there is a material change in Enron  Corp.'s creditworthiness.  3.  It is a requirement of the auction that we will have entered into  back-to-back physical hedges for 70% of the volume we acquire, and we are  currently working at putting those deals in place conditional on us bidding  and being successful in the auction.  Penalties can be imposed if 70% of the  volume purchased is not properly hedged.  4.  As we are dealing with the Government of Alberta, we always run the risk  (as we are somewhat seeing now with respect to the Sundance PPA we acquired  in the first auction) that they can change the auction rules, the market  rules or the legislation in ways that are adverse to us.  In terms of the  auction rules, as with the first auction, they could be better drafted, but  our fundamental concern will be to make sure that it is clear that if we post  a bid deposit and do not bid that we get the deposit back, and to ensure that  the rules are clear enough that we are comfortable that we are in complete  control of whether or not we can comply with the rules.  Peter.  (Milly, sorry for not copying you on my first memo - see below.) ---------------------- Forwarded by Peter Keohane/CAL/ECT on 11/22/2000 08:52  AM ---------------------------      Enron Capital & Trade Resources   Canada Corp.     From:  Peter Keohane                           11/21/2000 06:38 PM    To: Mark E Haedicke/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: John J Lavorato/Corp/Enron@Enron, Derek Davies/CAL/ECT@ECT, Greg  Johnston/CAL/ECT@ECT  Subject: Plan B Auction - Need for Approvals ?  Mark, as I have mentioned to you the Plan B Alberta Power Auction is  scheduled for Nov 29/00, under which Enron Canada can purchase for one-year  terms, in each of three successive years, up to approximately 300MW/year #1;   130MW/year #2; and 65MW/year #3, of the unsold PPA capacity that reverted  back to the Balancing Pool of Alberta following the first auction last  August.  The bid qualification documentation needs to be in Friday and US  Thanksgiving is Thursday/Friday.  I wanted you to be aware of this, and  determine from you if any corporate approvals need to be obtained.  Firstly, Derek Davies/John Zufferli will only be bidding to the extent  authorized by Lavo.  Secondly, bid qualification commits us to the rules of the auction, the forms  of documentation to govern both the auction and the purchase if we are  successful, and requires a bid deposit (approximately C$6.5MM), but does not  obligate us to bid and, provided we comply with the auction rules, the Bid  Deposit will be returned after the auction.  Thirdly, unlike the PPA auction the risks are much less significant in terms  of volume and term.  In terms of documentation, if we are the successful  bidder, we will be buying power from the Balancing Pool under a physical  Master, which seems to be a Canadianized version of the EEI Master and which,  although not entirely to our liking, is generally satisfactory.  Fourthly, the position will, I understand, be managed in the power trading  book within approved position limits.  Note:  The nominal amounts owing (i.e.  no up front payment is required) on an unhedged basis for the entire 300MWs  in year #1 would be something like C$260MM, assuming a C$100/MW purchase  price.  Year #2 would be C$114MM and year #3 would be C$57MM.  Given the nature of the transaction, the short time that we have with US  Thanksgiving intervening, and numerous other demands, I do not believe that a  DASH, Risk Memo and/or Board Approval is necessary, but please let me know.  I will leave you a brief voice mail to follow-up.  Peter.      ",mark.haedicke@enron.com,peter.keohane@enron.com,Re: Plan B Auction - Need for Approvals ?,2000-11-22 05:11:00-08:00,received

He also  doesn't have the ISDA background which would provide tremendous benefit to  us.  Therefore, I think Shari is a better fit for our current needs.    Having said that, I am extremely impressed with Steve.  He has a better  handle on this California work than anyone I've worked with yet.  He seems  really bright and responsive.  I talked to him last week about working for  Enron and he seemed interested.  I didn't get into any details about our  needs, but gauged his general level of interest in the work that he is doing  for us and his willingness to consider jobs other than his current one.  He  basically said that he would be happy to hear about opportunities here.  I  was talking to Richard Sanders yesterday and he also is impressed with Steve  and said that he had considered trying to hire him.  I don't know if there is  a position for Steve or not.

"Jeff, will you coordinate with Peter for the legal PRC in getting all the  info on the Cd lawyers so you and I can represent them at the PRC. ----- Forwarded by Mark E Haedicke/HOU/ECT on 11/22/2000 01:14 PM -----   Chris Gaffney  11/17/2000 07:32 AM        To: Peter Keohane/CAL/ECT@ECT    cc: Mark E Haedicke/HOU/ECT@ECT    Subject: Year 2000 - Accomplishments  Peter - Some time ago you suggested that at year end review time I should  provide you with a list of significant accomplishments.  The following is  such list:  January through June with ENA NSTAR All RequirementsTransaction - While similar in structure to the United  Illuminating transaction, the NSTAR deal provided challenge in that it came  together in a very accelerated time frame.  We did not have the luxury of 6  months of negotiations as we did in UI.  We essentially structured and  executed a deal in less than 3 weeks.  It was also a challenge in that I had  no experience working with these particular clients (Kevin Presto, Dana  Davis, Ed Baughman and John Llodra of East Power Trading/Mid Markets.   Another significant hurdle was the education process of the utility and its  attorneys which was essential to get them comfortable with the complexities  of an all requirements trading document. Consolidated Edison Turbine deal - This transaction was blown up at the  eleventh hour, it was another challenging deal which required a creative  structure to flip turbines into a project and take back a call on power.   Again the education of the utility and structuring of the transaction made  this particular deal difficult.  July through November with ECC Sunoco structured power transaction - This was the first project I worked on  in the Toronto office and was the first back to back transaction completed  off of the British Energy PPA.  While the Calgary lawyers had put together a  very good back to back precedent, there was still a great deal of negotiation  involved in completing the deal and complexity involved in maintaining the  requisite back to back transaction. G-6 structured transaction - This deal just (as of 40 minutes ago) blew up.   Notwithstanding that the deal will not be completed, it was a very  complicated deal which involved a highly negotiated services agreement,  arrangements for ECC to take initial equity and an option for additional  equity and trading documentation.  This project required negotiating with 6  municipal electric utilities who were trying to set up a retail affiliate to  market power in Ontario.  The structure would have ECC as a risk management  and settlement services provider in exchange for being the exclusive  wholesale supplier of energy to the G-6.  This involved mitigating and  structuring around a myriad of legal issues. TransCanada structured power transaction - This was another back to back  transaction off of the British Energy position.  These deal was challenging  in that it involved a more sophisticated counterparty who had certain  idiosyncratic issues such as regulatory risk and credit.  We were able to  structure a deal which balanced the parties competing interests and  maintained the commercial value of the transaction for Enron. OEFC Non-Utility Generation Contract Management - We have just recently been  awarded the project and have begun negotiations with OEFC regarding  management of the NUG contracts.  However, the teamwork exhibited among legal  and commercial and between the Toronto and Calgary legal and commercial  groups showed how effective the ECC operation can be.  Your advice and  initial review together with my implementation structured an RFP response  that did the right thing: protected ECC from potential legal risks.  While  there was commercial pressure to bend from these principals we stood our  ground and as a result have a much stronger bargaining position. Transition from Houston to Toronto - While both you and Mark know that there  were some initial issues with respect to working out the arrangements for my  move from Houston to Toronto I believe that I have transitioned quite  smoothly.  I think that I have quickly gained the respect and trust of those  in the Toronto office and of Rob Milnthorp.  Being the lone lawyer in a  satellite office presents unique challenges; especially when the commercial  folks are not content doing bread and butter type transactions but rather  present highly structured deal on a weekly or even daily basis.  I understand  and appreciate that you have gone out of your way to provide support to me  when I have had issues arise on Toronto matters. In return I feel that I have  provided you with comfort that the legal interests of Enron Canada are being  protected and that our commercial team is receiving top notch legal support.   I have done this while still managing all of the little things that go along  with moving your family 2000 miles.

Competition Bureau Raided Enron, Powerex Offices, Paper Says 11/23/0 9:44 (New York)        Toronto, Nov. 23 (Bloomberg) -- Canada's Competition Bureau raided offices at Powerex Corp. and the Canadian arm of Enron Corp., alleging the companies conspired to raise electricity prices, the Globe and Mail reported, citing officials from both companies.      The bureau obtained a search warrant in May, claiming the two companies co-ordinated bids last year to drive up prices on Alberta's central electricity exchange, the paper said. Both Powerex and Enron Canada Corp. said charges haven't been laid, and denied they had broken any laws.      Competition Bureau officials didn't say whether the investigation is continuing. Unnamed sources told the paper the bureau ``is keeping an eye on'' electricity markets in British Columbia, Alberta and Ontario as those provinces deregulate.      On Nov. 16, Houston-based Enron, the world's biggest energy trader, said it plans to sell a 15 percent stake in a key Indian power project valued at $136 million.      Powerex is the power-marketing subsidiary of the British Columbia Hydro and Power Authority.

In a search warrant application last May, the bureau alleged that in the  summer of 1999, Enron and Powerex co-ordinated bids to drive up the price of  electricity on the Power Pool of Alberta, the province's central electricity  exchange, Dow Jones reported.  Both companies confirmed searches were carried out, but said no charges have  been laid and denied breaking any laws.  Eric Thode, a spokesman for Enron Corp. in Houston, which owns Calgary-based  Enron Canada, said the bureau has since returned all of Enron 's files.  Mr. Thode added the bureau has called Enron only once with a question about  the files. ""It remains just allegations,"" he said.  ""We are confident that all of our activities have been in the rules of the  Power Pool of Alberta and within applicable Canadian laws.""  Both he and Wayne Cousins, a spokesman for Powerex, the trading arm of  British Columbia Hydro and Power Authority,said they didn't know if their  companies are still being investigated.  ""Powerex is confident that the bureau's investigation will find that the  company has not violated the rules of the Alberta Power Pool,"" Mr. Cousins  said.  A spokesman from the Competition Bureau was not immediately available to  confirm whether the investigation is continuing, but sources close to the  bureau said it has been keeping an eye on the electricity markets in British  Columbia, Alberta and Ontario as those provinces deregulate.  While most of the bureau's monitoring has been in the form of advice, the  regulator has taken steps for more direct intervention, sources said.  Deregulation of the electricity market is still new and the market is not  established, giving companies in the sector ample opportunity to play with  the system, sources said.  According to the search warrant, the bureau began investigating the two  companies when Power Pool of Alberta system controllers noticed the price for  a megawatt of electricity frequently rose above $100.  In the Alberta system, participants submit bids to buy or sell power for the  following day, and the price per megawatt of power is set by the most  expensive unit needed to meet demand.  Until the Power Pool changed its rules on Oct. 20, 1999, a participant could  change the amount of power it bid or offered up until 20 minutes before the  hour of transmission. The search warrant covers the companies' actions from  June 1, 1999, to Oct. 19, 1999.  Mr. Thode said investigations of this nature are common in deregulating  markets.  ""It's happened in California this year, it's happened in the Midwest, it's  happened around the globe. It's not unusual to see this type of investigation  occur,"" he said.  He added the Power Pool is required to call in the federal agency whenever  there are allegations.   Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.

PRAYER FOR RELIEF 21   Plaintiff hereby alleges on information and belief based upon the investigation made by and through her attorneys, as follows:  I.  NATURE OF THE CASE  1. This is a class action seeking redress under the law of California for defendants' conduct in the market for wholesale electricity.  During the spring and summer of 2000, a group of electricity generators and traders, including defendants, exercising market power, unlawfully manipulated the California wholesale electricity market, resulting in grossly inflated wholesale electricity prices throughout the state and much of the Western United States. Defendants accomplished this result by, inter alia, improperly using confidential real time generator capacity, use, and maintenance data, and transmission system flow data to ""game"" the wholesale electricity market, by withholding electrical generating capacity from the California Power Exchange's forward markets, by improperly parking power with affiliates in other states which was later resold in California at inflated rates, by scheduling previously unplanned plant outages to coincide with other plants' planned maintenance shutdowns, and by scheduling transmission flows to cause or exacerbate congestion. 2. The improper use of confidential real time data was in violation of the California Tariff by which  defendants are authorized to sell wholesale electricity within California. 3. By engaging in said unfair business practices, defendants have directly and severely damaged purchasers of electricity supplied through the California Power Exchange.  As noted in the August 30, 2000 San Diego Union Tribune:  ""The utility bills of all [electric] ratepayers in San Diego are exorbitant. . . . Rates that were 3 cents per kilowatt hour have risen to 19 cents per kilowatt hour in just three months -- nothing short of confiscatory rates.""  4. In its November 1, 2000 Order, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (""FERC"") expressly found that electricity prices in California have been maintained at ""unjust and unreasonable"" levels during the relevant period, though it determined that it did not have the authority to mandate refunds or other retroactive relief with respect thereto.  In its November 22, 2000 response to the November 1st FERC order, the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) concluded that due to market manipulation by wholesale energy producers and traders, customers of electricity supplied through the California Power Exchange had been overcharged more than $4 billion dollars during the summer of 2000.  In its November 22nd response to the November 1st FERC order, even the California Independent System Operator (CAISO) which manages California's transmission system infrastructure, known as the ""power grid"", found that the summer 2000 prices resulted from the exercise of intolerable levels of market power by generators and traders.  II.  VENUE  5. Venue is proper because defendants each transact business in the State of California and because the damages caused by defendants' unlawful manipulation of the price of wholesale electricity occurred in San Diego County. III.  PARTIES  6. Plaintiff Pamela R. Gordon is an adult resident living in San Diego, California.  Plaintiff Pamela R. Gordon is a retail electricity customer of SDG&E, and has been forced to pay rates for electricity during the Class Period (defined infra) that are unjust and unfair and that have been artificially inflated by defendants' misconduct.  Moreover, plaintiff Pamela R. Gordon was born with no lymph nodes in her legs which results in a lack of circulation.  Exposure to high temperatures will cause plaintiff Pamela R. Gordon's legs to swell, which can lead to possible severe health consequences.  As a result of her condition, plaintiff Pamela R. Gordon must maintain her home at temperatures of not more than 67 degrees at night and 71 degrees during the day.  Plaintiff Pamela R. Gordon is unable to terminate her electricity service and has been forced to pay unjust and unfair rates for electricity from SDG&E as a result of defendants' misconduct.  Specifically, plaintiff Pamela R. Gordon was charged and/or paid the following rates for electricity by SDG&E during the Class Period: / / / / / / / / / / / /  Dates Total Electric Charges  5-26 to 6-27-00 $180.92  6-27 to 7-27-00 $226.67  7-28 to 8-28-00 $311.84  8-28 to 9-27-00 $143.48  9-27 to 10-26-00 $84.71  7. Plaintiff was charged less for electricity per kWh prior to the Class Period and the inception of Defendants' wrongful conduct:  Dates Total Electric Charges  3-29 to 4-27-00 $100.50  8. Defendant Reliant Energy (hereinafter ""Reliant"") is a Houston, Texas based public corporation doing business in the state of California as Reliant Energy Services.  It is a generator and trader of wholesale electricity which is ultimately sold to California consumers, including plaintiff and the class, and is a WSCC member.  Reliant operates five electricity generating plants in California which supply wholesale electricity to the California Power Exchange. 9. Defendant Southern Company (hereinafter ""Southern"") is an Atlanta, Georgia based public corporation doing business in the state of California as Southern Energy, Inc.  It is a generator and trader of wholesale electricity which is ultimately sold to California consumers, including plaintiff and the class, and is a WSCC member.  Southern Energy operates six electricity generating plants in California which supply wholesale electricity to the California Power Exchange. 10. Defendant Dynegy, Inc. (hereinafter ""Dynegy"") is a Houston, Texas based public corporation doing business in the state of California as Dynegy Marketing and Trade. It is a generator and trader of wholesale electricity which is ultimately sold to California consumers, including plaintiff and the class, and is a WSCC member.  Dynegy operates two electricity generating power plants in California which supply wholesale electricity to the California Power Exchange.  11.  Defendant NRG Energy, Inc. (hereinafter ""NRG"") is a Minneapolis, Minnesota based public corporation doing business in the state of California as NRG, a generator and trader of wholesale electricity which is ultimately sold to California consumers, including plaintiff and the class.  In partnership with defendant Dynegy, NRG operates eight electricity generating plants in California which supply wholesale electricity to the California Power Exchange. 12. Defendant AES Corporation (hereinafter ""AES"") is an Arlington, Virginia based public corporation doing business in the state of California as AES Pacific Group, a generator and trader of wholesale electricity which is ultimately sold to California consumers, including plaintiffs and the class, and a WSCC member.  AES Pacific Group operates four electricity generating plants in southern California which supply wholesale electricity to the California Power Exchange. 13. Defendant Williams Energy is a Tulsa, Oklahoma based public corporation doing business in the state of California as Williams Energy Marketing and Trading Company, a generator and trader of wholesale electricity which is ultimately sold to California consumers, including plaintiffs and the class, and a WSCC member.  Williams Energy Marketing and Trading Company operates three electricity generating plants in southern California which supply wholesale electricity to the California Power Exchange. 14. Defendant Duke Energy North America (hereinafter ""Duke Energy"") is a Houston, Texas based public corporation doing business in the state of California as Duke Energy Trading and Marketing, LLC, a generator and trader of wholesale electricity which is ultimately sold to California consumers, including plaintiffs and the class, and a WSCC member. Duke Energy operates four electricity generating plants in California which supply wholesale electricity to the California Power Exchange.  15. Defendants DOES 1 through 100, inclusive, are sued herein under fictitious names because their true names are unknown to the Plaintiff. When their true names and capacities are ascertained, Plaintiff will amend this complaint by substituting their true names and capacities herein. Plaintiff is informed and believe, and based thereon alleges, that each of the fictitiously named Defendants is responsible in some manner for the occurrences herein alleged, and thereby proximately caused injuries and damages to Plaintiff, as herein alleged.  Further, Plaintiff is informed and believes, and upon such information and belief alleges, that each of the Defendants designated by a fictitious name participated in and/or benefited from the wrongful acts, conduct, and omissions described in this complaint, and that said acts, conduct, and omissions directly and proximately caused injury and damages to Plaintiff and the class as alleged below.  IV.  CLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS  16. Plaintiff brings this action pursuant to Section 382 of the Code of Civil Procedure as a class action on behalf of all electricity customers, including the retail customers of San Diego Gas & Electric Company (SDG&E), who purchased electricity supplied through the California Power Exchange during the period from May 22, 2000 through and including the date of trial (hereinafter the ""Class Period"").  All such persons and entities have paid and/or have been charged prices for electricity that were ""unjust and unreasonable"" and that were artificially inflated due to defendants' exercise of market power, improper use of confidential information, manipulations, and unlawful actions.  Members of the Class are extremely numerous and their joinder would be impracticable.  Approximately 1.2 million SDG&E customers are within the class. 17. Common issues of fact and law predominate over individual issues, including: -whether defendants committed unfair business practices by sharing confidential real time data in violation of ISO Tariffs and thereafter ""gamed"" the market;  -whether defendants charged ""unjust and unreasonable"" prices for electricity during the Class Period or otherwise benefited from said inflated price for electricity;  -whether defendants exercised ""market power"" in the California electricity market during the Class Period;  -whether defendants received improper and excess profits which should be refunded and paid to members of the Class.  18. Plaintiff's interests are typical of, and not antagonistic to, the interests of the class. 19. Plaintiff has retained competent counsel experienced in class action and consumer fraud litigation and intends to vigorously prosecute this action. 20. A class action is superior to all other methods for the fair and efficient adjudication of this controversy.  The size of the individual damages is small in comparison to the complexity and scope of the defendants' operations and alleged misconduct.  A class action is the only method whereby plaintiff and the class can efficiently seek redress and obtain a uniform adjudication of their claims. Plaintiff does not anticipate any difficulty with the management of this action. / / /   V.  COMMON ALLEGATIONS OF FACT  A. The California Wholesale Electricity Markets  21. In 1996 California deregulated its electricity industry and required the State's privately owned utility companies to divest themselves of their generating plants.  The purpose of deregulation was to introduce competition into the electricity markets, with the intention of reducing rates for electrical power.  In fact, however, certain participants in this recently deregulated industry have, in violation of their operating Tariff, taken advantage of structural flaws in the system and improperly obtained confidential competitor information to artificially inflate prices for electricity, yielding themselves billions of dollars in windfall profits at the expense of California consumers. 22. As part of the deregulation, several new entities were created to facilitate the workings of this new market.  California's investor owned utilities, Pacific Gas & Electric (PG&E), Southern California Edison (SCE), and San Diego Gas & Electric (SDG&E) (the""Utilities""), now purchase electricity for their customers from independent generators and traders, including defendants, through a market known as the California Power Exchange (PX).  The PX maintains a market for the purchase and sale of wholesale electricity through a variety of forward contracts and real time markets.  Under the California deregulatory scheme, the Utilities were, until just recently, required to purchase power through the PX and prohibited from independently contracting for power outside this market. 23. The deregulated market also led to the creation of the California Independent System Operator (CAISO).  The CAISO is an ""independent"" non-profit corporation, though its managing board includes representatives from among the generators and traders, that was created to manage the flow of electricity and ensure reliability along the long distance, high-voltage power lines that make up the bulk of California's transmission system. Approximately 75% of California's electricity is distributed through the CAISO managed  ""power grid"".  The CAISO monitors electrical loads (i.e., demand) on an on-going basis and ensures that there is an adequate supply of power to meet that demand. / / /  24. The CAISO accomplishes this by maintaining a Real Time Imbalance Market (the ""Real Time Market"").  When the CAISO receives bids from suppliers that are insufficient to meet the demand for power, it must accept any bid, which then sets the market-clearing price for that hour. Under the single price auction system used by the CAISO, all sellers of electricity in the Real Time Market automatically receive the market clearing price, which is the (second) highest price paid in the market, even if they were willing to sell and had in fact bid to sell electricity at lower prices. This mechanism allows sophisticated market participants, such as defendants, to game the market by withholding bids in an effort to maximize the clearing price. 25. The Real Time Market was not designed to handle large transactions, but merely to provide a mechanism to correct short term imbalances in supply and demand.  Defendants nonetheless pushed a substantial portion of the daily wholesale electricity sales into this market by under bidding capacity to the forward market leaving wholesale customers no alternative place to obtain the power to satisfy their retail customers' demand. 26. The CAISO also manages the Replacement Reserve Market, which is used to balance supply and demand of electricity.  Sellers in the Replacement Reserve Market receive a fixed premium for having available capacity.  If called upon by the ISO to deliver energy, sellers in the Replacement Reserve Market also receive the Real Time Market price.  Thus, if generators know that capacity is short, they have an incentive to withhold supplies from the spot markets and push as much as possible into the Replacement Reserve Market.  Access to real time generating information facilitates such ""gaming"" of the markets by demonstrating, in real time, available competing supply. 27. In times of high demand, the CAISO has the authority to purchase energy from out-of-state sources, as to which there is no operative price cap.  The CAISO was forced to do so during the Summer of 2000.  California generators and marketers can export electricity to surrounding markets in order to create artificial shortages and drive up prices in the California markets.  They can then resell that electricity to the CAISO at inflated and uncapped prices.  As the PX Compliance Committee noted in its November 1, 2000 Report (""the PX Compliance Report""): / / /  ""During periods of high Out-of-Market purchases, when prices are above the Real-Time energy price cap, in-state generators have an incentive to export energy out of California.  Surrounding control areas can effectively park that energy for resale to the CAISO Out-of-Market calls and return it to the state.""  Id. at p. 44. 28. Notably, the summer of 2000 witnessed an approximately 370% increase in exports from  the California energy market, despite the very high prices and short supplies that existed in the State.   ""Market power"" is defined by the CAISO as the ability to significantly influence market prices and cause them to vary from competitive levels for a material period of time.  Generators and suppliers (including defendants) can exercise market power by physically or economically withholding electricity from the market, moving electricity out of the California markets, and by pricing and bidding their resources in ways that impede the efficiency of the market.  29. Notably, the California energy market consists of a relatively small number of firms, some of which control a substantial fraction of the total generating capacity.  The small number of suppliers facilitates the exercise of  market power during periods of high demand, even when there is not a true scarcity of available generating capacity.  In addition, the relatively inelastic demand for energy further facilitates the exercise of such market power. B. Defendants' Improper Acts 30. Prior to May 22, 2000, the CAISO began supplying the Western Systems Coordinating Council (""WSCC""), an organization consisting of electric industry participants, including defendants, with real time industry data as to electricity generating levels, known as metering data, and transmission system flow data, known as scheduling data, pertaining to individual market participants. Through the WSCC Internet web site, wholesale electricity market participants, including defendants herein, were thereby given access to real time data as to their competitors' actions, although access to such data was forbidden by the ISO Tariff.  When requested by various governmental entities, including the California Public Utilities Commission (""CPUC"") the WSCC refused access. / / / / / / / / /  31. CAISO/FERC Tariff section 10.2.6 states in relevant part; Meter Data supplied by an ISO  metered entity shall be made available by the ISO to the scheduling coordinator representing such ISO metered entity and other authorized users identified in its meter services agreement, but shall not be disclosed to any third party except as otherwise may be required by law, FERC any local regulatory authority or other provision of this ISO Tariff.  32. CAISO/FERC Tariff section 20.3.1 states in relevant part:  The ISO shall maintain the confidentiality of all of the documents, data and information provided to it by any Market Participant that are treated as confidential or commercially sensitive under Section 20.3.2; provided, however, that the ISO need not keep confidential: (1) information that is explicitly subject to data exchange through WEnet pursuant to Section 6 of this ISO Tariff; (2) information that the ISO or the Market Participant providing the information is required to disclose pursuant to this ISO Tariff, or applicable regulatory requirements (provided that the ISO shall comply with any applicable limits on such disclosure); or (3) information that becomes available to the public on a non-confidential basis (other than as a result of the ISO's breach of this ISO Tariff).  33. CAISO/FERC Tariff section 20.3.2 states in relevant part:  The following information provided to the ISO by Scheduling Coordinators shall be treated by the ISO as confidential:  (a) individual bids for Supplemental Energy;  (b) individual Adjustment Bids for Congestion Management which are not designated by the scheduling coordinator as available;  (c) individual bids for Ancillary Services;  (d) transactions between Scheduling Coordinators;  (e) individual Generator Outage programs unless a Generator makes a change to its Generator Outage program which causes Congestion in the short term (i.e. one month or less), in which case, the ISO may publish the name of that Generator.  34. CAISO/FERC Tariff section 20.3.2 states in relevant part:  No Market Participant shall have the right hereunder to receive from the ISO or to review any documents, data or other information of another Market Participant to the extent such documents, data or information is to be treated as in accordance with Section 20.3.2; provided, however, a market Participant may receive and review any composite documents, data, and other information that may be developed based upon such confidential documents, data, or information, if the composite document does not disclose such confidential data or information relating to an individual Market Participant and provided, however, that the ISO may disclose information as provided for in its bylaws.   35. Part of the CAISO Tariff is the ISO Market Monitoring & Information Protocol (MMIP).  The objective of this Protocol (MMIP) is to set forth the workplan and rules under which the ISO will monitor the ISO markets to identify abuses of market power.  The MMIP part of the tariff applies to all ISO Market Participants, including Defendants. 36. MMIP Section 2.1.1. states in relevant part: Anomalous market behavior, which is defined as behavior that departs significantly from the normal behavior in competitive markets that do not require continuing regulation or as behavior leading to unusual or unexplained market outcomes.  Evidence of such behavior may be derived from a number of circumstances, including:  MMIP 2.1.1.1  withholding of generation capacity under circumstances in which it would normally be offered in a competitive market;  MMIP 2.1.1.2  unexplained or unusual redeclarations of availability by Generators;  MMIP 2.1.1.3  unusual trades or transactions;  MMIP 2.1.1.4  pricing and bidding patterns that are inconsistent with prevailing supply and demand conditions, e.g., prices and bids that appear consistently excessive for or otherwise inconsistent with such conditions; and  MMIP 2.1.1.5  unusual activity or circumstances relating to imports from or exports to other markets or exchanges.  The Market Surveillance Unit shall evaluate, on an ongoing basis, whether the continued or persistent presence of such circumstances indicates the presence of behavior that is designed to or has the potential to distort the operation and efficient functioning of a competitive market, e.g., the strategic withholding and redeclaring of capacity, and whether it indicates the presence and exercise of market power or of other unacceptable practices.  37. MMIP Section 2.1.3 states in relevant part:  ""Gaming"", or taking unfair advantage of the rules and procedures set forth in the PX or ISO Tariffs, Protocols or Activity Rules, or of transmission constraints in periods in which exist substantial Congestion, to the detriment of the efficiency of, and of consumers in, the ISO Markets. ""Gaming"" may also include taking undue advantage of other conditions that may affect the availability of transmission and generation capacity, such as loop flow, facility outages, level of hydropower output or seasonal limits on energy imports from out-of-state, or actions or behaviors that may otherwise render the system and the ISO markets vulnerable to price manipulation to the detriment of their efficiency.   38. Market participants used their trade organization, the WSCC, to share access to and use real time information, notwithstanding the fact that its publication and use violated the  ISO's operating procedures, as set forth in tariffs and protocols that were filed with and approved by FERC, and by adoption made part of the contracts by  which defendants were authorized to sell electricity to the PX.  Those tariffs and protocols required that such data be kept confidential to prevent gaming the market and not be used by market participants to engage in anti-competitive behavior. 39. It has been reported in the Dow Jones Work. Com Newswire on October 19, 2000, that: ""Electricity generators may have used real-time plant activity reports from the state's grid operator to their advantage in California's wholesale electricity market, according to an official with the Western Systems Coordinating Council.   * * * * * * *  ""At issue is real-time information the California Independent System Operator provided the Western systems Coordinating Council, a governmental [sic] organization that monitors electricity reliability in the western U.S., about power plant activity in the state.  ""The real-time information allows market participants . . . to access data via an internet site that shows how much capacity a plant with more than 200 megawatts has online at any given moment. . . . .  ""The information was intended to be used to monitor electric reliability on the grid . . . .  ""Last month, however, the ISO's attorneys alerted the WSCC that the 'data is being used against them and to game the market,' according to Bill Commish, director of dispatch with the WSCC.   * * * * * *  ""Commish said generators could use the information to withhold supply and drive up power prices or to identify transmission congestion in a particular region and use that to gouge customers.  ""However, the ISO, which controls about 75% of the state's power grid and real-time market, may have violated a FERC rule because it is required to keep such information confidential for 90 days, an ISO attorney told the WSCC.  ""Beginning Monday, the ISO will no longer provide such information  to the WSCC or other market participants.""   40. Starting on or about May 22, 2000, Defendants used such real time data to exercise market power by, among other things, reducing their output, strategically under-bidding supply to the forward markets, and exporting electricity from the State in order to drive up the Real Time Market price and other market prices.  As a direct result of their improper access to and use of this information, the price of wholesale electricity spiked sharply upwards on May 22, 2000 and has remained at artificially inflated prices ever since.  FERC, CPUC, and CAISO Dept. of Market Analysis, have all now concluded that market participants should be excluded from the CAISO board. 41. As noted in the North County Times on October 19, 2000: ""A case study of San Diego County's two big power plants has concluded that they held back from full production of electricity in June, even as prices skyrocketed and California's power manager was scrambling for supplies to prevent blackouts.  ""To the study's author . . . the low production in San Diego county is clear evidence that the companies that generate and trade electricity in CA were creating an artificial shortage to drive up prices.   * * * * * *  McCullough's hour-by-hour analysis of power output for June found that the Encina plant in Carlsbad generated 44 percent of the megawatt hours that it could have during periods when prices were higher than the plant's cost of production.  The South Bay power plant in Chula Vista generated 61 percent of what would be expected under traditional economic theory.  Economists estimate it costs $45-$55 per megawatt hour to generate electricity at the plants. The wholesale price in June averaged $120 per megawatt hour.  A separate analysis conducted by the North County Times revealed ""mysterious cutbacks in Carlsbad during a heady market of sky-high prices.""   * * ** *  ""Investigators and market analysts have documented extensive evidence that electricity traders have waited until prices rose on California's market this summer before they would commit their power plants to production.""  ""'We did see evidence of withholding in the bidding,' according to Jim Detmers, the ISO's operations chief.""   42. In addition, defendants used such real time information about their competitors to improperly withhold electrical supplies from the forward markets operated by the PX in order to take advantage of the ISO's need to balance supply and demand in the spot market and thereby benefit from the single price auction system by obtaining the highest price paid at any given period.  In addition, certain defendants sold or parked electricity with affiliates in other states in order to artificially drive up prices in the California markets.  They then sold that electricity back into the California markets at the artificially inflated prices they had created. These tactics forced buyers in the California wholesale electricity market to purchase more than 30% of their electricity needs in the inflated Spot Market, rather than the less than 5% that should be sold in that market. The Spot Market was solely intended to satisfy last minute fluctuations in the demand for energy. C. Results of Defendants' Activities 43. From late May 2000 through the present, defendants' activities have raised wholesale electricity prices to record levels, well above the rates that would prevail in a competitive marketplace and disproportionate to the costs of generating that electricity.  Those prices have resulted in an approximate tripling of electricity rates in areas served by SDG&E, where retail rates have been deregulated and represent in large part a pass through of SDG&E's costs for such power, which it purchases from the defendant generators and traders through the California Power Exchange. 44. As the Market Surveillance Committee (""MSC"") of the CAISO concluded in its September 6, 2000 Report (""the MSC Report""), during the months of May and June 2000 revenues from the sale of ISO loads in the California energy market were 37% and 182%, respectively, above the revenues that would have been generated under competitive pricing conditions.    MSC Report at p. 2. The MSC Report unambiguously concluded that market participants exercised a ""significant amount of  market power"" in the California energy markets, beginning as early as October 1999 and increasing dramatically during the Class Period.  Id. at pp. 4, 15, 17. 45. The average market clearing price in California's wholesale markets during August of 2000 was $166.24/MWh under moderate load conditions, compared with $32.31/MWh a year earlier.  While load demand conditions in California during August 2000 were slightly higher than in August 1999, they were similar to those during August 1998 when prices were much lower.  Peak demand in August 2000 was lower than in August of either of the prior two years, negating representations by industry leaders that excessive demand caused these price increases.  Indeed, some California electricity producers were only running at 60% of capacity during the so-called emergency periods.   46. These price hikes have even been effect during the middle of the night, when electricity is abundant and demand is low.  Further, prices in November 2000, when demand for electricity is much lower than during the summer months, continue to be substantially in excess of the prior years' levels and in excess of the levels that should prevail in a competitive marketplace. 47. As a result of defendants' exercise of market power, they artificially increased prices to record levels and have obtained huge windfall profits.  As reported in the October 17, 2000 San Diego Union Tribune,  analyst Anatol Feygin of JP Morgan estimated that electricity industry profits from California for the 3 months ended September 30, 2000 could reach $6 billion, even after taking into account cost increases. Feygin stated, ""'The industry was literally at eight times the profitability of last year . . .. that is a fortune.'"" 48. Defendant Reliant has reported that its third quarter earnings will top last year's figure by about $110 million.  Similarly, defendant Dynegy reported an 83 percent increase in its third quarter 2000 income, as compared to its third quarter 1999 figures.   Profits from Defendant Dynegy's wholesale energy generating and trading division quadrupled to $141.9 million, which represented 80 percent of Dynegy's overall profits. ""This is the most successful quarter in Dynegy's history"", reported chairman and chief executive officer, Charles 'Chuck' Watson.  Other defendants also obtained large windfall profits during this period. 49. Prior to deregulation, the historical cost to produce a megawatt hour of electricity in San Diego County was approximately $23-45 per MWh. During the Summer of 2000, defendants' conduct caused the Real Time Market price of wholesale electricity to frequently reach $750 per MWh, resulting in an approximate tripling of SDG&E customers' bills. 50. In its Order issued on November 1, 2000, FERC concluded that wholesale prices of electricity in California had been at ""unjust and unreasonable"" levels during the Summer of 2000. CAISO and CPUC responses to the November 1st FERC order both concluded that wholesale prices during Summer 2000 were due to a substantial exercise of market power by generators and traders.  51. Plaintiffs and the class were injured by the manipulated and inflated prices paid for wholesale electricity, including retail customers of SDG&E since costs were fully passed through to them.  The CPUC's November 22, 2000 report to FERC concluded that the exercise of market power by wholesale producers resulted in a $4 billion dollar overcharge for the delivery of electricity to California during the summer of 2000.  Due to the unlawful conduct alleged above, plaintiffs and the class paid approximately $4 billion dollars more for electricity than they otherwise would have, causing great hardship to numerous individuals and businesses. As Congressman Brian Bilbray stated: ""Every day that goes by you've got small businesses bleeding to death.  People are literally dying financially from this situation.""  Work.com Newswire (10/21/00). 52. The improper sharing and use of real time wholesale electricity generation and transmission data by defendants to withhold generation by unplanned outages and to maintain bidding strategies which led to contrived and artificial shortages, and other manipulative conduct, had the effect of artificially inflating and maintaining wholesale electricity prices above competitive prices allowing defendants to reap illegal profits amounting to billions of dollars, at the expense of plaintiffs and the class.  FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION  Violation of Sections 16720 and 16726  of the California Business and Professions Code  Trust In Restraint of Trade or Commerce in Violation of the Antitrust Act  (Against All Defendants)  53. Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference each and every allegation set forth above. 54. The Cartwright Act states, at o16726, that: ""Except as provided in this chapter, every trust is unlawful, against public policy and void.""  A trust is defined at o16720 as follows: 55. ""A trust is a combination of capital, skill or acts by two or more persons for any of the following purposes: (a) To create or carry out restrictions in trade or commerce.  (b) To limit or reduce the production, or increase the price of merchandise or of any commodity.  (c) To prevent competition in manufacturing, making, transportation, sale or purchase of merchandise, produce or any commodity.  (d) To fix at any standard or figure, whereby its price to the public or consumer shall be in any manner controlled or established, any article or commodity of merchandise, produce or commerce intended for sale, barter, use or consumption in this State.  (e) To make or enter into or execute or carry out any contracts, obligations, or agreements of any kind or description, by which they do all or any or any combination of the following:   (1) Bind themselves not to sell, dispose of or transport any article or any commodity or any article of trade, use, merchandise, commerce or consumption below a common standard figure, or fixed value.  (2) Agree in any manner to keep the price of such article, commodity or transportation at a fixed or graduated figure.  (3) Establish or settle the price of any article, commodity or transportation between them or themselves and others, so as directly or indirectly to preclude a free and unrestricted competition among themselves, or any purchasers or consumers in the sale or transportation of any such article or commodity.  (4) Agree to pool, combine or directly or indirectly unite any interests that they may have connected with the sale or transportation of any such article or commodity, that its price might in any manner be affected.""  56. Plaintiffs and the Class are empowered by the Cartwright Act o16750 to commence a private action for up to three times their damages and equitable relief due to the injuries they have suffered and continue to suffer as a result of defendants' violations of the Antitrust Act.  The Cartwright Act states: Any person who is injured in his or her business or property by reason of anything forbidden or declared unlawful by this chapter, may sue therefore . . . and to recover three times the damages sustained by him or her, interest . . . and preliminary or permanent injunctive relief . . . .  57. Plaintiffs and the Class, are ""persons"" within the meaning of the Antitrust Act as defined in o16702. 58. Beginning on or about May 22, 2000, the exact date being presently unknown to Plaintiffs, Defendants embarked on a conspiracy to make available and use confidential real time industry data as to electrical generating, power plant capacity, utilization, and outages through the WSCC, an organization consisting of Defendants, and others, to inflate the market prices of wholesale electricity, in restraint of trade and commerce in California. As a result of these efforts, Defendants engaged in acts and entered into Agreements, which  were intended to and have in fact restrained trade and commerce in the California Power Exchange and other electricity markets, in violation of the Antitrust Act, which violations are continuing to the present day.  59. The aforesaid acts, contracts, agreements, combinations and conspiracies in restraint of trade or commerce have consisted of continuing agreements, undertakings and concert of action among Defendants, the substantial terms of which were to artificially limit the supply of electricity to the California markets.  Through these acts and Agreements, Defendants acted to set, raise and maintain the prices of electricity on the Real Time Imbalance Market and other markets to wholesale purchasers of electricity, and, indirectly and ultimately, to California consumers, at supra-competitive prices. 60. Defendants successfully set, raised and maintained supra-competitive wholesale prices for electricity beginning on May 22, 2000, to the customers of the California Power Exchange. 61. Such overcharges were paid by consumers of electricity, such as Plaintiff and the Class she seeks to represent. 62. Defendants' acts, contracts, agreements, combinations and conspiracies were intended to restrain and did, in fact, restrain trade and commerce in California during the Class Period. 63. Defendants' unlawful restraints of trade have had and, unless enjoined, threaten to continue to have the following anti-competitive effects, among others: (a) Prices charged by Defendants for electricity to wholesale purchasers, and, ultimately, to the customers of SDG&E in California have been and will continue to be set, raised and maintained at artificially high and non-competitive levels;  (b) Fair and equitable price competition for the supply of electricity and retail and wholesale price levels for electricity have been restrained and adversely affected; and  (c) Plaintiff and other Class members have been deprived of the benefit of free and open competition in the electricity market in California.  64. As a direct and proximate result of the violations alleged herein, Plaintiff and members of the Class have been unable to and will continue to be unable to purchase electricity at prices determined by free and open competition, and Plaintiff and members of the Class have been damaged and will continue to be damaged by their respective purchases and/or charges for electricity at prices higher than they would have otherwise paid, absent Defendants' unlawful conduct. 65. Plaintiff and the Class have no adequate remedy at law for their irreparable injuries. 66. Defendants' acts, contracts, agreements, conspiracies, and combinations in restraint of trade violate the Antitrust Act.  Accordingly, Plaintiff and the Class seek three times their damages caused by Defendants' violations of the Antitrust Act and a permanent injunction enjoining Defendants' continuing violations of the Cartwright Act. / / /  SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION For Violations of the Unfair Trade Practices Act Based Upon Violations of the Antitrust Act (against all defendants)  67. Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference each and every allegation set forth above. 68. The Unfair Trade Practices Act prohibits all unfair competition, which is defined as ""any unlawful, unfair or fraudulent business act or practice,"" and includes violations of the Cartwright Act,  oo16700 et seq. of the B&P Code. 69. As alleged hereinabove, beginning as early as May, 2000, defendants unlawfully conspired, agreed, arranged and combined to prevent and restrain competition for the sale of electricity, in violation of oo 16700 et seq. and oo 17200 et seq. of the B&P Code. 70. Pursuant to B&P Code oo 17200 et seq., Plaintiff brings this action seeking injunctive relief to enjoin defendants' unfair trade practices and requiring defendants' disgorgement of all monies obtained by virtue of their violations of the Cartwright Act as described hereinabove. 71. As a direct and proximate result of the violations alleged herein, Plaintiff and members of the Class have been unable to and will continue to be unable to purchase electricity at prices determined by free and open competition, and Plaintiff and members of the Class have been damaged and will continue to be damaged by their respective purchases and/or charges for electricity at prices higher than they would have otherwise paid, absent defendants' unlawful conduct. 72. Plaintiff and the Class have no adequate remedy at law for their irreparable injuries. 73. Defendants' acts, contracts, agreements, conspiracies, and combinations in restraint of trade and free and open competition, alleged herein, violate the Antitrust Act.  Accordingly, Plaintiff and the Class seek restitution and disgorgement by defendants to the Class of all monies obtained by defendants' acts of unfair competition with respect to the contract, conspiracy, combination and trust, and a permanent injunction enjoining defendants' continuing violations of the Cartwright Act. / / / / / /  THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION For Violations of the Unfair Trade Practices Act Based Upon Defendants' Unfair Business Acts and Practices In Charging Unjust and Unreasonable Rates (against all defendants)  74. Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference each and every allegation set forth above. 75. Section 17200 et seq. of the California Business & Professions Code prohibits acts of unfair competition, which include any ""unlawful, unfair, or fraudulent business act or practice and unfair, deceptive, untrue or misleading advertising"". 76. The Defendants consistently engaged in numerous acts of  ""unfair competition"", as more fully described above, by inter alia, manipulating the price of wholesale electricity in the California markets. 77. In addition, pursuant to the Federal Power Act: ""All rates and charges made, demanded, or received by any public utility for or in connection with the transmission or sale of electric energy subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission . . . shall be just and reasonable and any such rate or charge that is not just and reasonable is hereby declared to be unlawful.""  16 U.S.C. Section 824d(a).  78. Defendants are public utilities within the term as used in the foregoing statute. 79. The FERC has specifically found that the prices defendants charged for the wholesale electricity they sold in the California markets during the Class Period were in fact unjust and unreasonable.  The California Public Utilities Commission has determined that said unjust and unreasonable prices resulted from the exercise of market power by generators and traders in the California wholesale electricity market. 80. As a result of the conduct described above, the  defendants unlawfully acquired money and property from Plaintiff and the Class and have been and will be unjustly enriched at the expense of Plaintiff and the members of the Class.  Specifically, defendants have deprived Plaintiff and the Class of billions of dollars in monies from the sale of electricity at unjust, excessive, and manipulated prices. / / /  81. Pursuant to Section 17203 of the California Business & Professions Code, Plaintiff and the members of the class seek an order of this Court restoring to them all money wrongfully taken from them and allowing them a claim in the full amount of all of defendants' ill-gotten gains, so as to restore any and all monies to Plaintiff and the members of the Class and the general public, which were acquired and obtained by means of such unfair and deceptive acts and practices. 82. Pursuant to Section 17203 of the California Business & Professions Code, Plaintiff and the members of the class seek an order of this Court providing appropriate equitable and/or injunctive relief restraining defendants from charging unjust and unreasonable rates and from manipulating the electricity markets.  FOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION  Violations of the Consumers Legal Remedies Act  (Against All Defendants)  83. Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference each and every allegation set forth above. 84. Such acts and practices by defendants violate the Consumer Legal Remedies Act, Civil Code Section 1750, et seq.  Defendants' acts warrant appropriate injunctive and declaratory relief, including an injunction restraining them from charging unjust and unfair rates or manipulating the market for electricity. FIFTH CAUSE OF ACTION Unconscionability (Against All Defendants)  85. Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference each and every allegation set forth above. 86. Defendants charged rates for wholesale electricity that were unconscionable given their cost of production, the newly emergent markets for that product, and the consumers' need for electrical power. 87. Defendants' rates were  inherently  excessive, invalid and unconscionable, particularly in light of the deceptive and manipulative practices they used to inflate the market prices and the vital need consumers and businesses have for electrical power. / / /  88. Defendants' unconscionable prices were passed through to Plaintiff and the majority of the Class in the retail electricity rates charged by SDG&E and thereby directly damaged Plaintiff and the Class.  VI.  PRAYER FOR RELIEF  WHEREFORE, Plaintiff and the Class pray for judgment against defendants as follows: (a) That the Court determine that this action may be maintained as a class action and direct that reasonable  notice of this action be given to the members of the Class; (b) That the combination, contract, arrangement, agreement, conspiracy and trust alleged herein be adjudged and decreed to be an unreasonable restraint of trade in violation of Sections 16720 and 16726 of the California Business and Professions Code; (c) That damages be granted according to proof, and that Plaintiff and the Class be awarded treble damages or statutory damages, where applicable, attorneys' fees, costs and disbursements; (d) That Plaintiff and the Class be awarded pre- and post-judgment interest; (e) That the Court enter appropriate injunctive and other equitable relief, including the disgorgement of defendants' unlawful profits; and (f) That Plaintiff and the Class have such other and further relief as the Court may deem just and proper under the circumstances.

LOS ANGELES -(Dow Jones)- A second lawsuit is being filed in San Diego  Superior Court Wednesday against Enron alleging the company, and others,  overcharged California consumers more than $4 billion for electricity  service.  On Monday, a similar suit was filed against Dynegy Inc. (DYN), Reliant Energy  Inc. (REI), Duke Energy North America (DUK), Southern Energy Company (SO),  AES Corp., Williams Energy and NRG Energy. Both lawsuits are seeking class  action status and may be consolidated into one complaint.  The complaints allege unfair trade practices and illegal trust activity. A  news conference announcing the details of the lawsuit will be held Wednesday  morning in San Diego. Enron does not own or operate major generating units in the state, but is  active in trading electricity here and securing long-term fixed rate  contracts for large industrial customers. At times, Enron sells power back  into the California Power Exchange, the market where power is bought and sold  in the state.  An Enron representative said he has not yet seen the lawsuit and was unable  to comment.  The lawsuits claim Enron and the other energy companies withheld power supply  last summer, created shortages by selling power out of state and used  real-time confidential data about power plant activity to drive up prices.  The lawsuits are an attempt to force generators to refund about $4 billion  for electricity, the amount consumers were allegedly overcharged. -By Jason  Leopold; Dow Jones Newswires; 323-658-3874; jason.leopold@dowjones.com   Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

The lawsuits claim Enron and the other energy companies withheld power supply  last summer, created shortages by selling power out of state and used  real-time confidential data about power plant activity to drive up prices.  The lawsuits are an attempt to force generators to refund about $4 billion  for electricity, the amount consumers were allegedly overcharged. -By Jason  Leopold; Dow Jones Newswires; 323-658-3874; jason.leopold@dowjones.com   Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

PRAYER FOR RELIEF 21   Plaintiff hereby alleges on information and belief based upon the investigation made by and through her attorneys, as follows:  I.  NATURE OF THE CASE  1. This is a class action seeking redress under the law of California for defendants' conduct in the market for wholesale electricity.  During the spring and summer of 2000, a group of electricity generators and traders, including defendants, exercising market power, unlawfully manipulated the California wholesale electricity market, resulting in grossly inflated wholesale electricity prices throughout the state and much of the Western United States. Defendants accomplished this result by, inter alia, improperly using confidential real time generator capacity, use, and maintenance data, and transmission system flow data to ""game"" the wholesale electricity market, by withholding electrical generating capacity from the California Power Exchange's forward markets, by improperly parking power with affiliates in other states which was later resold in California at inflated rates, by scheduling previously unplanned plant outages to coincide with other plants' planned maintenance shutdowns, and by scheduling transmission flows to cause or exacerbate congestion. 2. The improper use of confidential real time data was in violation of the California Tariff by which  defendants are authorized to sell wholesale electricity within California. 3. By engaging in said unfair business practices, defendants have directly and severely damaged purchasers of electricity supplied through the California Power Exchange.  As noted in the August 30, 2000 San Diego Union Tribune:  ""The utility bills of all [electric] ratepayers in San Diego are exorbitant. . . . Rates that were 3 cents per kilowatt hour have risen to 19 cents per kilowatt hour in just three months -- nothing short of confiscatory rates.""  4. In its November 1, 2000 Order, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (""FERC"") expressly found that electricity prices in California have been maintained at ""unjust and unreasonable"" levels during the relevant period, though it determined that it did not have the authority to mandate refunds or other retroactive relief with respect thereto.  In its November 22, 2000 response to the November 1st FERC order, the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) concluded that due to market manipulation by wholesale energy producers and traders, customers of electricity supplied through the California Power Exchange had been overcharged more than $4 billion dollars during the summer of 2000.  In its November 22nd response to the November 1st FERC order, even the California Independent System Operator (CAISO) which manages California's transmission system infrastructure, known as the ""power grid"", found that the summer 2000 prices resulted from the exercise of intolerable levels of market power by generators and traders.  II.  VENUE  5. Venue is proper because defendants each transact business in the State of California and because the damages caused by defendants' unlawful manipulation of the price of wholesale electricity occurred in San Diego County. III.  PARTIES  6. Plaintiff Pamela R. Gordon is an adult resident living in San Diego, California.  Plaintiff Pamela R. Gordon is a retail electricity customer of SDG&E, and has been forced to pay rates for electricity during the Class Period (defined infra) that are unjust and unfair and that have been artificially inflated by defendants' misconduct.  Moreover, plaintiff Pamela R. Gordon was born with no lymph nodes in her legs which results in a lack of circulation.  Exposure to high temperatures will cause plaintiff Pamela R. Gordon's legs to swell, which can lead to possible severe health consequences.  As a result of her condition, plaintiff Pamela R. Gordon must maintain her home at temperatures of not more than 67 degrees at night and 71 degrees during the day.  Plaintiff Pamela R. Gordon is unable to terminate her electricity service and has been forced to pay unjust and unfair rates for electricity from SDG&E as a result of defendants' misconduct.  Specifically, plaintiff Pamela R. Gordon was charged and/or paid the following rates for electricity by SDG&E during the Class Period: / / / / / / / / / / / /  Dates Total Electric Charges  5-26 to 6-27-00 $180.92  6-27 to 7-27-00 $226.67  7-28 to 8-28-00 $311.84  8-28 to 9-27-00 $143.48  9-27 to 10-26-00 $84.71  7. Plaintiff was charged less for electricity per kWh prior to the Class Period and the inception of Defendants' wrongful conduct:  Dates Total Electric Charges  3-29 to 4-27-00 $100.50  8. Defendant Reliant Energy (hereinafter ""Reliant"") is a Houston, Texas based public corporation doing business in the state of California as Reliant Energy Services.  It is a generator and trader of wholesale electricity which is ultimately sold to California consumers, including plaintiff and the class, and is a WSCC member.  Reliant operates five electricity generating plants in California which supply wholesale electricity to the California Power Exchange. 9. Defendant Southern Company (hereinafter ""Southern"") is an Atlanta, Georgia based public corporation doing business in the state of California as Southern Energy, Inc.  It is a generator and trader of wholesale electricity which is ultimately sold to California consumers, including plaintiff and the class, and is a WSCC member.  Southern Energy operates six electricity generating plants in California which supply wholesale electricity to the California Power Exchange. 10. Defendant Dynegy, Inc. (hereinafter ""Dynegy"") is a Houston, Texas based public corporation doing business in the state of California as Dynegy Marketing and Trade. It is a generator and trader of wholesale electricity which is ultimately sold to California consumers, including plaintiff and the class, and is a WSCC member.  Dynegy operates two electricity generating power plants in California which supply wholesale electricity to the California Power Exchange.  11.  Defendant NRG Energy, Inc. (hereinafter ""NRG"") is a Minneapolis, Minnesota based public corporation doing business in the state of California as NRG, a generator and trader of wholesale electricity which is ultimately sold to California consumers, including plaintiff and the class.  In partnership with defendant Dynegy, NRG operates eight electricity generating plants in California which supply wholesale electricity to the California Power Exchange. 12. Defendant AES Corporation (hereinafter ""AES"") is an Arlington, Virginia based public corporation doing business in the state of California as AES Pacific Group, a generator and trader of wholesale electricity which is ultimately sold to California consumers, including plaintiffs and the class, and a WSCC member.  AES Pacific Group operates four electricity generating plants in southern California which supply wholesale electricity to the California Power Exchange. 13. Defendant Williams Energy is a Tulsa, Oklahoma based public corporation doing business in the state of California as Williams Energy Marketing and Trading Company, a generator and trader of wholesale electricity which is ultimately sold to California consumers, including plaintiffs and the class, and a WSCC member.  Williams Energy Marketing and Trading Company operates three electricity generating plants in southern California which supply wholesale electricity to the California Power Exchange. 14. Defendant Duke Energy North America (hereinafter ""Duke Energy"") is a Houston, Texas based public corporation doing business in the state of California as Duke Energy Trading and Marketing, LLC, a generator and trader of wholesale electricity which is ultimately sold to California consumers, including plaintiffs and the class, and a WSCC member. Duke Energy operates four electricity generating plants in California which supply wholesale electricity to the California Power Exchange.  15. Defendants DOES 1 through 100, inclusive, are sued herein under fictitious names because their true names are unknown to the Plaintiff. When their true names and capacities are ascertained, Plaintiff will amend this complaint by substituting their true names and capacities herein. Plaintiff is informed and believe, and based thereon alleges, that each of the fictitiously named Defendants is responsible in some manner for the occurrences herein alleged, and thereby proximately caused injuries and damages to Plaintiff, as herein alleged.  Further, Plaintiff is informed and believes, and upon such information and belief alleges, that each of the Defendants designated by a fictitious name participated in and/or benefited from the wrongful acts, conduct, and omissions described in this complaint, and that said acts, conduct, and omissions directly and proximately caused injury and damages to Plaintiff and the class as alleged below.  IV.  CLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS  16. Plaintiff brings this action pursuant to Section 382 of the Code of Civil Procedure as a class action on behalf of all electricity customers, including the retail customers of San Diego Gas & Electric Company (SDG&E), who purchased electricity supplied through the California Power Exchange during the period from May 22, 2000 through and including the date of trial (hereinafter the ""Class Period"").  All such persons and entities have paid and/or have been charged prices for electricity that were ""unjust and unreasonable"" and that were artificially inflated due to defendants' exercise of market power, improper use of confidential information, manipulations, and unlawful actions.  Members of the Class are extremely numerous and their joinder would be impracticable.  Approximately 1.2 million SDG&E customers are within the class. 17. Common issues of fact and law predominate over individual issues, including: -whether defendants committed unfair business practices by sharing confidential real time data in violation of ISO Tariffs and thereafter ""gamed"" the market;  -whether defendants charged ""unjust and unreasonable"" prices for electricity during the Class Period or otherwise benefited from said inflated price for electricity;  -whether defendants exercised ""market power"" in the California electricity market during the Class Period;  -whether defendants received improper and excess profits which should be refunded and paid to members of the Class.  18. Plaintiff's interests are typical of, and not antagonistic to, the interests of the class. 19. Plaintiff has retained competent counsel experienced in class action and consumer fraud litigation and intends to vigorously prosecute this action. 20. A class action is superior to all other methods for the fair and efficient adjudication of this controversy.  The size of the individual damages is small in comparison to the complexity and scope of the defendants' operations and alleged misconduct.  A class action is the only method whereby plaintiff and the class can efficiently seek redress and obtain a uniform adjudication of their claims. Plaintiff does not anticipate any difficulty with the management of this action. / / /   V.  COMMON ALLEGATIONS OF FACT  A. The California Wholesale Electricity Markets  21. In 1996 California deregulated its electricity industry and required the State's privately owned utility companies to divest themselves of their generating plants.  The purpose of deregulation was to introduce competition into the electricity markets, with the intention of reducing rates for electrical power.  In fact, however, certain participants in this recently deregulated industry have, in violation of their operating Tariff, taken advantage of structural flaws in the system and improperly obtained confidential competitor information to artificially inflate prices for electricity, yielding themselves billions of dollars in windfall profits at the expense of California consumers. 22. As part of the deregulation, several new entities were created to facilitate the workings of this new market.  California's investor owned utilities, Pacific Gas & Electric (PG&E), Southern California Edison (SCE), and San Diego Gas & Electric (SDG&E) (the""Utilities""), now purchase electricity for their customers from independent generators and traders, including defendants, through a market known as the California Power Exchange (PX).  The PX maintains a market for the purchase and sale of wholesale electricity through a variety of forward contracts and real time markets.  Under the California deregulatory scheme, the Utilities were, until just recently, required to purchase power through the PX and prohibited from independently contracting for power outside this market. 23. The deregulated market also led to the creation of the California Independent System Operator (CAISO).  The CAISO is an ""independent"" non-profit corporation, though its managing board includes representatives from among the generators and traders, that was created to manage the flow of electricity and ensure reliability along the long distance, high-voltage power lines that make up the bulk of California's transmission system. Approximately 75% of California's electricity is distributed through the CAISO managed  ""power grid"".  The CAISO monitors electrical loads (i.e., demand) on an on-going basis and ensures that there is an adequate supply of power to meet that demand. / / /  24. The CAISO accomplishes this by maintaining a Real Time Imbalance Market (the ""Real Time Market"").  When the CAISO receives bids from suppliers that are insufficient to meet the demand for power, it must accept any bid, which then sets the market-clearing price for that hour. Under the single price auction system used by the CAISO, all sellers of electricity in the Real Time Market automatically receive the market clearing price, which is the (second) highest price paid in the market, even if they were willing to sell and had in fact bid to sell electricity at lower prices. This mechanism allows sophisticated market participants, such as defendants, to game the market by withholding bids in an effort to maximize the clearing price. 25. The Real Time Market was not designed to handle large transactions, but merely to provide a mechanism to correct short term imbalances in supply and demand.  Defendants nonetheless pushed a substantial portion of the daily wholesale electricity sales into this market by under bidding capacity to the forward market leaving wholesale customers no alternative place to obtain the power to satisfy their retail customers' demand. 26. The CAISO also manages the Replacement Reserve Market, which is used to balance supply and demand of electricity.  Sellers in the Replacement Reserve Market receive a fixed premium for having available capacity.  If called upon by the ISO to deliver energy, sellers in the Replacement Reserve Market also receive the Real Time Market price.  Thus, if generators know that capacity is short, they have an incentive to withhold supplies from the spot markets and push as much as possible into the Replacement Reserve Market.  Access to real time generating information facilitates such ""gaming"" of the markets by demonstrating, in real time, available competing supply. 27. In times of high demand, the CAISO has the authority to purchase energy from out-of-state sources, as to which there is no operative price cap.  The CAISO was forced to do so during the Summer of 2000.  California generators and marketers can export electricity to surrounding markets in order to create artificial shortages and drive up prices in the California markets.  They can then resell that electricity to the CAISO at inflated and uncapped prices.  As the PX Compliance Committee noted in its November 1, 2000 Report (""the PX Compliance Report""): / / /  ""During periods of high Out-of-Market purchases, when prices are above the Real-Time energy price cap, in-state generators have an incentive to export energy out of California.  Surrounding control areas can effectively park that energy for resale to the CAISO Out-of-Market calls and return it to the state.""  Id. at p. 44. 28. Notably, the summer of 2000 witnessed an approximately 370% increase in exports from  the California energy market, despite the very high prices and short supplies that existed in the State.   ""Market power"" is defined by the CAISO as the ability to significantly influence market prices and cause them to vary from competitive levels for a material period of time.  Generators and suppliers (including defendants) can exercise market power by physically or economically withholding electricity from the market, moving electricity out of the California markets, and by pricing and bidding their resources in ways that impede the efficiency of the market.  29. Notably, the California energy market consists of a relatively small number of firms, some of which control a substantial fraction of the total generating capacity.  The small number of suppliers facilitates the exercise of  market power during periods of high demand, even when there is not a true scarcity of available generating capacity.  In addition, the relatively inelastic demand for energy further facilitates the exercise of such market power. B. Defendants' Improper Acts 30. Prior to May 22, 2000, the CAISO began supplying the Western Systems Coordinating Council (""WSCC""), an organization consisting of electric industry participants, including defendants, with real time industry data as to electricity generating levels, known as metering data, and transmission system flow data, known as scheduling data, pertaining to individual market participants. Through the WSCC Internet web site, wholesale electricity market participants, including defendants herein, were thereby given access to real time data as to their competitors' actions, although access to such data was forbidden by the ISO Tariff.  When requested by various governmental entities, including the California Public Utilities Commission (""CPUC"") the WSCC refused access. / / / / / / / / /  31. CAISO/FERC Tariff section 10.2.6 states in relevant part; Meter Data supplied by an ISO  metered entity shall be made available by the ISO to the scheduling coordinator representing such ISO metered entity and other authorized users identified in its meter services agreement, but shall not be disclosed to any third party except as otherwise may be required by law, FERC any local regulatory authority or other provision of this ISO Tariff.  32. CAISO/FERC Tariff section 20.3.1 states in relevant part:  The ISO shall maintain the confidentiality of all of the documents, data and information provided to it by any Market Participant that are treated as confidential or commercially sensitive under Section 20.3.2; provided, however, that the ISO need not keep confidential: (1) information that is explicitly subject to data exchange through WEnet pursuant to Section 6 of this ISO Tariff; (2) information that the ISO or the Market Participant providing the information is required to disclose pursuant to this ISO Tariff, or applicable regulatory requirements (provided that the ISO shall comply with any applicable limits on such disclosure); or (3) information that becomes available to the public on a non-confidential basis (other than as a result of the ISO's breach of this ISO Tariff).  33. CAISO/FERC Tariff section 20.3.2 states in relevant part:  The following information provided to the ISO by Scheduling Coordinators shall be treated by the ISO as confidential:  (a) individual bids for Supplemental Energy;  (b) individual Adjustment Bids for Congestion Management which are not designated by the scheduling coordinator as available;  (c) individual bids for Ancillary Services;  (d) transactions between Scheduling Coordinators;  (e) individual Generator Outage programs unless a Generator makes a change to its Generator Outage program which causes Congestion in the short term (i.e. one month or less), in which case, the ISO may publish the name of that Generator.  34. CAISO/FERC Tariff section 20.3.2 states in relevant part:  No Market Participant shall have the right hereunder to receive from the ISO or to review any documents, data or other information of another Market Participant to the extent such documents, data or information is to be treated as in accordance with Section 20.3.2; provided, however, a market Participant may receive and review any composite documents, data, and other information that may be developed based upon such confidential documents, data, or information, if the composite document does not disclose such confidential data or information relating to an individual Market Participant and provided, however, that the ISO may disclose information as provided for in its bylaws.   35. Part of the CAISO Tariff is the ISO Market Monitoring & Information Protocol (MMIP).  The objective of this Protocol (MMIP) is to set forth the workplan and rules under which the ISO will monitor the ISO markets to identify abuses of market power.  The MMIP part of the tariff applies to all ISO Market Participants, including Defendants. 36. MMIP Section 2.1.1. states in relevant part: Anomalous market behavior, which is defined as behavior that departs significantly from the normal behavior in competitive markets that do not require continuing regulation or as behavior leading to unusual or unexplained market outcomes.  Evidence of such behavior may be derived from a number of circumstances, including:  MMIP 2.1.1.1  withholding of generation capacity under circumstances in which it would normally be offered in a competitive market;  MMIP 2.1.1.2  unexplained or unusual redeclarations of availability by Generators;  MMIP 2.1.1.3  unusual trades or transactions;  MMIP 2.1.1.4  pricing and bidding patterns that are inconsistent with prevailing supply and demand conditions, e.g., prices and bids that appear consistently excessive for or otherwise inconsistent with such conditions; and  MMIP 2.1.1.5  unusual activity or circumstances relating to imports from or exports to other markets or exchanges.  The Market Surveillance Unit shall evaluate, on an ongoing basis, whether the continued or persistent presence of such circumstances indicates the presence of behavior that is designed to or has the potential to distort the operation and efficient functioning of a competitive market, e.g., the strategic withholding and redeclaring of capacity, and whether it indicates the presence and exercise of market power or of other unacceptable practices.  37. MMIP Section 2.1.3 states in relevant part:  ""Gaming"", or taking unfair advantage of the rules and procedures set forth in the PX or ISO Tariffs, Protocols or Activity Rules, or of transmission constraints in periods in which exist substantial Congestion, to the detriment of the efficiency of, and of consumers in, the ISO Markets. ""Gaming"" may also include taking undue advantage of other conditions that may affect the availability of transmission and generation capacity, such as loop flow, facility outages, level of hydropower output or seasonal limits on energy imports from out-of-state, or actions or behaviors that may otherwise render the system and the ISO markets vulnerable to price manipulation to the detriment of their efficiency.   38. Market participants used their trade organization, the WSCC, to share access to and use real time information, notwithstanding the fact that its publication and use violated the  ISO's operating procedures, as set forth in tariffs and protocols that were filed with and approved by FERC, and by adoption made part of the contracts by  which defendants were authorized to sell electricity to the PX.  Those tariffs and protocols required that such data be kept confidential to prevent gaming the market and not be used by market participants to engage in anti-competitive behavior. 39. It has been reported in the Dow Jones Work. Com Newswire on October 19, 2000, that: ""Electricity generators may have used real-time plant activity reports from the state's grid operator to their advantage in California's wholesale electricity market, according to an official with the Western Systems Coordinating Council.   * * * * * * *  ""At issue is real-time information the California Independent System Operator provided the Western systems Coordinating Council, a governmental [sic] organization that monitors electricity reliability in the western U.S., about power plant activity in the state.  ""The real-time information allows market participants . . . to access data via an internet site that shows how much capacity a plant with more than 200 megawatts has online at any given moment. . . . .  ""The information was intended to be used to monitor electric reliability on the grid . . . .  ""Last month, however, the ISO's attorneys alerted the WSCC that the 'data is being used against them and to game the market,' according to Bill Commish, director of dispatch with the WSCC.   * * * * * *  ""Commish said generators could use the information to withhold supply and drive up power prices or to identify transmission congestion in a particular region and use that to gouge customers.  ""However, the ISO, which controls about 75% of the state's power grid and real-time market, may have violated a FERC rule because it is required to keep such information confidential for 90 days, an ISO attorney told the WSCC.  ""Beginning Monday, the ISO will no longer provide such information  to the WSCC or other market participants.""   40. Starting on or about May 22, 2000, Defendants used such real time data to exercise market power by, among other things, reducing their output, strategically under-bidding supply to the forward markets, and exporting electricity from the State in order to drive up the Real Time Market price and other market prices.  As a direct result of their improper access to and use of this information, the price of wholesale electricity spiked sharply upwards on May 22, 2000 and has remained at artificially inflated prices ever since.  FERC, CPUC, and CAISO Dept. of Market Analysis, have all now concluded that market participants should be excluded from the CAISO board. 41. As noted in the North County Times on October 19, 2000: ""A case study of San Diego County's two big power plants has concluded that they held back from full production of electricity in June, even as prices skyrocketed and California's power manager was scrambling for supplies to prevent blackouts.  ""To the study's author . . . the low production in San Diego county is clear evidence that the companies that generate and trade electricity in CA were creating an artificial shortage to drive up prices.   * * * * * *  McCullough's hour-by-hour analysis of power output for June found that the Encina plant in Carlsbad generated 44 percent of the megawatt hours that it could have during periods when prices were higher than the plant's cost of production.  The South Bay power plant in Chula Vista generated 61 percent of what would be expected under traditional economic theory.  Economists estimate it costs $45-$55 per megawatt hour to generate electricity at the plants. The wholesale price in June averaged $120 per megawatt hour.  A separate analysis conducted by the North County Times revealed ""mysterious cutbacks in Carlsbad during a heady market of sky-high prices.""   * * ** *  ""Investigators and market analysts have documented extensive evidence that electricity traders have waited until prices rose on California's market this summer before they would commit their power plants to production.""  ""'We did see evidence of withholding in the bidding,' according to Jim Detmers, the ISO's operations chief.""   42. In addition, defendants used such real time information about their competitors to improperly withhold electrical supplies from the forward markets operated by the PX in order to take advantage of the ISO's need to balance supply and demand in the spot market and thereby benefit from the single price auction system by obtaining the highest price paid at any given period.  In addition, certain defendants sold or parked electricity with affiliates in other states in order to artificially drive up prices in the California markets.  They then sold that electricity back into the California markets at the artificially inflated prices they had created. These tactics forced buyers in the California wholesale electricity market to purchase more than 30% of their electricity needs in the inflated Spot Market, rather than the less than 5% that should be sold in that market. The Spot Market was solely intended to satisfy last minute fluctuations in the demand for energy. C. Results of Defendants' Activities 43. From late May 2000 through the present, defendants' activities have raised wholesale electricity prices to record levels, well above the rates that would prevail in a competitive marketplace and disproportionate to the costs of generating that electricity.  Those prices have resulted in an approximate tripling of electricity rates in areas served by SDG&E, where retail rates have been deregulated and represent in large part a pass through of SDG&E's costs for such power, which it purchases from the defendant generators and traders through the California Power Exchange. 44. As the Market Surveillance Committee (""MSC"") of the CAISO concluded in its September 6, 2000 Report (""the MSC Report""), during the months of May and June 2000 revenues from the sale of ISO loads in the California energy market were 37% and 182%, respectively, above the revenues that would have been generated under competitive pricing conditions.    MSC Report at p. 2. The MSC Report unambiguously concluded that market participants exercised a ""significant amount of  market power"" in the California energy markets, beginning as early as October 1999 and increasing dramatically during the Class Period.  Id. at pp. 4, 15, 17. 45. The average market clearing price in California's wholesale markets during August of 2000 was $166.24/MWh under moderate load conditions, compared with $32.31/MWh a year earlier.  While load demand conditions in California during August 2000 were slightly higher than in August 1999, they were similar to those during August 1998 when prices were much lower.  Peak demand in August 2000 was lower than in August of either of the prior two years, negating representations by industry leaders that excessive demand caused these price increases.  Indeed, some California electricity producers were only running at 60% of capacity during the so-called emergency periods.   46. These price hikes have even been effect during the middle of the night, when electricity is abundant and demand is low.  Further, prices in November 2000, when demand for electricity is much lower than during the summer months, continue to be substantially in excess of the prior years' levels and in excess of the levels that should prevail in a competitive marketplace. 47. As a result of defendants' exercise of market power, they artificially increased prices to record levels and have obtained huge windfall profits.  As reported in the October 17, 2000 San Diego Union Tribune,  analyst Anatol Feygin of JP Morgan estimated that electricity industry profits from California for the 3 months ended September 30, 2000 could reach $6 billion, even after taking into account cost increases. Feygin stated, ""'The industry was literally at eight times the profitability of last year . . .. that is a fortune.'"" 48. Defendant Reliant has reported that its third quarter earnings will top last year's figure by about $110 million.  Similarly, defendant Dynegy reported an 83 percent increase in its third quarter 2000 income, as compared to its third quarter 1999 figures.   Profits from Defendant Dynegy's wholesale energy generating and trading division quadrupled to $141.9 million, which represented 80 percent of Dynegy's overall profits. ""This is the most successful quarter in Dynegy's history"", reported chairman and chief executive officer, Charles 'Chuck' Watson.  Other defendants also obtained large windfall profits during this period. 49. Prior to deregulation, the historical cost to produce a megawatt hour of electricity in San Diego County was approximately $23-45 per MWh. During the Summer of 2000, defendants' conduct caused the Real Time Market price of wholesale electricity to frequently reach $750 per MWh, resulting in an approximate tripling of SDG&E customers' bills. 50. In its Order issued on November 1, 2000, FERC concluded that wholesale prices of electricity in California had been at ""unjust and unreasonable"" levels during the Summer of 2000. CAISO and CPUC responses to the November 1st FERC order both concluded that wholesale prices during Summer 2000 were due to a substantial exercise of market power by generators and traders.  51. Plaintiffs and the class were injured by the manipulated and inflated prices paid for wholesale electricity, including retail customers of SDG&E since costs were fully passed through to them.  The CPUC's November 22, 2000 report to FERC concluded that the exercise of market power by wholesale producers resulted in a $4 billion dollar overcharge for the delivery of electricity to California during the summer of 2000.  Due to the unlawful conduct alleged above, plaintiffs and the class paid approximately $4 billion dollars more for electricity than they otherwise would have, causing great hardship to numerous individuals and businesses. As Congressman Brian Bilbray stated: ""Every day that goes by you've got small businesses bleeding to death.  People are literally dying financially from this situation.""  Work.com Newswire (10/21/00). 52. The improper sharing and use of real time wholesale electricity generation and transmission data by defendants to withhold generation by unplanned outages and to maintain bidding strategies which led to contrived and artificial shortages, and other manipulative conduct, had the effect of artificially inflating and maintaining wholesale electricity prices above competitive prices allowing defendants to reap illegal profits amounting to billions of dollars, at the expense of plaintiffs and the class.  FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION  Violation of Sections 16720 and 16726  of the California Business and Professions Code  Trust In Restraint of Trade or Commerce in Violation of the Antitrust Act  (Against All Defendants)  53. Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference each and every allegation set forth above. 54. The Cartwright Act states, at o16726, that: ""Except as provided in this chapter, every trust is unlawful, against public policy and void.""  A trust is defined at o16720 as follows: 55. ""A trust is a combination of capital, skill or acts by two or more persons for any of the following purposes: (a) To create or carry out restrictions in trade or commerce.  (b) To limit or reduce the production, or increase the price of merchandise or of any commodity.  (c) To prevent competition in manufacturing, making, transportation, sale or purchase of merchandise, produce or any commodity.  (d) To fix at any standard or figure, whereby its price to the public or consumer shall be in any manner controlled or established, any article or commodity of merchandise, produce or commerce intended for sale, barter, use or consumption in this State.  (e) To make or enter into or execute or carry out any contracts, obligations, or agreements of any kind or description, by which they do all or any or any combination of the following:   (1) Bind themselves not to sell, dispose of or transport any article or any commodity or any article of trade, use, merchandise, commerce or consumption below a common standard figure, or fixed value.  (2) Agree in any manner to keep the price of such article, commodity or transportation at a fixed or graduated figure.  (3) Establish or settle the price of any article, commodity or transportation between them or themselves and others, so as directly or indirectly to preclude a free and unrestricted competition among themselves, or any purchasers or consumers in the sale or transportation of any such article or commodity.  (4) Agree to pool, combine or directly or indirectly unite any interests that they may have connected with the sale or transportation of any such article or commodity, that its price might in any manner be affected.""  56. Plaintiffs and the Class are empowered by the Cartwright Act o16750 to commence a private action for up to three times their damages and equitable relief due to the injuries they have suffered and continue to suffer as a result of defendants' violations of the Antitrust Act.  The Cartwright Act states: Any person who is injured in his or her business or property by reason of anything forbidden or declared unlawful by this chapter, may sue therefore . . . and to recover three times the damages sustained by him or her, interest . . . and preliminary or permanent injunctive relief . . . .  57. Plaintiffs and the Class, are ""persons"" within the meaning of the Antitrust Act as defined in o16702. 58. Beginning on or about May 22, 2000, the exact date being presently unknown to Plaintiffs, Defendants embarked on a conspiracy to make available and use confidential real time industry data as to electrical generating, power plant capacity, utilization, and outages through the WSCC, an organization consisting of Defendants, and others, to inflate the market prices of wholesale electricity, in restraint of trade and commerce in California. As a result of these efforts, Defendants engaged in acts and entered into Agreements, which  were intended to and have in fact restrained trade and commerce in the California Power Exchange and other electricity markets, in violation of the Antitrust Act, which violations are continuing to the present day.  59. The aforesaid acts, contracts, agreements, combinations and conspiracies in restraint of trade or commerce have consisted of continuing agreements, undertakings and concert of action among Defendants, the substantial terms of which were to artificially limit the supply of electricity to the California markets.  Through these acts and Agreements, Defendants acted to set, raise and maintain the prices of electricity on the Real Time Imbalance Market and other markets to wholesale purchasers of electricity, and, indirectly and ultimately, to California consumers, at supra-competitive prices. 60. Defendants successfully set, raised and maintained supra-competitive wholesale prices for electricity beginning on May 22, 2000, to the customers of the California Power Exchange. 61. Such overcharges were paid by consumers of electricity, such as Plaintiff and the Class she seeks to represent. 62. Defendants' acts, contracts, agreements, combinations and conspiracies were intended to restrain and did, in fact, restrain trade and commerce in California during the Class Period. 63. Defendants' unlawful restraints of trade have had and, unless enjoined, threaten to continue to have the following anti-competitive effects, among others: (a) Prices charged by Defendants for electricity to wholesale purchasers, and, ultimately, to the customers of SDG&E in California have been and will continue to be set, raised and maintained at artificially high and non-competitive levels;  (b) Fair and equitable price competition for the supply of electricity and retail and wholesale price levels for electricity have been restrained and adversely affected; and  (c) Plaintiff and other Class members have been deprived of the benefit of free and open competition in the electricity market in California.  64. As a direct and proximate result of the violations alleged herein, Plaintiff and members of the Class have been unable to and will continue to be unable to purchase electricity at prices determined by free and open competition, and Plaintiff and members of the Class have been damaged and will continue to be damaged by their respective purchases and/or charges for electricity at prices higher than they would have otherwise paid, absent Defendants' unlawful conduct. 65. Plaintiff and the Class have no adequate remedy at law for their irreparable injuries. 66. Defendants' acts, contracts, agreements, conspiracies, and combinations in restraint of trade violate the Antitrust Act.  Accordingly, Plaintiff and the Class seek three times their damages caused by Defendants' violations of the Antitrust Act and a permanent injunction enjoining Defendants' continuing violations of the Cartwright Act. / / /  SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION For Violations of the Unfair Trade Practices Act Based Upon Violations of the Antitrust Act (against all defendants)  67. Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference each and every allegation set forth above. 68. The Unfair Trade Practices Act prohibits all unfair competition, which is defined as ""any unlawful, unfair or fraudulent business act or practice,"" and includes violations of the Cartwright Act,  oo16700 et seq. of the B&P Code. 69. As alleged hereinabove, beginning as early as May, 2000, defendants unlawfully conspired, agreed, arranged and combined to prevent and restrain competition for the sale of electricity, in violation of oo 16700 et seq. and oo 17200 et seq. of the B&P Code. 70. Pursuant to B&P Code oo 17200 et seq., Plaintiff brings this action seeking injunctive relief to enjoin defendants' unfair trade practices and requiring defendants' disgorgement of all monies obtained by virtue of their violations of the Cartwright Act as described hereinabove. 71. As a direct and proximate result of the violations alleged herein, Plaintiff and members of the Class have been unable to and will continue to be unable to purchase electricity at prices determined by free and open competition, and Plaintiff and members of the Class have been damaged and will continue to be damaged by their respective purchases and/or charges for electricity at prices higher than they would have otherwise paid, absent defendants' unlawful conduct. 72. Plaintiff and the Class have no adequate remedy at law for their irreparable injuries. 73. Defendants' acts, contracts, agreements, conspiracies, and combinations in restraint of trade and free and open competition, alleged herein, violate the Antitrust Act.  Accordingly, Plaintiff and the Class seek restitution and disgorgement by defendants to the Class of all monies obtained by defendants' acts of unfair competition with respect to the contract, conspiracy, combination and trust, and a permanent injunction enjoining defendants' continuing violations of the Cartwright Act. / / / / / /  THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION For Violations of the Unfair Trade Practices Act Based Upon Defendants' Unfair Business Acts and Practices In Charging Unjust and Unreasonable Rates (against all defendants)  74. Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference each and every allegation set forth above. 75. Section 17200 et seq. of the California Business & Professions Code prohibits acts of unfair competition, which include any ""unlawful, unfair, or fraudulent business act or practice and unfair, deceptive, untrue or misleading advertising"". 76. The Defendants consistently engaged in numerous acts of  ""unfair competition"", as more fully described above, by inter alia, manipulating the price of wholesale electricity in the California markets. 77. In addition, pursuant to the Federal Power Act: ""All rates and charges made, demanded, or received by any public utility for or in connection with the transmission or sale of electric energy subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission . . . shall be just and reasonable and any such rate or charge that is not just and reasonable is hereby declared to be unlawful.""  16 U.S.C. Section 824d(a).  78. Defendants are public utilities within the term as used in the foregoing statute. 79. The FERC has specifically found that the prices defendants charged for the wholesale electricity they sold in the California markets during the Class Period were in fact unjust and unreasonable.  The California Public Utilities Commission has determined that said unjust and unreasonable prices resulted from the exercise of market power by generators and traders in the California wholesale electricity market. 80. As a result of the conduct described above, the  defendants unlawfully acquired money and property from Plaintiff and the Class and have been and will be unjustly enriched at the expense of Plaintiff and the members of the Class.  Specifically, defendants have deprived Plaintiff and the Class of billions of dollars in monies from the sale of electricity at unjust, excessive, and manipulated prices. / / /  81. Pursuant to Section 17203 of the California Business & Professions Code, Plaintiff and the members of the class seek an order of this Court restoring to them all money wrongfully taken from them and allowing them a claim in the full amount of all of defendants' ill-gotten gains, so as to restore any and all monies to Plaintiff and the members of the Class and the general public, which were acquired and obtained by means of such unfair and deceptive acts and practices. 82. Pursuant to Section 17203 of the California Business & Professions Code, Plaintiff and the members of the class seek an order of this Court providing appropriate equitable and/or injunctive relief restraining defendants from charging unjust and unreasonable rates and from manipulating the electricity markets.  FOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION  Violations of the Consumers Legal Remedies Act  (Against All Defendants)  83. Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference each and every allegation set forth above. 84. Such acts and practices by defendants violate the Consumer Legal Remedies Act, Civil Code Section 1750, et seq.  Defendants' acts warrant appropriate injunctive and declaratory relief, including an injunction restraining them from charging unjust and unfair rates or manipulating the market for electricity. FIFTH CAUSE OF ACTION Unconscionability (Against All Defendants)  85. Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference each and every allegation set forth above. 86. Defendants charged rates for wholesale electricity that were unconscionable given their cost of production, the newly emergent markets for that product, and the consumers' need for electrical power. 87. Defendants' rates were  inherently  excessive, invalid and unconscionable, particularly in light of the deceptive and manipulative practices they used to inflate the market prices and the vital need consumers and businesses have for electrical power. / / /  88. Defendants' unconscionable prices were passed through to Plaintiff and the majority of the Class in the retail electricity rates charged by SDG&E and thereby directly damaged Plaintiff and the Class.  VI.  PRAYER FOR RELIEF  WHEREFORE, Plaintiff and the Class pray for judgment against defendants as follows: (a) That the Court determine that this action may be maintained as a class action and direct that reasonable  notice of this action be given to the members of the Class; (b) That the combination, contract, arrangement, agreement, conspiracy and trust alleged herein be adjudged and decreed to be an unreasonable restraint of trade in violation of Sections 16720 and 16726 of the California Business and Professions Code; (c) That damages be granted according to proof, and that Plaintiff and the Class be awarded treble damages or statutory damages, where applicable, attorneys' fees, costs and disbursements; (d) That Plaintiff and the Class be awarded pre- and post-judgment interest; (e) That the Court enter appropriate injunctive and other equitable relief, including the disgorgement of defendants' unlawful profits; and (f) That Plaintiff and the Class have such other and further relief as the Court may deem just and proper under the circumstances.

"Mark,  Unfortunately, I have been completely buried on the LDC sale process, but I  finally had the opportunity to speak with Bruce Lundstrom a couple of nights  ago regarding the tentative plans for the South American legal organization.  As I told Bruce, I really had not had the opportunity to think very much  about the proposed structure and wanted to give it some more thought before  formulating a final opinion. Given the differences in our time zones these  days, I thought it might be better to send you this e-mail rather than trying  to catch you by phone.  Bruce indicated that you wanted to keep the SA legal group integrated so that  services can be dispensed to the various business functions without being  allocated specifically to the various business units operating within the  region.  As you and I discussed a couple of weeks ago, I agree with this  (so-called ""Enron Europe Model"") approach.  It seems to me to be the best way  to maximize group cohesiveness, improve the budgeting and fee monitoring  process, facilitate recruiting, and maintain regional legal expertise and  core competencies.   Bruce also wanted my thoughts on the idea of having this group report into  the Global Asset group general counsel, rather than to you directly.  As I  told Bruce, I have absolutely no problem, personally, in reporting into him,  if that is what's finally decided.  The only thing I wanted to think about  was whether the structure makes sense given the nature of the region and its  legal activities.  That said, and after thinking through it, I do have some concerns about  moving the group one step ""down the ladder""  within your organization  (actually, since the group currently reports into the Enron Corp Office of  the General Counsel, I guess it would be moving down at least two rungs).   Regardless of whether I, or in the longer-term someone else, is the general  counsel of this regional legal group, I would suggest that you have it report  into you directly, rather than through any one business unit.   First, this is a large group, the largest of the old ""EI"" groups, covering a  big geographic area. Even after the Gas LDC's and Elektro are sold, the South  American legal group will still have a total of 29 lawyers: 13 Enron lawyers  (counting 1 in Houston, 5 in Sao Paulo, 2 in Rio, 2 in BA, and 3 at Vengas in  Caracas [since Vengas is effectively controlled by Enron]) and 16  other  lawyers within the group's supervisory responsibility at Promigas (4), TGS  (5), Transredes (6), and Cuiaba (1, currently a vacancy following Ann  Birosel's departure). In all, we have individual legal groups located in  eight different cities in Brazil, Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia and Venezuela.  Second,  the group covers a lot of different areas of activity, much of which  is unrelated to the Global Asset function. As I told Bruce, most of the  senior Enron lawyers in the group are focused on supporting the origination  functions for the region.  I understand these functions will continue on the  business side under Joe Kishkill, Orlando Gonzalez and Brett Wiggs, who will  report to Delaney/ Lavorato and not to McDonald/Hughes. The major assets are  operated within the joint venture companies (TGS, Transredes, Cuiaba, BBPL,  Vengas) almost all of which have legal groups that work closely with Enron's.  As asset sales efforts are expected to increase and we are expected to start  construction on two power projects in Brazil, I told Bruce that I would  recommend that one or two of the gas unit lawyers (certainly Vicky Martinez  and maybe Paula Porto) be moved to focus on the the Global Asset management  function, to give it more transactional flexibility and native Portuguese  language capability.  Subject to whatever is ultimately decided about the BA  office, I assume the trading function will also continue to exist within the  region, and that the trading lawyers will continue to be represented there as  well.  None of this is to suggest that these groups of lawyers should be permanently  assigned to particular functions and not made available for other functions.   It just doesn't seem to me to be very practical, functionally, to have these  origination and deal activities reporting into you through the one side of  Enron Wholesale that is not directly related to the origination, trading and  other ""deal"" side of the business. Bruce explained to me that he was  concerned that good lawyers would be ""picked off"" by other business groups  and not available to work on the asset side of the business, and that this  somehow partially justified moving all the lawyers underneath the Global  Asset group, at least initially.  I am not sure I fully understand the logic  of that, but to be fair to Bruce, it was late here and I might have been a  little slow.  It seems to me, however, that the Enron Europe Model handled  that pretty well by having all of the lawyers available for work in different  areas, as the need arises, and by having the regional general counsel perform  the role of the ""honest broker"" in allocating attorneys to the different  constituencies. I really don't see the need to do something radically  different in South America, especially given the obvious comparisons between  the two regions.  Third, I think the business guys might question the reporting structure.  One  of the advantages of the Enron Europe Model, as I appreciate it, is that it  allows the general counsel to allocate scarce legal resources without the  appearance of unfairness or favoritism.  It may not be so easy to explain to  one of the origination folks why the lawyer they want to use is unavailable  and committed to a project on the asset side, without appearing impartial,  when he knows the general counsel reports to the asset side of the business  and not the deal side. It just seems to me to invite unnecessary friction  going forward.  Fourth, aside from appearances, I think there is an advantage in ultimately  having the staffing and legal support priorities for the region set at a  level that has some distance from the often competing interests of the  individual components of the separate business lines.  If there is a hard  call to be made in allocating resources between Global Assets and the  origination functions, it is just going to be easier for the decision to be  made by the regional counsel in direct consultation with you, based on your  understanding of Mark Frievert's priorities, than it would be to expect Bruce  or any other business group general counsel similarly situated to tell their  respective business group heads that they can't have the attorneys they want  because another business group needs them more or has a more important or  strategic priority.   Finally, given the breadth of what is expected to go on down here, and the  number of lawyers and countries involved, I would think you would want to  receive your reports directly from the regional general counsel, rather than  through any one of the other business group general counsels.  That is not to  say that Bruce or anyone else would not be able to report things without  unduly filtering them, but to some extent that happens naturally as a  reporting structure becomes more heirarchical. I know that a balance needs to  be struck between having too many direct reports, on the one hand, and  reducing the quality of information flowing up to you, on the other.  For  what it is worth, however, I would suggest that you strike the balance in  this case in favor of direct reporting. Plus, it seems to be working fine in  Europe, if that is to be the paradigm.  As I said, I will go with whatever is finally decided, but I thought I should  at least give you my thoughts on the issue. If you want to discuss it  further, please feel free to give me a call. I should be back in Houston next  week, for a while at least.    Hope all is well, and I look forward to seeing you again soon.

Before coming to Enron, I worked with the Houston  office of a New York based firm (Curtis, Mallet-Prevost, Colt & Mosle)  where  I focused mostly on transactions in Mexico since we represented Pemex on  their transactions involving long and short term oil supply agreements and  CFE (Mexico's electricity commission) on its public bids for EPC and IPP  projects.  Lastly, I started my legal career in 1994 at Patton Boggs in  Washington, DC where I focused on general domestic corporate transactions  such as establishing new business entities (ie, joint venture work,  partnerships etc.), m & a work, and securities offerings.

Notwithstanding the deadline, it would still be extremely helpful  to our case if we received the Affidavit over the next couple of days.  We  would file the Affidavit, and deal with the judge, hopefully convincing him  to allow the Affidavit notwithstanding the deadlines he established (there is  a good likelihood he would do so).

The purpose of this memo is to share with you the decisions tha= t=20 are underway to restructure  Enron=01,s operations in South America.  The b= asic=20 organizational framework has been set.=20  As you know, Diomedes Christodoulou and Jim Bannantine will be assuming new= =20 responsibilities within Enron. Replacing them will be Orlando Gonzalez and= =20 Joe Kishkill, who will become the Co-Presidents of South America, reporting= =20 to Dave Delainey and John Lavorato.  They will share overall responsibility= ;=20 however, Orlando=01,s focus will be on direct sales origination,=20 commercial/government relationships and regulatory issues.  Joe=01,s focus = will=20 be on wholesale origination, financial and operating performance and overal= l=20 country management.  In addition, Orlando will continue as President and CE= O=20 of Elektro until its ultimate sale.  The existing, large integrated asset base in South America (excluding=20 Elektro) will be managed and operated by Rebecca McDonald and Jim Hughes in= =20 Enron Global Assets, which is part of Enron Wholesale Services under Mark= =20 Frevert. Ultimately, there will be very close coordination in both Brazil a= nd=20 Argentina between Enron Americas and Enron Global Assets to ensure that our= =20 reputation in South America is protected, our asset positions are being=20 managed prudently and that commercial opportunities surrounding these asset= s=20 are pursued.  The remaining natural gas and electrical commercial activities in South=20 America will be organized around the highly successful North American netwo= rk=20 business model.  This model employs people, market making, physical=20 commodities, capital and assets to provide reliable, flexible and high-valu= e=20 products to our customers.  It is people and intellectual capital based and= =20 enjoys high rates of return on invested capital.  In the interest of pursuing this strategy, the following teams will report = to=20 Joe and Orlando: =20 The Commercial Origination team will be lead by Brett Wiggs.

Additionally, the team will work toward implementation of activel= y=20 trading South American energy commodities.  This group will be responsible= =20 for managing Enron South America=01,s overall risk and will have a direct= =20 reporting relationship with John Lavorato in his role as head of the Americ= as=20 risk activities.  The Argentine effort will be integrated into the overall South American=20 Commercial Origination and Trading and Risk Management groups; however, we= =20 will continue to maintain an Argentine office headed by Michael Guerriero. = =20  The goal of the reorganization is to create a flat team oriented organizati= on=20 that is very market and commercially focused.  The following support=20 functions will assist the overall business objectives of the commercial tea= m=20 and will report into Joe and Orlando, plus into their line functions in=20 Houston.  The overall goal is to ensure that the South American business=20 units have an adequate support organization to evaluate opportunities, as= =20 well as manage day-to-day business and risk.  Otherwise, the Houston=20 infrastructure will provide resources as needed to manage peak requirements= =20 in South America, not unlike other businesses in Enron Americas.  These groups include:  The Government Affairs team, which will be headed by Sergio Assad, will=20 manage the relationships with the relevant regulatory agencies as well as= =20 governmental ministries.  The primary regulatory goal will be to facilitate= ,=20 in the near term, substantive changes to the regulatory rules to allow a=20 functioning wholesale traded market in Brazil and Argentina. Sergio will=20 assume his responsibilities upon completion of the Elektro sale.  During th= is=20 interim period, Jose Bestard will continue to be in charge of the regulator= y=20 function.  Once Sergio makes the transition, he will also report to Rick=20 Shapiro in Enron Government Affairs.  The Finance team will be headed by Britaldo Soares.

Status update on court proceedings;  2.  Evidentiary matters, including:  (a)  formal industry support for our position - without it, we are fighting  an uphill battle, and I understand the other side will be filing evidence of  industry support for their position; and   (b)  a detailed and focused analysis of the pre-NGX and post-NGX index  consequences, in terms of volume and pricing consequences - our analysis to  date has proven weak;  3.  Goals, including can we live with the risk of no CGPR AECO index.  In  other words, our best argument is likely that CGPR cannot pass off what it  purports to be an AECO index reflecting the broader market, but NGX (and EOL  for that matter) are free to publish their own index.  The result might be  that NGX (or EOL for that matter) is free to publish their own index,  provided it is not passed of as being the CGPR AECO index reflecting the  broader market, and Enerdata then must publish the broader index, if it  wishes, as the CGPR AECO index.  However, if CGPR chose not to continue  publishing, it is likely going to be free to do so, with the effect that  there would be no CGPR AECO index as referred to in our Confirms and  Transactions, which would have to then be altered to account for a separate  and new index, which for the time being could be NGX or EOL.

"I would not want to move forward with either unless you are a ""sponsor"" and  believe such tools would clearly add value immediately.   Mark     Mark Greenberg@ENRON  12/13/2000 11:10 PM        To: Rob Walls/NA/Enron@Enron, Mark E Haedicke/HOU/ECT@ECT    cc:     Subject: eLaw and eVelocity  Rob/Mark -  I wanted to give you both a brief overview of the reviews this past week of  eLaw and eVelocity.  eLaw - I met with principals of eLaw and Steve Horn earlier this week.  The  reason for the meeting was really a pitch of second round funding from Enron  to the tune of $10MM to $15MM.  The secondary focus was on the product and  its usefulness to Enron. Steve made it clear that any funding decision would  be driven 100% by a decision by the Legal Department to use the tool and,  thus, it was up to Legal to review it and see where to go.  The demonstration of the tool was impressive.  Though it does act as a  traditional shopping type site in many respects, it also has functionality to  create a ""myelaw"" page customized to the information you, the user are the  most interested in seeing.  It also allows for a query into further  information, which query is then forwarded to the law firms (or firm)  supporting the practice area (e.g. Labor/Employment) for comment.  There is  also the ability to set up an Enron library so that information on topics  developed by Enron retained firms can be loaded, organized and maintained,  including legal opinions, memoranda on various topics and form  pleadings/documents.  This area is secure from the balance of the site so  that other users cannot access the information.  The loading process is  fairly easy and could easily be implemented within a firm environment.  Some  of the functionality that would be the most useful is due to be released in a  new version coming out early Q1 and by the end of 2001 there is the plan to  have at least 10 or so practice areas available.  Right now the focus is on  Environmental, Intellectual Property, Health Care, and Tax.  I think the tool could be useful, especially in relation to the organization  of information we obtain from our outside sources.  It may also complement  the website/portal concept we are currently looking to make a part of the  website/portal development process.  I would be curious to see, however, what  other tools are out there doing the same or similar function.   eVelocity - I met this afternoon with Mike Griffs (sp?) to discuss the  eVelocity tool.  It was presented as a portal concept to link the law firm  and our legal department solely for the movement, review and payment of law  firm invoices.  While it is billed as a system capable of interfacing with a  matter management system, it can, itself, be used as a matter management tool.  The capabilities of the system revolve around the determination of a set of  rules that are applicable to law firm invoices.  For example, say Enron does  not pay more than $0.10 per page of copying.  This can be set as a rule so  that any invoice loaded into eVelocity by a law firm containing more than  this amount per page would be automatically rejected.  The rejection would  then require the law firm to adjust the bill accordingly and resubmit it to  the system.  This same functionality can be put in place on the Enron side so  that the rule requires the bill to come into Enron for review, but notes that  it is not compliant with the established rules so that the reviewing attorney  is alerted to the issue.  The system does identify the problem so you do not  have to search the entire invoice to see what differs from the rules.  It is  possible to  establish rules that would allow an invoice, presuming it  complied with all rules, to be automatically approved and moved to AP for  payment.   This would require interfacing with AP and the SAP system, but it  could be done.  In addition to the above functionality, the system can also track matters,  budgets for matters, costs incurred for a matter and the name of the law firm  people who are authorized to bill against a specific matter.  Reports can be  generated in an number of formats to assess financial performance against a  budget or overall costs for various matters.  Finally, since it is a  web/browser based system, implementation is not difficult and there is not a  lot of IT involvement needed.  I specifically asked why any other matter management system would be needed  and received the response that there really is no such need.  Mike indicated  a pilot program would take no more than two to three weeks to set up.  In keeping with the ideas surrounding the technology plan developed for EWS,  as well as similar ideas presented for the Corp. portal/website, it makes  sense to look at implementing a matter management system of some sort that  goes beyond litigation tracking.  Whether or not it is eVelocity or another  comparable tool would require further research into the available products,  but I believe it would be worth while to pursue maybe in a pilot program  atmosphere.  What I have provided above is a general overview of the products and meetings  surrounding the demonstrations.  If either of you would like further  information or have any questions, please let me know.

Sandeep's note is below.  PPA Review.  Paul Kraske led a group reviewing the PPA.  His memo on this  issue is also below.  He feels pretty good about our ongoing compliance with  the PPA.  The instances of the non-compliance are not particularly material  and none would appear to play well in the court of public opinion.  I should  also note that it would be very difficult for MSEB to lawfully terminate the  PPA -- that remedy is not readily available to MSEB under the PPA terms.  Both review efforts have relied somewhat on the representations of DPC  personnel.  The India legal team was able to ""tie down"" many significant  issues with written documentation but in many cases have relied on the oral  representations of our own employees to confirm compliance with our  obligations.  There are a number of other legal review efforts underway and I will keep you  apprised as these reviews progress.

Based on discussions with DPC personnel and a review of  correspondence where relevant, no material non-compliance issues have  surfaced which I feel would pose a problem under the PPA. There are two  instances under the Reserve Bank of India approvals DPC has failed to submit  reports to the Ministry of Finance within the time frame indicated; these are  however minor issues. We have to accept that there may be practical instances  where there may not be strict compliance at the site (eg the actual  construction of physical assets is not strictly as per the layout approved by  the authorities) but, from the discussions with DPC personnel none of these  have come to light. On the environment approvals DPC has submitted compliance  statements to the Maharashtra State Pollution Control Board which confirm  that DPC is in compliance with the conditions in the relevant approvals. We  have relied on these statements as being accurate.   With respect to the water pollution issue, as we saw on Saturday, DPC has  notified MPCB pursuant to the show cause notice of the measures taken to  mitigate the pollution off the site. That correspondence seemed to indicate  that there should be no further problems with this issue. However, my sense  is that we have not seen the end of this issue and in particular, the report  currently being prepared by GSDA has not yet surfaced in final form. There is  no guarantee that it will be positive. Shobhan's view that it is difficult to  see how a Court would support an injunction of some sort shutting down the  plant ""permanently"" given the remedial measures taken by DPC is persuasive -  you can however see that it provides excellent ammunition for PR purposes.

In late July, I contacted Chris Hilen with LaBeouf's San Francisco office to  ask if he would represent us in the Order Instituting Investigation which  arose from the summer's price spikes in San Diego.  He said he would check  with Reliant to ensure there were no conflicts.  When he returned my call,  Reliant was unwilling to permit LaBeouf to proceed on our behalf.  Because I  had been told earlier this year that Reliant would probably never be opposed  to  us anywhere but Texas in the future, I called a contact at Reliant who  referred me to Mike Jines in the general counsel's office.  Mr. Jines was  unavailable, so I left him a voicemail message.  I told him that as I  understood it, Reliant is only in the generation business in CA and not in  the retail sales of electricity as we are.  We should both be interested in  options that create better markets, lift rate caps and foment competition.   Consequently, I felt there was no conflict here.  It took Mr. Jines some days  to respond.  The intervention date was quickly approaching and needed legal  assistance, I turned to Arter Hadden.  Some time after we had made that  commitment (and after the intervention date), Mr. Jines called and suggested  that perhaps something could be worked out.  Due to the press of other  business, I did not return the call as the immediate situation had been  resolved.  In October then, as we searched for a lobby firm in Sacramento, one person  who was highly recommended told us Reliant would be ""extremely uncomfortable""  if she were to represent us, too.  She opted not to interview with us.  Since  the message was similar to the original message to LaBeouf, I have moved on  to find another lobbyist and have not followed up with Jines.  If you would like to discuss this more, please call.     ",james.derrick@enron.com,mark.haedicke@enron.com,Re: Reliant,2000-12-15 10:28:00-08:00,sent

The purpose of the Act is to eliminate  unnecessary regulation of commodity futures exchanges and other entities  falling within the  coverage of the Commodities Exchange Act (""CEA"") and the  provide legal certainty with regard to certain futures and derivatives  transactions.  By enacting such changes, Congress intends to promote product  innovation and to enhance the competitive position of US financial markets.  Certain provisions of the Act open the door for Enron's further product  innovation and growth.  Specifically, the Act provides important legal  certainty for energy and other transactions occuring both on an  over-the-counter (OTC) bilateral basis and on multilateral electronic trading  platforms.  Enron was a leading advocate of passage of this legislation.  Bilateral Transactions  Under the Act, bilateral transactions in all commodities (other than  agriculture commodities) that do not occur on trading facility (i.e. not on a  multi-party exchange) are exempt from most provisions of the CEA as long as  the transactions are entered solely between ""eligible contract  participants""(i.e. persons and certain legal entities satisfying capital  thresholds and other requirements under the Act).  This provision essentially  codifies and expands existing CFTC exemptions for swaps and forward  contracts, thereby eliminating a degree of legal ambiguity that has  frustrated product innovation and growth.    Multilateral Transactions  In addition, the Act creates a broad exemption for any agreement, contract or  transaction in commodities (other than agriculture commodities) so long as  they the transactions are between ""eligible commercial participants"", are  entered into on a ""principle-to-principle basis"" and that take place on a  multi-party ""electronic facility"".  This exemption could facilitate expansion  of EnronOnline to allow for multi-party transactions, however certain legal  requirements will have to be met.  Other Transactions  The Act also creates a broad exclusion for a number of commodities that are  of interest to Enron, including ""credit risk measure"" commodities and weather  derivatives .  Again, the derivative transaction exclusion will have to meet  certain legal thresholds.  This legislation has been over six years in the making and the collective  support of many Enron employees has been crucial.  Thank you to all that have  contributed to the passage on this important legislation.  We will have a  more through legal summary of this legislation in the near future.

"My accomplishments for the year 2000 include the following:  1.    EEI Form Master Power Contract -- ENA Legal led the industry  development of the first master power contract.  The form is rapidly becoming  the industry standard for North America and in the process dramatically  lowering costs and increasing liquidity.  In October, we put an EEI into  place with PG&E with the result that Enron credit exposure is $50,000,000  less than under the prior contract.  2.    New Legal Risk Rating Methodology -- implemented a legal rating system  which simplifies the review of legal risks and makes it much easier to  determine whether or not we are being appropriately compensated for the legal  risks.  3.    EWS Legal Website for Training -- website has gone live for training  regarding all major EWS legal issues.  This website will reduce training  costs and increase availability of training to all employees.    4.    Developing New Businesses -- integral part of developing and  structuring Enron Online, bandwidth trading, equity trading, Clickpaper.com,  insurance, pulp, coal, Japan and Australia.  5.     Litigation Settlements -- many disputes were settled favorably  including Fort James, California Px, TVA and BPA.  6.    Deal Machine Never Stops -- projects having lots of complex legal  issues cutting across multiple disciplines including MG Metals, Las Vegas  Cogen II, Pastoria, sale of the Peakers, sale of HPL, Electrobolt, JV with  Texaco (Bridgeline), posting agreements for Enron Online, East Coast Power,  QF restructurings like Motown, Project Summer (sale of international assets)  and on and on.   7.    Deregulation of Energy Trading -- ENA legal formed an energy coalition  and worked through ISDA and our Washington office to pass legislation to  significantly reduce CFTC oversight of ENA's trading business.    8.    Management -- built a deal-oriented team that understands the  underlying businesses and is working to share the legal technology across  Enron.

For this purpose documents include not only hard copy but also documents and information in electronic form and on voice or video recordings. It may well be that you will have questions on how to implement this practice and more specifically what documents are covered. My suggestion is that we start by trying to see that documents are not discarded and determining what questions and issues there are.  Feel free to contact me for guidance as you go forward.  It may well be that we should have a conference call to see that everyone  is using the same procedures and to address common issues.  If you think that would be desirable let me know. We also need to see that other people who should get this notice have it forwarded to them so that Enron's compliance is complete.  ======================================================= This email message is for the sole use of the intended recipient(s) and may  contain confidential and privileged information.

Adds byline)  By Jonathan Stempel  NEW YORK, Dec 20 (Reuters) - Pacific Gas & Electric Co. and Southern = California Edison are at grave risk of default and bankruptcy within = weeks, and are likely to see their high credit ratings fall to low junk = grades if they do not get regulatory help by Friday, credit rating agency = Standard & Poor's said on Wednesday.  ``S&P is prepared to take dramatic rating action,'' said Richard Cortright,=  an S&P analyst, in a conference call. ``The ratings are expected to drop = deeply into speculative grade to reflect the likelihood of imminent = default.''  The agency assessed the situation as the California Public Utilities = Commission prepared to meet Thursday to consider whether to allow Pacific = G&E and Southern California Edison to pass on at least some of their = skyrocketing wholesale electricity costs to consumers.  Shares of PG&E Corp.(NYSE:PCG - news), the parent of Pacific G&E, closed = Wednesday on the New York Stock Exchange at $20-15/16, down $1-7/16, or = 6.42 percent. Shares of Edison International (NYSE:EIX - news), the parent = of Southern California Edison, closed at $17-7/8, down $1-1/8, or 5.92 = percent.  The utilities operate under a rate freeze through March 2002, and are also = unable to negotiate long-term supply contracts. These factors expose them = to the vagaries of the volatile spot power market.  Wholesale power recently cost more than $1,400 per megawatt hour, a more = than 40-fold increase over the $35 per megawatt hour rate last year.  California imposed the rate freeze as part of its deregulation of the = utilities sector, which was intended to promote competition and consumer = choice.  Among the options the commission has to remedy the situation are a hike in = the utilities' price caps.  Even that, however, would constitute a ``band-aid on a bullet wound,'' = said Ron Barone, who leads S&P's utility group and also participated in = the conference call.  Californians have already been warned to cut back their energy use, and = that they may be subject to rolling blackouts.  Cortright said unless the commission offers the utilities significant = regulatory relief, Pacific G&E and Southern California Edison will be = dependent on the capital markets for cash infusions, if any are available.  ``There are bills that are coming due in January and February,'' he said. = ``We would be naive to think that the capital markets are going to open = their doors to satisfy (their needs) in the current environment.''  ``To be frank,'' he added, ``we are amazed that events have been permitted = to reach anywhere near this critical stage. It truly is unfathomable. We = really do need some emergency actions taken now.''  Pacific G&E last completed a big bond sale in October, selling $1.35 = billion of bonds. Southern California Edison and its parent, Edison = International, sold an equivalent amount in early November.  Both companies carry ``A-plus'' corporate credit ratings and ``single-A'' = senior unsecured debt ratings. Pacific G&E's secured debt carries an = ``AA-minus'' rating. Those ratings are considered mid to high investment = grades.  One trader said Southern California Edison's debt began on Tuesday being = quoted by price, like junk bonds, instead of by the extra yield they offer = relative to similar maturity U.S. Treasuries, like investment-grade bonds.  Its 5.875 percent notes maturing in September 2004 were quoted Wednesday = at about 87 cents on the dollar, yielding about 11.3 percent to maturity. = No price quotation was immediately available on Pacific G&E's debt.=20   ",mark.haedicke@enron.com,elizabeth.sager@enron.com,FYI: PGE default warnings issued,2000-12-20 10:13:00-08:00,received

Here's the gist of the conversation:  1. Miller was promised the 4 7FAs based on his discussions with John  concerning Enron's interest. GE is wavering a bit on this now, however,  because other sales reps within GE have complained that we were given first  crack. John characterized our current position as ""the front of the line  without a pass"".  2. Ultimately (and obviously), Dell Williamson will decide to whom these  turbines are allocated.  3. John said we should have a proposed letter agreement on the turbines this  afternoon. He emphasized that they do not yet have the requisite GE internal  approvals. Nonetheless, the major terms included in the Letter Agreement  would be as follows: - Form of turbine purchase contract would be the GenPower 7FA turbine  purchase agreement, modified to include standard Enron provisions negotiated  between Sheila Tweed et. al. concerning assignment, indemnities, etc.; - the turbine purchase contract would need to be executed by the end of  January; - 5% of the purchase amount would need to be paid upon execution of the  Letter Agreement, with an additional 5% due at the end of the month. The  balance of payments in the turbine purchase agreement would be paid in equal  monthly instalments for each turbine through the respective turbine's  delivery date (last day of each of March, April, May, and June); - we would be required to negotiate with GE in good faith on an LTSA, water  system and STG (if needed). This would not be an exclusive, nor would we be  subject to payment adders to the extent our good faith negotiations do not  result in a definitive agreement. - the Letter Agreement will not be drafted as an option (even though it will  essentially operate as one), but instead will be a letter agreement for the  purchase of turbines. Unfortunately, the semantics of this are both important  to us and GE, but I believe it will be extremely difficult to do anything  other than the form and semantics that GE wants (as we are competing with  other buyers who do not have the same balance sheet constraints as us). As  such, we may want to consider an interim OBS vehicle such as LJM if the  looseness of the contract presents challenges for the TurboPark banks.  Lastly, given the somewhat tenuous nature of our queue position on the  turbines, John strongly suggested that Delainey be immediately briefed, and  that he call Dell as soon as possible based on the information John provided  me in our conversation described above. He also suggested that we indicate to  Dell that we have firm sites  (Florida and Longview) for the units. John told  me that this latter point is important to GE as they are becoming fatigued by  their other customers who have slues of turbines and not enough sites to  accommodate them.  Let me know if you have any other questions. FYI, I put in a call to Lisa  Bills on this deal, but have still not heard back from her.

"As for the email on Risk Memos:  I thought it looked good and is very  appropriate.  I did note that there were 4 categories for low risk  jurisdictions, and only 3 categories for each of medium and high risk  jurisdictions.  Maybe we cannot have a ""no legal"" risk in a high risk  jurisdiction; but what about ""many significant"" legal issues in a medium risk  jurisdiction?  Is this then too many categories?   Also, would it make any  sense to have ratings of 1 through 4 only, with a requirement to specify  whether we are dealing with a low, medium or high risk jurisdiction?  In  other words, could anyone be confused into believing that  a rating of 4 is  better than a rating of a 5?  As currently set forth, a higher rating does  not necessarily equate to a greater risk.  Unless a reader were very familiar  with the rating scale, someone might interpret a low number, out of say 10,  as having minimal risk, when ratings 4, 7 and 10 may actually be the ""worst"".

Fidelity wants 2 things:  protection in the event the IRS disallows/disqualifies the tax credits  accrued (i.e., the $300K), and protection against any environmental claims that may have occurred while they  were a partner in LGI (June, 200 thru Jan, 2001).  There are 2 basic alternatives to consider:  replace the existing guaranty to LGI with a new guaranty to Fidelity with a  specific cap on the tax credit amount ($300K+/-) and with the same  environmental coverage (up to $5MM) as currently exists but restricting it to  issues which occurred while they were a partner.  The probability of either  ever being triggered is extremely remote.  Replacing the benefactor from LGI  to Fidelity is significant for us because it eliminates future environmental  exposure related to LGI as well as prevents potential future buyers of our LP  interest from seeing that ENE once was willing to issue such a guaranty. replace the existing guaranty with an indemnity from ENA which provides  Fidelity with the same protection as alternative #1.  Per ENA accounting  since the amount of exposure is limited to $5.3MM in aggregate, this would  not be significant/material enough to be separately identified as a balance  sheet item.

"I agree with your reasoning.  Mark     Christian Yoder  01/04/2001 03:37 PM        To: William S Bradford/HOU/ECT@ECT, Tracy Ngo/PDX/ECT@ECT    cc: Mark E Haedicke/HOU/ECT@ECT, Earline Kendall/HOU/ECT@ECT, Mark  Holsworth/Corp/Enron@ENRON    Subject: The Ongoing CalPX Indemnity Agreement Issue  The CalPx has written us a letter saying that if we do not sign their  proposed indemnity agreement by January 12, we will have to post collateral  (letter of credit) for the full extent of our exposure to them (approx  $25million).  Implicit in this demand is the threat that if we do not post  the collateral, they will not allow us to do any business with them.  All things considered, I recommend that we consider posting the collateral  and that we do not sign the indemnity agreement.  This recommendation assumes  that we want to continue to do some residual business with the CalPX.   Obviously, if our traders don't care about doing any business with them, we  should just call their bluff and quit trading with them, but I don't think we  would really want to do this.  The reason why I do not think we should sign the indemnity agreement is  because it exposes us (Enron Corp.) to the very real PX credit meltdown  risk.  Under the PX's Surety Bond with AIG,  if creditors of the CalPX,  say,  the big three California Utilities for example,  teetering as they are on the  brink of insolvency,  were to default to the PX, then AIG must keep the CalPX  whole.  If AIG pays any money to the PX, it will immediately turn to its  indemnity agreements with all the non-defaulting participants (including  ours)  and try to recover from them.  Although the indemnity agreements  purport to limit  AIG's ability to recover from us to our own specific  default with the PX,  I do not think we should rely on the wording of the  agreement to guarantee that we would not be washed into some kind of broader  claim by AIG in a meltdown situation.  The wording is too ambiguous.   If I  were outside counsel, I would not write us a legal opinion saying that if we  signed the indemnity agreement we would not have any exposure in a meltdown.    Therefore, given the solvency crisis with the big three utilities, I think we  should assume there will be a major payment default and  I think,  if we must  continue to do business with the PX, we should do it on the basis of posting  collateral for our exposure.  Such collateral would be clearly tied to our  own default and we should be able to control our own default risk with them.   I have asked Tracy to set up a conference call to go over this reasoning.   ----cgy    ",christian.yoder@enron.com,mark.haedicke@enron.com,Re: The Ongoing CalPX Indemnity Agreement Issue,2001-01-04 11:01:00-08:00,sent

The commercial situation at Dahbol Power Company is deteriorating pretty  rapidly.  MSEB is now approx. 45 days late on payment in full of the October  invoice.  They have paid only a relatively modest portion of that bill.   Payment on the November bill is about 15 days late.  The MSEB Chairman says  that MSEB can't pay these invoices.  At present, the Governments of Maharashtra and India are refusing to engage  in a constructive dialogue on solving the non-payment issue and the 1400 MW  that will come on line as part of Phase II.  They say that they recognize  their obligations as guarantors of MSEB's obligations but are not interested  in helping in any different capacity (e.g., GOI buys some or all of Phase II).  Until just a few days ago, the lead India bank was refusing to fund even  their own ongoing interest obligation.  At present, they are refusing to  continue funding any other Phase II draw request.  The India banks have a  great deal to lose and, in our opinion, should strongly consider continuing  to fund Phase II.  It would seem that the lead India bank is scared, knaive  or, worse yet, very pessimistic about Dabhol's future -- perhaps there are  other reasons for their current position.  We are meeting with the international banks in NY on Tuesday.  Our main goal  is to convince them to continue to fund and to use their influence to have  the India banks do the same.  The current India legal crisis team is nearly identical to the 1995 India  legal crisis team.  The same law firms and lawyers (both Indian and  international) are continuing to play much the same roles.  We have not identified any particular ""holes"" in Dabhol's legal position.   While the India newspapers have offered up various theories that might allow  MSEB to cancel the PPA (frustration of purpose, etc.), none seem compelling.   No counterparty has offered up any of these theories directly to DPC.  In the short term, we are preparing (1) a demand under the GOM guarantee and  (2) a ""meet and discuss"" letter under the PPA.  The current plan is to serve  these next week.  We are also preparing (3) an arbitration notice under the  GOM guarantee, (4) a demand under the GOI guarantee and (5) an action against  MERC.  MERC is the Maharashtra Energy Regulatory Commission.  They have  issued ""orders"" over the last year limiting the amount of power that MESB  buys from Dabhol.  We do not believe that they have jurisdiction to do so.   We may or may not ultimately file this action.  Let me know if I can provide any further information.

Inevitably, we have to fight hard for these ""concessions"" in our  negotiations and end up leaving a lot of Enron consideration (not to mention  blood and sweat) on the table to get these provisions inserted in our  contracts.  If we are really being ""taken"" by these crafty Brazilian lawyers  (like the former General Counsel of the Odebrecht Group), I think we should  re-think the policy in this specific instance.  Elektro, because it is the fifth largest electricity LDC in Brazil, has a  long history of litigation in the Sao Paulo courts (we had a number of cases,  you will recall, when we bought it, and have had others since). It is clearly  not the only substantial, high-profile Brazilian company Enron has down here,  making it a little hard for us to negotiate these provisions as ""foreigners""   the way we do elsewhere.    By all means we should check with Jose Emilio, but if he shares Sami's (and,  I have to say, my) concerns, I think we should consider making a special rule  for Brazil-to-Brazil contracting transactions.  Perhaps we could have the  first position be ICC arbitration in Sao Paulo (in English?), with a forum  savings clause that states that if the arbitration provision is held  unenforceable that the litigation will be in the courts (federal, if  possible) of Sao Paulo.  The worst thing that could happen is that we enter  into an arbitration provision, thinking we are safe, and end up in some court  in a smaller city in a backwater part of Brazil where they are a little loose  on the law and perhaps even looser on the concepts of justice, due process,  etc.  If you would like me to be involved in the further discussions, let me know.

I will call Jos, Emilio to check.  I agree that a foreign arbitral award is  enforceable in Brazil (whether international or local aspects are under  discussion) provided that you follow the ""exequatur"" procedure at the  Brazilian Supreme Court.  I have personally participated in the enforcement  of a foreign arbital award against Odebrecht a few years ago.  However, the point I am raising is that in case one of the two Brazilian  contracting entities challenge such foreign arbitration clause and refer the  matter under dispute to a local court, it is most likely that the Brazilian  judge will accept jurisdiction and review the case, in accordance with  Article 88 (I)(II)(III) of the Brazilian Civil Procedure Code.  In such  event, if Enron (please note that I am always & only referring to an Enron  Brazilian entity) agrees to a foreign arbitration clause with a Brazilian  counterparty, it may end up resolving its contractual disputes at the  Brazilian courts (and this is exactly what I am trying to avoid by suggesting  ICC arbitration in S?o Paulo for all contracts entered into between two  Brazilian entities).  Even if the two Brazilian contracting entities refer the matter under dispute  to foreign arbitration and, at the same time or at a later stage, one of the  parties decide to challenge the foreign arbitration clause and refer the  matter to the local courts, it is most likely that the Brazilian Supreme  Court will recognize the local courts jurisdiction and decide that the  foreign arbitration clause was null and void.  I will be in Houston on Friday, January 26, and would very much appreciate  the opportunity to discuss this matter in detail with you and possibly with  Rob Walls and/or Jim Derrick.  Regards,  Sami     Robert C Williams@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT 01/09/2001 10:18 PM To: Sami Arap/SA/Enron@ENRON cc: Michelle Blaine/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT,  margalith@elektro.com.br@ENRON, Randy Young, Rob Walls   Subject: Re: Elektro's telecom project    Sami,  I agree on the issue of Brazilian law.  But on the question of foreign  arbitration, our advice has been that such a clause will be enforced by the  local courts, even if the dispute has no international aspects other than the  parent is foreign (although there was a dissenting opinion from one lawyer on  this issue).   Could you check this point with Jose Emilio Pinto at Tozzini  or Fernando Serec?  As to local arbitration, we have accepted this where the  dollar amount of the disputes is likely to be less than $500,000.  We should  probably also have a cumulative cap of, say, $5 million.   On bigger deals,  Rob orJim have resisted local court jurisdiction.  The most flexible they  have been to my knowledge where more $ is at stake is to agree to  ICC-administered arbitration in Sao Paulo.  In this case, I think we should  propose the local arbitration procedure which would is best calculated to  result in an impartial award, whether that be ad hoc, ICC, FIESP, or  Canadian-Brazilian C of C.  Jose Emilio would have a view on this, too.  Hope  this is helpful.  Bob      Sami Arap@ENRON 01/09/2001 04:48 PM To: Michelle Blaine/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT, Robert C  Williams/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT cc: margalith@elektro.com.br   Subject: Re: Elektro's telecom project        Michelle and Bob;  Thanks for the reply.  The issue here is when Brazilian entities (only) are  entering into a contract which obligations will only be performed in Brazil  and such agreement is governed by Brazilian laws.  My understanding of the  Enron arbitration policy (and please correct me if I am wrong) is that when  Enron (as a foreign company) is dealing with foreign governments,  governmental agencies or government-owned companies, or private companies  from the host company, we must follow our internal policy by choosing  preferred arbitration rules, preferred place of arbitration and preferred  governing law.  In case of Elektro, as well as any other Brazilian Enron entity (EAS, ECE  etc), entering into a contract with another Brazilian party with obligations  to be performed in Brazil, such contract will most likely be governed by  Brazilian laws.  Although the parties are in principle able to select a  foreign law in Brazil, the contracting parties must comply with local public  policy.  I strongly advise that two or more Brazilian parties contracting  obligations in Brazil agree that the respective contract be governed by the  laws of Brazil.  With respect to the dispute resolution mechanism, we are all aware of Enron's  policy to avoid referring disputes to the Brazilian courts.  In case of the  above mentioned Elektro deal, the idea is to submit all contract  controversies to arbitration under ICC rules in S?o Paulo.  To me, the  question is whether we use ""ad hoc"" arbitration OR institutional arbitration  (i.e. submit the matter to FIESP or the Canadian-Brazilian Chamber of  Commerce to act as the ""arbitration administrator"").  FYI since I joined Enron, I've been told that all of Enron's Brazilian  entities should use foreign arbitration as their contracts' dispute  resolution mechanism.  In my opinion, this concept may not work the way Enron  wants.  If the local Enron entity is dealing with another Brazilian party and  (suppose) both parties have agreed to use ICC arbitration in NY, it is most  likely that, in case the Brazilian counterparty decides to refer the matter  under dispute to the Brazilian courts, the local judge will accept  jurisdiction and review the case.  You may ask ""why"".  The reason is because  there are two Brazilian parties contracting obligations to be performed in  Brazil under the laws of Brazil; as a consequence a local judge will accept  jurisdiction.  I'd very much like to emphasize that, while working as General Counsel of the  Odebrecht Group, I use to accept foreign arbitration clauses in contracts  entered with Affiliates of foreign companies because I knew that, at the end  of the day, I could always challenge the dispute resolution mechanism agreed  in the contract and refer the matter to the local courts.  Since Odebrecht's  counterparties did not do their homework properly ...  Arbitration was first introduced in Brazil through the Federal Constitution  of 1824.  The Civil Code of 1916 ractified the use of arbitration, however,  it obliged the arbitral award to be reviewed by the local courts.  Only in  1996, with the issuance of the Brazilian Arbitration Act (Law 9307), it was  recognized the use of arbitration as a definitive dispute resolution  mechanism without having to submit the final arbitral award to the review of  the local courts.  With respect to enforceability, please note that the arbitral award is final,  binding and enforceable towards the contracting parties.  Only in case a  Party decides not to comply with the final arbital award, the other Party may  refer the arbitral award to a local judge to obtain an ""exequatur"".

Freshfields also would provide up to 100 hours of  consulting services regarding the dataroom product for no additional monetary  consideration but DealBench would give Freshfields exclusive recognition for  helping DealBench develop the dataroom product in Europe and Asia.

Attached is Ned's memo outlining our conclusions at this time. In essence, we  thought that:  Only upon the parties' mutually agreement would the use of a qualified  independent expert (arbitrator) subject to AAA rules (note: the current  language in the draft would need to be changed to clarify that AAA rules  would apply to the IE's proceedings) be the appropriate mechanism for the  expeditious handling of a narrow group of technical disputes (""Technical  Disputes""). Primarily, these would be disputes over the adjustment of the  contract price for a change order or the date of a milestone or completion  date due a change order.  In the interests of an expeditious resolution, the current draft should be  changed to reflect that the IE's decisions would be final, and  non-appealable, as contrasted with the current draft where in certain  instances they can be appealed to the three-arbitrator panel. The ""baseball arbitration"" approach required in the current draft should be  used by the IE for these Technical Disputes only, and would not apply to  disputes handled by the three-arbitrator Panel. The commercial people on the  Enron LNG side of the table like baseball arbitration b/c they believe it  mitigates the possibility of claims inflation by the Contractor in these  change order price disputes.  All other disputes under the Contract would be handled by a three-arbitrator  panel (""Panel"") subject to AAA rules, which would also handle all Technical  Disputes if the parties cannot mutually agree to an IE. The Dispute Resolution Section of the draft Contract should be refined in  some areas to provide greater clarity. Andy and Ned are in the process of  doing this.  If you have any questions before you visit with Vicki or John, please advise  any of us.

Consent Issue:  Jose Bestard (he's the main developer who did this deal)  reported that he met with Furnas this week.  Furnas had not received  EPE's  letter addressing the consent issue.  Furnas continues to link its failure to  sign the consent to commercial exposure to the high price from the MAE. There  are initials on the original consent and no one (including Furnas) knows  whose they are. John Novak told me he's not sure of the significance, but it  is not uncommon in Brazil to initial documents. Nevertheless, we need to ask  our Brazilian lawyers whether there is any significance under Brazilian law.   Keep in mind also that consent document was between EPE and the assignor,  Electronorte.   2.  Arbitration considerations:  Bestard has a meeting planned with the  ambassador.  He  consulted Enron's financial/business consultant in Brazil,  Winston Fernino (sp?) who advised that we should exhaust all political  avenues before resorting to litigation or arbitration.   What concerns me,  however, is  his advice that, politically, it is not the time to seek  assistance fromthe president for the consent, that there is a political  battle in the senate, and that we should wait until the end of February to  seek political assistance.  My view on that is, to wait 4 more weeks to  progress with this notice of default, when the 90 day cure period has  expired, plus the 30 day extension which has also expired, sends the wrong  message and weakens our position. Thus, it is my recommendation that we  proceed immediately with a notice to terminate under Clause 27, paragraph 2  of the PPA, which then requires a 30day consultation period (paragraph3) at  the end of which we have the option to terminate.  This buys us a little  time, but keeps the pressure on, at the end of which we can initiate  proceedings to compel the consent or to terminate.  I'm not sure what  reaction the notice to terminate could bring about from Furnas. I'm not sure  how that plays out in our settlement with Siemans. Consider also that the  commercial people are not comfortable with termination yet.  I am not sure  what rights, if any, we waive by waiting around doing nothing or how that may  affect our position in arbitration or litigation (something we need to look  at under the contract, although I cannot immediately recall any deadlines or  express waivers related to timing in this regard).  I committed that we would  advise the team on the next call (next Thursday) our recommendation with  respect to  arbitration/litigation.   I want to make sure they understand  every possibility so they can make an informed decision. You have the matrix  developed already if you want to expand on that, or handle that your own  way.  Bestard opines that Furnas will fight hard, that they have  traditionally been very adversarial and uncooperative. I'll find out who  represents them.   3. Force Majeure:   Furnas is also taking a very strong position that EPE  does not have a valid force majeure claim.  Based on my reading of the  contract, our facts appear to fit squarely under Clause 95(c).   However, I'm  told we did not comply strictly to the notice terms. We'll need to show that  we were not negligent as a cause for the attorney general's action.  Laine  Powell, President of the Cuiaba companies will gather the information on our  force majeure claim and we need to consider the legal issues related to our  position.    Note that if FM lasts more than 12 consecutive months, both  parties have the right to terminate.  No one buys the plant and we're stuck.   I'll find out the date of our last FM notice.  There have been several.  4.  Budget:  Lets consider what it will cost to nail down this arbitration  concern and give initial advice on how to proceed over the next week,  what  it will cost to prepare for arbitration and, the cost of the arbitration.  Darren I'll call you tomorrow and we can break that out.  We may want to  consider the litigation route. We'll need to put together some kind of  proposed or potential time line, and what will happen in each stage and tie a  number to it.  I've done this with Pete before and he seems to like it.  It  needs to be subject to review as we go along.  5.NEXT: Prep for the call and get a recommended strategy in place. I'm going  to get together all our opinions on the Brazilian state of arbitration and  get a conference call with one of these experts so we can get the best  advice.  We certainly have some conflicting views.  Our experience in the  Brazilian courts is that nothing happens and we could be stuck for years, so  I am inclined to take our chances with arbitration and we may get stuck in  the court anyway.  If we go to court, perhaps Furnas would take the position  that we must arbitrate, that is what Fernando Serec said.  Who knows. Please give me your comments or just call me.  I'm open to any suggestions.  John Novak will be able to tell us about all the competing concerns that I  may be unaware of with any strategic plan.

"Hopefully when we recruit for other areas, like LNG and the like, we will  pick up a lawyer with some shipping experience.  It seems like overkill to  recruit just for shipping.

We had this approach from Stu Staley and  Pierre Aury.   My line to them has basically been: we will provide best shipping advice  promptly: please refer all your queries in this regard to Justin Boyd's team  ie first contact: Robert Quick, Rahul Saxena, then any other team members,  including Justin and failing them, me.   So far, we are far from being swamped with technical shipping issues that we  cannot deal with in-house. As and when we get to that position, we have good  relationships with the best shipping firms in London, including Richards  Butler and Sinclair Roche and Temperley. This may be adequate cover at that  stage. Alternatively we may decide to recruit. In making that decision we  would of course consult with George and Stu and the rest of the team. My view  is that we are not at that stage yet.   I would love this business to expand to the position where we needed to do  that, and I hope we get there soon. When we do, we will ensure these business  areas are properly covered until we get new staff on board. The business will  not be prejudiced by a wait and see approach.  This approach has satisfied Stu and Pierre. Of course we have to be flexible;  if George is adamant and prepared to fund the recruitment, then off we go. I  think I could persuade him however that he didn't need to do that now.   What are your views on this?  Subject to how you want to play things / have already played things with  George, I would propose to speak to Stu and Pierre about this again and then  call George to ensure he is happy with the game plan.

These relate to the following:   Nominating Committee Results  Citigroup  Board Meeting Schedule  Strategic Planning Meeting Schedule   Pre-Strategic Planning Lunches  Nominating Committee Results   The Nominating Committee has completed its deliberations and has recommended 11 individuals for election at this year's AGM to two-year terms. In addition to the reelection of Ernie, Jerry, Jose Manuel, Keith, Maurits, Terry, Tom and Tim, the Nominating Committee has proposed the following individuals for election:  Kaushik Amin, Managing Director at Lehman Brothers NY, co-head of their global fixed income division.  Fred Janbon, Global Head of Fixed Income at BNP Paribas, London  Azam Mistry, Director, Head of Risk Management Advisor--Treasury and Capital Markets, HSBC, Hong Kong, and Co-Chair of our Asia-Pacific Steering Committee  Thank you to everyone on the nominating commitee for your efforts, particularly those of you who had an opportunity to meet these and other prospective nominees.   Citigroup   The Nominating Committee chose not to nominate anyone from Citigroup for election at this year's AGM. We have emphasized to Citigroup that this decision is due to a variety of factors, including lack of attendance at Board meetings by current and past Board members and the fact that Citi has had a seat on the Board continuously since the Association was formed. We have encouraged them to remain involved in ISDA activities with a view to rejoining the Board at the earliest possible juncture. Please encourage your Citigroup counterparts to get involved or remain involved in the Association's activities.   Both Ravit and Thierry Sciard, who contacted us to offer himself as an alternative for the position, were upset by the decision, but it is not clear what the long-term effects will be. The most immediate tangible effect is that Citi has indicated that it is withdrawing its co-sponsorship of the Tuesday and Wednesday evening events at the Washington AGM. There is a possibility that Lehman may be interested in sponsorship.   Board Meeting Schedule   Please make note of the Board meeting schedule for the remainder of the year:  April 4 and 5 (over lunch each day at the AGM in Washington)  May 16-17 in Kyoto (more details below)  September 12 in London  November 13 in New York (note this is a change from prior schedules distributed)  Strategic Planning Session   May 16 and 17 are the dates of our strategic planning session, which this year will be at the Miyako Hotel in Kyoto. The details on the Miyako Hotel are:  MIYAKO HOTEL Sanjo Keage Kyoto 605-0052 Japan Phone: 81 75 771 7111 Fax: 81 75 751 2490 http:/www.miyakohotel.co.jp   The schedule is slightly different from past sessions. I will provide more details on the specifics, but for your planning purposes, you should arrange to be in Kyoto for lunch on Wednesday, May 16. (Bullet trains from Tokyo that morning will get you there in time.) We will have dinner in the hotel Wednesday evening after our afternoon session. On Thursday, May 17, we will start with breakfast and have a working lunch, with the session ending around 2:00. The afternoon will be spent visiting temples and perhaps going on a sake tasting tour. (Fortunately, I do not believe that Francis Ford Coppola is a sake producer.) Dinner that evening will be at a restaurant and will be accompanied by a Geisha dance. Please plan to stay for all of the events. There is nothing planned for Friday so that everyone (particularly the Europeans) can get planes out of Osaka or Tokyo on Friday morning that will get them back for the weekend.   Pre-Strategic Planning Luncheons   As in the past we will hold a series of luncheons in London, New York and Tokyo where we will invite senior executives from member firms to share with us their thoughts on issues affecting the industry. The tentative schedule and locations for these lunches is as follows:  Wednesday, May 2    London    UBS (hosted by Tim Frederickson)  Friday, May 11            New York    AIG (hosted by Ernie Patrikis)  Tuesday, May 15        Tokyo         Royal Park Hotel (hosted by Koshikawa-san)  In addition to attending the luncheon closest to your office, please consider arriving in Tokyo a day early to join us at the Tokyo session. Again, more details will follow. In the meantime, I would welcome any suggestions for individuals we should invite to these luncheons in the various centers.   I know this is a long email, but it covers the critical dates for the coming months in one fell swoop.

Mark     Edmund Cooper  02/21/2001 12:23 PM        To: ECT London European Trading, T Paul Johnson/EU/Enron@Enron, Janet  Wood/EU/Enron@Enron, Matthew Dawson/LON/ECT@ECT, Michael Slade/LON/ECT@ECT,  Jonathan Marsh/EU/Enron@Enron, Mark Evans/Legal/LON/ECT@ECT    cc:     Subject: Change to standard ISDA Schedule  Dear All,  In the course of current ISDA Master Agreement negotiations with an  Australian counterparty it has come to my attention that the ISDA netting  opinion for Australia specifies that certain Sections of the ISDA Master  should not be altered; otherwise reliance on the opinion, and close-out  netting, could be jeopardised.  In particular the opinion specifies that  Section 2(a)(iii) should not be altered.    Enron has a standard alteration to Section 2(a)(iii) in Part 5 of its  standard form Schedule, viz.    ""(a) Conditions Precedent.  The condition precedent set forth in clause (1)  of Section 2(a)(iii) shall not apply to payments owed by a party if the other  party shall have satisfied in full all its payment obligations under Section  2(a)(i) and shall at the relevant time have no future payment obligations  whether absolute or contingent, under Section 2(a)(i).""  Obviously, in the case of Australian counterparties this condition precedent  should not be included in our documentation.  In addition, there are a number of other countries (including Germany, Italy,  South Korea and Switzerland) where the effectiveness of the ISDA netting  opinion presupposes that certain Sections of the Master, including Section  2(a)(iii), are not altered in any material respect. To that end I would  suggest that our standard condition precedent does make a material alteration  and that it should not be included in ISDA Master Agreements with  counterparties trading from these jurisdictions.  Certainly from the London end, I think that when we start negotiations with a  new counterparty we should check the ISDA opinions to ensure that we don't  trip ourselves up.

My  suggestion is to automatically allow ICC arbitration (English or Portuguese)  in Sao Paulo for deals out to 4-5 years and smaller than 200 average  megawatts, with a case-by-case review for deals of longer maturity or larger  average capacity.  I appreciate the fact that this requires some discussion  of company policy, and I am grateful for any help you can give.   I strongly  believe that we will not be able to prosecute  a successful trading operation  without a meaningful dispute resolution forum in Sao Paulo.

Mark     Stuart Zisman  02/23/2001 04:17 PM        To: Mark E Haedicke/HOU/ECT@ECT    cc: Don Miller/HOU/ECT@ECT    Subject: Request for permission  Mark,  I am currently negotiating an Option to Obtain an Easement in connection with  our peaking power plant in Caledonia, Mississippi.  As you know, the  Caledonia facility is currently scheduled to be sold to Cinergy Capital &  Trading, Inc.  The anticipated closing date is March 27, 2001 (but this is  subject to change depending on when we obtain the requisite regulatory  approval).  One of the things that ENA was seeking to do, prior to deciding to sell the  plant, was to establish a second interconnection to the Southern Company  (currently Caledonia is interconnected to TVA).  In pursuit of this second  interconnection, certain ENA developers were charged with the responsibility  for obtaining options for easements.  The easements were needed in order to  run the transmission wires from the plant to the point of the interconnection  with Southern.  To date, we have obtained all but one of the required options  (the ""Galiano Option"").  We are obligated to cooperate with Cinergy from now until the closing date in  pursuit of the Galiano Option.  Ms. Galiano and her lawyer have insisted upon  adding an indemnity in the form of easement which requires the grantee  (Caledonia Power I, LLC) to indemnify the grantor against liabilities arising  from grantee's use of the easement.  They have adamantly rejected, however,  my request that the indemnification be limited to actual damages (and that  special, consequential and punitive damages be waived).    Cinergy has asked us to execute the Galiano Option without the waiver of  consequential damages and I am seeking your permission to do so.  I think that this should be acceptable from ENA's perspective for several  reasons:  1)  It is likely (99%+) that we sell Caledonia Power I, LLC (the proposed  counterparty to the Galiano Option) in the next several weeks; 2)  The Galiano Option is structured as an option to obtain an easement and  the waiver of consequential damages issue only arises if the option is  actually exercised; and  3)  If for some odd reason the sale doesn't go through, we finally decide to  complete the second interconnection and we exercise the option for easement,  we can probably mitigate our risk by procuring additional insurance.  Please let me know, at your earliest possible convenience, if I may proceed  with the execution of the Galiano Option.  Many thanks.

AIG Declines to Pay Flashpoint Bonds, Triggers 18-Notch S&P Cut 2/8/1 13:3 (New York)  AIG Declines to Pay Flashpoint Bonds, Triggers 18-Notch S&P Cut       London, Feb. 8 (Bloomberg) -- A pair of ``AAA''-rated bonds issued by Flashpoint Ltd. suffered an 18-notch downgrade by Standard & Poor's after a unit of American International Group Inc. said it won't pay on insurance that guarantees the bonds.      The $149.1 million of bonds, named Hollywood Funding No. 5. and No. 6, were sold by the U.K. company to finance films and television shows. S&P assigned its top rating to the securities because they're guaranteed by Lexington Insurance Co., a subsidiary of AIG, the world's largest insurer.      Investors who bought the zero-coupon bonds were to be repaid by the revenue from a basket of films. When the films didn't make enough to cover those payments, the insurance policy was designed to kick in. Lexington, though, said it won't cover the shortfall because the film company broke its contract. Now, S&P regards the bonds as ``vulnerable to nonpayment,'' and rates them ``CCC-.''      ``There has never been a downgrade of that magnitude in Europe,'' said Kurt Sampson, head of structured finance ratings at S&P. ``We are voicing our concern about the implications for the capital markets. The degree of our concern is evident by the fact we are going public with this.''      S&P, which downgraded the Hollywood bonds on Friday, said Lexington's actions have prompted it to review other securities insured by Lexington in case the insurer seeks to ``raise defenses to the payment'' due on other bonds.      Joe Norton, AIG's spokesman, said the company won't comment on the bonds. Graham Johnson at Flagship Group, which handles press communications for Flashpoint, said the company regards the bonds as ``not a matter that it's appropriate for them to comment on.'' Credit Suisse First Boston, which managed the private sale of Flashpoint's six Hollywood Funding bonds, also declined to comment.                           Cash Shortfall       Hollywood Funding No. 5, a $48.4 million dollar bond, was due to be repaid on Jan. 5, according to people familiar with the security. Bondholders haven't been paid, and agreed to wait for two months before triggering a default because Lexington is investigating whether the issuer broke its contract with the insurer, S&P said.      ``The policies were to provide for sufficient funds to pay the notes in full, should revenues in the trustee's other accounts be insufficient,'' S&P said. ``S&P believed that the original policies'' would pay out under any circumstances, ``and that any such matters were not supposed to constitute a defense to payment on the policies.''      S&P's defines ``AAA'' ratings as those applying to issuers with an ``extremely strong'' ability to meet their obligations.      The rating company also said that Lexington won't be meeting shortfalls on Hollywood Funding No. 6, a $100.7 million bond maturing on June 18, because the issuer broke its contract by not making as many films at it agreed to.  --Alice James in the London newsroom (44) 207 330 7195, or ajames@bloomberg.net, with reporting by Sean Farrell /mg  Story illustration: {HOLFUN 0 6/18/01 <Corp> DES <GO>} for the terms of one of the bonds.

We will certainly be taking le= ss=20 than 15% of  BE, but it is not clear to me what the size of our investment = is=20 likely to be.   (Richard?).  Lance, you mentioned that if the shares are being acquired for ""investment= =20 purposes only"" then we would be exempt from these requirements.  Presumably= =20 this is in addition to the size requirements mentioned above.  My=20 understanding is that our stake would be purely for investment purposes -= =20 essentially to hedge our trading position should the price of power go up,= =20 and that we are not looking to acquire BE (or a substantial stake in BE)=20 which is in the same sector as Enron.

"Peter:  As we have discussed, I think we probably need someone other than Dan.  I  don't think there is any need to lay everything out on use of lawyers in  Canada.  I agree with your comments on the business model for lawyers.  We  can't ignore that.  Let's generally talk that through with Jim.  Regards,  Mark     Peter Keohane  03/07/2001 08:46 AM        To: Mark E Haedicke/HOU/ECT@ECT    cc:     Subject: Canadian Counsel  Mark, a few thoughts:  1.  Dan Fournier asked me to go to lunch so he could update me on his ""very  positive meeting"" with Jim and you.  I told Dan, politely, that I am very  tired of talking to the issue and really have nothing more to add.  I hope  that is OK with you.  To be honest, I am really tired of talking to the issue  and dealing with Dan Fournier's political maneuvering, but I am also  concerned that it seems apparent that the result of his meeting with you and  Jim is that he thinks he is back in the saddle with Enron.  I have lost trust  and confidence in Dan Fournier and as I mentioned Dan's approach within  Blakes becomes exclusive and results in inefficient allocation of Blakes  resources to our files.  He tries to conquer the client and thereby alienates  the talent within his firm.  I know for a fact, after he has squeezed others  out on our work and his mismanagement of this issue with Enron, that if Dan  is back in the saddle, many of his partners will not been keen on doing our  work under Dan's terms.  I also know that there is a philosophy in Houston to  commercial people not having say in legal retainers, but I believe that the  senior commercial people who are responsible for the transactions,  particularly in a smaller office in a smaller market, have an important place  in the relationship, and in that regard, I know Fournier has lost the trust  and confidence of Rob Milnthorp.  2.  Regarding Donahue Ernst and Young, it should be borne in mind that the  initial contact to doing work at their firm was through Jordan Mintz and  Morris Clark on the tax side.  I also know Jordan thinks well not just of  their firm but of the multidisciplinary business model.  I also think that  Jim needs to understand that the business model is likely not going away, and  likely to expand in Canada, the US and Europe and is something we likely  cannot ignore.  Also, the circumstances you will recall for us using DEY  initially was on regulatory and contracting issues affecting the retail  market, where the incumbent firms with any experience in the area were all  conflicted and in an area where Blakes is particularly weak in Calgary.  (We  first approached Stikemans, which had conflict with Enmax, and Bennett Jones,  which had a conflict with ATCO.  Other firms which we do not typically use  but which had experience also had conflicts.  After that, I solicited written  propsals from both Blakes and DEY and interviewed with them with the retail  team.)  Frankly, DEY has done good work for us.  E&Y is also very well  situated on the market development side in Ontario, a leading proponent of  deregulation of the Ontario market, and worked with us to set up our systems  in Toronto for market opening.  3.  Should I e-mail to Jim a proposed agenda for our call on the 20th  outlining the firms we currently use in different capacities in Canada?   Blakes, Bennett Jones, Stikemans, Oslers, Donahue E&Y, or is a less structurd  call anticipated?  Peter.   Peter.

But I had the pleasure of meeting you when I was attending a SAP training course in 2000 when I was in Houston. I worked for the Legal Departament in the Sao Paulo office and had been developing a good job (at least my performance evaluations said so) when I was said teh company was firing many people and I was included in the fatal list. My immediate supervisors tried to do everything they could to keep me there and all the answers were no. I want you to know that this message is not to complain about my firing. Everyone who works is subject to this fact, specially in Brazil. I simply became astonished when I was told that two people are being hired for the same position I had less than 2 months after I left the company. So, my question is WHY? Why and how does Enron commit such a mistake? I really trusted the company I used to work for, I really enjoyed working for Enron and why? Why did Enron fired me and two months later started hiring two others for the same position? How can such a big company like Enron be so unreasonalble and why not to say insensitive?  Sorry for this emotional words but I had to say that.

Until that is complete, however, Sami & John have identified the  following spot market contracts as needing immediate approval for dispute  resolution clauses agreeing to ICC administered arbitration in Sao Paulo or  Rio.  As you are aware, this is somewhat contrary to our traditional policy  for out of country ICC arbitration.  The counter parties in these  transactions will not agree to arbitration outside Brazil.  Given the nature  of these contracts, I believe ICC administered arbitration in Brazil is an  acceptable means for dispute resolution.  I've discussed this with Rob and he  is in agreement subject to your approval.

There are deals which  were ""closed"" last year (""closing"" meaning that price, MWh volume, term,  power profile, center of gravity etc were agreed upon between the contracting  entities).  Some of these MWh's have already been physically traded but MAE  haven't yet calculated the system's settlement.

Some of the above listed deals are 1QTR commercial priorities and I need to  know if you would be OK with Enron's Marketing Co (ECE) using  ICC-administered or FIESP-administered (as a second alternative) arbitration  under ICC Rules in S?o Paulo as the PPA's dispute resolution mechanism.

TRAVEL DISPATCH offers you a jump on special travel deals and news.  http://email.nytimes.com/email/email.jsp?eta5  \----------------------------------------------------------/  Companies Turn to Grades, and Employees Go to Court   By REED ABELSON  An increasingly popular technique for evaluating employees is prompting lawsuits charging discrimination at three big companies.   At issue is the ranking of managers, professionals and sometimes lower-level employees from best to worst, or grading them on a bell curve, and then using that ranking to help determine pay and sometimes whether to fire someone.   In their suits, all filed over the last year or so, employees at Microsoft, Ford Motor and Conoco say the rating systems are unfair because they favor some groups of employees over others: white males over blacks and women, younger managers over older ones and foreign citizens over Americans.   A growing number of companies are turning to grading systems, also known as forced rankings or distributions, as a way of making sure managers evaluate employees honestly and make clearer distinctions among them. At companies that do not compare employees with one another this way, nearly every employee can come away feeling above average, like the children of Lake Wobegon. But under the grading system, managers are forced to identify some people as low performers.   At General Electric, for example, supervisors identify the top 20 percent and bottom 10 percent of their managerial and professional employees every year. The bottom 10 percent are not likely to stay.   As John F. Welch Jr., General Electric's chief executive, wrote last month to shareholders, ""A company that bets its future on its people must remove that lower 10 percent, and keep removing it every year =01* always raising the bar of performance and increasing the quality of its leadership.""   Ranking or grading employees is also common at technology companies like Cisco Systems and Hewlett- Packard. But recently the concept has been catching on more broadly, according to management consultants. One reason is that as the economy slows, companies often lay off employees. Cisco, for example, announced earlier this month that it would let go as many as 5,000 workers =01* and would use grading as one way to identify people to lay off.   ""Companies are playing their version of `Survivor,' "" said David Thomas, a professor at the Harvard Business School.   Another reason is that some companies are eager to copy Mr. Welch, long viewed as one of the most successful managers in America.   Defenders of these systems say anyone who gets a low grade is likely to view the process as unfair. "" `A' students love grades; `F' students hate grades,"" said John Sullivan, a human resources professor at San Francisco State University.   But the techniques, which some employees label with terms like ""rank and yank,"" have come under sharp criticism. While they appear to offer an objective way to judge employees, they can be vulnerable to bias, Mr. Thomas said. Managers may stereotype employees when evaluating them on vague criteria like career potential =01* deciding that older workers, for example, may have a harder time keeping up with new technology.   In some cases managers can view these systems ""as a tool to be used to weed out the ones you don't want,"" said Thomas S. McLeod, a lawyer in Canton, Mich., who represents employees suing Ford in another case.   Critics of the system also argue that companies should not apply a bell curve, in which a small number of employees get the highest and lowest rankings and a much larger number are grouped in the middle. The bell curve model assumes a normal distribution among a very large group of random individuals, not small groups.   What is more, across a company, people who belong to a particularly talented unit will suffer if a certain number of them must be given poorer grades than they would get in another unit.   ""You end up with dysfunctional results,"" said Edward E. Lawler III, a business professor at the University of Southern California.   Some lawsuits contend that Microsoft's grading systems are discriminatory. One, filed last October, seeks class-action status on behalf of blacks and women. The suit states that the rating system ""permits managers, who are predominantly white males, to rate employees based upon their own biases rather than based upon merit.""   According to the lawsuit, employees are rated on a five-point scale, with only a certain percentage permitted to receive each score. Employees doing the same job in the same unit are also given a ""stack ranking,"" from most to least valuable. Managers decide those rankings largely using what are called ""lifeboat discussions,"" where they choose which employees they would want with them if stuck in a lifeboat. Managers had no other clear criteria, according to Christine Webber, a lawyer at Cohen, Milstein, Hausfeld & Toll who is representing the employees.   Grading is highly subjective at Microsoft, according to Peter M. Browne, a former executive who is also suing the company, charging discrimination. Mr. Browne, who is black, said managers were forced to use a curve in evaluating even small groups. He said he had to rate a group of five on a curve, for example, in deciding which ones would not receive stock options.   ""You weren't told anything =01* just meet the curve,"" Mr. Browne said.   He says managers ended up favoring people with whom they socialized. ""People gravitate to people who are like them, and the system just forces that,"" he said.   Microsoft defends its system as fair and helpful. ""We want to give the highest compensation to the very top performers,"" said Deborah Willingham, senior vice president for human resources, adding that the system included checks and balances to ensure fair treatment. Employees can appeal their ratings, for example, and are largely responsible for developing the criteria by which they are evaluated.   Ms. Willingham also said the company did not ask its managers to give a fixed percentage of their employees any given score. ""We don't force that curve to look any certain way,"" she said.   Microsoft has no formal ""stack rank"" policy, she said. And when managers do have lifeboat discussions, they are a tool to consider which employees they would want to keep if they were starting again.   While the company would not comment on the lawsuits, Microsoft ""expressly prohibits discrimination,"" Ms. Willingham said.   Similar criticisms emerged in a lawsuit brought last month against Ford. It argues that the company's new grading system discriminates against older workers. The company, which adopted what it calls its performance management process a year ago, gives its 18,000 managers A, B or C grades. Last year, the company awarded 10 percent an A, 80 percent a B and 10 percent a C.   Ford also faces a second lawsuit asserting that it unfairly discriminated against older white males in its grading.It would not comment on the litigation but defended its use of grades. ""We believe the system is fair and nondiscriminatory,"" a company spokeswoman said. ""We are in a very competitive industry, and we need all of our employees to be the best they can be.""   At Conoco, employees contend that the company discriminated against United States citizens and older workers when it laid off a dozen geophysicists and other scientists in 1999 based on a ranking from one to four, according to a lawsuit filed last year. The majority of those let go were Americans, according to the suit, as opposed to British, Norwegian and Canadian professionals.   ""The rating system was selectively enforced, and there were instances of manipulation,"" said John Zavitsanos, the lawyer representing the workers. Even though some were given higher ratings on earlier rankings, they were eventually given the lowest possible rating of four.   Conoco, based in Houston, has extensive operations in the North Sea, and many of the senior managers at the division in question are British, according to Mr. Zavitsanos.   While Conoco said it could not comment on the litigation, it said its evaluations were based on several factors, including performance, skills and expertise. The company said ratings often changed as more information was collected and people were evaluated in larger groups. Conoco company also denied that decisions were based on anything other than individual capabilities.   Companies ""do need something in making pay decisions, downsizing decisions,"" said Jim Kochanski, a consultant with Nextera Enterprises. The problem is that companies may not take enough care in deciding how people should be ranked. ""They can get it very wrong,"" he said.            http://www.nytimes.com/2001/03/19/business/19GRAD.html?ex=3D986016138&ei=3D= 1&en=3De2 02a0228246c717  /-----------------------------------------------------------------\   Visit NYTimes.com for complete access to the most authoritative news coverage on the Web, updated throughout the day.

OEC provided operational support to some, but not all  Enron assets.  Second, the clear need for both the engineering and  operational resources was in Wholesale not Retail (EES).  There will be some  need to help EES bridge into Industrial clients, but this need is minor  compared to the requirements of Wholesale.  As a benefit of the time Mark and  Dan plus other Executive Committee Members put into the decision  to form  EEOS, we believe we are correctly positioned to effectively address Enron's  major project needs.  Our Thursday meeting is an open forum to discuss these  and other issues you might have with our new or perhaps more clearly defined  position.    We look forward to seeing you on Thursday.

"I don't have a problem with it, subject to our normal litigation exception.   Mark     ""JOHN G KLAUBERG"" <JKLAUBER@LLGM.COM>  03/14/2001 06:04 PM        To: Mark.E.Haedicke@enron.com    cc:     Subject: Conflicts Question   Mark:  I am attaching a copy of a brief memo I received from one of my partners in  our Houston office about a potential representation of a company called  Centrans, which apparently is a partner with Enron in a Guatemala power  project.  Centrans apparently plans to sell a piece of its interest to a  Fund, in which Enron also owns and interest (although I do not know how much). We would represent Centrans in selling its interest to the Fund.  I am not  sure, but I do not get the sense from my conversation with my partner that  Enron plans to take an active role in the Fund purchase.  So, from a  conflicts analytical standpoint, this would seem to be analogous to LeBoeuf  representing a buyer in connection with the sale of an asset to a corporation  in which Enron is a shareholder.  Do you have any concerns with LeBoeuf representing Centrans on this sale?   Are there any unique facts or circumstances here that you may be aware of  that could create a potential problem from your standpoint?  I assume this  transaction would fall within your ""world"" but, if not, is there somebody  else that I should check with on this?  We understand that Thelen Reid &  Priest is representing the Fund.

" Just keeping you in the loop.  Let me know if you need any help on this.   -----Original Message----- From:  Sherrick, Jeffrey   Sent: Tuesday, March 20, 2001 4:40 PM To: Aronowitz, Alan; Wallace, Stephen; Walls, Rob Cc: Carolan, Dominic; Chatham, Gerry Subject: Carolan redeployment to LNG group  I am very pleased that Dominic has been offered an opportunity to re-deploy  from EGEP to the LNG legal group upon the completion of his current  assignment in the disposition of Enron's China E&P assets.  As you know, we  have been going through the data-room process and we will be calling for  final bids on April 9th.  Dominic is finalizing the draft PSA and associated  bidding documents at this time.  We plan to distribute a copy of such to all  potential bidders by the end of the week.  At this time we have 15 companies that have signed the CA and are at various  stages in the evaluation process.  We believe we have 7-8 serious bidders and  we hope to get at least 3-4 bids submitted on the 9th.  To complicate the  process a little, we have 3 majors seriously evaluating both the E&P  properties and the old EI China pipeline project.  We are coordinating with  Chris Hunt, Bill Krenz and Keith Stepp on the integrated sale of both assets  with this select group of companies.  In addition to the  current drafting  work, we will have a few additional data-room visitors prior to the 9th, due  diligence requests and, of course, definitive agreement negotiations to  conclude before the process is complete.  The reason I outlined the above is to give all concerned parties a feel for  the process we need Dominic to participate in (to varying degrees) until it  is concluded.  There will be times where this project will require 100% of  his time for several days and then other times where there will be a few days  with no pressing issues.  However, to avoid any confusion over the next  couple of months I thought it would be a good idea to lay out a few ground  rules for Dominic's time.  1) EGEP supports Dominic re-deploying to the LNG group and will strive to get  him 100% transferred as soon as practical. 2) During the next couple of months Dominic will have some ""dead time"" in the  China disposition and during this time we are supportive of Dominic spending  time with the LNG group, getting up to speed with the activities in the group  and taking on low-priority assignments that could be delayed if his time was  needed in the sale process. 3) The only assignment Dominic has to complete with EGEP is the sale of the  China assets.  There will be no future assignments. 4) Until EGEP senior management releases Dominic to the LNG group, his  primary responsibility will be the China sale and this activity will take  precedence over any other assignments. 5) Until EGEP senior management releases Dominic to the LNG group, his  primary office will remain in 3 Allen Center with EGEP.  He is expected to  report to 3 Allen Center and the daily 8:30 am disposition meeting to  ascertain any sale related needs for his time.  This meeting usually lasts  for 30-45 minutes and if there are no issues he can report to the LNG group.  In some ways I know this appears to be a little silly.  However, I also know  that if we don't set out a few rules we will encounter a problem and it is  not fair to Dominic or in Enron's best interest to let Dominic take on two  ""A-priority"" projects at this time.  We need his services to successfully  sell this project. Unfortunately, we can not schedule when certain activities  will be needed, but we will be reasonable whenever possible to allow for a  smooth effort in both groups.  During the next couple of months I'm sure  Dominic will be a very positive addition to your staff in spite of the time  allocated to the China sale effort.  He has been a very productive and  valuable employee for our group and I am very glad Enron found a way to  retain his services.  If you have any questions please give me a call.  Thanks for your support  during this short-term need in our group.  We will try to make this  inconvenience as small as possible.  jeff ",mark.haedicke@enron.com,rob.walls@enron.com,FW: Carolan redeployment to LNG group,2001-03-21 01:30:00-08:00,received
"We have spoken about this before, the issue is that Enron Americas has no  approval mechanism for contracts. Neither does any other group but that is  not my problem.  I have spent too much time reading DASH forms which really  do not provide full authorization.

So if a DASH is signed then this authorizes all of the  contracts to be signed in the deal.  Any contracts which are not included  need to go through the process outlined below.

"Bob:  I am going to pass on the playoff tickets.  Thanks.   Mark     ""Baird, Bob"" <RBaird@velaw.com>  03/27/2001 01:45 PM        To: ""Haedicke, Mark (Enron North America Corp.)""  <mark.e.haedicke@enron.com>, ""Rob Walls (E-mail)"" <rob_walls@enron.com>    cc:     Subject: Rockets Playoff Tickets - Response needed this week.  Mark and Rob:   Rockets have been looking good (despite the recent slump) and have a chance to make the playoffs.  (I heard on the radio this morning that Hakeem may be back.)     So the Rockets have sent out invoices for playoff tickets.  We are supposed to respond by this Friday, March 30.   This year (perhaps because they know there's a decent chance they won't make the playoffs) the Rockets are invoicing playoff tickets in two installments. The first installment covers rounds one and two, and the second covers the Western Conference Finals and the NBA Championship.   I can't tell whether if you commit for the first two rounds you have a legal obligation to buy the second and third if they make it to the Western Conference Finals, but I assume that doesn't matter (we should assume that a commitment now means a financial commitment for the entire playoffs).   Rounds 1 and 2 encompass 6 games.  $549 per seat, or $2,196 total.  That's two games in Round 1 at $88.50 per ticket, and four games in Round 2 at $93.00 per ticket.   Rounds 3 and 4 (which we wouldn't have to pay for until later) are $916 per seat, or $3,664.  I assume that Rounds 3 and 4 will include 8 games.   For the regular season I had 6/44 of the tickets, which is 13.6%.  That's approximately 1 ticket in Rounds 1 and 2 and 1 ticket in Rounds 3 and 4. I'd be glad to spring for that, although if you all want all the playoff tickets that's fine also.   So I suppose how much it's going to cost each of you depends on whether my ticket is Round 1 or 2.  If it's in round 2 each of you would pay $912 for the first two rounds, and if it's in round 1 each of you would pay $921.  If the two of you want all the playoff tickets, each of you would pay $1,098 for Rounds 1 and 2.   This year the Rockets are saying that if the tickets are not used you can ask for a refund by the same means that you paid.  So what I would propose to do it put all the charges on my credit card and if they don't make the playoffs that charge will be reversed; and it may not even make it on my bill if they don't make the playoffs.   Since I will put it on my card I won't need your money until about the 20th of April.   So please let me know if you want to commit and whether you want me to take a ticket out of each of the sets of rounds. (I'm fine either way)      Robert S. Baird  Vinson & Elkins L.L.P.

Normally the election o the Board members takes place at the annual Ordinary Shareholder's meeting. (This year, our OGM is scheduled to take place on April, 29th.) However this matter  can also be decided at any time via an Extraordinary Shareholder's Meeting  that has to be called trough a  Board Resolution that  has to be publicized at the Official Gazette no later than 8 days prior to date of such EGM.

So if a DASH is signed then this authorizes all of the  contracts to be signed in the deal.  Any contracts which are not included  need to go through the process outlined below.  (ii) All contracts need a Contract Approval Form attached and Enron's legal  team cannot initial any contract until this form has been completed (ie  signed) by the following Enron staff.

"Louise:  Is Enron ready for this?  I think it is a good suggestion for the most significant deals.

Neither does any other group but that is not my problem.  I have spent too much time reading DASH forms which really do not provide full authorization.  There are two suggestions that I would like to be implemented:  (i) DASH forms need to include all of the contracts which are to be signed under the deal.  So if a DASH is signed then this authorizes all of the contracts to be signed in the deal.  Any contracts which are not included need to go through the process outlined below.  (ii) All contracts need a Contract Approval Form attached and Enron's legal team cannot initial any contract until this form has been completed (ie signed) by the following Enron staff.  Trader/Originator ________________________________ Head of Group (VP or above)______________________ Credit__________________________________________ Legal__________________________________________ Tech Services (where applicable)__________________ Commercial Support (where applicable)_____________  A database of all completed contracts on behalf of Enron Americas needs to be maintained by Legal.

Thank you. Jim   -----Original Message----- From:  Paul Johnson, T   Sent: Monday, March 26, 2001 12:15 PM To: Sanders, Richard Cc: Derrick Jr., James; Evans, Mark Subject: Litigation report  A number of pieces of on going litigation and arbitration being conducted on  behalf of EML and EMC have very recently come to our attention which we  summarise below. We have endeavoured to establish the detail of these cases  as quickly as possible, but in some instances await information from outside  counsel involved. The summary is therefore necessarily provisional, and will  need to be supplemented. There are in addition other claims of which we have  been made aware, largely being run by MG Hong Kong and Beijing offices.  Details are presently so sketchy that we have not included them until we have  been able to verify. A supplementary note on these will follow asap.  1. Corporacion Nacional del  Cobre de Chile (""Codelco"" )  v.  MG Ltd, MGAG  and MGCC  This is a major, and very serious claim being brought by the Chilean state  copper trading company Codelco against, primarily MG AG of Frankfurt, but  also against MG Ltd (now Enron Metals Ltd) for recission of futures contracts  on the basis that they were procured by fraud (a bribe of US$1.5m paid to the  main Codelco trader by MGAG). We have received a brief summary of the claim  from Slaughter & May, the lawyers handling the litigation on behalf of EML,  which is attached below. As a result of an indemnity from MG AG, MG Ltd has  NO financial exposure other than a credit risk to MG AG.  Legal professional privilege must of course be maintained for this document  and its contents, and any dissemination outside the legal dept should be made  subject to prior approval by legal.  Trial is set down in the Chancery Division of the High Court in London for  5-6 weeks, commencing October 2001. Significantly, and as you will be aware,  High Court proceedings take place in public.   - LT010810084_3.doc   2. MG Ltd v. China Resources National Corporation  Claim in LME arbitration for payment of US$6m futures losses on client  contracts. Award published in favour of MGL on liability alone in August  2000. Damages to be assessed. Thereafter Award to be enforced in China.  Solicitors: Clyde & Co.   3. MG Ltd v. London Clearing House  Claim in LME arbitration for delivery of defective tin under warrant. Losses  believed to be US$800,000. 7 day time bar defence run by the LCH heard as  preliminary issue. Award in approx Feb 2000 in favour of MG (ie time bar  inapplicable). This has led to resumption of settlement negotiations with  Standard Chartered Bank (trading), who put the metal onto warrant originally  (and against whom the LCH would have an indemnity claim). The most recent  offer from Standard Chartered is to pay US$437,000; but this is subject to  unacceptable conditions. Solicitors: Allen & Overy.  4. Nickel explosion in furnace in Cleveland: Scandia Transport   LMEWarehouse/LCH/EMC/Phoenix /EAC/ Cast Alloys (smelter)  Contaminated nickel supplied by EMC into the US. Amount of loss being  established now. Incident much less bad than initial reports suggested, and  have therefore deferred explosion survey/investigation lined up on urgent  basis earlier this week. Expect indemnity claim to be brought against EMC by  Phoenixx in LME arbitration; and to pass same claim on to the LCH. Assume  possibility of US tort claim also lying direct from Smelter to EMC (awaiting  advice from Limor Nissan/Andy Edison on this). Facts should become  sufficiently clear to enable rough quantification within next week (w/c 26/3).  NB. Other similarly contaminated shipments from the same warehouse are known  to exist. Warnings to other customers are being prepared.  5. LME arbitration: Chinese receiver/ICD/Brandeis/EMC/EML/LCH/Warehouse  Claim brought by Chinese receivers for supply of defective nickel on LME  warrant bought through London clearing. Only US$62,000 claim, but involves  significant point of principle, hence decision taken to proceed in  arbitration. Should in principle be able to pass on incoming claim to LCH  (and beyond). Expect unrecoverable costs (internal and external) to exceed  the amount of the claim. Solicitors to be instructed w/c 26/3.

I think it is a good policy, although I am still not as convinced  as Sami is that the courts in Brazil will so cavalierly disregard  international arbitration provisions. Nevertheless, I think it was necessary  to change our policy from a commercial perspective; we were getting too much  resistance to foreign arbitration.  Now the question is, do we go the next  step and see if Jim will approve submitting to the jurisdiction of some  courts in Brazil which are generally reliable and free of corruption (e.g.,  Sao Paulo and Rio) if the counterparty rejects arbitration, and the largest  sum of money that would ever be in dispute would be less than $500,000?

"The Brazilian arbitration statute is only four years old, so arbitration is  still somewhat of a new concept.  However, businesspeople in the more  sophisticated commercial centers (Sao Paulo and Rio) are comfortable with it,  as are those companies that have been involved in international projects, are  subsidiaries of multi-national companies, or that have relied on offshore  financing.  Governmental and quasi-governmental entities, including  utilities, have been resistant to it, in part because there is language in  the Brazilian Constituition that could be interpreted to forbid waiving  resort to the courts where natural resources (""patrimonial rights"") are  involved.  I think where we will get pushback on this policy is with respect  to the language of the arbitration and the ICC.  For that reason, I suggest  we go ahead and ""pre-qualify"" the acceptance of Portugese for contacts where  less than $5 million is involved, and the acceptance of alternative arbitral  bodies (the Canadian Chamber of Commerce and perhaps FIESP) where less than  $3 million is involved.     -----Original Message----- From:  Haedicke, Mark   Sent: Tuesday, April 03, 2001 10:50 AM To: Williams, Robert C.

Nevertheless, I think it was necessary  to change our policy from a commercial perspective; we were getting too much  resistance to foreign arbitration.  Now the question is, do we go the next  step and see if Jim will approve submitting to the jurisdiction of some  courts in Brazil which are generally reliable and free of corruption (e.g.,  Sao Paulo and Rio) if the counterparty rejects arbitration, and the largest  sum of money that would ever be in dispute would be less than $500,000?

In order to reduce Enron's non-market risks ( e.g. legal, credit  and regulatory) in the volatile commodity markets in California or any ""  future California"", we propose the following changes:  1.    Mandatory Uniform Set-Off Provisions in All Trading Contracts for All  Commodities -- set-off language varies commodity by commodity in trading  contracts.  Set-off is one of the most critical tools available to Enron in a  major default situation and it is critical to have set-off language and to  have it be uniform commodity to commodity so that Enron can get the best  advantage from set-off and not just the least common denominator.  2.     Master Netting Agreements For Appropriate Counterparties With Multiple  Masters With Significant Opposite Exposures -- where it is necessary to have  multiple masters with a counterparty, a ""bridge"" should be put in place  between the masters whenever there is significant opposite exposures under  the two or more masters.  3.     Merge EPMI into ENA -- power trades are done through EPMI.  Merging  EPMI into ENA and conducting power trades through ENA is much more efficient  from both a credit and legal point of view.  4.     No Automatic Termination for a Bankruptcy Event -- in the PGE/SCE  situation, it should be the non-defaulting party's (Enron in this case)  option to terminate rather than an automatic termination on ""inability to pay  debts as they become due"".  Let me know if you have any other proposed changes to our trading contracts  or entities through which we conduct our trading.  I believe these changes  will (i) improve efficiency, (ii) reduce risks, (iii) develop the opportunity  to do more business with certain counterparties and (iv) substantially  improve Enron's position in the next California type market.  The long range  goal is to conduct as much as possible of the trading business through a  single entity and a single or limited number of standardized agreements.

Jim   -----Original Message----- From:  Crawford, Sharon   On Behalf Of Keohane, Peter Sent: Tuesday, April 03, 2001 6:15 PM To: Derrick Jr., James; Haedicke, Mark Subject: Canadian Retail  Jim and Mark, as you know, we have established a retail affiliate within  Enron Canada known as Enron Direct.  In addition, EES has a Canadian entity,  EES Canada, which was established for the purposes of entering into some  cross-border transactions in Canada.  For various reasons, it has been  decided to roll Enron Direct into EES Canada reporting, commercially, to Rob  Milnthorp, who will in turn report to Dave Delainey.  There are two  legal/governance-related issues that I wanted to raise with you:  1. Governance:  As a result, it will be necessary to make various corporate  re-organizations to EES Canada.  This will include having EES Canada  established as an Alberta corporation, where Enron Canada has, and Enron  Direct will have, its principal Canadian office.  In relation to this, I was  considering that EES Canada should be organized consistent with Enron Canada,  with two Canadian resident nominee directors and Canadian-resident officers.   A few years back, it was decided, for corporate law and, more importantly,  tax-related ""permanent establishment"" issues, that all directors and officers  of Enron Canada would be Canadian-resident employees of Enron Canada.   Accordingly, Enron Canada was re-organized with a nominee board of directors  consisting of Rob Milnthorp (as the senior commercial employee) and me (as  the senior legal employee) with a Canadian slate of officers being the  Vice-Presidents or Managing Directors in Canada responsible for the various  commercial or commercial-support groups.  I was thinking of doing likewise  with EES Canada.  Although I have not yet obtained a copy of the corporate  records for EES Canada, I believe the current directors of EES Canada are Jim  and an outside lawyer at Blake, Cassels & Graydon in Toronto, Ernest McNee.   I am not sure, but it is also likely that various US-based employees of EES  are designated as the officers of EES Canada.  Would it be appropriate to  re-organize EES Canada along the same lines that Enron Canada has been  organized, or do you have concerns?  2. Law Firm:  Following-up on our conversation last week, I want to confirm  that our continued use of Donahue Ernst & Young for this retail project was  ""grandfathered"" on the basis that they were ""up the learning curve"" on a  number of the contracting, regulatory, licensing and market participation  issues.  There is one twist, however, with respect to EES Canada.  Although I  was not involved, I believe that EES Canada was established to execute on  some gas transactions in Ontario with the use of a Blakes partner in Toronto,  Ernest McNee.  However, as the focus of the business initiative in Canada  will, at least in the near future, be more involved and predominantly, if not  entirely, in Alberta; and as Donahue Ernst & Young is involved in regulatory  proceedings on our behalf with respect to market design issues affecting the  Alberta gas and power markets, as well as being familiar with the licensing  and contracting requirements for Enron Direct in Alberta; and given my  understanding that Blakes' involvement with EES Canada has been relatively  limited, I think it would make sense to have Donahue Ernst & Young continue  on with this matter.  I am, however, sensitive to Jim's concerns, and  therefore wanted your thoughts on the matter.  I look forward to hearing from you.

Subject: IT assistance  Philippe,  I would like to speak to someone in your group who can help us on a specific  request. We've been bogged down over here with commercial disputes, so I have  not been able to keep up with your current organization. If Dan Bruce is  still involved in assisting you, he would be great, or maybe there is someone  else who can help.   In our current dispute with the gov't, we are concerned about possibilities  of raids by gov't to seize documents, files, etc. We are in the process of  removing hard files from India, taking them to our attorneys' offices in  London. However, I am very concerned about electronic files and e-mails and  such related stuff that could also be seized. This is true of servers,  desktops, laptops and other computer devices.  Who can I speak to to get some guidance about how we can very quickly remove  these items from our systems and hardware here in India? My immediate concern  is getting this stuff out of the country as soon as we can. Once out, I can  worry about indexing and making available specific items upon request to  people in India when they need it.  Thanks for your input.

"Sami:  Does this change in treatment of financial trading open up significantly more  trading opportunities for Enron?  Mark     Sami Arap@ENRON  04/16/2001 08:34 AM       To: Mark E Haedicke/HOU/ECT@ECT    cc:     Subject: Re: Financial Trading in Brazil  Mark;  The Brazilian Central Bank created a structure of access to the interest  rate, currency and commodity swaps international market that is based on 3  main points as follows:  payments and receipts arising from hedging modes  (trading on the offshore  stock market as well as on the forward, futures and option markets) as well  as remittances to or from abroad inherent to these transactions (spread,  commissions, premiums and so on) will be effected in foreign currency upon  prompt closing of exchange on the commercial exchange market; remittances intended for the opening of current accounts with brokerage  companies abroad as well as for deposits of collateral margins are permitted;  and upon preliminary approval by the Central Bank, remittances abroad intended  for collateral and escrow deposits linked to interest rate and currency swaps  can be effected.  The key issue of this structure is that the income tax on remittances to  overseas that can be demonstrated to be remittances usual, normal and  necessary for hedging transactions on the international market can be reduced  by 100%.  In addition to any positive results for the foreign institutions  from these operations, the spread, commissions, premiums, and other related  sums. when remitted abroad, will not be subject to any income tax  withholdings.  With respect to the tax treatment of losses that Brazilian  companies may incur as a result of hedging operations, such losses may be  deductible for the purpose of determining taxable profits, only in the event  that they occur in investments on exchanges abroad.  If these transactions  are not carried out on such exchanges, the losses will not be deductible when  determining the taxable profits.  Brazilian entities are not prevented to enter into swap or other derivative  transactions on the international market in case they do not meet the  requirements established above.  The consequences, however, will be the  following:  payments and receipts arising from such transactions as well as remittances  to or from abroad inherent to these transactions could not be effected in  foreign currency upon prompt closing of exchange on the commercial exchange  market, but only through mechanisms available in the or related to the  floating (or ""tourism"") exchange rate; the inflow of foreign currency through the floating rate market would be  subject to IOF (tax on financial transactions) assessed at the rate of 2% on  the Brazilian currency equivalent of the foreign funds entering Brazil; remittance of any amounts that are considered income of a foreign resident  shall be subject to withholding income tax at 15% or at a reduced rate if the  creditor is domiciled in a country  with which Brazil has entered into a  double taxation treaty .

The reason is I am working with a very  successful LBO firm of medium size by French standards.  The project is in  the process of being defined, but it is essentially a web site that brings  together a number of elements of the energy field including electricity, gas  and petroleum.  I would like to find out what the Enron person thinks is  available and what is not available that would be useful.  It might be that  Enron would want to participate in some fashion eventually, but the contact  would not be about that.  It does not matter if it is an English or a French  speaker.  Perhaps they run their presumably modest operation out of some  other place like London.  I would be happy to go wherever the person is.  By  the way, did you see the article in this week's EUW that says there is going  to be an electricity trading market in France starting in May?

As result, a conference call has been scheduled tomorrow at 9:30 a.m.  to discuss the implications of this publication and the merits of objecting  to the request.  My assistant will be sending around shortly an email with a  call-in number for the call.   While we do not have an official translation  of Elektro's response, the following is the best available at present:  1. Other than the dispositions of assets that are part of the ordinary course  operations of Elektro, there is at present no specific intent or decision by  Elektro, or the members of the controlling block of shareholders, to  alienate, in whole or in part, the assets or capital of Elektro.  However,  Elektro and the members of the controlling block of shareholders share Mr.  Skilling's views referenced in your letter of March 22, 2001, wherein he  states that for the right price and under the appropriate circumstances all  assets are for sale.  As a result, preliminary and confidential discussions  with various parties about the possibility of a sale of Elektro have taken  place.  At present, there are no seriously active discussions of this type  taking place.   2. Neither Elektro nor the members of the controlling block of shareholders  have entered into any contract or agreement which commits or obligates, under  any circumstances, Elektro or such shareholders to alienate the assets or  capital of Elektro.  In the event such a contract were to be executed,  Elektro's controlling block of shareholders would notify the CVM in  accordance with Section 5 of CVM Instruction 299.  3. Elektro's program for infrastructure investment is regularly adjusted to  meet the constantly changing demands upon, and forecasts made by, the  company.  Based upon our assumption that your third question is intended to  solicit an answer as to whether this program is any way being adjusted for  reasons other than the needs and forecasts of the company, we can answer that  it is not affected by any such reasons.  Accordingly, we reiterate our  earlier response that Elektro's infrastructure investment program is being  conducted in compliance with all of the applicable regulations and sound  industry practices.

"Looks like a good candidate.  I am around all next week.    Regards,  Mark     Peter Keohane  04/20/2001 03:45 PM        To: Mark E Haedicke/HOU/ECT@ECT    cc: Janette Elbertson/HOU/ECT@ECT, Sharon Crawford/CAL/ECT@ECT    Subject: New Canadian Lawyer  Janette - Can you call Sharon to co-ordinate 5-10 minutes when Mark is  available to discuss the attached.  Mark -  I want to discuss with you a candidate, with the following background  information.  Sorry for the long memo but it might make our discussion more  efficient.  I wanted to see if I could recruit someone with 4-6 years major law firm  experience and whom I knew or could confirm by my contacts as having a  reputation as a quality lawyer and person with broad corporate and commercial  experience.  Perhaps I am getting too far removed from that level, but I was  able to come up with only one candidate that I think is worthy of pursuing.   If he proves unsatisfactory, I will then have to go to an  out-placement/recruitment agency, which is relatively expensive.  That said  the candidate I am suggesting would to my mind be as good or better than any  candidate that we may find through a formal recruitment process.  His name is  Derek Flaman.  I will send his resume to you by fax.  A couple of points:  Strengths:  (a)  Derek comes from the Donahue Ernst and Young firm and to my knowledge is  a highly regarded commercial associate.  (b)  Prior to that he was at Macleod Dixon and a highly regarded commercial  associate there.  The Managing Partner of Donahue Ernst and Young Calgary  came from Macleod Dixon Calgary and brought Derek over with him.  (c)  Derek has never done any work for us, but I have met him socially a  number of times and have spoken to him about this job possibility.  I think  he has a down-to-earth and comfortable personality that would suit the  atmosphere and stresses of Enron well.  (d)  Derek was seconded internally to Husky Oil - one of DEY's major Calgary  clients - for a period and has experince in-house.  He worked for an internal  lawyer at Husky who is a friend of Greg Johnston and who gave excellent  reviews.  (e)  Although I do not have his law school grades, he tells me he finished in  the top third of his class at Queens University - which among the reputable  schools in Canada.  (f)  He is qualified both under Alberta and Ontario law.  (g)  He has met with Milnthorp and Greg Johnston, both of whom were favorably  impressed.  Issues:  (a)  Derek graduated from law school in '94 and since that time his career  has been a bit traveled.  Although there is an explanation, his continuous  experience at Macleod Dixon and Donahue Ernst and Young started in '97.   Before that the history is he is from a small town in Alberta.  After  graduating he wanted to work at a small firm in Toronto and had an interest  in labor law, and spent his first year articling to a Toronto labor  boutique.  After that year he wanted to get into commercial work and out  Toronto, and moved to Fraser Milner in Edmonton.  His wife then took a  position at Stikeman Elliott in Calgary however, and so he moved to Macleod  Dixon in Calgary.  He moved to Donahue Ernst and Young when they established  their office in Calgary.  All things being considered, I am comfortable with  his experience at say a 4 to 5 year level - although compensation could then  be an issue (I have not discussed compensation with him).  (b)  Derek's experience has been primarily in large commercial projects,  especially the off-shore oil and gas developments in Hibernia and Terra Nova  for Husky.  This would require some very good legal and large project  organizational skills but is obviously different from a faster paced,  commercially oriented, higher volume trading atmosphere.  In his secondment  to Husky however he was more involved in their retail gasoline business and  natural gas marketing and,  although I am sure not the atmosphere at Enron,  he tells me it is an atmosphere he is comfortable with and enjoys.  (c)  Do Jim Derrick's accounting/law firm concerns apply to hiring a lawyer  (as opposed to retaining counse)?  I would like to get back to Derek soon to discuss next steps (interview in  Houston? with whom? Vicki Sharp? get a feel for compensation expectations?),  or look to other alternatives.  Peter.

We hope to have agreed on the Q&A's by then and to send it out  the announcement on Thursday.  John  To be sent to:  All Enron Europe, all employees in Japan,  all Global Markets  and all VPs and up around the company  Enron has established several wholesale businesses in Japan in the last year  including Metals,  Power Plant Development (via our investment in EnCom),   Coal,  LNG & Weather.   Though Japan continues to make progress towards a  liberalized electricity market, significant barriers to power trading remain  under the current interim market structure.  Until further tangible steps are  taken to improve third party access for electricity in Japan, we will suspend  our power marketing efforts and focus on the significant opportunities that  currently exist in our other wholesale businesses.   Once the necessary  regulatory changes have been completed we expect to aggressively pursue  Enron's traditional position as the leading buyer and seller of electricity  in every deregulated market.    Based on these changes Joe Hirl our President of Enron Japan will move to the  Global Markets group and lead a team that will focus on developing all our  Global Markets opportunities in Japan especially Weather,  Oil,  LNG,  Coal,  and Shipping.    We expect to continue our general recruiting  of Japanese  nationals and as President of Enron Japan,  Joe will continue to provide the  overall business leadership to both recruiting and the Analyst and Associate  program in Japan.  The Finance origination team headed by Jeremy Thirsk will  continue to report to Joe and also move to Global Markets.  Our power trading  group led by Morton Erik Pettersen will transition into other roles around  Enron.  The Equity/FX/Interest rate team which is a part of Global Markets  has two employees in the Tokyo office today and they expect to expand their  efforts throughout the year.  The EnCom group, which is our power plant development business (with minority  partners) and headed by Carey Sloan will continue its efforts in developing  power plants in Japan.  We are pleased with the progress we are making on a  number of sites and EnCom will continue to report to the Enron Europe Office  of the Chairman.  Our Metals team headed by Kazunari Sugimoto will continue to report through  Enron Metals in London.  By May we expect Enron Credit to have two to three employees in Tokyo pursing  the Credit Derivative business.  These employees remain in  Enron Credit , a  part of Enron Europe.  EBS has two employees headed by Jim Weisser and this team expects to expand   by year end.  The Industrial Markets team also expects to have two employees in the Tokyo  office in the next couple of months.  In the last seven months the commercial support services for Japan have been  transitioned to London for support and this is not changing.  Jane McBride  heads the legal team and will continue to functionally report  to Mark Evans,  General Counsel in London.   The RAC function will continue to report to Ted  Murphy, head of RAC for Enron Europe.   The Risk Management and Accounting  team is headed by Jan-Erland Bekeng will continue to functionally report to  Fernley Dyson in London.  The  IT, HR,  Tax and real estate teams will also  continue to functionally report to London.   Nick O'Day who heads both the Public Affairs group (Government & Regulatory  Affairs and the Public Relations) in Japan will report to the Enron Europe  Office of the Chair with a Public Relations functional reporting to Jackie  Genle in London and a Government Affairs functional reporting to Rick  Shappiro in Houston.   We anticipate that his team's efforts will be  primarily directed to supporting the EnCom power plant development team but  he will also continue to provide support for Global Markets, EBS & Industrial  Markets.  We have already made considerable progress in breaking into the Japanese  markets across a wide range of Enron businesses and we anticipate that this  will be a major profit center for profit growth for years to come. Through  these current changes we can demonstrate our ability to be flexible and  target our resources where they will realise the most immediate value for the  company.

Of course we would have been much happier with an  outside date or target of November 1, 2001 or  an unconditional May 1, 2002  date; however, it at least shows a commitment to deregulation.   While Enron Toronto will be busy with ongoing marketing and certain major  projects in the near future (the OEFC NUG Contract Management Agreement, the  G6 retail initiative and the ENERconnect amendment),  the obvious umber one  priority of this office in the short term will be negotiating an extension to  the British Energy Supply Contract.  Regards  CJG  ----- Forwarded by Chris Gaffney/TOR/ECT on 04/23/2001 04:31 PM -----   Garrett Tripp  04/23/2001 04:11 PM        To: ECT Toronto    cc:     Subject: Jim Wilson's Statement   Mr. Speaker:  This Legislature passed the Energy Competition Act in 1998 to help meet the  province's long-term electricity needs and ensure that Ontarians have a safe,  reliable and affordable supply of power. When this government came to office in 1995, we had our work cut out for us.  Ontario's electricity sector was failing us. Consumers and businesses had no choice of who supplied them with power. And  we went from having one of the lowest prices for electricity to the third  highest in Canada.  The monopoly we had come to rely on for safe, reliable and  competitively-priced electricity was no longer working. It had become out of  date, inefficient and too expensive. Something had to be done. That's why I'm proud to stand up in the Legislature today to announce that: The government is confident that conditions necessary to open the electricity  market to competition will exist by May 2002. The government is committed to  an open market while guaranteeing a safe, affordable and reliable supply. There are some who are fundamentally opposed to opening this market to  competition. Our government believes, however, that open, competitive markets  are beneficial. They keep costs low, encourage innovation and benefit  consumers.  There are others who share our desire to open the market, but who would like  to see it done even sooner. As government, we bear a responsibility to ensure  the opening is done right for all involved. To do this, we are committed to  opening the market at the earliest possible date, while ensuring all of the  conditions required for a smooth transition to competition are met. And I'm pleased to tell you, Mr. Speaker, that the four principles guiding  the government's vision have been, or will be met, by May 2002.  First and foremost, protecting consumers and offering more choice. The  overall market design and regulatory framework for introducing competition  puts customers first. Over the long term, a competitive market will lead to  the lowest possible costs and better service for all.  Second, creating a strong business climate with a reliable supply of  electricity. Ontario already has sufficient supply to meet our current needs.  Announcing a firm market opening deadline today provides greater certainty to  potential new investors who have already announced 3 billion dollars in new  generation projects.  Thirdly, we will protect our environment. My colleague, the Minister of the  Environment has announced tough new emission caps for the electricity sector.  They will be among the toughest in North America, matching the requirements  of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Also today, Minister Witmer is announcing changes to ensure that new  electricity projects are reviewed in a clear and consistent manner under the  province's environmental assessment process. And fourth, we will encourage new ways of doing business and support the  search for alternative sources of power. For the first time, customers will  be able to make clean air a priority by choosing the type of power they want,  including wind, fuel cells and solar. Giving them choice will help promote  the demand for cleaner, greener electricity.  And so, Mr. Speaker, I am proud to announce that Ontario's electricity sector  will open by May 2002. The government is keeping its promise to introduce a  competitive electricity market. We will do it, and we have put the principles  in place to ensure that we do it right.  Thank you.

Corporate Structure - To facilitate the meshing of EES' existing Canadian  affiliate (Enron Energy Services Canada Co. Ltd. (""EES Canada"")) and Enron  Canada Corp.'s mass market retail venture (Enron Direct Limited Partnership  (""Enron Direct Canada"")), I propose a simple corporate structure as follows:  Enron Direct Canada's business will be set up as a subsidiary of EES Canada.   This will involve: a. a general conveyance of the assets of Enron Direct Canada to its general  partner, Enron Direct Canada Corp.; b. the sale of the shares of Enron Direct Canada Corp. from Enron Canada  Corp. to EES Canada; and c.  a services agreement whereby Enron Canada Corp. provides key services to  Enron Direct Canada.  By setting up Enron Direct Canada as a distinct subsidiary of EES Canada,  both entities will continue to operate as they do today.  As such, (i) Enron Direct Canada will continue to be operated by the staff  currently in place in Calgary, but within the EES corporate structure, and  (ii) EES Canada's existing business will continue to be operated as it is  currently.  B.  Governance - I understand from Peter that a few years back, it was  decided, for corporate law and, more importantly, tax-related ""permanent  establishment"" issues, that all directors and officers of Enron Canada Corp.  would be Canadian-resident employees of Enron Canada Corp.  Accordingly,  Enron Canada Corp. was re-organized with a nominee board of directors now  consisting of Rob (as the senior Canadian commercial employee) and Peter (as  the senior Canadian legal employee) with officers being the Vice-Presidents  or Managing Directors in Canada responsible for the various commercial or  commercial-support groups.   Following this model, Rob Milnthorp and an employee from the legal department  would appear to be the appropriate directors of the EES' Canadian  subsidiaries.  In the short term, the Iegal employee/designee would be me;  however, the new lawyer hired to work for Enron Direct Canada would assume  the role.   With respect to the officers, no changes are required with respect to Enron  Direct Canada.  With respect to EES Canada, I propose that Rob be appointed  as the Chairman, President and CEO and I be appointed as Secretary for the  interim.  Unless I hear otherwise, I will proceed on the basis of these proposals.

The concern is that having officers and  directors located outside of the country of incorporation of the subsidiary  could provide a basis for a country other than the one where the subsidiary  is incorporated to assert taxing jurisdiction (the PE issue).  That said, I  appreciate the control concern and so long as the authority of the  non-Canadian Director is never exercised outside of Canada (of course, this  presents a proof issue) having a non-Canadian Director is permissible (from a  tax perspective, that is).

Corporate Structure - To facilitate the meshing of EES' existing Canadian  affiliate (Enron Energy Services Canada Co. Ltd. (""EES Canada"")) and Enron  Canada Corp.'s mass market retail venture (Enron Direct Limited Partnership  (""Enron Direct Canada"")), I propose a simple corporate structure as follows:  Enron Direct Canada's business will be set up as a subsidiary of EES Canada.   This will involve: a. a general conveyance of the assets of Enron Direct Canada to its general  partner, Enron Direct Canada Corp.; b. the sale of the shares of Enron Direct Canada Corp. from Enron Canada  Corp. to EES Canada; and c.  a services agreement whereby Enron Canada Corp. provides key services to  Enron Direct Canada.  By setting up Enron Direct Canada as a distinct subsidiary of EES Canada,  both entities will continue to operate as they do today.  As such, (i) Enron Direct Canada will continue to be operated by the staff  currently in place in Calgary, but within the EES corporate structure, and  (ii) EES Canada's existing business will continue to be operated as it is  currently.  B.  Governance - I understand from Peter that a few years back, it was  decided, for corporate law and, more importantly, tax-related ""permanent  establishment"" issues, that all directors and officers of Enron Canada Corp.  would be Canadian-resident employees of Enron Canada Corp.  Accordingly,  Enron Canada Corp. was re-organized with a nominee board of directors now  consisting of Rob (as the senior Canadian commercial employee) and Peter (as  the senior Canadian legal employee) with officers being the Vice-Presidents  or Managing Directors in Canada responsible for the various commercial or  commercial-support groups.   Following this model, Rob Milnthorp and an employee from the legal department  would appear to be the appropriate directors of the EES' Canadian  subsidiaries.  In the short term, the Iegal employee/designee would be me;  however, the new lawyer hired to work for Enron Direct Canada would assume  the role.   With respect to the officers, no changes are required with respect to Enron  Direct Canada.  With respect to EES Canada, I propose that Rob be appointed  as the Chairman, President and CEO and I be appointed as Secretary for the  interim.

The concern is that having officers and  directors located outside of the country of incorporation of the subsidiary  could provide a basis for a country other than the one where the subsidiary  is incorporated to assert taxing jurisdiction (the PE issue).  That said, I  appreciate the control concern and so long as the authority of the  non-Canadian Director is never exercised outside of Canada (of course, this  presents a proof issue) having a non-Canadian Director is permissible (from a  tax perspective, that is).

"Hello Mark,  Both Bob and myself have left messages to speak with you about email  retention time.  Those messages must have been lost, so I have decided to try  email.  The group we work in, Technical Power Services,  is project oriented.  We are  an extension of the Engineering department.  As you are well aware the  development, and construction of power projects can be a minimum of 9 months,  to as long as 4 years plus.  To give an example, the work that has been  started on the coal initiative. At $4-$5 mmbtu for gas, the development of  coal plants becomes more economical.  This development is just starting,  nothing will be decided for a couple of years, then if it goes ahead  construction could easily be 3 years or more.  What we are trying to stress is the information that is started in the  beginning of a project needs flow through to the end of the project, which in  most instances is longer than a year.  Some of the current power projects we are developing have COD date in 2002 to  2004.  The retention of email is important to the projects.  The companies that we deal with will be keeping the correspondence and if we  don't have our own copies, I think you know where this is going.  We would like to discuss this with you.  There has been folders set up in the  Public mailbox system to give us more than the 100MB limit.  This is very  helpful since some drawings files we receive can be over 10MB.

"mark, an issues update:  1. timing issues--sithe has extended the time for potential tollers to give  comments back on the tolling and related agreements until next friday, may  12. final bids are not yet in and will probably be coming in as late as a  week after that (may 19). we anticipate some real negotiation on the  documentation and some issues that may be hard to resolve. our restructure  document negotiations will be running a parallel path. this is a lot to  accomplish, particularly with marty's torturous page-turning, wear you down  negotiating style and the fact that he will be involved in all. marty has  said he sees his june 1 date slipping.  2.bondholder issues--we have issues in addition to our consent issue that we  have discussed. with respect to one of the transport pieces with transcanada,  it signed a consent directly running to the bondholders that arguably it  could be breaching if it consented to the assignment of the transport to us.  marty's lawyer is clearly worried about this and transcanada is likely to at  least ask for an indemnity from sithe and/or us. business guys are discussing  splitting that risk 55 sithe/45 us, the partnership split under the proposed  restructured deal. additionally, we have been asked to agree that the  transport assigned to us is pledged to the bondholders and in essence agree  that we will indemnify the bondholders directly if we do not make the  transport contract payments. that number has potentially moved from $190  million to a significantly larger number ($350 million???). seems like the  toller may have some concern with bondholder  issues potentially in trying to  protect itself during this long tolling period. this obviously could affect  timing. bondholders are likely to have QF concerns as well (both on our side  and with PECO). hard to tell what the business strategy is right now with  respect to informing the bondholders about the transactions.  3.limitation on sithe liability--sithe served us very skinny documents,  including no reps and warrranties except basically as to title, and those  came from a shell subsidiary where it is dropping its interest (supposedly  for tax purposes) and disappeared at closing. there will need to be  significant push back on a number of fronts to get some fairer documents.  4.tax issues--leboeuf and steve douglas are working on, but there is a  potential for disconnect between the two sides as to tax treatment that we  are trying to run to ground. the deal is so tight and so structured that we  worry that a disconnect could make a deal hard to do.  5.due diligence--the business guys have not really done. le boeuf has been  geared up to help starting monday (financial, plant, material contracts).

"As promised, here is a Cliff's Notes version of the law of quantum meruit in  the State of Texas.  The doctrine of quantum meruit is based on the principle of equity that a  party deserves to be paid for the services or materials he furnishes to one  who knowingly accepts them. See Davidson v. Clearman, 391 S .W.2d 48  (Tex.1965). This remedy is based on the promise implied by law to pay for  beneficial services rendered and accepted. Id.; see Campbell v. Northwestern  Nat'l Life Ins. Co., 573 S.W.2d 496, 498 (Tex.1978). The Texas Supreme Court  in Bashara v. Baptist Mem'l Hosp. Sys., 685 S.W.2d 307 (Tex.1985), set out  four elements for recovery under quantum meruit: (1) valuable services  rendered or materials furnished; (2) for the person sought to be charged; (3)  which were accepted by the person sought to be charged and were used and  enjoyed by him; (4) under such circumstances that he would reasonably know  that the plaintiff expected to be paid for the services.

There are several cases -- all outside the State of Texas -- in which  recruiting agencies seek recovery under the doctrine of quantum meruit from  companies with whom they have placed an individual.  Cutting to the chase,  the fundamental inquiry in such a case -- have the elements of quantum meruit  been satisfied? -- ends up being a factual issue for a jury to decide, not a  legal question for a judge.

"Mark, I wanted to make you aware of a DASH that will be circulated in the  next day or so regarding the sale by Enron Canada of its entire interest in  Invasion Energy Inc., a private oil and gas company.  The Canadian subsidiary  of The Wiser Oil Company made an offer to acquire all of the shares of  Invasion as well as the debt owing to ECC and an overriding royalty granted  to ECC by Invasion.  ECC owns approximately 65% of the issued and outstanding  shares of Invasion, has debt outstanding from Invasion in the amount of CDN.  $23 million and the royalty, which is valued at approximately CDN $2.2  million.  The DASH outlines the benefits to ECC of this transaction, which  are significant given that we are realizing an approximate 83% return on our  equity investment and 19% return on the debt.  The total purchase price (for  all shares as well as the Enron debt and Enron royalty) is in the amount,  prior to adjustments, of CDN $53 million.  Other than standard closing risk inherent in any transaction of this nature,  the only real legal risk, which I have identified in the DASH, is regarding  the survival of representations and warranties.  We have mitigated the risk  associated with such survival by:  1.  Restricting the survival period to 6 months following closing 2.  Capping the aggregate liability for all claims to CDN $7 million 3.

"Mark (and Mark) are there any concerns with Enron Direct Canada (EDC) (the  mass markets retail affiliate, that is soon to be a subsidiary of EES) as  opposed to Enron Canada (as wholesale affiliate of ENA) entering into  financial transactions?  To date EDC has been entering into physical  transactions only for gas and power under forms that have been developed  based upon our wholesale physical contracts, Enron Direct UK's form, and  compliance with the local regulatory requirements for retailers.  If EDC was  to enter into financial transactions, they would tend to be papered under  omnibus financial GTCs with EDC (as ISDAs would likely not be marketable).   Of course credit would need to be obtained in advance, and the transactions  are not booked until the counterparty executes the paper.  Please let me know.

I  am involved with a potential power plant development project with the  Seminole Indian Tribe of Florida.  The project would be on their land and  would potentially involve a joint venture with them.  Although we are at a  preliminary stage, even the initial letter of intent that we are negotiating  raises unique issues that will set the precedent for our project development  agreements with respect to enforceability, jurisdiction and dispute  resolution matters.    I have identified and spoken with Lynn Slade of the New Mexico law firm of  Modrall, Sperling, Roehl, Harris & Sisk on whether he could advise us on the  Indian law issues associated with this project.  Lynn and several of his  colleagues specialize on Indian law matters, and Lynn has experience both  with representing Enron and in handling energy transactions in general.  In  fact, Lynn gave a presentation at the 1999 Enron law conference entitled  ""Energy Business in 'Indian Country': Opportunities and Obstacles"" (credit  goes to Jeff Hodge for remembering that presentation and suggesting I contact  Lynn); Lynn has represented several of Enron's pipeline companies, as well as  the government affairs department, in connection with their Indian law issues  and, at one time, prepared an opinion letter for ENA in a transaction  involving the Ute tribe.    Lastly, please note that I had asked our Florida counsel of Greenberg Trauig  on whether they had any Indian law expertise, including specifically, any  experience involving the Seminoles.  Unfortunately, the Seminoles are one of  their clients so Greenberg cannot represent us in a manner adverse to the  Tribe.    Thanks in advance for your attention and consideration of this request.

Our credit trading group is starting to build up a Japan team (out of London)  and the person who will head that group and has just started with us here in  Tokyo is Mike Gordon (email address above).  Mike has indicated that he would  like to get involved with ISDA here and I recall that last year we discussed  getting some Enron traders involved in ISDA so this may be a good start.  I understand that the above newly established group has only met once here to  date and wonder if you would mind making direct contact with Mike, when you  have a chance, to let him know what is happening with the group here and  details of the next meeting.

Although ENA was very responsive, I did  not find their comments substantive but rather style/preference oriented.  Given that this was the first time they had seen this document, I was  somewhat surprised. Jim Keller (who worked with Debbie) and Debbie reviewed   them and took some of their suggestions and ignored others. I don't  think  ENA completely understands the retail business as some of their comments were  more wholesale oriented. Debbie can give you her view as well as information  on the ""process"" the two legal departments used to work through the document.  I do not know what  conversations Don Black had with ENA legal.   I think what frustrated Hector and me so much was the number of people who  had to review the contract, make suggestions, the suggestions had to be  incorporated into the document (which, remember, Sysco had already seen  once), then re-reviewed by the person making the suggestion. I realize that  we are breaking new ground and that it is a California contract but there  needs to be a better, less time consuming and smoother way.   I have listed below most of the people who reviewed the contract (to the best  of my memory). Several of these individuals were difficult to corner as this  was not really their responsibility but given the state (California), were  asked to do so.

"I wanted to update you on my request to retain Lynn Slade of Modrall Sperling  for a power plant development transaction involving the Seminole Tribe of  Florida.  In requesting Jim Derrick's approval, he asked that I contact Jim  McCartney of Vinson & Elkins to discuss such a retention because Jim  McCartney who has had extensive Enron experience regarding our right-of-way  agreements through Indian country and recently had a mixed experience with  Lynn Slade.   Jim has been both candid and very helpful.  He has recommended  that the better approaches would be either to retain Mike Webster, an Indian  lawyer in Montana, or find a lawyer in Florida who has had direct experience  with Seminoles.  More importantly, Jim graciously offered to review the  preliminary letter of intent that we are negotiating and offer his comments  based on his general Indian law experience.  He will charge the limited  amount of time that will be required for this review against his general  retainer that he has with Jim Derrick.  At this preliminary stage, I believe  that Jim's review and comments will suffice for purposes of getting advice on  the letter of intent and I will continue to pursue identifying a  Florida-based lawyer with experience in dealing with the Seminoles.

The attached documents, including the agenda, a memo on the Bridge agreement, and a copy of the Bridge agreement, were reviewed at this morning's meeting.   Much of the discussion focused on explanation of the Bridge Agreement. There was some discussion about the German regulatory structure and the bridge agreement.  Katia ran through the agenda in Houston and asked for ideas on December conference.  I was not able to hear all of the questions entirely but questions were asked about the outcome of the meeting.  Katia and Christophe explained that it was a forum to exchange ideas and to promote use of ISDA within industry. The minutes should give us more detail.    In addition to a call re: the NA agenda, I think it would be worthwhile to also have a call w/Christophe, Katia and John Berry to discuss European activities and to begin discussion on the December agenda.

"Mark, as we discussed, I see one of the growing legal risks for Canada (and  perhaps elsewhere) resulting from ""retail"" deregulation and the pressure to  increase transaction flow/market scope in energy markets by transacting  behind and through the distribution company (or at ""point of delivery"").   Although generally speaking this is described as ""retail"", it also affects  ""wholesale"" as (i) EWS will manage risk for EES, and (ii) the distinctions  between ""retail"" and ""wholesale"" are not always clear (ex. depending on size  and complexity, traders/originators in EWS will do ""point of delivery""  transactions).    The risks tend to be additional to the customary commodity, price, legal and  credit risk management in wholesale transactions, as they also involve: (i)  volume/load balancing risk between the counterparty and the Disco,  particularly for ""all requirements"", ""use"" or ""load following"" transactions  and particularly where the balancing obligation between the counterparty and  the Disco is ""unhedged"" or ""mismatched"" (ex. balancing with the counterparty  for excess or unused volumes may be at daily index on the date of  consumption, whereas balancing with the Disco may be at the monthly index for  the next month based on actual, estimated or aggregated data); (ii) terms and  conditions/tariff risk to the Disco (ex. the distribution terms and  conditions/tariffs pass a number of risks on to the commodity supplier, such  as obligations to continue delivery after counterparty default or  termination, options to the Disco to source supply after default or  termination, broad third party indemnifications to the Disco for conduct of  the counterparty, allocation of force majeure risk (that may differ from the  counterparty agreement); (iii) additional or incremental credit obligations  to the Disco; and (iv) pressure in these markets to used more simplified  (often government regulated) non-master contract forms - although the forms  used tend to be more unilateral to the commodity supplier.  The mitigant is to understand clearly both the formal and practical market,  rules, requirements, procedures, regulations and distribution terms and  conditions applicable to delivering the commodity behind and through the  Disco, if possible to get involved in shaping those in a proactive way  through the deregulation process, and developing risk management procedures  around the formal and practical requirements of the market.  For your risk memo you could briefly describe the risk as:  ""Point of  Delivery Risk (retail or wholesale) for energy commodities behind and through  the Distribution Company, including balancing commodity use between the Disco  and the customer, distribution tariff/terms and conditions risks, incremental  credit obligations between wholesale markets and the Disco, and commercial  and regulatory requirements for contracting.""

Mark, This article confirms your skepticism about the CDWR deal.  Davis is already  planning to violate confidentiality provisions of CDWR contracts signed  earlier this year.  The State of California simply cannot be trusted to honor  its agreements.   Look at Davis's spin on breaching contract provisions:  State negotiators  ""worried little about the [confidentiality] clauses"" in their haste to sign  the contracts, but now, ""administration officials insisted they are  attempting to find a way around the secrecy clauses in long-term contracts."" From here it is a very small step for Davis to justify breaking long-term  contracts once prices go down in a year or two:  ""We didn't think a lot about  the prices we were paying at the time because we were just trying to keep the  lights on.  But now we are attempting to find a way around the payment  clause."" * * * On another note, thank you for meeting with me on Wednesday.  I am thrilled  to be working for Enron.  Meeting with you, Jim Derrick, and others in the  legal department reinforced my decision to join your company.  I am excited  about our prospects for the future and will work hard to continue to add  value and keep your confidence.  Best regards, Steve  Davis to divulge details of costly energy buys  By Steve Geissinger SACRAMENTO BUREAU  SACRAMENTO -- Amid mounting attacks on Gov. Gray Davis' energy-crisis  secrecy, administration officials said Thursday they will soon begin  revealing full details of the state's costly, last-minute power purchases  aimed at thwarting blackouts.  The Davis administration told ANG Newspapers that in the next two weeks it  will start disclosing information on the initial, multimillion-dollar  purchases it made on the volatile spot market in January.  In doing so, the administration will begin honoring Davis' promise to reveal  the details after a period of six months or less. The governor said  disclosing the information any earlier would compromise efforts to hold down  power costs.  But there has been a growing chorus of protest of the secrecy from  open-government advocates, consumer activists, Republican lawmakers and  others.  GOP legislators and news agencies have filed separate lawsuits, under the  state's Public Records Act, seeking disclosure of details on about $8 billion  in emergency, short-term purchases and additional billions on less costly,  years-long contracts.  A San Diego Superior Court judge is scheduled to issue initial rulings on the  lawsuits today in San Diego.  On Thursday, the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights called on  Californians to phone the governor's office in protest.  ""The public has a right to know how our money is being spent and who is  getting it,"" said Harvey Rosenfield, the group's director.  The governor ""won't let us look at them (contracts) to make sure they won't  cause further rate hikes in future years,"" Rosenfield said.  ""It is also important to know how much power he has negotiated for this  summer so we can determine how much it will cost us to stop the blackouts,""  he said. ""We believe the governor is refusing to divulge because the  contracts are inflated and contain damaging provisions.""  Administration officials dismissed critics' assertions and said that full  disclosure will eventually come when the data is no longer a sensitive  marketing matter.  Officials acknowledged for the first time, however, that some of the state's  less costly, long-term power contracts with generators contain secrecy  clauses that may prevent public disclosure.  The administration said state negotiators were so intent on securing less  expensive, long-term power supplies that authorities worried little about the  clauses requiring them to keep terms of the contracts secret unless they have  the suppliers' permission to divulge them  Though violating the agreement could void the contracts, industry  representatives said they doubted generators would break existing pacts.  Suppliers might, however, sign no more contracts with the state, the  representatives said.  ""Apparently there are some contracts with that (secrecy clause), and our  legal people are looking at it,"" said Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio. ""I  don't know what the end result is going to be, but it's the governor's intent  to release the contracts.""  While administration officials insisted they are attempting to find a way  around the secrecy clauses in long-term contracts, they said disclosure of  the initial short-term purchases will soon begin.  Maviglio said the administration will start posting the details of  short-term, spot-market buys made in mid-January within the next two weeks on  the Internet, easing a controversy that has enveloped two of Davis' fellow  Democratic statewide elected officials.  State Controller Kathleen Connell scrapped plans to reveal the costly state  power bills in February during a dramatic, 11th-hour reversal under pressure  from the Davis administration.  The controller, who has emerged as a sharp critic of the administration's  handling of the energy crisis, indefinitely postponed plans to put  information from electricity-purchase invoices on the Internet and canceled a  news conference to announce the disclosures.  In March, Attorney General Bill Lockyer, representing Davis in this instance,  provided Connell with a letter of advice that the governor is not legally  bound to reveal the details of billions of dollars in state power purchases.  Lockyer's letter said the public's interest in maintaining confidentiality in  matters relating to negotiations between the state and prospective power  contractors far outweighed its interest in disclosure.  But Lockyer, a former East Bay politician, said last week he personally  favors making public the details of the purchases.  ""In my mind at least, and as a matter of philosophy, the expenditures are so  extraordinary, the issues are so important, that the contracts ... need to be  made public,"" he said at the annual meeting of the National Freedom of  Information Coalition.  Open-government advocates point to a recent poll conducted for the California  First Amendment Coalition that indicates seven out of 10 Californians believe  they are getting too little information about how state officials are  responding to the power shortage, and a whopping 86 percent want details of  long-term power purchasing contracts made public.  ""Californians reject government secrecy as a matter of law in the state's  Open Government Act,"" said Kent Pollock, the coalition's executive director.  ""The poll results are an overwhelming repudiation of state policies that  shield information from public scrutiny.""

"After our discussion this afternoon, I have given some additional thought --  and talked to outside counsel -- about the negative potential consequences of  filing an arbitration against El Paso.  While I think we should accept the  risks, here they are all from our vantage point:  First, El Paso could move the Swap Agreements from EPME and claim the Guaranty Agreements do not follow.    Second, we could lose on our claims.  This would give El Paso the right to  move the Swap Agreements from EPME and claim the Guaranty Agreements do not  follow.   Third, El Paso could fight us on the arbitrability of the Guaranty Agreement claim.  We could end up with two proceedings -- our arbitration and a court proceeding El Paso initiates on the Guaranty Agreement claim. Unfortunately, El Paso would have the opportunity to choose the forum on the Guaranty Agreement claim.  Fourth, El Paso could counterclaim on the breach of the confidentiality provision.  I think they would have a good argument that we have breached that provision by showing the Swap Agreements etc. to people outside the company such as our bankers.  I am not clear what damages they could claim based on that alleged breach.  I haven't heard anything to suggest there are other claims out there for El Paso to assert, but we haven't done much investigating in that area either. I suppose if El Paso got really mad, they might look back over the  negotiations in this deal and others to see if they have any other claims  they could construct.
